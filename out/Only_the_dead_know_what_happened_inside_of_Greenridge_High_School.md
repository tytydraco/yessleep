There is something wrong with Greenridge High School. After months of researching and planning, I’m ready to go back and find the truth. I need to know the truth about my missing sister and I need to find out how 13 teenagers were killed without anyone batting an eye. 

If you don’t remember me, that’s okay. My name is Cassandra, and 6 months ago, a man named Caleb ran into me at Greenridge High School, and after that, my life changed forever. Caleb was exploring the high school because he felt drawn to it while I was exploring because I wanted to find information about my sister, Hannah. Someone attacked Hannah and my brother on the same day, but she escaped. My little brother wasn’t so lucky and was murdered in the boy's locker room. 

Together, Caleb and I thought that we put an end to the horrors of Greenridge. Caleb even “saved” some lives. Caleb possesses the ability to rip spirits from the afterlife and bring them back to the land of the living. I don’t. Instead, it seems that I can speak to specific spirits. Spirits who were glowing red, and we never found out what each color met. 

Now that I have you all caught up buckle up because things have gotten a whole lot worse. 

\-

After Caleb and I went our separate ways, I had to revisit the information I had about Hannah. Kiria, Hunter, and Coraline were a major help during this process. The first thing I had to do was revisit what my mother told me. She told me that Hannah escaped from the girl’s locker room window and found her way home. I don’t know what happened before or after that. I was still attending college when I heard about what happened.

The first chance I got, I rushed home; the first thing I wanted to do was check on my sister. I was able to catch the first available plane back to my hometown. When I got home, there was nobody at the house. My parents were gone, all of their stuff was packed, most of it was missing, although there were some suitcases left behind. 

At first, I thought maybe they had taken my sister to the hospital; I assumed they were staying there because of the attack. I called the hospital, and they told me they didn’t have anyone from my family staying there.

I tried to call my mother and then my father; I left maybe 20 messages for my sister and no one got back to me. When it became apparent that everybody was gone, I called the police and filed missing person reports.

In the meantime, I searched the house to see if I could find any sign of where they went. After a few hours of searching, I eventually found a piece of paper in my sister's bedroom hidden where she normally kept her spare cell phone. 

I’ve read over that paper too many times to count. 

Hannah left me a note saying that our parents were taking her out of the state so that she could relax. I was confused for two reasons: The first is because my brother was murdered and I never heard anything about a funeral for him. The second was because my mom called me and told me Hannah wanted to see me; it was the whole reason I came home so soon. 

It took the police weeks to get back to me. 

They thought I was lying to them. They told me that I owned the house that my parents were living in. There was no record of anyone else living there, and there was no record of Hannah ever attending Greenridge High School. 

I was in a pretty dark place for a month before I eventually decided to go back and check the school. During my time exploring, I ran into multiple killers, but could never find what I was looking for. It wasn’t until I met Caleb that things slowly became more clear to me. 

My brother and sister were not the only ones attacked. Dozens of teenagers were attacked, and many were murdered on the school grounds. After relaying this information to Hunter, Coraline, and Kira, we all concluded that the only way to get answers was to return to Greenridge. 

\-

Before I could return to Greenridge, I had to make sure everything we found in the basement was sorted. It was a rough couple of weeks, especially without Caleb. Kira has been suffering from extreme nightmares, and Coraline was still keeping to herself. Hunter is the most normal teenager out of the bunch; you would never guess he had died.

Together, we sorted through everything that we brought back. I figured it would keep them occupied since they couldn’t leave the house. 

There was a lot of evidence on the basement wall, so I’m just going to tell you about what was the most interesting. 

The book that the boy was clinging to was a sketchbook. It belonged to someone named Liam. I assume that Liam was the spirit in the basement. Inside the book, there were a lot of drawings of the killer who wears the mascot head. Liam drew the killer on the football field a lot. The only other drawings of interest were of the groundskeeper. 

I used the picture of Hannah that I pulled off of the wall to find her homeroom. Her homeroom was room 42. Finding this information gave me an objective, I was going to go there and see if I could find anything belonging to her. 

Finally, whoever created the crime board in the basement was keeping track of the groundskeeper. We found multiple photos of him tending the grass. The person who was watching him made a lot of notes detailing that the school never hired a groundskeeper. They also noted that the groundskeeper wouldn’t speak to them. 

\-

“We need to come with you. You can’t do this without Caleb!” Kira protested. She was angry that I was leaving them at the house, but I couldn’t risk taking them with me. If something happened to them, I would never forgive myself. 

Coraline and Hunter didn’t argue much, and I did my best to reassure them that I would be back as soon as possible. I made sure they each had a weapon, just in case, and left them specific instructions to call Caleb if I wasn’t back within three days. 

Once everything on the home front was settled, it was time for me to return to Greenridge. 

\-

As I drove to the school, this time a lot was weighing on me. Caleb said it felt like something was calling him to the high school like it was the place he was supposed to be. Meanwhile, I had no feelings for Greenridge. 

I thought about how my sister escaped a murderer and there was no record of it. It’s like every mention of Hannah disappeared from public record. There were no newspaper articles, no online posts, nothing. 

The more I thought about it, the stranger it became. There were no records of these kids and no online profiles for any of them. None of the murders made the papers, and finding any information about Greenridge was impossible. 

Once I got closer to the school, a feeling of impending dread washed over me. I was hoping I could do this without running into any spirits. I don’t possess the power to bring them back, and listening to them getting murdered was not something I wanted to do. 

As I pulled into the parking lot, I made sure to keep an eye out for the groundskeeper; he wasn’t outside, and I didn’t want to take any chances with him. Before getting out of the car, I made sure to grab my backpack and take the crowbar from my back seat. I slowly opened my car door and jogged across the parking lot right to the front doors of the school. 

I took my flashlight out of the side pocket of my backpack and reached for the door. I inhaled and slowly pulled the door open; every bone in my body was telling me to go back. My heart was beating so fast, I could hear it in my chest. I felt nauseous. 

The lights were still on. The whole building looked different when it wasn’t dark. The lights only made me feel more uneasy. I put my flashlight back into the side pocket of my backpack and tightened my grip on the crowbar. 

I was expecting a killer to come running at me, especially as I walked toward the staircase in the front hall. Hearing my shoes squeak when they hit the floor made my skin crawl: It took me a minute to remember the janitor. He was probably still walking around, keeping the school as clean as possible. 

Walking up the stairs felt like I was trudging up a mountain. Every time we saw the killer who wears the mascot head, he was standing up here. If I hadn’t gone through the basement evidence first, I would have been completely lost. All the homerooms and the main classrooms were on the second floor. 

\-

As I made my way down the first hallway, I could feel my hands starting to shake. The air up here felt heavier, like the weight of the school itself was pushing my body down. The feeling of walking around upstairs was so different that I considered turning around a few times. 

I was trying to take in as many details as possible, but each of the lockers was still closed. I ran my hand along them and paused when I noticed some deep scuff marks in a couple of the lockers. I kept walking until I found a corkboard at the end of the hallway; as I started reading the notices a wave of confusion rushed over me. 

**Class of 2013 Orientation at 8:00.**

My sister went to school here in 2015. 

I reached up to lift the poster. The flier under it read: 

**Class of 2012’ Orientation at 8:00.** 

The posters went back to 2011. All over the corkboard, there were references to events happening in 2013. From prom cancellations to school events, and something called the Full Moon Parade: Attendance was mandatory for that one. It was celebrated during the school day. 

I didn’t get any more time to look around before I heard whistling behind me. 

\-

I moved faster down the hallway and pressed my back to the wall so I could listen to the footsteps. My heart was beating so fast I thought that I was going to have a heart attack. 

My grip on the crowbar was so tight it started hurting my hand. As the whistling grew louder, I could feel the hairs on my arms stand up. My left eye twitched, my lip quivered, and my knees were shaking. 

“Hello?” a voice hissed. 

I heard a door open and promptly slam shut. Whoever this was just entered the hallway. I couldn’t believe it; another new killer? Whoever or whatever it was really wanted my attention. When he spoke, it felt like I was going to throw up. 

“I won’t hurt you.” The voice called out as another door opened. 

I got as low to the floor as I could and crawled to the next hallway. I had to crawl using one arm because I didn’t have time to put the crowbar in my bag, not like I wanted to let it go, anyway. I could feel the sweat pouring down my face. My body was shaking horribly, but I knew that I had to keep moving. As I turned down the next hallway, I tried to check as many of the doors as possible. Eventually, I found room 42 halfway down the hallway. 

\-



I reached up with my free hand to grab the doorknob. I slowly tightened my hand around the doorknob and turned it; as I pushed the door open, it squeaked. My heart was skipping beats. 

The whistling stopped as I slipped into the room. 

I took a glance around the room and my eyes landed on a familiar backpack. Hannah’s backpack was sitting right there. I couldn’t believe it. I tried to speed walk across the room and grab the bag. The moment I took the backpack strap in my hand, the whistling started again. It was much closer this time. 

I took the bag with one hand and ran to the closet as fast as I could. I slowly opened the closet door and slipped inside, shutting it behind me. 

The whistling stopped outside of the classroom door. Hearing the door creak open caused a wave of anxiety to wash over my body. When the doorknob hit the wall, I jumped. It took all the willpower in my body to stay silent. 

I could see the man walking around the classroom through the slits in the closet door. I knew that if he looked hard enough, he would be able to see me here. 

My heart sounded like a hammer hitting a brick wall. 

The man was wearing a black suit. His brown hair was neatly slicked back. As he walked around the room, I noticed his dirt-covered black shoes and bruised hands. 

“If you come out right now, I won’t call your parents.” He hissed as he searched the room. 

Tears were streaming down my face. I didn’t know why I was crying. Listening to this man was the first time in a long time that I felt this scared. This fear was visceral; I felt it in my bones. 

As he walked towards the closet, I watched my life flash before my eyes. 

“Found you, kiddo.” He said as he reached forward and opened the closet door. 

\-

I watched his eyes line up with the slits in the closet. We were making eye contact. His eyes were a deep black with a white dot right in the middle. It was like looking into the eyes of the devil himself. 

The moment he ripped the door open, I screamed and slammed my shoulder into him. It was like slamming into a wall. 

I brought the backpack up and swung it as hard as possible at his head. I heard it make contact and took the opportunity to slip by him. I thought I had a chance to run, but that was before something hit the side of my leg. 

I cried out in pain and fell forward. I could feel the blood rushing down my leg. I turned quickly and swung the crowbar back, hoping to hit him, but he simply moved out of the way. 

“You’re going to detention.” He snapped. 

I felt his hand grab me by my hood and drag me to my feet. I tried to swing the crowbar one last time, but he used his free hand to grab it and twist it. I held on as long as I could, but once I heard a sharp pop come from my wrist, I had to let the crowbar go. 

I cried out in pain and kicked my legs as much as I could. 

“There’s no use struggling.” He said as he walked towards the door. 

I was not going to find out what detention was. 

I let my sister's bag go and quickly moved my hand to unzip my hoodie. I fell out of the jacket and reached down quickly to grab the bag. I somehow managed to grab my sister's backpack and my own. This time when I ran for the door, I made sure to move my body to the side before I could be hit. 

I heard something break behind me, but I didn’t stop to see what it was. 

I ran out of the classroom door and screamed at the top of my lungs. I was hoping that the janitor would help me. Maybe another spirit would hear me and intervene. But something was different on the second floor, something felt wrong. 

\-

As I scrambled into the hallway, my leg nearly gave out. I finally looked down to see what was stuck in it: a serrated ruler. I slid my bag up my arm a little and reached down; I pulled the ruler out and squealed. I wasn’t as fast as before, but when I heard the whistling starting up again I tried to hustle. 

My leg buckled, and I finally hit the floor; I thought this was it. I tried to breathe, scream, and even keep crawling, but it felt like my mind was shutting down. I had never experienced anything like this before. 

“Hold on!” I heard a man yell at me; I could hear shooting ringing out from in front of me. 

“The gun doesn’t work, remember?” Another voice snapped. 

“It will slow this bastard down! Grab the woman, and let’s go!” The man called again. 

\-

I felt a hand take my wrist and start dragging me along the floor. I tried to protest, but I couldn’t speak. Once my body started hitting the carpet, I heard a door slam behind me. Suddenly, I was turned on my back. 

A blonde man took me by my chin and examined my face. 

“What is your name?” He asked me. 

I swallowed and coughed a little; “Cassandra.” I managed to spit out. 

“What are you doing here?” He asked as he reached into his pocket. I was expecting him to draw a weapon, so I flinched back. 

“Don’t worry, it’s just a hydration packet.” He murmured. 

“I was looking for information about my sister, Hannah,” I said as he let me go and placed a blue packet on my leg. I let my body slump backward and closed my eyes for a second. 

“You can’t rest now; we have to move.” The man said as he tapped my side. I slowly opened my eyes and sat up; pain shot up my leg and into my hip. I moved my hand up to pinch my nose and choke back some tears. 

“I know it hurts but we have to move.” A woman said as she took my arm and pulled me to my feet. She moved my arm over her neck to help me stand up. 

“Who are you?” I finally asked as I looked at the group of four. 

“My name is Emily.” Emily offered me a smile, but the woman looked like she had been through a war zone. She had a deep black eye, a cut lip, two deep cuts across her nose, and blood all over her shirt. Her baseball cap had blood splatter on it. 

“I’m Noah, and I’m sorry, but we don’t have time to talk. The principal has been making his rounds, and we finally got a good opportunity to move. We have to take it.” Noah said as he handed me my bags. I slid one up my unused arm and took the other with my hand. It wasn’t perfect, but it would have to do. 

“Are you a cop?” I asked Noah; he had a badge on his hip. His white long-sleeved shirt was caked in blood, as were his hat and boots. 

“Privet investigator.” Noah answered before turning towards the door. 

“Luke, Tiffany, are you guys ready?” Noah asked the duo. 

“Ready,” Luke said and Noah gave them a solid nod. 

\-

As soon as the door opened, we ran into the hallway; I will forever be grateful to Emily for helping me move. Noah led the charge, and we ran towards the stairs, but as we started going down them, the whistling started back up again. 

The moment Noah hit the first floor, we could hear somebody laughing at us. Once the whole group got on the ground floor, I tried to look around for the laughing. By the time I saw him, it was too late; a baseball flew past my shoulder and slammed into Tiffany's head with enough force to shatter her skull. I broke into screams; I had never seen anything like that before. Blood flew all over us; my face was soaked. Tiffany's body hit the floor with a loud thud and Luke cried out for his friend. 

“It’s locked! We have to go another way!” Noah screamed to us and turned to take off running to the cafeteria. Emily moved quickly to follow him; I could hear her begging Luke to follow us. He tried to say that Tiffiny was still moving, but he gave in when he was nearly hit by a baseball. 

Noah forced the cafeteria doors open. As we ran inside the room, a loud crash came from behind us. Emily spun quickly, just in time to watch as the man in the black suit took Luke by his arm. He came through those damn doors like it was nothing. 

Luke screamed and kicked his legs; now that I could see the man in the black suit fully he was huge. I could some shooting behind me and I watched the bullets hit the man, and promptly hit the floor around his feet. 

“Run!” Noah screamed to Emily.

She turned and forced me to follow; I couldn’t believe that we were leaving him behind. I turned my head to check over my shoulder. I watched as Luke screamed as his arm was ripped from his body like it was nothing like his skin and bones were made out of paper. The man dropped him and slammed his foot into Luke’s head. I eventually had to turn away as I heard his foot finally penetrate his skull. I will never forget that noise. 

As we reached the back of the cafeteria, Noah slammed his shoulder into a back exit. It eventually opened for us. I gasped; we were looking at a bloody football field. It never occurred to me that things could’ve happened outside of the school building, but still on school grounds. 

Emily pulled me forward and as we made our way around the building, a pain shot up my leg, I cried out and buckled. I looked at the ground and watched a baseball roll past my legs. The pain was intense, but I wasn’t bleeding. If he had a clear shot, why didn’t he kill me? 

“Do you have a car?” Emily asked me as we finally made it around the building. “Yes, and I left the keys inside!” I gasped as she pulled me along. The pain was…intense. 

“I will get my jeep and follow!” Noah said as he kept running. He must’ve parked elsewhere because his car wasn’t in the parking lot. 

As Emily helped me to the passenger seat and I tossed the bags in the back, a lot of thoughts were running through my head. Something was different, something was wrong, worse than before. But at least I finally had the potential to find some [answers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpectralsMegaverse/comments/1adv727/story_directory_and_more/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
