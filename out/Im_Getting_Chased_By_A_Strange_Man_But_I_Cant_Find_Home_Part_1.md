I would properly introduce myself but it feels like I don't really have the time to do so right now so I'll just start. I got off from work not too long ago, just about thirty minutes ago when I noticed there was a man just behind me. I couldn't make out most of his features, all I could make out was wearing a tuxedo and a fedora that covered his face.  Now at first I wasn't too concerned, maybe a little uneasy as it was 9pm and it was practically pitch black because some of  the streetlights weren't working tonight but overall I felt nothing. That was until I moved a little bit towards the right to let an on coming biker pass by me and I noticed as I looked back towards the biker that the man mirrored my movements almost perfectly, he shifted just towards the right just as I did and was even looking behind him just as I was doing in that moment. Even weirder is the fact that the biker vanished completely, only leaving behind a slight trail left by one his tires.

This immediately creeped me out as I let out an audible "Nope" as I started to pick up my walking speed. I didn't even bother to look behind me until I heard the sound of what I thought were the pitter patter of shoes quickly and firmly hitting the pavement; The man had started to pick his pace as well, only I realized he stopped walking like a normal person. Instead, he crept around on all fours and impossibly bent his arms and legs to make an arch like a spider. In between steps I could hear a panting coming from the man, like that of an excited dog. I felt my heart skip a beat and took my first step in what would've been the biggest sprint of my life when I realized something; If it was mimicking ALL of my movements, wouldn't it mimic my sprint as well?

 Would it become faster than me and overtake me? Still, I felt the need to run away. I wasn't exactly confident it wouldn't just overtake me in terms of speed but I still need to retreat back home and luckily, I noticed something familiar; A local donut shop that resided just around the corner of my neighborhood. I let out a sigh of relief, still checking the crawling man in my peripheral vision every few second. At this point I grew more and more impatient, I could see houses from my neighborhood clearly and I knew that my house wasn't too far. At this point I didn't care anymore, my impatience got the better off and I started sprinting towards house.

I tried to avoid looking behind me as I ran but I noticed the lack of footsteps coming from behind me, so I looked behind me to see where the man was. Instead of seeing nothing or the man just behind me, I was met with airborne shoes dangling right in front of my face. I looked up further, finally getting a good look at the man's face. I can't even begin to describe how it looked, it was just so crooked. It was like nothing on his face complimented each other at all; It felt like he was imitating how a human face should look. His smile was too big for his lips, his ears were too small for his head, his jaw too big for his teeth. He looked down upon me and smiled showing his tiny yet sharp teeth while I heard the same panting noise come from his mouth. He was completely airborne, floating in a position I can only describe as a crucifixion pose. His arms hanging in the air parallel to each other as he came closer to me.

Seeing this I immediately picked up the pace, scared for my life at the hands of whatever this thing was. I recognized my next door neighbors house and I started to get excited as I realized I was finally just about home. I ran past his house with excitement, getting my keys out of my pocket and shuffled through them until I found my house key. I didn't even look up or behind me as I did this, I was just ready to be home and call the cops or maybe an exorcist as I put the key into my doorknob and twisted. My excitement immediately came to an end when I realized that the door wasn't opening and the doorknob resisted against my key. Shocked and confused I observed the key but I knew it was definitely my house key. "Isn't this my house? Why isn't the door opening?" I thought to myself. I tried once again but again the door wouldn't open.

I looked to my right to observe the other houses around to see if this truly was my neighborhood and I saw my next door neighbor's car parked in his driveway confirming that this was my neighborhood. "Then, why isn't the door opening?" I thought as I looked up and realized who's door to their house I was trying to unlock. It wasn't my house for sure. I wasn't even completely sure who's house this was. Whomever  this house belongs to, it's where my house is supposed to be.
 
"No no no," I said under my breath in shock and slammed my fist into the door. I was in my neighborhood but this wasn't my house, before I could gather my thoughts I heard a familiar panting coming from just behind me. The Man With The Fedora floated in the air just behind me still grinning and showing off his tiny rows of teeth. He hasn't moved towards me at all, he hasn't reached out to me despite him definitely being able to in the position he was in right now. I don't know what to do which is why I'm typing this right now, it's been what feels like hours and I'm too scared to move and I refuse to take my eyes off him. I'm holding my phone in such a way where I can just barely see him while I typing and he still hasn't moved at all or gotten any less creepy. Please if anyone can help me please send the authorities to [redacted by the WRCC]. If I disappear and am not found please send this story to the authorities to help them get started on a case. If this is the last update I male, thank you all for reading. Goodbye.
