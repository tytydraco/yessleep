My childhood home had a cellar that no one in my family would go into, and for good reason. It was always cold down there, even in summer, and every time I even got close to the door, I’d get chills. My mother told me the cellar was haunted by the spirit of the home’s original owner, a man named Frederick Kline, who had disappeared under mysterious circumstances in 1937. My father would dismiss it as "silly stories," but he wouldn’t go near the cellar either.

When I was ten, my curiosity got the better of me. I snuck down one night with a flashlight and my heart hammering in my chest. I reached the bottom, and the smell was overwhelming—a damp, rotten stench that didn’t match anything we stored down there. The moment I shone my flashlight on the far wall, my stomach twisted. Scrawled across the stone in faded, jagged letters were the words: GET OUT.

I ran upstairs, too scared to mention it to anyone. I didn’t go down there again until I was twenty-four, after both my parents had passed and I inherited the house. Out of necessity, I started clearing out the old rooms and spaces, hoping to finally understand what lurked in the cellar.

The first few days, I only moved things around upstairs. It was as if the cellar itself was daring me to come closer, like it was waiting for something, or someone, to finally break the silence. At night, I’d hear sounds—muffled whispering, faint scraping, sometimes even a low, deep groan.

On the fifth day, I mustered the courage to go down there with a box of cleaning supplies and an iron poker. As soon as I stepped inside, the air felt thick, almost suffocating. My flashlight flickered, casting weak light onto the same words on the wall, which somehow looked even fresher than I remembered. It was almost as if they had been redrawn.

And then I saw him.

In the dim light, the figure was unmistakable: a tall, shadowy form huddled in the corner, with a face that barely held human resemblance. His eyes were sunken, glistening in the darkness, and his mouth twisted into a terrible, crooked smile.

I froze, unable to move or scream. He looked right at me, as if he’d been waiting all along. I could hear a faint whisper coming from him, saying, "Welcome back...I’ve been so very lonely." Then, suddenly, he lunged forward, closing the distance in seconds. I stumbled backward, tripping over an old wine rack, but somehow managed to scramble up the stairs.

I locked the door, barricading it with whatever I could find. I barely slept that night, but every time I closed my eyes, I saw that face.

After that, I put the house up for sale, but I couldn’t leave. It was like the cellar wouldn’t let me go. I started finding things around the house moved, the cellar door unlocked, and every night, a faint whisper would echo through the house: "Why did you leave me?"

I don’t know who—or what—I saw that night. But one thing I do know: something waits in the dark corners of the world, longing for company. And if you’re not careful, you might find yourself in the same position as me, haunted by something that will never, ever let you go.
