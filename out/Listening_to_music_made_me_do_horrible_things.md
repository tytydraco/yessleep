Okay, so I must warn you that you probably shouldn’t go looking for this artist on SoundCloud but also not revealing their name could lead you into a trap. So hear me out and don’t listen to HypnoBaSS.

If you are someone like me, which is already unlikely, and listen to electronic music casually, you know SoundCloud and moreover, probably enjoy listening to DJ sets. I do that because very often Spotify just doesn’t offer good artists and sometimes just the mixing between tracks, even if they are the same, can result in a different experience every time. So, I often listen to music podcasts or dj sets like UKF because I love those bass drops.

Yet I’m very often looking for different artists or sets to get new music experiences. That’s when I stumbled upon HypnoBaSS. They had some lengthy house and dubstep tracks that’s just my liking, so I decided to try it out.

I work in HR and was doing a workers last paycheck which is a pain in the ass, so I decided it was the best way to make up for my brain by feeding it some of the bass it adores. The 2:30:00 track started with a song by “Let’s be friends” followed by “Habstrakt” so I knew I was in for a great start. 

At around the 40 minute mark, a song I never heard started and I checked to see that it was an original by the artist called AXEM. It started pretty good too and after the first section the second one started with a long and heavy build up to a drop (in case you are not familiar with electronic music a drop is the part of the song where there is a sudden change of rhythm), so deep, profound and insane that I was expecting to have my brain melt when it finally happened. 

But as the first beat of the drop hit my ears, I blinked my eyes to find myself in silence and nowhere I’ve ever seen before. In panic I looked around and found it was night and I was inside a car that wasn’t mine in front of a storage shed I’ve never seen before. I searched for my phone in my pockets but didn’t find it. I had a feeling that I wasn’t inside my own body, like my soul had moved places, but thankfully as I looked in the rearview mirror I was still me.

I the turned the key halfway on the car to see the dashboard telling me it was 10:15PM. 12 hours had passed since I had any recollection of what I was doing. As I moved my hand from the car key I noticed I had dirt under my nails and scratches in my hands. 

I jumped out of the car and saw it had hit something on the side, by the drivers door. Did I do it? I approached the side of the car and noticed some small red spots in the door handle. And in my shirt, which, also, wasn’t the shirt I was wearing when I was working. My white shoes were also covered in mud and cut grass. What the hell was I doing?

I opened the door to the backseat of the car and sat there to try to piece it all together when a reflection hit my eyes. My phone. It was out of battery but the back glass reflected the light of a nearby lamp post. Outside was barely lit but there was no one nearby, the street was probably in one of those industrial areas where companies stock stuff. Most sheds were unmarked but there was one down the road with the name of a supermarket and another was a car repair shop.

Anyway, there was a charger in the front seat of the car, attached to the cigarette lighter so I hopped back to the front seat to plug it in and wait to see if I could find any answer.

As id have to turn the car key to charge the phone, I might as well check if the car works and it did, and it had some fuel as well, so I sat there with the air conditioning blowing on my face pondering if I should try to go out of the car and look for someone as well. There was only another car parked about 200m of where I was in the entire street. Might as well check the phone first.

A few minutes later, the screen lit up and I swiped to unlock the phone. It was even lagging with so many notifications. I checked some of them but I wasn’t going to answer anyone before I arrived home.

“Jackson, are you coming back to work? You left for lunch early but I haven’t seen you since. Is everything okay?” My boss, which was actually very kind and probably worried.

“Why are you ghosting me? I see you online, why don’t you answer me?” My absence sparked a different reaction on my girlfriend.

Other than that my mom complained about not checking with her today, something she insists I do and a strange text from an unknown number saying “thank you”. This is the only conversation I opened but there was only this message.

I decided getting home was a priority. So I opened my gps to find I was TWO CITIES away from my home town. What the hell was I doing here!

I instantly started driving towards home but as I crossed that other car on the road, I could see someone staring at the steering wheel, but I dared not interact with them. The amount of NOPE for this day was already off the charts.

When I arrived home two hours later, I was no close to understanding what happened during the previous 12 hours of my day. I simply ignored everything I received during the day on my phone. My only clue was the thank you message, but I tried messaging back and got no answer and calling the number prompted me with a disconnected line message.

I abandoned the car I was in about a mile away from home in a dark corner because if the red spots I was seeing were blood and it was from someone who owned that car… no, I can’t believe that even in that state I would have killed anyone. Right? I wouldn’t. I sure wouldn’t. But i wasn’t in for the risk.

At home I apologized to everyone who messaged me saying I felt bad and went home and slept. What else could I say? I still couldn’t wrap my mind around this extremely weird day. I dumped my clothes and even my sneakers. Promised my girlfriend Allie I’d see her the next day after the gym and she seemed to only half forgive me, but I think she maybe was worried I was cheating on her. She is very jealous.

Next morning, I went to work by uber and as I arrived I talked to my boss trying to get help from her, of all people.

“Listen Natalie.. I understand what I’m about to ask you is really weird, but can I take a look on yesterday’s footage of the office’s cameras?” I asked.

“What the hell, Jack? Are you serious?” She inquired.

“Yeah… I know this is super strange but you know me for 5 years and I trust you. I have no idea what happened yesterday after I left” I confessed

“I… you… okay, if you say so.” She amused me by checking the cameras.

I left the building on foot, marching with purpose but with dead eyes looking straight until I was off the camera. 

“Jack, be honest. Were you on drugs? It’s ok if you were just trying but this isn’t you. I’ll not hold it against you, just tell me the truth”. Her question was warranted. It sure seemed like I was a zombie.

“Swear to god I wasn’t. I was working and then, I don’t remember anything else.” I said pondering that instead of thinking I was a drug addict now she would think I’m crazy. “Nathalie, please, can we keep this between us until I figure this out?”

“Sure, but ‘our company is a family’ bullshit aside, you are one of my oldest employees and I’d like to think we are friends. So if anything comes up, talk to me”

“Thank you, I promise I will”. 5 years knowing her and still she was probably my “oldest” “friend”. I was dating Allie for only 4 months.

My work day felt strange. Instead of music, I tuned to the local radio because as far as evidenced by what I saw I could have robbed a car and ran it over someone. I was already feeling guilty when the news reporter started talking about the car I ditched and was now found. 

“The white Subaru was found still in flames. The owner, Mr. Edward, 67 claims he parked the car close to his house when he last saw it. The absence of local cameras makes it difficult to identify the criminal, but having found the car in flames rises the suspicion of foul play. No evidence could be collected from the now destroyed vehicle.”

The relief that Mr. Edward was still alive and there was nothing connecting the event to me, almost helped me forget for a bit that someone set that car on fire and it wasn’t me.

I pushed myself to try to brush it off and resume my normal boring life. Whatever caused me to do what I did wouldn’t probably be traced to me and I was not under any control. 

“Hey, can I trust you to be a normal person and go home today?” Natalie startled me. It was already 5PM.

“Sure” I giggled somewhat nervously. 

“Please check in. You have my personal number.”

“Sure, but I want to go to the gym first to clear my head, so when I’m off to see Allie I’ll text you ok?”

So I went to the gym and tried to workout as usual. Have a normal day. I texted Allie during my training so she knew it was all ok. And I chose Spotify this time.

The hormones made me feel way better. Even the song suggestions were fine, and I allowed myself to feel okay for the night. I just needed a quick break from that confusion, I would think about it better next morning. 

Somehow the booming bass was relaxing. I was curling a weight and got curious about this nice song that was building up. As I raised my phone to check the song name I started to scream “OH F” but the “UCK” only came out several hours later, in a room decorated like a hotel with me standing bare feet on a pool of blood.

I was listening to “HypnoBaSS - Rivers of Blood” sometime in the past.
