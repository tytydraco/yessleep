My Uncle Ron had always been a quiet, anxious man. When I was a child under his care, I was honestly quite intimidated by his mannerisms and heightened awareness. 

**Why you may ask? Well, because he was blind.**

It wasn't just that he couldn't see, it was in the way he had carried himself. I thought he could feel the world in ways no one else could. He always seemed to know when I was nearby, even if I tried my hardest to sneak up on him. 

He'd tilt his head toward me and smile, his pale eyes locking onto mine like he was staring directly into my soul. *"Always stay close,"* he'd tell me. *"And know.. that I'll always be by your side, even if I'm gone."* 

At the time, I genuinely thought it was comforting, even sweet - a way to make me feel secure, even in the face of his inevitable passing.

**However, I always felt that there was something he wasn't telling me.**

As I grew older, I noticed how much Uncle Ron had began to struggle. His blindness wasn't the calm acceptance I had assumed as a child; but it was a raging storm of fears and anxieties inside him. He'd often panic - episodes where he'd clutch at the walls or his chest, gasping for air. He would mutter to himself, pacing around as if trying to find his way out of something only he could see and feel. 

He never told me anything about what was going on with him, but I found that *he would often confide in Aunt Lily.* 

One such night, I was awoken by a loud crash. It was thud followed by a sharp sound of something heavy hitting the floor. I heard paced footsteps descend the staircase. And so I followed.

It came from the living room downstairs, near the mantelpiece. I rushed to see uncle sprawled on the floor, disoriented. The couch where he usually sat at that hour, was close by. His head was turned at an unnatural angle, his pale eyes wide open though lifeless. His walking stick was flung afar, across the room by the dining table.

My aunt was kneeling beside him, holding his trembling hand and whispering softly. She comforted him, *"It's alright Ron. It's alright.. you're here. You're safe now."*

He whimpered, his face twisting in pain. His voice, coarse and desperate, gasped, *"Oh... dear, I shouldn't have.. I shouldn't have killed --"*

Aunt Lily's head snapped up, her eyes meeting mine in the dim glow of the lamp. Panic flooded her face. *"Please.. Please.. help him."* she cried, her voice cracking. *"He's not well.. Get the water!"*

The scene was unnervingly calm yet frantic at the same time. My hands trembled as I fetched the water into a glass from the kitchen sink, my mind racing with questions.

I was shaking with unexplained nervousness as I brought the glass of water to Aunt Lily. She coaxed Uncle Ron to sip on it, her voice trembling, her eyes exchanging nervous glances with me. 

He didn't say another word that night, and retired to bed with Aunty. I stood dumbstruck in the pitch darkness, revaluating the scene I had just witnessed.

It was more of a ritual of his, you know. I really didn't understand how he got down the stairs to sit on his couch in the living room so deep into the mid-night. He'd often sit by himself in the dim glow of the lamp, ruminating on thoughts *I could only help but imagine.*

**This time it had felt different.** The crash, the way his walking stick had been flung so far - it was as if something had struck him down. 

I couldn't catch much sleep that night, and as I woke up early in the morning, I tried asking Aunt Lily about what Uncle had said the previous night. She was unusually quiet, her face pale and hands shaking as she folded the laundry. When I finally worked up the nerve to ask her, *"What did Uncle mean last night? About.. killing.. someone?"* her movements froze.

I anticipated an answer as her lips parted. Her eyes darted toward the window as if she was searching for words somewhere out there. Instead, she just sighed my question off, mumbling something about how his *"illness"* was making him ramble. *"Don't take it to heart, dear."*

**I couldn't let it go.** 

Uncle Ron's health began to deteriorate rapidly after the next few nights. His panic attacks grew worse, and he barely left his room during the day. Yet, in the dead of the night, I would still hear the faint creak of his footsteps on the stairs, and the distant groan of the couch as he settled into his usual spot in the living room. 

**I never dared to go down again. Not after that night.**

His promises grew more frequent. Every time I helped him with something as he lay ill, he'd try to express his gratitude. How I had been such a help to him, and how he would never forget what I was doing for him. It grew erratically frequent, even for the slightest, silliest of things - fetching him his medicine, adjusting his pillows. He'd repeat, *"I'd always be.. always be by your side."*

I brushed it off as his way of accepting his inevitable death, and expressing his gratitude for what I did for him. 

His final days were quiet, almost eerily so. Aunt Lily barely spoke to me, and when she did - it was very short and curt. She spent most of her time by his bed, holding his hand, her eyes red from crying.

When the end came, it was sudden. I had stepped out to fetch some groceries, and by the time I returned, Aunt Lily was already on the phone. Her voice was trembling as she spoke in short, hurried sentences. I could see her face through the living room window before I even stepped inside. 

A pallor to her face. Her eyes hollow, as though something inside her had shattered.

**Uncle Ron was gone.**

I found him lying on the bed, unnervingly still, his pale eyes open, staring, arm twisted and finger pointing to the wall. His face was cold, and calm, but had a slight sense of fright to it, *as if his blind eyes had caught an apparition*. I wondered if his death had been a relief for him, to escape whatever tormented him in life, and cleanse all the remorse he had left with.

*His promise hit different that day. I knew he was somewhere near.*

The funeral was somber, as expected - but it felt wrong in ways I'd rather not articulate. Friends and his distant relatives gathered, sharing warm memories of Uncle Ron, talking about his resilience, his kind spirit. I tried to smile, to nod along - yet I felt like an indifferent outsider among the mourners.

At one point, the emotions caught up to me. I stepped away from the close gathering, trying to catch a breath. My chest tightened, and before I could stop it - tears rolled down my face. I sank onto a bench, wiping my eyes with my trembling hands.

When I finally looked up at the distant gathering, composing myself, **I saw someone.**

A **man**, standing still near the edge of the crowd. He looked too young to have been one of Uncle Ron's friends, maybe in his mid forties. His blond hair was combed neat, gleaming in the sunlight. His eyes were sharp blue, almost stark in their intensity and his light eyebrows slightly frowned.

He wasn't crying. He wasn't even somber.

**He was grinning.** It wasn't a warm, comforting smile - **it felt sinister.** I could say it was charming, but there was an edge to it, like *he knew something I didn't.* 

**I felt drawn to him.**

I stared at him for a few moments, silently pausing my sobs. It was a strange contrast, and I was too overwhelmed to try and approach him. I didn't feel like talking to any stranger, and I'm sure Uncle Ron had many friends he hadn't introduced me to or talked about. Maybe he was someone who knew him.

I just wiped my eyes, took a deep breath, and turned my gaze away from him. **I lost him in the crowd soon, or maybe he just left.**  

I shook my head, chalking it up to the emotions overwhelming me. It was a strange mixture of grief, exhaustion and a little too much time alone in my own thoughts.

The days after the funeral were **oppressively quiet**. The house, once filled with his mutterings, the rhythmic knock of his walking stick, and the faint shuffle of his footsteps, felt lifeless now. His uncanny absence made the silence deafening.

I found myself *struggling to sleep.* The nights felt heavier, like the air pressed down on my chest. Shadows lingered too long in the corners of my room, and the faint creaks of the house settling felt too deliberate. 

**Aunt Lily was faring worse.**

She avoided eye contact whenever we passed each other, and what little communication we had before had dwindled to nothing. We only spoke when something was urgent or unavoidable, her voice barely more than a whisper.

I often heard her pacing in her room late at night. Occasionally, I caught the faint sound of her climbing the stairs to my room. *She would stop just outside the door, lingering there anxiously, as if torn between stepping in and retreating.* 

**Then, one night, she came rushing upstairs to my room.** 

I woke to the sound of her hurried footsteps. She didn't knock, just burst in, her face pale as the dim light spilled through the window. She was shaking, her hands clutching the doorknob so tightly her knuckles were white.

*"Can.. Can I stay here tonight?"* she stammered, her voice shaking.

I blinked at her, still groggy, but the look on her face jolted me awake. I nodded, pulling the blanket aside as she dove into bed, curling up like a child seeking comfort. I didn't ask her what had happened, not right away. She seemed too shaken to talk, her eyes darting in the darkness. 

As she caught her breath, her voice broke the tension.

***"I saw him.****"* she said, softly.

*"Who?"*

*“Ron,”* she croaked, her voice cracking. *“He was sitting on the edge of my bed... trying to wake me up. He—he looked... so troubled, so wrong.”* She shuddered, pulling the blanket tighter around herself. "*I heard him sobbing, whining as he rebuked himself. His voice... it was so hoarse, so strangled like he was suffocating on his own pain. His blind eyes - ... they were.. they were wide open, he saw me.* ***He saw me!*** *His face was so full of terror!"* 

She trembled, pressing herself closer. *"I couldn't help it.. I had to.. I had to leave. It felt so wrong! Oh, forgive me, Lord!"*

She cried.. and cried.. and cried herself to sleep. **I couldn't get any.** The uneasy fear dried my throat. I tried to convince myself to not be scared. After all, he was my Uncle. I had knew him since I was a child. 

**What was there to be afraid of?**

After what felt like hours in my thoughts of evaluating my unnecessary fears - I finally mustered up the courage to get myself a glass of water from the kitchen downstairs. It was pitch dark. We had shut all the lights before us as we went to bed. The only light I could see was that reflected off the dim lamp by the couch in the living room.

I descended down the stairs, and went across the dark hallway. The glow of the lamp in the living room guided me to the kitchen. As I crossed the couch, **I couldn't shake the uneasy feeling of being watched, like eyes on my back.**

I took a deep breath and hurried to the kitchen, my legs trembling. The water tasted cold and bitter, and it did absolutely nothing to ease the tightness in my chest. *At least it quenched my thirst.* The house was too quiet, and there was an uneasy stillness to the air.

**Then, I heard it - a faint, uneven yet familiar knock**. The sound of Uncle Ron's walking stick tapping on the floor, just beyond the kitchen door. I froze, almost choking on the water down my throat. 

*The knocking came again, slower now.* Rhythmic. Like someone was testing the air and measuring my fear.

Suddenly, the lamp in the living room *flickered and died*, plunging everything into darkness. I was blinded, and could make of nothing in the darkness. I could see the couch in the living room, and my eyes, fixed on it as if ***expecting to see something*** \- ***now started to make out a faint silhouette that seemed to grow darker.***

**It was Uncle Ron.**

*His head hung low, hands folded in his lap. His presence was almost unnerving, still and utterly eerie. He slowly looked up towards me, as if acknowledging my presence.* 

In the blink of an eye, I flicked the light of the kitchen on, expecting to make the apparition disappear. 

I froze once again. And soon, the kitchen light had flickered and died too.

**I ran.** My feet pounded the stairs as the thuds of something chasing me rang in my ears, heavy, relentless in footing. At one moment I felt someone tug at my collar, trying to pull me back. I rushed into my room and slipped into bed, the covers pulled over me as I tried to keep my breath steady.

But sleep wouldn't come. Not at all.

**Not tonight.**

The next morning, me and Aunt Lily had finally come to agree on something after years. It was clear to both of us after the previous night that something kept Uncle from leaving "our side". He was a tormented spirit now, restless to be liberated from whatever was binding him to us.

The house felt like a tomb, his lingering presence - an unspoken weight between us.

**That afternoon, we decided that we would pack up Uncle Ron's belongings. It was time they left the home.** 

The boxes sat empty in the living room as I began to go through his things. Each item felt like it had been tainted by whatever lingered in his life - but I pressed on, careful and steady. As I moved through the clutter of papers, old clothes and what not - I felt an overwhelming loss and dread, as though I were digging through a life that had never been truly free.

**That's when I found it.**

Tucked away in the back of his drawer, beneath a few faded letters nobody read to him, ***was a small, ornate amulet of gold*** \- *now thinner than a coin, worn off along its edges.* It had grown dark and weathered, its chain lost but surface smooth and oddly warm to the touch. I turned it over in my hand, feeling an inexplicable pull, a cold unease washing over me. 

Indeed, there was something wrong about it, something *ancient and malignant*. On it was etched an all-seeing eye enclosed in the beautiful carved borders on the circular rim. *I could feel my eyes slightly burn and feel heavy the longer I stared into it.* 

I called Aunt Lily over, my voice unsteady as I held it out to her. Her face turned ashen when she saw it, her eyes wide with a mixture of fear and recognition. *"You... you shouldn't have touched it,"* she whispered, her voice trembling. *"Put.. Put it down!"*

I watched her, confused. *"What is this? What's going on, Aunt Lily?"*

She didn't answer immediately. She just stared at the amulet, her face hardening with the weight of a painful memory. ***After a long pause, she sighed deeply, looking away, as if she couldn't .. or shouldn't have avoided it any longer.***

*"It's time... It's time I told you something. You were too young to understand."* she said quietly, her voice strained. ***"As he told me, when Ron... was in college, he... he did something terrible."***

She began, *"He was approached by someone.. a man - who said could give him.. a gift. A gift that would snatch away his fears."*

I listened intently, unable to speak. Aunt Lily's hands were shaking as she gently took the amulet from mine. Moving it about her fingers, she continued, *"He.. as I remember.. was caught by a cult. They told him they could give him sight - sight beyond this world. They told him he could see things that no one else could see.. that he'd be able to see beyond death, and before birth."*

***"But only.. if he made a sacrifice. His vision, and a life, for an eternity - of foresight."***

My heart pounded in my chest, but I remained silent.

*"They told him.. he must.. he must kill someone, someone innocent. An animal, a person.. it could be anything. He would have to warm the amulet, rub it in the spilled blood, and then.. hot into his eyes. He would then .. be forever bound to this world, forever alive, forever watching. Whether in skin, or spirit. After this exchange, they left him with the amulet.. making nothing else of him but a great fool - whose decisions were those that would rid his fears.* ***The amulet, as he called it, was the Amulet of Foresight.****"*

She paused, breaking down.

*"... He did it. He did the terrible. He never told me who or what he killed.. but I know he had lost his dog.. his pet.. quiet early. I don't want to think... I don't want to think at all. But you must know. Every single day.. for him, in his foolishness - was a day he wished would soon be over. He knew he could never leave.. he knew he could never be free. He knew..."* she stopped, collecting herself. *"...Listen. I know he is here. Listening to us speak.. you know he needs us.. he needs us to set him free.."*

I nodded, equally horrified and shocked at what I heard, not believing anything she said.

***"I know... this sounds dramatic.. but you need to believe me.. this amulet - it still keeps him here. Tied to us.. tied to this world. We need to get rid of it."***

I whispered, *"I don't.. I don't know how to destroy it.. We can't just.. just throw it away? Right?"* 

***"Melt it down. Burn it up... dismantle it.. do something!"*** she cried. ***"Set him free. Please.. oh, please!"***

I decided to acknowledge what she said. She knew of this matter better than I could ever discern of. Without another word, I stormed to the garage, my hands trembling with rage. All those years of fear, of Uncle Ron's torment - of Aunt Lily's suffering - because of this "cursed" thing. If it gave him a release, I would return the favor to this artifact.

I grabbed a hammer that sat on a shelf and battered the amulet with all the strength I could summon. The first rang through like a loud clap, and the second splintered the weak metal open. With each following blow, I reduced it to pieces and pieces, as Aunt Lily watched it finally break down with sudden satisfaction.

***"Stoke the fire in the fireplace! It must burn!"*** I commanded. As I hammered it down to the last bits, Aunt Lily lit the fire, and soon it was ready to swallow it whole.

I clutched the shards and pieces of the cursed metal, my hand gripping them intensely. I approached the fireplace and flung the cracked remains of the amulet into the flames.

*But then, I saw the box... the box of Uncle's belongings begin to burn away, the fire slowly growing.* Soon, it was fully alight, and as the amulet burned, so did his belongings. I was quick enough to kick away the box all the way gradually into the garden and put off the fire before it spread to the house. 

**As soon as it died, I knew it was done.**

We threw away the charred wood and metal into a trash bag and soon cast it away into the local dumpster.

There was an uneasy calm to the house as Aunt Lily sat on a sofa by the couch in silence, composing herself, waiting for my arrival.

She said out loud, *"I hope... I hope you're free. I hope you're free, Ron. I hope..."* convincing herself, trying to believe whatever we did would rid him of his torment.

Following that evening, the nights returned to their peaceful state. The creaks and whispers that had haunted our halls faded away, replaced by the ordinary sounds of a home at rest. 

Aunt Lily gradually found her smile again, and I found myself remembering Uncle Ron not as the tormented soul he became, but as the caring man who had watched over me in my childhood.

Wherever he is now, I hope he's found the peace that eluded him in life, free from the burden of his choices. 

***Rest in peace, Uncle Ron - this time, truly at rest.***
