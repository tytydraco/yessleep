I was worried about my sister. Eliza had become withdrawn and had stopped responding to any sort of invitations to visit. The last time I had spoken to her, the only words she’d uttered were to ask me “Have you heard of the Cult of Dawn?” I had not and was confused by the question. Eliza and I hadn’t been close in a few years but something about the desperation in her voice pulled at me and I made up my mind to visit her home. 

It was just after 12 when I made it to her address. The summer day was at its hottest and a cool breeze ruffled my hair. I stood at the foot of her modest 2 story home. The cement steps were covered in dry moss and discolored yellow dust. Her whole house seemed faded and looked empty as if no one had gone in or out in weeks. My trepidation grew as I neared the splintered wooden door. There was an undercurrent of something that I couldn’t quite put my finger on but I didn’t like it. Something was wrong. I pushed the door open and stepped inside. 

The air was stale and it was clear that it there hadn’t been any circulation in a while. I called out “Eliza! It’s Anna, are you home?” I heard a weak grunt come from above me to my left, somewhere near her bedroom. I let out a relieved exhale. Eliza was alive and she was home. Whatever was going on I could handle now, knowing that my worst thoughts had been just that.

I headed towards the stairs that would lead me to the upper level of her home. As I walked, I looked around. There was a layer of dust covering the frames of the windows and on the doorways and a discoloration that seemed to permeate the very air. I still couldn’t quite put a finger to what it was. Maybe when I saw Eliza she’d be able to tell me what had happened. I headed to her bedroom and called out “Eliza?” She answered weakly, “I’m here.” I opened the door and crossed the threshold. 

The room had a yellow glow to it almost like the sun right before it decided to completely wake and turn into day. My sister was huddled on a pile of clothes to my right. Her normally shiny dark waves hung in stringy limp pieces around her. Her face was haunt and her eyes sallow. From the pile she was curled up on emanated a sickly sweet smell, like fruit that had been left out too long. It mixed with the scent of sweat and my stomach heaved. Eliza looked severely emaciated. I walked towards her and unease gnawed at my stomach as I passed the bed. I came to the pile of clothing and knelt down. 

“Eliza” I asked “what happened?” She turned away and said “take care of Jona.” “Jona?” I asked, my eyebrows creased in confusion. “Jona” she mumbled and looked to her left. I followed her gaze and from under the bed a curly head of golden hair with blue eyes peered out. “Jona!” I squealed and held my arms out. He smiled and then shyly made his was into my embrace. The 2 year old was quiet but he looked healthier than my sister did. I looked back over at her and she said “I’ve been very weak and haven’t been able to take care of him.” I frowned. “We need to get you out of here” I said, “to the hospital. Whatever’s happened to you, you’re skin and bones and I’m worried.” “It’s too late” Eliza replied. “What do you mean?” I asked. She looked past me and over my shoulder. I followed her gaze again. “What do you see out the window?” She questioned. 

I paused, and then looked at the window. It was an odd one for a bedroom. Narrow and long, sitting high along the wall. Too high to actually see anything beyond the sky, but my eyes immediately gravitated towards the sky. The sky was a strange shade of orange-yellow. Like a slash of an infected wound oozing with pus. That’s why the room was lit up in the strange way I’d first noticed. “The sky looks strange” I muttered, unease creeping up my spine. Eliza sighed and said “the Cult of Dawn.” I looked down at her and frowned, “Eliza you’re not making any sense. I’m going to pack some things for you and Jona and I’m taking you to the hospital.” 

I found a duffel and started packing clothing into it. Jona held onto me and I tried smiling at him. He smiled back. I wondered how long it had been since he’d last been fed. Eliza didn’t look like she’d gotten off that pile for a while. I carried Jona into the kitchen. Despite everything he looked happy and he squealed when I set him in the floor. I started scavenging the kitchen cabinets for something to feed him when I heard the slapping of his feet against the linoleum. I looked up to see him disappearing back towards the bedroom. Having found the cupboards empty I sighed and headed back. As I got closer to the entry I started to hear crying. 

Jona! I rushed into the room and heard some muffled “helps” coming from under the bed. I knelt down and my stomach dropped in horror. Jona was being dragged in by his leg by an emptiness, thick like tar and darker than a moonless night. I started pulling him back “no” “no” “no” I screamed. “Let go!” I pulled at Jona out and surprisingly the void let him go. I gathered him into my arms and pressed him against my breast. He cried against my body. As I pulled away from the bed I saw tendrils, like black smoke oozing out from under it. My tongue grew thick and heavy in my mouth. I pressed Jona closer to me and stumbled back. I had to get away and out of this room. Out of this sickly yellow house. Out and away. I pushed my way through the door and made my way down the stairs. As I rounded the bottom I heard a voice like metal scraping against metal right behind me. “Mine” it ground out and I felt hot stinging breath against my neck. I pumped my legs faster and slammed open the door out the house. My stomach dropped again. 

Everywhere I looked there was a sickly cast like a luminescent shadow- the street, the looming trees, and the windows of the houses around me reflected it. The street was completely empty and air did not stir. The sky was dull and I couldn’t see the sun. I couldn’t feel it. I turned around in horror. In front of me was the mass and it moved slowly, stalking me. It seemed to pull the light in and twist it back reflecting shades of bile. I shuddered. This was another world and it couldn’t be reality. Whatever I had experienced in the house had to have ended there. It couldn’t be reality. I had to break free of it. With a heavy ball of dread gathering in my chest, I did the only thing I could think of that could maybe draw attention from the real world where I was supposed to be. I closed my eyes and screamed. I screamed with all the air I had in my lungs, with all the strength I could muster. 

I felt a hand on my shoulder and nearly fell forward in terror. I turned around and opened my eyes. Bright glaring sun nearly blinded me and when my eyes had accustomed to it I saw that the hand on my shoulder had been attached to a shocked dark haired man. I stepped back and looked up. The sky was blue again and I could feel the heat on me. Jonas hands were curled around my neck and his breathing had calmed. As I inhaled, I realized the man in front of me had been speaking and I looked at him again not comprehending the words he was saying. 

After that, things passed in a blur. I don’t remember much but I ended up in the hospital. At some point they pried Jona’s hands from off my neck and separated us. They continuously asked questions that I couldn’t understand or answer. All I could say was that I had to see the sun or the night but anytime the sky started to bleed orange with colors of dawn or dusk I squeezed my eyes tight and waited until I could feel the chill of the night or the heat of the sun against my skin. I don’t know how much time had passed but one day I found myself standing against the window in my hospital room. The sun was warm and comforting against my face and awareness creeped in. I opened my eyes and finally took my surroundings in. 

My room was small and clean. Sterile white and silver glared back at me. Sterile bleach emanated from all around me. My mind drifted back to how I’d ended up here. Jona and my sister. My sister! I’d abandoned her and left her with the thing. Revulsion overtook me and I collapsed. She was far gone. There was no way I could’ve saved her and Jona and myself. Still the guilt sat like lead in my stomach. At least I’d managed to get Jona away. I slowly stood up and made my way out the room. As soon as I stepped out a nurse spotted me and immediately started making her way towards me. “Anna?” She asked “Do you know where you are?”

“In a hospital,” I answered “Where is Jona? Is he alright?” “Jona?” She asked with a confused expression on her face. “Let  me get Dr. Matthews for you.” She led me back into my room and soon after a man in a white coat entered. “Dr. Matthews, is Jona alright?” I immediately asked. Dr. Matthews looked at me with a furrowed brow “Jona?” “He’s the little boy I came in with, my sister’s son, where is he? I need to see him” I questioned further. Dr. Matthews eyes glittered and he finally answered “Let me take you to him.” I followed with a furtive glance. There was something he wasn’t telling me. He took me to the elevator and pressed a button. We went down. I tried to still my stammering heart. He didn’t break the silence and neither did I. Finally we exited the elevator and he lead me through some halls. In front of a set of double doors I paused. The word “Morgue” sat above me. I glanced at Dr. Matthews with a heavy pit in my stomach. “Your sister didn’t have a son” he stated matter of fact. Horror crept in settling uncomfortably in my chest. “Let me take you to who you came in with.” I nodded, my tongue too dry to communicate with words. He opened the doors and guided me in. Ducking into a chilled sterile room off the side of another hallway, he finally stopped. 

My eyes widened as I tried to comprehend what I was seeing. On a cot lay the mummified body of a  small child. Its skin was dry like paper and crisscrossed with scars that revealed black lesions under the flesh. Sallow yellow wisps sat on its head, ends curling slightly. As I absorbed the sight, I noticed that its chest let out a small exhale. Behind me Dr. Matthews leaned in and whispered “Behold the fruition of the Cult of Dawn.”
