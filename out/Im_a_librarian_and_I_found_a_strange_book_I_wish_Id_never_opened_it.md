Row after row of books. I loved them. The smell of their pages, the ribbed spines and eloquent lettering. The cover art so beautifully hinting at the plot that lay within.  

I’d meant to become a teacher of course, perhaps even a professor one day at the community college. But the position for head librarian had opened right after I’d moved back to town and what can I say, it was destined to be.  

I spent my days sorting books on shelves, assisting patrons with locating their favorite authors, and I even got to participate in just about every event within the community. I didn’t earn a luxurious salary, but I was rich in purpose and contentment.  

*Ding…ding…ding.*  

The grandfather clock sounded in the hall. Closing time.  

I quickly scowered the library to ensure it was empty before locking the entrance doors and setting out to complete my end of day routine.  

I wiped down the front counter, sprayed Lysol on the keyboards and filled my cart with books that needed to be returned to the shelves.  

As I wheeled the cart around, I noticed a book that had been dropped on the ground. I picked it up and turned it over in my hands. It was ruby red and had nothing on the cover whatsoever. No title or author on the spine either.  

*Strange…* I thought.  

I flipped through the pages, and they were blank… at least at first. Then images begin to fill the pages as if someone were painting them from the other side of the paper.  

I cried out in surprise and dropped it on the ground.  

“What in God’s name…” I whispered before gingerly kicking it open with my shoe.  

It showed a picture of… well of me. Or someone who looked suspiciously like me. My hair, glasses and even the cardigan I was currently wearing.  

*Impossible.* 

I snatched the book from the floor. The first page showed me, if it was me, in the library smiling. Then cleaning and locking up, putting books on shelves, and then leaving to get into my car.  

A shiver traveled down my spine. What was this? A joke? It looked like a children’s book, there were no words, only pictures.  

The last page terrified me, my hands trembled, and my mouth went as dry as cotton.  

I was in my Honda, and it looked like I was pounding on the windows, screaming, as flames poured out from under the hood and engulfed the car. 

I left the cart and took the book to the front desk and locked it in the drawer. I didn’t know where it had come from or how any of this was possible. It had me wondering if perhaps there was a gas leak at the library, and I was hallucinating. I’d heard of that happening to people in their homes on the news.  

But I didn’t smell any gas, and it was summer after all. The heating system would remain dormant for months yet.  

I shook my head, said a prayer, and then gathered myself and my things. The walk to the parking lot was shaky, my knees felt weak, and I couldn’t stop trembling.  

My car sat ominously in the stall. It wasn’t on fire, it looked perfectly fine and normal. But I just couldn’t bring myself to drive it, so I decided to walk home.  

I lived only a couple of blocks away and it was a beautiful evening. I convinced myself I wasn’t being paranoid, that perhaps I needed the fresh air to clear my head and that walking was a wonderful idea.  

That night I dreamt of burning, my flesh charring away from the bone on my forearms as I cried out for help, pounding on the glass. Neighbors passed by but wouldn’t even look my way as I cooked inside the car. My flesh melted like candle wax as muscle and tissue sizzled like meat over charcoal. 

I awoke at first light, drenched in sweat and with a pounding headache from grinding my teeth through the night. I shook it off, chalking it up to nonsense and made an extra strong pot of coffee, determined to put the dream and the book out of my mind.  

The sun was warm, and I could smell the fresh lavender from Mrs. Jameson’s yard.  

*It’s going to be a good day, don’t worry.* I told myself.  

But it wasn’t… not at all.  

I reached the library to see two firetrucks and an ambulance in the parking lot. Smoke billowed a hundred feet up in the air as they sprayed water at the inferno that was once my Honda Accord.  

I couldn’t believe it… I stood for a while in shock watching as they put out the fire.  

They told me it must have been an electrical issue that caught the engine ablaze and to contact my insurance company immediately.

I placed a sign on the door that stated the library would be closed today and sorry for any inconvenience. I was too shook up… it would be impossible to work through it. 

I was about to leave again when I thought about the book. The idea of looking at it again almost made me sick, but the curiosity outweighed my trepidation.  

I unlocked the drawer and slid it open and there it was. Today it looked more like a blood red to me, rather unpleasantly so, but that could have been because I knew what it contained.  

I sat it on the table, taking a deep breath before opening it once more. The pages were blank again as before, but they quickly began painting themselves just like they did last night.  

This time I saw Mr. Davis who owned the gas station on the corner. He was counting inventory when a hooded man entered the store. They seemed to wrestle for a moment on the pages before the cloaked man stabbed him repeatedly in the chest. Blood puddled at the bottom of the page, the ink was so wet it stained my fingers red.  

My heart thundered in my chest.  

*What do I do?* 

I thought about calling the police, but how would I explain myself?  

*Yes, hello officer, you see I have this magic book that predicts horrible things and I think Mr. Davis is in danger. Please head there immediately.*  

No… that wouldn’t do. I tucked the book under my arm and took it with me this time. Urgency rippled through my body as I sprinted all the way to the corner of Main Street. I burst through the double doors of the Nickel Saver and ran through the back of the store.  

As I was rounding the corner I slipped on the wet floor and smacked my head on the tile. My vision spun for a moment before I could sit up. I put my hand in something wet and impossibly thick. I brought it to my face. Blood dripped down my fingers, soaking my sleeve in crimson.  

I rolled to the side and saw Mr. Davis struggling to breathe. His body spasmed as blood spurt from his lips and down his neck. A whistling sound came from his chest through punctured lungs.  

“Oh dear God. Mr. Davis, stay with me!” I cried as I cradled his head in my lap.  

I scrambled to dial 911 on my cell phone.  

His eyes… his eyes were so full of fear, they begged me for help.  

“It’s okay sir, I’ve got you. It’s going to be okay.” I pushed his gray hair from his face and begged God not to take him.  

I told the operator that I needed the police here immediately, that Mr. Davis had been stabbed and was bleeding out. 

“*Jesus, please hurry*!” I pleaded.

It took them eight minutes to get there, which was about two minutes too late. Clark Davis died in my arms, murdered at the age of fifty-six. I was still holding him when they stormed through the back of the gas station. I was crying and rocking him in my arms, humming a lullaby that my mother used to sing to me as a child. 

After an hour of being checked over by paramedics and then another half hour of questioning by the police, I was sent on my way home.  

I wept uncontrollably for three days after that. My assistant, Natalie, came off of maternity leave early to take over at the library for a while, bless her heart.  

It took a week before I opened the book again. But when I did, I made a promise to myself that I would try to prevent as many deaths as I could, just like I had my own with the car fire.  

Sometimes I could, and sometimes I couldn’t.  

Sometimes it was people I knew, and other times it depicted deaths of people I’d never seen before but read about in the paper from a neighboring county days later.  

This went on for over a year.  

Until one death broke me… 

Little Liam Bohanon. 

By the time I had made it to the train tracks in Richmond, pieces of his tiny body had already been spread across a quarter mile of tracks. 

It broke more than just my heart, I was never the same again… 

I’m tired. So very weary in my bones. 

So now I’m reaching out to you dear friends… I still have the book. But the responsibility is too heavy for me to bear any longer. 

I need someone to take my place. 

I hope to God one of you will. 

And I pray that you have the strength to [weather it…](https://www.reddit.com/r/TerrorTherapy/)
