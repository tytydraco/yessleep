This happened just a few minutes ago to me and my two  friends. 

I live in a city near Naples, in Italy. We had a great Party with all the families of my friends playing traditional Neapolitan “card games”, like Tombola and Cucù. We were turning back home and the way was short, so we were on foot. We were chatting about the how great the evening and how much money  we had  lost playing Tombola, when suddenly a man (in his 30s I suppose) sneaked crouched between us nay, between our legs without any sound or doing anything. My father thought it was a thief or something like that and asked him what was he doing. He didn’t say anything, like he didn’t heard. Then he ran behind a car, and after a little he returned, aiming at our feet with a toy pistol ( like the ones with the orange tip) then he sneaked again behind an other car. All of this very quickly so we weren’t actually realising what he was trying to do ( even now I don’t). He was clearly chasing us, and me and the  two friends of my were more than scared even if we were laughing hard because of this guy.  We sped up the pace and when we tourned back again he was running away. In the first place I thought it was funny, but after thinking about it I find it terrifying. It’s not the first time we encounter strange people, but I think this time he was the strangest. 

The fuck just happened? Is this like a challenge or anything? The man was in black clothes, he didn’t have a ski mask, but he had a berret. I think he was trying to rob us, but when he saw my chad dad went away. Or maybe he was just a strange person. A REALLY strange person.

The story is actually true and I don’t know if it is the right place to write it. 

Apparently I have to write minimum 500 words so I’ll tell you this other fact about my city.

My friends and I are doing a Pokédex of strange people we find, it’s called “ I soliti ignoti”. It means “the usual unknown “. We also put in it the young black woman that one time stopped me and a friend of my and started to talk to us like we were old friends. It was like 2 am and she was clearly high, we were freaking out. She started asking us about our Zodiac sign, like very often, asking it again and again and changing hers every time. She also said that I wanted to die because I am  a Virgo(?). My friend was really scared so I said to her that we had to go ( she was under my house)very terrifying.  Moreover she first walked in front of us like nothing, then she turned back to talk to us, and it was for me really  strange . Me and my friends are getting used to things like these, but I know it’s not a good thing and I’m not enjoying this city like before, when I was a child. Now I am a teenager, so I am in an age where people think you are way dumber than an adult and think they can take your money like nothing or make fun of us without we noticing it.
