They told me the house was empty when we moved in.

It was a foreclosure—three bedrooms, one bathroom, broken porch light. My mom called it “a fresh start.” I was thirteen. Too old to believe in monsters. Too young to know some monsters wear your face.

We unpacked in silence. Still grieving. Still trying not to say my little brother’s name. Josh had been dead for six months. Drowned in the neighbor’s pool while I was supposed to be watching him.

I didn’t cry at the funeral. I haven’t cried since. But when I first saw the attic window, I swear to God…
he was waving at me. The attic had no stairs, just one of those fold-down ladders. We never opened it. There was no reason to.

But every night, around 2:15 a.m., I’d hear footsteps above my ceiling. Light ones. Running. Like a child playing tag. I told myself it was rats. Or the house settling. I told myself that every night for a week.

Then I started waking up with toys at the foot of my bed. Old toys. Not mine. Not Josh’s either. Wood-carved blocks, tiny animal figurines made of glass, a spinning top that never stopped moving.

The last one was a note. Crayon. Big, shaky letters: “DO YOU REMEMBER ME YET?” I showed it to Mom. She didn’t even look.She was tired all the time. Worn down. Grief makes people soft around the edges, like butter left out too long.

She just said, “Don’t go into the attic.” I hadn’t told her it came from the attic. The noises got louder. Dragging sounds. Breathing. Whispers that didn’t feel like they came through ears, but through skin. Then, the laughter started. Not mean. Not evil. Childish. Innocent.

It was Josh’s laugh. I know that laugh. I’d made it happen a thousand times—hide-and-seek, finger puppets, dumb knock-knock jokes. Now it was coming from above my bed.

I broke. I couldn’t take it anymore. I pulled down the attic ladder around 3 a.m., flashlight in hand, heart caving in on itself. My hands were shaking so bad I dropped the light, but I climbed anyway.

The attic was cold. Dusty. Empty. Except for a mirror in the corner. I didn’t see myself in it. I saw him, Josh, smiling. Wearing the same swim trunks he drowned in.

Only… he had no eyes. Just two empty sockets, leaking something black and slow. He raised one hand and wrote in the fog on the mirror: “YOU LEFT ME.”

I ran. I didn’t look back. But every night since, the attic ladder is down when I wake up. And last night, I found water in my bed. Salt water.

I told my mom again. Begged her to leave the house. She just looked at me and said: “That’s not Josh.” I asked her how she knew. She didn’t answer. Just went back to watching the attic window.

It’s 2:14 a.m. now. I can hear him again. Running. I know what’s coming. I don’t know if I’ll be here tomorrow. But if you move into this house… don’t look at the window. And whatever you do—don’t wave back.
