Hi. This feels weird to write. I never thought I’d actually post something here. I’ve been reading stories on this sub for years, and honestly, I never fully believed any of them. But this is real.

And ever since it happened, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being watched. I’m not using my real name. I already made that mistake once. You can call me Jake. I’m 27 now and I recently moved out of my parents’ house. The place isn’t great, but it’s all I can afford working as a bartender at a local bar.

I’ve always been fascinated by the internet and the weird stuff hidden in it. When I was younger, I really wanted to be a software engineer. I took a few courses here and there, but it turned out I just wasn’t good at it.

Back in 2009, my grandpa gave me my first computer (RIP), and I was obsessed. Like, completely. I searched everything. You know how teenage boys are. Then, around 2010, I discovered YouTube.

Back then, it felt like a different world. I’d spend hours watching random videos, clicking on anything that looked interesting. There weren’t really “YouTubers” yet, not like today.

That’s when I found her channel.

It was run by a girl in her early twenties. She’d record herself talking about her day. Nothing fancy. But she was funny. Natural.

Her name was Claire.

Her channel had a weird name I couldn’t remember for years, until recently:

bringingponysclair.

I was a quiet kid at school. Didn’t have many friends. Honestly, I’m not even sure I had any. Watching her videos felt like having a friend, even though I never talked to her. Looking back, it was probably a crush. I never commented because I was scared she’d reply.

But I watched every single video. She uploaded every day. Sometimes twice a day.

In 2011, she started posting less. I assumed college, or a boyfriend, or life. Didn’t think much of it.

Then the videos changed.

They weren’t obviously fake or paranormal. Just… disturbing.

In the first one, she was wearing a jacket that looked wet. It was mid-January, so I thought it was snow. She sat in front of the camera, eyes wide open, and didn’t say a word for about ten seconds.

When she finally spoke, she didn’t stop.

It’s been over ten years, but I still remember her exact words:

“Hey guys. I don’t really know how to say this, but I think someone is following me.

It started online. I didn’t think it was serious, but today I actually saw someone.”

(She paused.)

“I was walking Frodo (her dog) and I heard the weirdest laugh. It was low, but close. I ran home and called the cops.

I’m posting this to let you know I’ll be gone for a while. The police said it’s safer, in case the stalker is watching my videos.

Kiss kiss. See you soon.”

She smiled at the end, but it felt wrong. Forced.

At first, I thought it was a prank. Some weird internet thing. I wasn’t really scared.

Then the uploads stopped.

A month passed. No updates. And yeah, as messed up as it sounds, I eventually forgot about her.

In 2012, she uploaded again.

She looked happy. Smiling. Wearing a beautiful dress. The background was different, like she had moved. Her voice sounded raspy, almost damaged.

I don’t remember everything she said, but she mentioned having a job and seeing someone. Sixteen-year-old me felt stupidly crushed. I hate admitting that.

After that, I stopped thinking about her.

Until November.

It was around 2 a.m. I was playing Resident Evil 4, stuck on a boss for hours, when my computer suddenly exploded with notifications. Loud. Way louder than anything I remembered setting up.

I almost fainted.

I rushed to mute it before my mom woke up. That’s when I saw it.

A new video on her channel.

*amusement.mp4*

I clicked it and put my headphones on.

Ten seconds. Total darkness. Nothing visible.

It scared the shit out of me.

Then another one appeared:

*Bigsimimimileee.mp4*

Shorter. A bright red light. I could barely see part of what looked like a chair. Then I heard it.

A laugh.

At first, I couldn’t tell what it was. Then I replayed it.

Definitely a laugh.

Then the third video uploaded.

I still get goosebumps thinking about it.

This time I could see everything. It looked like a huge, empty factory. In front of the camera was a chair under an upside-down lamp glowing red.

Someone was sitting there.

It looked like a woman. Her mouth was stretched into a huge smile, almost euphoric. She barely had teeth. Her hair was almost gone, just thin strands. No eyebrows. She was tied to the chair.

I kept telling myself the channel had been hacked.

Then her smile kept getting wider. Too wide. Like it hurt.

She stopped smiling.

She screamed.

The camera moved closer.

It was her.

Claire.

Someone stepped behind her. I couldn’t see their face.

The video cut.

I threw up. I cried. My mom came into my room. When I tried to show her the videos, they were gone. The channel was gone. Like it never existed.

Claire never uploaded again.

You’re probably wondering why I didn’t call the police. What would I have said? She lived in another city, maybe another state. I had no proof.

When I mentioned her later, nobody remembered her. It felt like I was crazy.

So I convinced myself it was fake. A project. Acting.

Ten years passed.

I hadn’t thought about her since.

Until 40 minutes ago.

My phone made the same notification sound my computer did back in 2009.

Private number.

One message:

*comeseeme.mp4 -bringingponysclair*

My heart dropped.

I clicked the link.

First video: darkness. That same laugh.

Cut.

Second video: the room from her old videos. Abandoned. Rotting. Maggots and cockroaches everywhere.

Cut.

Close-up of a photo.

At first, I didn’t recognize it.

Then the camera steadied.

It was me.

The last clip was just audio.

Her voice.

“Come see me. Kiss kiss.”

The same thing she used to say at the end of every video.

My phone crashed right after. When I tried to save anything, it didn’t work. It was infected with something so bad I had to reset it completely.

I’m staying at a friend’s place for a few days. I don’t know if I should call the police. What would they even do? She’s been missing since 2012. This could be AI. I hate the 2020s. If anyone here remembers Claire or that channel, please say something.

I need help.
