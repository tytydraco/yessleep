Hi guys, 

I would like to apologise for any confusion caused…I think my overtime shifts at the Tunnelwig are draining me. As a result I’m even more stupid than usual.

Many thanks to those of you who offered suggestions as to what I should do. One person said I should flat out refuse to clean the soft play until the beetle bin’s removed.

I think in other circumstances I would. I don’t want to cause friction with my manager. Plus, overtime money.

Yesterday evening, I arrived a little early and headed to reception. “Hi,” I swallowed, “uh–I was cleaning the soft play last night, and one of the bins smelled really bad…” I trailed off as the receptionist’s disdainful look dried me up. “Could you please ask one of the janitors to take a look for me?”

“Did you change the binbag?” 

“I tried, but whatever’s in there has leaked and it’s stuck to the bottom.”

With a long sigh, she picked up a pen and scrawled a note into the janitor’s book. I thanked her and made my way to the Soft Play. I stuck a podcast in my ears. Maybe a touch of brain rot would distract me from the crawling melancholy that came over me the night before. 

Pushing open the door, I was hit by a wave of freezing air. Why did they keep it so cold? I pulled my jacket over my shoulders and set to work. Time passed quicker than the night before; I knew the job better, and there was less mess, it being a weekday night. As a kid, I usually came to the soft play on weekdays after Mum pulled me out of school. There were two reasons for this: one, it was quieter (which reduces my public meltdowns) and two, it meant I could enjoy the play centre after I stopped getting invited to other kids’ birthday parties. 

As I leaned over to plunge my mop into the bucket, a memory slammed into my head like a truck. I had been to a party here once. The birthday boy, Jay, was turning six. The whole class was invited, so he couldn’t leave me out. I spent the entire time playing in the ball pit. 

A series of images danced before my eyes: red, green, and yellow plastic balls rising up around me; a cluster of my classmates giggling through the mesh, looking over at me here and there; the stench; crying, in Mum’s arms; driving home before they cut the cake. 

That was when the smell came back. It was as eye-watering as when I’d stood over the open bin, though now, I stood meters away. I covered my nose. No matter where I went, the smell persisted; a noxious ghost at every corner of the room. I persevered, holding my breath, but it soon overpowered me. The sticky, sickly, sweet rot was all I could perceive. I was forced to stagger upstairs to escape. There, it was a fraction better. The closer I got to the soft play’s entrance, the fainter it became. 

I checked my phone. It was only fifteen minutes to my shift’s end. Reaching behind me, I pulled my feather duster from the caddy, knelt down, and crawled into the tunnel. My knees were comfortable against the cushioned floor, and the smell melted away. I had not realized how much my bones were aching until I let myself rest. I work two jobs and get up at 4 am to get to my first shift. Adding overtime to that is pushing my stamina. But what choice did I have? I tend to annoy bosses and colleagues just as much as I angered my friends at school. It’s just how I am. That’s why I got into cleaning. It’s long hours, early starts, and late finishes–but I can get on with my work, and others don’t have to deal with me. I don’t bother them, and they don’t bother me. 

You could never bother me. I opened my eyes. I hadn’t realized they were closed. At first, I thought the words came from a kindly internal voice–in my head, I mean. You know (I’m sure) how you’re internal monologue sounds? It wasn’t like that. It wasn’t my voice. It belonged to someone else. It sounded a little like my grandma but… thinner. The vowels were more crisp, the tone mottled. It was long and soft, with many spindly arms gently waving and long, silvery hair. The soft play mat was warm beneath my cheek. 

I lifted my head quickly. What if there were cameras in here? If someone saw me knelt prayer-like with my head against the cushions, I’d get sacked or, at the very least, sent to a shrink. I stumbled to my feet and packed away my hoover and caddy, aware of a mysterious yet acute sense of mourning. 

The wifi is shit in the soft play, so Mum’s message didn’t ping on my phone until I reached the cloakroom. “Hi love! I’m outside.”

Shit. I stuffed my keys into my pocket, grabbed my bag and ran back to reception. I clocked out as quickly as I could. Outside, I scanned the dark, rain-lashed car park for the tinny Mercedes C-class. I am far too old for rides home with family. That said, I hadn’t asked her to pick me up. She’d swung by anyway. 

“Sorry,” I opened the door and hopped inside. Mum grinned. “How was work?” I asked. 

“I need another job,” she answered. I laughed. “As bad as that?”

She looked at me. Her long, dark hair was tied in a ponytail that now bore the first strands of silver. She was fifty, after all. Her face curled in concern as she flicked the indicator and turned her attention back to the road. “You look tired, sweetheart.” 

I laughed and rubbed my eyes. “Yeah, I am. I am ok, though.” 

“I should never have taken you.”

“What?”

“I said I should never have taken you to the soft play.”

I thought for a second. “Don’t be daft, Mama.”

“It was too much for you,” she said, turning into our road. “Look–you’re crying and exhausted. The other kids were mean again, weren’t they?”

“Yes, they were. But it’s my fault,” I added, “I was being weird…I think I miss Grandma.”

“Aww,” Mum looked so sad. We drove on in silence for a minute or so. 

“Wait–no, Mama. The other kids weren’t there today.”

She frowned. “Huh?” 

“It’s a weeknight, remember?” 

Mum nodded. I looked back at the road, only to find myself parked on my drive. I stayed in the car a second, letting the tears fall of their own accord. Good Lord, I thought, I miss her so much. 

I got out of the car and got inside the house. I made some food, took it to my room, and watched some YouTube for a bit. Has anyone else had weird shit in their feed recently? My YouTube history consists entirely of ‘Real Housewives’ clips, and Creepcast. So tell me why there was a wildlife documentary at the top of my recommended videos?! 

I ended up watching it anyway. I love animals, and it was a pretty cool episode. I put my phone on charge and let David Attenborough’s dulcet tones serenade me with the lifecycle of Darkling Beetles:

“Feed on decaying fruits…sweet decay…larvae….pie dish beetle…thin, vellous silver hairs on their back…radiation…predation….abomination…blasphemy…”

Satisfied that autoplay was on, I let myself drift further into reverie. 

“...eggs laid in willing hosts…wigs grow to full size in seconds…no less than you deserve….may your carcass rot in unhallowed ground…” 

I was almost asleep when I felt something brush against my face. I turned my head. Another scuff; I opened my eyes. There, on my duvet, beside my hand which was half-curled in sleep, was a beetle. Its back shone like a jewel in the moonlight. With a yelp, I tried to flick it from the covers but it clung on. It was the same size as my phone. Its horns rose like TV aerials, at least five inches long. Its limbs spread akimbo, in a shrug. 

It was that manner of insect that makes you sick just by looking at it. I squealed and hurled my duvet off the bed to put some distance between myself and the freaky bug. 

It was a grave mistake. The creepy crawly had already done its work. As soon as the duvet hit the ground, the smell of putrefaction and birthday cake rose festered from my body. My skin was covered in round, suppurating holes where the wig’s eggs were laid and hatched. Hungry generations scuttled underneath my pajamas. I felt larvae crawling through my breasts. Winged legions flew in and out of the cracks of my arms, thighs, and abdomen as a thousand dot-like black beetles swelled bigger by the instant inside my mouth and scuttled down my throat. I thrashed to free myself. But I had more limbs, now, than I could control. The extra arms hung heavy at my sides as the hatchlings gnawed their way through my eardrums and clawed through my skull to taste the fatty brain meat within. I screamed in agony. 

Thankfully, my scream woke me up. Good thing I live alone. I hope the neighbors didn’t hear me. No one said anything over the weekend, so I am pretty hopeful that I did not disturb them. 

I’ve had night terrors before. It’s usually just a sign that I am stressed, so I called in sick this morning. I have today off but I still have to do tonight’s shift as Nadia has still not come back to work. 

I’m going to try and chill today. I’m taking my book down to the park. If you need me, I will be feeding the canada geese. 

I do not want to take more hours, but I need the money. I’ll let you know how tonight goes  and will update tomorrow. 

Thanks.
