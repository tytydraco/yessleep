Hey guys,

I know you think I’m crazy for going back. For not quitting.  
  
Part of me wanted to never step foot in that house again. To block their number and pretend none of it ever happened.

But I couldn’t. Not after what happened.

I couldn’t abandon Jamie. Not after seeing the way he looked at me that night - wide-eyed, terrified, begging me not to leave him alone. That kind of fear doesn’t come from a child’s imagination. That was something real. Something he *knew*.

And the worst part?  
I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d made things worse. That by opening that basement door, I’d stirred something awake. That Jamie was in more danger now than ever before.

So when Friday came around, I went back.

The drive there felt endless. Rain lashed against the windshield, and every flash of lightning made me jump. The road to the house was long and twisting, lined with dark trees that seemed to lean in closer the farther I went. I almost turned around twice. Almost.

When I finally pulled into the driveway, the house had never looked so creepy and unwelcoming. It would have been bad enough on a bright summer’s day, but with the rain, the dark grey clouds hanging low, the flashes of lighting and grumbling of thunder, it filled me with terror.

The evening passed quietly. Too quietly. The storm outside rattled the windows, rain streaking down the glass like grasping fingers. The house always had this heavy, tense energy to it, but tonight it was sharper - like the air itself was holding its breath.

After I tucked Jamie in, I went downstairs and curled up on the couch, trying to focus on my phone screen. My reflection stared back at me in the darkened TV - pale, wide-eyed, waiting. The sound of the wind and the occasional creak of the house were my only company.

Then came the soft creak of the staircase.

I sat up straight, my pulse spiking. But when I turned, it was only Jamie - padding down the steps in his pyjamas, clutching his blanket. Without saying a word, he sat on the rug and started building something with his Lego.

That… wasn’t like him. Normally, he couldn’t wait to get to bed, to escape being anywhere near the basement after dark. He also seemed to *need* to be asleep by nine - as if he *knew* something would happen if he wasn’t.

So I let him stay. Honestly, I wanted him close too. Maybe we both needed that comfort. Breaking one of the rules - just this once - didn’t seem like it could hurt.

And that’s when I decided to try.  
 To ask.

I couldn’t just keep pretending not to see the signs. The parents clearly weren’t going to tell me anything, but Jamie… maybe he would.

I needed answers.

“So…” I said lightly, forcing my voice not to shake. “When did you first hear the man in the basement?”

He didn’t look up. Just shrugged. “Don’t know.”

My stomach twisted. “Has he… been there for a long time?”

Jamie clicked two Lego pieces together, still not meeting my eyes. “Forever, I think.”

Forever.  
  
That word hit me like ice water.

I swallowed hard, lowering my voice. “What does he want, Jamie?”

He froze. His little hands hovered in midair, motionless. The sound of the rain filled the silence. His shoulders went rigid, like he was holding his breath.

My pulse thundered in my ears.

And then - he moved again, shrugging, forcing out the words. “Don’t know.”

It didn’t sound real. It sounded *rehearsed*.

I stared at him, throat dry, my mind screaming at me to keep pushing. To demand the truth. But something deep inside - instinct, maybe - told me to stop. That I was already trespassing.

And then the lights flickered.

Once.  
  
Twice.

And the house plunged into darkness.

I jolted, fumbling for my phone. The storm outside howled, the wind shrieking against the windows. My torch on my phone cut a thin, trembling beam across the room.

“Jamie?” I whispered.

Silence.

I swung the light toward the rug. Empty.  
The Legos were scattered. The blanket was crumpled. But Jamie was gone.

“Jamie?” My voice cracked.

My chest tightened as panic clawed up my throat. I shone the light around - under the table, behind the couch, toward the stairs - nothing.

The old house groaned under the storm’s weight, floorboards creaking like footsteps. I forced myself down the hallway, each shadow stretching longer, darker.

And that’s when I saw him.

At the very end of the hallway. Crouched in the corner.

The light caught his face, and my breath stopped. Relief surged - there he was - but it died instantly. His eyes didn’t look like Jamie’s. They were darker, sunken, wrong. His body was stiff, like he wasn’t the one holding himself up.

“Jamie?” I whispered.

His head snapped toward me. Too fast.

And the voice that came out wasn’t his.

“Leave.”

It was low and guttural, vibrating through the floorboards.

“Jamie, it’s me, it’s-”

“LEAVE!” The voice roared, shaking the walls, echoing from everywhere at once.

The air exploded. The storm outside slammed into the house, glass rattling, papers and toys skittering across the floor. My phone flickered wildly as I stumbled backward, covering my ears.

When I looked up again, he was no longer crouching.

  
For a second, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me - the flickering light, the storm outside, the shadows shifting on the walls. But then I saw it.  
His toes weren’t touching the ground.

They hovered an inch above the floorboards, trembling. Then two inches. Then three.

My breath hitched. I couldn’t even blink. Jamie’s small body rose slowly, unnaturally, like invisible hands were lifting him by the shoulders. His head lolled back, his hair spilling away from his face as if gravity had forgotten him entirely.

The air changed. It thickened - charged with something electric and wrong. My phone’s torch flickered, the beam trembling across his face. His eyes were open now, rolled white, his mouth slack. And then - it moved.

His lips curled into something that wasn’t a smile.

A low rumble vibrated through the room, a sound that didn’t belong in any human throat.

And then, through that same small mouth, a voice poured out - ancient, guttural, filled with fury.

“You can’t save him,” it growled. “He’s mine.”

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t even scream. My body was ice. My heart pounded so hard I thought it might stop.

Then - just as suddenly - he dropped.

The thud of his body hitting the floor snapped me out of it. The lights buzzed, flared, and the storm silenced in an instant.

I stood frozen for a second, waiting for something else to happen. Then I ran.

Jamie was limp, trembling, skin pale and cold. His chest rose and fell in shallow, uneven breaths.

“Jamie?” I whispered, my hands shaking as I brushed his hair from his forehead.

He stirred, eyes fluttering open, and in the softest, most broken voice, he whispered, “What happened?”

And I broke. I held him tight, feeling his tiny body tremble against mine.

I carried him up to bed in my arms. And held him while he slept.

I didn’t have answers. I didn’t know what I’d brought into that house - or what I’d unleashed.

But one thing was certain:  
  
I wasn’t going to leave him.  
  
Not now.  
  
Not ever.
