[\[Final\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1o866a7/the_call_of_the_breach_final/)

From the concealment of the snow-laden pines, I watched as the slate gray helicopters descended from the clouds, and three of them settled down on the other side of the small valley. The fourth remained in the air high overhead, circling in long, slow loops, its doors open to reveal both a machine gunner and a sniper with their weapons at the ready. Two of the landed birds disgorged teams of ELSAR regulars to secure the area, while the third waited behind them, its rotors slowed to a patient idle. Koranti was no fool; if in fact he was down there, he wouldn’t emerge until I did.

*Trust but verify, as Chris would have said. Then again, he would never have let ELSAR get this close to me, not after last time. Dear God, I miss him.*

In the tree line around me, the others waited in silence, their eyes on the enemy, exhaustion etched on their grimy faces. In total, of the 300 men that had volunteered to stay with Sean, and the roughly 100 that had been with Chris’s rearguard, only 48 still drew breath by the night’s end. Most of Chris’s force had been slaughtered to a man, the corpses unrecognizable from how their skin had melted in the extreme heat of the barrage, while Sean’s had been either buried by the shellfire or shot to pieces in the fighting. Dozens were missing, either disintegrated by the rockets or captured by the Auxiliaries. We hadn’t bothered to dig graves, as no one had the energy. Instead, I linked up with a few rifle squads and together we fought off the last of Crow’s assault troops, before I ordered a withdrawal down the southern cliffs to avoid the inevitable artillery reprisal from ELSAR.

It had been a grueling experience; the cliffs were sheer drops, and many didn’t have the strength to hold on to the slippery ice-covered rocks. Two of the crude ropes we fashioned from vines snapped, and seven men plummeted to their deaths. I myself had nearly been one of them, saved by a dried-out Russian Olive bush that still had good roots in the stones. Once on the ground, we’d marched through the night to get to the meeting spot, an untouched portion of the valley that still had enough cover for us to hide from ELSAR drones. Another two of our number died on the way, one from a bullet wound we had no way to treat, and another by a lone Birch Crawler male that ambushed us in the bush country. By the time the sky began to turn pink with the dawn, thirty-nine half frozen troopers followed me over a steep outcropping to cross back into the north.

With one thumb, I dug into a tear in my pant leg, not so much for nerves, but to feel something, anything other than the oppressive weight in my chest.

“We should kill him while we have the chance.” Propped against a tree to my left, Sergeant Charlie Mcphearson stared into space, his cheeks hollow, eyes dull from fatigue. He’d been the first man to come find me on the ridgeline and helped the lone medic to extract the bullet fragments from my ankle. I’d gotten lucky, he said. It was only a piece of the round and hadn’t gone too deep.

Somehow, that didn’t make me feel any better.

I swallowed, and my gullet twinged in a way that told me I had a sore throat coming on. “I have to get close for this to work.”

Of course, this could be an ambush, and Koranti might very well not be there at all, but I had come too far to turn back now. Leaning Jamie’s AK against a birch tree, I shrugged off my chest rig and war belt.

*No more putting it off.*

At each step, my boots weighed a thousand pounds, dread like poison in my veins. The snow crunched underfoot, my toes numb from the cold, the woolen socks soaked clean through once more. Around my head, tiny snowflakes tumbled in another cheery December morning, something that would have pleased the old Hannah back in Louisville. I couldn’t even imagine my former life, with its boredom, its safety, its fixation on trivial things to amuse myself. It was as if I never existed in such a space, the modern world a make-believe fairy tale that I told myself, an impossible place of lights, warmth, and mountains of food.

No sooner did I emerge from the tree line, and the cordon of ELSAR men pointed their rifles at me, calling to one another on their radios.

I raised my hands and slowly lifted my jacket up so they could see my waist, turning in a slow circle enough to let them inspect my lower back. These men were professionals, and I knew if I wanted this to work, I had to play along. They were justifiably nervous, what with their boss watching their every move, and one wrong step on my part could set them off.

*“She’s clear.”* I heard one of them bark into his radio mic, and at that, the door to the third helicopter slid open.

Even from here, I could sense the ruthless calm on his clean-shaven face, the lack of concern for the precariousness of his own situation as Koranti walked to our meeting point. He wore a simple dark coat over his suit, no hat atop his well-combed hair, and a pair of stylish leather boots polished black. A man in a business suit shuffled along to his left, doubtless some kind of corporate assistant for the fact that he’d chosen plain office shoes to wear to the occasion. Another ELSAR officer strode to Koranti’s right, a non-descript replacement for Crow, with a winter overcoat and more appropriate tactical boots that told me he’d been in the field before. Two pale-faced aides rushed to unfold a small plastic folding table on the field between us, along with four white-plastic folding chairs that they tossed blankets over to ward off the cold. By the time we met in the middle, the aides scuttled away, and we faced each other across the little table with silent anticipation.

Standing there, my worn-out boots seeping in the cold, I thought back to the last time Koranti and I had seen each other, in Black Oak during the first round of negotiations. He’d been smug then, but now he positively glowed, a quiet but assured triumph in his eyes that made anger spark in my brain like a rising flame.

*Oh, to get my hands around your pampered neck, you arrogant, slick haired . . .*

“I see your delegation is much thinner than last time.” His words were like honey, smooth and confident, as Koranti slid into his chair with relaxed ease. The two other men did the same, no effort made to shake hands with me, keeping silent while their employer carried on. “A terrible shame it had to come to this. So many lives wasted over such a trivial misunderstanding.”

*Don’t claw his eyes out, don’t claw his eyes out, don’t claw his eyes out.*

Teeth gritted to keep myself in check, I limped to my chair and resisted the urge to pull the blanket draped there around my shoulders. “If that’s what you want to call it.”

His toffee brown eyes focused on mine, and Koranti folded his hands in front of him with a patient sternness. “Oh, I call it a miscalculation, both on your side, and on mine. I relied too much on local sources from the outset, trusted that dolt of a sheriff to keep things contained, and by the time we stepped in it was too late. Your mistake was to think that fighting was a path to victory.”

“I have my terms.” Unwilling to carry the conversation any further than need be, I pushed one hand into my coat, slow enough to keep the officer on Koranti’s right from reaching for his pistol. Out came the wad of papers I’d worked on during the march, creased and water-stained, but I smoothed them flat on the tabletop between us. “You’ll have three days to implement them, but no more. We’ll need the next two after that for preparation, and I have to be sure your people are clear by then.”

Koranti’s trimmed eyebrows arched on his forehead and he blinked at me in amusement. “I was under the impression we had an understanding. You are not in a position to make demands. We won’t be considering anything other than an end to hostilities, and your surrender. That’s the deal.”

*Keep your cool. You can do this. Just stay calm.*

My pulse picked up, but I kept each breath steady and straightened my back in the icy chair. “You know the Breach is closed, you can tell from the satellite readings and your own measurements in the field, but you also know we never activated the beacons in correct sequence. That means either it just closed on its own, which we both know isn’t likely, or something happened in there that you didn’t account for. Something I know about.”

On the left, the man in a civilian suit made a smirk and chuckled under his breath. “Is this some kind of joke?”

But Koranti’s eyes lost some of their glimmer as he watched me, and I knew that *he knew* I wasn’t lying. He was a smart man, too smart, and he’d always been able to see right through me. It had been him, after all, who explained the situation with the Breach to me in his brand new high-rise headquarters in Black Oak after my surgery. I didn’t have to convince his goons, just Koranti himself.

“Whatever happened in there,” Koranti rasped, his voice taking on a dry tinge, and he leaned forward in his chair with a hardened frown. “It doesn’t change the reality on the ground. We’ve won; the sooner you accept that, the sooner your people stop dying. You could help ensure their survival. We can accomplish so much more together.”

*I’d rather eat broken glass.*

Crossing my arms, I tried not to press down on my uniform too hard, lest the fake padding crush and reveal what lay hidden beneath. For once, I was glad not to have too much ‘stuffing’ as my dear grandmother would have said. “You told me that when something enters our world from another reality, something else has to leave in order for there to be balance, right? Well, we’re about to get re-balanced. The Breach is shut, but it’s going to take us all with it, and if you’re still here when it happens, you’ll be stuck too.”

They blinked at me, the three of them in various stages of disbelief. The corporate lackey seemed incredulous, as though he still thought I was making it all up, while the military man scanned the woods behind me for signs of an ambush. Only Koranti remained stoic, though from how the corners of his mouth twitched, I could sense his resolve crumbling. He believed me, deep down I knew it, and that ate away at him because it meant there was information at play that wasn’t his to wield.

*So I need to exploit that and make him lose his nerve.*

With one hand, I slid the wrinkled papers closer to the delegation, but as their eyes were on the treaty, I tucked the opposite palm into my jacket and tugged loose one of the hidden strings stitched under my uniform. This would only work if I was fast, and if anyone backed out, or pulled a trigger before I had time to do what I needed to, everything would be lost.

“You have 72 hours to evacuate all your personnel, and hand over any prisoners of ours that you’ve taken.” I squared my shoulders against a frigid gust of wind and nodded at the document held in place with my finger so the pages didn’t blow away. “You’ll provide the things we originally agreed upon on our last ceasefire; food, meds, ammo, as much as we need for the winter. Any prisoners we have will be returned, and you’ll clear out before the transition happens.”

“No.” Koranti’s resolve returned, and he sat back in his chair to shake his head with a barely concealed snort of irritation. He clearly didn’t enjoy being blindsided, and whether he believed me or not, he was going to be stubborn to the end. “Even if I *did* believe you, why would we pull back and let you rearm based solely on your word? I have no reason to trust you.”

“You can trust that if you don’t, we’ll make the war that much worse.” I angled my head at the ridgeline behind me. “If it was as simple to clear us out as you say, I’d be dead already. My people are ready to die for what they believe in, but are yours? How many of your boys didn’t come in to work this morning? Where is Colonel Riken?”

That made the military officer shift in his seat with an uncomfortable wince, and I knew I’d found a pressure point.

*I can only imagine what damage that man is doing behind your lines. He’ll take half the soldiers with him. None of them are that fond of you ‘suits’ anyway.*

“We lost a lot of good men, but we still have enough that you won’t be able to end this any time soon.” I held Koranti’s gaze and did my best not to tremble in anxiousness from the endeavor. “Your supply of mercs isn’t endless, you’ve easily spent billions on this project already, and I have a feeling that your buddies in D.C aren’t happy that this has taken so long. The fact is, our people are used to living with nothing, so I don’t have to last forever . . . I just have to outlast you.”

For a moment, his jaw worked back and forth, but Koranti didn’t waver. “There have been a few setbacks, true, but these are temporary. Thanks to you, I no longer have to deal with Riken’s plotting or McGregor’s psychotic benders. I have new units coming in every day, more than enough to replace my losses. You overestimate yourself, major. I think it’s time we bring this to an end.”

He waved his hand over one shoulder, and on command the riflemen around the helicopters began to drag out a line of shivering filthy men from the chinook. They were handcuffed, cloth bags over their heads, but I could tell from the ragged green uniforms they were ours. The mercenaries lined them up not far away, kneeling the captured men in the snow so that they faced the ridgeline where my men waited for orders.

As a unit, the soldiers drew back to level their rifles at the prisoners’ heads, and I caught the audible *click* of dozens of safety switches.

*I guess it’s now or never.*

I let my posture slouch, stuck a hand under my jacket, and palmed the cold metal of the launch panel. It had balanced just behind my shoulder blades, high enough where the mercs couldn’t see it as I initially lifted my jacket, and held in place by my uniform. The hidden string I’d pulled when taking out my papers loosened it enough that the panel dropped freely into my hand, and I placed it on my lap right in front of the men.

“Have it your way.” I scowled and flipped the first of the silver toggle switches.

*‘Launch code accepted; multiple reentry warhead systems armed: input target sequence command.’*

Confusion rippled across the faces of the delegates across from me, but I pushed the necessary command buttons in the sequence I’d memorized. It wasn’t Sean’s coordinates, but a new one of my own, and I had charted it hours prior from a Cold War target list that had been included with the panel.

*‘Target sequence authorized: Major target coordinates recognized as follows: San Diego, Atlanta, Columbus . . .”*

Koranti’s face paled slightly, and his dark eyes bored into mine with a mild astonishment. “What are you doing?”

*“. . . New York, Denver, San Antonio . . .”*

In my head, I saw Jamie’s face as she died, remembered how Chris kissed my neck in bed, and felt the hatred roil in my guts. Koranti had done that, took everything away from me, killed so many for ego, profit, power. He had more money and influence than some small nations, yet it would never be enough. The man wanted to be a savior, a defender of mankind, and if humanity wouldn’t accept his benevolent leadership, then he would *force* it on them. Chris, Jamie, they were just numbers, obstacles in George M. Koranti’s road to success. He didn’t care about their deaths. He didn’t care about anyone but himself.

Through all my life, I never hated anyone more.

Ears ringing with the memory of the screaming of prisoners in the Organ cells, I glared back as the pre-recorded female voice droned on in the background. “What I have to.”

His jawline tightened, and a bead of sweat broke out on Koranti’s otherwise well-kempt face. The two men flanking him bore worried looks, though the military man seemed more unnerved than the corporate suit did.

*“. . . Seattle, Boston, Norfolk . . .”*

Wearing a nervous half-grin that told me he didn’t understand the gravity of the situation, the suit to Koranti’s left looked at his comrades with hands spread in bewilderment. “Is this some kind of joke, or—”

“Shut up.” Impatient, Koranti snapped, and instead focused on me. “This won’t accomplish anything. My organization has bases all over the world.”

“*Exactly*.” I fought to keep my arms from shaking as the launch panel counted on and jabbed a finger at him with venomous satisfaction. “Except when the government realizes we’ve been attacked by someone they gave special privileges to, do you really think they’ll tell everyone it was their fault? No, that might trigger an uprising, and we *can’t* have that. Instead, they’ll cover their mistake by launching on our enemies, the Russians, the Chinese, *everyone.* They can’t risk not being strong enough to defend themselves, so every city in the world will burn, including the ones your organization is hiding in. Nowhere will be safe, and if your friends in the government survive, they will hunt you to the ends of the earth until there is no more ELSAR.”

Koranti’s expression hardened into something cold, a look that would have terrified me if we’d been back in his lavish headquarters and I still a prisoner. “Breach activity is triggered by shifts in radioactive or electromagnetic levels. If you detonate nuclear weapons all around the country, you’re only going to make it worse. Do you have any idea how many people will die?”

*“. . . Memphis, Philadelphia, Louisville . . .”*

That last name stuck in my chest like a knife blade, but I refused to move despite my brain begging me to push the *abort* button. My parents wouldn’t even know what hit them. They could never know as the fire rained from the sky that their deaths had been sent by their own daughter. How could they?

*Adonai give them a painless death.*

Drawing in a deep breath, I held his shark-like eyes and commanded my panicked brain to hold firm. “You can kill my men. You can kill me. But unless you agree to our terms, you have nothing to threaten me with.”

For a moment, he didn’t move, and it seemed Koranti had resigned himself to the idea that he’d been outfoxed.

“You know, Mrs. Dekker.” A cruel gleam flickered in Koranti’s eye, and he turned to signal his men once more. “In my experience, there is *always* something to threaten someone with. You just have to know where to look.”

From the chinook, another man was dragged through the snow to the firing line, and at Koranti’s nod, the soldiers yanked the black bag off his head.

*Oh God.*

My blood ran cold, and all the confidence I’d been able to muster drained. Koranti watched me with a wicked smile, and I knew I’d made a serious mistake.

Chris wore a blindfold over his eyes, bandages on his arms, head, and torso that spotted red with blood. From the bruises and cuts on his face, I figured my husband had put up a nasty fight, likely taking more than one auxiliary down with him. His nose was noticeably crooked, one of his ears ragged from either shrapnel or a knife, and his lips were split in multiple places so that crimson trickles ran down his chin. Thanks to his blindfold, he couldn’t see us, but from how Chris held himself in a rigid defiance, I figured he was waiting for the executioner’s bullet. My heart twisted at the sight of him sitting in the cold, stubbornly upright regardless of the rifle aimed at his head, and it made the air stick in both my lungs.

This couldn’t be happening.

“The problem with a *public* wedding is that the *public* will happily sell out both bride and groom for a warm meal or a trip across the border.” Koranti dropped all pretense of generous civility, his eyes aflame with malicious triumph. “Last chance, Hannah. Surrender, and we can put this whole ugly mess behind us. Or don’t . . . and I won’t hesitate to give the order.”

Frozen in place, I stared at Chris, feeling trapped, suffocated, unable to think. I hadn’t planned for this, hadn’t thought such a terrible situation was possible. Chris had been *dead*, I was so sure of it, and to see him alive made my chest feel ready to burst with terror. I couldn’t lose him again, not after what had happened to Jamie. I would go insane. Just the sight of his blood made my resolve melt like butter, and I wanted nothing more than to run to him.

“Come on.” Koranti angled his head, his words dripping with self-assurance. “It’s over, you know it is. Why lose another life for a hopeless cause?”

Jamie resurfaced in my mind, her mischievous wink, her laugh, her bravado at showing me her room on my first night at the reserve. They’d killed her, like they killed Bill, and would soon do the same to Chris. Kaba worked for them, and they tortured him for saving people. Tex dared to stand against them, and they shot him. Andrea offered a hand in peace, and they cut her down in the street. Koranti would have sold me if I hadn’t escaped him the first time, after doing God-knows-what to me in the name of ‘science.’ ELSAR couldn’t be trusted, which meant there was only one option left.

*Bravery is doing hard things for the good of others.*

“We all go home . . .” With one final glance at my husband, stuck my chin out in pride, and pushed the switch on the panel. “. . .or no one does.”

*‘Launch sequence initiated.’*

Shock rippled through the other side of the table, driven out next by a mute form of panic as the panel in my lap began to count down from thirty.

*‘twenty-nine . . . twenty-eight . . . twenty-seven . . .’*

The military man jumped to his feet, one hand on the pistol at his hip.

I leapt from my chair at the same time and drew the last hidden item from my coat with enough force to feel the little metal pin yank free. The padding fell away, having served its purpose, and the front of my uniform deflated to its natural state. For all their training, Koranti’s men hadn’t looked close enough, assuming my ‘stuffing’ was made of flesh and blood, not steel and TNT.

“Back up!” Thumb clamped down on the spool, I held the grenade out and felt a thousand rifle sights align on my head from multiple directions.

Everyone was on their feet now with the officer, the corporate man looking ready to faint, while Koranti held his arms out to restrain his men.

“Easy, easy.” He kept both eyes on me, adam’s apple in his throat bobbing with tension as Koranti gestured for his men to obey. “Hold your fire. Everyone just stay calm.”

“Let me take her down, sir.” The officer’s face had turned red, eyes wild, and I wondered if he might not shoot me despite Korati’s orders.

“You draw that gun and I’ll kill you myself.” The shadowy trillionaire ground his teeth and sized me up like a tiger ready to pounce.

Desperation and loathing mixed in the officer’s expression as he watched me, hand inches from his pistol. “My daughter is in Seattle. She’s three. Her name is Sophie.”

*Why couldn’t you just leave us alone, and stay with her?*

Recognizing the panic in his tone, I kept the live grenade between us but let sympathy soften my voice. “My parents are in Louisville. Their names are Allen and Margerie. I’m sorry for your loss.”

*‘ . . . eighteen . . . seventeen . . . sixteen . . .’*

The suit looked at Koranti and then back at me, sweat running over his flabby skin even in the cold wind. “It’s not real, right? This is fake, it has to be. She can’t be telling the truth . . .”

“For the last time, *shut up,* Martin.” Koranti growled and took a step forward to stand between his men and me. “Now, Hannah, you have to listen to me . . .”

“No, *you* listen.” With time running out, I shouted so that both he and his men couldn’t miss a word, my brain high on fear and adrenaline. “You’ve got three choices; you shoot me, I drop this, we all die, and the missiles still launch. You try to back out with Chris, and the same thing happens *or* . . . you do as I say, the launch aborts, and the world gets to wake up tomorrow. Your call.”

*‘. . .  thirteen . . . twelve . . . eleven . . .’*

He rested both hands on his hips, and Koranti let out a disbelieving snort. “You’d kill billions, just to prove a point? Is claiming victory worth murdering the world? Are you capable of that?”

I said nothing, but hated how true it rang in my head. Were we all that different, he and I? I’d found startling similarities between myself and Rodney Carter the more time had gone on and despised how much the man had been right about things. Perhaps Koranti was more of the same; a man who, despite my disdain for him, had read the room correctly from the start. Even if we accomplished our goal, even if I bullied him into leaving Barron County, it wouldn’t end his reign over the modern era. Koranti, and others like him, would always be there, pulling strings behind the scenes. If he was willing to wipe out Barron to get what he wanted, how could I claim to be so different holding the world hostage for my own reasons?

*‘. . . seven . . . six . . . five . . .’*

The pulse roared in my ear, the frigid winter gale stilled as if the world held its breath, and the two of us watched one another in stubborn silence. I imagined the meadow where Silo 48 lay erupting as the launch bay doors broke through the of dirt, massive steel and cement doors swinging open to make way for the salvo. If those missiles were launched, I would be the biggest murderer in all of human history. Could I live with myself, if somehow, I survived? Could Chris?

*Adonai, if this isn’t your will, I need to know now.*

Cold as ice in my hand, the grenade seemed to weigh a million pounds, the launch panel clasped against my side, a finger poised over the emergency stop button.

*‘. . . . three . . . two . . .’*

“Okay!” Koranti’s shoulders went slack, and I jammed my thumb hard against the emergency stop button.

*‘Launch sequence interrupted; release emergency switch to resume countdown or press abort toggle.’* The female voice quipped, and the countdown ceased.

For a long few seconds no one spoke, and Koranti let out a relieved sigh.

Picking up the papers I left on the table, he eyed them, then me. “If I do this, you won’t attempt to follow us? No missiles hurled at my men? No crossings at the perimeter?”

Finger ready to lift off the emergency button if he so much as flinched, I swallowed a dry lump in my throat. “If you stick to the terms, you have my word that within a week’s time, we won’t be a problem for you anymore.”

A strange flicker of curiosity moved over his lips, and Koranti nodded slowly. “No, I suspect you won’t be. I’d say it would be interesting to see where you end up but that’s assuming you make it there at all. Either way . . . we’re done here.”

With that, he tucked my terms into his pocket, pivoted on one heel, and Koranti marched back toward his helicopter. The confused suit and military man followed him, only to be shooed away when they tried to ask more questions. Together they rejoined the line of soldiers, and at a word from Koranti, the men lowered their weapons.

For my part, I backed up to the trees with grenade in hand, the launch panel close to my chest, watching as the guards stood their prisoners up one by one. The ELSAR men kept the blindfolds on their charges but herded them toward our tree line until the bound men staggered single file toward us. Only after the last of them crossed into the safety of our positions did I bother to hit the *abort* switch on the launch panel and listened to the device power down with bated breath. The release pin had been sewn into the inside of my jacket, and it took me six tries to get it fit back into the hole atop the grenade’s fuse. As soon as it was safe, I leaned against a nearby tree while my head swam.

One second. We’d been one second away from total oblivion.

*There’s no way that should have worked.*

The last man stumbled into our hidden cloister, and at the sight of him, my legs moved on their own. “*Chris.*”

His body went rigid at the sound, and Chris swiveled his blindfolded head around to search for me. “Hannah?”

Breathless, I threw myself on him, tore at the plastic flexicuffs on his wrists until I remembered the knife at my belt. With his bonds cut, I pulled the blindfold from my husband’s face, unable to stop until I could see him as he was.

Chris’s jaw went slack but he tightened both arms around me so that I thought my ribs would crack. “We’ve got to stop meeting like this, *pragtige.*”

*You have no idea.*

Helpless against the wave of emotion rising from inside myself, I choked back a sniffle and ran my hands over him, in search of wounds that needed care. “A-Are you . . . I didn’t know if . . . what did they do?”

Chris’s exhausted laugh tickled my ear with warmth, and he pressed cracked lips to my forehead in a way that riveted me to the ground. “Nothing an ice pack won’t fix. Are you okay? What happened?”

“I sealed the pass.” Too scared to let go for risk that I might wake up to it all being a dream, I gripped his dirty uniform with both hands. “Koranti agreed to leave, and most of our people went south, but Sean . . . he and his men didn’t make it. We’re all that’s left from the ridgeline.”

His blue eyes took in the ragged band around us with disappointed sadness, and Chris let out a weary sigh. “Better some than none. Most of mine didn’t make it either. Where’s Jamie?”

*‘Take care of him.’*

Her words rang in my head, as painful as the day Jamie walked out the gates of Ark River, and I buried my face in Chris’s lapel to hide my tears. “She’s gone.”

Chris said nothing, but from the way he stroked my hair, I knew it hit him just as hard. Safe at last in his arms, I let myself break again, and we stood hidden beneath the pines as the rumble of the helicopters faded into the distance. The sun came up over the valley with long streaks of gold, red, and orange. A few birds began to sing, and the last of the guns went quiet in the distance to leave behind the whisper of a gentle December breeze.

Morning came, and with it . . . peace.

Peace at last.
