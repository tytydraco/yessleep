I went to check on my ImmerseTech virtual reality headset after about half an hour of charging. 36% *This should last at least a few hours.* I thought to myself and grabbed the headset to play some Beat Saber. *I'll use it until it runs out of power.*

After about what felt like 4 hours, I was expecting it to turn off by any minute. I was starting to get bored, and it was getting late, so I turned the headset off and went over to the charging port. When I plug the headset in, it displayed the percentage it was at, like it usually was. But instead of saying something like 5% it was at... 100%? It gained percentage just from me wearing it?

I was really tired, so I didn't think much of it, and went to sleep after a quick snack. The day after that, the day I'm writing this, I have a bad headache. It isn't painful or anything, but I'm feeling very tired and hungry. I've had this headset for nearly a year now, and this is the only time something like this has happened. What gives?

I'll post an update if more strange things like this happen.

UPDATE:

My headache hasn't gotten better since I've waken up. I feel like I can't think straight without my mind zoning off and thinking about the headset. I could fall asleep any minute now, and it's not even 7 PM yet.

UPDATE:

I woke up this morning feeling disoriented. I feel no less exhausted than the night before, as if I haven't slept at all. I fell asleep at around 8, and just woke up a few minutes ago around 2 PM. 18 hours of sleep and I still feel tired. I'm going to reach out to the company's customer support to see if they have any explanation for the sudden changes in the headset's behavior. In the meantime, I'll keep a close eye on any further developments and update you all accordingly.

UPDATE:

I feel a sudden urge to put on the headset. It isn't like a "Oh I feel like hopping on VR right now." It's more of a "I *need* to wear the headset." It's like a parasite is inside of my mind. There's no parasite in my mind, right?

UPDATE:

I hesitantly decided to try the VR headset once more. I placed it on my head, and as the familiar virtual landscape unfolded, I felt a chill running down my spine. The virtual world seemed different this time. The colors were more vivid, and the atmosphere felt unusually immersive. It was as if the headset became more powerful. After about 30 minutes I couldn't take it anymore and took off the headset. The battery was still at 100%. My headache only feels worse after using the headset. I'm going to sleep again, even if it doesn't do anything about my headache.

UPDATE:

I had a strange dream last night. I was playing on the VR headset, when I encountered a tall, thin purple figure, standing at about 10 feet away from me. It disappeared the second I looked at it. And then I woke up immediately after, feeling fatigued. I feel no motivation to do anything besides VR. I can hear the headset calling my name, beckoning me to put it on. Are these hallucinations, or are they real? It doesn't matter, because I'm never going to put that thing on again.

UPDATE:

I woke up to myself wearing the headset, playing Beat Saber. I couldn't remember putting it on, but there I was, slashing through virtual blocks in a trance-like state. I must have done it in my sleep. I took the headset off immediately. I'm not sure if I'm losing control or if something is controlling me through this cursed device. My headache is pounding, and I can't shake off the feeling of being watched, even when the headset is off.  The purple figure from my dream is a constant presence in this digital landscape, taunting me with its eerie silence. I can feel its gaze on me all the time, even in the real world.

UPDATE:

I woke up wearing the headset again, playing a game I didn't even know existed. Panic surged through me as I frantically tried ripping the headset off, but it wouldn't budge. I waited a few seconds to catch my breath, and tried to pull it off again. No use. Desperation set in as I struggled to free myself from the headset's grip. The more I resisted, the tighter it became. It was as if the device had fused with my head, merging the lines between reality and the virtual realm. Am I trapped in this virtual hellscape now?

UPDATE:

I haven't left my room since I've posted my last update. I don't even eat or sleep anymore, but somehow I haven't died. The headset knows that death is an escape from its torture, I think it's keeping me alive somehow. This headset has enslaved me. I am nothing more than a puppet for the headset to toy with. My brain has turned to mush, I can't escape into the real world. This is probably going to be my last update. Maybe I'll find a way to kill myself, to put myself out of my misery. But I don't think the headset will let me do that.
