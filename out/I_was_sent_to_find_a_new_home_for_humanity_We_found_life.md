Entry 1
Hello, I'm Dr. Erikson. I'm aboard the CSV-101 Columbus. If anyone ever reads this, here's my story.

I was born in 3010, in Norway — that's right, I'm pushing 40 now. I got my PhD at Arrington, and that's probably the main reason I was chosen for this program. We're tasked with finding a new planet where humanity can survive.

After World War III, a lot of problems snowballed us into this situation. The only good thing that came out of the war was the leap in technology. I wasn't alive to see it, but I heard stories from my grandfather.

The point is: we can't afford to fail this mission.

There are about 30 people on the ship with me, most of them here to assist with research and scouting the planets we might land on. Aaron Gladwin is the captain of the ship. He knows a bit of everything, but he’s more of a militaristic type. I believe he's well-versed in engineering, but I'm not familiar with him yet.

My assistant, Jamie Wong, seems hopeful — she's one of those optimistic types. It's a good change, I think. Sometimes I wish I could believe in our success as much as she does.

Entry 2
We made it to our first planet after a month.

Dr. Wong has become somewhat of a friend. At least I have someone to share my thoughts with. But I should get straight to the point:

We found life.

It looks like some kind of plant — but its color is strange. It’s a pale beige tone, almost like aged parchment. But what unsettled me most is its texture… it looks flesh-like.

When the exploration team returned — an hour later — they looked… older. Not just tired. Aged.

I feared something like this might happen…

We still need to study this “plant” and see what we can learn from it. For now, that’s all I can say.

Entry 3
I examined the crew that came back. Patel seems to be the least affected. I swear he was in his twenties... now he looks about my age. Gray hair at the sides, crow’s feet around his eyes, a receding hairline, muscle loss — and some memory slippage.

The worst, by far, is Alvarez. He was in his thirties. Now he looks like my grandfather. Maybe he stayed longer than the others? He’s shorter, his hair is wispy and white, his eyes dull and gray. He has significant memory gaps — he knows where he is and what his job is, but he can’t remember his own birthday. He can’t remember his daughter. He’s just an old man now.

The other three are affected to a lesser extent, but the changes are definitely visible.

Extra:
Last night, I heard a tune. A soft humming in the corridor — almost mechanical at first. Repetitive and slightly off-tempo, like a lullaby someone half-remembers. It was... unnerving. I should look into it. I can’t just wait for the worst. If I find something, I’ll write it here. If I can.

Captain Gladwin was stern but reasonable at first. Now he’s become paranoid. He caught me writing in this personal log and asked why I was doing it. I said it was for “research,” but he just walked off. I could still feel his eyes on me long after he left — that heavy stare. There’s more to all this. I just hope I’m not changing too.

Entry 4
Even though Gladwin refused to let us examine the plant, we eventually convinced him. He said we were all “changing.” He even got physical with one of my team members — he’s cooling off in his chambers now.

I remember how my brother used to get in fights... until he couldn’t anymore. His recklessness caught up with him. He’s the lucky one. Times are grim. I thought getting away from everything would help me forget — or at least take the weight off my back — but I only feel heavier. Like I might sink.

We took samples from the plant, then dissected it.

I can’t describe what we found with full accuracy, but I’ll try my best.

Its skin was pale beige — flesh-like, slightly translucent under bright light.
Veins pulsed faintly with a dull amber fluid, viscous like tree sap — but warm.
The surface was textured like plucked skin, or stretched parchment.

Beneath the outer layer, there was no plant fiber. Instead, we found a wet mesh of tubular cartilage — almost skeletal in structure, but not quite human.

The internal "organs" were soft, glistening, and colorless. One of them inflated and deflated like a lung, even after separation.
Another section held brittle plates, arranged like ribs — but not in a chest cavity. They encased a jelly-like sac filled with floating, shifting fragments that looked like teeth. Human teeth — but wrong.
Too many roots. No enamel.

It feels more like an animal than a plant. I can’t explain why, but something in my mind insists it’s sentient. I've never seen anything like it. Our only hope to understand is through the samples, now under testing.

I tried to cool off. Tried to rationalize what I saw. There must be a reason for the plant to have that kind of structure.
But when you imagine aliens... a flesh-plant isn’t what comes to mind.

Later, I heard the tune again.
Wong was humming it — the exact same melody I heard in the corridor. Eyes locked to her microscope. She didn’t even realize she was doing it.

When I asked what it was, she paused — confused — and said:

"I don’t know. I’ve had it stuck in my head since yesterday. I thought you were the one humming it."

Like some sick joke, Gladwin began forcing everyone to wear earplugs. He now wears his all the time.
Should I do the same? I was skeptical at first. Now... I’m not so sure.
Should I report my findings? I fear it’ll make Gladwin worse.
But maybe I’m the one who’s wrong.

Entry 4.5
The DNA test came back.

The results are… impossible.

The sample’s cellular structure includes eukaryotic cells with human-like organelles — mitochondria, nuclei... even faint signs of neural signaling.

I read the computer’s summary report. Just one line:

"Genetic match: 92.3% — Homo sapiens sapiens."  

Entry 5
The DNA analysis changed everything. Even Daniels, our religious officer, couldn’t cope. He kept repeating verses from the Bible, whispering that the plant was “Adam’s other rib.”
It’s been a week now, and I haven’t seen him since.

But what really keeps me awake is the 7.7% of the genome that remains undetectable. I’ve never encountered anything like it.
I’ve labeled it MN-0 — the unknown genome.
Whatever it is, it’s the root cause of this… thing. This "plant."

I debated with Dr. Wong, who proposed that it might be the mutated remains of an astronaut — a long-lost body warped by cosmic exposure. But that doesn't make sense. There haven’t been any deep-space expeditions for decades, possibly centuries.
I want to dismiss her theory. But the truth is, I don’t know what to believe anymore.

Earlier today, I confronted Gladwin. He’s been a ticking bomb since we brought that thing onboard.
The following conversation is my best recollection:

E: Why do you keep avoiding the lab? And the holding bay?
G: I’ve seen where it leads.
E: What? I need your help here. No one seems to be in their right mind anymore. If we don’t bring stability back to this ship, all of this effort will be for nothing.
G: You don’t understand. You got exposed. You changed.
E: It’s dead. Whatever that thing was — whatever way it had to reach us — it’s gone now.
G: All those roots… it’ll grow through us again.
E: Snap out of it. It’s gone. For good. Please — just level with me here.
G: Maybe you’ll forget. For a while.
E: This isn’t leading me anywhere. We are lost. The captain is broken — and soon, the ship will be too.
G: Stay away from Wong…

I escalated the situation. I punched him.

I’d never hit anyone before. I’ve always been non-confrontational — the kind of person who needed protection.
If I hadn’t been so weak back then, maybe I could’ve saved M.

But in that moment, I felt pushed.
Gladwin was the only one in direct communication with Command. If he went down completely, we’d be severed from Earth.
What was I supposed to do?

In the end, he beat the crap out of me. I’m okay — nothing broken. Just a bruised cheek, a bleeding lip, and a pathetic sense of failure.
I fought a delirious man and lost.

Wong helped patch me up. She didn’t ask what happened. She just hummed while disinfecting the wound.

I was going through the security footage, trying to see if Daniels had ever come out of his chamber.
Nothing from Daniels.

But I found something worse.

I found footage of Wong working late in the lab. In the recording, she never moved her lips — not even once.
That’s… deeply concerning, because the audio captured the same humming.
The same goddamn hum.

We killed that thing. We dissected it. Its parts are still sealed away for future studies. I was sure it was gone.

I know what I have to do next, but it pains me:
I have to put Dr. Wong into lockdown — away from the others — and study her.

Entry 6

It’s funny — I never wrote about my relationship with Dr. Wong. With Jamie…

She was the first person to reach out and talk to me.
Most of the crew members who worked under me felt "intimidated." I don’t look like a friendly person.
But Jamie never shied away from people, I guess.

It’s an odd feeling — treating someone like an experiment. Like a hostile creature.
I know she’s scared of planes, even though we’re in space, on a massive ship.
I know she used to be a horse girl.
I know how she takes her coffee — with salt. Says it “enhances the flavor.”

This is the worst time to be thinking about her like this, but I feel guilty.
I know I didn’t cause this — not directly — but I feel… wrong.
Still, I have to keep going.

Today we entered Daniels’ chamber. He’d hanged himself — the first crew member to perish.
We had to dispose of the body. It’s a horrible thing.
I’ve always felt that a person’s body is their final farewell — the last gift for their family, something to bury with what honor they have left.
But protocol is protocol.
If I end up dead, my body will meet the same fate.

We kept his notes.
I’m not religious, and I’m not familiar with theology, but I’ll do what I can to try and understand.
It feels pointless — or outright stupid — to search through the last words of a desperate man.
It’s unlikely I’ll find anything.

The only good news is that Gladwin seems better.
He remembers fragments of what happened during these past few days — or months.
I feel like time is warping around me.

I’m not certain, but I suspect Wong caused Gladwin to become delirious.
Now she’s sealed away in a soundproof observation room.
We can see her through the one-way mirror, but she can’t see us.
That’s probably for the best.

She seems sane. For now.

We’re approaching our next destination — a planet and its moons.
This time, we’ll scout the surface.
Maybe we’ll find something useful.
Or maybe we’ll just find more roots.
