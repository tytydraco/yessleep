So i was playing superhot, which is a first person shooter game where the enemies are red dudes with few polygons. Also, the game has a unique mechanic where time only moves when you move.

 anyways, i was on the "Break in" level where you fall through the ceiling, i kept losing and losing and losing over and over again. that's when i saw something odd, there was a blue dude in the far corner of the main room where most the enemies are.  
  
Then i noticed there were no enemies, and i couldn't pick anything up, or even attack. Freaked out by this I went over to the blue dude, he was just a recoloured red dude, however he wasn't hostile. The blue dude then gave a creepy grin. I was extremely freaked out and closed the game in panic, I only thought one thing, how did he grin?  
  
The next day i booted up superhot hesitantly. I loaded into the level and the blue dude was gone, thinking it was some sort of dream or nightmare I continued playing, however a few levels later i loaded into an empty room, no enemies, no decor, nothing. Except for the blue dude, i backed away from him as i wasn't able to attack again.  
  
The blue dude slowly approached, grinning like the last time, i was horrified at this as time is only supposed to move when i move, how is he moving??? i tried to close the game but it wouldn't work, not even alt f4 or task manager worked, then i noticed my character couldn't move. When the blue guy got closer I began to hear something, he was saying "Super Hot." over and over and over.  
  
I took off my headphones but I could still hear it, I began to think I was going insane. That's when the most horrifying thing happened: my player character began to burn, letting out screams that sounded human, yet were not. The blue guy watched and titled his still grinned head as he clapped to the sight of my character burning. I noticed i began to sweat like crazy, like I was outside during the summer, but i was inside, on the 3rd of December.  
  
I continued to sweat like crazy, like i was beginning to melt or something..., listening to the Blue dude continue to mumble "Super hot" over and over, alongside my player character's screams. I turned off my computer and the whispers stopped, i began to breathe deeply to calm myself down and cool myself off from that traumatic experience. I Haven't played the game since, afraid of the blue dude.  
  
I then managed to get into the superhot files and what I found: or the lack of thereof, scared me half to death... There was no "Blue guy" in the code, no models, no textures, not even any references to a blue guy.  
  
I'm only posting this to ask if anyone else has seen the phenomenon i can only describe as the "Blue dude". If you want to play the game superhot, just be aware of the dangers of this blue guy, and if you see him. **Close the game and never open it again.** There's only one thing on my mind, what would've happened if i didn't turn off my computer in time...
