   Let’s start with **the cocaine van.** One morning Mr. Boss came to work with his van full of coolers each containing cups of worms, which usually meant we had been sitting there in the shack anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour, since our day typically started knowing the amount of worms we’d be packing that day, which he usually tells us in the morning after he pulls up, or in a text if he is running unusually late, or sometimes we’d wait around for an hour and then be sent home. The van appeared outside next to the open front door of the shack as it started reversing. First thing in the morning we would either unload or load the van…today was loading. After he backed up into the gravel driveway, and opened the back doors, **the floor was covered in white powder, and his forehead was smeared with the same substance once he got out of the driver's seat.** All of us glared at him, but said nothing directly to him about it since…well what was there to say?   **It was situations like this** that inspired me to write about this place. I remember we wanted to film at work in our downtime because we figured it would be fun to make something creative using this shack. I wanted it to be called “WORMS”, and had many working hours where I would daydream about what would be an insane documentary or fictional show about this place, but the boss vetoed that since the property was supposedly really hard to get and that it was technically private property.

   The bosses tended to find people at small local churches to work for them. At first, I didn't think this was **an issue**, but when I realized that I myself was a homeschooled church goer, I was the perfect demographic for that place, because I could go to work, come back home, and then do my schoolwork. **Suffice to say those days were the most stressful.** Mr. Boss told me one day as I was waiting around to always be busy doing something. At first I thought it was good advice **but it later manifested into always feeling guilty when I wasn’t doing something, even in my present day life.** In the short term however, we had to sweep out all the dirt out of the door every single day, which in retrospect I’m not sure if that’s **technically littering** or not. 

   **The cocaine van** wasn’t the first instance where something **uncanny** like this has happened. This job was the first place I saw **dead bodies.** Whenever we had worms **die**, due to being **too old** or not getting used, we had to scrap it out of either big white Styrofoam containers, or what we call “flats” which were essentially big flat shallow stone pans with the “worm knife”, which was a trowel, or if the **dead** worms were really stuck to the bottom of these containers, since **dead** worms turn into **one of the worst liquids I have ever witnessed**, we’d occasionally use a shelf bracket that was laying around to scrape the bottom. This was the worst part of the job that nobody warns you about. Whether it was the day the fridge went bad and we scooped out **several plates of melted worms, the nitro worms that were just constantly dead, or the time the leaf worms drowned, it smelled indescribable, to the point where we would almost throw up at how bad it reeked. I genuinely cannot compare it to anything I have ever sniffed before.** After this **horrific** incident, Mrs. Boss, The boss's wife, who also owned this business, brought brownies to the shack and put them on the makeshift janky table composed of laid down broken doors and sawhorses. On the surface, this seemed rather innocent, however, **she then cut the brownies with that dirty shelf bracket. I felt sick to my stomach, especially when she then tried to go get the “worm knife” to use instead,** and that’s when we stopped her from causing further damage by suggesting against that. At least it wasn’t as bad as those **expired** donuts she brought in one time.
