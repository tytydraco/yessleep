Maurice, Oscar, and George are three of, if not the most frequent customers at the movie theater I’ve worked at for the last five years. In fact, they’re there every single day, more than the staff. How is this possible? Well, George, Oscar, and Maurice are the names of the three ghosts that inhabit the place. I’ll go over each of them in order of least to most annoying. If there’s any upside to having this many ghosts running around, at least they’re all harmless. Annoying, yes, but I don’t think they’ve harmed anyone. 

First off is Maurice. His full name is actually ‘Grandpa Maurice’, and the story is that in the early 2000’s, an old man came to see a horror movie and ended up passing away during the movie, being found by the cleaning crew after the movie ended. I still don’t know how nobody in the theater noticed, but I guess that’s beyond the point.

Maurice is the most harmless of all our ghosts, in the sense that he doesn’t try to interact with us. He’ll give you really intense feelings of being watched when you’re alone in a theater. He’ll also appear out of the corner of your eye, seeming like a customer in an otherwise empty theater. Personally I’ve found that saying, “Good morning, Maurice!” when opening in the mornings prevents too many incidents with him.

Oscar is a little more intense than Maurice. I don’t know where Oscar came from, but he’s named after the Grouch on Sesame Street. He got that name because he hangs out in the trash hall, where we keep our bins and cans before taking it all out for the night. Every so often Oscar gets, well, grouchy, and will move the cans that are lined up back there. Let me tell you, it never stops being frustrated walking into the hall and finding that the cans are now everywhere, and there’s more often than not trash on the floor.

Moving cans is one thing, but Oscar will also mess with the service elevator in the back hallway too. Every so often while emptying a bag of trash, I’ll hear the elevator activate, come back up (we’re on the 2nd floor), and open. Every single time this happens, footsteps can be heard stepping out of the elevator. 

Now you may be saying “Aren’t you in a movie theater? Couldn’t it just be footsteps in a movie?” No. Every single time, it’s two very distinct clunks on the concrete floor. Sometimes the sounds get closer, and right when they’re about to round the corner to get to where the bins are, they stop. As far as I know, there’s no way to counter Oscar, other than pray he’s in a good mood.

Lastly, there’s George. To put it bluntly, George is just an ass. Like Oscar, I have no idea where he came from, I also have no idea how he got the name George. George will run around the theater causing all sorts of problems. From burst pipes when they were just checked, to the paper towels in the dispensers going missing moments after being filled, to lights flashing once during a movie and then going dark again, and much more. 

The most memorable encounter with George was around Christmas 2022. We usually had a big cardboard standee for a movie behind the podium, where customers scan their tickets to see the movie. I was training this new girl at the podium, and we were discussing the weird things that go on, as it had slowed down. She said something along the lines of “Ghosts? Yeah, I don’t believe in those”. Moments later, the standee tipped over. It was one of the big, thicker standees too, not just a thin piece of cardboard. 

“Did you do that?” she asked, thinking I had done it to scare her. I shook my head. I know how difficult those things were to set up, not to mention heavy, so pushing one over as a joke would have likely cost me my job. 

“I see you met George”, was all I could respond with. There was nobody else in the lobby, and the AC vent in the ceiling wasn’t able to move a standee that large. 

I’m still at that theater today, and yes, the three are just as active as ever. Maybe I'll write another entry if one of the three does anything else worth writing about.
