(I highly recommend reading Part 1 on my profile before reading this.)


Hello all, I want to thank those who read my previous statement and are back to read more of my findings. For those who didn't read my previous post, I am a research agent for an organisation that I'm not allowed to name, and I've been given permission to post (albeit censored) statements of some of my findings. 

I am doing this in the hopes that, well, something will be left of me if I don't keep ahead of what's hunting me.

Anyways, the story begins a few months after the bus incident. Me and Lily were being punished for using a very rare and very expensive piece of equipment, and our punishment was what we like to call in the biz “campfire duty”.

My organisation specialises in the investigation and regulation of any and all paranormal entities, sites or events; we have our ear to the ground and finger in every pie. This makes it so we are capable of investigating as many myths or legends as possible to verify if they're genuine.

This also includes all of the stories that are clearly made up and are told to spook teenagers; this is campfire duty. And it's horribly embarrassing. 

I won't go into what we investigated, but to anyone who likes spreading urban legends about ghosts that appear when you drive along roads late at night, I hope you realise how much time you waste for some poor research agent who actually has to drive up and down that road for hours multiple nights a week.

It was early in the morning when I first got to work, an unlabelled office building in a part of a central business district that you'd never notice. I had a coffee in my hand and a filled-out dossier in the other; it was for an urban legend that could finally be filed under “Myth”. I got to my desk cubicle and discovered that another dossier was left on my keyboard.

A new assignment before I even submitted the one in my hands, I finished the coffee and sat in my chair to begin reading.

“The Shadow Man” was a Type A Spectre who roams around the halls of a “Springview motel”. This was shaping up to be another campfire case, but you have to do what you have to do.



A few hours later, Lily and I were driving down a highway in the middle of an empty open field that stretched out indefinitely. 

“I’m sick of this, Lily. If they want us running around chasing chickens, they should at least make them interesting. This shadow man," I said, almost scoffing when saying the name, "doesn't even sound original," I continued. 

"If you hate it so much, why don't you leave?" she responded in a nonchalant tone. I often forgot that our roles within the organisation were very different. I was free to complain about the assignments I'd been put on, and I was also free to quit at any time. Lily didn't have that freedom.

It was a good question, one I didn't have an answer to. Before things got awkward, we pulled off of the road and into the car park of a nice-looking motel. 

"Y'know, in terms of chickens to chase, this doesn't seem that bad; it might even just be an all-expenses-paid holiday," Lily said with a slight sense of excitement in her voice. 

We got out of the car and walked to the entry of the motel. Sitting behind the front desk was an early twenties guy playing something on his phone. I walked up and placed my hand on the counter. 

"Hi, we've got two rooms booked under a Mr Moore," I said. The staff member looked up at me from his phone and had a visibly annoyed look. 

"Yeah, let me check," he said slowly as he shifted to the computer beside him. After a moment, he scanned some keycards and placed them on the desk. "Please enjoy your stay," he added before jumping back onto his phone.

We walked up a flight of stairs and found our rooms. They were next to each other like always; it was the usual setup: twin-sized bed, desk, small kitchenette and bathroom.

I set my bag at the foot of the bed and took a seat atop it. I had my dossier in my hands and read over the specifics: a "Shadowman" would appear when you least expect and take people. I groaned at the cheesiness. A few hours had passed, and the sun had long since set. Lily was in my room, and we were, for all intents and purposes, just shooting the shit.

We had ordered pizza, and Lily had driven out and bought some beer; to be fair to her, things were shaping up to just being a vacation paid for by the organisation. something we both desperately needed.

Eventually Lily called it a night, and I got into some pyjamas and went into the bathroom to brush my teeth. The bathroom wasn't the best, but I've also been in worse. Imagine a shitty tub and shower curtain, a brown toilet and a sink with a mirror-shelf cabinet just above it.

I wet my toothbrush and began to scrub my teeth. I spat my spit back into the sink and looked in the mirror and realised something: there was a handprint on the other side of the shower curtain.

My heart sank, but I remembered my training. I turned around and kept my eyes on it. The handprint was slowly moving closer, as if whoever was on the other side was reaching out to me. 

"Shit," I whispered in an instinctual slip. 

As I said this, Silent black flames burst from behind the shower curtain, licking up the walls. No heat. No light. Just darkness moving like fire. I ran to the door and almost threw myself through it. I dove for my bag. The bathroom was an inferno of silent abyss, black fire licking the air. dancing atop each other, whilst a man made of black flames stepped out from behind the shower curtain slowly. 

"FUCK!" I remember screaming at the top of my lungs as the shadow man turned its head towards me. I grabbed out a small bag of silver halide, poured it into my hand, and threw it at the shadow man, but it fell through him. 

The black flames had begun to spread into my motel room, and I began to run to my motel door. As I reached for the door, the flames shot up the doorframe, and I jumped at the sudden movement. The flames remained silent, and the sound of my heart beating may very well have been the loudest thing in the room.

As the shadow man advanced, my breath caught in my throat. Suddenly, the motel door slammed open. Lily burst inside, her hands thrust forward like a shield. The dark figure recoiled, its fiery form folding in on itself, retreating back into the bathroom’s shadows. 

Lily was swooning on her feet, and I leapt forward to grab her as she fell, and I dragged us both out of the room. I dragged her to her car, and as soon as we entered, she fell asleep. I was in no mood to re-enter the motel room, so I joined her. 



The next morning we got breakfast at a diner a few minutes' drive down the road. It was awkward and tense, but I thought we needed to debrief about our situation.

"So what do you think that was last night?" I asked sheepishly. 

"The fucking shadowman, I guess," she responded before taking a deep sip of her orange juice. I took note that it wasn't coffee. 

"How did you know to come and help me? The fire wasn't hot or noisy. I know I shouted a bit, but surely not that loud," I said as jokingly as I could, which rewarded me with a smile. 

"First off, yeah, you do scream that loud; secondly, I don't know how I couldn't have felt it. It felt like a bomb went off in my head," she finished with a head shake. "Whatever this is, Elijah is strong," she continued, which I shook my head in agreement with. 

"Yeah, it didn't even flinch at a handful of silver halide," I confessed. 

She looked at me again. "How many things do you know that can do that?" she asked, already knowing the answer.

"Not many, not your usual type A spectre at least," I said. A waitress walked up to our table and placed our breakfasts in front of us: eggs on toast with a side of beans for me and banana pancakes for Lily. I must've been giving her a look because she spoke up and said, "Shut up. The last time I had to use that much energy was when we were on the bus, coincidentally when I was saving your ass again." 

I shot her a playful look and took a sip of my coffee. 

"Okay, so type A are just basic apparitions, right?" Lily said in inbetween mouthfulls of pancakes.  

"Yeah, usually your normal ghost archetype, humanoid, glowing, translucent," I said whilst cutting my toast. 

"Right," she said whilst pointing a fork at me; the fork had a banana on the end of it. 

"Elijah, that thing only fell under one of those; it's a stretch to call it a type A, and it's nowhere near a type P," she added.

"Ok, so what are you saying? This is something new?" I said, confused, 

"No, not at all. In this line of work you'll learn that there is never anything new, just things we haven't learnt of yet. What I'm saying is that I don't think this thing comes from a soul like a spectre would; I think it's something else," she added before chewing down another mixture of banana, pancake, chocolate and orange juice. 

"Ok, so what do you propose?" I asked. 

"I don't know at the moment; I have some questions I want to ask, like why did it target you on the very first night?, Usually they spend as much time scoping us out as we scope them, but we have to practise the Heinz tried-and-true method of throwing whatever we have at it night after night until we understand that bastard," she said before presenting her newly finished plate of pancakes.  


Eight long, excruciating nights of nothing; the Shadowman had gone silent, and if it wasn't for Lily also seeing him, I would've begun to believe that I imagined the whole thing. I couldn't help but feel that throughout those long 8 nights a sense of being watched, like I had never felt like I was truly alone in that place.

I felt more comfortable being alone within the motel, and I was allocated the very noble role of "vending machine trader", which meant I'd just go and get us snacks whenever we were both hungry. I honestly think that motel may have seen more revenue from their vending machine in the time we were there than the entire time they were open. 

We'd both seen flickers of black flames appearing and disappearing throughout this period of time, but we both couldn't confidently say if it was reality or a trick conjured by our minds; living off of fumes you don't have and rarely sleeping can do cruel things to your psyche. In my line of work, trusting what your gut tells you is real is incredibly important, so I can't genuinely say if the black embers were real or not. It doesn't really impact much, I guess. 

I didn't sleep much that week; the times when I did sleep, I would need to borrow Lily's car and drive somewhere else. For the time I did try to sleep in the motel, I dreamt of the flames and the Shadowman. He was engulfed in the silent fire, and he was always wanting something from me, but I could never guess what. Lily woke me up before anything happened and began to sleep in her car.

I was on vending machine duty on the ninth night of our investigation, and I passed the staff member behind the front desk. He was playing on his phone like usual and didn't acknowledge me, like usual. It was past 2 a.m.; I couldn’t blame him for looking half-dead. I grabbed a bottle of cola and chips and grabbed Lily her cookies and mineral water. 

After the drinks popped out, I realised that the hair on my arms was standing up and I had a gut feeling that something was wrong, which in my line of work is a good indicator that something is wrong. I shot my head up and looked around me and saw it: the staff member behind the front desk was slumped back in his chair, and he was being engulfed in a quiet black flame… In one moment he was there, and the next it had consumed him whole; he was gone. 

"Dammit!" I shouted and dropped the supplies from the vending machine. I ran immediately to the stairs that led to the motel rooms to meet back up with Lily. As I reached the bottom of the stairs, I stepped into a dark spot in the room. It was 2 am, so it didn't look out of place, but as I stepped into it, I realised my mistake. A black arm made of fire shot out and gripped me by the throat and pulled me into the darkness, and everything went numb. 

I was falling in the darkness, although it wasn't dark; I could make out each black ember around me in crisp detail, and I felt like I was experiencing everything through a state of tunnel vision and extreme focus. 

I felt confused and foggy about what was happening, and I remember an extreme feeling of calm whilst I fell in this world of fire. 

Suddenly my calm was disturbed by a flickering of light. I looked towards it, and it seemed to peel back the fire around it. I could see the silhouette of someone in that light, but I couldn't recognise who.

"Elijah…" the voice cried out.

"Elijah, please…" it continued.

It took me a second to realise that it was talking about me. , 

"Elijah, come to me please, for God's sake," the voice cried out once more.

I trusted the voice, and although I was falling, I felt the strength to move. I tried to swim in this abyss, and to my shock, I was able to move closer to the light. 

"Yes, Elijah, keep coming," the voice shouted before crying out in pain. Suddenly the fire violently swarmed around the light, and I felt a resounding amount of hate from all around me. The silhouette dropped to her knees, and I continued to push myself forward even though it had become much harder. 

I reached the ever-shrinking light and thrust my hand out and let it engulf me. In a moment I was in that realm of fire, and in the next I was at the motel lobby being flung across the room. Lily was flung a few feet away from me, and she looked exhausted. I looked towards the shadow that I had come out from and saw the Shadowman stepping out; silent black flames erupted off of him, and he seemed much angrier now. With every step flames shot out from his foot and infected the surrounding area; he was engulfing the entire motel. The air was cold despite the flames, and a faint smell of burnt sulfur filled my nostrils.

I got to my feet and ran to Lily. She was awake but not entirely well. I scooped her up and ran out of the lobby, the Shadowman not far behind us. As we reached her car, I threw her into the back seat and dived for the steering wheel. 

I tried to turn on the ignition but froze as I realised that I didn't know where her keys were. 

"FUCK!" I shouted as I scrambled my hands all across her car to find her keys. After a moment, I looked up and saw it. The Shadow Man stood across the car park from us. I was terrified. We stared at one another for what felt like an eternity, then it clicked: he isn't moving. 

He was bound to the motel, ofcourse how stupid could I be?

As I was thinking this, a spiky object hit the back of my head. I yelped in fear before looking down and seeing that they were Lily's car keys; she had thrown them at me. A second later we were speeding out of that parking lot and making our way into town. 


The next morning we were back at the diner; I had my eggs, toast and beans, and Lily had her pancakes.

"So you just happened to step into the one shadow the Shadow Man was hiding in." Lily said in a teasing voice, "You really are the stupidest research agent in the history of research agents," she said before taking a scoop of ice cream and eating it. Today she asked for ice cream as well as banana pancakes as a reward for saving my life again.

"Yeah, and what happened to you, oh great hero?" I said in a similarly mocking tone.

"Simple, I saw your sorry ass being pulled into the shadows and thought that if there was a way in, I could definitely open that way back up. It took a hell of a lot out of me, though; you put me through way too much, Wiltburrow," she said whilst waving her fork around. No banana today. I didn't tell her that I heard what she said or how concerned she really sounded. 

"Ok, well, thank you. I owe you my life again. Let's move on. It looks like the Shadowman is bound to the hotel; it's not a spectre, and we can't exorcise what we don't know," I said. 

"It seems like the motel is the issue," Lily said offhandedly. 

"Yeah, well, it's not like we can get rid of the motel," I said. I looked at her and saw excitement in her eyes. It is surprisingly easy to wave around a badge and say that you need to evacuate a motel and then "accidentally" set it on fire; it only took a couple of hours to burn, and with most people evacuated, the fire department didn't learn about it until it was too late. It's fitting in a way: the Shadowman, a creature engulfed in black fire, is laid to rest in a blaze of glory.  

Although I felt a lingering shiver on the site, we decided that after an extra week of surveillance that our job was finished here; officially the case remained open in case of more sightings, but unofficially it was out of our hands.

So do remember, if you find yourself staying at motels and decide to steer away from the light after sundown, do make sure you don't step too far into the shadows.
