Last friday me and my boyfriend did what any self-respecting college-age girlboss would do on a weekend, go out and get drunk! It’s a long week of working and being adults, so you need to go out and have a little fun every now and then. There was no fun to be had that night, as something unimaginable happened, and now I’m stuck reaping the consequences.  
   
We don’t drink that often, so when we do we tend to go all out and really live the moment, just being all we are and partying the night away. I got home at about 5:30, the time I usually do, and my boyfriend was already home. He works a part-time job right now until he gets out of college, so he’s kind of my stay-at-home husband until he gets his career settled. And no, I’m not upset at all, because as I got home he had a date night already planned out. He’s romantic and caring like that, he doesn’t just lay around all day he actually spends it preparing the house and for me to get back.  
   
I came home to a bouquet of flowers, slow music, and candles lighting up the dim home with the scents flowing together as a banquet for my nostrils. It was so cute, I had to take a picture as he prepped up some dinner and served me a nice hot meal as I got comfortable. “Don’t get too comfortable, though, we’ve still got to go out!” he cheerfully announced.  
   
The dinner was nice, and we had a quiet moment with each other, but we were both so excited to go out and hang with our friends. It’s hard to get moments like that nowadays with the busy go go go mentality of the world, so we try to share them any chance we get. We called up our group and made way for the bar just down the street.  
   
We frequent this place about every other weekend, so much so that we know all the regulars and the bartenders. It’s our slice of community away from the woes of work and school. I don’t have to think about how useless an English degree is, nor how awful the paperwork at my office is. As we entered the tiny bar, Jerry the bartender announced our presence.  
   
“Ton’! Lauren! Where ya been? Your seat got cold!” He shouted.  
   
Ray, the middle-aged divorced regular who we see here almost more than Jerry, turned around, “Ay! There’s those kiddos.”  
   
We made our small talks and gathered our bearings as we chose our seats. They were nice guys, but Ray always made me uncomfortable so we sat further down the bar. After we got our drinks, I asked Tony, “Hey, where’s Mikey and Priscilla? Aren’t they supposed to be here by now?” He shrugged and looked at his phone, “No calls or texts, maybe they’re running late?” He stepped out to give them a call.  
   
Jerry moved his way down to other customers, which meant I was there sitting alone by myself in a bar. I knew it was only for a moment, and I knew that I’d been here a thousand times by now, but as a woman you can never shake that feeling. It’s a feeling that no man could ever understand, that vulnerability. You try to relax, but every eye feels sinister and the minds behind them could hold intentions you never even want to think about. But as a woman, you have to think about them.  
   
Maybe it’s just my personal experience with guys, but I just get that icky gross feeling, coupled with the utter shame of sipping on a drink alone in a bar. It was mostly just myself psyching me out, until I saw someone new in that place, sitting with a group of guys we’ve had problems with before. Like I said, we’d been here often enough to know just about everybody in town; I could name everyone in the room, spare him. He was tall, built in that “I go to the gym to make people look at me” kind of way. Snapback cap with a gold chain, utter complete douche just from looking at him. Made sense for him to be sitting with that group of guys.  
   
Well, I shouldn’t have looked. He saw a girl sitting at a bar all by herself, and no man can let that slide. He walked his jock frame right up beside me and sat down, smiling in that fuckboy sort of grin.  
   
“Sup, Derek,” was all his faux deep voice could shit out of his mouth.  
   
“Hi,” was about all I could reply with.  
   
There was an awkward moment of silence. A space in time where neither of us felt comfortable anymore. He broke it by saying, “So, you here with anybody?”  
   
“Yeah, my boyfriend. He’s right outside, but he’s coming right back.”  
   
“Ah, damn. That’s alright, my buddy over there just wanted to ask if you were single. Sorry for the intrusion,” he replied, genuinely politely.  
   
I smiled and nodded, “Thanks, don’t worry about it.”  
   
Then he confidently told me, “Can we at least buy you guys a drink? I know the bartender here, so I can get you guys a discount.”  
   
I was baffled by his ignorance, but kind of humored how this would end up, “Sure, go on ahead!” I replied with a chuckle.  
   
He marched over to the bartender and leaned against the bar, I could see Jerry telling him to stop. I giggled in amusement, watching Jerry grumpily pour a drink. I looked behind me at the door to see Tony still on the phone, getting upset. I frowned, knowing something wasn’t going to plan, but was interrupted by Derek sliding me a drink. “Here you go!”  
   
I looked up at him with my face scrunched, “Thought you guys wanted to get us both drinks?” testing my luck with this guy.  
   
He was taken aback and stuttered, “O-oh! W-well, uh Jim was being kind of an asshat and would only cover o-one.”  
   
I raised an eyebrow and sighed, “Mhm, alright buddy,” I responded.  
   
He hung around for a second while I sipped the drink, lingering for a minute just looking at me. It was probably the most uncomfortable I’d ever been in my life. I tried to just keep my eyes down, not look, not acknowledge, but he was just standing there. Ray, my momentary hero, scooted over.  
   
“Hey, kid! Where’s Tony at?” he asked, glancing menacingly at the man staring over me.  
   
“Um, he’s right outside, I think I should go and see if everything’s ok.”  
   
Derek judged the situation and walked off over to his group of asshats, all high-fiving and cheering. I looked over to Ray and nodded, mouthing, “Thank you.” He simply nodded and grinned, going back to his sickeningly strong drink.  
   
I got up and walked out to Tony to make a note of my exit to douchebag Derek. He had his face in his palm and was rushing someone off the phone. “Fine, hang on, Lauren's coming. Yeah, talk to you soon. Sorry, what’s up, babe?” he asked gently even with his obvious annoyance.  
   
“Was just about to ask you the same, everything ok?” I asked assuringly, stroking his back as I hugged him.  
   
“Yeah, Mike and Priscilla flaked. We can still have some fun here, though, if you’d like.”  
   
“No, babe, it's ok. There’s some douchebags in there who are bothering everybody. Let’s just go home.”  
   
I felt Tony pull away as he looked me in the eye, his face was clearly reading that he was confused but in an angry way. “What? What’re they doing? Are they bothering Jerry? You?” he asked, the subtle anger building in his voice.  
   
“No, baby, it's fine let’s just go home,” I assured him, trying to pull him to the car.  
   
“Did they say something to you? What did they do?” He asked, his voice was booming overtop of me.  
   
“Nothing, they just bought me a drink, can we please just go?” I suggested with urgency.  
   
“No, I’m not gonna let some douchebags ruin our fucking date night! We deserve this! You deserve this! Hell, they’re probably annoying the shit out of Jerry!” he said, his voice getting louder and more angry.  
   
“Please, babe, I don’t want to do this. Let’s just go home,” I begged, resisting as he dragged himself through the doors. I heard muffled shouting, it was going to hell in a handbasket in no time at all. I was scared so I ran inside. “Tony, stop!”  
   
I turned the corner to see Tony on the floor, a group of guys all standing overtop of him, laying their fists and feet down on top of him. “Stop! Let him go! Tony!” I cried.  
   
One of them turned around, Derek. He smiled the most disgusting smile I’d ever seen on a man’s face. “This is your boyfriend? Oh man now I see why you were hitting on me! Come on and sit down, baby, have another drink!”  
   
My face was white as I couldn’t believe what was happening. They didn’t stop laying their fists into him, but I was paralyzed with fear. My body was beneath me and I was looking down at myself, just watching with tears streaming down my face. Ray jumped up from behind the bar, running out and wrapping his arm around me as he shuttled me outside.  
   
“Keep going! Pick up the pace!” he shouted as I heard footsteps crashing behind us.  
   
“B-But Tony!” I screamed out, doing what he said by pure instinct.  
   
“Jerry’s got it covered! Just get in the car!”  
   
I did so and turned on the engine, Ray standing in front of my headlights before crashing down. I saw him receiving the same treatment as Tony, but I couldn’t stop myself from pulling out of park and driving.  
   
Then I heard gunshots. People flooded out of the bar and my heart sank. Derek got off of Ray and I parked again right where I was. My head was clearer now as the adrenaline wore off into horror. I went over to see Ray, battered and bloodied. He lay in a pool of red. I knelt down, “Ray! Ray! Are you ok?” I shouted, he looked up at me and gave me a thumbs up with a cheeky, “Yeah, I ran him off scared.”  
   
I chuckled out of gratitude, but I couldn’t think about how off timing that was as I got up and ran to the door, “Stay there! I have to check on Tony!”  
   
As I rounded the corner, I saw him. He wasn’t moving. Jerry was overtop of him with a pistol. “Ton’! Wake up, man, come on!” he was shouting into Tony’s bloody coat.  
   
I froze again in horror, the tears rolling down and dripping onto the red stained carpet. Tony’s face was swollen up to the point I couldn’t recognize him. He wasn’t breathing. He was just lying there, like he was waiting for true love’s kiss. “Laura, don’t look! Go out and call 911!” Jerry directed me. I was still as a board, my muscles were locked in place.  
   
“Laura! Now!” He demanded.  
   
I snapped out of it and did exactly as he said. The ambulance and police were on the scene in about 5 minutes, rushing Tony to the hospital and receiving statements. As they approached me, my mind went blank. I couldn’t think. My body felt weak. I hit the dirt almost immediately.  
   
When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed. Jerry was beside me, reading a book. He noticed my movement and immediately put it down, rushing up to hug me. “You’re awake. Thank God.”  
   
“W-what? Where am I? Where’s Tony?” I asked, trying to struggle my way up. My body was still numb and sore, so I couldn’t get very far passed pushing Jerry off me.  
   
“So, let’s start with you,” he began to explain, “I didn’t notice somehow, which meant that guy must’ve had a lot of practice with doing this.” His face looked blurry to me, but I could still hear him speak, “But apparently he slipped something in when he gave you that drink.” My mortified expression was evident, as he grabbed my hand and rubbed it trying to comfort me.  
   
“You’re ok though. That shot of adrenaline you got spared you a few minutes and weakened the effects, you’ve only been out for three hours.”  
   
“Three hours? What about Tony? I have to see him, I’ve been asleep for so long!” I said in surprise, unplugging the tubes in my arms.  
   
“No! Lay down, you need to rest. Tony is…” he mumbled out, struggling to find the words to tell me.  
   
“Tony’s what, Ray? Where is he?” I demanded.  
   
“He passed away before he reached the hospital.”  
   
I cried for hours. They let me out of the hospital after about an hour just so they could make sure the drugs weren’t messing with my system. I went home to an empty house, and everything was exactly how we’d left it the night before. It was still, an eerie quiet I don’t wish a single soul to hear. The quaint humming of lights and passerby cars. This desolate solitude mirroring how I felt in my own head, the nothing that accompanied a lost soulmate.  
   
I laid my head down, still groggy from the drugs in my system, when I lost all control and temperament and broke down into tears. Nothing could’ve felt worse than that moment when the dust had settled, except for what came next.  
   
The door ringing. I wasn’t expecting anyone, but it may have been someone coming to give me “prayers” or “be here to talk”, so I ignored it to wallow in my sheets. And it rang again. My thoughts were wild, but being rattled by the piercing sound in the void. I’ll admit that in my grief, I didn’t care who it was, even if I opened that door to my own mother I’d scream her away like a psycho. I just wanted to be left alone. I just wanted to be left alone.  
   
I swung open the door to a masked man with a gun shimmering in his pocket.  
   
“Don’t make me do this now, in public. Let me in,” he muttered in a cold tone.  
   
My eyes went from rage-filled wide to absolute horror. I did as he said, closing the door very slowly. And leaving it unlocked.  
   
He immediately grappled me to the floor, and took off his ski mask. It was Derek. They say a hostage knows they’ll die when their captors take off their masks, I knew a lot worse was going to happen.  
   
“I wanna finish our date, baby,” he said as his weight held me down. I was completely unable to move, fight back, or anything of the sort. I opened my mouth to scream for help, but only a squeak escaped as he slammed his palm right over my face, saying, “Don’t do that, we don’t want anyone to come help now.”  
   
Tears streamed down my face as his gun aimed at my head. I shook my head violently, desperately hoping I would wake up to a warm bed next to Tony. As he smiled sadistically a gunshot rang out across the house. His smile faded into shock, eye twitching.  
   
“Get up! Get him off and go!” I heard a voice yelling.  
   
I managed to push him off quickly, slapping the gun out of his hand and crawling to safety. I watched as he leapt for it in a last ditch effort, only to be put to a chilling halt as more gunshots sounded. His quick jolts as the bullets ripped through him were his final movements, and blood sprayed all over my once peaceful abode.  
   
I stared in shock as a hand pulled me up, “Get her an EMS, stat!” another one yelled. I felt a cold wetness dripping down my stomach, my eyes finally leaving Derek’s limp body to my own, revealing pure red. Was it my own? Was it his?  
   
The paramedics pulled out a small fragment from my torso. Other than the utter trauma, I was fine. They wheeled the body away, and I saw horrified faces glancing at it from inside the police cars. Derek followed me the whole way, he never left. After the cops caught his buddies, finding out they had no idea where he was, it clicked. Most of them will get off scot free, blaming the sociopathic behavior purely on Derek, and their parents all will buy good enough lawyers to wipe away any consequences.  
   
No amount of closure will heal what was taken from me that night. Not that it’s my biggest problem, though, with a bunch of rich douchebags who all probably have a vendetta. I haven’t slept for nights and I’m scared of every bump and person on the street. Please, watch out if you go out for drunk fun, as it could turn into a drunken nightmare in an instant.
