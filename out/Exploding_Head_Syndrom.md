Ever heard of exploding head syndrome? I hadn’t—until it happened. More than once.

The first time was after a nap. An explosion woke me inside my skull. Not thunder, not a car engine—inside, between my ears, like a metal balloon bursting. I walked the house to see what the hell had blown. Everything was normal: my mom watering the plants; warm air.
“Did you hear that?”
“You were dreaming,” she said. I believed her for a while.

Two nights later, again. Sheets of rain, lightning everywhere, but what I heard wasn’t a strike. It was a private bomb with nowhere to echo. In the kitchen I drank water and googled the symptoms: exploding head syndrome. A silly cartoon of a stunned man. “Not serious; just distressing.” Huh. Lights off.

Next morning it happened again. I tried to act normal… until the bathroom. The mirror gave me a different face—swelling, lumps, bruises; a lip like a tennis ball. No pain. Not even when I pressed it.
“Maybe I fell,” I told my mom. “Sleepwalking.”
“Where?” she said. “I don’t see anything.”

That’s when the different fear showed up: the fear I was going insane.

Back to the mirror. The marks were still there. I punched my cheek with a closed fist—felt the punch, not the wound. The doorbell rang. The neighbor wanted oil. “Do I look off?” I asked. “You look fine,” he said. I took a selfie. Perfect. Photos lied. Mirrors didn’t.

The fourth blast hit at lunch, with my mouth full. I jumped from the chair, spat food, ran to my room. Worse: a fresh gash with dried blood along the edges; my right temple swollen, pushing the ear; the eye half buried. My mom stood behind me, hand on my shoulder. She didn’t speak. We booked an appointment. Psychiatry in two weeks.

That night another one came. And another. Between them, the same kit: pressure on the eardrums like a plane dropping; fluorescent hum; a metallic taste that water wouldn’t wash away. I stopped looking at mirrors. Showered without looking, dried without looking, brushed my teeth in the kitchen. I learned the house’s tricks: the oven door reflects if the overhead is on; the microwave rim, too; the TV’s black bezel when it’s off—worse. Outside, any shop window could hand me a second of that warped face that wasn’t mine anymore. We live surrounded by reflections. I get all of them.

They admitted me for two days. More than a hundred blasts: near, far, right beside me. Nurses checked vitals; doctors muttered; someone said stress, someone parasomnia. I listened to the hum like tape that never cuts. Some blasts stopped sounding and started biting. Others sounded like screams. I don’t know if they were mine.

Little by little, each blast brought something new. Once, my left ear went deaf for half an hour. Another time, my right eye doubled—but only inside the mirror. Out here everything was fine. In glass, half my face took one lane and the other half another, like the reflection had its own traffic. I tried a week without mirrors. When I came back, the mirror punished me: my forehead split, a cross-shaped cut, bone peeking like a bad tooth. I laughed by reflex. No idea why.

My mom asked me not to lock myself in. Said that made it worse. I said worse was looking. We covered the mirrors with towels. They looked like framed funerals. The house still had eyes. A spoon was enough.

One blast found me in the bank line. Nobody turned. Metal flooded my mouth. I caught myself in the glass door: my lip hung like a bag. I blinked and it snapped back. I wanted to tell someone, but they called the next number and I stayed quiet. The ticket said 73. I let 74 go past me.

I googled again, out of habit. Forums. People who see everything, people who see nothing, people who joke. I closed it all. The hum stayed.

I don’t know when I decided to end this. The idea stuck—clean, neat. The gun on the nightstand. The last decision in the bathroom.

I went to the mirror to aim. I did what anyone would do: looked for an eye, a temple. There wasn’t a face above my neck. There was something buckled and wet—a black rose with petals of flesh, veins knotted, bone splinters like thorns. I brought the barrel close to the glass and tried to find a center. The reflection didn’t give me one.

I set the gun on the sink and listened. Another blast came, small, like a snap. Then the hum. The metal returned to my tongue.
I can’t keep living like this.

I want to sleep.
