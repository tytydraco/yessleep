My name is Norman. This is a story about how me and my sister were almost hunted down by a dead woman. Every holiday, my grandmother would visit us in New York to celebrate with us. I knew that she lived somewhere near the countryside, but I hadn’t been there before. My parents explained that it was because the town my grandmother had lived in was very small and run-down and that my grandmother didn’t want to bring me there because it was unsafe. I never believed that. How could grandma live in a run-down small town if she brought expensive gifts for us whenever she came? I was skeptical about the whole “unsafe” thing too, but it wasn’t off the table.

Last Christmas, before she left, I asked grandma if she would bring me there someday. She laughed, patted my head, and left. Without answering my question. It upset me a little bit. My father would always get teary eyed before she left. We had to pray the Rosary right after she left. It was the must-do rule. I figured it was so that she would have a safe trip home. I would still do it, but I found it odd how father would always get emotional or teary eyed while doing it. I figured he was just worried since grandma’s house was a long drive away, and she was an 82 year old woman who had to drive that whole distance. 

I once asked dad why he wouldn’t drive her there himself. Mother got emotional, and hugged my father. I stared for a while, still left without an answer. He gave a choked response. “I’m not very… accepted there,” he tried answering. It made me think that maybe he had been banished for doing something wrong. Maybe he escaped from jail there? No, he would never do anything wrong.

Grandmother came back 5 days later in time for New Year’s eve. I was curious, so I asked her why she didn’t just stay the entire week to save gas and stuff. Again, she laughed, patted my head, and walked away, leaving me annoyed without an answer. Of course, the next day, right after breakfast, grandma was getting ready to leave again. Mother woke me up right before she left. I scurried downstairs with mother to have a last goodbye, but she immediately blocked me when she saw grandmother on the front porch talking to father.

“It’s too late,” mother said, “she’s leaving.” “She’s right there still. Why can’t I just hug her and say goodbye quickly?” I pleaded. “No.” mother said, bluntly. The bathroom in our house has a small window that leads out to a small pathway to our backyard. A light bulb sparked in my brain. The discussion with father and grandma seemed serious, like they’d be there for a while. I ran up to my sister and almost shouted, before I realized mother was still in the master bedroom right beside ours. I leaned to her ear and whispered, “We’re going to grandma’s house.”

She looked at me like I was stupid. “We’re not allowed to, remember?” she said, annoyed that I had woken her up to say that. “I have an idea. Grab an extra outfit and stuff it in my backpack, here. She disregarded it, and covered herself in a blanket. “Fine,” I said, annoyed, as I stuffed her outfit into my bag myself, and packed an outfit of my own. “Please? I want to see what it’s like out there.” I told her. “Fine!” she shouted. I stood there in silence for a moment, hoping mother hadn’t heard it. “Shhh. Mom is in the other room. I already packed you an outfit. Let’s go. We creeped downstairs to the bathroom, in our pajamas.

I passed grandma, and waved. Father noticed, and asked “What are you doing?” “I’m going to the bathroom, and Emma is going to play XBox.” I replied. Of course, it was a lie. We got to the bathroom without them noticing. I looked up at the window, “You think I can fit in there?” I asked. “Probably.” she answered. I climbed up to the window, and surprisingly, made it through. Emma was 3 years younger than me, so of course she would fit as well. “Throw the bag here before you climb out.” She tossed the bag and climbed out. Thankfully, I was only 10 and she was 7, so we made it out with ease. “Let’s go.” I whispered. Grandma’s car was parked near the side of the house, away from the porch where they were having a conversation. The door to the trunk was unlocked. We entered, hiding ourselves between 2 suitcases dad had placed horizontally. We put the backpack on top of us, hiding us completely.

At this point, dad and grandma had finished their conversation, and were on their way to the car. There was a tiny hole in our little hiding spot that gave us a view of the small triangular window in the trunk of the car. Grandma got in, and dad waved goodbye. We made it. We were coming home with grandma. 10 minutes later, grandma received a call from father. He must have noticed we were gone when he went to call us for that Rosary prayer and we didn’t show. Grandma called out for us, “Kids?! Are you in here?!” She worriedly shouted. I looked at my sister, then back to the front of the car. “Here…” I said, ashamed.

She looked surprised for a second, then told my dad over the phone. “They’re over here, son.” She looked back at us, “What are you doing here, kiddos? You know you can’t come home with me.” she said, with a glint of sadness in her eyes. Enough for me and Emma to notice. We heard father shout over the phone, “Kids! Get back here!”, as mother cried in the background. “Why does it have to be so serious? It’s just a fun sleepover with gran!” I said, trying to lighten up the mood. I looked back at grandma. She was silent. She looked at the road, then back to us. Grandma told dad over the phone, “I’m taking them home, George.” My father screamed in reply, heard from the phone that wasn’t even on speaker anymore, “Mom! It’s 4:40! You’ve already left late!” It confused me a little. “I’m not putting them in that danger.” Grandma said, sternly. Father was left silent. “What danger?” Emma asked, finally popping out from the hiding spot. “Please. We want to come with you.” I pleaded with grandma. She looked back at me with tears in her eyes. It was 4:45 PM by now. Father finally broke the silence, speaking softly, “You have to take them, ma.” I could tell he was crying. Mother was crying loudly in the background, as well.

Grandma began tearing up as well. “You’re coming with me, okay kids? Don’t leave my side when we get there.” she said, not looking at us. I looked at Emma, seriously concerned at this point. After that conversation, both of us were unsure if we even wanted to go still. I hugged her tightly, ensuring that we would be ok. I wasn’t sure of it, though. Grandma began driving again. It was finally happening. We were going to come home with grandma. At this point, Emma and I had hopped out of the trunk and sat in the backseats. We gripped each other’s hands tightly the entire time. An hour later, we could tell that we were getting closer. I could see the mountains in the distance. Emma was asleep beside me, her hand still clutched onto mine. I tried taking a short nap, as well. I tried, but I couldn’t fall asleep. Maybe it was because of the tiny car seat I was sitting on. Maybe it was because I was scared of what we would find in grandma’s town. No big deal, I thought. 30 minutes later, we arrived. It was around 6:20 PM by this point. She reached the entry gate, and showed her ID to the guard. He let her in, after glancing at me and my sister, then looked back at my grandma, with a judgemental glare. We arrived at her house, and I woke up Emma. She hesitated for a while, but I assured her we would be fine with grandma.

Grandma walked up to the door, as we followed her, until she looked back for a while. She prayed shortly in her mind, then looked at us. “Right. Sorry,” she said, as she hurried us into the house. “Hurry kids! Come on, get in.” she said as she quickly shut the door. She locked the blinds shut, and locked the 4 locks on the door. Deadbolted. It’s as if she was preparing for some sort of apocalypse. She showed us to our room. It had a bunk bed. I called dibs on the top bunk, so Emma would be sleeping on the bottom bunk. Grandma put a cross on top of the dresser, before leaving us to go to the kitchen.

“So… this is fun…” I said, trying to distract myself from the situation. “I’m starting to regret this,” Emma replied. “Relax… we’ll be fi-i-ine” I said. Emma had brought her Nintendo with her, so she used it to keep her occupied. I had nothing to distract me. I crawled down the ladder to stay beside Emma, to provide both her and I comfort. I watched her play Mario Kart, despite her shaking hands stopping her from ranking anything above 8th Place. Grandma called us out for dinner, so we gathered at the dining table. We sat down, before she stared at us for a while. “Hey kids! So… I have some rules for you guys while you’re here,” she said. “Oh. Sure!” I said, still trying to hold on to the last bit of excitement I had for this sleepover.

“Ok,” she said, in a more serious tone, “Firstly, you cannot leave the house after 7:00 PM, got it?” She said, as she glanced at the clock. It was exactly 6:50 PM. She looked at the door next. It was locked. I could sense her getting less tense. “Alright, now, don’t look out of your windows when you go back to your room, ok? I shut the blinds for you, don’t worry,” she assured us. “This is the most important rule. If you hear anything, and I mean anything, from outside your window. You are to remain silent at all costs. Don’t. Make. A noise,” she said, so sternly it froze me and Emma for a while. “We understand,” Emma replied before I could. We ate dinner together, slowly. We were chatting casually for a while, and I almost forgot about everything. I wasn’t nervous until about 10 minutes into dinner, when gran looked back at the clock. “Oh. It’s 7:00 PM,” she said, softly, almost nervously. “Finish quickly, alright kids?” she told us. We hurriedly finished dinner.

After dinner, we hugged grandma goodnight, and went back to our rooms. I had left a sketchpad in my bag from a road trip mother and I had gone on a few days back, and Emma and I played tic tac toe and other games to pass the time. It worked, for a while. At around 8:45 PM, Emma heard some sort of wailing from the forest in the back of the house. She went up to the window, before I stopped her. “Grandmother told us not to look out the window,” I told her. She froze in shock. “Oh! I almost forgot that!” She shouted. She covered her mouth. “Oops… we also weren’t supposed to make any sound…” I slapped my forehead. “Just get away from the window!” I quietly outcried. She backed up from the window. She sat beside me, shivering in fear, as the wailing got quieter. After calming down a little, she whispered in my ear. “I didn’t see anything, don’t worry. But… I looked to the side of the window… it’s still unlocked. It’s cracked open a bit.”

I immediately turned my head to the side, looking at the window. It was slightly cracked open. I creeped up to the window. I reached my hand out, covering my eyes as my head was faced backwards. I tried to feel for the handle, but I was so nervous, I accidentally grabbed the bar of the window grill, thinking it was the handle. When I felt it, I grabbed it, and twisted it to the side to lock the door. I lowered the blinds again. I opened my eyes, when I saw Emma with her hand over her mouth, about to cry. I ran to her, making as little sound as possible. “What’s wrong?” I asked. “When you were reaching for the handle… I saw… there was a woman behind you.”

I stood there, frozen still. “You… you grabbed her finger!” Emma cried. The thing I initially grabbed onto that I thought was a bar on the window grill was a woman’s finger. “What… what did the woman look like?” I asked, trying to keep my composure. “She was wearing a black… well… a black long sleeve shirt, with flared cuffs, but there were rips all over it, the right sleeve was ripped completely off until right above her elbow. Her hair looked like a messily cut bob. I thought maybe there was a small chance that she was grandma’s neighbor, until she put a hand up to the window. She had claws for hands.” It was at this point that Emma started crying. I tried to shush her, until I remembered the rules. “Emma… you looked her in the eye, didn’t you?” I asked, unable to accept this information, as she sat there crying silently. I felt that was my answer. “Yes… yes I did…” she confirmed it. I shut my eyes for a second, hoping it was all a dream. “Let’s go to grandma,” I said, running to grandma’s room and banging on the door.

She gave a quiet startled response. She must have been asleep. I continued banging on the door until she answered. “What?! What’s wrong?!” grandma asked. “Emma… our window was unlocked, so I locked it, but I closed my eyes while locking it, but Emma saw a

Woman near the window, and she looked her in the eye by accident. What do we do?!” I explained, speaking so fastly even grandma couldn’t wrap her mind around the situation. She got a few words out, though. “Well… where… Emma… where is she?” she asked. I looked her in the eye, then looked behind me. She wasn’t there.

I rushed back to the room. “Emma?!” I shouted. My eyes rushed to the bottom bunk where she was sitting. She wasn’t there. Thankfully, I heard her speak softly from the top bunk. “Norman?” I rushed up the ladder, to find her covering herself with a blanket. I pulled the blanket off and went to comfort her instinctively. My poor self only realized that the person under the blanket was the woman by the window when I was right beside her. I looked her in the eye.

I screamed, but she didn’t get to grab me as grandma took my leg and pulled me out. As I was pulled out from the top bunk, I fell off the ladder, but landed on my butt, in a way that didn’t hurt enough for me to sit there in pain for even a second. I rushed out of the room, calling Emma’s name as I ran around the house. I looked behind me, and the woman never came out of the room. Grandma, who didn’t get to see the woman, and only pulled me out because she heard my scream, asked me what the woman looked like. I explained, and she stood there quietly for a while, before looking back at the hallway leading to the room as she whispered under her breath, “Margaret…” She told me to hide in the shed near the backyard.

I began running there, but on my way, I spotted Emma behind a counter in the kitchen. I ran to her, and she began to cry in my arms. “She appeared again. She crawled through the window!” I told her, “That’s impossible. We locked it.” “I said she crawled through the window!” she screamed. She screamed loud enough for “Margaret” to hear. I was about to grab Emma’s hand and run to the shed like I promised grandma, when we heard her claws scrape against the floor, getting closer and closer to the kitchen, where we were. We hid in an empty cabinet under the sink. The claw sounds continued getting closer and closer, until it appeared to be right in front of us. We heard a loud bang, and our grandmother’s voice. We heard the wailing noise again. We realized that the wailing noise belonged to Margaret. Her real voice.

I peeked out, and saw that grandma had hit Margaret on the head with a pan. I took Emma’s hand, and took her to the shed in the backyard, as grandma led us out. I locked the door to the shed, as Emma and I were left to listen to the sound of metal clashing, breaking tiles, and shattering glass. It went on for about 30 minutes. After that, came straight silence. We waited around 5 more minutes, before stepping out of the shed. I grabbed a wrench from the top shelf of the shed before leaving, as Emma followed me quietly, holding a tiny spade.

We cautiously stepped into the kitchen. The last place we had seen them. It had to have been around 10:00 PM at this time. Neither my grandmother nor Margaret were there anymore. They weren’t in the house at all. All that was left was a crooked knife, a pan detached from its handle, and a broken cabinet door. Right, there was also a trail of blood leading out to the woods. We could only assume the worst. Emma and I ran out of the house and knocked on the neighbor’s door. It didn’t matter who it was. I needed to keep Emma and I safe. They wouldn’t answer their door. It seems as though they had taken the same safety measures grandma did. I remembered I had brought my cell phone with me, but it was back in the bedroom, inside my backpack.

I told Emma to wait outside in front of the neighbor’s porch, as I  quietly walked back into the bedroom, and grabbed my cell phone. I decided to grab the entire backpack as well. I came back, and thankfully, Emma was still there. I dialed mother’s number, but she didn’t answer the first time. It was already late at night, around 10:20 PM, so she was probably asleep already. I dialed again, and she answered, and spoke in a soft voice. It was obvious she had just woken up. “Norman? Hello? Is something wrong?” I heard my dad gasp in the background. “Yes! Grandma is missing!” I proceeded to explain everything to my mother. It was silent for a while. Then, dad grabbed the phone. “Listen to me, Norman.”

“Is Emma with you?” he asked. I said yes. “Look for the house with the bright red roof, it’s tall, you shouldn’t miss it.” I looked around, and spotted it immediately. I ran over there, as advised by father. “There are no locks on the door. Just knock and you’ll see Mr. Nelson. He’s bald and looks to be around 65 years old.” I knocked on the door, and sure enough. Mr. Nelson answered. I explained that I was the son of Theodore Smith, as dad told me to say. He stood there, thinking for a moment, as if trying to remember, then accepted us into the house. At this point, father had ended the call, already on his way to pick us up. “It’s going to get better from here,” I thought to myself.

Mr. Nelson’s house was… unique, to say the least. There were guns everywhere, and almost no windows. Just as Emma and I were getting suspicious, he led us to his study, where we spotted a police badge. We both let out a sigh of relief. He asked us for the full story, so we told it to him. He made a face just like the one grandma made the first time I told her the story. “Ah… Margaret,” he said. It sent a shiver down my spine. He called 7 police officers and 3 investigators over to grandma’s house, as he and one other investigator watched over me and my sister and got our statements. 2 more police guards guarded the front door. For the first time the whole night, Emma and I felt safe.

We waited for what felt like the whole night. In reality, it was only an hour. An hour before they rushed grandmother to Mr. Nelson’s house. She had bruises on her legs and cuts on her face. Thankfully, she was still walking and conscious. We still heard police officers outside, as we dreaded who they would bring in next. We waited, and stared, but the police officers walked in alone. We rushed to grandma and gave her a hug. She whispered weakly, as if still in slight pain “I told you guys I’d protect you. Pretty strong for a woman at 82, huh?” She laughed. We tried to force a chuckle, still shocked from the whole situation.

She had told us Margaret dragged her into the woods, and tied her to a tree as she tried to find us in the shed in the backyard. Grandma remained tied to the tree until the police officers found her. If I had continued hiding in the shed with Emma, I dread to think what would’ve happened. Thankfully we got out of there.

Around 40 minutes later, father and mother arrived to take us home. At last, this whole thing was coming to a close. Mother rushed into the house and hugged us both, along with grandma. We were all in a tight embrace for about 3 minutes, without saying a word. After that, mother began crying as the police officers told her what happened. Mom told us to wait outside in the car with dad. As soon as we got into the car, father began scolding us. He didn’t get too mad, though. He bit his tongue and said he was just glad we were safe. About 30 minutes later, mother came back out and we drove home together. As we left the village, I looked to my right, and noticed that Emma was still clinging onto my hand. She was fast asleep, just like on the car ride here. Grannie’s car shortly followed ours, as the police were still investigating her house, so she would spend the night at our house again.

After what felt like forever, we finally arrived back home. I had never been so glad to be back. We got changed, and were quickly put to sleep by mother.

Finally, this nightmare was over. I looked over at Emma before falling asleep. To my surprise, she was already knocked out in bed. “I’m proud of you for being so brave, sis.” I whispered, even though she wouldn’t even hear me. The next morning, I woke up for breakfast at 8:00 AM with grandma again. It was like nothing ever happened.

I know better than to just forget it did happen, though. Everything about that night was terrifying, but I’m proud of myself for overcoming it. For being brave. For protecting Emma.

2 weeks later, grandma was about to leave our house. She waved goodbye, patted my head, and laughed, before heading back to the car. There was a new meaning to it this time, though. A good one.

Over time, the nightmares began to cease. For both me and Emma. One thing we do know is that we will never be going to visit grandma ever again.

Almost 12 months later, I had been decorating the house in time for Christmas, as grandma would be spending the night with us again. Emma and I were so excited to see her again. We wanted her to see how much we had matured and grown over the last year. As we heard her car pull up, we were all waiting in the living room for her. Dad jumped up and answered the door immediately. Emma and I were sitting on the couch, eager to see her again. Father opened the door, and we finally saw grandmother. Something was different about her. I suppose she had grown and changed over time as well. Her whole demeanor had changed. It could have been natural. It was at that moment that we made a shocking realization. We were left on the couch, frozen in shock once again. As mother fawned over her new sleek style.

Everything from her shiny bright red heels, fresh cut bob hairstyle, and sleek black long-sleeved blouse with those flared cuffs. 

You know the rest of the story.
