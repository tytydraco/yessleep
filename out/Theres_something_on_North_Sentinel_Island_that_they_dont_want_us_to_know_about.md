 

Explorer's Log: It has been two weeks since our expedition to North Sentinal Island was greenlit by the authorities. We've been due to report back on our findings, but I'm not sure if I can bring myself to admit what we have seen out here. It is probably best that the island remain off limits, for the safety of all involved. Our team was made up of a dozen scientists, anthropologists, and explorers. From the beginning, it had been assumed that the island was uninhabited, so our primary mission was to explore the island and catalog its flora and fauna. 

We anchored off the coast in a research vessel and used small outboard boats to make our way to shore. As soon as we set foot on land, we knew something was wrong. There was an unnatural stillness in the air, like the island had been sealed off from the rest of the world. We trudged through the thick jungle, hacking away at the dense underbrush with our machetes. The heat was oppressive, and the humidity made it difficult to breathe. As we ventured deeper into the jungle, we began to see signs of life. Small animals scurried away from us, and the occasional bird or monkey could be heard in the distance. But it was the silence that was most unnerving. No birds sang, no insects buzzed, and the only sound was the occasional rustling of the leaves in the wind.

After a few hours, we reached the edge of a clearing. In the center of the clearing was a large stone structure, roughly the size of a small house. The structure was made of a dark stone, and it was clear that it had been there for a long time. We cautiously approached the structure, expecting to find some sort of ancient temple. But what we found were the remains of a small village. The huts were made of crudely cut logs and mud, and there were several large stone statues lining the perimeter. As we stepped closer, we noticed something even more unsettling: the statues were in the shape of human figures, but their heads had been replaced with animal skulls.

Our team quickly retreated to the edge of the clearing, feeling an inhuman presence lurking in the shadows. We stood there for a few minutes, trying to comprehend what we had seen. It was then that we heard a deep, guttural voice from within the shadows. "Leave. Now." The voice reverberated through the clearing, sending a chill down our spines. We quickly made our way back to the boats, and as we pulled away from the shore, I could feel the presence of something ancient and evil watching us.

Back on the research vessel, we recounted what we had seen and tried to make sense of the strange village and its inhabitants. We agreed that the island should remain off limits, for the safety of all involved. We also agreed to keep our findings a secret, never to speak of it again. It's now been two weeks since our expedition to North Sentinal Island, and I still can't shake the feeling that something dark and sinister lurks in those shadows. I can only hope that the island remains off limits, for the safety of all involved.
