I don't believe in ghosts, gods, or aliens.  
I'm just an ordinary person living in this city.

But there's something I've never dared to tell anyone.

Sometimes, I have these strange dreams.  
In them, I'm not myself.  
I'm someone else.

Not just observing, but living.  
I can feel their breath, their heartbeat, even their pain.  
It's like... my entire being is forcefully shoved into another soul.

Each time, the dream ends at the most suffocating moment.  
Like a phone line being abruptly cut, I always wake up drenched in sweat.

Are these people real?  
Or is there something wrong with my mind?

I don't know.

But I do know that every time I wake up, there's this lingering pain in my chest.  
A feeling of losing something I can't retrieve.

Tonight is no different.

My eyelids grow heavier, and despite my efforts, I can't stay awake.

Before darkness completely engulfs me, one last thought flashes through my mind:

—Who will I become this time?

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
I was a police officer.  
That night, I was investigating a missing homeless person.  
They had left behind an old Nokia phone.  
Inside, there was only a short video.

The recording began.

The homeless man was panting, muttering to himself:  
"What's going on here... kids out this late..."

Then he cautiously asked, "Kid? Are you okay?"

The video shook—  
followed by a sharp, piercing scream, almost inhuman.

I replayed it several times.  
Each time, a chill ran down my spine.

Finally, a lead.  
But something about that scream felt… wrong.  
It wasn't human.  
It felt like something pretending to be human.

I didn't realize this was a one-way pursuit.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That night, I decided to patrol the area where the homeless person had disappeared.

At 2 AM, near a downtown alley, I saw them.

Two children, thinly dressed, pale, silently walking along the deserted street.

I stepped out of the car.  
"Kids? Are you okay?"

No response.  
They just continued forward.

I hesitated.

Should I wait for backup?  
Or act alone?

A strange, ancient voice whispered faintly in my mind:  
"If you miss this chance, you'll never find them again."

My heart clenched.  
I chased after them.

Their movements were unnaturally smooth—gliding rather than walking.

I quickened my pace, following them into a dead-end alley.

The taller child slowly turned his head.

Under the dim light, I saw—

His eye sockets were disturbingly hollow,  
skin clinging tightly to bones,  
as if his soul had been extracted, leaving only a shriveled shell.

My breath caught.

Instinctively, I reached for my radio.  
Static filled my earpiece.  
No signal.  
No backup.

Just as I braced myself to retreat,  
a faint chuckle echoed behind me.

I spun around—

A young man stood there, waving at me urgently,  
"This way! Hurry!"

I recognized him.  
The youth who had vanished days ago.

A kidnapping ring? I thought quickly.

He lowered his head, murmuring,  
"Almost there..."

His voice had two layers—  
one youthful,  
the other like ancient whispers seeping from below.

Suddenly, the alley walls began to crack open.

One after another, narrow fissures appeared,  
and from them emerged childlike figures.

Beyond the cracks, there were no streets, no buildings—  
just a grayish-white, frozen wasteland.

In that silent desolation, they moved quietly,  
shadows breeding in a nightmare.

I recognized some faces—  
the girl who vanished in April,  
the children from the June summer camp,  
the youth from last year.

Their faces were pale, eyes hollow, mouths twisted in eerie smiles.

They approached me unhurriedly, step by step.

I reached for my gun—but before my fingers touched the holster,  
they had already pounced.  
Cold, stiff fingers gripped my wrists, shoulders, neck.

Even their small hands held unnatural strength,  
dragging me relentlessly toward the fissure.

Inside the crack, a blinding white light.

I had nowhere to escape.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I awoke in a white haze.  
Ceiling, the hiss of a ventilator.  
My wrists and ankles bound by soft yet firm straps.

An older doctor stood beside me.  
Metal-framed glasses, pristine white coat, a gentle smile.

That smile sent chills down my spine.

Instinctively, I reached for my gun—but my waist was empty.

The doctor leaned in close and whispered calmly:  
"No need to worry.  
You're our second mature brain sample.  
Much better than the last one."

He gestured casually toward the adjacent bed.

I turned my head.

A twisted, grayish mass lay there, faintly pulsing.  
Once alive. Once human.

The doctor gently placed a mirror before me.

I stiffly lowered my head.

My reflection… wasn't me.

I opened my mouth to scream,  
but the sound died in my throat.

He whispered softly:  
"Your memories will fade soon.  
You’ll be one of us."

He smiled, adding quietly:  
"Dream function terminated successfully.  
Soon, you won't dream at all.  
Without dreams… there's no resistance. No chaos.  
We've been waiting for this day."

The last thing I saw—  
was the light in my own eyes, slowly fading into darkness.

And then—

nothing.
