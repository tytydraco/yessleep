I have not been well these past few months.



My wife and I had as amicable a divorce as you could imagine. Unfortunately, I’m the type who puts his thoughts on a wheel and lets them spin until they come back to center again. It must have been thousands of times that I thought about how different my life would be if I could have just swallowed the words and forgotten. But I didn’t swallow the words, and my life isn’t different.



At night I could lie still for a while, but then I’d jolt awake, flinching at the thought of the empty room in my house. A clawing hand would grip my stomach and pull up. “Where is it?”. It always ran through my head. The room was empty and something was supposed to be in them. I needed to get out. So when my office offered the opportunity to get out of town I took it without a second thought.



I’m a financial bookkeeper. For the most part it’s a fairly simple job, tedious and frustrating, but simple. However, a young man had requested some assistance in managing his deceased grandfather’s estate. Mr. Geltman worked fully with paper and organized it all in such a way that only a man who had built up the system over the course of decades could figure it out.



The house was old but well maintained. Mr. Geltman had clearly loved it. And people that love something take care of them. They should anyway.



Geltman was a collector of novelty clocks, garden gnomes, baseball bats, and of course, documents. Every room left just enough space for a slightly overweight old man to squeeze through.

Originally I was supposed to meet Vince, the inheritor, at the property to get shown around but he decided rather quickly that he had a deadman’s wallet to start emptying and had instead flown to Las Vegas. I doubt he would have been able to help me anyways. It took four days just to organize everything in a way that was somewhat trackable. Geltman kept incredibly detailed papers; the actual act of balancing it all was rather quick. My job wasn’t really to balance the books anyways. Geltman had turned in proper taxes all his life, nothing needed to be solved. My real job was to make decades of careful bookkeeping digestible to a clueless twenty-something. That and convince Vince to keep us on as a permanent part of his future endeavors.



Death, it all started smelling like death, a burning pungent death. I had taken over a wooden desk in a small reading room. In a matter of moments I went from typing in numbers on a laptop to gripping my mouth and kneeling over to stop myself from covering the floor in bile.



I stuffed my nostrils with tissue paper till the skin of my nose was stretched into a half circle. The smell was strong enough to get through to my head, but it was subdued enough to not reach my stomach.



Pushing a cabinet out of the way I saw a small hole and a fine yellow powder pressed into the wall. The hold was gnawed, small rough bites being taken out of the wood. Looking around, I found a broom and a pan, swept it up and headed towards the trash can that was waiting near the side of the road outside. I don’t know what the powder is but I had no doubt that the smell comes from it. My arms were fully extended to keep the pan as far from me as possible. When I turned the lid of the bin up a scurry of feet hit the side of the plastic and poured out the side, the wave of rats disappearing into the grass.



I covered the street in a soft beige.



Inside the trash bin was a pile of yellow powder. It was so overwhelming. I felt like a child again, staring into a toilet bowl begging my mom to make the pain stop as another build up of bile climbed up my throat.

I turned the nozzle on the hose and rinsed my mouth out before taking off my shirt and spraying down my front. Water was good. It was really good. A few nails and a bit of leftover wood in the shed out back later I blocked the hole inside and went to bed.



The hole was twice as big when I woke up. I moved my set up to a different room. 



It took about half a day but I went into town and talked to a man at a hardware store that looked like he knew how to kill rats and came back with a number of buckets, cans, peanut butter, and a metal lock box to keep my food in.



As the man explained in extreme detail, if you cover a soda can in peanut butter and place it precariously on a bit of wire over a bucket filled with water, rats will climb on the wire to get to the peanut butter, the can will spin, and the rats hit the water where they drown.



I set up five of these buckets and let me tell you, they work. When I checked the next day the first bucket had three separate rats loosely floating at the top of the water. The smell hit me, but it wasn't nearly as strong as before. I was very happy that I had also purchased some gloves. Each bucket was lifted up and taken to the nearby pond where I dumped them out. When I had emptied the final one I noted that the ones from the first had started to dry out in the sun. A faint yellow haze lifted from them, visible in the sunlight like dust in a windowbeam



Even happier I got the gloves. I grabbed one of the rats that had begun to dry and I gently shook it. A swarm of yellow powder was left behind in movement, like a kid with dandruff running their fingers through their hair.



More holes had appeared in the house and I had begun to feel more than a little disturbed. I was planning to get a motel when I realized that I didn’t smell death. In that stupid way humans act when a scent was gone I instinctually leaned closer to the rat to ensure that the smell was gone. It smelled like the sheets of my bed.



Not the bed I’d left behind, but the one I had before. It smelled like an argument over what to eat for dinner. It smelled like the pages of a copy of What to Expect in the First Year  and a trip to IKEA. It smelled like a filled room.



I was in that headspace for a bit until I heard the sound of a titter behind me. Staring at me from the grass was a opossum. Its white face pulled back in fits of effort. Once it knew I was aware of its presence, it walked slowly into the woods. A cloud of yellow powder rising up with every movement of its coat.



I followed it. Deeper into the woods we went. It was like I had just woken up from a bad dream. The opossum stopped in front of a bone white cliff side with a number of gaps, each specific and unnatural like they were carved out by a machine.



The opossum pressed its back against the wall and rubbed back and forth until the yellow powder had formed a small layer on top of the rock. Its five clawed hands reached out unnaturally and began to draw. It etched out a small visage of its kin. The powder began to seep into the rock. And the rock began to seep out of itself. A small bundle of flesh pushing its way out of pure stone. It pushed and pushed and pushed until the sack fell out on the leafy ground. The opossum picked it up and placed it on its back. The newborn clung to its mother.  
  


I watched it all calmly. And when it was over the opossum pressed its side to the wall once more, leaving another layer of yellow powder. It’s beady eyes staring at me. Its mouth was pulling at the seams in spurts of uncontrollable noise. Small laughter escaping into my ear despite the efforts it put forward. Then it left.



I went back to sleep.



Death once again filtered into my nostrils. The smooth aroma returned to its pungent roots. I covered my mouth and found myself unwilling to move. It was there, and I used it to draw.



I gave my daughter her mother’s eyes.

I gave my daughter the full eyebrows that were on my face.

I gave her hair, ears, arms, legs, blood, guts, and a smile.

And nothing happened.  
  


My eyes stayed still on the visage but it remained simply a cliffside.When I returned to the old house I was tired and went to bed.



“Daddy!”



My body stretched up with my mind catching up as I sprinted to the door.



“Daddy!”



My hands slammed into the lightswitch and the hallway turned bright. The door across from mine was closed.



“I’m scared…”



The door wouldn’t open. I could hear her on the other side. Her voice was shaking and desperate. Mine was probably the same.



I slammed my body into the door. The solid wood didn’t give.



“Please! Where are you?”



Running into another room I took one of Geltman’s bats, and I swung. Over and over until the door fell down.



It was an empty room.



It will always be an empty room.



As I stared into the nothing, a small sound of laughter began to ring out. Standing out on the window sill was the opossum. It’s once restrained joy fully burst forth in wave after wave of laughter.



When I woke up the next day the door was destroyed. Just as I left it. But the rats were gone, and the stoneface was without a single blemish.



Vince didn’t care about the door. He was too drunk to care about anything. And frankly I didn’t care about it either. It’s not like the door was guarding anything anyway. I absently went through the numbers before I finally went home.



It was probably too late at that point but I got a therapist. It’s nice to talk about everything. But I don’t want to tell them about this. I just want to put it out there so it's not solely on my shoulders and try not think about it anymore.



I’m hopeful that maybe someday I’ll be able to swallow it down and use that room for something.
