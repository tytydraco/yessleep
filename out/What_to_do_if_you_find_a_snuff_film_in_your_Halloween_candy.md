“Why are you so pale?” David said with a punchable smirk. 

The joke didn't even work anymore, as I was now in full costume and the apparently permanent face paint seemed at home. It began three days ago, when I wore the same Beetlejuice costume to an early Halloween party. I picked it up at Largo's, a small store nestled in the center of town that sold costumes and masks throughout October, and party gimmicks for the rest of the year. The old European guy who ran the place, who I assumed was called Largo, had a reputation for selling some pretty high quality stuff. I felt like I had an unlucky soul for buying one of the duds. I painted my face white, with exaggerated black bags around the eyes, just as the picture on the front of the package suggested. Although my constant washing and scrubbing of my face had dulled it, it was still firmly there, and my friends didn't let me forget it. I counted down the minutes until the 31st, when I could finally go outside again and blend in. 

I wasn't the worst dressed in our posse of twelve year olds. Most of the costumes were homemade, and held together by a mix of safety pins and wishful thinking. A group of five set out on our last annual sugar hunt. There was an air of finality and we knew it, but didn't let that get in the way of our tradition. We weren't the best of friends, and some barely spoke at school, but every Halloween the five of us, who all lived on the same cul-de-sac, would assemble for trick or treating. That figure of five did not include Shane, Michael's little brother who'd been tacked with chaperoning. Shane was dressed as a plush pumpkin, which went down well with the old women whose doors we'd knock on. They'd all target him like a guided missile, cooing and pinching his cheeks. Apart from one. 

Her name was Esther, and she had scared me ever since I was a toddler. She was an old woman when my mother was a teen, and so must've been at least in her eighties when the following events occurred. Her nose was like a boney finger reaching out from her face, and covered in warts. Her eyes were small and cold, and seemed to spew hatred whenever she looked at you. She'd only ever wear these self knitted turtle neck sweaters, the quality of which declined over the years along with her cognition. I was too young to remember, but many years later my mother told me that the birthmark on my back only appeared after Esther had babysat me when I was two. Her and my grandmother were close friends at the time, but fell out shortly before her health declined and she passed away. Nowadays, Esther had no friends and no family either. She still lived alone, however, and brushed off the attempt of any concerned neighbour to have her sent to a retirement home. 

The plan was simple. We'd knock on her door and see what candy she had to give us. Depending on the standard she had to offer, we'd either take an extra handful each and leave, or, if it wasn't up to scratch, Olivia was carrying a sack full of egg cartons primed to hurl. That was the jewel in the crown of our evening, however, and we had a few hours and dozens of more houses to go before we arrived at her overgrown front porch. 

We were just recovering from an argument about banana splits when we made our way up to Gary's house. Gary was our Sunday school teacher, and went all out every Halloween. A small army of plastic skeletons were positioned around the house, along with ornamental spiders, bats, graves, coffins and a whole fake tree. A green and purple strobe light had been hidden among them, along with a smoke machine or two. Giant wads of webbing were strewn all over the house, much of which had blown away and ended up next door, which had just been moved in to by a newly wed couple. Gary stood in the warmth of his doorway, wearing a conservative sweater and holding a giant bowl of candy. He greeted each child individually, smiled from ear to ear and dropped a treat of his choosing into their bag or bucket. When we approached, his smile faltered. 

“Aren't you all a bit old for trick or treating?” He said coyly. 

“No” we all said in almost perfect unison. 

He shrugged, and began to distribute the candy among us, taking extra care to drop a full sized bar into Shane's plastic pumpkin bucket, which was almost the same size as he was. We thanked him and walked back through the makeshift graveyard to the street. As soon as we were out of Gary's view, Michael covertly swiped his little brother's candied macguffin and put it with his own stash. 

We skipped a few houses after his, as most on the street had their lights off, curtains drawn and Jack ‘o Lanterns extinguished. We started drifting from house to house at double speed, getting a few streets done within the hour. The pickings were poor, with most of them having been exhausted by the younger kids who swept through the area before the sun had even set. Still, we hit a few jackpots, especially Ms Hawley who gave out whole packets of marshmallows from her pantry. 

“Should we rock up to the hag-house?” Zach suggested as we walked. 

We exchanged glances at each other, wondering if we really had it in us to egg this old woman's house. 

“Maybe we should skip her.” David said sheepishly. 

“Oh, don't be a wuss” I told him and slapped the back of his tacky, vinyl creature from the black lagoon mask. 

“Hey man, I'm just saying!” He said defensively, “we could get, like, arrested and shit.”

“What did I just say?” I replied, giving him a flat tire. He kept trying to argue his point as he hopped forward, putting his shoe back on properly. The less we listened, the more his reasons turned into random excuses and hearsay. 

“You know she's a witch, right?” David said, weaving between the other four of us. 

“She can't be a real witch, David,” Zach said in a condescending tone. 

“She is, my brother said she is!” David rebutted. 

“If she was a witch, where's her broom? Haven't you seen Hocus Pocus?” Olivia joked. 

“She's not that type of witch!” David said, frantically trying to salvage his argument, “she, like, eats kids. I don't know.”

We laughed at him, but he kept going. 

“She eats kids and she totally does all these witchy things with symbols and stuff. My brother saw it. She's got a whole dungeon in her house!” David kept wittering on, clearly making stuff up on the spot. 

“And how would your brother know that she has a dungeon in her house?” I asked him. 

“My brother,” he said after a long pause, “she got him to mow her lawn and he saw! He, like, peeped in. Through a window, I… I think.”

We laughed again at his unsureness. 

“David, do you really…” I began, but trailed off. 

I followed Olivia's confused gaze, and saw that there was now a sixth member of the group. A kid, quite a bit shorter than even Zach, was following us. He was dressed in a yellow apron with a homemade mask, made out to be a severed and dried up human face. I didn't know how long he'd been walking with us, but he sure wasn't going to join our gang. 

“Fuck off!” I said, more annoyed with David than with the kid.

He whimpered and did just that, turning quickly and speed walking off towards the park. Michael gasped in faux shock at my language, covering Shane's ears. Shane looked confused, and, after another while of walking, asked for a piggyback. Michael, who was the oldest of us at a staggering fourteen, heaved his little brother onto his back and kept going. 

“I just think it's a bad idea,” David said after a while of silence. 

We let out a collective groan. 

“Will you just shut up about it man?” I said, frustrated, “you're just making us want to do it more.”

David slumped his shoulders, finally giving up.

We made our way through the suburban maze, stopping only to admire the occasional house that went all-out on the decorations. Most people had gone inside for the night, leaving a bowl of candy on the front porch with a never heeded “take only one” sign next to it. We gave dirty looks at any other trick or treaters we passed, as if they were personally responsible for the candy drought in the area. Eventually, as streets grew into an incline, we started to approach the shadowed house of Esther. Before we did, Michael peeled off from the rest of us. He said his goodbyes, telling us that he had to bring Shane, who was asleep on his shoulders, home. He left out the bit that he would be going to a costume party, one that none of us were invited to. Not that his poorly constructed cardboard robot would win any prizes, but I was still mad when I found out later that night.

Finally, the four of us arrived on Esther's front step. Her gothic home matched the style of this part of town, which was made up of rows of Dutch Colonial style houses. There wasn't a light on in the house, or at least none that lit up the many windows. With a heavy heart I knocked on the door and we waited. Just a few seconds later, and mere moments before I was about to suggest we leave, the door creaked open. Slowly at first, then it swung. Esther stood before us, her usual scowl plastered along a wrinkled face. Her grey-white hair was pulled back to the scalp and ended in a bun. Her infamous hooked nose was as craggy as ever. She wore a dark purple sweater, the neck reaching all the way to just under her boney chin. Her moth-bitten dull green skirt reached all the way down to the welcome mat. She smelled of dust and old magazines. 

“I'm sorry, I don't…” Esther trailed off as she greeted us. Her hawkish eyes focused on me, staring coldly into my own. After an uncomfortable silence, she spoke again. 

“Would you kiddies like some candy? It's Halloween after all,” she said, clamping her hands together. 

“...yes?” Olivia replied, unsure for the first time tonight. 

At that, Esther disappeared back into her home, the door somehow shutting behind her. The four of us looked at each other. David was the first to speak. 

“Guys I just remembered, my parents actually gave me this curfew. I'm already late, I should really get going,” he said and began down the steps. 

I grabbed his scaly collar and dragged him back onto the decking. 

“Hell no man, you can't back out now!” I said, sternly. 

He slumped his shoulders yet again, somehow. Any more and his knuckles would be grazing the ground. He sighed and turned back to look at the foreboding door with the rest of us. The white paint was aged and chipped. The brass ornamental knocker, which we had all purposefully avoided using, was fashioned in the shape of a pig's head. The door gave no hint to what evil lay beyond it. If it could speak and think, and tell us of every late night visitor that had ever passed through it, I wonder if it would've warned us. If it could, that night it would've screamed for us to run away and never come back. But that night, instead of leaving and never coming back, the three other children and I just stood staring at our shoes or rearranging our costumes. After some time, the door creaked open once again. 

Esther held a large ceramic bowl full of candy. Any fear the four of us had was immediately dispelled as we descended on it like a shoal of piranhas. Within seconds the bowl was empty and our bags were full. Not wanting to waste time, or get stuck talking to the senile old woman, we quickly thanked her and hurried away. As we reached the street and made our way across it, I looked back. I vividly remember seeing that the door had silently closed. When I noticed that Esther was now standing in the darkness of an upstairs window looking down at us, my heart skipped a beat. I remember shouting for my friends to look around too, but by the time their eyes focused on the spot, the old woman had already sunken backward into the shadows. 

“So what should I do with these?” Olivia asked the group as we walked, holding out the bag of egg cartons. 

We had expected Esther to slam the door in our faces, or any other act which would justify the egging. Although at the time we assured ourselves that it was because of our steadfast moral compass that we didn't yolk the old lady's home, it was more to do with us wanting to get away from her as soon as possible. Another Halloween night was essentially over now. We would all usually walk to our street before bidding each other farewell and returning to our homes. Once inside, I'd gorge myself through half of my trick or treat bounty before passing out. Or, at least, that's what I did the year prior. The streets were quiet now, with the younger kids all at home and most of the older kids at some party in the woods my sister mentioned to me. The only thing filling the air was our bickering, a distant siren and a classic Halloween soundtrack emanating from a nearby house. A gentle gust blew, chilling us and whisking a pile of orange leaves into a small whirlwind. A black bird flew from one of the gnarled trees that lined the street to another. I looked up at the sky, basking in my favourite night of the year. The moon was a perfect crescent, and looked like the hideous grin of some bent-necked monster. 

I reached into my bag and pulled out a fistful of loose candy. I stuffed it in my mouth and reached in for more. I withdrew a stick of laffy taffy and had to awkwardly carry my trick or treat bag as I unwrapped it. It was gone in seconds and I reached it again. This time I pulled out a large carton of milk duds, part of the bountiful stock from Esther's. Unlike my friends, I liked milk duds. This came, I reckon, from them being the only piece of my candy my sister didn't steal when I was younger. They were also a favourite of my father. Whenever my mother brought candy to hand out to trick or treaters, he'd always scalp the milk duds from her stockpile. Whenever my Halloween harvest was weak, he'd share them with me, as I usually came home to find him sat in front of the TV set with some duds and beer. I chuckled at the thought of him shouting at the screen with toffee stuck in his teeth and opened the box. 

There was a tape inside. I stopped walking and frowned. Once my friends noticed my immobility, they stopped too and asked me what was up. I slid the tape from the sticky box and inspected it. Bear in mind that when I was 12, DVDs were only starting to take ground and I still watched all my favourite movies on VHS. I knew what it was, and knew that judging from its smaller size, it was made for a camcorder. 

“Hey guys, look at this!” I said, dangling the tape in front of my friends. 

“What's that?” David asked. Olivia punched his shoulder. 

“It's a tape, stupid” She said. 

“I know what it is, I mean where did you get it?” Retorted David. 

“It was inside of a box of milk duds, the one I got at Esther's” I explained to them. 

“What?” Zach said, confused. 

The walk back to our cul-de-sac was spent bickering over the nature of the tape, what was on it and where it really came from. As we neared our houses, we realised that the overwhelming curiosity meant we had to find out what was on it as soon as possible. I explained to my friends that I had a VHS player rigged up in my basement. Excited, David, Zach and Olivia followed me into my house, leaving the cold street behind us. My parents had a small party going, and the four of us had to squeeze past groups of adults we didn't recognise in strange costumes to get to the basement door. It opened with its usual creak and we descended the damp wooden steps. My basement had a section of it that was a makeshift lounge. By that I mean that an old carpet had been laid down next to a busted couch. Other than the foosball table, the rest of the cellar was a mess of boxes and pipes. 

My three friends collapsed onto the old sofa and began to swap their unwanted candy like they were trading cards. Zach threw me a butterfinger as I wrestled with the VHS, trying to untangle the countless wires. After they'd been sorted, I started my rummage through the nearby boxes for an adaptor case. After spilling the contents of the nearest box all over the floor, I eventually found one. I took the small tape from my pocket as I devoured the chocolate bar. I slotted it into the adaptor case and then slotted that into the machine. The ancient TV my parents kept down here, the one I'd finally managed to connect the VHS to, spurred to life. 

It began to rain not too long after we came in. The heavy pitter mixed with the dampened sounds of adults dancing drunkenly on the wooden floor upstairs. It was clear that music was being played, but was too muted to make out the words. As soon as I pressed play, a grating static joined the commotion. My three dismounted the old sofa then, and took their place on the carpet. Surrounding me, they left their candy to one side for the first time tonight. Zach and Olivia had front row seats along with me, and David crouched behind us gazing over our shoulders. There was a hypnotic sequence of flashes and beeps before the TV screen faded to black. I was at first afraid that that was it, and that our halloween mystery turned out to be nothing more than some burnt-out film. I was moments away from complaining when the static returned. It was joined by a buzz that continued for the rest of the footage. Soon, the static cut to a video feed. It was taken from a strange angle, looking from the ground up at what I guessed was a table. Beyond I could see the ceiling, which was a light beige and cracking. This image remained for around ten seconds before the footage began to wobble as, I assume, the camera was picked up. There was an abrupt cut and then a new image appeared on the screen. 

Two rusting hooks gorged through the man's shoulders. He screamed and writhed in pain. The chained hooks were his only support, and the meat around them warped unnaturally as it tried to take his body weight. He was strung up in a dank room, his feet dangling just inches above the ground. I could make out from the grainy footage that the man was not only bald, but that every source of hair had been removed from his naked body. On the concrete floor below him was a circle of some white powder. The recorder, which must've been tucked away in the corner of the ceiling to get this angle, showed just the man for half a minute. Then, a woman came into view. We could only see her from behind. Her hair was a dark black intermixed with long patches of grey. She wore a turtleneck sweater and jeans, and seemed to me to be in her late 50s or early 60s. She walked to the edge of the circle and hung her head low. The audio began to crackle and pop as she chanted. I watched mortified as the man hanging from the ceiling began to tear in two. It was a clean bisection, beginning as a red line from the featureless, scabby crotch and ripping upwards to the head. As soon as both sides met in the center of his scalp, he came apart. The two halves swung away from each other but somehow, none of the insides poured out. They hang motionless for a time before both began to scream again and writhe around as violently as a few minutes before. The screams became a deep fried buzz and the footage was consumed by static. 

The nightmare scene dissolved into blackness and was replaced by a forest. It was night, and the unending green took on a sickly grey complexion when it was lit up by a flashlight. It was completely silent, and the beam bounced wildly as whoever held the recorder ran. We stayed with this stream of shaky footage until the person behind the camera started to slow. Soon, they were still, and began to slowly turn around. They did, and we could see something moving in the bushes that had been directly behind them. A black shape emerged and came to a standstill in the small clearly. It was a goat. Where long horns had been, there were now just worn down nubs that were capped with something metallic. The footage started to rock again as the person walked towards the goat. There was a flash of white and the footage changed again. 

Despite its extreme granulation, I could make out the figure behind the harsh grey was a bloodied man strapped to a chair. The audio crackled and popped, and I soon realised those noises were coming from the man rather than the recording itself. Before anything more happened, there was another cut. Now we were in a barren bedroom of a newly occupied house. A makeshift nursery had been thrown together, but other than the cot in the center of the room, there was no real furniture. Whoever held the camcorder moved closer to the cot until they were looming over it. I could now see the baby, who was dressed in a light blue onesie. Next to the infant was a stuffed toy. That toy, I could clearly make out, was Mr Fluff, the teddy bear my aunt had crocheted and given to my mother as a gift at my christening. I was too embarrassed to admit it, but I'd slept with Mr Fluff ever since, and still did when I was twelve. 

The next few rounds of analogue footage were all of indescribable murder scenes, and other mutilations. The last rough cut transitioned to a much clearer scene. It was from a strange angle, but after staring at it for long enough my young mind deciphered it. It was of an older woman, or part of her. Her face and the right side of her body were hidden behind the cropped view of the lens. Her skin was dotted with thick, crusting warts that looked like misplaced nipples. A few dripped, leaking and oily blood. A thin, almost skeletal man was sucking from a wart protruding from her abdomen. He seemed content. Then, the screen cut to black and finally the colour of a dead channel.

In that moment, I felt the invisible hand that clutched my chin and held me steadfast in front of the TV let go. I shook my head and collapsed backward, sprawling out onto the carpet. Olivia and Zach were slouched over, crying. I looked around, and in the dim light that was only offered from the screen I could see that David was standing in the room's corner, facing the wall. I stood and wiped confused tears from my eyes. Leaving my two other anguished friends behind me I made my way to David. I put a hand on his shoulder and gave it a gentle tug. 

“David, are you ok?” I said in a broken voice. 

David silently turned after I spoke and stared manically. His eyes were wild and pained like a dying deer and gazed deep into my own. His face was half covered in shadow but even still I could tell it was masked by an understandable fear. What happened next was harder to comprehend. A black mass writhed out from under his eyelid and crawled down his cheek like a tear. Even in the darkness, I was close enough to make it out. It was a thick, black ant. Once the insect had scuttled down below his nape, another emerged. Then another. Then another. As more poured out from beneath his eyes, so did a steady stream of viscous blood. David screamed, stirring Olivia and Zach from their trauma. Before I could react, David leapt on me. I fell to the concrete floor as he came down on top of me, throttling my neck and screaming. His face was so close that his black spittal peppered my own as he wailed. His skin looked like it was peeling off. From that proximity, I could make out the clear seams. My other friends began to scream as well, out of fear rather than necessity.

The strain on my windpipe prevented me from begging for help. All I could do was wheeze. Black spots began taking over my vision as the air was cut off from my brain. David's small, sticky hands felt like an iron vice. Before he could do anymore damage, I heard a loud metallic thwack and David tumbled off me. He tried to stand, but instead fell against the stone wall. He slumped forward, and I could see blood dripping down from his brow. I looked up and saw Olivia standing over me, holding one of my father's never-used golf clubs. She helped me up, the tinfoil of her costume rustling as she did. 

“Are you ok?” She asked in a low, frightened voice. 

I tried to stoically answer ‘yes’ but physically couldn't speak. My throat was on fire and my whole head span. Behind Olivia, I saw that Zach was bent double and heaving, with a pile of puke already having been ejected onto the carpet. Something slithered around in the vomit, which, as I write this, I'm only now realising was likely a snake. I walked unsteadily to the sofa and collapsed. Olivia threw the club to the floor and announced that she was going to get an adult. She was barely half way up the stairs when she collapsed. My fear now returned in full force after a brief respite, I watched as Olivia jerked up and descended the stairs. I couldn't even yell out for help as she screamed and dived on me. Her hands went for my neck but I forced what strength I had left to the surface and grabbed her wrists, holding them at bay. I watched as clusters of teeth came loose from her mouth and clung to her chin like a baby's drool. Gradually they slid down and dropped in my lap. When she opened her mouth to scream again, I saw that her gums were now occupied by neat rows of maggots. 

Olivia had always been taller than me by quite a bit, but I still had a weight advantage. I heaved, pushing her off me. Before I could even stand, she was already on me again. This time she didn't try to choke, instead she violently started to punch. It left my lip busted and cheek bruised, but fixed my muteness as I started to scream once again. As she attacked, I heard the ear-splitting 80s Halloween music turn off. There was a distant commotion before the basement door swung open, shedding light on me. The silhouette of a group of adults clambered down the stairs. A large man grabbed Olivia and tore her off of me. A woman screamed when she saw David slumped in a large pool of blood, the skin of his face now detached and hiding behind a box in the corner of the cellar. 

The large man who had ripped Olivia away from me tried to calm her down, but was met only with her finger nails scratching their way down his cheek. He let out a shrill wail and blindly punched in front of him, a strike that connected with the tween's jaw. Olivia crumpled, unconscious or worse. Her mother cried out and dropped to her child's side. My father pushed past the growing lot of parents and hugged me, trapping me in his arms and preventing me from seeing what Zach had become. My last clear memory of that night was being led upstairs as I'm comforted by my parents until I eventually passed out. 
It's coming up to seventeen years since my childhood died along with my friends, but I'm still there most nights. No matter how thoroughly I scrub and rinse my brain with alcohol, I can never forget their faces. That night wasn't the last time I saw Esther, but the anguish of finally recounting what happened has become too great for me to [bear](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/RSfJ7T3iSX).
