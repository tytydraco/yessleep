I’ve seen all kinds of shit since I started working for Ozark Reclaim & Clear. Raccoon nests in tractor seats. Syringes in hay bales. A whole dead cow inside a collapsed shed once, just bones and teeth like somebody peeled it like an orange.

But nothing like what I found last week in the barn behind the Wells property in Marion County.

The guy who hired us was some real estate flipper out of Memphis. Said the previous owner died in 2004, the land went unclaimed, and the county finally released it. The farmhouse was collapsing, but the barn was sealed tight. Lock was welded shut, windows blacked out. He wanted it emptied, cleared, salvaged. I brought my bolt cutters and figured I’d be out before lunch.

First red flag: the lock. It wasn’t just welded, it was wrapped in rusted chain and barbed wire, with little bits of hair caught in the twists. Looked like deer fur, but I wasn’t sure.

Second red flag: the smell. Not manure, not rot. Sweet, like antifreeze or peaches left in a hot car. Thick. Clung to your nose hairs.

I should’ve called it in. Should’ve told the guy to send someone else. But I popped the lock, pulled open the sliding door, and stepped into something that hasn’t let me sleep since.

The inside looked like it had been untouched for decades. Old lanterns hung from the rafters. Mason jars lined the shelves, full of cloudy liquid and curled shapes I didn’t want to examine. There was a giant plywood circle in the center of the barn, painted with a symbol I didn’t recognize. It looked burned into the wood.

But the worst part was the chairs.

Seven of them, in a ring. All different kinds: a metal folding chair, a wicker patio lounger, a kid’s highchair. And all had the same thing bolted to the back: mirrors.

Not store-bought mirrors either. These were hand-cut shards, silver backing faded, still caked with dust and smudges. Each one pointed toward the center of the ring.

I walked around the edge, careful not to step inside. Every mirror was positioned just right, so when I looked at them, I saw a reflection of myself, but not all at once. One showed me standing. One had me bent over. One caught me mid-blink. They were all wrong, like they weren’t all showing the same moment.

Then the wind died.

I hadn’t noticed it was breezy outside until it wasn’t. The air turned heavy. Still.

Then I heard footsteps in the rafters.

Not squirrels. Not raccoons. Boots. Slow. Deliberate.

I backed toward the door and tripped over a chain I swear wasn’t there before. Hit my shoulder hard. Laid there dazed for maybe five seconds.

When I looked up, I saw myself standing in the center of the circle.

Not a reflection.

Me.

Same flannel, same busted shoulder, same bolt cutters in hand. Only his face was slack. Eyes rolled up. Jaw hanging open like a dead deer.

He took a step forward. The mirrors adjusted with him. They all shimmered like water. I heard the crackle of wood, a groan of pressure like a roof about to cave. The smell was stronger. Chemical sweet and burning.

I crawled out. I didn’t look back. I got in my truck and peeled out, almost wrecked on the gravel.

The barn door slammed shut behind me. All by itself.

I called the guy from Memphis. Told him the job was done. Didn’t care about the money. He never followed up.

Three nights ago, I passed that property on my way home. There’s a new lock on the barn.

Same rusted chain. Same barbed wire. But now there are eight chairs inside. I counted through the cracks in the wood.

Eight.

And when I looked in the rearview mirror, just for a second…

…I wasn’t sitting alone.
