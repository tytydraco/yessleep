My name is Hazel, I was born in a village unknown from the public and from which I had to flee following a disastrous [incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ptc1y/every_year_in_my_village_there_is_a_time_during/) in 2014. After years of going through ups and downs with wonderful foster parents, chaos then arose in early 2022 when I moved out to pursue my studies in another town. I settled in one of the many houses owned by the family, before the week of nightmare began.

Wednesday

Upon waking up on that winter morning, I found all the windows of the house open, but no trace of a break in and nothing stolen. This happened for two consecutive nights, making me think that the house could be haunted by an unseen entity.

Friday

Whatever or whoever the culprit was raised the bar and I woke up to find all the windows closed. However, two identical drinking glasses were carefully placed on a cushion in the middle of the corridor. When I inspected the strange set up, I noticed that one of the glasses was cracked. The same day, I decided to purchase three cameras to get evidence of the strangeness occurring in the house. I managed to install one in the kitchen, one in the living room and another one in the corridor with a good view of my bedroom door.

Saturday

That morning, I woke up and found a chair from the dining table in front of my bed, as if someone watched me sleep all night long. I got out of the bedroom to everything else seeming normal until I went to the bathroom to get the greatest shock of my life. In the sink, I found all the three cameras destroyed whereas on the mirror, ominous things had been written with my nail polish:

'Nice try Hazel'

'What else before I kill you?'

After fleeing the house, I phoned my uncle Dane, a retired police officer in that same town, and he went to the house to investigate. Nothing made sense to him too as they were no sign of anyone breaking into the residence. However, after I spent two days at his place, he displayed a strange confidence, reassuring me and encouraging me to return to the house, which I did on Tuesday evening, and found the house clean and untouched.

Wednesday

I opened my eyes, gasped and almost jumped when I found uncle Dane and my foster parents sitting next to the bed.

"Uncle Dane? Dad? Mom but— what—?"

"Hey sweetie! We came as fast as we could when your uncle called us. Sweetie we need to talk." My dad spoke as my mom began sobbing.

"What? What's going on?" I asked.

"Hazel, I put a hidden camera in the living room after what you told me. This what happened last night. I think— you just have to see for yourself." Uncle Dane said, handing me his phone.

Beating harder than a drum, my heart filled up with fear as I launched the video. It did not have the best resolution, but I could still see the intruder emerge from the corridor as if she came from my bedroom. With a very masculine voice, she mumbled inaudible things but stopped when she spotted the hidden camera in the corner of the living room. My heart sank and my eyes widened when she approached to inspect the device. She was walking with her eyes closed and of course it could not prevent anyone to recognize her. It was me.
