I haven’t slept in days, and I’m typing this at 4 AM because I’m too scared to close my eyes. I’m 28, live alone in a rundown apartment with paper-thin walls, and my girlfriend, Mia, stays over a couple times a week. Last Friday, something happened that’s got me questioning my sanity, and I need to tell someone before I lose it completely.

Mia came over after work, and we were chilling with some takeout and Netflix. One thing led to another, and we ended up in my bedroom, lights off, getting, uh, intimate. I’m not gonna overshare, but let’s just say we were caught up in the moment, tangled in the sheets, and I was feeling pretty good. The room was dead quiet except for us, or so I thought. Right as things were heating up, I heard a whisper—sharp and cold, right in my ear: “Slow down.” It was so clear I froze, thinking Mia was messing with me. I pulled back, looked at her, and she was staring at me, confused, like, “What’s wrong?” I asked if she said anything, and she swore she didn’t. Her face was blank, maybe a little annoyed I stopped. I laughed it off, blaming my imagination, and we kept going, but I couldn’t shake this uneasy feeling.

A few minutes later, it happened again. Another whisper, slower and raspier: “Not like that.” My heart slammed in my chest. Mia didn’t react, still moving with me, so I knew she didn’t hear it. I scanned the room—nothing but shadows and the faint glow of streetlights through the blinds. My stomach twisted, but I didn’t want to freak her out, so I mumbled something about needing a break and got up to check the apartment. Doors locked, windows shut, nobody else here. Mia was pissed, thinking I was dodging her, but I convinced her to stay the night, mostly because I was too spooked to be alone.

Around 2 AM, I woke up to Mia shaking me, her voice trembling: “Did you hear that?” I was groggy, but then I heard it—a low, guttural voice from the corner of the room: “She’s not yours.” We both screamed, flipped on the light, and there was nothing. No one. Just my shitty IKEA dresser and a pile of laundry. Mia grabbed her stuff and bolted, saying she’s never coming back. I tried to stop her, but she was gone before I could explain.

Since then, it’s gotten worse. Every night, I hear that whisper—sometimes it’s “Slow down,” sometimes it’s my name, drawn out like a hiss. Last night, I felt something cold brush my leg under the covers, and I swear the mattress dipped like someone sat down. I checked my building’s records online. A guy lived here 10 years ago, died in this apartment—heart attack in his sleep, right in this bedroom. I don’t know if it’s him, but I’m moving out next week. My lease is up, and I can’t take this anymore. Mia’s not answering my texts, and I’m sleeping on the couch with every light on. Has anyone dealt with something like this? I’m scared it’ll follow me.
