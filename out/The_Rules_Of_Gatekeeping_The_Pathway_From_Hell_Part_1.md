I’ve never been religious or believed in ghosts, demons or anything other spiritual beings. Until recently that is, you see I’ve been the gatekeeper of what I think is the only path out of hell, this might sound crazy to most of you and trust me I can barely believe it myself but after the horrible things I’ve seen there’s no other explanation.

I say there during the evening the day before I turned 20 when I was scrolling through job listings and found an ad for a groundskeeper at one of the floral gardens just on the outskirts of town. Perfect! I thought, I’ve always been more of a night person anyway so it’ll fit me to a tea so I applied for it. It didn’t even take 20 minutes until I got a call on my phone which read “Unknown caller” I picked up.

“It’s Jackie” I said to it confusion.

“Ah yes I’m Gabriel, the manager for the groundskeeping position” a man with a deep and confident voice

“Oh that was quick, how can I help you” I said

“Oh we really need this position filled so I ‘m quick with calling up the applicants as soon as I can, so can you start tonight?” Gabriel said enthusiastically

I didn’t have much to do tonight anyway so I said “of course” there were some basic questions but nothing out of the ordinary. We finished up the interview and I got directions to the place and who to meet up with.

“You’re a godsend” said Gabriel before hanging up.

I packed up my things and checked on my bike before I headed out. It wasn’t too long of a trip around 45 minutes on the bike. I arrived at the floral garden and I hadn’t seen anything like it, there was a large gate standing right at the edge of the garden with a pathway leading to it, I checked my notes one last time before going up to the gate.

*11:30PM by the gate meet up with Cherub*

“Alright let’s see then” I said to myself while walking up to the gate.

I had almost reached the gate when I heard a voice behind me.

“Hey you, what are you doing here!”

I turned around a bit startled

“Oh them, I’m suppose to start here today, I’m the new groundskeeper for the night!” I said with the friendliest smile I could muster.

“Oh my apologies, didn’t mean to scare you I thought you were something else, My name’s Cherub, I’m the day keeper, you can call me “C”

“No worries” I said with a little chuckle.

“So should we get started?” Cherub asked with a welcoming wave.

We walked around the grounds and “C” showed me some places, I’ve never seen such a beautiful place, flowers, trees and perfectly taken care of. In the middle of a circular pathway stood a large and old Apple tree filled with pink flowers but no apples. I don’t know what it was but I felt at peace, no worries that troubled me, we continued along the path until we came to a small cottage with large windows looking towards the grounds.

“Here we are! This is where you’ll spend the nights, It’s usually not a lot of action going on, so there’s some books for you in there if you like to read” Cherub chirped

“Oh well I should get going” I said and we went our separate ways.

I walked up to the cottage and there were a sign above the door with latin text on it. I continued in not thinking more of it and got settled. The inside of the cabin was small there was a desk with a computer and 2 screens. Next ot the computer was a crinkled up note laying there right on the side of the desk.

"*Good evening to you replacement keeper, I want to be very clear with you that this is not some joke written to you by management or Cherub. Now listen to me, there are some rules you have to follow when keeping these grounds and I can’t stress how important these are.*

*Rule number 1: Do not listen to the whispers, they’re lying.*

*Rule number 2: Always make your rounds at 2-3AM never before never later, and whatever you do, don’t stay out later then 3:15AM the whispers wants to be alone*

*Rule number 3: if you happen to see a small old man with a beat up hat and coat standing by the gate tell him politely, “I’m sorry sir, Eden’s closed this hour please come back tomorrow”*

*Rule number 4: if the lights start to flicker in your booth take the whole water on your desk and cover yourself with it quickly. When the lights go out it will be too late.*

*Rule number 5: Don’t trust anyone besides Cherub, he’s the guardian.*

*Rule number 6: if you see someone during your patrol trying to break through the gate, you must kill them before they break through.*

*I wish I could help more then this but even I didn't know all the rules yet, you see if you're reading this I'm already dead, hence you being my replacement, I just wish you don't have to see me here on the gate from hell.*"

"What the fuck?!" I blurted out.

This couldn't be true!  No, no way this is real, it's gotta be a joke. I continued reading the note that was left.

"*There are lost souls and demons running around in these forests trying to get out of hell, you see this is the lust garden, yes the one from the bible. The beginning of mans lust, the perfect place for the only way out of hell. You might be wondering what I died from. you see I learned the 6th rule just yesterday, I managed to stagger the fucker but it survived and ran out into the forest... to the whispers. Just follow the rules kid, if you don't, you'll end up like me."*

I didn't know what to think I checked the time.

"Shit, it's 1:40am, I just got here it couldn't be 1:40 yet" I said to myself.

I looked around and found another note with a shotgun.

"*This is your only line of defence, it will help, it's proven"*

I grabbed the shotgun and worked up the courage to grab the door knob.

"alright, come on Jackie, you can do this, you can do this, no problem" I looked over at the clock.

*1:59am*

The clock turned 2am, I opened the door and gripped the shotgun even harder. I walked my way around keeping to the pathway, It was dead silent outside but it was something weird with the sky, there were no moon, no stars and no...sky? It was all red, blood red. where the fuck had I gone, I continued through the garden as I heard it, the whispers.

"*Jaaaccccsskkiiee"*  A voice said from the night. it was so dark I couldn't see anything.

"*I know you can hear me, come here and take a little resssssttt with me"* The sound was like a whisper, a hiss of sorts, I didn't hear it, it just sounded in my head.

"Ignore the whispers ignore the whispers" I though to myself. I started to panic a bit, it wasn't a joke it's real I continued walking It didn't take long until I had arrived at the opvergrown gate that I just earlier today had walked through, how could this be possible. But I didn't have much time to think about it cause there, right there stood the man described in the rules. a short man with worn clothing a hat and a coat to go with it. I walked slowly up to him and nervously said.

"Excuse me, I'm sorry sir, Eden's closed this hour please come back tomorrow"

The man turned around and looked straight up at me, or I think he did atleast cause instead of eyes there were sockets with maggots crawling out of them, his cheakbone was hanging on by the corner of his lower jaw and with a crackling and raspy voice he said:

"Oh I'm so sorry boy, I was sure I had the right time"

The man tipped his hat and walked off into the night without a fuss. I continued on with my rounds around the garden and when I made it back to the house I noticed something different, the sign wasn't above the doorframe anymore. I stopped dead in my tracks. This didn't feel good at all, I looked around and saw a pair of eyes behind the cottage, they shined bright and large like rubies.

"*Ohhh come on in now, don't be ssssscccared now jackie"* That same whisper echoed in my head, I tried to ignore it but it grew louder and louder. I looked at the time, Fuck, 02:55AM shit shit shit I need to find my way back to the cottage.

"*Run run run little mouse"* The whisper continued while chuckling hystrerically like I was running towards it's trap.

"What the fuck is this place!" I yelled out while trying to find my way back ot the cottage. There it was the familiar cottage with the sign fuck yes it had the sign. I've never ran like that before, I got to the cottage and ripped the door open and slammed it shut as fast as I could.

"*That was a close one little mouse, That was a very close one"* it hissed almost disappointed.  I looked at the time, 3:13AM. It was right it was a close one, I didn't even have time to think about it before the light started flickering.

"*Knock knock, Jackie"* Said the creature in a demonic voice.

I practically threw myself trowards the water bottle and poured it all over myself.

The light continued to flicker and just when the water hit me the lights went out. A silence filled the room and after what felt like forever the door squeaked open.

"*You don't know what you've walked into have you now jackie...welcome to the passage for the undead. the only way to escape hell, and you're the only one standing between us and freedom. You can't take that away from us."*

I felt a sharp pain on my arm, almost like dozens of razor blades cutting my arm up. 

"Fuck!" I said in pain. I could feel my blood running down my arm and dripping from my fingertips. 

That's when the lights flickered back on. The door stood open but there were scales left behind, like small diamonds they laid on the floor around me. I quickly made my way to the first-aid kit on the wall next to the screens. I patched myself up and I didn't walk out of that cottage anymore that night. 

6AM came and Cherub came through the cottage door. I practically jumped up from the chair.

"Wo wo, Easy there tiger" Cherub said raising his hands with a chuckle.

"What is this place!" I yelled at him angry at this point.

"Oh Gabriel hasn't told you.." He lowered his hands and his expression turned serious.

"This is the only way to earth. where demons make their way to the real world, we're the gatekeepers..." Cherub continued.

"Legends and religions have been started from this place, it's as old as time itself, christianity called it the garden of lust. Adam and Eve the first two humans." Cherub said while looking at me to make sure I followed.

"Anyway, Adam and Eve was the first gatekeepers, not the first humans, that's where they got it wrong. By the looks of it you've already met the Nahas, He's a snake of sorts, sometimes something else. He's a deciever, do not trust him he's taken tons of keepers." He said now slightly saddene, I just nodded slowly trying to take it all in.

"I get it if you don't want to work here anymore, it's not for everyone. but it's needed. sadly." He said looking concerned

I walked past Cherub without saying anything, took my bike and biked home. So here I am in my apartment writing this, I haven't decided if I'll continue my gatekeeping job, but what I do know is that  Ihad en envelope waiting for me at home with a note. 

"P*ayment for the first night Jackie, here's your first payment I hope to see you tonight at 11:30 sharp, we're all counting on you"*

And there in the envelope was no money I've seen. It was a large golden coin with blue rubies on it. I recognized the text it was the same latin as was displayed on the sign if I do decide to go back to my gatekeeping job I need to recover after this past night of no sleep
