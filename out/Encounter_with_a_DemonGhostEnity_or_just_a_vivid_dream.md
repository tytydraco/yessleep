 

To start of here, my name is Alex

I wanna share a little story/encounter i had.

Little back story here,

Me and my girlfriend bought a small appartement for us an our daughter back in oktober 2021.

Before we could move in we had to do some renovations, as laying a new floor , painting the walls ect.... Once we were done we moved in around the mids of november. Its a small 2 bedroom apparment on the first floor of a big block . It's not big but it's cozy to give a little inside of how the apparments layout is you come in trough the front door in to a small hallway where as you stand in front of the front door to you back you see one door infront of you ( daughters room) 3 doors to your left one is the master bedroom , one for the toilet and one for the bathroom. then next to the front door there is a small window and next to it the door to the dining room/living room and kitchen. and on the left there hangs a mirror. So as most of you would now when you start renovating on a small window of time not everything is finished as so it was in our apparment. The door to go to the dining/living room wasn't done so we removed the door to get it ready for the paint job ect....

We always sleep with our bedroom door open for our daughter so we can hear her when she wakes up or when se has a bad dream or stuff it gives us a more safe feeling towards our daughter so.

But this means i sleep on the door side of the room and i can see in the hall way en the mirror that is in the hall way so one night i woke up around 2am and i saw that the light in the bathroom was still on ( i could see it in the mirror in the hallway) i look beside me and saw my girlfriend laying next to me so i tought maybye one of us forgot te turn of the light in the bathroom when we went to sleep. I tought nothing of it and got up and first went to the toilet and as i was sitting on the toilet with the door slighty open i looked in the mirror with a sleeping head and i tought i saw something move in the bathroom under crack of the door ( the door wasn't fully closed so i thought its probably one of our cats.

 As i got off the toilet and whent outside the door i looked again in the mirror and saw in the crack of the door a figure thats when my heart started raising and pounding faster, i shook my head and try to brush it of as if i'm sleep drunk you know. So i moved slowly to the bathroom door and when on to open the door at that moment i almost jump troug the sealing cause my two cats where now sitting next to me and staring at the door. I look down to them and petted them on the head but they didn't move (normaly if i do that they keep asking for more attention but they didn't the just stared blankly at the bathroom door) so thats when i paused for a second to look back in the mirror and thats when i saw in the crack a face, looking at me trough the mirror , i rubbed my eyes and turned my head towards the door and opened it with a fast and hard push and when i opened it i saw my self standing in the bathroom looking towards my mirror and sink in the bathroom.

 That's the moment i fully froze and had the feeling i couldn't move or speak or yell my heart racing in my chest. I tried to go away or close my eyes and hoping this was all a dream but i couldn't do anything. Then it turned to me and just told me,'' keep doing what your doing your doing the right thing for now.''

 When it finished saying these exact words to me i then could close my eyes and when i opend them again it was gone. So i turned the lights out as fast as i could closed the door took the cats en went back to my bed to get under the blankeds and try to fall a sleep as fast as i could i can only remember seeing at the alarm clock it was still 2am and then i woke up around 7am by the alarm to get up with my girlfriend to take our daughter to school. So i didn't told anything to my girlfriend about this encounter cause i tought i was just having a bad dream or something. Cause in the past i had been to a sleeping clinic cause i dream alot and always felt tired when i woke up even tough i have enough hours of sleep so. They blamed it cause i lay on my back ect.... But anyways back to the story so i woke up did my moring routine with my girlfriend and daughter and we set of the bring our little girl to school. In the car thats when i knew it wasn't a dream and it really happend was because of my girlfriend saying to me. Honey did you leave the lights on again in the bathroom? Cause i saw you getting up last night to go and put them out. I look at her with a pale face and just nodded and didn't tell anything to here cause i don't want her to think i'm getting crazy maybe. For the record i do not and did not take any medication nor did i drink alcohol of such. But yeah thats the first encounter i had.

 Now we fast forward a couple of weeks. So a few week later, i was up late cause i had the late shift ( working from 2pm until 10pm) so i came home around half past 10 and everyone was already a sleep cause my girlfriend had to wake up early to do the early shift at 5 am. I had my dinner as usual when that stood ready for me in the microwave and set behind my computer to play some video games and watch some youtube videos at around half past 12 i when to bed but first i would always go check on our daughter and give her a kiss and then i know everything is oke and i went to do my routine to go to bed. 

So i got next to my girlfriend i cuddle her very gently and fell asleep almost instant. I was sleeping pretty good and around 4am i woke up and i was laying with my back to the door and i still had my arm around my girlfriend. I gave her a kiss on the back of her head en turned around , thats when i say (cause of the door thats always open of our bedroom) that there was light in the livingroom. I didn't think much of it so i stood up when to the toilet looked back at my girlfriend in bed trough the mirror in the hallway when i heard i sound coming from the kitchen. Then my heart started pounding again and the first incident witch at this point i was actually forgotten. But then it came back to me at that point and i knew instantly it was not one of my cats cause when i stood up to go to the toilet i saw them both lying on the foot of our bed so i took the first thing that i could get my hands on in the hallway ( witch was a broom) and when as silent as i can to the kitchen ready to attack this time. 

When i came around the table at the opening of the kitchen i was ready to swing it like a real champ and when i did i stopped immediately cause it was my girlfriend who was standing there fully dressed for work and shaking by me cause is was almost attacking here. Se looked scared at me and asked if everything was oke with me. I looked at here and immediately touched her to see if she was real and she was and i asked her what she was doing here at the middle of the night she looked at me confused and told me she was getting ready to go to work and then i ran to the bedroom and went to look who i kissed then and who was next to me but the bed was empty she followed me and asked me what i was doing and then i told her she was freaked out herself and told me she was already up from half past 4 so nobody was next to me since then but i was sure and i'm still sure at this day that something or somebody was lying next to me and she looked exactly as my girlfriend. And until this day nothing ever happend like that except sometimes i have the feeling that someone or something is on my terras at night or when i have my headphones on and im playing a game or doing some work on my computer and everyone is a sleep i still hear my name called out to me trough out my headphones. So yeah guys this is a little story of my own. And one of the many reasons why i'm in to such things.

Thanks for reading.

You never know what can happen at night so stay safe people.
