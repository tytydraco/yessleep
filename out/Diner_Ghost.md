It was my first venture into the workforce. Since freshman year, I'd been counting down the days since I could get my license. When I turned sixteen, I passed my driver's test with flying colors. Actually getting a car of my own was another matter. I didn't grow up in a financially stable environment. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Our parents were employed, but between expenses, there wasn't much left over, so I wanted to get a job right away. Luckily for me, my older brother, Spencer, had already been working at our town's local diner since the previous year. I asked him if he could see about getting me hired there. While he couldn't guarantee anything, he did tell me he would see what he could do. His good word with the owner paid off and I was scheduled for an interview the following weekend.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The diner in question is called Claude's, named after the original owner. As an aside, that family had a tradition of giving the sons that name. It was Claude IV who interviewed me. I went with Spencer who drove us in his rusty pickup truck. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Is there anything I should know before we go in?" I asked as we pulled in.

&#x200B;

"Yeah, four," Spencer replied, putting his truck in park. "First off, make sure you always maintain eye contact. Second, be nice to customers. Third, be proactive and lastly, never tell anyone exactly how many tips you got. Do all that and you should be good."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I followed his advice as I talked to Claude, never letting my gaze wander. I answered his questions as best I could. Honestly, during our conversation, I got the immediate sense that this guy wasn't exactly trustworthy. I can't explain why other than that there was this used car salesman vibe to him. Now I was beginning to see why Spencer told me what he did.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I briefly wondered if maybe I should decline and try to find a job elsewhere. However, I figured that Spencer had already gone through the trouble to convince Claude to interview me, I should see it through.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Well, Dale, your brother did say you work hard in school. Tell me, can you bring that kind of energy here?" he asked, flashing a weasel-like smile.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Yeah, of course, I'll give a hundred percent."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Then you can start right away."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He extended a hand and I shook it, noting how greasy it felt. We walked out of his office and into the kitchen where Spencer was getting ready to carry out some breakfast plates of eggs and bacon. Claude called his attention.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Hey, your brother got the job," he informed him. "When you get done with that, I need you to show him the ropes."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There wasn't much to go over. The main things were where the break room was and not to stand in front of the door connecting the kitchen to the dining area. It only took me about a week to learn just how shitty people were. It seemed like every other shift someone would complain about something or another. I lost count of how many plates got sent back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't know what they were expecting. It's not like it was a five-star restaurant. I guess that environment just creates a sense of entitlement in people. Regardless, I tolerated it. Admittedly, some instances required me to bite my tongue, but I managed to keep my cool. Slowly yet surely, my fruits bore labor and I was on my way to being able to purchase my first vehicle, albeit used.

&#x200B;

Spencer and I couldn't be the only servers there so we worked alongside a couple other people. One was Spencer's friend, Angelo from art class and the other was Claude IV  who everybody called Chip. He was the polar opposite of his dad. In contrast to his time to lean time to clean attitude, he was a pretty chill guy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He told us that his parents are divorced because his dad got caught with the mail lady and then after a confrontation involving Stilettos and resulting in him getting a black eye, he was kicked out of the house. He got Chip on the weekends who he made work for free. Unbeknownst to him, he would swipe money before he got a chance to count it. Needless to say, he wasn't exactly fond of the man, but having an aversion to conflict, he tried to get along with him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Summer break came around. By that point, I'd been working there for a little over six months and I had finally managed to snag a car off Craigslist. Now it was just a matter of paying for insurance and saving up for college or trade school. That was the others' plan too. Little did I know just how bad those months were, closely followed by Spring Breakers.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The main reason we despised the Summer people is that nothing is ever good enough for them. Not to discriminate, but this tended to come from old people. No matter how hard we worked or how patient we were, they would ramble on about how our generation was lazy and disrespectful. The irony wasn't lost on us. It was at the beginning of June when I found out that there was more than meets the eye to the diner. It held a dark secret which given the barely passing health inspection scores wasn’t that surprising.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

However, this went far beyond using just expired food. Chip explained it to me one stormy night. We were getting ready to close up as thunder could be heard outside followed by drizzling raindrops. I was cleaning the lobby. Spencer and Angelo were doing the dishes. Meanwhile, Chip was counting money. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Once I gave a thorough sweep and then mopped it down, I went to him and asked if he needed anything else.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Let me check,” he said then yelled into the kitchen. “Hey, have you guys gotten to the fryers yet?”

&#x200B;

“No, there’s a lot of dishes here. It might be a while,” Angelo called back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chip turned back to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yeah, you can go help with that.”

&#x200B;

“Wait, but I’ve never done that before.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He paused his counting.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh yeah, well, just let me finish this up and I’ll show you. It’s pretty easy as long as you’re careful.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When he was done, we headed into the kitchen where I had a near accident. I wasn’t prepared for how slippery the floor was and I ended up losing my balance and nearly falling face-first into the fryer. Thankfully, the prep table was nearby and by flailing, I managed to grab hold of it. With my heart rate significantly increased, I straightened myself out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Shit, dude, are you okay?” Spencer asked.

&#x200B;

“I nearly burned my face off. What do you think?” I snapped.

&#x200B;

“Fuck man, you have to be more careful,” Chip scolded.

&#x200B;

“Maybe give me a little heads up next time. Why is the floor so damn slippery anyway?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Angelo seemed to remember something embarrassing. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That was my bad. I spilled some bacon grease earlier and forgot to clean it up. Honestly, we’re lucky nobody had an accident sooner.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When Chip glared at him, he added, “Sorry, I’ll be more on top of things in the future.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chip only shook his head and got back to me. Learning how to clean the fryer didn't take long. Earlier mishap aside, I got it down pretty quickly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“And all that's left to do is have a fresh container ready to fill it in the morning," he said, placing one on the adjacent containers.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

By then, Spencer and Angelo were also finishing up. He went to a nearby sink to wash his hands.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"By the way, make sure you get some slip-proof shoes. We don't want you ending up like Baxter."

&#x200B;

"Who?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Everyone stared at me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You know, Baxter Reed?" Spencer said.

&#x200B;

"No? I've never heard of him."

&#x200B;

"Wow, he's been here all this time and nobody told him," Angelo chimed in. "Should we tell him then?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 Chip glanced outside where the storm was now raging.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I suppose this is ideal weather for a scary story."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Back in the lobby, Chip stood behind the counter while the rest of us sat on the barstools. He stared with a hard expression plastered across his face as he recounted the story of Baxter Reed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

According to him, he was born in the town hospital back in the 40s and life went downhill for him from there. In addition to being a preborn baby, he was physically weak which in turn made his dad resent him and smack him around in an attempt to toughen him up. His mom didn't do anything to help either.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Wow, poor guy," I interjected.

&#x200B;

"You don't know the half of it," Chip said. "If he didn't get punches at home, he was getting them at school. Usually, he got both. People like him tend to be easy targets."

&#x200B;

"Did he have anything going for him?"

&#x200B;

"As a matter of fact, he did. The dude was crazy smart and I mean a real poindexter. He'd probably be doing great right now if he'd been born around our time. Sadly, it wasn't in the cards for him. Life kept beating him down."

&#x200B;

"That sucks and all, but what does that have to do with the fryer?"

&#x200B;

"I'm getting to that, have some patience."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Seeing that Chip was annoyed, I piped down.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"As I was saying, nothing ever went right for Baxter and it was in this very restaurant he met his untimely end.”

&#x200B;

“You mean he…Died here?” I hesitantly said, feeling bits of apprehension creep in.

&#x200B;

“That’s right and man, was his all kinds of fucked. My grandpa was the one in charge of this place at the time and much like my dad, he wasn’t too concerned with employment safety so long as he didn’t get sued. Anyway, Baxter’s dad left him and his mom and his sixteenth birthday, and since she couldn’t work, he needed money where he could get it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Given the circumstances, I understood why Baxter’s mother couldn’t hold down a job. Chip went on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So, my grandpa hired him and he worked here for nearly two years.”

&#x200B;

“What was he planning to do?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chip shrugged.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Probably save up and move like us. Too bad he never got the chance.”

&#x200B;

“Let me guess, the fryer?”

&#x200B;

“Bingo, one night during a dinner rush, he slipped and fell into the oil head first. If that wasn’t bad enough, apparently, it was heated up too much and he died on the way to the hospital.”

&#x200B;

“That’s awful. Don’t get me wrong, but what’s so scary about it? So far, it seems more like a cautionary tale.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chip drummed his fingers on the counter as if mentally preparing himself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That’s not where the story ends. Rumor has it that his mom was heavily into the occult before she married his dad.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My hands curled on the counter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You mean like a Wiccan?”

&#x200B;

“I don’t think it’s ever been specified. Baxter’s funeral was the week after his accident and since his dad skipped town, she was the only one who attended, but she had other plans. She stole the body.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That took me aback. However, I did wonder if it was technically stealing since she was his mother.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You’re kidding?”

&#x200B;

“Nope, people around town have been talking about it for years.”

&#x200B;

“Then why haven’t I heard of it?”

&#x200B;

“You hardly get out,” Spencer told me.

&#x200B;

“Oh, well, I guess that explains it.”

&#x200B;

“Right,” Chip continued, “so she wanted to use her son’s corpse in some kind of ritual, possibly one she thought would bring him back to life.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Although I could sympathize with her, such actions appalled me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What did she do exactly?” I asked, cautiously curious.

&#x200B;

“The details are vague, but basically she still owned some books on the subject. One of them contained a blood ritual that she attempted to pull off. The day after the funeral, she was found dead with a self-inflicted throat in the middle of a ceremonial circle with candles surrounding it.”

&#x200B;

“And Baxter?”

&#x200B;

“Her blood got on him. The most fucked up thing about it is that the people who found her said that she was smiling.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was a lot to take in. Now, I’ve heard of some messed up true crime before, but this was up there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What happened after that?”

&#x200B;

“Hey, you catch on quick.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chip explained that after their burial, shit started to go wrong for the people who tormented them. Baxter’s bullies all died under mysterious circumstances within the year. All of them vary in how they happened. Some were caused by car accidents. Others were because they picked on the wrong people and some burned like him. The weirdest was his dad who according to his obituary, died of a heart attack.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His autopsy showed no abnormalities that would’ve caused it either. The muscle simply ceased to function.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What happened to this place?” I asked.

“Lots of accidents and shit falling apart. Even equipment that wasn’t that old or even brand new would malfunction. One customer was injured from a lamp falling on his head. Things got so bad people refused to come and my grandpa had to shut this place down for a while.”

&#x200B;

“Did the curse stop when he did?”

&#x200B;

“How did you know?”

&#x200B;

“Isn’t that how it usually works with these kinds of things?”

&#x200B;

“Indeed, and I’m sure you’ve already guessed where I’m going with this. On the night of the reopening, Baxter himself appeared.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I gave a skeptical stare. Up until then everything was unusual and improbable. However, it wasn’t impossible. There were similar stories such as what happened to the cast of the Poltergeist movies and probably many other instances. Nonetheless, I kept my opinion to myself and let Chip continue.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I know how it sounds, but there are people who were there on that night who said they heard him, crystal clear..”

&#x200B;

“But nobody actually saw him?”

&#x200B;

“One person did in the bathroom mirror. They said his face was burnt and he had on the same uniform he died in.”

&#x200B;

“Then what happened? Did he make shit float around and smash some dishes?”

&#x200B;

“No, he didn’t show himself to anyone else. Instead, he left a message to my grandpa.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I went from skeptical to mildly intrigued.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Your grandpa? What did he tell him?”

&#x200B;

“That if this place wasn’t gone within sixty years after his accident  that he would return for the blood of his family.”

“So you?”

&#x200B;

“Or my dad.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I did some quick mental math.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Wait, you said sixty years. How long has it been since then?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chip smiled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Funny you should bring that up. The sixtieth anniversary, if you want to call it that, of the incident is in a week. That should give you something to look forward to. Anyway, I hope you all have a safe trip home.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With that, we left. During the following week, I did consider asking around town to verify parts of the story. Not wanting to expend unnecessary effort, though I decided it wasn’t worth going out of the way for. I did have to admit to myself that some parts of the story did stick with me. In fact, I was a bit apprehensive to work on the night of the anniversary. However, I knew that would only show the others that the story had gotten to me so I showed up without complaint.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We still got the same number of customers which didn’t bode well for the story. If people believed it, shouldn’t they be avoiding Claude’s? Then I began to notice a drastic shift as it got closer to sunset. People seemed in a hurry to eat their food and then get out of there. I shrugged this off, figuring they were just eager to get home.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chip’s dad left halfway into our shifts to go play poker, saying that he was feeling lucky so it was only the four of us. We tended to our usual duties and I, now in slip-resistant shoes, was helping Spencer with the dishes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, I need to take a leak. Mind if I step away?” he asked.

&#x200B;

“Go ahead.”

&#x200B;

He left and I finished up. When I did, Chip called me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Dale, can you take out the trash?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced outside, briefly feeling like Spongebob in the Night Shift episode.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yeah, sure. Anything else?”

&#x200B;

“No, that should do.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Gathering the trash in the lobby, I went outside, trying to keep an unbothered demeanor. Then I tossed the bags into the dumpster. As I was getting around, I heard something that made my neck hairs stand on end.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Need…Revenge."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I spun around and screamed. Baxter's ghost stood in front of me, wearing the clothes he died in and with his face burned. I couldn't do more than let out a squeak as he reached toward me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Must pay.." he continued. "Blood…"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His voice was that of a perpetual chain smoker. I booked it, wanting to grab my keys inside and get out of there. Baxter was giving which only further increased my fear and confusion when another Baxter popped up in front of the door. Cursing, I nearly ran into him, but managed a sliding stop and changed course, heading to the front of the diner. It didn't dawn on me to wonder where the others were as I went inside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Relieved I managed to lose the Baxter ghosts, I spotted my keys on the counter and went to grab them. When I did, a hand shot up from under the counter, grabbing my wrist. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Revenge…"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Baxter's head rose up. The smell was awful like burnt moldy cheese. Yelling, I was able to pull away and back up only to bump into the two other Baxters from before. I was surrounded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Pay in blood," they rasped in unison.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"No, please," I begged, searching for some way out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My back was to the wall. They came closer. Then I heard one of them begin to laugh along with the others soon after. Instantly, my intense fear turned to burning anger.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You fucking pieces of shit," I screamed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Spencer, Angelo, and Chip pulled their masks off, doubling over and holding their sides.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You should have seen your face," Chip howled, wiping a few tears away.

&#x200B;

"We had this planned all week," Angelo explained between giggles. "We even made these masks by gluing burnt pizza cheese to them."

&#x200B;

"Well, I hope it was worth it, assholes because I'm covering any more of your shifts," I snapped.

&#x200B;

"Don't be a pussy," Spencer told me. "It was just a harmless prank."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Reluctantly I agreed and told them I was going to head out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Wait, before you go can you grab some Lysol from the back?" Chip asked. "Don't worry. I promise we won't try anything else."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Drawing in a breath of frustration, I went to the back to grab a can. Opening the closet, I saw another Baxter ghost glaring down at me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Fuck off," I said, rolling my eyes and then slamming the door.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Storming back into the lobby, I confronted Angelo and Chip.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Really, you mother fuckers just had to try to get another cheap shot on me?"

&#x200B;

"What are you talking about?" Angelo replied.

&#x200B;

"Yeah, we've been here the whole time," Chip added.

&#x200B;

"Oh yeah? Then where's Spencer?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He came from the bathroom, drying his hands on his apron. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What's the matter with you?" he asked me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My apprehension was returning.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Hang on. If you're all here, then who did I see in the…?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Everyone's eyes suddenly grew huge and I got the feeling they weren't pulling my leg this time. Slowly, I turned. It was Baxter, the real Baxter, standing before us. How I knew for sure this wasn't a prank was the fact he was floating. Furthermore, his face was hideously disfigured from burns, and his uniform was covered in grease stains.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Raising a finger, he pointed it at Chip.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Time's up," he said to him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chip's words caught in his throat. Baxter stared at us and noticed the masks on the counter. His hands clenched into fists.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"How dare you?" he roared. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The lights hummed as he got more agitated. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Run," I screamed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We attempted to head for the door, but Baxter flew in front of it, giving us no choice other than running to the kitchen. The back door would've been our next choice if Baxter didn't start making dishes fly around the room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"In here, quick," Angelo urged, gesturing to the walk-in fridge.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We were able to get inside and lock it before Baxter noticed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"That's a ghost," I said in stunned fright, "a real ghost."

&#x200B;

"Yeah,  we all saw him. Keep your voice down," Chip hissed. 

&#x200B;

"What are we going to do?" Angelo asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A sudden pounding came from the door.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I know you're in here, Claude," Baxter said from the other side.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We all went quiet and Chip raised a finger to his lips.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Very well, since nobody is here then there won't be any harm in me burning this place to the ground."

&#x200B;

"No, wait," I spoke up.

&#x200B;

"So you're all here after all."

&#x200B;

"Look, man, we're sorry. Right, guys?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glared at them and they agreed, then apologized to Baxter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"That doesn't change the terms. The Claude's had several decades to shut this place down."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Realizing we weren't going to get out of this unscathed, my heart sank.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"But I'm willing to make a deal. Send Claude out and the rest of you are free to go. I'll give you a couple minutes to decide."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With a mournful look, Spencer placed a hand on Chip's shoulder.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"We'll never forget you."

&#x200B;

"Fuck you guys," Chip yelled, smacking his hand away. "You're really going to send me out there?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Wanting to buy some time, I asked Baxter what he planned on doing to Chip. He went to excruciating detail involving skinning him alive and then sticking him in the fryer. Chip's face became paler and paler as we listened. Even though we sympathized with him, the fact of the matter was if we hesitated none of us would make it out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What's this?" we heard Baxter ask.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Metallic jingling indicated that he found the keys.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Shit, we forgot to grab them," Angelo said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The lock turned and the door swung open, revealing Baxter. We screamed, falling back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"And now you'll all pay," he replied. "Any last words?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Oddly, I did have some 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Why didn't you just go through the door?" I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Baxter stopped, then with a ghostly wail he made the containers around us levitate. Would this truly be how it would end, getting pelted to death by boxes of just expired meat? The front door's bell rang. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Hey, Chip," we heard his dad call out, "turns out I wasn't so lucky after all. Can you spot me a few hundred dollars? I kind of bet over my head."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He entered the kitchen and flew into a rage.

"What in the fuck did you morons do to this place?" he roared. "Is this what I pay you for?"

His rant ceased when he saw Baxter. Claude must've reminded him more of his former employer than Chip did because he decided to go for him instead. He didn't have a chance of getting away.

"Help me," Claude screamed as Baxter was dragging him away.

It was only upon hearing the fryer turn on did we break out of our paralysis and go after them. We got to them too late. Despite us cleaning the fryer earlier, it was now refilled and heated. The only thing we saw was Claude's burned hand sinking into it. The fryer then began rapidly vibrating and sparking. That was a clear sign to get the hell out of there and this time we didn't forget our keys.

Soon after we got out, the fryer exploded in the kitchen, resulting in a fire. The following week was hectic. The story we gave was that the fire was a freak accident and Chip's dad sadly perished in it. Seeing as how the building's wiring hadn't been upgraded since the 70s, that wasn't hard to believe. Chip made it onto the local news and was interviewed about the incident.

We wished him our condolences. Even though he thought his dad was an asshole, he did have a soft spot for the man. He told us thanks and said at least it meant Baxter won't ever return. Not to mention, insurance gave him a large payout which gave him the funds to attend college. As for us, we got jobs at a Waffle House that opened soon after Claude's fire.

There, we were able to save up and eventually moved away as well. Spencer and I talk on occasion and he's told me Angelo and Chip are doing good. The former works as an artist and the latter opened his own restaurant where his workers get treated fairly. Spencer works as an independent welding contractor and I took an interest in the paranormal and history so I decided to become a museum tourer.

In conclusion, if you have to work where a ghost will be on the anniversary of the night they swore to exact terrible vengeance, maybe utilize one of your sick days or you could end up burned like [Baxter](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) or [Claude.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)
