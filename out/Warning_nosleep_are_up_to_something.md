I'm posting on behalf of a friend, and this is his words:  
  
"It started kind of harmless.

I got hooked on reading "NoSleep." You know, it's engaging. At first it was just for fun. I'd read a few stories before bed, scare myself a little, then move on. But somehow, it started getting deeper. I'd spend hours at night reading, one story after the other, until the sun was almost rising. I was obsessively going through story after story, then I started to notice weird patterns.

It wasn’t just the stories that got to me. It was how real some of them felt. Like, not just good writing, something about them seemed… off. Too detailed. Too personal. Too believable.

I started obsessing over a couple stories in particular. One was about a girl who said OnlyFans ruined her life, that she got trapped in some "contract" and now she was being followed, blackmailed. Another was about an app that paid you money to do little tasks, but eventually told you to kill someone.

I couldn't let it go. I had to know if they were true.

I started digging. First, just scrolling through old posts, reading all the comments. Then searching their usernames everywhere online. I found one of them — the girl from the OnlyFans story. It wasn't hard, honestly. She used the same username on Instagram. I found her. She looked… normal. Regular posts, selfies, normal stuff. But every once in a while, she’d post something weird. A picture of a dark alley. A shot of a window cracked open at night with no caption.

I started checking her profile every day. Watching her stories. Tracking where she posted from.

Eventually, I figured out where she lived. It took time — piecing together little clues, backgrounds in her photos, tags from friends. I even traveled to her city. I drove by her apartment, just to see it with my own eyes. But that wasn’t enough.

I started following her. I watched her leave her building one morning, walk to a bus stop. I stayed behind, keeping my distance. She got on a bus heading toward the outskirts of the city. I followed in my car.

She ended up at this… place. I don’t even know how to describe it. It wasn’t like a regular office building or a store. It was isolated, surrounded by a chain-link fence with cameras on every corner. Big metal gates. Security guards. You needed a special keycard to even get close to the door.

What kind of job needs that much security?

Same thing with the guy who wrote about the murder app. It was harder with him because he lived in a different country. But I’m stubborn. I found him through some old forum posts linked to a real name. That led to a LinkedIn profile, and from there, some blurry photos from conferences he attended.

I saved up, told myself it was just a vacation, and flew out.

I saw him too. Same story. Normal apartment. Normal clothes. But every morning, he drove out to this facility in the middle of nowhere. Another fenced-off compound. High walls. Guard dogs. Checkpoints.

Whatever these places were, they weren't normal jobs. And they definitely weren't just "writers" making up scary stories online.

That's when I realized… maybe they weren't victims of some scary story.

Maybe they were part of it.

Maybe NoSleep isn't just for entertainment. Maybe it's a front. A testing ground. A place to leak bits of truth, twisted into "fiction," to see who notices.

And me? I noticed.

After that night, things got worse. Not just with me — with them.

The girl’s Instagram went dark. Deleted.

The guy’s Reddit account… gone. Wiped clean.

And then I got a text message. From a hidden number. What's weird is that the messaged popped up with an alert sound, like those alerts you get from tornadoes and kidnapped kids. with a weird string of numbers Inside the message. The message was :  
  
"Stop what you’re doing. You don’t understand what you're getting involved in."

I ignored it.

Two days later, I got another one, this type the alert kept buzzing and I couldn't turn off even though I tried to turn off my phone.  
  
"You’re getting close to something you shouldn’t. If you don't stop, we'll make sure you do."

I didn’t reply. I screenshotted everything. I thought about posting it, warning people, but something told me not to.

Then my Reddit account got banned. Not just from nosleep. from Reddit. I tried making another one. It got banned within minutes. But I still insisted on warning people so I asked a friend to post it.

That’s when it hit me: it’s not just stories. It’s not just a subreddit.

There’s something behind nosleep. Something real. Something that uses those "fake" stories to hide actual events. Like recruiting. Or covering things up.

And the moderators? They're not just mods.

They're part of it.

I'm writing this here because I don't know where else to put it. If you’re reading this, be careful. Don’t look too deep. Don’t dig. Don’t… search for them.

I did.

And now, I think they’re coming for me."
