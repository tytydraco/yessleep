I think it's safe to say that 2020 was a year most people would rather forget for reasons that I'm sure I don't even need to go into, and really the context of it all isn't that important to this story but what is important was the effect - the lockdowns, the mandatory isolation.

What could be better than being cooped up with your family and nowhere to escape except the maddening enclosure that was your room?

 I was 15 at the time and honestly I don't think I could have conjured up a worse scenario for me to be stuck in, I was at the age where I wanted to be out of the house and smoking weed with my pals and drinking whiskey in parks until the sun came up. 

My very own stereotypical high-school movie experience, I was in the middle of my turn at getting to have some silly, lived in fantasy's of party's and girls and everything else, and right where I felt as if I was approaching a golden era of my life the pandemic happened.

It was a weird time, it almost felt like a surreal day dream that everyone was in on, the sudden surge of user activity on the internet, the barren and desolate city centers, all mixed with the news constantly showing us the evolving horrors of it all. It felt apocalyptic.

With all that said, there was no global crisis that could even come close to contending with the trauma inflicted on me from what I'd come to learn and discover in my house during that year.

It all began when my sister Amy started showing signs of drug withdrawals.

The thing is, Amy has always been kind of reclusive in her personality, and that's not to say she's anti-social or rude, quite the opposite, but there is an air of method to her. 

Everything she says goes through what seems like a pretty intensive internal process before she commits, which can create some awkward silences and flows in conversation that can feel a touch too gradual, but she simply has to pick the 'right' thing to say. 

This attitude and internal make-up can be applied to most areas of her life, she doesn't do things on a whim or in the moment, she is the furthest possible distance away from being a spontaneous and free-spirited person

Amy is calculated. Everything in specific order. Ducks lined up with deliberation and pretense.

As I'm sure you can imagine, the isolation was basically torture for her.

At first that's what I thought it was, cabin fever; she was moody and snappy and erratic and tense and at times , she looked downright sickly. It was when the mental symptoms started to manifest Into physical responses, like fever and sweats and what not that I really started to notice and worry.  

My parents naturally *freaked the fuck out* at first; made her isolate in her room, forced swab tests on her, but she was clean.

No identifiable illness, no contagions, yet the symptoms persisted.

Another thing that's important to know about Amy is that she's *never* and I mean *never, ever* done illicit drugs, that was more my cup of brandy whereas hers was light roasted coffee if she felt especially dangerous.

 I wouldn't say she was straight as an arrow or anything, but the idea of her being addicted to something like Oxy or Xanax was so beyond out of character that it was teetering on being comical - so why did she look like she was?

Why was she so worn down and sick?

 It worried all of us, our parents especially, I mean she would barely even talk to us. 

Just sat in her room on her PC doing whatever it was she did, usually indulging one of her many hobby's like programming and something-something data- something-or-other, I don't know. She's smart, I'm not. 

I was worried about her.

Regardless of what I may have told you 5 years ago as a snotty 15 year old, I've always loved and looked up to Amy.

She is my older sister, granted, so there's a natural kinship there where I model some of the things I do based off her example even if I didn't quite realize it, but her lack of regard for how others saw her, what they thought of her, the way it had no impact on how she carried herself was pretty awe-inspiring to me growing up. She really just didn't give a fuck.

I, on the other hand, could barely contain myself and was grossly seeking approval from other people. 
Amy set what seemed like a healthy example of self-assuredness, confidence, and innate trust in who you are

Unfortunately, there was much more to it.

Amy wasn't well, and I didn't mean just since lockdown and all this happened, but I would come to learn that Amy was *really* not well. Mentally ill to a degree I to this day struggle to comprehend - In fact, to put it bluntly, she was, no, *is* \- completely fucking deranged.

Her lack of regard for how others saw her was rooted not in confidence but in apathy, something that I'd not have believed should you have told me as a young'un.

She was incredible at masking what festered beneath.

Like.... *incredible*, scary good.

The first night she snuck out I was flabbergasted, what the hell could be so important that she'd risk getting all of us sick? Potentially killing us? Sure, there wasn't many people lurking around the streets as *most* of them had that commonsense, but regardless, she was risking it. All of us. It was at this moment that I realized she must really be addicted to something. It was kind of mind blowing to think about.

Amy, fuckin' *Amy Scott* was revolting against the common authorities to score some mystery substance? Huh? Maybe she was seeing someone? No... No that wouldn't make sense. She has never seeked boyfriends or just male approval in general, let alone taking a risk like that for a guy... which leaves me still wondering why...

Why would she be out there?

If she really was going out to score drugs, I made a solemn but sincere promise to myself that I'd kill the fucker who supplied her.

Hindsight can be awful.

Being the kind of kid I was back then, you know - snoopy,  had no concept of boundaries, overly worrying, generally annoying- when I noticed she snuck out I made sure that I'd use the time efficiently.

I wasn't sure how long she was going to be gone for, could be as many minutes or as few hours as I was willing to imagine, the only blueprint I had was knowing that she wouldn't want to come back anywhere near the time that mum and dad would be awake.

Regardless of my assumptions I'd settled on 5 minutes, 10 minutes maximum.

All I wanted to do was get a sense of what I, nay, what *we* were dealing with.

We're family, after all, and while you definitely shouldn't invade the privacy of your siblings and break their trust by going into their nest and shoving your nose where it doesn't belong, my justification for it was that she needed help but wasn't sure how to ask for it.

Well, fear not, Ames, your brother is here to valiantly save the day.

The white knight you never asked for and certainly never wanted.

When I entered her room, I was immediately met with the first fragment of darkness she'd been keeping.

It seared its way into my developing brain, sizzling and nestling into a demented core memory, burned into my dreams like a branding iron.

Her PC was paused on a video, a video that at initial glance was more camera fuzz and blurred crimson than any perceivable image, but when I moved the cursor and highlighted the title I had to do a triple take to make sure I was reading it right,

"2 men 1 chainsaw"

When I clicked play, what I saw made my stomach turn.

It was snuff.

An unmistakably real snuff video of what looked to be members of the Mexican cartel butchering two men who were chained to a wall in a dingy, damp looking basement.

The wall behind them was stained in various shades of red, pink and yellow.

Usually when people encounter this kind of content, *usually* its by their own accord, sure it will still shock them, traumatize them, maybe they'll lose their lunch, but they still make that choice.   
They lead themselves there by the leash of morbid curiosity.

I didn't.

I stumbled on it.

Stumbled on two men being not just murdered, but *tortured.*

The perpetrators were belly laughing so loud it almost overshadowed the dampening revs and whirs as they surgically flayed and dismembered their victims, you could tell they were trying to keep their victims alive as long as possible, keep them screaming and crying.

I almost threw up on the screen, but before I lost control, I recomposed my self and shakily paused the video.

When I paused, that's when I saw the other tabs.

Dozens, all with similar titles.

"1 bitch, 1 dog", "1 man 1 icepick", and other titles I would really rather not repeat, to maintain whatever innocence I have left.

*what.*

*the.*

*fuck?!*

Surely, she is just engaging in some morbid curiosity, right? Right? Maybe she is studying it. Maybe she is interested in the anatomy of it.

Surely, she can't enjoy this. She wouldn't enjoy something like this, would she? How could she? This was the most vile thing I'd ever laid eyes on.

Why did she have so many tabs open?

There were literally dozens and dozens of them, and they seemed to get worse the further down the line you went.

Demented, disgusting ducklings in this digital and perfect descenting line of depravity, all serving some fucked up viewing experience Amy had curated.

My mind was a whirl-wind, my stomach a sink-hole, I must have been standing there for... god, I don't even know, my fight or flight response malfunctioned and I was frozen in place.

My mind everywhere and nowhere all at once, my first ever bout of disassociation.

Probably my first serious traumatic event, like, there was \*no way\* I would ever un-see or un-learn any of this.

It was right as I began to properly process what I'd seen, and going over just a morsel of the possibilities of what this could possibly mean for Amy, that the bedroom window opened and she started crawling through.

Her eyes widened as she stealthily planted herself on the ground.

The eye contact was burning a hole through my skull.

She sported a black hoodie that was snugly draped over her head, her bangs messy and frizzled.

Her facemask was ripe with sweat, the material pulling in and pushing out as her breath tried to catch up to her, tiny flickers of moisture managing to escape.

She was trembling. Shaking. Like she had absorbed too much energy and her body was rejecting it to maintain balance.

But something was different.

She wasn't fatigued, or sickly, or distant, she was.... lively.

In fact, she looked elated.

As elated as anyone could be who's brother just busted them for their fucked up viewing habits, but elated nonetheless.

Shockingly peaceful all things considered.

"Uh, yeah. Hey... Amy, uh. Look" I say to her, sheepish and shaky,

She shushed me with a whisper so faint it barely registered, her finger raising to her mouth being the main communicator.

She removed her mask, revealing a stern and stoic expression of total vacancy.

The silence was thick.

I waited for her inner-process to finish and deliver me some one-liner of snarky wisdom as she so often would.

But she didn't.

She just looked at me, a deer in headlights, an expression of resentful elation that mixed and melted with impatience the more the silence lingered.

"I'll... I didn't... I won't say anything. Let's just forge-"

She cut me off with a tone of voice that was drenched in menace and authority

***"Never, ever  acknowledge what you saw in here. Not to me. Not to Mum. Not to Dad. Never. Never. Don't make me repeat it. Don't ever fucking make me repeat what I just said***.  ***Now, get the fuck out of my room. Right fucking now, Isaac."***

The cold and malicious delivery of her words was more frightening than anything else that happened that night.

I hurried out of her room as silently as possible as to not stir the hive and invite more stress into this situation, the last thing I'd need right now is to answer mum's daily 20 questions - I made my way into my bedroom and gently closed the door, leaning against it and realizing what had just happened.

Who was that? Who is she? Do I know my own sister? Because the way she spoke, looked, held herself.... that wasn't the Amy I grew up with. Like an imposter wearing Amy's skin. I couldn't believe how scared she'd made me feel. *Amy*, scaring me?

It was so much to process, and then like a light switch or a terrible miracle, something registered.

Something I saw when she came in as I analysed her head to toe looking for any signs of what was going on,

Her hair. Her frizzled bangs that hung just above her eyes.

They were decorated with tiny drops of blood.
