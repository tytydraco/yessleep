I am a detective inspector in London and the cases transferred to me are, in a way, usually the subject of the paranormal. Earlier, I shared my first paranormal case with you. This time I am going to tell you about an ongoing murder investigation, which is, to be honest, freaking me out.

My phone buzzed and I saw the name of my boss on the screen. 'Watts? Get to the Hotel Lion right away, I've got a case for you,' he said.

(For reasons, I am using a different, imaginary name, the Hotel Lion does not exist in London)

I was still groggy, it being 5:30 in the morning, earlier than when I'd normally wake up.

I wondered what my boss was doing that early, especially at a hotel and I had a feeling that something was off; Nevertheless, I proceeded to get ready so that I could join him.

By the time I arrived at the spot, the sun was already up. The Hotel Lion glimmered in the morning sun, its tall windows reflecting off the cobblestone streets of central London. Sleek and modern, it stood out among the other grey brick buildings, its shimmering facade a testament to human ambition.

I parked my car at the parking lot, walked into the building and I showed my badge to the receptionist who told me that m colleagues were waiting for me on the third floor.

My footsteps echoed down the third floor hallway. As I rounded the corner, I noticed that a group of police officers had clustered around the end of the hallway, murmuring among themselves. My supervisor, DCI Brown, spotted me from the crowd and beckoned me over. His face was pinched with worry.

'Come and take a look inside this room, I'm not sure what we're dealing with,' he said.

My stomach dropped. 'What do you mean? What room?' I asked.

Brown gestured towards the open door to go inside. With a heavy sigh, I followed his instructions and turned my gaze to the door, feeling a sudden chill race down my spine. 'What am I looking for?' I asked, although I knew the answer before he said it.

The first thing that caught my eye was a dead body on the floor. The body had no marks or evidence of struggle around him. The only clue to this mystery was that he had carefully folded up his clothing in one neat pile beside him - as if for some ritual purpose before taking off into the afterlife. His face showed signs of extreme shock as if something inhuman had suddenly possessed itself upon him just moments before passing away from this life forever.

The air was thick with tension as I carefully surveyed my surroundings -- a single desk lamp illuminated in its corner, vintage furniture aligned against three of the walls, ruffled velvet curtains pulled close to protect from any outsiders viewing inwards... but most notably of all were two mugs with half drunk tea placed on either side of an armchair.

'He registered under a fake ID. Larry Smith and the address he gave doesn't exist, the guys have already checked it.' - Brown added.

'I see. So someone was here beside him? Could he have been murdered?' I asked the CSI investigators, my voice raising in confusion.

'Yes and no,' a voice replied from behind me and I stumbled back in surprise. Our medical examiner Susan stepped out of the private bathroom, her eyes wide and her posture tense.

'What do you mean?' I asked.

Susan crouched down to the body.

'Discoloration around the lips, ears and nails. These are the signs of cyanosis - the skin turned blue due to a lack of oxygen. Oh, honey, you must have suffered quite a bit,' she said and adjusted the hair of the dead body.

'So he was strangled?'

'No, because there are no marks or bruises around his neck.'

'Pillows?' My gaze diverted to the bed and I caught sight of a few pillows

'Possibly. But we need to take samples from those pillows to make sure.'

I knew why Susan said that. The bed was immaculate as if nobody had ever slept on it.

'So what the hell was going on here?

'Ask him,' Susan said and I turned around to find a young man in a navy blue uniform standing at the door. The gold buttons that adorned his blazer glinted in the light and he wore a peaked cap with the hotel's emblem stitched onto it.

'I am Richard and I am the one who escorted Mr Morgan to his room,' he said.

'So he was alone?'

'Definitely. Nobody else checked in with him,' he replied.

'Did he have a guest?' I asked.

'That's the weird part. I went to deliver the room service order and opened the door, only to discover absolute darkness. He was seated on the couch in the dimness and commanded me tiredly to set down the tray on the desk. Yet I could swear I heard someone in the restroom. After that, I left in a jiffy.'

'Are you sure he wasn't alone?' I asked.

'Absolutely. There was somebody in the bathroom taking a shower and he was humming a song.'

'He?'

'The voice was more like a male than female.'

'How about the CCTV?' I asked, my interest etched into my face.

He rubbed his chin in thought and nodded. 'Yes, we have cameras on every floor.'

I need every single one of these if I’m going to be able to analyze them properly,” I said, my voice heavy with authority.

I had almost finished up my work in the hotel room, but as I rounded the bed, I caught sight of my reflection in the mirror. A chill ran down my spine as I noticed a figure standing behind me.

He had on an olive green raincoat, and his face was hidden in shadows. All I could make out were his eyes – they were a bright, piercing blue that seemed to penetrate right through me with an intensity that made my heart skip a beat. He seemed to be staring at something, but what?

I jumped back in surprise and fear.

'You all right, sweetheart?' Susan asked me.

I realized that nobody else could see it besides me, which terrified me even more.

I had no idea what it was in the mirror but the hairs on my arms stood on end, my skin prickling with the feeling that the thing in the mirror as I realized that the thing might have been coming for me.

I had never seen anything like it before, and I felt a chill run through my body as if someone had walked over my grave. Was this some kind of spirit or demon? Or maybe an illusion created by the hotel's haunted history? I didn't know what to think, but all I wanted at that moment was to get out of there as soon as possible.

I rushed out of the hotel and quickly got into my car. As I turned on the ignition, I glanced back at the mirror. To my horror, I could see the same figure still in the back seat, but he remained silent, not saying a word. I felt a wave of panic wash over me and I turned the mirror away, so I did could not see him anymore.

My hands were shaking as I drove back to the police station, my mind abuzz with questions and fears. Who or what had I seen in that hotel room? What did it want from me? Was there a connection between it and the missing man? Why had nobody else noticed this figure in the mirror except for me?

I made a mental note to investigate further into this strange occurrence. For now, I would have to study the CCTV footage and hope to find some answers.

I inserted the USB stick into my laptop and started playing the video. On the screen, I could see Rick, the bellboy, and a man in a suit walk into the room. Then Rick left the room and closed the door behind him. An hour later I saw Rick deliver an order to the room, but there was only one dish—despite two people being inside, as he had mentioned. I was confused. Why did he only order one meal if there were two people in there?

Afterwards, I noticed that no one else ever entered the room. I saw people walking around the hallways, but they never went inside. No one exited the room until the morning when cleaners found Rick's body.

I also took the records of the camera at the reception desk. He was a tall figure with a cut on his cheek, and his movements were jerky and anxious like he was trying to hide something. He kept looking over his shoulder as he spoke with the clerk as if someone was coming after him. Other than that, there was nothing else.

I needed to know more about this man but before I started doing my research, I went to the restroom to take a pee. Afterwards, I went to the sink to cleanse my hands. That's when I saw his frame again. His hood was pulled down low, creating a deep darkness that seemed to cover his face. Then there were his two pools of azure blue eyes—so piercing that it seemed he was looking straight through me.

A chill ran up my spine, and my hand instinctively reached for the penknife I kept in my pocket. In a panic, I flung it wildly at the mirror behind me, shattering it into a thousand pieces.

I was standing in the restroom, still frozen in shock from what I had witnessed. I jumped at the sound of DCI Brown's voice behind me. He stood in the doorway, one hand on the doorknob, surprise and confusion on his face.

"Watts! What in the world is going on here?”

I stuttered out an explanation. “I-I...just...can’t get over what I saw today, boss.”

His expression softened and he said in a gentle but firm tone, “You look like shit! You will use some time off when this case is solved. You need it because otherwise, you will go crazy!"

I could not agree with him more.

It was then that I realized how truly strange the events of the day were. That figure in the mirror—I could not shake him from my mind. Was he real? A figment of my imagination? I shuddered at the thought and decided to get back to work.

There was a moment that day when I went to the kitchen and I could see his reflection staring back at me again even on the door of the microwave.

His hood pulled low and his blue eyes pierced through mine like daggers into my soul. It sent a chill up my spine and left me feeling more unnerved than ever before.

I needed to take a walk.

My pulse raced as I stumbled out of the station, my gaze darting from window to window. Everywhere I looked, the mysterious figure was staring back. His reflection winked at me from on top of a parked car, then a storefront window, then a glass skyscraper. I felt like a rabbit being chased by an invisible predator, and my steps quickened with every reflection I saw.

I made a beeline for the pub down the street. I was in desperate need of something to take my mind off this case and the strange figure that seemed to haunt me. I ordered my favourite drink—Jim Beam—in a plastic cup of course, which weirded the waiter out a bit. Then I sat down at an empty table in the corner of the room.

It was early in the morning and the pub was surprisingly lively, but not too crowded as many patrons were on their way to work. The atmosphere was calm and soothing, with the sound of soft music playing in the background and the gentle murmur of laughter and conversation filling the air. I sipped slowly on my drink, letting its warmth seep through my veins as I watched all around me.

Just as I was about to take my last sip, my phone started ringing. I glanced at the caller ID and saw it was DCI Brown.

'Watts! Where are you?' His voice sounded urgent over the line.

'I'm at the pub down the street from the station,' I said hesitantly.

He sighed audibly before saying, “I need you here now. There have been some new developments in this case that we need to discuss urgently. The victim's real name is Kenneth Brackin and he lives on Canvey Island. His fingerprint was already in our database. He was arrested earlier for a minor crime. You might want to look around at his address.”

My heart sank as I realized this was not going to end anytime soon. With a heavy sigh, I finished my drink and headed back towards the station resolved to solve this case—whatever it may be—once and for all.

I'm in my office now, waiting for the search warrant. I have a foreboding feeling that the truth lies in his home, and my gut tells me it may not be pleasant. Something deeply sinister is waiting for me, I can sense it.
