Cold air hums through the night sky. The moonlight illuminates the grassy meadows. A sense of dread lingers in the air.

In the distance, by the woodline, glowing yellow eyes stalk my movements. The hairs on my back perk up. My survival instincts tell me I am not safe. I hurried into my house. Everything seems normal. I lock up and head to bed.

After a couple of hours of sleep, I am woken by the sound of knocking. It’s coming from the window. I feel confused and a little dazed. My room is on the second floor, so I assume my mind is playing tricks on me. I creep up and swing the blinds open. Nothing. I sigh in relief.

I examine the surrounding area through the window. Then—right fucking below me in the bushes—glowing eyes stare right back at me.

I shut the blinds and grab my twelve-gauge from under the bed. As I head downstairs, my body suddenly goes into shock. It is waiting for me. The stench of rot invades my nostrils. I take a deep breath and swallow my fear. I am about to head outside when, in an instant, knocking erupts from everywhere. My house is surrounded by noise.

I run upstairs and lock myself in my room. Talking to myself, I try to rationalize what the hell is happening. I decide to look out the window again, hoping to see something—anything—that makes sense.

I slowly move the blinds aside.

Then—I am face to face with an utterly disgusting being straight from hell.

Its skin is ghost-white, completely hairless. Its black, sharpened teeth glisten, smeared with oozing remains. Its yellow eyes lock onto mine.

I scream and run to the bathroom, locking the door. I stay there until dawn.

In the morning, I check around my house. Nothing stands out. I try to go about my day, pushing the image of that thing out of my head. But I can’t stop thinking about it.

I start Googling, searching for anything remotely similar to what I saw last night. I came across a demon-hunting website. It claims that surrounding a house with holy water will keep evil spirits away. Without hesitation, I head into town to pick some up from a local church. Surprisingly, no one asks any questions.

On the drive home, I get the eerie sensation of being watched. I try to shake it off and get to work.

Nightfall comes again.

Lying in bed, I can’t stop wondering what that thing wanted last night. I can’t come to any conclusions. The thought gets under my skin—I keep checking the window every few minutes. I can’t sleep.

Finally, I tell myself to stop. One last look, then I’ll get some rest.

I glance out the window.

The glowing eyes are back.

They are far away, near the woodline. I assume the holy water is actually working. But then—it steps out from the trees.

I see its full body now.

It stands at an average human height, but its skin is pale as a corpse. No fur. Long claws swing at its sides.

It approaches the line of holy water. Then—an ear-piercing screech erupts from the being.

In a flash, it sprints to my front door.

The holy water only pissed it off.

A massive crash shakes the house. It’s inside.

My bedroom door starts shaking violently. It’s trying to get in. I throw my weight against the door, bracing it with everything I have. Then—a long, scarred, pale arm explodes through the wood, clawing wildly.

Its razor-sharp claws tear into my back.

Pain—excruciating pain.

I collapse onto the floor, piss soaking my pants.

The door finally gives way.

It slowly walks toward me and stands above my trembling body. Then, it squats down, tilting its head, examining me inch by inch.

It lifts my head, dragging its claw across my cheek, splitting it open.

Its long, black tongue slithers out, licking the blood from my face.

I am frozen. My mind is in a trance, unable to comprehend.

Then, it suddenly lets out a deafening roar and bolts out of the room.

I passed out.

Now, I’ve just woken up. My wounds are completely black.

It is almost nightfall.

The screeches are everywhere, echoing through the woods.

I remember a folklore my grandpa once told me. A creature called The Rake.

I believe that’s what’s toying with me.

Whatever you do, please—don’t go into the woods in Georgia.

You might end up meeting The Rake.
