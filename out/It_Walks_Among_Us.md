Part 1: Starry Skies



I’ve kept this secret to myself for a long time, afraid of what would happen if I ever spoke it aloud. But I can’t keep it in anymore. It’s become too much to bear. Even if revealing it means facing consequences, I’d rather endure whatever comes than continue living with this haunting every day. I’m writing to this community, hoping that maybe someone out there will understand what I’m going through. I can’t be the only one who’s had to endure something like this. Right now, I’m locked in my room, trying to put all of this down in words, something that’s been eating away at me for what feels like forever. I need to get it out. If anyone has gone through anything like this, maybe I won’t feel so isolated, so lost. I don’t know how much longer I can carry this weight without letting it out.

I’m a single dad. My wife, Maria, passed away from cancer, and nothing in this world can truly prepare a man to lose the love of his life. There is no preparation for watching your child say goodbye to the woman who meant everything to both of you. For a long time, it felt like the world had come to a complete stop. Every day felt like an eternity. But I had to keep going, for Adam—our son. He needed me. We live in Julian, California—remote, rural, and peaceful, far from the noise and chaos of city life. I made the decision to move us here, hoping it would give us some space, some quiet time to heal. And while the silence was welcome, it was never truly quiet with a 6-year-old. After I dropped Adam off at school, the house would feel empty, and I’d have time to reflect, to think about Maria, to wish she were still here. I’d think about her, our life together, and how the memories of our son’s crazy imagination filled the house with so much life. His endless adventures, his tales of galaxies far away, the way his mind would wander and create stories so big that I could never keep up. It was as if his creativity was inherited straight from Maria. He had my looks, my eyes, but his heart and mind—they were all hers. Sometimes, it felt like a piece of her still lived on in him.

Every night, we’d sit together, watch a space-themed movie, and then step outside to gaze at the stars. Adam always had this special connection to the sky—he’d point out constellations, tell me facts he learned in school, and go on about the planets, about how one day he’d like to travel there. I’d carry him to bed afterward, his little hands clutching my shirt as I tucked him in. It was routine. It was comforting. But it wasn’t always enough to fill the space that Maria left behind. That was, until one night, when everything changed.

It began like any other evening. Adam and I were outside, lying on the cool concrete, our gazes fixed on the stars above us. He rambled on, as he always did, about space, the stars, his thoughts spinning out faster than I could keep track of. But then, something shifted. For a few moments, Adam fell completely silent, his eyes wide, unblinking, as he stared at the sky with an intensity that I had never seen before. It was as if he was no longer in the moment, his mind somewhere far beyond, lost in thought. I called out to him, and slowly, he snapped back to reality. He lifted his arm and pointed up at the sky, his lips curling into a faint, almost knowing grin.

“Daddy… the stars are dancing tonight.”

His voice was soft, almost as if he was talking to himself, not to me. I turned my head toward the sky, expecting to see a plane, maybe a flashing light, something to explain his words. But there was nothing. Just the same peaceful sky, the same stars, all of them stationary and calm. I figured it was just his imagination at work, as it so often was, and decided it was time to bring him inside. He didn’t seem to notice, his eyes still fixed on the window, watching as if he was waiting for something.

After a bit of TV to wind down, I stepped outside on my own, needing a moment of solitude. I stared up at the sky, letting my mind drift, remembering Maria, wishing she was still here with me, with us. I lost track of time, my thoughts consumed by her, by the memories we had made together. And then, something happened. One of the stars—one that had been perfectly still the entire time—suddenly darted in a direction that made no sense. It wasn’t a shooting star. I knew that much. My mind tried to rationalize it, to explain it away. Maybe it was my eyes playing tricks on me, maybe the dark sky had fooled me into thinking I saw something. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right. That star had been motionless, perfectly stationary, and now it had moved. And the unease settled deep in my chest, something in my gut telling me that things weren’t as simple as they seemed.

  


Part 2: Dreams



It’s important for anyone reading this to understand that this moment marked the real turning point for me. As an adult, it's easy to dismiss the strange things a kid might say—especially when that kid has an overactive imagination. I regret that now. Looking back, I see how foolish I was for not taking it more seriously, for allowing myself to think it was just one of Adam’s creative flights of fancy. But things started to build after that night—the night Adam called “the night the stars danced.” At first, everything seemed normal. Life continued on as usual, and the stargazing rituals didn’t change. Adam didn’t mention anything strange about the stars again, and I figured it was just another one of those moments where he let his imagination run wild.

As the school year wound down, I began putting Adam to bed a little earlier. He wasn’t thrilled about it, of course, but the melatonin seemed to help. One minute, he’d be complaining about how unfair it was, and the next, he'd be fast asleep, as though the exhaustion of the day had hit him all at once. It made our nights shorter, but I still made sure to spend as much time as possible with him during the day. We had our adventures—most of which involved Adam taking off to distant planets in his mind, while I was left behind. He always promised me it wasn’t anything personal, but it didn’t stop me from feeling a pang of loneliness when he talked about his journeys.

Life, however, went on, until one night when everything seemed to shift. I had just finished closing the blinds for the night, preparing to settle in for bed, when I heard the familiar patter of bare feet against the hardwood floor. I turned around, expecting to see Adam just coming out of his room, but what I saw sent a wave of dread through me. Adam was standing at the bottom of the stairs, his eyes glazed over, his body unnaturally stiff. He wasn’t awake—not fully, anyway. He was sleepwalking. And I had never seen him do that before. Maybe his sleep schedule or the melatonin had something to do with it, but there was something unsettling about the way he moved.

I approached him cautiously, thinking I’d gently guide him back to bed. But before I could touch him, his arm shot up, his finger pointing straight ahead at the door. His posture was rigid, like he was frozen in place, like he wasn’t aware of his surroundings at all. The sight of his unmoving finger, pointing so deliberately, sent a chill through me. I followed his gaze to the glass door, but there was nothing—just the usual quiet darkness outside. The house was still, and everything appeared normal. But the feeling that something wasn’t right lingered in the air, thick and suffocating.

I walked to the door, opened it, and stepped outside, trying to shake the unease that clung to me. The night air was cool, and the distant howls of coyotes echoed from the mountains, but there was nothing out of the ordinary. I stepped further into the yard, trying to dismiss the growing sense of dread. Then, something caught my eye—something I couldn’t ignore. Just beyond the concrete, a patch of dirt seemed out of place. It was compacted, forming an odd, deliberate shape. It looked like four shoes had been arranged in pairs, with the dirt raised slightly around them. It was too neat, too purposeful to be the work of an animal. My mind tried to rationalize it—maybe it was an animal, maybe something else. But deep down, I couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t random.

A sense of unease gnawed at me, growing stronger the more I tried to push it away. The house was isolated—so far from our nearest neighbor—and the idea of someone being out here didn’t make sense. The prints were too big to belong to a person. While a bear could have left a mark, the shape still didn’t sit right with me. It felt like someone—or something—had been standing there, waiting. Watching.

The next morning, I asked Adam if he remembered sleepwalking. He looked at me with confusion, just as puzzled as I was. "Sorry, buddy," I said, ruffling his hair. "I didn’t mean to confuse you. I’ve just never seen you do that before." I tried to lighten the mood. "How’d you sleep?"

"Good," he replied, grabbing his bookbag and heading toward the door. "I had a dream I was in space and made friends with an alien."

My heart skipped a beat, but I kept my voice steady. "Oh really? What did you and the alien do?"

"We traveled the universe, and they showed me cool things. I even got to be one in the dream! I came back to say hey and was pointing at you from outside, Daddy!"

My blood ran cold. I tried to mask my shock, but inside, everything froze. How could he know about the pointing? I had never told him about it. I hadn’t mentioned the strange sleepwalking, the way he’d been pointing at the door with that strange, unblinking gaze. How could he have known?

I drove him to school that morning, my mind racing. Part of me was terrified to be alone in the house, but I knew I couldn’t let it control me. He was just a six-year-old boy, and I told myself it was probably just another one of his wild stories, his way of impressing me or pulling a little prank. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something deeper, something that couldn’t be explained. What unsettled me the most, though, was that Adam had known. He knew. And that terrified me.

  


Part 3: Sleep Walking



I apologize for the shortness of the last couple of parts; my memory isn’t great, and honestly, these memories are hard to recall. I understand it’s important to express these experiences fully—not just to help you understand what we went through but also so I can leave them behind. I’m sorry if the next parts are longer, but I can’t keep leaving out details that will only haunt me if I don’t share them.

I could’ve told Adam about what happened when he sleepwalked, but I didn’t want to scare him. He probably would’ve thought it was cool, but I didn’t want him to sense that I was worried or freaked out. I went on with my days, and over time, the fear morphed into the idea that it was all just a weird coincidence. I kept giving Adam his melatonin before bed, hoping it was the source. That night, I checked in on him before sleep. He was curled up in his bed, snoring away, and I closed the door with a sigh of relief. I figured the previous night was an anomaly, nothing more.

Later, as I settled into bed, I felt my body and mind begin to relax. That’s when I heard it: a faint tapping sound. I opened my eyes and sat up, assuming it was Adam knocking at my door. With a sigh, I got out of bed and shuffled over to open it. To my surprise, Adam wasn’t there. I stood for a few seconds, confused, before the tapping came again. This time, I noticed it seemed to echo through the house, faint but rhythmic. Tap…tap, tap, tap…tap…tap, tap, tap. The noise was precise, almost coordinated.

I walked over to Adam’s room, opened the door, and scanned the dark room. He was still nestled under his blanket, sleeping soundly. I checked the other rooms upstairs—no sign of anything unusual. The tapping paused briefly, then resumed, almost like it was on a timer. Both our rooms were upstairs, and there weren’t any trees nearby, so I ruled out a branch tapping on the window. I made my way downstairs, and the sound grew slightly louder. It had to be some animal or something else outside—maybe the wind pushing a bush against the window, or even a bird pecking.

We always left some lights on, so my eyes adjusted quickly as I walked through the darkened house. When I got to the kitchen, the tapping stopped again. I flicked on the light, but everything in the room looked normal—nothing unusual at all. I checked the fridge, the dishwasher, and the rest of the kitchen. Nothing. As I stood by the counter, I started scanning the shadows that played on the walls. It’s strange how shadows shift when the light outside flickers, but then I saw something. One shadow—an elongated hand—slowly began to rise, stretching upward. My breath caught in my throat, and I froze, too terrified to move. The hand grew larger, as if it was approaching the window, and just as it reached its peak, I heard the tapping again.

Tap…tap, tap, tap…tap.

My heart raced as I turned to the window. I saw nothing. I rushed to it, looking out into the empty night, but all I saw was dust swirling in the breeze. My mind was racing, trying to find an explanation, when I noticed something in the dirt just in front of the house. The same compacted patch from the last time. The shape was identical, about the size of four shoes, arranged in two pairs. My stomach churned as the questions flooded back, but they were cut short when I heard something behind me.

I turned quickly, grabbing the nearest knife and facing the sound. To my shock, it was Adam, sleepwalking again. I set the knife down, frustrated and confused. As I picked him up, I watched in disbelief as he moved toward the same spot I had just been standing. He climbed onto the counter and stood, facing the window. The tapping started again. Tap…tap, tap, tap...tap.

I rushed over and grabbed him off the counter. "Adam! What the hell are you doing? Do you think this is funny?" I shouted, anger boiling up inside me. But Adam just looked around, confused. “Daddy, what are you talking about? Why did you bring me in here?” he asked.

I snapped. “Stop with the crap! I don’t know why you’re doing this, but enough is enough!”

As soon as I yelled, his lip quivered, and his eyes filled with tears. He started crying, and it hit me. I had crossed a line. I looked down at his arm and saw a dark red mark where I had been holding him too tightly. Guilt washed over me. I hadn’t meant to hurt him, but I had, out of fear. I pulled him into a hug and apologized, but it took a while for his sobs to calm down.

Once he stopped crying, I carried him back to my room, making sure his arm was fine. I had almost lashed out at him for something that wasn’t his fault. The next morning, I asked him about the sleepwalking, but of course, he didn’t remember anything. I didn’t bring up the tapping or the shadow. I didn’t want to upset him. We spent the day watching movies to make up for the night, but all I could think about was what had happened.

That night, I knew I wouldn’t sleep. The image of the hand on the wall haunted me, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone had been out there, playing some twisted game. I thought about installing cameras, motion detectors—anything to make sure Adam was safe. I was determined to find out what was happening, but that night, as I drifted off to sleep on the couch, the sound of the movies acted as a lullaby. I wasn’t sure what it was, but I was going to make sure that Adam was safe, no matter what.

As sleep finally took over, the last thing I saw in my mind was the image of E.T., reaching out with his glowing finger, touching the boy’s finger. Little did I know, that image would forever haunt me.

  


Part 4: Voices



After installing the cameras and motion detectors around the house, I made sure to set up everything I needed on my phone to alert me. I was determined to catch whoever the hell had decided to come to my house. Adam's life had already been impacted by Maria’s death; I didn’t need another thing to affect him. I just had to hope that whoever had been there hadn’t been watching me put up the devices during the day.

After spending the day with Adam, the orange hue of the sunset began to overtake the house, and the shadows stretched long across the walls. I still felt guilty about Adam’s bruised arm from the night before, so I let him sleep with me that night, hoping it would help him forgive me and so he wouldn’t be alone. I figured that if he did sleepwalk again, at least I’d be able to see everything and maybe figure out what was going on with him.

Even though it took longer for him to fall asleep, I didn’t give him the medicine. It seemed to be a common factor in his recent behavior. After about 30 minutes of tossing and turning, he finally laid still, and I continued to stare at the phone screen.

From what I could remember from the night before, the sounds had started around 2 AM, so I made sure to stay up until 3. I was a light sleeper, so even if I nodded off, the alert on my phone would spring me awake in a heartbeat.

I waited, reading the book I’d been meaning to finish for what felt like a year. I checked the time after what felt like an eternity of pages. It was 2:30 AM. Still nothing. Adam hadn’t moved an inch since he’d fallen asleep, and my phone stayed silent. Maybe whoever it was had seen me set everything up and decided to back off. Or maybe, just maybe, they were waiting for the perfect time.

I waited another 30 minutes. Still, everything was quiet. It seemed like a normal night. I placed my phone beside me in case of any alerts, rested my head on the pillow, and before I knew it, I was passed out. The darkness of sleep enveloped me.

I didn’t know how long I was asleep, but it felt like mere minutes when I was suddenly jolted awake. My eyes flew open. The clock read 4 AM. I looked down to see the blanket had been moved. I turned over to face Adam—and gasped.

There he was, standing on the bed, his eyes closed but facing the door. He was standing straight up, as if he had been placed there. His arms were firm by his sides, and his body was rigid—like a soldier at attention.

I froze, staring at him for a few seconds. I checked the door—still closed—and continued to watch in stunned silence. Minutes passed, and he stayed in the same position. Finally, he stepped off the bed.

I slowly sat up, careful not to disturb him. Adam stumbled, his movements unsteady as if he was just learning to walk. He made his way toward the door, and I quietly followed.

He stopped at the door, just standing there. I wanted to wake him up, but something held me back. I had to see what he was going to do next. Silence stretched in the room, lasting what felt like ten minutes before I began to hear faint whispering.

I crept closer to him, straining to understand what he was saying, but the words were unclear. His lips moved so fast it was hard to keep up.

When I was just a foot away from him, I froze. His eyes—wide open—stared at the door ahead, never blinking. His mouth moved faster and faster, as if he were talking to someone on the other side.

Then I heard it. Another voice. Identical to his, but slightly louder. My heart hammered in my chest. It was coming from the other side of the door.

I pressed my ear against the door, straining to hear, but the voice was still too quiet. There was no alert on my phone—no movement in the house. Yet someone, or something, was on the other side. My mind raced. The only other way into the house was the chimney. No human could have gotten up there without a ladder, and I would have seen them on the camera.

That terrible thought—someone was speaking to my son—gnawed at me. Slowly, I lowered myself to the floor to peer under the door, trying to get a glimpse of the intruders.

I could barely make anything out through the crack. Two objects blocked the light. They were too large to be human, but they seemed to match the shapes of the imprints in the dirt from the previous night.

Before I could process what I was seeing, the whispering stopped. The room went completely silent.

Adam raised his hand and placed it on the door, his fingers tapping softly. The same tapping I’d heard the night before, but this time it was slower.

I stared, horrified, when a second tap echoed in the hallway. The sound was almost... vibrating in my ear. I knew it had come from the floor—the same floor I was lying on.

I dared not look. I knew whatever or whoever it was on the other side had seen me, and I was being watched.

I slowly moved my eyes back to the floor, and there, staring at me from the crack, was an eye. A deep, dark eye. Its pupil was not round but formed into a disfigured triangle, unlike anything I had ever seen before.

I was paralyzed with fear. My gaze locked with the eye, unable to look away. Then, another tap came from the other side, vibrating through the floor beneath me.

Tap…tap, tap, tap…tap.

In a flash, the eye disappeared, and heavy, fleshy footsteps echoed down the hallway. I shot up, grabbing Adam and pushing him out of harm’s way, then slammed the door open to chase after whatever it was.

Down the stairs, I saw the dents in the walls where it had made its escape. I raced to the fireplace, only to find the ash scattering, a sign of its departure.

Panic gripped my chest. I rushed back into the room, only to be met with a sight that froze me in place. Adam stood at the doorway, his body trembling with an unnatural force. His mouth was stretched wide, and his hands gripped the edges of his lips with such intensity that I could see the skin pulling and tearing. His fingers dug deep, his nails almost digging into his own flesh as he tried to force something out, something I couldn’t even begin to understand. His eyes were rolled back, revealing nothing but the stark white of his sclera, veins running like twisted rivers across his eyes. The sound that escaped him—it was inhuman. A guttural screech from the depths of hell, so raw and terrible it seemed to shake the very foundation of the house.

In a moment of terror, I rushed forward, grabbing his arms with all my strength to stop the horrid torment he was inflicting on himself. He was relentless, though, his screams turning into desperate sobs, his hands still pulling at his mouth as if trying to escape some unseen force. His body jerked in pain, but I held him tight, desperate to stop the damage he was causing. As his eyes fluttered closed, his body slumped into my arms, unconscious, but the room felt like it was collapsing in on me.

Suddenly, a sound—something monstrous—screeched from above. A terrifying noise echoed from the roof, like something scraping and dragging itself across the tiles. It was relentless, the roof groaning under the weight of whatever was moving on it. Then, the unmistakable sound of tiles crashing down filled the air, some of them shattering against the pavement below. The violent clatter of debris struck the ground, but it didn’t stop. The creature—or whatever it was—was still moving, as if it was tearing through the house from above.

I could feel the tremors in the walls, vibrating through the very foundation of the house. The sound of heavy, fleshy limbs scraping against the roof grew louder, more frantic. Then, without warning, the sound shifted to the same horrific screech Adam had made, echoing above, but now it was the creature's voice, sending chills down my spine.

I knew what had to be done. I had to protect Adam, and I couldn’t let go of him. My phone started blaring with the alerts from the motion detectors, the camera alarms going off one by one, but I couldn’t take my eyes off Adam. I couldn’t risk letting him out of my arms—*that thing* was still here.

The motion detectors screamed through the house, but just as quickly as they started, everything fell into silence. The camera alerts stopped, the sound of the roof and the creature’s chaos ceased. It was as if the house had fallen completely still.

Adam’s breathing was shallow in my arms as I sat there, frozen, not knowing what to do. The once deafening alarms on my phone had stopped, and the eerie quiet pressed in on me like a heavy weight. Then, slowly, Adam's eyes fluttered open, confusion written across his face as if nothing had happened. He looked at me, his expression shifting to one of concern. I couldn’t hold back the tears anymore. The fear, the confusion, the overwhelming terror—it all poured out as I collapsed against him, shaking uncontrollably.

  


Part 5: Adam



It was difficult to explain what had happened. Adam was confused about why his mouth hurt, why the walls had strange indents in them, and why I was crying. I couldn't bring myself to tell him the truth. How could I explain something so horrifying to a child? If he knew that something had nearly gotten him, how could he ever feel safe again? I told him it was just sleepwalking, that he had rubbed his mouth raw, though I knew it was something much darker. As for the marks on the walls, I said I’d fallen down the stairs. If he were any older, the lies wouldn’t have worked, but I needed him to believe me, to stay calm.

I wanted to leave, to run as far away as possible, but I couldn't be sure the thing wouldn't follow us. The last thing I wanted was to put anyone else in danger. I needed to protect Adam, and I needed to understand what this creature was, what it wanted with him.

The next morning, I found the motion sensors and cameras I had set up all broken, lying on the ground. I checked the footage, but all I saw was a quick blur before the lens shattered. Whatever it was didn’t want to be seen. The noises from that night, Adam’s screams, the voice of that thing—it still echoed in my mind. I couldn’t shake it.

That day, I bought new cameras and motion detectors, including ones for the roof. The chimney had been damaged, and I found debris the next morning. I set up the new equipment, working through the morning until I was sure everything was secure. As night fell, I took every precaution I could think of. I moved furniture against doors, told Adam it was for a bad storm. He didn’t question it and went back to his movie.

I couldn’t afford to let this thing get any closer. Every second felt like an eternity. Adam sat there, absorbed in his movie, unaware of the nightmare creeping closer. He was so innocent, so safe in his little world, while mine was falling apart.

When the movie ended, Adam fell asleep on the couch next to me. I kissed his forehead and turned off the TV, sitting in the silence, waiting. The clock showed 2:00 AM. I knew it was out there. I stood up and checked the cameras. Nothing. I felt the weight of the silence. The crickets outside, the only sound, offered no comfort—they were just a reminder that I was alone.

Then, the crickets stopped. A chill washed over me, the kind you can’t ignore. I felt it in my gut—it was close. My phone vibrated. I checked the alert.

*Motion detected at the Front Porch.*

My heart raced as I opened the camera feed. In the distance, a figure stood in the shadows. Tall, thin, its limbs twisting in unnatural ways. It knew I was watching, like it wanted me to see it. The figure bent and contorted before crawling back into the darkness. I felt nauseous.

I returned to Adam, still asleep on the couch, but just as I sat down, the phone buzzed again—another alert. This time, I heard the crash from the front porch, the light flickered, and then went dark. Another crash, louder this time, and I realized the camera had been destroyed. Something had thrown a rock at it.

I wouldn’t let it bait me. I couldn’t leave Adam.

Minutes passed, and then I heard it—whispering. At first, too faint to make out, but soon it grew louder. The voice stopped at a level just low enough for me to hear it clearly. And then I felt it—something moved beside me. Adam was awake. The whispers were for him. I knew that if it got close enough, it would do something horrible.

I pulled Adam close, holding him tightly, whispering to him, "Everything is going to be okay. I won’t let you get hurt, I love you."

The whispering faded, replaced by silence. But then, from the darkness outside, I heard it—*my* voice, twisted and evil.

“I’m not gonna let you get hurt, Adam.”

It sent a cold shiver through me. The voice was guttural, wrong, like it had been tortured, yet it sounded strangely like me. I tried to keep my composure.

“I don’t know what you are, but you can’t have my son. Get out of here!”

The silence was deafening, then suddenly a heavy slam against the door. The house shook. The knocking started again—soft at first, then with more force. Each knock became harder, more desperate, until the door rattled violently. Adam began to cry.

“ADDDAAAMMM!”

I ran to the door, shoving the chair I had placed against it, but the eyes—two glowing points—stared back at me from the other side. Even though I couldn’t see the face, I could feel the rage.

I ran back to Adam, holding him as tightly as I could, trying to comfort him, but the yelling from outside was unbearable. The house felt like it was shaking apart. We both screamed, the world feeling like it was collapsing around us. Then, suddenly, everything went silent.

I uncovered my ears, confused. No sound, only our breathing. I opened the curtain to check, and the porch was empty, the camera broken. I sighed in relief, pulling Adam into my arms. It was over.

  


I pulled away and held his head between my hands as I smiled and kissed him on his forehead. A smile illuminated off his face and I felt as if I was once again looking at my wife. I hugged him and scouted around the house to make sure that nothing was there. Once I felt good enough to say that it was just us I made my way out of my bedroom and began my walk down the stairs. I stopped for a moment and looked at the indents that the monster had left and thought of how much we had been through and started to cry. I gathered myself and began my walk back downstairs when I felt a buzz in my pocket. A familiar alert echoed in the staircase and I pulled up my screen to see the alert that made my whole body feel limp.



*Motion detected on the roof*



A second later I heard the ripping of tiles and the loud screeching of metal being torn apart at the top of the chimney. I instantly started to run down the stairs with tears still in my eyes. I turned the corner and ran into the living room to see Adam standing near the chimney with the TV remote in his hand. His smile illuminated the room and he looked at me with such joy that it made the tears fly out of my eyes more and more quickly. I knew now that it had waited just for the right time, just in time for Adam to be in reach. I had to be quicker than it, I had to. With all my force I started to dart to him and reach out my arms screaming at him to come to me. A look of confusion filled his face and I started to see the rocks and ash from the chimney fall to the ground behind him.



“Daddy? I just wanted to see if you wanted to watch-”



Just as my fingertip was an inch from his hand, I watched as a long and scrawny arm came from the chimney and wrapped around Adam. With precision and quickness, I watched as fear struck Adam and he began to scream before the arm jolted him into the brick smashing his head against the hard chimney entrance. Then both the arm and Adam disappeared into the chimney ahead. With all the momentum I fell onto the ground in front of the chimney as blood dripped onto the floor around me and onto my hands. I screamed in agony as all I could hear from the opening ahead was the screaming of Adam getting more and more distant as the thing carried him far away.



I needed to write about this so that I could get this story out to the public. I have never saw what this thing was again and I hope I never do. Each second I think of Adam, of Maria, of how I could have done more. I couldn’t protect them from the dangers that come from on and out of this world and I beat myself up every waking second for it. I hope that someone out there can understand what I’ve gone through, but I know that’s not possible. If you read this, don’t feel sorry for me, I deserve this. Each night I look into the stars and think of Adam, of where he might be. Sometimes I hope that Maria and him are looking back at me, but I don’t know if that’s true. It got what it wanted from me and it tricked me. I want to send this story as a message and a warning to the world. We aren’t alone and this thing. It walks among us.
