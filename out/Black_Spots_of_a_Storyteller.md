I was once a young man full of life. Had everything I wanted. Roof over my head, girls left and right, money, health. Everything. 
One day that everything changed. 

I saw a spot. 

A little black dot in my peripheral vision. I tried looking at it but it moved with my eye. 
That gave me the answer it wasn’t a spider on the wall at least. 
This was the first that I ever remember one actually sticking around. Normally they’re gone as soon as I look towards them. 
Ghost spiders. 
This one was weirdly staying, 
It annoyed me for maybe 10 minutes or so and then it either went away or I stopped noticing it. 
Forgot all about it. 

Every single one I saw after has engrained themselves in me now, I remember every detail and what they led to. 

The second one I saw was when I woke up one morning all blurry eyed a couple of days later. I stumbled to the bathroom to relieve myself and when I looked up, my eyes focused quickly and sharply on my reflection in the mirror. It made me jump and I nearly fell back, even if I was wide awake it would have shocked me. 
But then there it was.

The glimpse of a black dot in the corner of the mirror. It was the same as the first, sticking around. 
Darting my eyes back and forth as my vision sorted itself out, it moved with my eye. 
The first dot was now painfully noticeable again too. 
This one however made me feel different, like I was avoiding eye contact with someone. 

The third, fourth and fifth came together in random areas. 
They were all relatively small, luckily not being too much of an obstacle to get over. 
I decided to see an Optometrist, they said it would eventually disappear. It was just “debris” on the eye. Nothing at all to worry about. 
So I went home and hoped that’s exactly what would happen, despite it already being a week since the first dot. 

Then peace. Nothing at all. A whole week without seeing a spot, I started to go back to normal. 
Not simultaneously but in the same day, two of them. 
Thought I’d do the morning ritual, yawn, go for a wee etc, but instead I was greeted with the usual blurred vision but then yet another black spot on the right hand side. 
Bigger than the others and with a different texture. It looked different somehow, more rubbery maybe? Or was it just my memory and they’ve always looked like that and I’m only just noticing?
It blocked my view of things more than the others, compared, it was an actual annoyance, one that would definitely take time to get used to. One i’d definitely be angry about for a while. 

Eventually, after a few minutes of trying to look at it and figure it out, I gave up and got up. 

I went about my day, occasionally hitting things and knocking them over. 
I called in sick at work and tried to watch tv, having my head at an angle like I wasn’t really watching but staring into space or watching the paint on my wall dry somehow dryer. 
It was the only way I could see the full screen. 

I curled up into a ball and broke down, my thoughts raced, the first two I got fully used to, but it was getting worse and worse with each new one. I had no idea how many more would come. Would it eventually block everything out? Was I destined to eternally see blackness? Would it go away? 
The optician said it was only debris, and the second time I went they said the exact same thing and that they could not see anything else or new, in or around my eyes. 
They even checked the backs of my eyes, I try to block that memory out. 

Everything was apparently fine. 
But it wasn’t at all. I was going blind and nobody even knew how. These damn black dots coming and never going, making sure it’s damn difficult to live. 
I clicked a few buttons on my remote until the tv started to make background noise for me and fell asleep. 
When I awoke it was 23:30. 
Half an hour till midnight. 
It broke me a little more when I realised the larger dot still sat in its own space. 

I tried lying back down but as soon as I dropped, the final black spot appeared. 
It covered the middle of my vision fully, I think it was a perfect circle. Like I was looking at a very close pupil staring back into my own pupil. 

Then it opened. 
Moving like a door, the previous black dot acting as a doorknob and moving through this new giant dot, eventually stopping on the other side. 
The newest dot now had the same kind of blackness the second had, one like an empty abyss staring at you. Watching your every move. Silently judging. Unknowing what it wants but still observing, making you perpetually uncomfortable. 

Then I thought I heard a voice. It did and didn’t make sound my ears could percieve but was still somehow drilled into my head to make sure I knew everything it said all at once.
I know that doesn’t make sense but it’s the only way I could describe it.
It told me to collect and tell stories of its kind. 
Nothing else. 
The blackness then grew again. It had finally blinded me. 

A wave of panic hit, I could feel beads of sweat forming on my forehead and tears in my blackened eyes. 
I’d already been scared of losing my sight but now everything I’d known had been flipped on its head. Voices?
This blackness was sentient?

Suddenly, transparent words appeared like writing in a book, a strange font in a language I’d never seen but somehow I knew exactly what they spelled out. 
It was only through those words I could see any sort of light, they were my saviour to the prominent black. 
The words spoke to me again inside and out, the same way they had previously. 

When I succeed in my mission, I will be the only human left on earth who can still see. 
I just need to read out the words that appear, tell the stories they tell me. 
Replace them with new ones I collect from others and spread on. 
The more I tell, the stronger the blackness becomes, the more it spreads through its words, infecting everyone that reads or hears them. 
I need to remind humanity who the true enemy is. Who not any god could compete with. 
One that is neither alive nor dead, only blackness.

I don’t know what happens when it ends, when everyone has been taken over. No idea what I’ll see that nobody else ever will. 
Take some solace in knowing you won’t witness it. 

I wonder if my story will be the final story, the one to black out the last man or woman alive as well as the first to infect another. 

I’m truly sorry for this. I had to do it.
If you’d lost your sight and went through the things I have, what would you do?
So now I have no one, no home, nothing, destined to travel this world, spreading this eternal darkness. Stay strong when you see your first black spot and you might become a storyteller alongside me. 

Welcome to the Black.
