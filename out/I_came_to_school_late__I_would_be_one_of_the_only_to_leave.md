When I woke up this morning, the sun was already peeking through the blinds. I glanced at my alarm clock: 8:15 AM. School had started 15 minutes ago.

“Great,” I muttered, dragging myself out of bed. It wasn’t the first time this had happened. I wasn’t exactly the most popular kid in the 11th grade, and I didn’t have anyone who cared enough to notice if I was late or absent. I figured I’d just slip in quietly, sit through the day, and head home to my usual routine: gaming and dodging my parents’ passive-aggressive remarks.

By the time I got to school, the parking lot was almost empty except for a few teacher cars. That was weird; it was usually packed. I parked at the edge of the lot, near the wooded area that lined the campus, and jogged up to the main doors.

They were locked.

I frowned. “What the hell?” I whispered to myself. Through the glass, I could see the hallway lights were on. Locking the doors during school hours wasn’t normal. I was about to knock when I noticed something off. The halls weren’t just empty; they were silent.

Completely silent.

Usually, you could hear faint murmurs of voices or the squeak of sneakers on the gym floor. Today, there was nothing.

I pulled out my phone to text one of the few classmates I occasionally spoke to—Ben, a kid from my history class who sometimes shared notes with me. But when I opened my messages, I noticed I had missed three alerts from the school:
“LOCKDOWN IN EFFECT. DO NOT ENTER THE BUILDING.”

My stomach dropped. Lockdown? Was there a shooter? My first instinct was to leave, but something about the stillness in the air made me stay. Against all logic, I decided to walk around the building to check if any other entrances were open.

As I rounded the back corner, I saw it.

The side door was propped open, just slightly. A faint red smear trailed from the edge of the door into the darkness of the hallway. My breath hitched. I didn’t want to go in—I should’ve just turned around and driven home. But something in my gut told me I had to know what was happening.

I stepped inside, careful not to touch the door. The metallic scent of blood hit me immediately, sharp and overwhelming.

The hallway was a mess. Desks were overturned, papers were scattered everywhere, and there were more smears of red leading toward the cafeteria. My heart pounded as I crept forward, avoiding the pools of blood that dotted the floor.

That’s when I saw the first body.

It was slumped against a locker, a student I vaguely recognized from chemistry class. His face was pale, his eyes wide open but glassy. There was no gunshot wound. His chest had been torn open, as if something had clawed him apart.

I gagged, stumbling backward, and nearly tripped over another body. This one was missing its head.

I ran.

I didn’t know where I was going, but I couldn’t stop moving. The air felt heavier the deeper I went into the school, like something was watching me. I turned a corner and froze.

A figure stood at the end of the hallway.

It wasn’t human.

Its skin was gray and mottled, stretched taut over a skeletal frame. Its limbs were impossibly long, ending in sharp, claw-like fingers. Blood dripped from its mouth, which stretched too wide, revealing rows of jagged teeth.

It tilted its head toward me, as if it were studying me, and let out a low, guttural growl.

I didn’t think. I just ran, bursting into the nearest classroom and slamming the door behind me. I locked it and crawled under a desk, trying to control my breathing.

That’s when I noticed the other survivor.

She was sitting in the corner of the room, clutching a baseball bat. Her face was streaked with blood—not hers, I hoped—and she looked just as terrified as I felt.

“Don’t make a sound,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “It hears everything.”

“What is it?” I managed to choke out.

She shook her head. “I don’t know. It came out of nowhere. It’s not just one of them, either. There’s more.”

My stomach twisted. “More?”

She nodded, her eyes wide. “I saw them take the principal. They didn’t kill him… at first. They dragged him to the gym.”

I didn’t want to know what happened next.

I was one of the few who made it out alive. The girl with the baseball hat—her name was Nina—she didn’t make it. She’d tried to fight back when one of the creatures broke into the classroom, giving me enough time to escape through the window. I didn’t even see her die.

I spent weeks in shock after the incident. The authorities claimed it was a mass shooting. They wouldn’t—or couldn’t—acknowledge what I’d seen. “Trauma does strange things to the mind,” they told me. But I know what I saw.

My parents thought moving away would help, so we left town within a month. I transferred to another school, but I barely lasted a semester. I couldn’t focus. I couldn’t walk through the halls without hearing those guttural growls or imagining blood smeared across the walls.

I dropped out before the end of 11th grade.

Now, I’m homeschooled, though I barely keep up with the work. Most days, I just sit in my room, curtains drawn, waiting for the nightmares to stop. Waiting for the feeling of being watched to go away.

But it doesn’t.

Sometimes, late at night, I hear the faint scrape of claws against glass.
