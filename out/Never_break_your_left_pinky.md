There was once a killer known only as "The Pinky Slayer." The Pinky Slayer targeted people who had broken their left pinky and would hunt them down no matter where they went. The reason for this strange obsession with the left pinky was unknown, but rumors circulated that the Pinky Slayer had suffered a similar injury themselves.

The first victim was found with their left pinky finger removed and a note was left at the scene that read, "You broke your promise." From that day on, reports of similar murders started to surface all over the world. The victims were always found with their left pinky missing and the same message left behind.

People started to live in fear, not only of the Pinky Slayer but of breaking their left pinky. They would go to great lengths to protect their pinkies, even going as far as wearing casts and splints 24/7. But no matter what precautions they took, the Pinky Slayer always found a way to get to them.

The police were unable to catch the Pinky Slayer and their methods of finding the victims were always a mystery. Some speculated that the Pinky Slayer had supernatural abilities, while others believed that they were a highly skilled hacker who could access medical records.

As time passed, the number of victims continued to rise and the Pinky Slayer became a legend. People whispered about the killer in hushed tones, afraid that speaking their name aloud would bring the Pinky Slayer to their door.

But even to this day, no one knows the true identity of the Pinky Slayer or why they have this strange obsession with the left pinky. And for those who have broken their left pinky, the fear of becoming the next victim never fades away.

One day, a young woman named Sarah broke her left pinky finger while playing soccer. She went to the hospital, got her finger splinted, and went home, thinking nothing more of it. But little did she know that she had just become the Pinky Slayer's next target.

Days passed and Sarah started to notice strange things happening. She received mysterious phone calls in the middle of the night, only to hear silence on the other end. Her computer would randomly shut down and strange symbols would appear on her screen. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched.

One night, as she was getting ready for bed, she heard a strange noise coming from outside her window. She cautiously approached the window and peered through the blinds. That's when she saw a figure in a black hoodie, holding a knife. She screamed and ran to the phone to call the police. But before she could dial the number, the figure broke into her room.

Sarah fought for her life, but the Pinky Slayer was too strong. They overpowered her and before she lost consciousness, she saw the Pinky Slayer reach for her left pinky finger.

The next morning, Sarah's body was found with her left pinky missing and the same message left behind, "You broke your promise." The police were baffled by the case, unable to understand the Pinky Slayer's motivations.
