Since I was a kid, I’ve known that I had no interest in trying to survive in an apocalyptic world. 

“End of the world” movies were always a favorite of mine, but they taught me pretty quickly that survival was something I was not interested in. As I got older, I held firm in my belief that surviving an apocalypse was just not on my “to do” list.

I didn’t want to sit around waiting to die. I didn’t want to deal with scavenging for food or looking for shelter. I didn’t want to fight or kill my fellow neighbor just in an attempt to survive. 

If the time ever came, I planned to take the first opportunity available to… “remove” myself from this world. A short life is better than a chaotic one, right?

Now, to preface this, I never *really* thought this would happen. The apocalypse was something that you only saw in the movies! I’d never thought I would *actually* be in this situation; but here we are. All it took was a combination of crooked politics, a pandemic, the rise of AI… and just like that, countries are blowing each other up.

I always thought that I would say my goodbyes to the world when the apocalypse started, but things didn’t go quite as planned.

First, my area had not been directly hit, so there was no immediate danger or threat. If I’m not in danger, it’s not time to go yet, right? 

Then, there was my husband. We took vows, and “til death do us part” was part of that. I couldn’t leave him behind to deal with this by himself, right?

We still had food and shelter. We were still healthy and relatively safe. The rest of the world was definitely in ruins, but *we* were still okay. So, I decided to stay.

The first few weeks were hard, but not impossible; but by the end of Month 3, everything had changed.

Our home was gone, wiped out by a bomb.

My husband was gone - killed by that bomb.

Our city had been wiped off the map; *no one* was left. It was a miracle I survived - but I had been out foraging for food when it hit. 

Now I had no food, no shelter, no neighbors, and no partner. 

It was finally time. Time to go.

I placed the cold barrel of the revolver to my temple; a slight tremble in my hand. I knew this was my only answer, but I was still scared.

I took a deep breath and pictured my husband’s smiling face; the idea of being with him again helped me relax. This was the right thing to do.

With the tremble in my hand now gone, I held my breath as I squeezed the trigger, bracing myself for pain, followed by darkness and relief. 

There was a deafening noise, extreme pain, and the room was covered in blood… but I was still alive. 

“What happened?” I thought, as I looked around the room. The amount of blood and brains on the wall *should* mean I’m dead, yet here I was looking at it with my own eyes.

I walked to a nearby shattered window, catching my reflection in a piece of dangling glass. The top of my head was gone, but I no longer felt pain. I was able to walk, and breathe, and think… 

“Oh no,” I thought, “oh no, oh no, oh no!”

What a terrible time to learn that I’m immortal.
