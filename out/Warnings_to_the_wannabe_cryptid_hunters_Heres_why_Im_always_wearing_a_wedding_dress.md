Just to remind you all, this happened when I was nineteen. It's sort of a continuation of [what I told you about last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1071bxu/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_jacek_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and like it says in the title, this is gonna explain why I'm always in a wedding dress. I know some of you have been aching to hear about that.

I had just met the son of my mother's deceased childhood friend, namely Jacek, the new Lord of the black mill. My feelings towards him were complicated; for one, he scared me shitless, but he was also the hottest guy I'd ever met. I was rather certain he liked me, too. 

My little brother and I always went ice skating on the lake by the mill, the sole reason being that Jacek would see me. He would watch us every time, keeping his distance for courtesy's sake. I'd meet his gaze, show him I knew, but nothing more. One time, he actually waved to me in that "come hither"-kind of way, and all I did was shake my head. He went back inside, slamming the door so hard that the sound reverberated across the twin lakes. 

That day, I waited until dark to return to the mill. I knocked on Jacek's door, and though it took him a while to answer, the look on his face was well worth the wait.

"Hi," he said.

"Hi."

Silence. Then, "Fiona, what are you doing here?"

"Saying hi." 

"That's… that's it? Fiona, it's two a.m., you're in the middle of the woods—aren't you cold?"

"Freezing." I smiled, hearing him swallow when the gears started turning.

Making haste to step aside, he held the door open for me. "It's really much warmer in here."

I walked past him, hugging myself. "Still kinda chilly."

"I have a bed, too," Jacek suggested readily.

Said bed wasn't much more comfortable than the floor; a comparison founded on factual evidence. Two days later, we tried mine instead, and thus, Jacek climbing up the wall of the house and onto my balcony at night became a regular occurrence. Though he was a few years my senior, he hadn't been with another woman before—not too surprising, all things considered. So let's just say I had some explaining to do. But feeling wanted by him was the most intense sensation I had experienced since my soul had run off on me. He knew I'd been crazy about him from the start as well. Sharing this deep admiration for one another was amazing. 

We got along great on a personal level, too. He introduced me to the hellhound he'd summoned for company and taught me some basic spells that weren't necessarily *black* magic, just useful, not-unholy witchery. I'd read to him—not that he couldn't, he merely hated the eyestrain—and take him out into town occasionally to show him the basics of modern human life. He was a bit of a pyromaniac, but I thought it was cool that he could light a fire using nothing but sticks and rocks. So crafty. In hindsight, he was really kind of perfect. I can't think of any man I'd ever respected or felt more attracted to. 

But something was missing, and of course things went wrong. I should have really seen it coming when he asked me to marry him.

"Jacek, we've known each other for five months."

"My parents knew each other for three, what are you saying? Too soon for you?"

"Yeah, way too soon. Three months might have worked for them, but not me. Sorry."

"Okay, okay. I hear you. I'll wait."

He asked again six months later and was absolutely bewildered when I still told him no. "Honestly, how long do you wanna wait?"

"I'm not sure. I'm just not there yet, you know."

"It's been close to a year!"

"Exactly, not even a full twelve months."

Jacek threw his arms up. "Fine, I'll wait another year, for pity's sake."

Now, I thought there wouldn't *be* another year. He was just asking for too much too fast, and besides—I hadn't even thought of the implications of such a marriage, and I refused to. I didn't *love* Jacek. I wasn't sure I could really love anybody. Too much of me was missing for such a strong emotion. I never told him that, but he never asked either, and I understood soon enough that he simply took it for granted. He figured that since we were sleeping together, that had to mean I loved him and would marry him someday. He wasn't at fault for thinking that way. Our concepts of love were simply worlds apart. The problem was that I could never bring myself to inform him of that. 

Being with him made me feel good, and I pushed back the thoughts of our inevitable break-up, procrastinating for my own sake while he kept growing more and more attached. I tried to delude myself into believing that he didn't actually want to marry me. How would that even work? My family had no idea we were an item, he lived in a haunted mill in what was still my parents' land, and who the hell would even wed us? The Devil?

He just had to know all this, right? He had to know we could never be for real.

Well, he didn't. I found out about that when he asked me again two years later. I couldn't take it anymore, I knew I was stringing him along and that I had been doing so for far too long. It was wintertime again, and we'd been on a scenic little walk around the twin lakes, careful to avoid the guards on their rounds. 

"About that," I began hesitantly, "I don't think we can really go into that direction."

Jacek stopped in his tracks. "Elaborate."

"You don't *actually* see this going anywhere, do you? I mean, we can't get married. It's just not an option."

His brows furrowed. "It would be, if you wanted to."

"Then I guess I don't," I said meekly, my throat bone dry. 

"Why?" His voice was the same monotonous, flat bass he'd used when talking about the loss of his father.

"Did you never… stop to think about it all?" 

"Wouldn't have asked you thrice if I didn't."

"Yes, but I mean the big picture," I stammered, fumbling for words. "It'd be kinda complicated, no?"

"Most good things are. Mom and Dad had their own problems, but they were happy."

"We're not your mom and dad, though," I argued. "I don't wanna stay in these woods forever! I know my mother wants me to, but, like… I'm gonna leave this shit behind someday. Not anytime soon, but someday."

"Yeah, so? I'd come with you."

"You've literally sworn yourself to the Devil!"

"Exactly. I've got amazing outside connections."

"Jacek, no… There's just no way."

"I don't get you," he said blankly. "What did I do wrong?"

"Nothing, this is just… out of your control."

"Don't you love me?" he asked.

I fell silent. I felt beyond cruel; my face was burning with shame and something in my chest seemed to break. There was an actual, physical sensation; a sting so painful I kind of wanted to check if there wasn't a knife sticking out of my body somewhere. 

"Don't you love me?" Jacek repeated, taking a step towards me. 

I very slightly shook my head. Then, I was treated to a thoroughly unwholesome sight. I could actually make out the second his heart broke. It was this single, awful moment when his eyes flew open and all his features seemed to derail.

"Fucking hell, Fiona! It's been three years!" 

Hot tears started rolling down my cheeks. "I'm sorry."

"You never thought to mention any of that? I thought you just needed more time…" He started sputtering, pale face turning red as his shoulders began to tremble. "Why the fuck would you do that to me?" he howled, and I instinctively took a step back.

"Please, calm down…"

"No, I won't calm the hell down! What were you thinking? Did you *like* it?" 

I listened in horror as his voice got deeper and deeper, slowly contorting into a warped, chill-inducing growl as his face twisted into a grimace of wrath and pain. This wasn't the same man I'd walked alongside mere minutes ago. This was something else, and I didn't want to find out what.

"*Did you like playing me for a fool?*"

"Jacek, what's happening to you?" I pressed out.

"*You should know! You're doing it!*"

I kept on stumbling backwards, trying to distance myself from him, but he kept on inching towards me, taking weirdly slow, wonky steps. His whole body was twitching like a distorted image on a glitching screen. My heart sank at the sound of bones cracking. His knees were slowly turning *inside out*, accompanied by the most awful noise I'd ever heard, a grinding crunch. 

Jacek's legs gave way beneath him and he dropped to the ground, curling up as he began to cough violently. The blood he threw up painted the pristine snow in the darkest shade of red I'd ever seen. I was panicking, screaming at the top of my lungs. Caution thrown to the wind, I'd flung myself to the ground beside him, grabbing him, holding him, cradling him as he kept on spitting and wheezing. I tried to keep his head still as he kept bashing it into the ground in his frenzy, his eyes unnaturally wide and filled with mindless terror. 

Then, all of a sudden, it was over. Jacek let out one last, long cry as his body seemed to violently stretch itself, stiffening like a board as his bones snapped back into place. For a moment, he merely laid there on his back in the tossed over, bloodied snow, his limbs slowly relaxing and his voice returning to normal as he slowly but surely managed to catch his breath.

He opened his eyes to meet my gaze. The warmth had vanished from them completely, and the iciness left over sent chills down my spine. I recoiled, raising my hands to grouch my burning throat. My heart was still drumming wildly, my pulse racing in my ears. I was beyond dazed, the horror of the situation not relinquishing its grip on me.

"What was that?" I finally breathed. 

Jacek pushed himself up onto his elbows, gazing up into the gray sky. "I'm sorry," he muttered absently. "My body works a little differently. I'm okay now."

"I don't understand," I whispered.

He slowly turned to face me, opening his jacket and peeling aside his shirt. I froze in my spot. Cold dread crept into my core upon laying eyes in his chest. 

There was a *hole*.

A big, black, oozing hole right where his heart was supposed to be. Blood was still dripping from the edges, framed by flayed skin and protruding bits of torn flesh.

"No." It was all I could say. "Jacek, I'm so sorry…"

He let out a soft little chuckle as he got to his feet. "Oh, you will be." He grabbed a fistful of the tainted red snow, and before I could react, he smeared it right across my face. "Stay seated, it's okay," he muttered. "This won't hurt a bit." An amused smile spread on his face as he knelt down in front of me and started piling fresh snow on my lap. I was still too shocked to move; I just stared at him in confusion before finally breaking out of my stupor and batting his hand away. 

He smirked. "Too late."

"What?"

"You made me real angry, you know. And I have to move on like this. This—" He tapped his chest. "—this isn't gonna heal anytime soon. It wouldn't be fair if you just got to go back to normal. Oh, don't worry, you'll look so wonderful."

"The fuck are you talking about?" I brushed off the snow, staggering to my feet, only to realize that the gray coat I'd been wearing had turned into a long, white skirt. Feeling the sting of the cold on my bare shoulders, I noticed that the only thing shielding my upper body from the elements was a thin layer of lace. My very first wedding dress. Jacek was doubling over with laughter. It echoed through the forest and then turned into loud, shivering sobs and wails again as he started walking off, leaving me to stare and shudder.

I never saw him again after that. It didn't take me long to figure out what exactly he had done to me—I couldn't wear normal clothes anymore. They would singe my skin like fire, and biting through the pain wasn't an option, for they would fall off by themselves if I kept them on for longer than a couple minutes. Since my only alternative was walking around in my underwear, I resigned myself and started buying up all kinds of bridal gowns. 

So that's why I hate talking about Jacek. Casimir loves that story, he thinks it's hilarious, but I don't like it nearly as much.
