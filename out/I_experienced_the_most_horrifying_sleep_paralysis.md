A few weeks ago, I underwent surgery for the discovery and removal of endometriosis. They basically made three small incisions. One on each side of my abdomen and one in my belly button. Thankfully, the surgery went smoothly, and I was back home resting the same day.

My doctor explained to me that it will most likely be uncomfortable to sleep on my side. So I propped myself up on my pillow and planned to sleep on my back until I felt more at ease. The first night after my surgery I experienced what I can only describe as sleep paralysis, which I hadn’t had since I was a teen, and never like this.

My bed is positioned against the wall, facing the door to the hallway. To my right is a window without curtains or blinds. That night, I awoke in the dark, completely unable to move. Panic surged through me at first, but I slowly calmed myself, telling myself that I was either dreaming or experiencing sleep paralysis. 

As I talked myself down, I noticed something was off about my room. I could see everything clearly, yet the window was enveloped in an unnatural darkness, as if a heavy blanket had been hung over it from the outside. The hallway, too, was an abyss of darkness. Then, I heard a faint sound of movement in the hallway. 

At first, the noise was distant, but it grew clearer as it got closer to my bedroom. Footsteps echoed in the silence, followed by tapping, sounding like fingers drumming in a line. As fear tightened its grip on me, I grasped for any rational explanation. 

And then I saw it. A hand emerged from the darkness, gripping the top of the door frame, its fingers tapping rhythmically against the wood trim. Slowly, a tall, spindly figure crouched under the door frame and entered my room. It was impossibly tall, with its head tilted awkwardly against the ceiling, its arms long enough to touch the floor.

I couldn’t see its face clearly or any distinct features. It began crawling on all fours closer to my bed, my silent panic escalated. I tried to will my body to move, to close my eyes, but I was frozen. The creature stopped right beside me, looming over me, and I screamed internally as it lifted its hand above me.

To my shock, it began poking me, its long, bony fingers pressing into my body with a force that hurt. It felt as if hours passed as it methodically prodded me, moving from one spot to another until it reached my belly button. Hysteria washed over me; my thoughts raced, and my body ached from its relentless probing.

Hovering its finger over my belly button, it slowly pressed down, hard. Suddenly, it spoke. A deep, raspy voice, slightly muffled, It almost sounded like it was talking through a cookout drive through speaker. “It’s so much easier when they’re already open,” it said, before pushing deeper into me. 

The sensation was excruciating, like lava scorching my insides. I screamed in my mind and begged for it to stop, but it continued, its finger delving deeper, elbow-deep at this point. I was incoherent, sobbing internally as the pain somehow continued to intensify. 

Then, just like that, I jolted awake, drenched in sweat. My surgery site throbbed painfully for days afterward. I know that the pain was a normal part of recovery, but a lingering doubt keeps haunting me. Was it really just a dream?
