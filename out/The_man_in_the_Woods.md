 

not real story and not real me)

Hi I am a 29 year old man I go to the wood often alone but sometimes I think something is there in the trees I love nature and the beautiful tree and plants there but one day 10 years ago when I first moved here I was 19 at the time.

Me and my friend Tommy and Denis went to the woods to camp for the night I moved here to get in a collage near by Tommy was the wild kid in the group older than me and Denis I was the quiet guy loving books and math and Denis was the rich kid got everything he ever wanted but he was a good guy never showing of his money to others he did not know.

When we where at the woods there was a small trail to the camping areas the walk took 20-30 minutes to get there while walking I saw something moving around i thought that was just my mind playing with me later Denis I where setting up the tens Denis said did you see something moving in the woods.

I said maybe I don't know he said Tommy said something about a man he saw 3 days ago he was just driving then he saw him coming out of the woods he saw him holding something in his hand.

I said to Denis that tommy must just have saw a hunter in the woods.

the woods where filled with many deer bears and wolfs so many people hunt here its now 5:00 the camping ground is super dark Tommy made a fire while me and Denis cooked the ramen we brought we sat down we where just talking about random thing that happened.

Denis said that he liked a girl in our town and Tommy was talking about his new GF while i was just there looking at the night stars when suddenly Denis took out a flashlight and started flaring it around then he stop at a tree he Screamed at the top of his lung's that there was a man.

Tommy pulled out a a price of wood out of the fire he said run take your thing and run we ran for minutes Tommy me and Denis were scared has hell

we finally got to the car the man was behind us Tommy unlock the door and we jumped in the man started banging on the door the car window almost broke but Tommy hit the accelerator we look back at the man from the window he tried to get us but the car was to fast

We promised to never come back here alone again we reported it to the police and the police said that repot of the same man have been coming in we found out later that that man was a sycophant hiding in the forest he was caught but Tommy and Denis never wanted to go back to a forest ever again
