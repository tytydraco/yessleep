This story is going to convince you that I'm evil , immoral, unsympathetic, any unpleasant word you could imagine and that shoe fits .... More times than not ... But there is always someone more twisted than you ... 

I guess this began on a typical "drinking with the boys" night ..... Myself .... My friend Dom and my friend Paxton did what we always did ..... We drank until 3 am and then as was tradition .. We began looking up the social media sites of our ex girlfriend's ... We were all early 40s and and most our relationships happened in our younger years so it was interesting to see what could have been...  And we would occasionally find a girl who gained weight and tease each other "Hey Dom this is ur girl man" ... Insert broken bed jokes and harsh fat jokes ... (remember I am not a good person ) in hindsight I cringe .... We were tools ...the ex gf may have gained weight but she also gained a family ... Kids .. A purpose ... You could see in the family photos genuine happiness ..... Something none of had even sniffed ... Maybe it was jealousy ... That made us want to call her those nasty things.... 



We began running out of exes when my friend Paxton said "anon what about ur girl april?" I scoffed . ... "April ... The one I kissed at the 8th grade dance..." mrs. Religious!! " Dom exclaimed. "Story goes that you have to take a quiz over the bible to round second base" We all laughed because even at 40 we were 4th graders apparently ... I did remember April in fact .... 8th grade dance .... She was eh prolly a 6 out of 10 .. She was nice we always had fun .... But without fail she would ask about my religion and try to convert me before long ... As an atheist it was the worst thing to bring up to me and my interest in her plummeted .... 

Her page loaded .... Not a friend of mine said a word for a minute .... This 6 out of 10 had grown into something that would break the scale .... Her hair was so beautiful herbal hessence really missed the ball not casting her ... Big full lips that did not look like a plastic surgeons Tuesday afternoon .....just perfect and natural ... But her eyes man .... These eyes had an intense heat about them ... There was something so sexy and captivating about them ... Maybe all that praying worked because God had made her an angel .... Perfect face ... Perfect gravity defying breast that seemed to glimmer hope In my life ... Curves and legs for days and her butt was beyond perfection .... I needed her to be mine ... Soon the boys all said they were headed out and with hugs they made there exit ... 

I imagine most guys here would ... Send a message or try and find a number ....but ... Like I said I'm evil ...i'm a coward.. .. I'm an opportunist ... And I'm very good with computers ...



I had a program on my computer that would take all info from social media accounts and generate passwords ... Hers was the third guess on the program

Biscuit2424! ... I could now read her personal messages ... And use that info to be Mr. Right ... I know some of u are disgusted by the invasion of privacy ...at Times I am myself ..but it was already gonna take a miracle to get her attention so I was willing to tip the scales ... 

  
Her convos with Eve ... We're especially helpful ... It seems all they talked about was the ideal guy 

-A man who has faith in Jesus Christ... 

\*As an atheist this was gonna hurt but I'd go to church every Sunday if I just got the chance to spread her like a donation plate \*

- He must see the numbers like me 

\*at first confusing but upon more reading I find out she's super super into Angel numbers ... Ugh another thing to learn ... Dat ass dou ... 

It went on and on

So I saw that she made plans with friends to go to a bar called Purgatory (the irony is not lost on me ) and I decided I was gonna be there .... I wore a shirt that had the numbers 2424 .... Her favorite Angel number ... I brought a bible I was gonna be reading ... I wore a cross necklace  ... I even had a WWJD bracelet on ...

It was karaoke night at the bar and I saw her favorite music was by a Christian band called lifehouse .. I learned the song and put my name in for it .... 

  
I looked all around and began to get nervous ... Maybe she was ditching her friend.... They called me up to sing .... I began to ... And just as I began to give up there she was .... Her eyes were wide ... Noticing my 2424 shirt and the song I think she was almost in shock .... She ooggled me the way I did her pictures... I did feel guilty tho... It was like having gameshark in real life .... This wasn't really me it's that i knew she wanted .... But I'd be anyone for her to look at me this way .... 

  
After I sang I sat down and pretended to read the bible ... After 5 minutes I heard her speak 

 "Great job singing I love your shirt too do I know you ?" she said smiling 

 " I don't believe so but I believe in fate so maybe it our fate to meet tonight hahaha oh and my shirt is Angel numbers they mean 'trust urself and be positive ' 

She looked like she just got wet ... Like holy water was drenching her barstool ... I had nailed tonight... We made out and even grouped each other in my car ... Then I said "sorry I got church tomorrow I better go can we hang again soon ?... She said "please God yes " and I went home beaming.... 

  
Before going to bed I hacked into her stuff and saw she was talking to eve again..

 " I think he's the one eve... I saw him at 9 pm ... His bill at the bar was 9.99 ... We kissed 9 times before we parted ways ... He's the one " 

I was in .... She insisted she picked me up the next day and I agreed .... I began to look at things from a different light tho ... All this Angel number stuff ... I think she was ... Maybe a little too into them ... She seemes slightly unstable .... But then she pulled up in that dress ... And my conscience wasn't gonna beat that dress ... 

  
I got in the car 

She began driving ... She broke the silence .... "I've looked for u for a long time u know " ... Oh yea? I said .. "Ya I just could not cross over without my soul mate u know but all the signs are right and I've never been more sure of anything in my life ..... Eeeeee! I can't wait to be in heaven with u " ... She said excitedly "in heaven huh well" Suddenly she jerked the wheel hard.. It ramped over the siding and  ... We plummeted 100 feet from the bridge to the bank ... I lost conscience immediately... When I woke up I was under water ... Dieing... I panicked and kicked out the car window and began to swim to safety.... I looked back in the car and there she was .... Waving me back to her .... Holding 9 fingers up ...smiling ... Her head gashed open completely .... 

I later find out "999" in Angel numbers means the end of something . ...

  
Moral of the story ...don't manipulate girls to like u ... Because u might get the one who thinks that seeing the numbers  999 4 times a day means to pull a double homicide ... If I had to guess she was probably schizophrenic.... And I am afraid to ... Date ... Anyone now ..... Karma I suppose
