It doesn’t taste good. I don’t know why I like it. Its smell is strange. It always makes me cringe.  And then I drink.

I gulp it down. I drink it all. Bottle after bottle like it’s water and I need it to survive.

There’s something about it. Something that makes me want to drink it. No. It’s more than a want, it’s a need. 

Or maybe it’s just something about me. Something wrong with me. Obviously there’s something wrong with me, I’m drinking antifreeze. And I can’t stop. 

The liquid slithers down my throat. It soothes me like nothing else does. Like nothing else can. 

I drink. And drink. And drink. 

Until everything goes black. 

I wake up feeling sore. Antifreeze always does that to me for some reason. Probably doesn’t help that I fall asleep on the floor. 

Standing up, I stretch and fix myself. I probably look like a mess. I haven’t been able to tell. All the mirrors are black. 

I shrug to myself and pick up another bottle of antifreeze. Somehow, I never seem to run out of these. I shrug that off too.

Just as I’m about to bring the bottle to my lips, my head spins and vision blurs. I crash back against the floor as a loud buzzing pierces my ears. 

“No no no no no” 

“Wake up” 

Voices drift around my head. Flashing lights. A steady beep beep beep beep.

Silence. 

I sit up, my little dizzy spell finally over, and down some antifreeze. These little spells happen every now and again. There’s always this familiar feeling to them. I’m not sure what it means. 

My zoned-out eyes focus on my pale fingers as I slowly take long swigs. I wasn’t always this pale. I don’t know when that happened. It was probably after I stopped going outside.

I haven’t been outside in such a long time. I’m not exactly sure why. I just don’t.

I just sit. Sit and drink. Sit and drink in my dark house. 

The windows are all blacked out. None of the lights work. Or maybe they do and I just don’t turn them on.

It’s always so cold. 

I hate the cold. 

It makes me shiver. It makes my fingers numb. My fingers are so numb I drop my bottle. It spills on the floor.

I bite my tongue as I scramble onto my feet, mourning the loss of the sweet liquid. Looking down at the spill, I almost jump at my reflection. My skin isn’t just pale. It’s pasty, patchy, and sort of cracked. I look worse than sickly. I look dead.

Peering closer, I discover the worst feature peering back at me. My eyes. They’re dull, glazed over and white. 

I stare for a long moment. I can’t tear my eyes away. 

Then I shrug and drink another bottle of antifreeze. 

It doesn’t taste good. I don’t know why I like it. Its smell is strange. It always makes me cringe. And then I drink. 

I gulp it down. I drink it all.
