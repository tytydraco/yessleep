*Hello. Before reading this, I would like to say that I am a 15-year-old (don't be creepy, guys) who's a huge fan of horror stories, especially psychological horror. Throughout the pandemic, I loved reading* r/nosleep *stories while I was bored, especially reading one story that is now one of my favorites (please check this story out, it's amazing), "*[*Something walks whistling past my house every night at 3:03.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dyqd5e/something_walks_whistling_past_my_house_every/)*" I decided to take action and start writing my own stories, and this is the first one that I've ever written. I'm sorry if it's pretty short and not to your liking, but I would appreciate a reply, a review/rating, and/or some suggestions for my writing skills. Thank you, and enjoy!*  


Throughout my life, I have been aware of the shadowy, intangible forces that have plagued my mind, leaving me grappling with the weight of both schizophrenia and depression for many years. Yet, through the struggles that have punctuated my life, I have developed a deep sense of empathy and understanding for those who also face the demons of mental illness, fueling a desire to help others that have become a defining feature of my life. The culmination of this drive came in the form of my attainment of the coveted title of "Dr. Emily Adams," a momentous achievement that I knew would change the course of my life in ways that were both profound and transformative.

However, on this particular night, as I made my rounds in the towering edifice that was the psychiatric hospital, I couldn't shake the feeling of dread that gripped me. The patient's agonized cries seemed to reverberate through the walls, echoing my own feelings of hopelessness and despair.

As I pushed open the door to the patientâ€™s room, I saw the fear in his eyes and recognized it all too well. For a moment, I forgot that I was the one meant to be helping him; instead, I felt a sense of shared terror that engulfed us both. The hospital's walls seemed to close in around us, suffocating us with a darkness that seeped into our very souls. I caught only a few words from his quivering lips.

*"It's coming for me," he whispered. "Can't you hear it? It's getting closer."*

I tried to approach him, but he recoiled in terror as if I were the one who was out to get him. I brushed it off as paranoia, but as the night progressed, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.

The hospital was an old building, and its walls seemed to have a life of their own. I could feel them watching me, their eyes following my every move. I tried to push the feeling aside, but it only grew stronger.

As I made my rounds, I saw the patients becoming more agitated. They were all muttering the same thing.

*"It's coming. It's here."*

I tried to call for backup, but the phone lines were dead. The power had gone out, and the emergency generator wasn't working. The hospital was plunged into darkness, and the patients' screams echoed through the halls.

As I found myself trapped in the suffocating darkness of the hospital, my heart pounding in my chest, I realized that I was no longer in control. The hospital's architecture seemed to be changing before my very eyes, and the once-familiar corridors had become a labyrinth of twists and turns. Every step I took felt like it was leading me further away from escape.

My senses were in a constant state of heightened awareness, alert to every sound and movement that surrounded me. The creaking of the floors beneath my feet, the groaning of the walls, and the whispered voices that seemed to come from nowhere filled my mind with a sense of dread.

With each passing moment, my terror grew, as I became increasingly aware of an insidious presence that lurked just beyond my sight. Shadows darted and flickered in the periphery of my vision, and I could feel the eyes of unseen entities boring into my soul.

My mind was fraying at the edges, and I knew that my grip on reality was slipping. I tried to convince myself that it was all just a hallucination, a byproduct of my own shattered mental state. But the feeling of the hospital's warm breath on the back of my neck was all too real.

It was then that I realized the true nature of this place. The hospital was alive, a sentient entity that fed on the suffering of its patients. It was a monster that thrived on the fear and pain that it inflicted upon those trapped within its walls.

Despite my best efforts, the hospital claimed me as its latest victim. I was swallowed up by the darkness, consumed by the very thing that had once been my sanctuary. My fate was sealed, and my body was never found.

To this day, the horrors that took place within the hospital's walls continue to haunt those who knew the truth. The secrets of the asylum are buried deep, but the memories of the terror that took place within its halls remain etched in the minds of all who witnessed it.
