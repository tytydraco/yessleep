As I shoved the alien mucus into my mouth, the instinct to gag or even vomit came to the forefront of my mind. But surprisingly, it tasted very good. I had no trouble keeping it down. It had a slight aftertaste of bananas, and a sweetness and texture like honey mixed with phlegm. The texture was absolutely disgusting, however. It clove to my tongue, seeming to seep into my bloodstream instantly. I felt like I had drank a few cups of coffee within thirty seconds, and then time seemed to slow down. I felt my strength and speed increasing, and my mind worked at a frenetic pace, thinking of plans to escape.

I heard shuffling in the dark chamber. My hearing grew keener, until I could hear tiny mice shuffling in the walls. I could hear the eyeless man screaming in his castle through the nearby door in the wall, the shrieking of Golgaths as he burned their chitinous, shining shells with his fiery staff.

The Golgath larvae, as if threatened by my stealing of their secretions, began to swarm towards me, their lamprey-like teeth opening in unison. I saw it all happening in slow motion, a massive rush of adrenaline overtaking my body. With an agility and strength that seemed impossible, they began to spring, standing on their tails and pushing themselves up to launch themselves at me. Each of them hissed in unison, sounding like a den of disturbed snakes. The first one barely missed me by a fraction of an inch. I heard its tail slicing the air as it soared by my neck, its mouth opening and contracting, sucking like it could already taste the sweet blood of my jugular vein.

Time continued to slow down to a crawl. The hissing stretched out until it grew deep and long, sounding more like a whale call than a hiss in my altered state. I could feel the vibrations each slamming into my eardrum. Every second of time that passed felt like a minute, and I easily dodged dozens more of the larvae as they launched themselves up off of their powerful black tails. They slithered and skittered across the floor, hiding in dark places under the nearby desks and furniture.

The old man without eyes came running through the door at that moment. Even though his eyelids were stitched shut, he seemed to know exactly where he was going. He looked directly at me, if it were possible, and moved at a superhuman speed that made me realize he also likely had been eating these alien secretions. His reaction time was even faster than my own, and he was able to slam his thick wooden staff down on a larva that was rapidly flying through the air towards my left eye.

A rush of euphoria and exhilaration filled my body. I felt like I could run ten miles, do a thousand push-ups and still be filled with energy. This Golgath secretion truly was amazing stuff, I thought to myself. They should market it, add some of the phlegmy stuff to an energy drink. I wondered if the US government would allow alien mucus to be sold on the free market.

My thoughts were interrupted when I saw an entire group of the monstrous beasts approaching in an inverted-V shape. The two scouts slithered next to the walls to surround the eyeless man and myself, while dozens more followed behind them, cutting off any retreat in that direction. Their spacing reminded me of pictures of military parades. They were perfectly ordered, their soft movement all overlapping, their numbers spread out in evenly spaced formations. The eyeless man groaned, putting his head in his hand for a moment.

“OK, kid,” he said to me, looking over in his eerie way. His scarred face looked lined with worry and terror. “We need to get back to my castle. I have a plan.” He pushed me hard towards the door with the eye dripping blood. 

I saw the Golgaths closing in on us and sprinted as fast as I could. With the slowing down of time as a result of the drugs in the Golgath secretion, it felt like I was flying. My feet barely touched the floor, my sneakers pounding silently on the solid stone. Just as I got within a few feet of the door, so did the leading Golgath scout on that side of the chamber wall. It hissed at me, shrieking an inhuman battle cry as it lunged. Its thickly-muscled tail propelled it forward at an astonishing rate. Even with time slowed down, I saw only a black, shining blur. The secretion saved my life, though. Time was slowed down enough to where I could see its trajectory, and I ducked.

The eyeless man behind me didn’t fare so well. The Golgath missed me by fractions of an inch, its rancid stench like sickness and copper and iron mixing in the air as it flew over my small body. It landed on the eyeless man, its tentacles flying out and immediately ripping into his chest, his arms, his face. His wooden staff flew out of his hand and went rolling towards me. I took out my dagger and, with all of my childish strength and adrenaline, shoved the blade into the creature’s eye.

It shrieked, black blood running down the dagger’s length and covering my hand. Pulling back, it nearly yanked the blade out of my hand, but I held on, digging my heels in against the stones. Its tentacles retracted into its head. Its snake-like body writhed and shuddered, then retreated back towards the group of the creatures. Its cries made my ears ring, their deafening wail ringing off of every stone and echoing over and over. It felt like it would never end.

The rest of the creatures were only a few seconds away, circling around me and the eyeless man and closing in. I saw him crawling towards the door, leaving drops of blood on the cold stone floor. Grabbing his arm, I flung the door open and dragged him through, slamming it shut. The creatures ran into it, shaking the frame.

The eyeless man looked like he was dying. Part of his face had been ripped apart, his left cheek split in half so that I could see his teeth through the wound. His neck and chest pumped bright red spurts of arterial blood. They flowed out of his body, soaking his robes and the floor beneath him. He grabbed me with one hand, his grip still surprisingly strong.

“You have to get out of here,” he said to me. “You have to go home. Back to the mansion.” He coughed, spitting out bloody sputum onto the castle floor.

“How do you know about the mansion?” I asked, surprised. 

“I *made* that doorway for your grandfather,” he said. “He had heard of the Golgath secretions, and he paid me for a connection to Golgotha. Back then, I was young, just a poor, stupid occult practitioner. The secretions made me strong, increased my powers… but I was attacked the first night after opening the gateway to this place. One of them ripped out my eyes.

“I don’t have much time left. There are more coming, and they will break down that door. You have only seen the male Golgaths. They must look nearly indestructible to you, but they’re nothing compared to the female ones. And the cries of the males and the larvae in the nests *will* call a female over. They’re much stronger, older… much bigger. Maybe four times taller than the males, and nearly impossible to kill. The males are just workers and soldiers for the queen. Breeding stock, too. The females bite the heads off the males when they breed. And the one who took my eyes… she was a queen. I barely got out alive. Their tentacles are as thick as tree branches, and so fast that you can’t see them coming, even with high doses of the secretions.” He coughed again.

“Their weakness is fire. If you have to, light the entire goddamned place on fire. My staff will work. Just swing it and think of fire, fire, nothing but fire. It will respond. Get out of here alive at any cost.” At that moment, the door stopped rattling. It was as if all of the monsters had gone away at once. A sinking feeling in my stomach told me that they hadn’t gone far- likely to regroup, or maybe to join a female for the final attack. I looked at the door, then looked down at the man. He was unconscious now, still bleeding too fast. His eyes fluttered for a second, opening and closing rapidly as they rolled back in his head. I knew he didn’t have much time left.

Holding my dagger out in front of me, I carefully opened the door a crack and peered through. The Golgaths all appeared to be gone. Leaving the man who had saved my life for dead, knowing that I couldn’t help him anyway, I ran through, grabbing his staff. The secretions were still working on me, getting stronger even, and my senses were attuned, cranked up to the highest possible setting. I could smell and hear something massive coming down the chamber long before I saw it through all of the shadows and darkness. I quickly tucked the dagger into my belt.

I swung the staff, thinking of flames like the eyeless man told me, and lit a nearby desk covered with ancient, dry papers on fire. Then I moved to the Golgath nest. The staff set the shredded paper and mucus-like secretions on fire instantly. The secretions went up like gasoline, emitting nearly invisible blue flames. The larvae hissed and popped as the flames spread.

Smoke was filling the chamber, and flickering light now illuminated the dark corners. A few hundred feet away, I saw an eldritch monstrosity whose head nearly touched the stone ceilings of this cursed place. It must have stood at least twenty feet tall. Its head was much more sleek and stream-lined than the regular monsters, its nose holes flaring as it sniffed the air. Then it looked down at me. Behind it, I saw the male Golgaths gathered, circling around their queen, hissing and wailing in unison. I saw death closing in all around me.

I ran towards the door back to my world, the damned door with the robin that had started this entire mess in the first place. I kept lighting everything I could along the way, ramming the staff left and right and leaving trails of fire to spread behind me. The steps of the queen shook the floor, sounding like an approaching earthquake. I tried the knob again, but it was still locked. From the other side, however, I heard pounding. The voices of my father and uncle carried through, and it sounded like they were trying to smash the wooden door with some sort of instrument.

“A little late for a rescue party,” I muttered to myself, turning to face the horde of monsters that now stood only twenty feet away, closing in fast on me from all sides. The queen looked ancient, and from her nose and mouth, I saw filaments of what looked like white mold growing. She stopped, sneezing and coughing in a horrible, grating way. Her phlegm shot out and sprayed me and the surrounding desks and tables with the sickness. It smelled putrid, reminding me of rotting garbage. The mix of that rancid stench with the coppery, alien smell of the Golgath horde made me gag.

Looking down, I saw with horror that thousands of tiny white worms writhed inside that mucus. They were covering my face and clothes. I nearly dropped the staff as I screamed, trying to brush them off of my nose and mouth. I retched, but there was no time. The queen shook her head, then with a roar, charged straight at me.

At that moment, my uncle and father succeeded in breaking through part of the door, the bronze handle flying off and rolling in front of my feet. As if in slow motion, I felt hands grabbing at the back of my shirt. I used the staff like a baseball bat, smashing it down on the first massive tentacle of the queen that tried to snap at me. Blue flames shot out, and she shrieked, retracting it away from me.

I was pulled back through the door. My father slammed the remnants of it shut just as the monsters rammed into it. Smoke was pouring into the mansion, and I saw the door catching fire as well. The carpet started to burn, spreading the flames deeper into the huge structure.

“We have to get out of here!” my father screamed at me. “Come on, William! Run!” Dropping the staff, I ran. The weakened door, now missing a handle, flew open as the male Golgaths rushed out of the fire. My uncle had a shotgun in his hands, an insane grin on his face. His eyes sparkled. It was as if he knew his nightmares would soon be over.

“I’ll hold them off. Go!” Uncle Lawrence said, his voice sounding both excited and scared. I didn’t look back. I dropped the staff and bolted, running down the seemingly endless hallway of the mansion, pounding down the steps and out the front door.

My mother was waiting outside, wrapped in a shawl and shivering in the night air. She grabbed me and hugged me tightly. My father sprinted out a few seconds later. As we watched the top levels of the mansion burn, we kept waiting for Uncle Lawrence to come out. He never did.

Eventually, the fire department showed up along with police and ambulances. They looked at my strange, circular injuries where the Golgath tentacles had ripped my flesh and sucked out some of my blood, asking me how this could have happened. I shrugged.

“Leeches,” I said. They didn’t ask me any more questions about the injuries.

I later found out I had been missing for over three days, even though in Golgotha, it had only been a few hours. The police had been searching for me, but I think my uncle and father knew I had never left the mansion.

Crews going through the wreckage found multiple bodies, all with strange circular injuries. The bodies were all drained of blood, although the fire made it hard to recognize how they were sustained. Rumors began to circulate that my uncle was some sort of serial killer who drained the blood from his victims. Of course, I knew differently. Those were victims of the Golgaths. Some of them may have not even been from our world. I don’t know how they ended up in the mansion, though. Perhaps some of the victims were still alive in the endless chamber when I set it ablaze and ran out. There were endless miles of secret places I hadn’t explored, and countless doorways to other worlds there as well.

Nearly twenty years have passed since my experience in the mansion. The secretion mostly wore off after a day, but I seemed permanently affected in some ways. I could run faster and longer than before, and my memory became nearly photographic. My creativity also grew, and I became a published writer.

Over time, I fell in love, married and now, my wife is pregnant with our first child. I am excited for what is to come.

But the doctors who did the ultrasound say they’ve found one unusual thing.

The fetus seems to have extra fingers.
