They always say not to look in the backseat.  
I did.

I don’t remember deciding to. One moment I was driving, watching the tunnel lights slide by in that dull, hypnotic way they do, and the next I was checking the mirror like my body had done it before my brain caught up. The car kept moving—straight, steady—but something shifted. Like I stayed behind while something else leaned forward and took the wheel.

There wasn’t panic. Not at first.  
No sharp fear.  
Just this hollow calm. The kind you get when you zone out on the highway and suddenly realize you don’t remember the last few minutes.

Most people say they hear the car before anything else.  
I didn’t.

I saw him first.

Sockie was sitting in the backseat.

He looked like a kid. Blond hair falling forward, covering one eye. A bandage was wrapped across his face, too tight and uneven, like someone had rushed it and never bothered fixing it. His hands rested neatly in his lap. He wasn’t slouched. He wasn’t tense. He didn’t look at me.

He just stared straight ahead.

Not at the road. Not at the tunnel walls. Just forward—like he already knew where the car was going and didn’t need to watch it happen.

The engine sound came late. Low. Wrong. Like it was lagging behind everything else. The headlights didn’t bounce when the road dipped. They didn’t react to the curves. When the tunnel lights brightened, the glow felt delayed, like time snapped back into place a second too late.

I told myself it was stress.  
Or exhaustion.  
Or the lights messing with my eyes.

Anything that let me keep breathing.

I tried to slow down.

My foot lifted off the brake on its own.

My hands stayed on the wheel, but when I tried to turn it, nothing happened. The car kept rolling like it had already decided what it wanted to do. My heart was pounding so hard I thought I might pass out, but my throat locked up. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t even swear.

In the mirror, his head tilted slightly.

The bandage shifted.

I saw his eyes.

They were blue. Too blue. Not bright—empty. And they didn’t move the way eyes should. They didn’t track. They didn’t blink. They just… were.

The moment I stopped fighting it, everything settled. Not calm. Not safe. Just quiet. Like my body finally gave up the argument.

The car kept driving.

I stopped using the tunnel after that. Took longer routes. Left earlier. Made excuses. I told myself that if I didn’t go back, whatever I’d seen would shrink into a bad memory I could laugh about later.

It didn’t.

At first it was small things. Catching my reflection in shop windows and thinking someone was sitting behind me. Seeing movement in the mirror at red lights and forcing myself not to look. The radio cutting out mid-song, sharp and sudden, like someone had turned the volume all the way down.

Then came the headaches. Deep ones. Not pain, exactly—pressure. Like something sitting just behind my eyes, waiting. People at work asked if I was okay. I smiled too hard and said yes because I didn’t know how to explain that sometimes my body didn’t feel completely mine anymore.

Driving became the worst part.

Sometimes my foot hovered over the brake without me meaning to. Sometimes the steering went light, then heavy, like the car needed a second to decide what it was doing. I started timing my drives and realizing I couldn’t remember parts of them. Turns vanished. Streets blurred together.

Once, I pulled into my driveway and sat there with the engine still running because I couldn’t remember the last mile at all.

I don’t drive with music anymore.  
I don’t drive tired.  
I don’t drive angry.

Both hands on the wheel. Eyes straight ahead. Every rule people swear will keep you safe.

Still, there are moments when the road goes quiet and the car feels too steady. When the speed settles into a number I didn’t choose. When the steering stops needing me.

In those moments, I understand something I wish I didn’t.

They say not to look in the backseat.

I don’t.

But it was never about looking.

It’s about the drive lining up just right.  
About the car remembering.  
About arriving.

And somewhere out there, I know a backseat is already occupied—

waiting for me to catch up.
