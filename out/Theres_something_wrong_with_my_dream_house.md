I clicked the pen in my hand nervously, waiting for the real estate agent to finish her review of the stack of papers between us. My hands were damp and cold, leaving condensation patches on the black desk in the office we sat in. I swiped them away as discreetly as I could.

The room itself was musky and smelled too much like whatever my agent must have doused herself in that morning, but there was something else too. Something I couldn’t quite name that vaguely reminded me of eggs and dirt.

The office was gorgeous yet bizarrely antiquated. The ceiling, walls, and floor were made from wood so dark it looked black. Oddly, everything in the room was made of wood, and that meant literally everything. Strange-looking boxes littered the wooden shelves along with figurines, blocks, and a large dream catcher made entirely of wood. Surprisingly, even the pen in my cold hand was sleek and wooden with just the smallest metal nib.

It was a stark difference from the outside of the office space they must rent from, which was as nondescript as they came.

The building was a large gray concrete monstrosity that housed hundreds of small office rooms. Walking to find hers had filled me with a sense of dread so strong that I felt weak. 

In the back of my mind I began to question if I would ever make it there or end up lost in the seemingly unending maze of doors and hallways. I had the feeling of being watched and at one point thought I heard the sound of carnival music along with someone laughing.

⸻

It was my first time in her office. We normally met at either the new home or at local coffee shops around the area. My agent herself was also a bit odd, but I couldn’t really place why. At first I thought it was due to the age difference, she was quite old and a bit eccentric, maybe in her late 60s to early 70s if I had to guess.

I had found out about her firm from a now ex-coworker. We weren’t close, but she was subject to my complaints over my roommates, landlord, and horrible apartment complex I’d been living in since I graduated eight years ago. A few months back, after the third apartment microwave fire that week, she turned to me in our office and asked why I hadn’t “just” moved out yet. I didn’t really have an answer other than the standard: I had some money saved, but not enough for anything nice.

She told me she knew of a friend of a friend who had gone through a real estate agency working on foreclosed homes at a steal. My interest was immediately piqued.

Angor Real Estate was the name. When I got home that night and searched for it, I found next to nothing other than a single page. It was a website with just an address and a phone number, and it looked like something made in Microsoft Word.

At the time, to be honest, I thought it was odd, but not odd enough to pass down a potential life-changing move. I called the number, elegantly typed in Times New Roman, and a sultry voice answered immediately on the first ring.

“This is Angor, where we bring your dreams at a fraction of the cost!”

I was peppered with standard questions like my income (which was okay), credit (slightly less than okay), and family living situation (definitely less than okay, seeing as I was an only child with no immediate family around or a partner).

After thirty or so minutes followed by a few stranger questions- 

“Do you consider yourself to be superstitious?” 
“What are your religious beliefs?” 
“Are you imaginative?”

I was then given an address for a home, shockingly in my budget and only an hour away.
⸻

Currently, as I sat at the desk, my agents eyes were flickering along one of the contracts as she chewed on what looked to be a stick. Id had a terrible nightmare the night prior and felt a shuddering sense of déjà vu watching her.

She was a statuesque woman. She had to be over six feet tall and she inadvertently leaned over me  even while seated with a wiry, bony frame. She looked like she could snap in half at any moment yet somehow seemed unbreakable.

Her skin was coarse and haggard but always had a thick smear of foundation plastered haphazardly across it. She had a nose that was two sizes too small, which led to her mouth appearing too low in comparison to her other features, nearly hanging off. And her mouth was another thing. Her mouth was too big for her face and painted in an always-smeared ruby red lipstick. The skin on her face not only sagged with age but looked like it had been stretched against her bones then relaxed loose.

As I continued anxiously watching her, she finally looked up at me with a subtle smirk.

“Well, congratulations are in order, Ms. Vigil! All signatures are completed and you can proudly say you are now a new homeowner!”

I smiled, finally feeling relieved.

“Thank you so much, Dunia. Am I still set for move-in next week?”

Dunia stared at me for a long moment before answering, her eyes seemingly moving from mine to my mouth. A smile cracked her face in half. Strings of spit were strewn across her gums. I unintentionally recoiled then immediately righted myself. 

“Oh yes, of course yes. Well, I should say yes, but I did receive a call from the city and, with this being a foreclosure and all, we’re actually able to get you in a bit sooner. Yes, of course much sooner, actually. You’re able to move in as soon as today, now that we have this pretty little print.” She pointed a long finger at one of my lopsided signatures on a page in front of us.

My heart picked up pace. I was never good with abrupt changes, always having things scheduled down to the minute. This news would have excited most, but it sent prickles of anxiety crawling through my chest. I again thought of my nightmare, and remembered something about the house and a field.

“Oh, well that’s… um, that’s great, but I just already have my movers scheduled out and I’m not sure how I—”

“Tsk tsk! Not a worry at all, dear, really no worry. I was able to call in some old favors I was due. Once I saw you pull into the lot I already made a few calls, so don’t fret. Don’t even dream about it. We have a pickup crew who’s just wondrous, truly fabulous. They’re waiting for you at home, you told me you’d been packed up since last week, so why continue to wait?”

I stared at her incredulously as she continued on.

“You had the name of your movers listed on one of the liability pages here, so I did you the liberty of canceling with them as well.” The smile was still glued to her face, yet somehow even wider. Red lipstick was now staining her teeth, making her look garish.

My jaw dropped as my mouth gaped in surprise. I could hear her breath whistling through her clenched red teeth and quickly clamped my jaw shut. 

I now tasted her musky, sulfurous breath on my tongue and started to feel sick.

This was not part of the plan. I was angry, shocked, and newly nauseous, but I was left with no choice as she got up from her squeaking chair and ushered me out of her room. My arms were promptly filled with loose papers and another copy of her agent card, on top of a single folder labeled “Previous Owner’s Additional Information.”

With a slight push I was out, and the door then shut behind me with a resounding thwack. The immediate sound of a lock being turned echoed down the unending corridor to both the left and right of me. I ambled my way out of the building feeling foggy and unsettled. 

This is not how I wanted to start my first day in my new home.

⸻

The rest of the afternoon was a complete and utter blur. I rushed back to my apartment to find a large moving truck with six bizarrely tall men outside. They could have been relatives, or maybe they were brothers and were related to Dunia. There was an eerie resemblance to her.

Their eyes watched me almost hungrily, but I swear one of them looked they were holding back a smile. My roommates were gone thankfully, but I felt a pang of guilt. Even though we weren’t close, I would have preferred to say bye.

Before I knew it, my apartment was devoid of all my things, albeit for the mouse droppings on the floor and my landlord’s eclectic posters he had plastered on the walls when I moved in.

None of the movers spoke, other than a few grunts here and there, and they loaded my furniture in quickly along with boxes. I kept getting whiffs of that same cloying scent from earlier and dread started to build in my gut.

There was a logo on the side of their moving truck: “Somnium Moving – We make moving feel like a dream!” 

The metal sliding door was shut just forty-five minutes later and we were off.

⸻

I anxiously began the drive, I had just enough gas to get there and an hour to spare. As I rode, uneasy thoughts began to fill my head and a sense of wrongness I couldn’t seem to shake hung over me. I rang one of my only friends to help fill the time as the ever growing sense of doom was surely going to climax if not. 

I picked up my phone.

Steve and I have known each other since we were in pre-K. Now, both of us at the age of thirty, had become closer than ever. He was the only person I’d ever trusted and had outlasted all the fleeting relationships I had made in my younger years.

On the last ring he finally answered.

“Pursie? You don’t usually call me until eight or nine on a Friday. Everything ok?” he asked.

“Hey, yeah, I’m all good. Well, sort of all good. I’m actually on my way to the house. It’s a long story.” I groaned on the last syllable. Damn you, Dunia.

Steve perked up immediately. “Dude, what?! I thought next week. This whole things been kind of crazy I mean the house was fine but I’m surprised you’d go for it in the first place! It looks like my old house.”

I interrupted him in shock cutting off his next sentence. “What are you talking about? Your house was blue and had three floors Steve”

Steve laughed, “Yeah that’s what this house looks like but I mean I know you’ll paint it. You always gone for those gothic looking ones even as kids”

I scoffed. “Steve it’s literally an almost black house and it’s two floors. You saw it with me.”

Steve was silent for a second. 

“Yeah I don’t know Pursie, I don’t think i’m remembering it wrong. I only saw it for a few last I dropped you off but I guess we’ll see. I took the day off and everything to help you next week. Ok, I mean, I was going to call out regardless, but do you still need me to come by? Text me the address again. I can swing by tomorrow morning.”

I let out the breath I must have been holding since I left Dunia’s wooden nightmare of an office. “Yeah, please, honestly. I’ll text you the address when I get there.”

⸻

I hung up and placed my phone face-down in the cupholder. Odd he didn’t remember it right, I was sure I had gushed about it to him and he saw it in person. 

I let the thought linger as I stared out against the road. The highway signs blurred past me, green slabs of metal bending into each other like soft shapes. I kept thinking about Dunia, her voice echoing through my skull like it had left a print. Her lipstick smeared teeth gnashed in my head.  I could still smell her on my sweater-her scent failing to be masked by whatever perfume she had layered on so heavily. The déjà vu was growing stronger by the second, passing fields in my vision seemed to blur into one endless infinite stretch of green. I shook my head.

Move-in today. No choice. No plan. Just motion.

⸻

The sun was setting by the time I turned off the main road. The driveway stretched farther back than I remembered, almost like fresh pavement had unrolled itself just for me. Long spindly trees lined each side like silent guards. A factor I had first found charming but now found to be oppressive in my state of paranoia.

Their branches arched overhead in a way that felt intentional, a tunnel guiding me toward something I couldn’t name.

The house stood there at the end of the tree tunnel. It looked how I remembered, a deep brown black exterior. There was ivy that crawled along the second floor windows and the roof was hatched. It was a mix between a cottage and gothic style exterior. 

I parked.

The movers’ truck was already there, parked at an angle in the gravel pull-in. All six of the tall, gaunt men stood in a line by the open back doors. Their silhouettes looked elongated by the fading light, like shadows pretending to be people. From the corner of my eye I thought I saw a split of white teeth on one of them. I blinked and looked back but no faces had changed. I shook my head and shut my car off.

One of them gave me a stiff nod, then turned toward the house.

That was when I saw the door.

It was already open.

No one had keys other than myself. I hadn’t even stepped inside yet. But the front door was swung wide like the house had been waiting for me specifically, like it knew I was coming long before Dunia signed anything.

I swallowed hard and grabbed my purse after slipping my phone in my pocket.

Inside, the house was brighter than it should’ve been. The windows let in a kind of fading gold glow that seemed too soft to be real. And the rooms, God, the rooms, looked beautiful. Dark wood floors, tall ceilings, and painted wood grain walls washed in evening light. Clean. Whisper-quiet. Peaceful.

I instantly felt at ease, and the brunt of the day started to soak into my body. The movers began coming in and out, unloading boxes and arranging furniture all with a mind of their own. Eerily, I didn’t have to tell them what would go where and they didn’t ask. After bringing the first piece out they just seemed to know what fit in each room. 

The house was two floors with a basement, honestly much more than I needed but this was to be my forever place. It looked so similar to a dollhouse I used to have when I was younger. It’s part of the reason why I fell in love with it so soon. 

 I reached for my phone to text Steve, wanting to tell him about the strangeness of the situation with the movers and the success of getting there but my hand fell flat across my pocket. I’d left my phone in the car.

⸻

I sighed audibly and went back outside to my car. I was tired to my bones, feeling so drained and out of sorts. I climbed into the front seat and sat for a moment, watching the men go in and out of the house. I counted them, trying to distinguish them from one another, and failed.

Suddenly my eyelids felt like they were being weighed down with cinder blocks. I yawned, covering my mouth. The car was so warm (but my car’s off). It smelled like wood (but didn’t it smell like sulfur?). I started to feel my legs get heavy. Lifting them to get out of the car was impossible.

My gaze lazily wandered over to the movers again. Oh wow, they’re all moving so fast. That’s One, and that’s number Two, out comes Four. No, Four just went to the truck. Or was that number Six? Maybe it was One again. Are there six of them? I swear I just… I saw seven. How are they moving so fast… There’s number Five. I swear he’s staring at me… She needs to fix her lipstick. He needs to fix his lipstick? 

My breathing had slowed considerably. I tried to unbuckle my seatbelt (when did I put my seatbelt on?) but my arms felt useless and weak. I gave up, and as my arms fell back to my sides, my hand brushed my pants and there I felt it. 

My phone in my pocket. 

A moment of alarm cut through the haze. I tried to gasp but my lungs were filled with the stink of rot instead of air. When I looked back up, sleep was overcoming my body- but why were all of the movers staring at me and smiling?  Why did their smiles look so wide? My fears were rapidly disregarded as my eyes closed and I drifted into sleep.

⸻

I woke up with a start. I felt constrained and tried to jump up, not knowing where I was, but was halted by an arm pulling tightly across my chest. A scream ripped out of my lungs and I flailed, twisting and turning until I was awake enough to realize I was in my car and it was dark. 

My seatbelt, not an arm, had done its job, thinking I was in an accident and stopping me from getting ripped out  of the car.

“What the fuck?” I said out loud. 

I never fell asleep in the middle of the day, let alone at a new house surrounded by movers. It was dark as sin out, and immediately I felt a chill drift through the car. I looked around, but the windows were closed and the car was still off.

I unbuckled myself and was about to exit until I remembered the stack of papers on the seat. I peeked over and saw the manila folder from earlier. Now was as good a time as ever. I opened it to find just one single sheet titled “Basement.”

My stomach twisted in anticipation as I began to read.

Basement:

Be careful going into the basement. There are numerous entrances and exits. You will find yourself getting lost. You won’t believe it, but it will happen. I tried to destroy it, but it didn’t work. It won’t let you. It’s bigger than it seems. It’s not what it seems. If something is too good to be true there’s a reason for it. Steel your mind, you’ve been here before. No matter what don’t fall asleep down there.


⸻

A laugh bubbled out of my lips. I started laughing harder and before I knew it I was having an actual laughing fit. For the first time all day I felt a sense of relief. My laughter stopped after a short minute then shook my head. 

I had seen the basement already during one of my tours and it was more of a hole than a “basement”. The house had been around since the 1800s and the basement was used basically as a refrigerator. It was somewhat finished with walls, a floor, and a ceiling but was no bigger than a walk-in closet.

This had to be some type of joke or the last owner was just a little senile.

I gathered myself, then opened the door to the car. I checked the time, 1:08 am. Wonderful.

I began walking up to the house when I felt it. Someone was watching me. I spun around quickly and felt a hitch in my breath.

“Hello?” I squeaked out. My throat was tight.

There was no returning answer, yet the sensation of being watched only increased. All of a sudden I was surrounded by the sound of echoing small claps, a scream tore from my lips and my heart skipped harshly. I spun around wildly and was met with a gust of fierce wind. My eyes skipped around me and in the dark I realized it was just the trees with their spindly branches being shaken violently by the gust.

My heart only then resumed its normal
pattern. I turned to face the house agin. That’s when I noticed the front door was wide open again.

Unfuckingbelievable. The movers left the door open. That’s what happens when you get stuck with some out-of-nowhere crew, I guess. After a few more seconds of waiting, I grabbed my phone and turned the flashlight on. I was debating calling the police and having them come in for a walk-around when I checked my bars and gasped. I had zero reception.

I ground my teeth angrily, gnashing them against each other. 

Of course, Purcilla. Of course this happens, I thought to myself. I remembered then that Dunia had mentioned there being poor service, but inside the house the reception had some solid spots.

Looks like I was going inside at this point regardless.

I crossed the threshold of the door and immediately knew something was off. 

⸻

It was too quiet. Earlier there had been footsteps, movement, weight shifting over floorboards, the low thud of furniture against walls. Now the house was still. Completely still, like sound had been swallowed whole.

My flashlight grazed across the entryway. Furniture was there, everything placed more perfectly than I could have done myself. But something felt wrong. I couldn’t articulate it, but the air tasted thick and cold like morning breath against winter. I breathed in deeply. Sulfur coated my throat. I gagged once and almost turned back, but I needed that damn signal.

I forced myself to walk farther inside.

My steps sounded like gunshots against the wood paneling. The movers had left all the lights off and I fumbled for the switch. Issue was I couldn’t see. 

That was when I noticed the glow.

A faint light was spilling up from the basement door.

The basement that was too small to matter. The one I had already seen. The one the note told me not to fall asleep in.

My stomach dropped.

⸻


I told myself I was only going to check that everything was fine. The movers must have turned on a light and forgotten it. Nothing supernatural. Nothing strange. Just bad service and a weird day catching up to me. My head felt cloudy and hazy, like the worst case of brain fog I’d had in my life.

I should have turned around.
I should have left.
I didn’t.

The wooden door was cracked open by an inch. I nudged it with the toe of my shoe and it drifted open wider, slow and smooth like it had been waiting.

I felt my heart shake my chest with each beat. The silence was almost too loud. My chest grew tighter with each passing second. I began my descent.

The basement stairs creaked under my weight.

One.
Two.
Three.

On the sixth step I realized the basement wasn’t the same size anymore. My hand shook and the light from my phone wildly moved along the walls.

I stopped breathing.

Where there should have been a short wall and an unfinished concrete floor, there was space. Endless space. A field, lush and green, stretching out under my house like an inverted sky. The ceiling above me looked impossibly high, like clouds hung where beams should have been. I lunged to go back up the stairs, but there was no door at the top anymore, just a seamless wooden partition. I yelped and jumped, and that’s when I tripped.

I felt myself falling for six breaths, which wouldn’t be possible except it was. I braced for impact excruciatingly slowly, yet it didn’t happen. My shoes landed on soft earth instead of the hard concrete I expected to meet with my face.

The basement was gone.

In its place, stretching endlessly under the house like space inverted, was one of the fields from my nightmare. Or it looked just like it. Only this time, it was real. I could smell it, sweet grass and distant rain. I could feel it, warm wind lifting strands of my hair. I could hear it, a low hum like the earth itself was thinking.

My fear alarmingly evaporated like mist.

And something inside me whispered, “It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” and I agreed.

⸻

A swing set appeared ahead of me. Rusted chains, sun-bleached wood, but it swayed even without wind, as if it remembered being played on. When I blinked, it shimmered and changed, becoming the swing from my childhood home. My mother pushing me. Her laughter real enough that I could almost touch it.

My imagination was leaking into reality. I was going crazy. This couldn’t be real yet—

“This world listens.” The words entered my mind abruptly.

An odd sense of glee took over. I felt myself giving in to my hysteria. I thought of a theme park, and rides surged into existence. Rollercoasters glittered like chrome serpents. The smell of popcorn burned my nostrils. A carousel spun with painted horses whose eyes gleamed wet like something alive. Voices rose, distant cheers, childhood shrieks of joy, music that felt familiar enough to hurt.

I walked forward without thinking,  smiling, until I noticed something wrong.

I looked again at the  blurring people around me. Those who were there yet not there, like dreamy visions. The faces on the riders weren’t faces.

Just wide mouths. Too wide. Smiling. Always smiling. No eyes. Only teeth like polished bone. And on those teeth were the faintest smudges of red.

My pulse surged.

I took a step back, and the field moved with me like it didn’t want me to leave. Grass wound around my ankles, soft at first then tight enough to bruise. The music grew dissonant. The smell of popcorn went sour. And the laughter turned into groans. 

I stumbled, and as I fell, reality shifted and it slid, revealing a wooden square hatch on the grass below my feet.

The metal latch clicked on its own. Once. Twice. Then swung open.

Darkness yawned beneath it.

I should have run, but I was suspended, falling again. A sense of morbid curiosity overrode terror the way hunger overrides reason. I leaned in. Something glowed far below, a pulsing red light like a heartbeat inside the earth.

And that’s when I fell through.

The hatch swallowed me whole.

No sensation. No falling. Just a sudden stop and the crack of bone against stone. Pain blossomed in my skull like a slow-blooming bruise. My vision blurred at the edges. Then everything went white.

⸻

I woke in the grass.

Not lying, but standing, as if my body had risen without me.

The field was darker now. The sky black and glossy like oil. The moon hung too close, swollen and veined like an eye that watched without blinking. 

Dread clutched my heart. I tried to empty my mind, I was understanding far too late that my emotions and desires seemed to influence what was around me but it was too late. 

I saw it.

Far at first. A silhouette. Tall. Thin. Wrong. Spindly arms and too many fingers. It was neither male nor female. It looked like a horrible cross between a willow tree and a human, gone horrifically wrong. Wood overlayed with parts of human skin.

Then I smelled it.

Pure sulfur. I retched and heaved as the scent invaded every aspect of my senses.

My eyes were streaming. With every blink it was closer. One moment distant. The next ten feet away. Then five. Then one.

It didn’t walk. It just arrived.

Its  face was human only in the vaguest way. Teeth long enough to scrape its lower jaw. They were stained red, not lipstick but blood. A grin so wide it split it’s cheeks into raw red fissures. Moss grew through chunks of sinewy flesh and twig growths in bands of muscle. Eyes black and swirling like liquid night.

It’s  voice wasn’t spoken. It bloomed inside me, pressing against the edges of my mind like something trying to hatch through bone.

Pain feeds me.
Wonder feeds you.
We are mirrors.
We are one.

My legs locked. A white-hot ache shot through them like molten metal filling bone. I crumpled, screaming through clenched teeth as grass wove itself around my calves like tendrils growing from the earth. 

Every breath was agony as that rotting smell seemed to permeate my lungs.

It bent down, face inches from mine, smile stretching impossibly wider.

You imagined me.
You made me.
Every owner does.

My vision flickered.

Faces surrounded it. Hundreds. Thousands. All identical. All smiling. Stacked like reflections in infinite mirrors. Men. Women. Children. All this other, this wrongness, each one another layer of the same nightmare.

And then—

I saw my own face among them.

Grinning. Sharp-toothed. Hollow-eyed.

I wasn’t in the field anymore.

I was dreaming on the basement floor.

Blood pooling beneath my head.

Unconscious.

Everything, the field, the rides, the smiles, was happening behind my closed eyelids like a parasite weaving memories through my brain.

But one detail chilled my spine:

My reflection in the smiling crowd was the only one that had red stained teeth.

Other Purcilla reached toward me from inside the field like a second version of myself pulling at the edges of my consciousness.

You fell. You dreamed.
Now we will finish what your mind began.

I woke screaming in the real world, sprawled in the basement dirt, heart hammering like it was trying to escape. It was over, a nightmare. I was still in the house- I had fallen and passed out but I was okay.

Only one thing was different.

In my mouth,
wedged between my teeth,
was a small stick. 

I pulled it out with a shaking hand and it made a shlurping pop. Wet. Fresh. Tinged with my own blood.

From a field that shouldn’t exist.

And just as I staggered to my feet, I heard footsteps upstairs.

Slow. Heavy.

One.
Then another.
And another.

Too many to count.

All smiling.
All waiting.
All the same other.

And one voice, my own voice, echoed down the stairs, soft and cruel:

You thought it was the house’s dream.
It was yours.
And now I’m awake. 
And here you will dream.
