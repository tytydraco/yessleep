I checked myself into the stress center after many hours on third shift. I hadn’t been sleeping. My hands would shake when I poured coffee. I cried in the breakroom over a missing stapler. Something was unraveling.

They took me in without much resistance. The intake nurse smiled too much, like she had practiced it in the mirror. She said I’d be safe here. She said I needed rest. Her eyes didn’t match her voice.

The first two days were a fog. I remember the needle. I remember dreaming about a hallway that stretched longer the more I ran down it. When I woke up, everything looked normal, but it felt wrong.

The staff were cheerful. Always smiling. Always upbeat. But they didn’t move like real people. Their words came too slowly, like lines in a play. One nurse dropped a cup and then froze before saying "oops." A few hours later, I saw her do it again. Same spot. Same "oops."

Patients weren’t much better. They’d sit at the tables and murmur things to each other, too quiet for me to hear. But they all looked at me. Like I was the guest of honor at a party I didn’t want to attend.

I tried to brush it off. Stress. Sleep deprivation. Psych meds. Maybe I needed to be here after all.

But then the nights came.

I don’t know what they were giving me. The pills looked standard enough. One white, one pink. Sometimes a dissolvable one they’d drop on my tongue while smiling. But they did something to my head. At night I’d lay in my bed and feel like I was falling through the mattress. Voices would whisper over each other just behind the wall. Sometimes it sounded like my name. Sometimes it was sobbing. Once it was my mother’s voice saying, you should not have come here.

I’d wake up paralyzed, drenched in sweat, my heart hammering in my ears. A figure would be in the corner of the room. Motionless. Watching. When I blinked it would be gone. But I swear I still felt its breath.

During the day, things got worse.

The patients and staff spoke in code. At first it was harmless. They’d say things like “clock’s ticking” or “don’t miss the train” in the middle of group therapy. But then it started getting personal.

One afternoon, a woman named Cheryl began sharing in group. She said she’d been working third shift. She said she’d started crying over small things. She said she couldn’t stop thinking about that screen name she used online, the one from the forum. A very obscure forum on the deep web that not many people know about. 

I sat frozen. I never told anyone that.

She looked right at me and smiled.

Later, in the hallway, I heard a staff member say, “She hasnt caught on at all.” They laughed. I didn’t.

Then came the visit from my parents.

They brought their pastor with them. He was all calm words and hollow eyes. He gave me a Bible and said, “I feel the Lord has imoressed on my heart to tell you to meditate on Psalm 91. Particularly 1-4. Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.” Surely he will save you from the fowler’s snare and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge." 

He slipped me a paper with these verses written down.

That night, I felt poisoned. Not metaphorically. My skin itched from the inside. My speech slurred like I’d been drinking. I stumbled to the nurse's office and begged for help. They let me in. Then they locked the door.

I sat down. One of them giggled.

“She's all drugged out,” one whispered. They passed a clipboard back and forth like it was a joke.

I tried to focus. Tried to keep my eyes from rolling. And that’s when I saw the bookshelf in the corner. Right at eye level.

The title read: “The Fowler.”

Something inside me snapped. I knew I was in enemy territory.

The next morning I had an appointment with the doctor.

I walked in, still foggy. He was an older African man. Dressed like royalty. Gold watch. Gold rings. Tailored suit. His accent was thick, his tone pleasant.

He asked me if I liked the dark web.

I blinked, confused. I hadn’t said a word yet.

“What?”

He smiled.

Then he recited my screen name. Not just the username. The one I use to log in.

Everything went black.

---


I woke up strapped to a gurney.

My arms were secured at the sides, legs bound tight. A heavy lead blanket pressed across my chest. My head wouldn’t turn. I could see only the ceiling. Tiles stained with water damage. Fluorescent light, flickering.

A high-pitched tone hummed just out of hearing range. The kind that makes your teeth itch.

Voices murmured behind a curtain. Not medical voices. Flat, toneless. As if people were reading from scripts with no understanding of what they meant.

“She initiated contact.”

“She’s drifted too far from the pattern.”

I tried to speak. Nothing came out. My tongue felt like cotton. My lips tingled like I had bitten through them in my sleep.

The curtain pulled back.

A man leaned over me. Not the African doctor. This one wore a surgical mask and a blue coat with no ID tag. His eyes looked... empty. Not dead, not malicious. Just gone.

He held something in his hand. A cable. It looked like it came from inside a computer, still slick at the end like it had just been pulled out.

He whispered, “Do not resist the tether.”

Then he pushed the cable against my forehead.

I don’t remember pain. I remember sound.

A static scream. A burst of radio noise layered with voices. My childhood voice counting. My father’s voice saying my name. My own voice, reading a sentence I once wrote in the dark web forum. Something awful. Something I forgot I had ever typed.

“Sometimes I wonder if I was born to be eaten.”

The sound cut. I gasped.

I was in my room again. Just like that.

The gurney was gone. The restraints. The man. All gone.

I sat on my bed in the ward. Morning light shone through the window, but the sun looked wrong. Flat and artificial, like it had been painted on glass.

I stumbled to group therapy.

The chairs were in a circle, but no one spoke. They all stared at me. Their faces were slack. Not angry. Not curious. Just watching.

One of the staff stood in the corner.

She said, “Let’s open today with gratitude. Who wants to thank the Fowler?”

I tried to leave. The door wouldn’t open.

They all began to speak at once. The words didn’t make sense, not at first. They weren’t answers. They were data. Lines from my life.

“My screen name in 2013 was C0daHeart.”

“She wrote about her sister’s accident but deleted it before posting.”

“She lied to her therapist about the pills.”

“She stole from the store in eighth grade. Her mother never found out.”

Each voice was my memory.

Each one hit like a needle under the fingernail.

Then a new voice joined in.

A man’s voice. Calm. Pleasant. Coming from the overhead speaker.

“Hello again.”

It was the African doctor.

“You’ve been using our network for a long time. Did you enjoy it? Did you feel clever, hiding behind pseudonyms? Did you think we weren't capable of intercepting your brains energetic signature?”

I covered my ears.

He continued, “You entered a ritual the moment you uploaded your confession. The moment your shame went public. We’ve been preparing you ever since.”

I screamed. The patients all turned to look at me. Still blank-faced. Still smiling.

Then they spoke together, like a choir made of static.

“Welcome to Phase Four.”

The door opened.

I ran.

The halls were wrong. Longer than they should be. Turned at angles that couldn’t exist. I passed a room with no number, but the sound behind it was unmistakable.. laughter mixed with screaming.

I turned a corner and saw something worse.

My parents.

Standing in the hallway, holding hands. Their faces were bruised. Lips moving silently. Their pastor stood behind them, reading from a book.

It was not a Bible.

The cover said “Reverse Psalms.”

I turned and ran back the other way.

The hallway curved sharply and led downward. The floor was at a slope, almost imperceptible at first, but it steepened the further I went. I passed doors with strange symbols instead of numbers. One looked like a stylized eye. Another was just a red thread nailed into the wall, coiled into a spiral.

The air got colder. My bare feet slapped the tile.

Finally, I reached a steel door, slightly ajar.

Inside: a control room.

There were no people. Just machines. Screens. Rows of them. Every screen showed a different patient room. Every angle. Even the bathrooms. Even my room.

In the far corner, a large monitor displayed something worse.

A 3D rendering of my body.

Pulsing veins. Neural currents mapped in blue. Overlaid with language I couldn’t understand. A readout blinked: “SIGNAL STABILITY: 88% // ASCENSION PATHWAY: DIVERGENT.”

I stepped closer.

Beneath the display was a list. Names. All usernames.

The first few I recognized from the forum. Names of people who vanished. One of them had once messaged me to say they were going offline for a while because “something was following them in the code.”

My name was the last on the list.

Beside it, two columns. One marked Initiated, already lit. The second column was dark. It said: Harvest Window: Pending Approval.

Behind me, a door clicked shut.

I turned. A nurse stood there. The same one who handed me the drink on my first day. This time, no smile. No mask.

She said nothing.

She walked to the far wall, opened a hidden panel, and pulled out a metal case. From it, she removed a small object. A coin, or something like it. Flat, black, etched with the same spiral I’d seen outside.

She held it out to me.

“You can still be useful,” she said.

I didn’t take it.

“What is this?” I asked.

Her voice dropped, almost human.

“It’s a key. Not to escape. That’s not part of this anymore. It’s a key to choose how you’re used.”

I shook my head.

She smiled again, but this time it reached her eyes. There was something ancient in them. Tired. Starving.

“You don’t understand yet. You weren’t brought here to be cured.”

She dropped the coin into my palm and closed my fingers around it.

“Phase Five begins tonight. If you’re still lucid by then, you’ll have a choice.”

She turned and walked out.

The lights in the room dimmed.

The main screen blinked once, then shifted.

A live feed.

Of me.

In the control room.

Standing exactly as I was.

But I wasn’t alone in the footage.

Behind me, something was moving.

Slow.

Tall.

Hands covered in gauze.

And no reflection on the screen.

To be continued...
