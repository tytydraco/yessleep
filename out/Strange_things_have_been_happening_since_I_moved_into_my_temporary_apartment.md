I moved into the new apartment with my family three weeks back and strange things that I can’t explain has been happening.  


A little background on the new apartment, my parents won it in an auction and it didn’t go for very much since the two previous owners died inside. We only bought this apartment for an investment opportunity however our house pipes exploded and the bottom half of the house flooded and we had to Move in while we got it fixed. My dad is a builder while my mum is an interior designer however they both have a side business of renting out houses and apartments. This is the third house they bought other than what we live in that they are planing to rent out. We already have a house and another apartment that is being rented out. So when the pipes exploded we had no where else to go. if anyone has questions about it they can ask for more info.  


I have never believed in paranormal activity but I also haven’t not believed in it if that makes sense. We moved into this house as my presents were still reinventing, so some parts of the apartment aren’t working. One of the the places that were being reinvented was the guest bathroom and it hasn’t been used in ages however on the first night in the apartment I couldn’t sleep as I kept hearing water dropping, I decided I couldn’t ignore it so I decided to check it out. The sound was coming from the guest bathroom and the closer I got the louder it seemed to get. I went inside and there was no water and sounds of water dripping disappeared but when I went back outside the sound came back. At this point I decided I wasn’t going to go to sleep and I watched tv all night till I crashed in the morning. When I told my mum she shrugged it off and declared it that I was just an uneasy of a new environment.  


The next incident was a week after and in daytime. I was home alone with my baby sister as my parents took my younger brother to his tennis comps which they stay to watch. I was in the living room watching tv and my sister was in her cot and I had a baby monitor so I could keep an eyes on her while she naps however I started to hear her crying through the monitor but since we live in an apartment if she was crying I would hear her not just only through the monitor. When I went to look at the image through the monitor I saw my sister fast asleep so I don’t know who I heard crying through the monitor and then later I heard it again but she was still fast asleep.  


The last incident was two days ago and the weirdest. I was home alone on a stormy night but with a friend this time and let’s say me and him were doing more then just watching tv, however the tv was on in the background but at some point it turned off, I just thought it was an internet problem until my mum texted me that there was a blackout as lighting had hit the main power point and that they wouldn’t be abLe to come home till the lights were back in as no traffic lights were working. So me and this boy were alone in this creepy house with the lights out so the first thing we did was turn in some candles, however for some reason the candles would never stay lit for very long and would keep blowing out. And then they all turned off at the same time and the tv turned on but not normal live tv the static kind and the sound was so loud it was ringing in my ears and when I went to turn off the tv the lights came back on and so was the static and live tv was back.  


We are supposed to move back home in one week but idk how much longer I can stay in this weird apartment. I don’t feel safe here.Is there anything I can do to stop these creepy occurrence.
