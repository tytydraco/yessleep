The legend crawls through the veins of the night shift workers, the insomniacs, the lost souls clinging to the last wisps of sanity. Whispered behind the jaundiced glow of flickering fluorescent diners at 3 AM, always with laughter too brittle, too quick to break.

I first heard it from Marcus, a security guard who looked like the city had spat him out and forgotten him beneath the chemical plant. We shared cigarettes in the bitter steam, watching our breath curl like funeral smoke into the void.

“There’s a bus stop,” he said, voice cracked and sour, “past the industrial park where the road just… ends. Only shows when the fog’s thick enough to choke. Two girls always waiting.”

Two girls. Not women. Not even fully alive. But girls. Suspended in a time and place that didn’t want them.

“Bullshit,” I told him. I was still trying to believe in things that made sense.

Marcus laughed—like brittle glass grinding in a cathedral. “Tommy from second shift thought the same. Went to see for himself last month. Found him three days later. Bath full of cold water, sitting like a corpse staring at the wall. Won’t say what happened. Can’t even look at fog without losing his mind.”

He crushed his cigarette underfoot, grinding it to dust like some unholy ritual.

“The talking one tells stories—real bad things, like she was there. The silent one just watches, listens, like she’s marking down every crack in your soul.”

“And if you look at them?” I asked.

His eyes darkened. “If you look, if you step close, if you sit between them… they see you. Then you’re part of their collection. Forever.”

The myth grew after that, bloated and shifting. The talking girl changed hair colors, outfits, faces—always beautiful but grotesque, like a porcelain doll whose smile hid rotted teeth. The silent one never changed. Never aged, never moved unless the ritual demanded it. The constants were the fog, the bus stop, and their impossible waiting.

I’ve been bitter long enough to crave proof the universe cares about suffering—even if that proof is a curse.

My wife left six months ago, took the light with her. Job vanished with a sterile HR email. Lease expires in a week. There’s nothing left but the echo of things I can’t unfeel.

So when the fog rolls in—thick as funeral linen soaked in rust and rot—I walk into the jaws of whatever waits.

The industrial park at night looks like a nightmare architect’s playground. Factories bloated with rust and metal tumors. Windows shattered like empty eye sockets. The fog turns everything dreamlike and wrong, smearing light and shadow into a wet smear across reality.

The road stops being a road. It becomes suggestion. It becomes memory. I taste copper on the air—like pennies sucked through broken teeth.

And then I see it.

The bus stop.

It blooms from the dark like a cancerous altar—an artifact too stubborn to rot away. A flickering streetlamp limps above it, casting jaundiced light that infects the fog. The glow oozes across broken pavement like a sickness.

Two figures sit on the bench.

Girls. Maybe women. It doesn’t matter here. Time forgets them.

The first is motionless. Black hair falls over her face like a funeral veil. Her skin has the pallor of drowned things—too smooth, too pale, stretched over bone like something the morgue forgot. She doesn’t breathe. Not really. Her presence is gravitational. Eyes like hollow voids fix somewhere beyond me, as if watching the death of things I haven’t yet done.

The other is alive only in contrast. She shifts, gestures, breathes in rapture. But her beauty’s wrong. Too perfect, too cold. Skin like glazed porcelain, lips too red, voice like velvet dipped in acid.

“—he told his daughter he was working late again. But in that motel room, with his brother’s wife, they savored their betrayal like poison in crystal goblets. Guilt made it sweeter. Sin, when seasoned with self-awareness, becomes a feast.”

I crouch behind a rusted pillar, heart thudding like a fist trying to escape my chest. Her voice threads through the fog—measured, sacred, devastating. It paints horrors so vivid I almost taste them.

“She kept a journal,” the girl murmurs, voice a liturgy. “Every lie. Every selfish act. Catalogued not for redemption, but remembrance. Immortal in her damnation.”

The silent one nods. Just once. A verdict.

Her companion’s voice lowers:

“She dreamed of them—every lie bloomed into a nightmare choir. She would wake aroused, soaked in the nectar of her own complicity.”

The silent one stirs again. Her fingers begin to trace something on the bench—sigils maybe, or names. I feel their shape inside my skull before I see them, like trauma taking form.

Then: headlights.

Not cars. Not real.

A bus, long and lean and blasphemous. Its shape stretches too far, its windows like gravestones, its body rusted as if grown from old blood and regret. It hisses to a halt like a beast that remembers dying.

The doors open with a brittle snap. A sound like vows breaking.

They rise in unison. The speaker’s final word hangs unfinished—something about a pastor who collected confessions not to forgive, but to consume. Then they step onto the bus.

No backward glance.

The bench is empty. Always is when I arrive.

But sometimes there’s a shape. A slight depression in the metal, still warm like a body just risen. Once, I found a coil of black hair. Another time, a torn strip of crimson lace fluttering like a surrendered flag.

They haven’t shown themselves to me. Not yet.

But the fog feels different now. Heavier. Knowing.

I feel them getting closer.

Waiting.

And I’ll come back. Again and again.

Because I need them to see me.
