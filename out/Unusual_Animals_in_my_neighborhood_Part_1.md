Hey Everyone, something weird happened today

My dog began barking at something in the distance, it was unusually loud and aggressive barking at that. I stepped outside to see if I could find what was driving him nuts. But I found that virtually every dog in the neighborhood was the same way. A chorus of loud barking and aggressive growling. It’s like every dog could tell something was there that didn’t belong.

I went out further, making sure to close the door and not let my dog out. But oddly, he didn’t move from his original position in the slightest, even though he knew I opened the door. He has a habit of trying to get out when something interesting is happening, but not today.

I decided to walk around the neighborhood, it was slowly becoming dark, but just bright enough to see everything around me. The noise and chaos was slowly dying down, but some of the dogs still looked bothered, up on the highest and furthest place from open ground. Even the Pitbulls at the “drug house”, which typically menace the neighborhood with how often they escape.

I couldn’t find anything and went back home, but it was strange nonetheless. What would scare and rouse dogs like that? I’m not aware of any wild people in my area (I live in rural Florida), and they typically don’t act like this around Alligators. Maybe a Bear or Coyote pack? I don't know, but I have a bad feeling that this is only the beginning.

My Grandmother ran out of her room in absolute panic. She claims something large is resting in the large hole underneath our house (the Pitbulls dug a hole on the side of the house to rest in). We went in to listen, and we heard and felt something brushing along the pillars of the house, along with deep breathing.

It didn’t seem all that serious, but then my dog started barking really loudly, and we saw one of the Pitbulls heading towards the hole. He never liked those dogs, and actually chased them away on one occasion. Suddenly, we heard two sets of deep growling, one being the dogs. And whatever was under the house lunged out and grabbed the dog. We heard yelping for a second, until everything went silent. The creature went back under the house to probably eat its catch. 

My Grandfather wanted to go out and investigate, but we thought better of it. If it could kill something as strong as a large Pitbull in seconds, imagine how quickly it could kill us. We are definitely suspecting that this is a Bear. It sounds heavy and powerful enough. 

Right now, we’re all sitting in the Living Room. My Mom and Sister also came over to check on us. When we told them what happened, my Sister mentioned hearing something that sounded like Roaring once, but it was strange, almost sounding like a giant cat. Maybe this could give us a clue as to what’s happening.

I was at work for most of the day, but when I got back, my Grandfather told me that he and my mom investigated the hole, and found a lot of dirt and drag marks across the hole. No dog corpse though, thankfully. But a noteworthy dirt trail was found. It likely dragged the kill off with it, wherever it went. Some faint paw prints were also found, and they stated that they were huge. One being almost the size of my Grandfather's hand.

I don’t like this at all…

I woke up early this morning before work to see if I could find any Deer or Turkey. They typically hang out in a little wooded area to the east of us. I decided to take my dog with me. Being half-terrier, he’s extremely confident and takes charge when walking to the woods. But today, he seemed nervous, and he wasn’t the only one. 

We saw a small herd of deer. They all seemed extremely nervous, more so than usual. They stood in a circle, with none bending down to eat, constantly moving their heads from side to side. They only reacted once we got closer, fleeing towards the forest in seconds. We were both pretty rattled by this, with my dog already turning back the other way. 

On the way home, I saw what looked like the feces of a large animal. They didn’t look like deer droppings, and were far too large to be any dogs. It almost looked like a super sized version of cat feces. My dog was even more freaked out after finding this and pulled on the leash as hard as he could. After that, the walk back felt quick, as my dog wanted to bolt back as fast as possible.

Holy shit, I think I had an encounter with the mystery creature. I was driving back from work, and when I turned down our road, I briefly saw a pair of eyes as they turned and darted away. By the time I stopped my car, it was gone. I didn’t get a good look, but the body shape I saw was like that of a huge cat. The only cat that could fit that description is a Florida Panther, but I live in the Northern Peninsula, and Panthers haven’t been seen here in decades, possibly centuries. Maybe one managed to sneak up here? It’s improbable, but not impossible.

While I was stopped, I found something else. A massive dead hog, definitely a boar. The animal looked surprisingly clean, save for an opening at the stomach where the animal was eating from. Whatever killed it did so quickly and without much issue. Something that feels off for a Panther, being too small to do that to a boar. Though nature is full of surprises, so maybe it was.

Still, I feel like I’m getting closer to the truth, however horrifying it may be…

Well, it finally happened, I saw the creature in the flesh. No cars, no vanishing.

I decided to go for a walk, but my dog was practically begging to go outside with me. I decided to take him with me, as I felt safer with him around. But quickly into our walk, once we were near the woods, his demeanor changed into a defensive mode. He stood in front of me and began barking and growling. He’s a small dog, and certainly not able to stand up against whatever was out there. I scooped him up in my arms and turned around. 

But as soon as I started running, I heard the bushes near the road begin to rustle as I quickly spun around to face to oncomer. The creature stopped charging as soon as I saw it. But it stopped underneath a street lamp, allowing me to see it clearly.

It was no Panther, nor a Bear.

It was a Tiger, a full-blown Tiger. 

It was huge, must have been around 300-400 pounds, and was almost purely white, save for its blue eyes and black stripes and markings.

I nearly crapped myself, and started walking back, slowly. My dog was constantly switching between barking at the animal and trying to wriggle out of my arms and make a run for it. The Tiger followed, slowly but carefully. Its paw placement was deliberate, picking the the smoothest and quietest parts, as if it has been doing this for years. But the obvious doesn’t need to be stated. 

It began growling and snarling. Its teeth were enormous. It also tried to take a swipe at me with its paws, moving forward toward me, I was able to see its unsheathed claws.

It was getting closer and more aggressive, I had to think of something and fast. Carnivores have sensitive eyes, so maybe a flash photo from my camera could help, but I had to reach it without dropping or loosening the grip on my dog. I reached into my pocket to get the phone, but as soon as I did that, my dog made an attempt to get out, and the Tiger charged forward. The dog  jumped out of my shoulders as I landed on the ground. I managed to halt the Tiger with my feet and get the phone as it was pushing me forward with its body. 

I took a flash photo directly in the tiger's eye. It stopped him, but he swiped at my right shoulder before fleeing back into the forest, roaring in confusion and anger. I could still hear it afterwards as it was crashing through the swamp and forest, still roaring out. I was able to get back up, but I couldn’t move my shoulder, and my legs hurt. Still, I didn’t feel like sticking around in case he came back.

My dog made it back home before I did, as my mother followed him back to me. She helped carry me back and we went straight to the hospital. I explained to her what happened, and surprisingly, she believed me. The doctors and nurses were less convinced, until they saw the damage to my arm.

The cops were called, and they questioned me. I showed them the picture of the eye, and apparently, it and the wound were enough to convince everyone of what I saw.

I’m gonna try and get some sleep, I’ll update this in the morning.

Hey everyone. I’ll have to stay in the hospital for another day or so, but they say I wasn’t beat up too badly, I did have to get stitches for my shoulder, but thankfully, it was successful. My shoulder was dislocated, but they set it back in place without much issue.

I still have a lot of questions. Like what is a Tiger doing in the Florida Woods. Those guys are native to Asia and in Florida, you usually only see them in zoos, with both of my Hometown zoos keeping them. Still, I don’t know of anyone who keeps tigers, and with recent laws surrounding big cats outside of Accredited zoos and sanctuaries, I have my doubts that anyone around here keeps any.

The best lead I have is of a Circus that came through here a month ago. Apparently, it went defunct without any warning while here, and then merely ceased to be. The animals that were there seemingly vanished as well. Nobody’s sure what happened to them either. But if the Tiger is anything to go off of. They’re likely still out there, somewhere around here.

There’s lots of wilderness, hundreds of miles of it. And they could be anywhere in it. When I get out of here, I’m going to go searching for them. The tiger was only the start…
