I saw the clown on my thirteenth birthday.

We moved to Old Soul, Arizona shortly after I was born. Mom wanted to keep renting in Phoenix closer to her family, but Dad hoped to pay off a mortgage before he retired. Old Soul was far from the crowded city but it seemed like a good town to raise children in — low crime rate, low cost of living, not as hot as Phoenix in the summer, not as busy. That’s how my parents would describe it. 

When the bus dropped me off from school, the windows in our white house were like cysts in our cul-de-sac and the car in the slanted driveway was like an ingrown hair. My parents tried to have more children, but they were stuck with just me, after three miscarriages my mom mentioned once or twice and never again. I had dogs instead of brothers.

Restaurants changed company logos and colors but nothing was local to Old Soul. The buildings that weren’t bankrupt and abandoned had HIRING! APPLY NOW! posters fading by the front door. The hospital where my parents worked was thirty-or-so minutes away from our house, but it was still cheaper than Phoenix.

Sasha was my only friend. On good days, we would hang out behind the gym looking for half-smoked cigarettes on the ground. She let me use her perfume to cover the smell and sometimes her lip gloss. On bad days, she used to snap my bra like the boys when I finally started wearing bras. She sat next to me in math class, and I let her copy my work, even though she mocked my stick figures and song lyrics around the equations. It's been a decade since her family moved away and even longer since she died.
Mom wanted me to go to Phoenix for college, but Dad helped me move to Missouri for a computer science major. Missouri stood out to me from the lanyards and bumper stickers that army recruiters forced on me in high school.

I dropped out in my second semester, but I stayed in Missouri until the funeral. I was watching TV with spaghetti sauce on my chin when I got the call from my mom — heart attack at the hospital where he saved lives. 
I didn’t finish my plate. I didn’t cry, either.

The closer I get to home, the further away I wish I was. 

Mom offered to fly me in, but I want to be able to escape 
at any time I might need. I drive through traffic like my dad despised with the windows down to smoke like my mom enjoys. The heat bleaches my brain clean, except for my thirteenth birthday buzzing like flies in the dirty bulb of my skull.

Late July, hot and cloudless, lingered like a rotten smell. The carpets in our house reeked of dog piss. As I laid on my stomach before the TV, my parents argued in the kitchen. I liked cartoons and I hated clothes. I wore as little as I could get away with, especially when I didn’t have to worry about school. Mom was always yelling at me to put a shirt on, but I had nothing there to hide, except razor burn from armpit hair I didn’t even have yet.

My parents got me a gallon of vanilla ice cream because I didn’t like cake. I ate most of it by myself.

As a child I was strange and ugly. I liked to collect tadpoles in a bucket after a good spring rain, and I liked even more to empty the bucket and crush each squirming morsel. I wanted to shave my body but I didn’t want to brush my hair. I screamed when my mom tried to cut my hair in the kitchen with scissors, but no one cares when fat little girls cry. And no one comes to our birthday parties, either.

The fried baloney from breakfast I stuck to the TV was slowly peeling off like a fresh scab, leaving behind a ring of grease. I turned down the volume for the commercial break, but music kept playing. I’d seen the commercials before, but the jingle wasn’t familiar.

I heard a knock — not at the door, but from inside the house. 

From my bedroom.

My parents were still fighting in the kitchen. The dogs were sleeping. The music wasn’t coming from the TV.

The knock came from inside my closet.

I walked naked to my bedroom, spoon in my mouth. I couldn’t taste ice cream anymore, only a bitterness like blood at the back of my throat. I suddenly wanted to wear clothes and never take my shirt off again.

I almost choked on my spoon when I touched the doorknob. 

It burned, worse than bare feet on hot concrete.

The closet opened for me, and the clown smiled.

He held a gloved fist in the air, ready to knock. Spittle smeared his greasepaint and the corners of his red mouth. His small eyes shined like new dimes, entirely white without pupils. Dollops of ketchup squeezed out the seams of his neck and wrists, dripping on the carpet. He oozed pepto-pink where his suspenders pinched into his flesh.
I couldn't tell where the jingle was coming from, at first, until I saw the key turning in his neck. I just sucked on my spoon and tasted blood.

He opened his smile. I felt warmth down my legs before I noticed I was urinating. The bones of his jaw crunched like dry cereal and broke through the skin of his face. My spoon dropped between his red rubber feet. The jingle hiccuped and then sped up as the key burrowed into his brain. The soft jelly of his eye sockets popped, splattering my open mouth with confetti.

And in my closet, and in the clown’s face, was another, smaller face. Bloodless and hairless as raw chicken.

I screamed at it, and it screamed at me.

Sasha was never as ugly as I was. She didn’t usually want to hang out during summer, but after my birthday, she wanted to drink with me at the creek near her house. School was a few weeks away, and the first day of August was forgotten as I waited in front of the TV for a thunderstorm to pass.

By afternoon the clouds were gone but the creek was almost flooded. As soon as my parents dropped me off at Sasha’s house, she showed me the booze in her backpack. Her parents were nicer to me than my own, although I couldn’t speak enough Spanish to hold a conversation beyond pleasantries.

Sasha held the hair out of my face as I wiped vomit from my mouth and confessed, “I think I’m a bad person. I used to hurt animals. A lot. Our dogs. I used to step on tadpoles.”

“Do you still do it?”

“No. But I’m a monster.”

“Why did you stop?”

“Because I realized it was bad.”

“So you didn’t know it was bad before?”

“I - I don’t know. I think I just did it because no one - but that doesn’t make it better.”

“It doesn’t, but you stopped, and you feel bad. That has to mean something, yeah?”

“Do you hate me?”

“You’re the nicest person I’ve ever met. And my only real friend. Everyone hates me, you know? I’m kind of a bitch. 
I do bad things, too. And I haven’t stopped.”

“But not to animals.”

“Is it worse to do it to animals?”

“They’re helpless.”

“Yeah, but so are other kids. What did you do to the dogs?”

“I found one in the middle of the road. Chewing on his leg. I poked him with a stick. In his guts. He wasn’t dead.”

“That’s all?”

“I shouldn’t tell you this.”

“What are you afraid of?”

I puked again. We kept drinking.

“It’s this town,” Sasha said. “You’re afraid of Old Soul. So am I. We need to get out of here. You won’t be afraid anymore.”

The highway wasn’t far from the creek. Sasha stuck out her thumb and told a truck driver we were trying to make it back to our campground. Twenty miles from Old Soul, in the opposite direction from the hospital where my parents spent long hours, the driver started touching Sasha’s hair. And then her thighs. She spat in his face, opened the door and pulled me with her.

I sprained my ankle as we fell into the dirt by the side of the road. She wanted to keep walking. I limped to a gas station to call my parents, and a ranger found Sasha later the next day sunburnt under a juniper tree. 

I wasn’t her only real friend. I wasn’t good enough.

I chewed the loose skin on my bottom lip, wishing for one of those candies in the goldfish bowl on the receptionist’s desk.

“Is it your mom?”

“Not really.”

“Is it your dad?”

I repeated, “I dunno,” in the same monotone.

“You know you can trust me, right? I’m here to help.”
But she wouldn’t be able to kill the clown for me.

“My parents say I have a big imagination.”

The nurse patted my knee. “You sure do, hon.”

“Can I go home now?”

“Well,” she said in a disappointed adult voice, “make sure you rest your ankle. Keep a pillow or two under your foot. Don’t watch TV before you go to bed, okay, sweetie?”

Sasha didn’t call for a few weeks, and I didn’t know if I wanted to pick up the phone when she did. I wasn’t a nice person. If I was, I would have stayed with her when I sprained my ankle. I would not have let her come over after I met the clown.

“Wanna drink with me?”

“Not really.”

“I got whiskey,” she said. “My parents are pissed at me. I can’t watch TV. Can I spend the night?”

My parents agreed to let her spend the night as long as we turned off the TV by eight o’clock. She did bring her whiskey, but we only drank soda. When my parents went to bed, she wanted to sneak cigarettes from my mom’s purse, but we couldn’t find it.

“I can’t sleep,” she said as we laid on my bed. She didn’t like sleeping alone on the couch. “What’s that noise?”

“Huh?”

“Did we turn off the TV?”

I nodded. My mom slept lightly and would have noticed.

“Don’t you hear it?”

“Hear what?”

“The music. Like a carnival.”

I felt the sudden urge to use the bathroom. “What… music?”

“It sounds close.” She got off the bed and stood in front of my closet. “It’s getting louder. Did you break a toy? Do you still have toys? And it smells bad, too.”

“I told you, my room is messy. Let’s play with the dogs. They like you a lot. We can go for a walk. Maybe my mom left her cigarettes outside. I’ve got a lighter —”

“It stinks! Can’t you smell it?” She jerked her hand away from the hot doorknob. “What are you hiding?”

The closet opened.

And the clown smiled.

I never saw the clown again.

And no one else saw Sasha, either.

No one looked for her.

I stop for the bathroom. A woman on the hood of a station wagon takes a drag of a Marlboro, greasy burger in her other hand. I haven’t eaten since breakfast at a hotel along the way.

A man in a denim jacket approaches the smoking woman. His face paint flakes off like dead skin. He takes the cigarette from her and stubs it out on her forearm.

“I love this town,” he gargles, his phlegm-thick voice like a clogged toilet. “Old Soul is where we belong, forever.”

I shut my eyes until the clown goes away and the station wagon is gone. My phone starts to ring; my mom is calling. I sit in my car and try not to cry.

She wants to know when I’ll be home. I tell her in a few minutes and I hang up after love you, too.

I take the long way, past the creek where Sasha and I got drunk. I try to focus on the road. I’m afraid to see the cul-de-sac. I’m afraid to go home.

Part of me was so relieved when my father died.

We have pictures of my dad on my thirteenth birthday, smiling at my mom behind the camera as he scoops out ice cream for me. His hands. The kitchen. He could be nice to us, sometimes.

I stop down the street from the cul-de-sac, idling my car. I don’t have to do this. I don’t even have to go back to Missouri; I can go anywhere I want. I could, but I’m so tired. I want to go to my bedroom and lock the door.

My phone rings again.

“Hello?”

The jingle is familiar to me now.

“I hate you. I hate you for everything. Why couldn't you be normal? Is that so hard? It was. It is. I can't be normal. I hate you so fucking much. You aren’t my friend! I HATE YOU!”

I throw my phone into the passenger seat.

“I hate you, I hate you, I hate you. You aren't my friend! You never were! You were supposed to protect me! You let it happen! AND I’M HAPPY YOU’RE DEAD!”

I shove my fingers into my ears. I don’t question how deep they go. I don't feel any pain. I feel like a child again. When other people say that, it means they feel safe and happy. When I do, it means I feel scared and angry.

I don't want to see my mother. I don't want to go to my father's funeral. I don't want the eulogies, the polite conversation, the sorry-for-your-loss and the you-got-so-big.

I suddenly feel ecstatic, like the first time I masturbated. My body shudders, and I understand what to do.

I tear at the skin of my face like shredded cheese.
After the night at the creek, I never told anyone else about what I did to animals. I don't know how. My parents knew but I went to a counselor for my bad grades, not for the dogs. Or the tadpoles. Or Sasha.

A pressure builds in my skull, and I slam my head into the steering wheel. Honk honk hoooonk. Cracks form on the surface of my forehead like popcorn in the microwave.
Ketchup splurts out my mouth and ears.

Finally, finally, it breaks.

I break.

I am strange.

I am ugly.

And I smile, and it [smiles.](https://x.com/sadappearance)
