*The light was heatless, yet it burned. Silent, yet it screamed. The sound was loud and droning like a church organ and it shook my bones within my flesh.* 

&#x200B;

*It seared away my meat, leaving my bones black and charred. My vision blurred and bubbled before fizzling away as my eyes boiled out of their sockets. My anguished screams faded into the noise as I was flayed down past my mortal husk and exposed wholly to the light. I screamed as I felt it engulf me, taking me into it and making me one with it, burning me from the inside out as my mind seemed to buckle in on itself from the assault upon its every sense…*

&#x200B;

And then I woke up, my body drenched in cold sweat. My limbs trembling as tears streamed down my cheeks. I pulled the flimsy blanket over myself as I curled into a ball and sobbed. My flesh was still… For the most part… Intact. My heart still fluttered pointlessly inside my chest. I was in my room. I was in my Hell. 

&#x200B;

This wasn’t the first time I’d had the nightmare. It wouldn’t be the last either. 

&#x200B;

The nightmares didn’t come like clockwork. But they came often enough. Dreams of light, of burning, of screaming… Dreams of music. I stumbled over to the toilet in the corner of my room to vomit up the half digested nutraloaf I’d had for dinner. Somehow it tasted better coming back up than it did going down. My limbs failed me after that and I collapsed to the floor, fading in and out of consciousness. I heard a voice whispering something but didn’t immediately register the words.

&#x200B;

*“Father Abraham had many sons,*

*Many sons had Father Abraham.*

*I am one of them, and so are you,*

*So let's all praise the Lord.”*

&#x200B;

The same song I’d heard on the radio, the first night I’d seen the light. It wasn’t the first time I’d caught myself singing it or humming it… The words just tumbled past my lips without me needing to think about it. I never really knew why… But thinking on them brought back vivid memories of Minnie and her own mumbled rendition of Amazing Grace. I wondered if something similar had seared that song into her brain, just as ‘*Father Abraham*’ had been seared into mine. 

&#x200B;

I drifted in and out of sleep for a while as I lay mindless on the floor, and I only fully woke up again when I heard that old familiar pounding at my door.

  *“Up and attem, Sinner! The Lord has blessed you with another day upon this earth and you’re gonna spend it in His Glory!”*

&#x200B;

Slowly I picked myself up off the ground and made my way into the hall with the other women. I stripped off my clothes and tossed them into the hamper before washing yesterday's grime and sweat off of my body. 

&#x200B;

I wasn’t sure just how long it had been since I’d first come to Smokey Oak. Every day blended into the next. Monday to Saturday, we worked in the fields. On Saturdays, Patrick would take some of us to the Cave to be judged, although he hadn’t picked me to go with him since that first week.

&#x200B;

On Sundays, we rested. We were fed our meal later in the day and instead of being ushered into the fields, we were ushered to a podium where Father Abraham would be waiting for us. He would give a sermon, and then we would be ushered back to our rooms to contemplate his words… Truthfully I just used the time to sleep. We didn’t get a second meal on Sundays. Really, we were only out of our rooms for the sermon and nothing else on those days. 

&#x200B;

Rachael was gone. 

&#x200B;

The day after her Judgment, Father Abraham had brought her on stage during his sermon as an example of purity.

  “This is the ideal you should strive for.” He said, “This is the redemption you should seek!”

As he spoke, Rachael had just stood there, a vacant smile on her face and a faraway look in her eye. When they’d walked us back to our rooms, I’d watched a man I’d seen at Church a couple of weeks before taking Rachael to his car, arms wrapped around her and a big warm smile on his face. He whispered soft assurances to her, but she barely seemed to hear him. She walked where he guided her, otherwise she didn’t move at all. Her heart was still beating. Her body was still alive… But just looking at her, I knew that Rachael was dead. 

&#x200B;

Sometime during the next week, Bianca stopped working. She just stood thoughtlessly in the middle of the field, staring into space. I didn’t notice her until Jenny did, and I heard her call out.

  “Keep working, Sinner!”

But Bianca didn’t respond. Not really. Her head turned slightly to look at Jenny who held her rifle dutifully in her hands. Bianca stared at it for a moment before wordlessly walking towards Jenny.

&#x200B;

  “Back to work, Sinner!” Jenny warned, but Bianca didn’t listen. Her eyes remained fixated on Jenny as she drew nearer. There was nothing threatening about her approach. Her arms hung limply by her sides. I thought I saw tears in her eyes but I didn’t get a good enough look to be sure.

&#x200B;

  “Back to work!” Jenny cried again, although her voice was faltering a little. She raised her rifle and took aim at her but didn’t immediately fire. Bianca paused only for a moment, looking down the barrel of the gun before she continued her approach. She walked out of the field, towards Jenny’s gazebo, her eyes still trained intently on her.

&#x200B;

  “Final warning!” Jenny snapped although I thought I heard her voice shaking.

Bianca still didn’t listen. Jenny fired two shots, both into Bianca's chest. She collapsed backward, hitting the ground hard, sucking in ragged, shaking breaths as her white scrubs turned crimson.

&#x200B;

I watched Jenny stare down at her, eyes wide for a moment as if she couldn’t believe what she was seeing. Then she gritted her teeth, and pushed whatever human reaction to her own actions she’d just had down. Gripping her rifle with white knuckles, she approached Bianca as she lay bleeding on the ground, studying her for a moment before putting a third bullet in her head.

&#x200B;

The fields were silent for a moment, and Jenny looked up at us, blinking several times as if she had something in her eye. I think she might’ve been at a loss for words…

  “Well?” She asked, voice cracking slightly, “Back to work!”

She raised the rifle and fired two more shots into the air. Most of the other women jumped right back to work. A few were slower and couldn’t help but stare at Bianca’s corpse. I regret to say that I was in the former camp. 

&#x200B;

A few men came by to drag her body away about fifteen minutes later, and that was really the end of it. I allowed myself to slow down for a moment to watch as they took her, tossing her into the bed of their truck like a slaughtered animal, and for a moment I had a vivid fantasy of it being me and not Bianca they were taking. I imagined my own lifeless eyes, glassy and staring at nothing in particular. I imagined my blood seeping into the scrubs I wore. I noticed the dark stain in Bianca’s pants that had appeared after she’d died, and wondered if I’d mess myself too if Jenny shot me right then and there… I certainly hoped I wouldn’t… What an undignified way to die…

&#x200B;

Then again, Bianca clearly hadn’t cared. Why should I?

&#x200B;

Dignified or not, I almost envied Bianca as she was taken away. In a way, she was finally free and her freedom was far better than what poor Rachael had gotten. Rachael… I imagined her staring vacantly off into space in her home, going through the lifeless motions of existence during the day and crawling into bed with her husband during the night.

&#x200B;

Would he fuck her, the way she was? Would he strip off her clothes and climb on top of her, thrusting into her as she stared up at him, alive yet lifeless… Would she carry his children like that? A mindless, dead thing growing life inside of it… Was her present meant to be my future? Was this what Joel wanted from me? 

&#x200B;

Oh God… I couldn’t stop myself from imagining it… I imagined myself dead yet alive, humming that fucking song to myself as I drifted around Shannons house. I imagined myself being led to our bedroom by Joel… I imagined him stripping off my clothes and…

&#x200B;

No.

&#x200B;

No, I didn’t want to imagine that anymore. I didn’t want to think about it…

&#x200B;

But I couldn’t.

&#x200B;

Every day I woke up. Every day I washed myself in the communal shower. Sometimes, there were new girls. Some of those girls screamed and cried on their first day. Some of them begged us for help. Some of them didn’t even live through the first day. Every day I worked. Usually in the fields, but some days Martha would choose me for homemaking duty. Those days were the easiest. On those days, I did the laundry, I stocked the lockers and I helped Martha prepare the nutraloaf… She made it herself every day, although I could hardly call the process a labor of love. And every day, I forgot a little more about who I used to be. I forgot Philadelphia. I forgot my job, my friends, my family. 

&#x200B;

Every Saturday, Patrick would take some girls to the shrine. Every Saturday, at least one wouldn’t return.

&#x200B;

Every Sunday, Father Abraham held mass. I stopped listening to his sermons early on. I stopped caring about any of it. I kept enough track of time to know that a month had passed, but after the first month it got harder. The days blended together. Father Abraham's sermons were really the best way to count the weeks but once I lost count, time stopped meaning anything at all.

&#x200B;

My hands blistered, then grew calloused. The ache in my body never fully went away but I learned to manage it. Sometimes I’d see Joel, usually from a distance and always on the mens side of the field. I got the feeling that Patrick was keeping him away from me. That was fine.

&#x200B;

I had nothing to say to him.

&#x200B;

Sometimes I considered killing myself… But I was never sure how. Would it be better to get Jenny to shoot me like Bianca had or would it be more dignified to die alone in my room one night? I got as far as tying my blanket into a noose one night, but didn’t have the stomach to go through with it…

&#x200B;

It was simple fear that kept me alive. Not just a fear of death. Death would have been welcome. I was afraid of heaven. I don’t know when, but at some point Father Abraham's rantings had gotten into my head. At some point I had begun to wonder if there wasn’t some truth to his sermons. After all - The Light existed and the Light manifested through him.

&#x200B;

Would it not then make sense that everything he said, everything he believed was true? And if it was, what did that really mean for me? What did it mean for my future? I knew that one way or another, I was going to die at Smokey Oak. Whether that was through taking my own life, or through winding up a living barbie doll for Joel, I was going to die.

&#x200B;

Logically, I could reason that suicide was the best choice. I could die on my own terms and not have to suffer whatever hell waited for me as Joel’s wife. But… The fear of the God that Father Abraham peached kept me alive. Was that cowardly? I didn’t know.

&#x200B;

I don’t know how many weeks I had been at Smokey Oak when the harvest came. We had arrived in early summer. June, I think. Now the leaves were changing. Now it was autumn. What month was it? September? October? Who knew… 

&#x200B;

I woke up to the same pounding on my door that woke me up every morning.

  *“Up and attem, Sinner! The Lord has blessed you with another day upon this earth and you’re gonna spend it in His Glory!”*

&#x200B;

I left my room. I showered. I ate. I went to the field. Jenny and her rifle lined us up before we could work, though.

  “Alright, sinners. Today’s the first day of the harvest.” She said, “As we have sown, so shall we reap… And you will reap by hand.”

She gestured to a plastic table that had been set out for us. Several old farming sickles waited for us there. 

  “You get to work. We clear this field today and we clear another tomorrow.” 

&#x200B;

Her tone was detached and a little cold. She studied us for a moment as if waiting for anyone else to speak before leaving us to our work. I picked up one of the more rusted sickles from the table. Truth be told, I didn’t really know how to use it. A few of the other women seemed to know how to handle them though. Those of us who weren’t so sure what to do followed their lead.

&#x200B;

It did briefly occur to me that a sickle like this might make for a useful weapon… But how would I use it? Charging Jenny with a rusted farming sickle sounded like an exercise in futility unless the goal was to die. She had a rifle. Even if all of us charged her, she’d mow us down without a second thought. 

&#x200B;

So instead we worked. I grabbed fistfuls of wheat and hacked away at them with the sickle. One of the other girls who seemed to know what she was doing told us to cut away from ourselves or to the side. The sickles were fairly dull, so the work didn’t go quickly. But I was used to slow, dull work at that point. The worst part was probably the strain on my back from all the bending down. A few girls collected the wheat we’d cut and piled it up as we worked. The sun above us rose higher in the sky. The crosses cast their shadows over the field.

&#x200B;

The work was different but this day played out little different than the others. 

&#x200B;

A couple of girls cut their legs by using the sickles carelessly. Jenny barely paid them any mind, regarding them with a mild annoyance before going back to tapping away at her phone. I wondered what she did on that phone all day…

&#x200B;

I just focused on my work. There was little else to put my mind to anyways. I caught myself quietly humming that old tune as I hacked at the wheat. ‘*Many Sons Had Father Abraham.*’ The lyrics drifted aimlessly through my mind, only stopping when I miscalculated a swing and buried the top of my sickle into the dirt. I grimaced and twisted it free, only to hear the metal snap as I did. The sharpened tip of my sickle was missing when I pulled it back. A small portion had snapped off. Not a lot, just a little. I stared at the broken edge of the sickle before thoughtlessly reaching down into the dirt to tug the broken tip free. It was almost as long as my index finger and still looked rather sharp…

&#x200B;

I pressed my finger into the tip and pulled it away when it drew blood. Yup… Absolutely sharp… 

&#x200B;

I almost tossed the broken tip to the ground, but somehow I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I instead looked at the sickle in my hand. The tool was old and rusted. The broken piece was noticeable, but at a glance it would be easy to miss. Something told me that nobody else was going to see it… I looked at the broken piece of metal in my hand. I remember thinking that if I wanted to, I could slash my wrists with it… It might even be easier than hanging myself…

&#x200B;

Maybe…

&#x200B;

I looked around before pocketing the broken piece of the sickle and set back to work before Jenny noticed that I’d paused. Somehow, the weight of that piece of metal in my pocket made me feel a little happier… Somehow…

&#x200B;

Come the end of the day, we left our tools on the table where we’d found them. Jenny didn’t bother looking at them. She didn’t notice that mine had broken. She just marched us back to our cabin for dinner. That night, I used the broken piece of my sickle to cut a hole in my mattress, and I tucked it gently inside where nobody could find it. Nobody but me.

&#x200B;

The next day, we were back in the fields. And the day after that too. During the nights, I considered using my little secret knife to open my wrists, but I still wasn’t quite ready yet… I needed to work myself up. Maybe I needed something to push me to the edge. Something to motivate me. But whatever it was I needed didn’t come. Not yet.

&#x200B;

On Saturday, Patrick took three of the women to the cave. All three came back, shaken but alive. 

&#x200B;

On Sunday, Father Abraham gave his semron. I didn’t listen to a word of it. As he spoke, I stared at him as he spoke, hearing him but not listening and wondering if tonight would be the night I finally had the guts to kill myself.

&#x200B;

Maybe…

&#x200B;

Maybe…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After Father Abraham's sermon, we were led back to our rooms as per usual. I sat on my bed, staring out my window, that fucking song still echoing through my mind along with faint memories of light and burning. This was no different than any other Sunday.

&#x200B;

Until I heard the knock at my door.

&#x200B;

I paused, looking back towards my door as it opened just a crack. 

  “Ten minutes.” I heard Jenny say, “And keep it in your pants.”

  “Of course.” A familiar voice replied, “Thank you.”

&#x200B;

The door opened all the way and a man I barely recognized stepped in. A man with gentle eyes and a beard he hadn’t had a few months ago… 

&#x200B;

Joel.

&#x200B;

The door closed behind him, and he offered me a warm, almost apologetic smile.

  “Hey honey…” He said softly.

I stared at him, not dignifying him with a response. My eyes drifted to the gun holstered on his hip. Probably standard equipment for working at Smokey Oak…

  “I’ve been asking Patrick when I could visit you… He’s said no for the most part but, well… Jenny and Martha are a little more agreeable to this sort of thing. They’re actually good people. They really are. They tell me about you every now and then…”

&#x200B;

  “What’s to tell?” I asked quietly. He didn’t answer. He just wrung his hands before forcing another hollow, stupid, meaningless smile. 

  “How’ve you been holding up?” He asked. I tilted my head to the side.

  “Peachy.” I said after a few moments. 

&#x200B;

A heavy, unsettling silence sat between us. Joel seemed to recoil from my gaze… And the sight of his shame disgusted me.

  “How’s Shannon?” I asked calmly, “Did she die yet?”

  “N-no, she’s fine!” Joel assured me, “As fine as she can be. Trucking along.”

  “Shame.” I said, “Why are you here?”

  “I… I missed you.” He said softly, “Dani, I know you probably don’t think so right now, but I do still love you. Despite everything, I love you.”

  “Is that why I’m here?” I asked coldly, “Because you love me?”

&#x200B;

Joel sighed.

  “You’re here because you offended Father Abraham.” He said, “You tried to expose him as some… Some sort of monster, when he’s anything but! What you thought you saw back at the Church, you couldn’t understand-”

&#x200B;

  “I understand everything.” I said, “I understand that you worship a self absorbed, pompous psychopath… I understand that your brother is a raving lunatic, just like your mother. And most importantly, I understand that I married a spineless yes man… That’s all perfectly clear to me now. It wasn’t before… No. No… I made excuses for you before… I let so much go after we came here despite every possible red flag telling me to leave and look where that got me?”

I extended my arms, gesturing to the bare room we shared.

  “That’s what I understand, Joel.”

He finally looked me in the eye.

&#x200B;

  “Then you’ve still got it wrong.” He said, “Father Abraham is fighting to save us. Our country. Our world. Our souls. It’s not pretty. Truth never is. But this is the way things have to be!”

  “I’ve seen more people die in the time I’ve spent here then I ever thought I would.” I replied, “If that’s salvation, I’d rather be damned.”

  “Please, please don’t say that…” Joel pleaded, drawing closer to me. Our eyes met and my hand slipped down to the hole in my mattress.

&#x200B;

  “All I want is for us to be together. That’s all I’ve ever wanted.” He said, “When the new Society comes, I want you to be a part of it. I want our children to be a part of it… I’ve fought for you every step of the way. I begged Patrick to have you Judged. I begged him not to hurt you the way I’ve seen him hurt Briar. I’ve done everything I can to save you, Dani. Please. Please, just open yourself up to see. Please… For me…”

&#x200B;

I had to stop myself from laughing as I palmed the piece of the sickle I’d hidden away. There wasn’t much thought or logic in my actions. Not really. Just cold hatred and more importantly, understanding.

&#x200B;

I finally knew how I wanted to die.

&#x200B;

  “For you?” I repeated.

  “Can you do that for me?” He asked, “Please…”

I was quiet for a moment before nodding.

  “Okay…” I said softly, “I can try…”

He closed his eyes, letting out a relieved exhale.

&#x200B;

  “Thank you, thank you, thank you…”

  “Joel…” I said softly, “Can you show me that you still love me?”

  “Of course baby, anything for you. Anything. Anything…”

  “Kiss me…”

&#x200B;

He smiled, tears filling his eyes as he approached me.

  “Just open yourself to the Lord, Dani… And you’ll be home for Christmas…” He promised as he drew nearer. He crouched so he’d be on my level and cupped my cheeks as he leaned in to kiss me.

&#x200B;

That’s when I jammed the broken fragment of the sickle into his neck.

&#x200B;

Hot blood ran down my hands as Joel let out a startled cry. He pulled back with a sudden, sharp yelp. Blood trickled down his neck as he stumbled away and I leapt from the bed, storming after him. I crashed into Joel, sending him to the ground as I slashed blindly at his face, carving off part of his nose and leaving gashes in his cheek. But I still wasn’t strong enough.

&#x200B;

With a defiant roar, Joel threw me off of him, rolling us until he had me pinned to the ground.

  “BITCH!” He snarled, “BITCH!”

&#x200B;

I jammed the broken piece of the sickle at his neck, but ended up embedding it in his shoulder instead. I tried to pull it out but he knocked my arm away and punished my defiance with a punch to the face that left me seeing stars.

  “WHY WON’T YOU LET US HELP YOU?” He snarled, “WHY WON’T YOU LET ME SAVE YOU DANI? WHY? ***WHY?***”

&#x200B;

My legs squirmed as I tried to kick him off of me, but I couldn’t move him. Not by force, at least. With one free hand, I reached down beneath his legs until I felt the squishy bulge of his balls, and I squeezed as hard as I could. Joel cried out in pain as I ripped the shard of the sickle out of his arm and squirmed out from underneath him. IHe braced himself against the wall to try and stand, looking at me with a rage that reminded me more of Patrick than of the man I’d married.

  “God DAMN it…” He roared, “GODDAMNIT…” He pounded a fist against the wall. 

&#x200B;

I held the broken sickle blade in my hand, waiting for another opening to strike as Joel rose to his feet. He glared pure venom at me, panting heavily as he waited for me to come for him again. I didn’t disappoint him.

&#x200B;

But this time, I didn’t land a hit on him. Joel planted a kick square in my stomach knocking me back and sending me crashing to the floor. From the corner of my eye, I saw the edge of my metal bedframe racing to meet the side of my head, and then…

&#x200B;

Nothing. Not even pain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*I remembered this place…*

&#x200B;

*Joel and I had lived here once… This was our apartment. The black leather living room sofa felt comfortable and familiar to me, and I could see our TV with the Xbox we’d used as a glorified DVD player underneath it.  I relaxed back into the couch, letting out a contented sigh as I did. This was nice… It almost felt peaceful and for the first time in a long time, my entire body didn’t ache.*

&#x200B;

*It felt good to be home.*

&#x200B;

*A large white dog that I didn’t recognize lay curled up on the couch beside me. It was too big to be a husky. It almost looked like a wolf, but that couldn’t be right. We’d never owned a pet wolf, that would be way too high maintenance. Were pet wolves even allowed in the apartment building?*

&#x200B;

*Come to think of it, I vaguely remember thinking something along the lines of: ‘I thought we sold this place? Weren’t we moving?’ before some memories drifted back to me.*

&#x200B;

*The drive to Smokey Falls… Moving in with Shannon…*

&#x200B;

*Father Abraham.*

&#x200B;

*The prayer circles…*

&#x200B;

*Smokey Oak…*

&#x200B;

*Joel…*

&#x200B;

*Oh… Right… Joel…*

&#x200B;

*The wolf beside me looked up as the memories came back to me.*

  *“Something the matter?” They asked.*

*For some reason, the fact that they’d spoken to me didn’t seem to bother me at all.*

  *“I don’t know…” I said, “I remember falling… My head…” I paused.*

*I had fallen, hadn’t I? I vaguely recalled something about my head hitting the bedframe. For Christ's sake, is that how I died? Seriously?*

  *“You did have a nasty fall, didn’t you?” The Wolf asked. I looked over at it, before frowning.*

  *“Am I dead?” I asked.*

  *“Do you want to be dead?” They replied, yawning and getting up off the couch. They did a big stretch before sitting down and looking at me with cool blue eyes.*

&#x200B;

  *“I’ll take that as a yes…” I said with a sigh, before flopping back onto the couch, “So is this a hallucination, or something else?”*

  *“I usually use the term Judgment, but I suspect your understanding of that word is far different from my intent in using it.”*

*I glared at the Wolf.*

  *“And how exactly are you using it?” I asked.*

&#x200B;

  *“Normally we’d discuss your life. The good you’ve done, the bad. Your regrets. That sort of thing. Admittedly, part of it is to help you come to terms with your fate, although part of it is to give those who’ve lived more… Complex lives a chance to plead their case. Really these conversations are not one specific thing. It varies depending on the person… Although as I said before, it’s really up to you whether you’re dead or not this time. Your body isn’t dead… Yet… Injured, yes. But not dead. I could send you back with no problem, if you want… Although, given the state you were in, I’m not sure if you would want that, would you?”*

*I narrowed my eyes at the Wolf.*

  *“You sound like you’re full of shit.” I said.*

  *“Oh, I assure you I may well be one of the most sincere people you’ll meet.” The Wolf replied.* 

  *“And who exactly are you?” I asked.*

&#x200B;

  *“I go by many names. Lately I’ve been fond of ‘Malibu.’ Not sure why. People seem to have started calling that as a mispronunciation of one of my older names… It’s all six of one, half a dozen of the other to me…”*

  *“So what, are you God?” I asked, “The light I saw in the cave… Was that you?”*

  *“Absolutely not.” The Wolf said, sounding genuinely offended “That little upstart likes to think he’s a God but really he’s little more than a parasite that won’t quite die… He mistakes my tolerance of his existence for acceptance. And that little town of his…” The Wolf made a noise of disgust.*

  *“So you’re not God, then?” I asked.*

 

 *“I’m far more in line with what you might think of as God than he is, of that I assure you.” Malibu said, “That fucking parasite… Sometimes I’ve half a mind to remind him of his place. But… That’s not my way to get so involved.”*

&#x200B;

*The Wolf… Malibu closed their eyes and seemed to exhale. Where a Wolf had been a moment before now stood a woman in a black dress, with short light blonde hair and a white fur shawl around her shoulders. Something about her style seemed antiquated. Like something from the 20s or 30s. She held a cigarette in a long black holder and took a drag on it.*

  *“I’m sorry, I’m losing my temper… It’s unbecoming. Between you and me, I’m not fond of that little town. I’m sure He’d argue that I’m only upset because he’s the one who reaps their dead. But it’s really not that… It’s what he does with them that bothers me the most.”*

  *“What he does with them?” I asked.*

&#x200B;

*Malibu looked over at me.*

  *“Do you want to know?” She asked, and I detected something coy and knowing in her voice. Something that sent a chill through me.*

  *“Come closer… I’ll tell you the truth about heaven.” She crooned, turning to face me. Looking into her eyes, I saw something inhuman there. Something different than the blinding light. Something…*

&#x200B;

*Slowly I approached her and she leaned in closer to me. She whispered in my ear… And when I heard her words, I couldn’t help but to laugh.*

  *“That’s the truth of it…” She said, “The truth he doesn’t want them to know…”*

  *“You’re serious… Aren’t you?” I asked, fighting back tears and laughter.*

&#x200B;

  *“I don’t lie.” Malibu replied, before pulling away from me, “Ah, but here I am talking aimlessly… This little meeting is really about you and your decision. Are you going to die today, Dani? Or do I send you back… Personally… I do think that you might yet do some good in that miserable little town if I sent you back. But ultimately, the choice is yours…”*

&#x200B;

*I really thought I’d already made up my mind… If this was death, I’d wanted it… But with her words echoing through my mind, with the punchline of the sick joke revealed to me, I couldn’t help but break down into laughter as the tears streamed down my cheeks.*

  *“What’s it going to be, Dani?” Malibu asked, “Live, or die?”*

*And through my cackling sobs I gave her my answer.*

&#x200B;

“Dani… Dani… Oh God…”

My vision was dark. My ears were ringing. My head hurt and I tasted blood.

  “Jenny… Jenny, call someone!” Joel called. I could hear his footsteps pacing my room as he breathed in heavy. My eyes opened slowly and I saw him glancing at me as he clasped his hands together.

  “I didn’t mean to… I didn’t mean to…” He stammered. 

&#x200B;

The blood from his wounds still trickled down his face. It couldn’t have been a few minutes since he’d knocked me out. A distant voice still echoed in my mind, whispering the truth he didn’t know…

&#x200B;

The beautiful, horrible truth none of them knew…

&#x200B;

The door was open. Joel stopped in front of it, looking out the hall warily. His back was to me. I bit my lip to stifle my laughter as slowly, I started to rise to my feet once more. My head lolled slightly to the side. My body still ached but I felt…

&#x200B;

Lighter.

&#x200B;

Free.

&#x200B;

I could feel the broken piece of the sickle in my hand… The idiot hadn’t thought to take it away from me. Of course not, he seemed to think I was dead… Oh, my sweet, sweet, stupid Joel… 

&#x200B;

He didn’t have time to react as I threw myself at him one last time. But I saw his body tense as he heard the scrape of my shoes against the wooden floor. I grabbed him from behind and in one fluid motion, I drew the broken piece of the sickle across his throat.

&#x200B;

Joel didn’t get any final words. His blood sprayed from his throat as he let out a strangled gasp. His body tensed up in my grasp and I felt him die…

  “Until death do us part, darling…” I whispered in his ear as I felt him slip away. Joel sank into my arms as his blood filled his throat. His hands went to his neck to try and stop the bleeding.

&#x200B;

He didn’t seem to mind when I slipped the gun from his holster and let him fall limp to the ground. His corpse twitched in its final moments, but I really didn’t pay him much more mind. He wasn’t important anymore. Nothing was important anymore.

&#x200B;

I felt myself grinning in a way I hadn’t smiled in ages… I couldn’t stop myself from laughing. I watched Jenny rush back into the hall, her fucking rifle still in hand. She froze at the sight of me, standing outside my door, my hands wet with my husband's blood. I saw a moment of panic in her eyes before she raised her rifle to me. But I was faster.

&#x200B;

Before worthless, lazy Jenny could get a shot off, I’d squeezed off six. Only two of them hit her. My aim wasn’t very good. But she went down like a sack of potatoes, hitting the ground with a pained cry. The rifle slipped from her grip as she pressed her hands to the new bullet hole in her chest. She looked up at me with big terrified eyes, opening her mouth to plead with me. But I didn’t really care to listen.

&#x200B;

I just sent her to Heaven and as I stared down at her corpse, a bloody hole where her face had been just moments before, I couldn’t help but laugh. I could still taste blood in my mouth. My hands were shaking as I let Joel’s gun fall to the ground and I reached down to take Jenny’s off her hands.

&#x200B;

She wasn’t using it anymore, right?

&#x200B;

I sang cheerfully under my breath as I made my way down the hall towards the cafeteria, the same tune that had been stuck in my head since fucking June.

&#x200B;

*“Father Abraham, had many sons,*

*Many sons had Father Abraham.*

*I am one of them, and so are you,*

*So let's all praise the Lord.”*

&#x200B;

I could hear her in the cafeteria… Probably trying to get into the offices out back. Martha. The last one…

&#x200B;

I knew she could hear me singing.

&#x200B;

I was glad she could.

&#x200B;

  “Martha?” I called out in a low, sing songey voice, “Where are you Martha?”

I stepped into the cafeteria and looked around. I didn’t see her… But I knew she was there… She had to be.

  “Come on out, Martha…” I crooned, “Don’t you want to go to heaven with your friend?” I couldn’t stop myself from giggling at that. 

&#x200B;

And then I heard her… Her low, frightened whimpering… Right behind the table where she’d served the food.

&#x200B;

Of course.

&#x200B;

Jenny’s rifle in hand, I rounded the table and found her right where I wanted her to be, huddled behind the table, tears streaming down her cheeks as if she deserved any of my fucking pity. No, no, no… She didn’t deserve a single ounce.

I stared over at the table beside us. There was plenty of uneaten nutraloaf still there… Naughty Martha hadn’t cleaned it up. How… Slothful? Wasn’t that a sin? I thought so… Not as much of a sin as feeding people nutraloaf but… Well…

&#x200B;

  “Hello Martha.” I said softly. Slowly I drew nearer to her. 

  “Honest question, have you ever tried your own cooking before?” I asked, “You really should… Quality control and all that…” I picked up one of the stale, dried pieces of nutraloaf off the table and studied it for a moment. My eyes settled on her again as my cracked, dry lips curled into a grin so wide that it hurt.

  “No time like the present, right?”

&#x200B;

Nutraloaf in hand, I advanced on her.

&#x200B;

When she tried to run, I shot her and when she tried to scream… I fed her… It was kind of sad, really… She didn’t even manage to fit three in her mouth before she started to choke. 

&#x200B;

When I left the cafeteria, the building was silent. I checked Joel’s body to find his car keys and I took those with me. I also took the keys off of Jenny’s body and unlocked the doors that I passed. No need to leave the others behind… When I stepped out of that cabin, out under the Sunday afternoon sky, I felt invigorated, and I couldn’t help but smile as I found Joel’s car and finally drove home.
