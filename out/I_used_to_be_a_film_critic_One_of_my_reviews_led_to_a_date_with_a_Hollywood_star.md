My name is Lauren Fontaine, and I love movies. I’ll give anything from *Dumbo*, to *Anomalisa*, to *House of 1000 Corpses* the time of day. Blockbusters, indie darlings, *Movie 43*! You name it, I’ve probably seen it or want to see it. I might not always like what I see but I rarely turn my nose up at movies.  
  
I studied Film & Television at UCLA, graduating in 2017. My family home is in Maine. The career opportunities kept me in California, not to mention the freaks of Los Angeles who made every day an interesting one. I had somehow managed to land a job as a film critic for an indie magazine, and was required to review three movies a week. That wasn’t a problem. The movie theater was my second home anyway and it came with free tickets! I wasn’t the calibre of critic that made an impact on the Tomatometer but it was a start.  
  
I shared an apartment in Santa Monica with Becca and Nick, who had met on the set of *La La Land*. They were seeking stardom along with the other billion struggling actors in L.A. In between the auditions and columns we all worked in the service industry. Becca waited tables at a vegan bistro, Nick was a barista at a hipster cafe, and I worked some evenings at a charming dive bar in Venice.  
  
That’s where I met Dean Gable, an actor most of the world would instantly recognize. As did I, feeling a little star struck when I saw him walk in with a small entourage. Later that evening as I was tending bar I overheard gushing fans asking for autographs. I turned to see him kindly oblige, even posing for selfies before the fans left in vocal excitement. He leaned over the bar and smiled.  
  
“Bet that never gets boring,huh?” I asked with a grin.  
  
He shrugged. “I mean I’m not always in the mood, but the alternative is a Perez article about how much of a douche I am. Ain’t nobody got time for that!”  
  
“In that case,” I said, sliding a napkin and pen across the bar. “I have Perez on speed dial, just sayin’.”  
  
He shook his head as he grinned. “And who should I make it out to, she-devil?”  
  
“Lauren will do just fine,” I smiled.  
  
He spoke as he scribbled. “Lauren, you drive a hard bargain! Yours, Dean Gable.”  
  
I clutched it to my chest before putting it in my pocket. “My roommates are gonna be stoked! You’re a gentleman.”  
  
“Hmm, debatable but I’ll take it. So, Lauren…”  
  
“Fontaine,” I said with a little flutter in my stomach.  
  
“What do you do Lauren Fontaine?”  
  
“Well, Dean Gable. As you can see I pour drinks for the degenerates of Venice beach. Speaking of which, what can I get for you?”  
  
He laughed. “Ouch! I’ll take three Coronas and a screwdriver.”  
  
“Coming right up!” I said, preparing his order.  
  
“What do you really do, Lauren?” he asked.  
  
“What do you mean?”  
  
“Your accent tells me that you’re not from around these parts, and 99% of bar staff in this city aren’t *really* bar staff. I’ll bet you’re chasing a dream.”  
  
“But what if I’m the 1%?” I smiled, removing the caps of three Corona bottles. “What if I just love serving drinks to nosey actors?”  
  
“Well, the way you so expertly prepared those beers, I’d probably believe you.”  
  
I laughed as I poured a measure of vodka. “It doesn’t pay the bills alone but I’m a film critic.”  
  
“My sworn enemy!” he said dramatically. “Unless of course you've nothing but good things to say about me?”  
  
I topped up the glass with OJ and put it on the bar. “I don’t recall writing anything negative about you, but I’ve written a lot over the last year.”  
  
He looked at the glass and then to me. “What’s that?”  
  
“You asked for a screwdriver?”  
  
“Yeah, I meant an actual screwdriver. I’ve got a few screws loose.”  
  
I shook my head as I facepalmed. “I *really* wanted to believe that Dean Gable was this effortlessly cool guy.”  
  
He chuckled. “Yeah, sorry to disappoint. I never miss the opportunity for a good dad joke.”  
  
“Was it good though?”  
  
He laughed. “You’re relentless, Lauren Fontaine.” He put a fifty down on the bar. “I’ll be looking out for your reviews.”  
  
His eyes burned into me and I felt my face warm up, laughing as I averted his gaze. He nodded as he carried the drinks over to his rowdy table, then saluted me when he left later that evening. I was more than a little surprised when a few nights later he returned alone, putting a magazine down on the bar. He cleared his throat.  
  
“...One of the most baffling things is Gable’s jarring attempt at taking the ridiculous source material seriously. If only he could have convinced us he was having fun. It could have turned this bargain bin flick into a guilty pleasure… Two stars, by one Lauren Fontaine.”  
  
Dean looked at me with raised eyebrows as I silently wished for the floor to swallow me.  
  
“So, about that...” I began.  
  
“Save it,” he interrupted. “How about you explain over dinner?”  
  
I felt butterflies in my stomach as I tried to hold back a grin. “What?”  
  
“Have dinner with me,” he smiled. “Let me redeem my awful performance.”  
  
I couldn’t help but let out a laugh, it was such a surreal moment. “This is some *Notting Hill* shit right here!”  
  
“Except our setting is a dingy bar full of tattooed muscle freaks, not a quaint English bookshop.”  
  
“And I didn’t spill coffee over you,” I added.  
  
“Well, there’s still time for that,” he winked.  
  
The next morning I couldn’t wait to tell Becca and Nick over breakfast. “Guess who has a date with a handsome A-Lister?”  
  
“Shut up!” said Becca with a mouthful of cereal.  
  
“He’s picking me up tomorrow night,” I grinned, feeling my face warm up. “For dinner.”  
  
“You bitch!” she grinned. “He’s totally gonna take you to The Ivy.”  
  
“The Ivy is old hat,” said Nick. “Catch is hot right now.”  
  
“He can take me to Popeyes for all I care,” I said. “I have a date with Dean fucking Gable!”  
  
That afternoon I talked Becca into accompanying me to the Aronofsky movie *mother!* before her shift at the bistro.  
  
“I don’t know about this,” she said in the foyer.  
  
“Come on,” I said. “It’s J Law. You love her.”  
  
“She’s this generation’s Farrow,” she said, trying to convince herself. When it was over she hugged me and said “I hate you” before leaving for her shift.  
  
I contemplated the movie’s themes over lunch. My general thoughts were somewhere between masterpiece and self-indulgence, but it was definitely the best Jennifer Lawrence performance since *Silver Linings Playbook*. I composed a review and submitted it to my editor. I chilled for the rest of the day, then Nick came home early that evening while I was making dinner.  
  
“You want some linguine Nick?” I asked.  
  
“Are you serving it with anything or…?”  
  
“Do you want some linguine and tomato-based pasta sauce smartass?”  
  
He grinned. “Yes please Lauren, love you!”  
  
We sat down to eat and I grated parmesan over Nick’s bowl. “Say when.”  
  
“Cheese is my weakness,” he said. “There is no when.”  
  
“That will do then, cheese monster.”  
  
“That would make a great midnight schlock movie. *The Cheese Monster*, starring Tara Reid and Patrick Muldoon.”  
  
I laughed. “Hey, at least they’re getting work though. Right Nick?”  
  
“Touche! But I did have an audition today for an Andrew Garfield movie.”  
  
“Seriously?”  
  
He nodded. “Think it went quite well too.”  
  
“That’s awesome! You could be on the screen with Spider-Man himself.”  
  
“Well, not the best Spider-Man but, you know. I’ll take it.”  
  
“Of course,” I said. “That’s Tobey Maguire.”  
  
“Of course,” he said. “But Emma Stone was definitely the better love interest. She was such a darling on *La La Land.*”  
  
“Was she?” I asked. “Do tell me more as you haven’t mentioned it for a few days.”  
  
“Me-ow bitch!” he chuckled. “Before I forget, I met one of my friends, acquaintances… whatever, at the audition. I told her about your big news because she’s such a gossip whore. Anyway, she said that she has a friend who has a friend who dated Dean Gable for a hot minute. Apparently he was into some fucked up shit.”  
  
“What do you mean?” I asked. “Like sexually?”  
  
“I don’t vouch that anything she says is gospel but there was mention of the C word.”  
  
“The C word?” I asked. “Cancer? Cunt?”  
  
“Lauren, you’re so crass!”  
  
“Tonight’s dinner is definitely brought to us by the letter C. Here’s another; cryptic!”  
  
“Okay,” he yelled. “Cannibalism!”  
  
“Nick! Like I ever would have guessed that.”  
  
“I know, it just felt weird saying it out loud.”  
  
“It is weird,” I said. “And ridiculous! The celebrity world is full of crazy rumors. Jamie Lee Curtis is intersex, Tupac is alive, Nicolas Cage is a vampire…”  
  
“Come on, there’s an argument for that one.”  
  
“Okay, I’ll give you that. But my point remains.”  
  
“But this is different Lauren,” he said. “Like I said, I don’t vouch for her or anything. But it’s strange you don’t read about this in the National Enquirer, don’t you think? I mean, rumors spread around this city like wildfires! You’d think Dean Gable cannibal rumors would be hot news. Unless it’s not a rumor, and everything has been done to keep it a secret.”  
  
I started to feel a bit unsettled. “Dude, you’re kind of raining on my parade here.”  
  
“Shit, sorry Lauren. I won’t say another word about it. You’re gonna have the best time!”  
  
I won’t lie; I didn’t sleep much at all that night. When I heard Becca come home in the early hours I went to greet her.  
  
“Have you forgiven me?” I asked.  
  
She blew hair out of her face. “You owe me another Jennifer movie; Aniston or Lopez. And rom-com only!”  
  
I made us some chamomile tea and Becca told me about her day. I slept a little better after that, sleeping in later than usual. It didn’t matter as I had a free day, which I spent anxiously thinking about my big date with one of Hollywood’s most eligible bachelors.  
  
“I was thinking about a little black number,” I said to Becca that evening.  
  
“Classic,” she said, rummaging through my wardrobe. “But safe.” She handed me a green floral midi dress with a side split. “It’s cute and quirky, but has a ‘your place or mine’ undertone.”  
  
I laughed. “I like that. I’m not usually that kind of girl, but you’re not *not* getting it.”  
  
“Exactly,” she said. “It’s just the right amount of sexy. But for the record I’d totally break my four date minimum rule for Dean Gable.”  
  
I spent far too much time in the shower and surprisingly little on doing my hair. The finishing touch was a spritz of Becca’s *Candy Gloss* fragrance.  
  
Nick made an appearance. “You’re giving me Deschanel Gyllenhaal vibes. In another world I’d be all over this.”  
  
“Thanks Nick,” I said. “In another world *you* would be going on the date.”  
  
“Ah, I’m holding out for Tom Hiddleston.”  
  
“I’d claw a bitch for Hiddleston,” said Becca.  
  
“Bring it on!” he laughed.  
  
The buzzer rang and we all looked at each other in silence. My heart was racing as I let out a long breath. I hugged them both and left the apartment with a small clutch and lightweight jacket. A smartly dressed middle-aged man stood outside our building.  
  
“Miss Fontaine?” he asked.  
  
I chuckled a little at the formality. “Yes, that’s me. Lauren.”  
  
“I’m Brandon Davies, Mr. Gable’s assistant. I’m here to take you to him.”  
  
He opened the rear door of a black car parked on the street and motioned for me to get in.  
  
“Wow, how fancy,” I said as I climbed in. I’m not good with cars but it looked brand new, and expensive! We started to drive into the city.  
  
“Where are we going, Brandon?” I asked. “The Ivy? Catch?”  
  
“Mr. Gable has a special evening planned at his home,” he replied.  
  
“I thought we were going out for dinner?” I said, confused.  
  
“Dinner will be prepared in his home, Miss Fontaine.”  
  
“Oh, okay,” I said, feeling a little anxious.  
  
“I can take you back home if you feel uncomfortable? I’m sure Mr. Gable will understand.”  
  
“No no, I’m fine. I just wasn’t expecting it.”  
  
“Very well, Miss Fontaine,” he replied. “We should be no longer than 30 minutes.”  
  
I spent the journey trying to guess where Dean lived. My original guess was Beverly Hills, then I switched to Los Feliz, but we ended up in Laurel Canyon. As we turned into a gated driveway Brandon pressed a button on the dashboard. The gates slowly opened, revealing grounds that were roughly the size of my neighborhood.  
  
“My God,” I said as we drove in. “How the other half live.”  
  
We stopped outside the large house and Brandon opened the car door for me, offering his hand as I stepped out.  
  
“Thank you, Brandon,” I said as I accepted the offer, taking in my surroundings. It was beautiful.  
  
“This way, Miss Fontaine.”  
  
We entered the grand house, the doors opening to a large entrance hall with a double staircase. Classical music was playing from somewhere within. I followed Brandon into a room where Dean sat in an armchair by a fireplace.  
  
“Mr. Gable,” said Brandon. “Miss Fontaine has arrived.”  
  
Brandon took my jacket and disappeared as Dean welcomed me. He was sharply dressed in light pants, a sky blue shirt, and navy sports jacket.  
  
“Lauren, you look beautiful,” he said, gently kissing my hand. I blushed.  
  
“You don’t look so bad yourself, Mr. Gable,” I said with a grin, making him chuckle.  
  
“I have insisted Brandon calls me Dean but he takes his role very seriously.”  
  
Dean took me on a tour of the house and the grounds. There was even an annex to the rear that could comfortably house a family of four.  
  
“I’m so glad you have all this, Dean,” I said. “I’d hate to think of you cramped up in a moderate three-bed apartment or something.”  
  
Dean tapped his chest. “Thank you, Lauren. That means a lot.”  
  
I shook my head. “I feel like I’m in a movie myself. This is crazy.”  
  
When we went back into the house Brandon held a tray with two flute glasses containing a sparkling beverage.  
  
“Thank you, Brandon,” said Dean, handing one to me. He held up his glass. “To remaining humble and relatable, despite one's fame and fortune.”  
  
We clinked glasses and I took a sip, becoming aware of the classical music playing from unseen speakers.  
  
“You never struck me as a classical kinda guy,” I said.  
  
“I’m not really, I was trying to make an impression.” He walked over to a device and the music stopped abruptly, replaced by something very synthy.  
  
“The Cure?” I asked.  
  
“This is my vibe, a part of me never left the 80s. Wait here a sec, I want to show you something.” He left the room for a moment and returned with a polaroid picture. There were three young men in full goth attire, makeup and all. “That’s me in the middle.”  
  
“No way!” I laughed. “Oh, this is gold.”  
  
“I would let you keep it but I’d worry it’d end up in your buddy Perez’s hands.”  
  
“I would never!”  
  
“I’m not sure I can take you for your word, Lauren. You also said you’d only written good things about me, but…”  
  
“Oh, about that,” I said, putting down my glass. “I almost forgot, I have something for you.” I took out a folded article from my clutch and handed it to him. “A peace offering.”  
  
He opened it and started to laugh. “...It’s so easy to look at actors like Dean Gable and discredit them as just another cut and paste face of the Hollywood elite. Gable challenges those preconceptions with a raw, uninhibited and brave performance. On a personal level, as a lover of film I’d like to thank him for supporting independent filmmakers. Their voices are important yet seldom heard…” He approached me and put a hand on my waist, giving me a shiver. “Thank you, Lauren Fontaine. This will do my ego the world of good.”  
  
Brandon appeared in the doorway and cleared his throat. “With apologies Mr. Gable, your agent is on the line. I’ve been asked to inform you it’s of the utmost importance.”  
  
Dean sighed. “I’ll be right back.”  
  
He disappeared for a minute or two. I stood at the open double doors that led to the rear of the property. The grounds were illuminated with soft lighting, and I noticed someone dressed in white walking towards the annex.  
  
“Lauren,” came Dean’s voice from behind, making me jump. “I’m really sorry but I need to take this call. I’ll be as quick as possible but it could be a short while. There’s a problem with a recent contract.”  
  
“Moviestar problems, amirite?”  
  
He nodded with a laugh. “Make yourself at home. Dinner shouldn’t be any later than nine.”  
  
I put my clutch and glass down and followed the gentle breeze through the doors, choosing to walk through the beautifully maintained grounds. When I reached the annex I could hear a loud noise coming from inside, like a drill or something. I peeked through a window and saw that a large television was on, and the back of a woman’s head watching it. I was confused but thought maybe Dean had guests staying with him and just didn’t mention it.  
  
As I carried on walking around the building I noticed the front door was slightly open. I was so tempted to go inside, my curiosity working overtime. I shook that idea and began to walk away, that is until I heard a man’s scream come from inside. My heart jolted as I turned, heading back to the door. I slowly pushed it open.  
  
“Hello?” I called. “Is everything okay?”  
  
The loud noise I’d heard had stopped, replaced by a muffled voice. I couldn’t make out exact words but then I heard distinct laughter. Shortly afterwards the drilling sound started again. When I turned back the woman who was watching TV was looking at me. I froze momentarily and then raised a hand to say hello. She slowly raised her own hand to return the gesture.  
  
“Hi, I’m Lauren. I’m a friend of Dean’s.” I started to walk towards her.  
  
“Hi Lauren,” she said very slowly. “I’m Penny.” She sounded spaced out. As I got closer I could see she was a pretty blonde 30-something. I won’t lie; I made some quick assumptions about why she was on Dean’s property.  
  
“Do you live here?” I asked.  
  
She nodded. “Oh yes. Dean is very generous, he looks after us.”  
  
“Us?”  
  
“Javier too,” she said. “Are you moving in as well?”  
  
I shook my head, beginning to feel uncomfortable. “No, I’m just visiting. I’m sorry to bother you…”  
  
“It’s no bother. Can I fix you a drink?” She looked like she was struggling to get up.  
  
“No, it’s fine. I’d better be…”  
  
When she stood she was holding crutches, and her right leg was missing from the knee down. It had a thick white bandage around it.  
  
“You poor thing,” I said. “What happened?”  
  
She looked down and giggled. “Oh, this? It’s all good, Lauren. I wanted it.”  
  
“I don’t understand, Penny…”  
  
Another scream came from behind me, making me jump.  
  
“That’s Javier,” she said, letting out a chuckle. “It’s his turn tonight.”  
  
My heart was racing as I began to walk away from Penny, following the voices.  
  
“Let me know if I can get you anything,” she said, sitting back down.  
  
As I passed the front door my instincts were telling me to run, to get out of there. But that stupid curiosity was eating away at me. Once again I heard laughter. It was coming from a room at the back of the house. I crept to the door and put my ear against it.  
  
“That’s it, Javier,” I heard a man say. “Deep breaths. It’ll help with the pain.”  
  
More laughter came, followed by a different voice. “It feels funny.”  
  
“Mr. Gable has a special guest this evening. Let's give them something special for dinner, okay?”  
  
More laughter. “Okie dokie doggie daddy!”  
  
The drilling sound began again. My stomach churned as I gently pushed the door with a trembling hand. I didn’t want to see, but I had to for peace of mind.  
  
There was a man in a disposable white forensic suit standing over an operating table. He had whatever was making the loud noise in his hands, but his back was to me. Laying on the table was a young man laughing to himself, who I assumed was Javier. I noticed a gas canister with a mask attached nearby. There was plastic covering the floor with various blood splatters.  
  
As I covered my mouth in shock Javier looked right at me.  
  
“Hello lady,” he said.  
  
I froze. The man standing over him turned. He was holding an electric carving knife in his hands. Javier was nude from the waist down, and chunks of flesh had been carved from his legs. There was a chopping board to the side with the cuts of meat.  
  
“Oh fuck!” said the man in the suit, lunging towards me. I screamed and pulled the door shut, running out of the building.  
  
“Bye Lauren,” I heard Penny say as I ran from the annex. When I braved a look over my shoulder the suited man was standing outside the door, but he made no attempt to give chase. I took advantage of it and removed my heeled shoes, hooking them over my fingers. All I could think about as I ran was Nick and the damned C word. He’d been right. I wanted to throw up.  
  
I got to the main house and ran all the way through it. I remember *A Forest* by The Cure was playing into the rooms as I burst through the front door. The driveway looked a lot longer on foot than it did in the car but I ran nonstop, opting for the grass as the gravel hurt my feet. I was *so* close to the gate, but someone tackled me from behind with a grunt.  
  
It was Dean. He straddled me and pushed down on my shoulders.  
  
“Such a shame,” he said, out of breath. “I liked you, Lauren Fontaine.”  
  
I struggled under his weight. “Please, let me go.”  
  
“Let me guess… You’re not gonna tell anyone, right?”  
  
I shook my head. “No, no one!”  
  
“Of course you won’t,” he scoffed. “Like this isn’t the juiciest story since the O.J. Simpson trial.”  
  
He leaned down and pressed his face against my neck, inhaling loudly through his nose.  
  
“You know, when you arrived this evening I thought you smelled good enough to eat. I never intended on actually doing it. I was only going to feed my livestock to you.”  
  
I squirmed as he laughed in my face. “Oh God, please no!”  
  
“They’re here by choice by the way,” he said. “They’re totally devoted to me. They consider it an honor. But something tells me you won’t see it that way.”  
  
“Dean, please!” I cried. "No one would believe me anyway!"  
  
He grinned. “I don’t usually eat straight from the bone, but I’ll make an exception for you Lauren Fontaine.”  
  
He bared his teeth as I screamed, but before he could take a bite out of me a gunshot took us both off guard. Brandon was standing nearby with a smoking handgun pointed to the sky.  
  
“Let the young lady go, Mr. Gable.”  
  
“Stay out of this Brandon!” sneered Dean.  
  
“No, I don’t believe I will sir.” He lowered the gun and pointed it at Dean. My jacket hung over his other arm and he held my clutch.  
  
“Have you lost your mind?” roared Dean. “This will end me, do you understand?”  
  
“The lady doesn’t strike me as one for gossip,” said Brandon. “Would I be right in thinking that?”  
  
I quickly nodded. “Absofuckinglutely!”  
  
Dean looked down at me like he wanted to pull my head from my shoulders, but he reluctantly climbed off. Brandon kept the gun on him as I got to my feet on shaky legs, picking up my shoes.  
  
“Miss Fontaine,” said Brandon. He held out my belongings which I took from him. “I trust you can make your own way home.”  
  
I nodded. “Thank you, Brandon.”  
  
As I left the property I couldn’t help but look over my shoulder, like it was a cruel trick. But Dean could only give me daggers as Brandon kept him at gunpoint. I walked for a good few miles trying to process what had happened before giving in and calling a cab.  
  
I’ve kept this to myself until now, but I finally need to get it off my chest. My name is Lauren Fountaine, and I survived the Laurel Canyon Cannibal.
