The drive was supposed to be easy.

I'd been feeling restless for a while, even though my travel blog was doing well. Traveling and writing had become repetitive, and I felt like I was just going through the motions. I missed the thrill of finding new places and the sense of adventure that made me start the blog in the first place. Lately, everything felt forced, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was missing something important.

I remembered when every trip felt like a real adventure, like the time I found a hidden village in the mountains or met a kind stranger who showed me a secret spot only locals knew about. Those moments used to fill me with excitement, but now everything felt dull. I needed something to remind me why I loved traveling - like when I found that hidden waterfall in Oregon or camped under the stars in the desert. I wanted that feeling of wonder again.

Driving from Chicago to Denver was supposed to help clear my mind.

But as the miles went by, everything looked the same: flat farmland that stretched forever. The monotony of the endless road was almost hypnotic, and I still felt lost and uninspired. It was like I was running away from something but didn't know what, and nothing I found along the way seemed to fill the emptiness.

Then I found Council Bluffs.

It felt different, almost like I was meant to stop there. The streets were unusually empty, and the buildings looked old and forgotten, like time had stopped. There was an eerie stillness in the air that made me shiver, like something was watching me from the shadows.

Council Bluffs was on the border between Iowa and Nebraska, next to the Missouri River. It had a simple charm to it . A gas station, an old diner that looked like it was from the 1950s, and a small church. Something about it made me curious, like there was more beneath the surface waiting to be discovered.

The motel I found was called the Silver Rest Inn.

It was right off the main road and looked old and run-down. The paint was peeling, and the old neon sign flickered as the sun started to set, casting long shadows across the parking lot. It was the kind of place people only used to sleep before moving on, and I figured it would be good enough for three nights.

As I parked my car, I felt the temperature drop suddenly, and I thought I heard a faint creaking sound, like an old door swinging in the wind. It made me uneasy. The air felt heavy, like a storm was coming, and my stomach twisted with worry.

I tried to ignore it and grabbed my bag, heading into the front office.

The room smelled like dust and something metallic that I couldn't quite place. Behind the counter was an old man with tired eyes. He nodded at me and spoke in a rough voice.

"Need a room?" he asked.

"Yeah, for three nights pleaseâ€¦" I said, smiling even though I felt a bit uncomfortable.

He hesitated for a moment, then handed me an old key with a wooden tag. "Room 7," he said. He paused, looking serious. "There are a few rules you need to follow."

I raised an eyebrow. "Rules?"

He nodded and pushed a small, yellowed piece of paper across the counter. The ink was smudged like it had been written a long time ago.

"It's nothing too serious," he said, but I could hear the unease in his voice. "Just things to keep in mind."

I took the note and looked at it. It had five rules:

1. Always close the bathroom door before sleeping, even if the light is off.
2. Do not open the window after 10:00 p.m., even if it gets hot.
3. If you hear knocking, check the peephole first. Do not open the door if no one is there.
4. At midnight, place a cup of water on the nightstand and do not drink it.
5. On your last night, leave a coin on the bedside table before you go to bed.

A shiver ran through me. "Is this some kind of local superstition?" I asked, trying to sound amused, though my voice was shaky.

The old man's smile faded, and he looked at me seriously. "Just follow the rules. Room 7... it's different."

I wanted to ask more, but the way he looked at me made me stop. Instead, I nodded and took the key and the note. "Okay, I'll follow them," I said, trying to sound casual.

The room was at the far end of the motel, and the door looked worn from years of use. I turned the key in the lock, and the door opened with a heavy click. The room was what I expected-a bed with an old floral bedspread, a small wooden table, and a bathroom with a chipped mirror. The air was a bit stale, so I walked over to the window and pulled the curtains aside to let in some fresh air. Outside, everything was quiet, with only the sound of leaves rustling in the breeze.

I looked at the note again, feeling a strange sense of worry. It was just a room, I told myself. I had stayed in plenty of rooms like this. But I couldn't shake the look in the old man's eyes-it was like he was warning me. The air felt heavy, and I could swear I heard a faint rustle, like something moving in the shadows, making my skin prickle.

The first night, I ignored the rules. I left the bathroom door slightly open, even though I felt a shiver telling me I shouldn't. What harm could it cause? I got ready for bed, feeling exhausted from the long drive. The bed was surprisingly comfortable, and as I lay there, I couldn't help but think about the strange rules. The unease lingered, making it hard to fully relax. Eventually, exhaustion took over, and I fell asleep.

I woke up at 3:00 a.m. The room was dark, but something felt wrong. The air was damp, like just before a storm. I looked at the bathroom, and my heart skipped a beat. The door, which I had left partly open, was now wide open. The darkness inside seemed to move, almost like it was alive. My heart started to race, and then I heard it-a deep growl coming from the bathroom, like an animal in pain.

Fear took over, and I forced myself to move. I swung my legs over the side of the bed, the floor cold beneath my feet. I crept toward the bathroom, my heart pounding in my ears. The growl stopped as soon as I touched the door, and I quickly pushed it shut, locking it.

I stood there, breathing hard, waiting for any other sound. But the room was silent again, and slowly the damp feeling in the air went away. I climbed back into bed, pulling the covers tightly around me, keeping my eyes on the bathroom door until I finally fell asleep. My dreams were uneasy, filled with fleeting images of shadows moving across the walls and whispering voices I couldn't understand. Every time I thought I was about to make out the words, I would wake up in a sweat, only to find the room quiet and still.

The next morning, I tried to shake off the fear from the night before. Maybe I hadn't closed the door properly, and the strange growl could have just been the wind or old pipes. I didn't want to think too much about it, so I spent the day exploring Council Bluffs. I took pictures of the Union Pacific Railroad Museum, the old Squirrel Cage Jail, and the Missouri River. The town was quiet and had a sort of eerie beauty to it. People were polite but not very friendly, and they seemed to look at me strangely when I mentioned the motel.

"You're staying at the Silver Rest Inn?" the waitress at the diner asked, her smile fading.

"Yeah," I said, trying to act normal. "Why? Is there something I should know?"

She hesitated, then looked around like she wanted to make sure no one else heard. "Just... follow the rules," she said quietly. "People who don't... well, they are never found again."

A shiver ran through me. Something about the way she said it made me feel like I was already in danger, like there was some dark secret everyone in the town knew but wouldn't share with outsiders. That night, back in Room 7, I made sure to follow the first rule. I closed the bathroom door firmly before getting into bed. I looked over the list again, my eyes lingering on the second rule: Do not open the window after 10:00 p.m., even if it gets hot.

The room felt stuffy. The air conditioner rattled, but it wasn't doing much to cool the room. By 11:00 p.m., I was sweating, and my shirt stuck to my skin. I knew what the note said, but no matter how hard I tried, I felt like I couldn't breathe, like something was very wrong with my throat. I walked over to the window and opened it, letting the cool night air in.

The breeze felt amazing, and I sighed with relief. But then I heard it : footsteps on the gravel outside the door. Slow and deliberate. My whole body tensed up. The footsteps got louder, and then there was a soft knock at the door. Then another, louder this time, like whoever it was wanted to be let in. My heart pounded as I crept towards the door, my eyes on the peephole.

I looked through the peephole, but there was nothing...just darkness. The knocking continued, getting louder and louder, echoing in the small room. I backed away, my gaze darting to the open window. The curtains moved with the breeze, and I rushed over to close the window. As soon as it was shut, the knocking stopped. The silence that followed was almost scarier than the knocking.

My hands were shaking, and I stood there, trying to make sense of it. There had been no one there, but the knocking and footsteps were real. I rushed to close the window, but it was like something invisible was pushing against it, making it almost impossible to move. I struggled with all my strength, my breath coming in ragged gasps, until finally, with a surge of effort, I managed to close it. 

Suddenly, the bathroom door burst open, and what seemed like an obscure creature on four legs lunged out. It looked like a twisted, shadowy animal-its body was long and skeletal, with jagged, bony legs that ended in sharp, claw-like points. Its face was featureless, a black void that seemed to absorb the light around it. My heart stopped as it came at me, and I closed my eyes, bracing for impact. But then... nothing. The sudden silence was deafening, as if the entire room had been swallowed by emptiness. I felt a strange, hollow stillness, like the world itself had paused. 

When I opened my eyes, the creature was gone, as if it had never been there. I collapsed onto the bed, my heart pounding painfully in my chest. I felt like I was losing my mind. I picked up the note again, and the words seemed even more important now. These weren't just silly superstitions-they were rules meant to keep me safe from forces beyond my comprehension.

That night, sleep did not come easily. Every small sound seemed amplified-the creak of the bed, the rustle of the curtains. I kept my eyes fixed on the bathroom door, half-expecting it to swing open again. When I finally drifted off, my dreams were filled with dark figures standing at the edge of my bed, their faces hidden, their whispers growing louder until I woke up, drenched in sweat.

By the third night, I was terrified. I knew there was something in Room 7, something dangerous. I had to follow every rule exactly. I closed the bathroom door, kept the window shut, and made sure to listen carefully before answering any knocks. But there was one rule I had forgotten-the cup of water on the nightstand.

It was past midnight when I remembered. My heart started to pound as I rushed to fill a cup of water from the bathroom sink and set it on the nightstand. I lay back down, staring at the ceiling, trying to calm myself. The room felt different, like the walls were pressing in on me, the shadows growing darker and more defined. I could feel the weight of something unseen watching me.

When I finally fell asleep, my dreams were dark and unsettling. I was back in the motel room, but everything felt wrong. The walls seemed to move, expanding and contracting like they were breathing, and shadows gathered in the corners, whispering. Figures stood at the edge of the bed, hidden by darkness. I tried to move, but I felt like something was holding me down, a heavy pressure on my chest that made it hard to breathe.

I woke up suddenly, my heart racing. The room was completely dark, and as my eyes adjusted, I saw something that made my blood run cold-long, slender handprints on the outside of the window. A chill went through me, and then I felt it-a cold breath on the back of my neck.

I turned quickly, but there was nothing there. The room was empty, but I felt like I was being watched. I looked at the cup of water on the nightstand-it was empty. My stomach sank. I must have drunk it in my sleep, breaking another rule.

The growl returned, deep and echoing around the room. The shadows gathered again, twisting and shifting into shapes that almost looked like people. My breath caught in my throat, and I shut my eyes, trying to make it all go away. I couldn't help but think, 'This can't be real. Please, let it stop. I can't take this anymore.' The fear was overwhelming, and I felt a desperation I had never known before. The growling got louder, coming from everywhere at once, a horrible, guttural sound that seemed to seep into my very bones.

When I opened my eyes, the figures were there, surrounding the bed, their faces hidden, their dark hands reaching towards me. They were closer now, and I could see the outlines of their forms, the way their fingers seemed to stretch and curl unnaturally.

The figures paused, their hands hovering over me. The shadows seemed to ripple, as if they were deciding what to do. Then, slowly, they began to fade away, dissolving into the darkness. The growling got quieter until the room was silent again. The air was still and cold, and I lay there, shaking, tears in my eyes. I knew I couldn't stay another night-if I did, I was certain that whatever lurked in the shadows would consume me entirely. The feeling of dread was overwhelming, and every instinct in my body screamed that I was in immediate danger, that the next encounter would be my last.

I knew I couldn't stay any longer. After the encounter with the creature, my instinct was to run. I grabbed my things and rushed downstairs, my heart pounding, every step echoing in the silence of the empty motel. I needed to leave-right now. My hands were trembling, and the fear clawed at my chest, making it hard to think clearly.

But when I reached the exit, the door wouldn't budge. I twisted the handle again and again, my panic growing with each failed attempt. It was locked, as if it hadn't been used in years. The windows were boarded up, and the dim light filtering through made everything look even more hopeless. I pounded on the door, my breath coming in short gasps. Panic surged through me, and I turned to see the old man standing behind the front desk, watching me with those tired, emotionless eyes.

"I need to leave," I said, my voice shaky, barely above a whisper. "Let me out. Please."

The old man shook his head slowly, almost sadly. "You can't leave until you've stayed the full nights you paid for," he said, his voice almost apologetic, but there was something cold in his tone, something that made my stomach twist even more.

I felt the walls of the room closing in on me, the heavy silence pressing down, and I wanted to scream. A cold dread settled in my stomach. I realized then that I was trapped. There was no way out until I faced the final night, until I followed every rule perfectly. My eyes darted around the lobby, searching for another exit, a back door, anything that could save me from returning to that cursed room. But there was nothing.

The old man didn't move. He just stood there, staring at me with that hollow gaze. I took a step back, my body trembling, and knew I had no choice. My heart sank as I turned and slowly walked back down the hallway. Every step felt heavier, like I was walking toward my doom. The hallway seemed longer than before, stretching endlessly, the dim lights flickering above me. I could feel tears stinging my eyes, but I blinked them away. I had to do this. I had no choice but to return to Room 7.

On the final night, I knew I had to follow every rule perfectly if I wanted to leave alive. I closed the bathroom door, kept the window shut, put the cup of water on the nightstand, and left a coin on the bedside table. I lay in bed, my eyes wide open, the silence in the room almost unbearable. My body was tense, every muscle tight, as I listened for the first sign of trouble. The air felt thick, as if it was weighing me down, and every sound seemed amplified in the deafening stillness.

At midnight, the knocking started again. It was soft at first, then got louder and more demanding. Each knock seemed to resonate deep in my bones, vibrating through the bedframe. The whispers followed, voices outside the window, growing in number until it sounded like a crowd murmuring just beyond the thin glass. Shadows moved beyond the glass, forming shapes that twisted and writhed. I kept my eyes on the coin, focusing on it as my only connection to reality, trying to block out the chaos around me. The room felt like it was getting darker, the pressure in the air building until I thought I would scream. My chest felt tight, and it was hard to breathe, like the very air was being sucked out of the room.

I felt the mattress dip slightly, as if something had climbed onto the bed. My heart raced, and I clenched my teeth to keep from crying out. I could feel an unnatural coldness spreading from the foot of the bed, moving closer, inch by inch. My entire body was paralyzed with fear, my muscles locked in place as I tried to keep my focus on the coin. The whispers grew louder, more insistent, and I could swear I heard my name being called, mixed in with the voices.

Then, slowly, the darkness began to lift. The whispers got quieter, the knocking stopped, and the shadows faded away. The air felt lighter, and the pressure on my chest slowly began to release. A faint light started to filter through the curtains, and I realized that dawn was breaking.

The sense of relief was overwhelming. I let out a shaky breath and felt tears welling up in my eyes. I had made it. I had survived the final night. My entire body was trembling, but I managed to get out of bed and gather my things. The rules had been followed, and I could feel that whatever haunted Room 7 was letting me go.

I made my way to the front desk, the old man was there, watching me as I approached. He looked tired, but there was a hint of relief in his eyes as well.

"You followed the rules," he said quietly, nodding as I handed him the key.

I nodded back, my voice too shaky to speak. I could barely believe that I was finally leaving. Without another word, I turned and walked out the door, stepping into the early morning light. The fresh air hit my face, and I felt a sense of freedom that I hadn't felt in days.

I got into my car, started the engine, and drove away . As I glanced in the rearview mirror, I watched the old motel grow smaller and smaller until it finally disappeared from view. I knew, deep down, that I would never return to that place. Room 7 was still there, waiting for the next person who wouldn't listen to the warnings and spend the night at the [Silver Rest](https://www.youtube.com/@HerScreams)
