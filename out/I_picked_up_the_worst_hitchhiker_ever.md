Every job has two sets of rules. 

The first set can usually be figured out with a bit of common sense, and when that fails, you can ask Google or some shit. 

But the second set? Well those rules are special. You have to earn the right to hear them. There is no easy way around that. You have to put in your time like the rest of us and eventually one of your seniors will let you in on the hidden knowledge. 

Let me ask you something though. 

Would you still follow the rules if nothing ever happened when you broke them? Would you ever be tempted to see why they exist in the first place? 

I have been a trucker for nearly thirty years. In that span, I have damn near broke every secret rule I was told. I don’t know why. I guess I never cared much for procedure or rules or anything like that. Just give me a two liter of Coke Zero, my truck, and the open road. Anything more than that is just extra bullshit I don’t get paid enough to deal with. 

So yeah, I *did* eat jerky every single time I drove down Road 58. No I never stopped to piss on the Elder Tree on my way to Montana. And you’re damn right I don’t toss a perfectly good pack of cigs out the window at the end of every haul. 

As it turns out though, the rules do exist for a reason. 

I was a fool for ever thinking otherwise. 

It all started with someone banging on my truck door in the early morning. I had gotten absolutely plastered the night before and it was a miracle they were able to wake me up. I shouted something back, can’t remember what. Then I laid there and considered whether I was lonely enough tonight to tousle with some reptiles. 

I stumbled out of bed and pushed the door open. The air was cool against my bare chest. My vision was still a bit blurry but I did manage to say, “listen here Lizzie, I only got forty…” 

Wasn’t Lizzie on the lot. Instead there stood a fella. 

That was a first. 

He was tall and lanky. Bony too. Like he lacked muscle completely and was just skin pulled tightly over bone. Reminded me a tad of those European models I’ve seen on the cover of gas station magazines. He wore one of them bowler hats and altogether was a bit too clean to be any sort of honest man. In his hand he carried a briefcase of fine glossy leather. 

“Aw hell no. Listen fella, I know times are a changin’ and trust me, I support that. But this cowboy prefers roast beef over sausage if you catch my drift.” 

The man chuckled then lifted his hat. His hair was the color of good wheat beneath the midday sun. Wild too. Behind gold spectacles he had bright blue eyes. Calculating, sunken eyes. I figured he was either a cop or one of those car salesmen that gets all giddy at the prospect of fucking a first-time buyer over. 

“Sorry for waking you friend. I tried the other semi trucks before heading over here but no one answered. My name is Samael and I am in a bit of a pickle. I had a, how would you say, falling out with my business partner. We were on a trip to California to conduct some research for our firm. I must say that, unfortunately, our partnership is now dissolved. But I still need to get to California. Would you happen to be on your way there?” 

There were several other truckers parked at the rest stop. Sticklers for the rules to be sure. I chuckled which brought a concerned look to Samael’s face. “I reckon you scared the daylights out of those poor men. In our trade there is a rule about not opening the door between the hours of four and six in the morning in this here lot.” 

“Is this a dangerous area? I thought things looked reasonably safe.” 

“Ever had the soul drained out of you by a she-devil?” I asked solemnly. 

Samael stared at me in shock. I laughed at his unblinking gaze. “Oh. You’re joking with me,” he said. 

“Well it’s a real issue. I suspect that rule was made up to keep these fellas safe from themselves,” I said solemnly. 

I took Samael’s measure in that moment. He seemed like he took himself a bit too seriously and I definitely wasn’t a fan of the fact that he hadn’t blinked once since I first saw him, but I didn’t see him as much of a threat. 

Not then. 

“To answer your question yeah, I am headed to California,” I said after a long silence. “What kinda business are you in?” 

“I am a lawyer. I mainly deal in contracts. It’s my specialty,” he said evenly. 

“A lawyer? Well then why aren’t you flying your pretty ass to LA in first class?” 

“Fly? Me? Certainly not! I have had the worst fear of heights ever since I suffered a particularly nasty fall. No. I am a creature of the road, friend.”

I pretended like I was deep in thought about whether I should bring Samael. I had helped people out before, but ever since a certain incident involving a man who was actually running from the law hitching a ride with me, I have been more hesitant about giving people rides. 

“I am prepared to offer you $1000 dollars for safe passage. $500 up front and the rest once we arrive in California. Additionally, I will pay for your food and drink on the way there.” 

“Make it $1500 and you have a deal.” 

Now it was Samael’s turn to laugh. “$1500 but you need to take me to Los Angeles.” 

I shook his well manicured hand and resisted curling my lips at how soft it was. “Sure. Go ahead and use the restroom and get whatever you need from the gas station over that way. Tell them Mike sent ya. They’ll take care of everything. We leave in two hours. Make sure you are ready.” 

I went back into my truck and tried to sleep. Didn’t work out too well. I had the worst nightmares. They kept forcing me awake every fifteen minutes or so. 

Drenched in sweat with my heart racing at what felt like a hundred miles per hour I decided to get ready, hoping that routine would take my mind elsewhere. 

Outside Samael was staring at something on the ground. Clouds of smoke gathered above his head and dissipated. He turned and looked directly at me. I snorted then finished the last of a lukewarm energy drink from the other day. 

“Shieeet,” I said after joining Samael. Several baby birds, still blue-pink, lay in a pile. 

“Indeed,” said Samael. “What a cruel world.” 

I scratched at my beard. City boys man. “Nothing cruel here I reckon. Just a fact of life.” 

He regarded me coolly, hands clasped behind his back. “You don’t believe in evil?” 

“Nah. I mean it sucks to see a little critter die before it ever gets to fly. But all that talk about good and evil? Well I figure we made it up. Moralized nature to give us some sort of control or power over it. I doubt these birdies were cursing their fate. They felt some cold and some hunger and then…whelp. That was it.” 

Samael didn’t reply. He took another pull on his cigarette. Something in me really didn’t like the way he looked at those birds. 

We got into the truck. Samael had gotten me a bottle of Coke Zero and some Doritos. I thanked him, though he didn’t answer. His eyes were distant and cold. 

As we pulled out from the lot I waved at another trucker who was barely coming out of his vehicle. Poor guy looked terrified. It was either his first time haulin’ or he was coming down from something. 

My new companion didn’t say much as we drove down the highway. Just stared out the window. I felt him staring at me whenever he thought I wasn’t looking though. Definitely an odd fella. 

You’re probably wondering why the hell I allowed him to stay at that point and the truth is, I was lonely. It’s nice to have company beyond the radio on these longer hauls. 

So I didn’t press him on the matter. I pointed out different sights and shared a bit about myself. He didn’t do the same. 

Then, about a few hours into the drive he asked, “do you like being alive?” 

I gave him a look. The fuck kinda question was that? “Sure buddy. I do. Football, fajitas, and fucking. In that order too. Those are what make life worth living for me. What about you? I’m guessing either those nature documentaries where the zebras get ate by lions or leaked footage from battlefields?” I laughed in his face. “Is that what makes you tick?” 

Samael pursed his full lips. “I enjoy reading IRS tax publications. I also enjoy hunting. But most of my time is spent working.” 

Christ Almighty. “Well that’s interesting. So why are you headed over to Los Angeles? What big business are you looking to break into over there?” 

“Have you been watching the news?” 

“Not really,” I said. 

Samael smiled. “Can I confess something to you?” 

“Go for it.” 

“I asked whether you enjoyed your life because I am quite dissatisfied with my own.”

I shrugged. “Well that happens. That feeling won’t  last forever though. Nothing does.”  

“I think my life would be a whole lot better if nobody else existed. I could enjoy a land of silence. Be at peace. Imagine, if you will, a world of infinite space. No obstructions. Utter flatness.”  

“Sounds like you want a whole lot of nothing,” I said. 

“Yes,” Samael whispered. “Nothing.” 

I merged over into the middle lane and did my best to ignore him for the rest of the drive. He got more blatant with his staring, but I didn’t give him the reaction he was looking for. 

You meet a lot of unsavory characters in this line of work. Comes with the territory. There are two kinds of people who seek solitude after all. Mystics and Devils. Never forget the latter vastly outweigh the former. 

We stopped for the evening then headed over to a diner. As we neared, a shaggy dog with a bloom of silver around his muzzle pattered over to me. 

“Don’t pet it. It’s filthy,” Samael said. 

“Go on and get us a table. You’re scaring the dog,” I replied. 

I heard the door open and slam shut behind me. I shook my head and proceeded to scratch behind the shaggy dog’s ears. Then I fed him a bit of jerky from my pocket. “Good luck out there old man. Yeah I know you’re capable. I meant no offense. But old guys like us need it,” I told the dog. He licked my hand before trotting away. 

Samael didn’t look up from his menu — he only asked whether I had washed my hands. I ignored him. The lovely waitress came to our table a few minutes later, took our orders, and that was that. 

After she brought our food Samael leaned over and asked, “are you ignoring me?” 

“Yeah. Now shut the fuck up and eat your food.” 

I saw the man bristle at that. But he stayed quiet. He stayed quiet and he stared. 

I excused myself and went over to the restroom. I decided to take my sweet time as it was gonna be a long ride with that weirdo. Then, while I was finishing up I heard a commotion outside. 

The waitress from earlier was crying and repeating over and over that she didn’t know how Samael’s wallet ended up in her apron. Samael stood there with his arms crossed shaking his head. 

“I am sorry sir. Truly. I don’t want any trouble,” said Jeb, the man who owned the diner. 

Samael stepped closer and jabbed his finger into Jeb’s chest. “That bitch stole my wallet. I had over two grand in there. That is a felony sir. I want her fired and gone.” 

Jeb looked at the waitress sheepishly. Her eyes were wild and she was tugging at her hair. “Jeb please, I didn’t do it. You know me. Please Jeb I have kids to feed.” 

“Then how did it get there Patty?” Jeb asked. 

“What’s going on here?” I said, not able to stand it any longer. 

Samael grinned. “I caught a criminal in the act. Who knows what else she’s stolen.” 

Jeb threw his hands up into the air. “Okay okay. Becky. I’m sorry but we caught you red handed. You’re fired. Now get out of here before the kind lawyer here presses charges.” He turned to Samael, shoulders hunched. “Please sir. We don’t have a whole lot of money. You wouldn’t get much out of suing us.” 

These were simple folk Samael was bullying. They didn’t know any thing about the law. “Let’s get out of here Samael,” I grunted. 

He followed behind me so close I felt his breath against my neck. Then, when we were outside and far enough away from the diner he said something that made me freeze in place. 

“And that is how you get a free meal.” 

I slowly turned around. Samael stood there tall and dark with the desert behind him. He was smiling so wide his face practically contorted. 

“The hell did you say,” I gasped, so angry I could hardly speak. 

“I slipped the wallet into her apron while she refilled your coffee,” he said gleefully. Those blue eyes of his were glowing like embers. 

I felt a chill run down my spine. “She had kids to feed man. You got her fired over twenty dollars? Are you out of your god damn mind?” 

“Oh Michael. You have no idea,” he growled. There was something feral in the cast of his face now. Something hungry. He took a step towards me. 

I clenched my fists and squared up to him. “You and I are done. Find a different way to California you son of a bitch.” 

“We had a deal,” Samael said. 

“Oh really?” I raised an eyebrow, then spit at his feet. “I would have thought a fancy lawyer like you would have gotten that deal down in writing. So please, produce it. Oh, you don’t have it? Well I suppose that doesn’t matter since you broke the terms. You see, *you* were supposed to pay for my food and drink per our agreement. You went back on that the moment you forced those poor folks back there to pay for our food.” 

Samael’s lips peeled back and I saw row upon row of  pointed teeth spinning in place within that wide mouth. “This is a bad idea. You don’t got the wit you think.” 

I laughed while waving him goodbye. But secretly I was terrified of that man. I knew what he was now.

He watched me as I got into my truck. I felt him watching even after I was safely inside. I didn’t know why until I found the surprise he left for me on my bed. I don’t think I have screamed like that since I was a boy. I grabbed a towel, threw it over his sick gift, and drove away as fast as I could. 

I would like to say my encounter with Samael ended there, but it didn’t. I see him now every time I pass through a crossroads. He smiles and holds up his briefcase as I drive past. 

I can’t stop for too long anymore either because I can hear him knocking on the door at night, asking where the shaggy dog is. Then I hear him laughing which turns into barking exactly like that poor animal did, and all I can do at that moment is pray for someone to save me. 

All I can say is if you’re gonna break the rules, make sure they are the right ones.
