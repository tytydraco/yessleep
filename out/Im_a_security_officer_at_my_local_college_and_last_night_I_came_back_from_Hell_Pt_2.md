October 16, 4:50am 

I felt my throat tense and my stomach bubble as I held back vomit. I covered my hand over my face, but it was no use. It sprayed out in between my fingers and projected onto the floor, my clothes, and the book that I had been holding prior to meeting that thing. I picked up the book, and clumps of what used to be my microwave steak splat onto the floor. I’m not sure why I needed the book, but I felt like it was very important to keep it close. 

I proceeded to gather myself and steadily get up like a fawn learning to walk the first time. Slumping back to the entrance of the library, I felt that behind the black windows something seemed to be watching me. I picked up the pace, tripping over my own feet, my legs feeling like they were filled with stones. I only stopped when I saw him. 

There was a man; he had a light brown combover and was wearing a navy blue suit, his back facing towards me as he crouched over the floor, moaning in pain the words “help me” over and over to himself. I cried out, “Sir? How’d you get in here, are you alright?”. Without a word, he stands, and I know that this man is no longer human. As he rises, his ginormous stature comes into view as his bones crack and mangle to life. His spine was visible through the back of his suit, and his legs were each about 4 feet tall. His arms extended from the bottom of his neck downward all the way to his ankles. He turned to me, having to bend his neck sideways to avoid the ceiling. He opened his mouth, his jaw hanging low as he raged the words “I KNOW WHAT YOU’VE DONE.”.

I tried to turn and run, but he caught me by the ankle, his claws sinking into my flesh like a hot knife through butter. The initial pressure was a sickening sensation, a slow, deliberate tearing that allowed me to feel each jagged edge slice into my skin, carving through muscle and tendon, inching ever closer to the bone. Then, as my screams echoed in the darkness, he ramped up the pace, raking his nails against my bare, exposed bone with a horrific scrape that sent waves of agony through my body. My insides were exposed to the dirty air that this creature inhabited. 

I looked down, my mind spiraling into shock as the world around me blurred into a haze of crimson. The sight of my mangled foot was surreal—skin hanging in tatters, blood pooling and dripping like a grotesque painting. The pain was a haunting melody, but it was his smile that chilled me to the core—a twisted grin that revealed a sadistic pleasure in my suffering. He began to drag me down the staircase, each jarring pull sending fresh agony coursing through me, the raw flesh of my ankle tearing further as he reveled in my torment. 

I woke up in what I assume used to be a private study room for students. The room’s light was off with dim flashes from heat lighting through the door’s small window every so often, giving me a second of clarity. I was bound, my arms shackled to hooks dangling from the ceiling, and my legs spread outward extended by rope, with the right leg bound around the thigh due to my foot being completely pulled apart. I could hear a voice murmur from the room next to me, followed by clanking sounds of metal, screaming, then silence. My nose was filled with the smell of roadkill and lead, and my mouth tasted like vomit. The door creaked open slowly as long arms emerged from the darkness, and I knew it was the man once again. He crawled his way through the door like a large spider trying to fit into a pinhole. Once in, he took up most of the room, and with his head over me, a hot breath of death billowed over my face. “Welcome to the basement.”
