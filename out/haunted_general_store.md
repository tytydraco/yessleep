Hi. I'm looking for some advice.  A few years ago i started working at a haunted general store.  It's really crazy there and it's like yeah, the door's right there, but cmon man how cool is that.  i mean it's psychically painful and shit like that but it's a good learning experience. so many vibes there. 

uh, there's some ghosts around but they're not too bad just float around and shit. my coworkers are there for the same reasons as me as far as i can tell.  anyway something really weird happened where people started gossiping about me when i went to the bathroom because one of the ghost managers started talking shit about me.  but actually i have a haunted spine! meaning i had spinal surgery.  so my dick is half broke and i think that's kinda fucked up because it takes me half an hour to pee sometimes for real.  sucks.

anyway no one addressed it and everyone moved on and here i am picking up the pieces of my rep that i'd been building. it's in a nice school district so most of the employees are ambitious and have their shit together. i only recently got my shit together but i have the wisdom of many years worth of fucking up and it was nice to find some people that age who were competent and interested and curious.  at one point there was a psychic invasion from the lands way down south and i was somehow able to idk hang around and try to keep up the vibe as much as possible and make sure not too many people come through because of the psychic plague.

i think it has something to do with the fact that i'm a buddhist but i don't advertise it because why would i.  like, i'm working a counter in a store that's already haunted and then there's also this psychic invasion like that's a lot of stress for me no less a high schooler.  and if just being chill and snarky and vaguely witchy and talking shit and checking in with people and being emotionally accountable makes me bad then fuck off. 

oh i should clarify that the reason that this is a big deal is because i'm an early 30s male presenting nb and i'm queer as shit because of my background and what everyone else saw was some slob moving in and talking to a group of four teenage girls.  but wow did you notice that i wasn't hitting on them?  did you pay a single fucking ounce of attention to the emotional tenor of the situation.

anyway i'd consider these people to be fellow witches on the same path as me and i feel a lot of loyalty to them because we were doing a menial job during an emotionally stressful time and i don't know if they feel the same way but i feel like we low key trauma bonded without exchanging more than like 200 words the whole time.  nice feeling actually and i'm not conflicted about it because, and i cannot clarify this enough, i do not have anime brain.  

i did catch a lot of flak though in the forms of hexes, curses, various palls and and such from the community.  rough! someone put up an employee survey sheet for people to fuck around on and i used ironically and unironically to indicate the condition of my spinal cord.  and wow wouldn't you know it it turns out that nobody learns about how spines work isn't that crazy.  chronic pain means that if too much shit goes wrong i get fucking lightning bolts up and down my left leg.  not awesome.  can barely walk.  but that's not all the time and most of the time i can do shit just fine it's just sometimes i need to rest for a few minutes or a few days how the fuck can you refuse to acknowledge that anyway i digress.

the reason i'm posting is because it seems that some unknown force, perhaps originating from within the store itself, is creating a pall of silence over me such that i can't discuss the situation in plain terms with anyone real.  i find it quite unpleasant to be unable to speak with people who i have such mutual respect for and who form part of a group i consider myself to be a part of.  i didn't sign on to manage anyone and guess what i wasn't.  i was just being a good coworker.  imagine that.  fuck you.
