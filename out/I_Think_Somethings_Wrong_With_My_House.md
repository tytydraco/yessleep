I didn't live in a very nice household. Okay, well, it was nice and all, it was a big estate, but it wasn't... nice. 

My dad was angry. My mom was angry. My brother was angry. Basically, everyone was angry all the time every day. If I wasn't getting empty beer cans thrown at me by my dad, I was getting my toys broken by my mom, and if I wasn't getting either of that done to me, I was just plain getting beaten up by my brother. Sibling love and all that.

Needless to say, I spent a bunch of time hiding in various places around the house. So naturally, I found some weird shit. 

It's worth mentioning the house we lived in. It was old. Like, it had been in our family since America became a country. My whatever-great-grandpa on my father's side was a pretty wealthy Englishman, and built it way back in the 1700s. It had been owned by my paternal family ever since. So yeah, it was pretty fucking creepy. 

A lot of it can be explained, and a lot of it can't. 

The big "unexplained" happened when I was ten. 

My brother, Todd, was just about to turn eighteen. In my family, that means getting the house. The oldest son would always inherit the estate when he turned eighteen. That's just how it went. 

Todd was already planning all of the grand things he'd do with the estate. My parents would move into a smaller condo closer to the center of town, since they were already ramping up for retirement. And what were they planning on doing with me, their ten-year-old child? Well, it was up to Todd. And Todd was a dick. So he decided to move me to the old servant's quarters, on the edge of the property.

I tried debating it, but you can probably guess how that went. So, I was hiding in my most recent hiding spot, the basement linen closet, black eye and shattered lip, when I heard it.

A creak.

Wasn't too out of the ordinary, the house was almost 300 years old, but something about it felt off. Deliberate. Like those cartoons when the character is trying to sneak around. I carefully opened the closet door just enough to be able to peep out with one eye. What I saw made me stay in the closet until morning. 

It was another eye, poking out back at me. It was watching me, too. I couldn't make out the details, I was too panicked, but I remember how cloudy they looked. Almost inhuman. 

I leaned all my weight against the door, trying to hold it shut just in case it tried to open the door. It didn't, but for the rest of the night, it knocked. And knocked. The weird thing is, sometimes the knocks weren't coming from the door. Sometimes it was behind me, sometimes it was farther away. And it was fast and heavy. Didn't even seem like knocking.

I don't remember when I fell asleep, but I must've at some point because I woke up to Todd.

"Tim, wake up dipshit, and get out of the fucking closet, gay bitch!" He said, forever the clever artist of words. 

As I opened the closet door, I noticed things were kind of off. Nothing super out of the ordinary, just...off. Like the air was heavier. As I closed the door, I realized why things felt weird. 

The door was practically shredded to pieces. It was trying to get in. 

That day, I did what I rarely ever did. Stayed with my family all day. It was hard to endure, but not as bad as whatever the fuck happened last night. Still, night had to come, and I eventually was alone in my room, trying to fall asleep. 

Then I heard it again. A fucking creak. This time, from my own closet. I woke up, and peeked my head out from under the covers, still traumatized from last night.

Nothing. No eye.

But then, I looked a little longer. No, nobody was staring me down, but somebody was there. 

My closet. 

He looked tall. Too tall. His neck was the worst part. Bent where it shouldn't be, looking almost like a snake. I stared at the tall man, too terrified to move, when I realized he really wasn't that tall afterwards. I was just looking at him wrong. His grey, rotting feet were lifted off the ground. This really was a ghost. 

Then it... he? Opened his mouth. He looked like he was trying to tell me something. He kept choking over his words. I guess eventually he got so frustrated, he just let out the worst sound I've ever heard. The most disgusting, visceral scream I think I'll ever be privy to in my life. He suddenly thrust towards me, and I finally got control over my body and ducked under my covers until the next day. 

I saw things like that for the next few days. Maybe it was a gaunt, hairless creature staring at me through my third story window, or maybe it was a woman with matted hair and blood around her mouth I saw in the kitchen out of the corner of my eye. But something was always watching me. 

Eventually, I felt like I was going crazy. So crazy, I did something I never thought I'd do.

I was in my room, when suddenly, I saw the creepy neck guy from my closet again. I tried to ignore him, but he got so close I could feel his energy sucking the life out of me. I turned around and snapped, "What?! What do you want!?" 

Then, he backed up. He floated to my door, entering the hallway. As he went, he turned around and motioned for me to follow with a bony, long finger. And not knowing quite why, I decided to follow him. Maybe I was out of options or something. I followed him, all the way back to the basement, which I hadn't been in since the incident in the linen closet. 

And he showed me something I never thought I'd find; a section of my house I hadn't found yet. 

It was a secret hatch. He used his long finger as a key to open it, which I thought was gross, but didn't say so because I thought I'd be rude. Then, he motioned for me to go in. Hesitantly, I entered the secret room.

Documents. Boring. But, ten-year-old me knew well enough that if a monster shows you something, it's probably important. 

The paper was delicate, but I still read it as carefully as I could. 

My relatives had a...deal of sorts. I still can't quite understand it. All I know is, there's a reason my family has stayed so wealthy this long, and it wasn't because we were financially smart. 

It came at a cost, though. 

Turns out, the estate wasn't going to the eldest son. It was going to the son that survived. 

Wealth, the papers said, came with consequences. Wealth wants bodies. 

Maybe it was an unfortunate tumble down the stairs. 

 *And it was fast and heavy. Didn't even seem like knocking.*

Maybe it was an untimely suicide in his own bedroom.

*His neck was the worst part. Bent where it shouldn't be, looking almost like a snake.* 

Maybe he mysteriously fell out of the window. 

 *It was a gaunt, hairless creature staring at me through my third story window,* 

Maybe she suddenly fell ill after eating a special cake her father made just for her. 

 *It was a woman with matted hair and blood around her mouth I saw in the kitchen out of the corner of my eye.*

No matter what, the youngest member of the family would always end up... disappearing. No evidence of them even existing, other than these papers. I looked up, horrified. I was the youngest member of my family. Was I born, just for this? So my family could keep their wealth? 

As I looked up, I saw all of them. They all stared at me, and while I used to be scared of them, as I looked into their gaunt, cloudy and dark eyes, all I could see was me. This was my family. I had to save them. 

The woman with blood around her mouth gave me a shovel and pointed to the door that went outside. Was that where they were? Still, I knew what I had to do. 

It took a lot of time-the outside of my house was big after all, but I knew I didn't have a lot of time. Todd was turning eighteen in two days, so it was just a race against the clock. The sheer determination, and fear, I had motivated me, and eventually I found it. I found them. 

A mass grave, no doubt where I would've been if I hadn't acted when I did. Skeletons of my family. Just piled there like nothing. I looked behind me. They were all staring at me, their kind-of-scary-but-also-sad eyes looking hopeful. One by one, I recovered their skulls. It took a while, but I returned them all to the rightful owners. 

Slowly, I watched as they changed right in front of me. Their necks were less bent, their hair was less matted, their eyes were less dead. Like a piece of history right in front of me. They were at peace.

"Is this it?" I asked. "You guys can go now? I saved you." 

The one whose neck used to be bent but was now back to a more respectable angle, smiled. It looked like my own smile. "Not all of us are saved, young Timothy. There is one youngest child left to be saved." He said, finally able to speak.  

"We'll handle this, little one." The lady said, and I watched as they floated towards my house, where Todd and my parents were in the dining room, making plans for when Todd inherited the house. 

I don't know what they did to them. I do know that I never saw them again. I should've been sad, my whole family was gone. But I wasn't. Something in me felt free.



Now, I've truly gotten to know every inch of my house now. It hasn't changed much since my childhood-if anything, I've changed. I'm no longer scared of the things that go bump in the night. I know it's just my great aunts and uncles saying hi.
