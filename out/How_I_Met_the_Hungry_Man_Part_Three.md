[I remember my grandad's stories ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nxrpj4/how_i_met_the_hungry_man_part_two/)always started with a "Kiddo", every story. Even when there was a history lesson or something tied into it, I remember the time he said "Kiddo, when the Great Famine occurred in Ireland, it was known as 'An Gorta Mór' - The Great Hunger. Even then we knew it wasn't a famine, it was institutionalised murder, a slow genocide that lined the pockets of the wealthy, and bled the stomachs of the poor. You'll know the meaning of them words when you're older. Nowhere was this more true than the rural areas. One day, a Lord in his carriage left his estate to look upon a field which he intended to buy to allow his cattle to graze on. This field overlooked the ocean, and upon the hillock, if the weather permitted it, one could see the sun shimmering upon the sea.  He had left early in the morning, for the field was a distance from his abode, and it was upon this long journey, with the bumps of the road rocking him to sleep as his long-since dead mother once done, did the Lord fall to sleep. He dreamt of his wife, of his loving daughters, he dreamt of the day he could lunch with them upon that grassy hillock and watch his family create memories that would last longer than he. It was from such joyous dreams that the Lord was awoken.

"Pray, move thine wretched self from the path" spoke his carriage driver.

Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, the Lord dismounted the carriage, so he may inspect the issue at hand.

Seeing his Lord presently before him the driver spoke "Heed not this obstruction" he dismounted with a grunt, the carriage bouncing back with it's new found relief "I shall move him presently"

The obstruction was a malnourished boy, of no more years than his sixteenth. His skin was pulled drum-tight over his skeleton, so that his eyes hung like two gigantic orbs in his gaunt face.

"Why is it that thine muzzle is green?" The Lord asked angrily "And why is it that you delay me, when mine field is so nearby?"

His voice was raspy, and hard to hear, but through great strain, the poor youth replied "tis not mine intention to delay you Lord" he coughed "tis only that I may reach the other side of this road, so that I may rest upright against the wall and gaze upon the hillock thither" At this his finger, long, knurly and thin, pointed to a field which the Lord immediately recognised as his own.

"Then lift and conduct yourself to it" The Lord, at this, indicated to his carriage driver to return to his seat. "I will allow you to look upon mine field"

The youth rose slightly as if to begin his journey once more, but slumped under the effort "Tis not yours"

The Lord, stunned, asked the youth to repeat himself

"Tis not yours, I say" The youth once more lifted himself to a crawling position, and with great stress, began to move toward the low stone wall that sat opposite him.

The Lord grew in anger "Tis not mine? Well tis yours then I suppose?" The Lord began to thread back and forth "Hear ye this Michael?" he shouted after his driver who had returned to his seat "The youth owns mine field"

The carriage driver smirked.

"Tis his land" The Lord continued "As is the field beyond that, and the field beyond that, and the sea beyond that" The Lord was frothing at the mouth "Well then, allow me, oh Lord of all Lands to assist you to thine stone throne"

He drove his leather boot into the Youth's rear, driving the frail man forward.

"Across *your* road sire" Again he drove his boot. Again, and again.

The youth had reached the stone wall, and as he curled to protect himself, the Lord launched more and more kicks at the youth. His fragile bones cracking being the only noise in the deathly still countryside.

When the beating had stopped, and the Lord and his carriage had rode into the near distance, the Youth spilled blood from his green-dyed mouth. He lay there, among the long grasses and in his dying breath he whispered to the soaking sod, praying for strength: ""Mo shaol, críochnaithe""

The grass listened, and as the years moved on and that ditch was bought and destroyed by the very same lord, he had been out inspecting the expanding of his wealth, when as he was returning to his lunching family, he tripped over seemingly nothing and fell flat on the ground. The calamity inspired laughter from his young daughters and wife. Yet he didn't rise, nor did he stir.

"Jane" the mother lowered herself, a smile adorning her porcelain face "Tell Daddy to stop acting the fool, and to join us"

Jane's smile had been missing teeth, yet she beamed with the sheer happiness she had for that splendid day. "Silly Daddy" she replied to her mother with a giggle.

Jane rose to her full stature, watching her the curls of her youngest, the apple of her Lord father's eye,  bounce merrily into the distance. Her eldest clung to her mother's dress, only looking up when her mother caressed her flawless cheek. She had her father's eyes, but the rest of her was the image of her mother. Blonde hair, thin lips, shy. She was deep in these thoughts, an intense silence had consumed her, she hadn't heard Jane's horrific screams, her attention only brought to them by the frantic tugging her firstborn had made on her dress.

Jane's mother, when the world's music returned, sprinted toward the banshee wails of her youngest.

When she got closer to her daughter, whom retreated to the sanctuary of her mother's hem, she screamed at the face that looked back at her, her husband's head faced the sky where his chest faced the ground. A thousand cuts from blades of grass sliced onto his gruesome expression."

"Happy to be going home?"

"Definitely" Grandad replied with a sigh of relief "I just wish it was today rather than tomorrow"

"I'm just glad that Mum was able to convince you to stay a while longer"

"As much as I hate to agree, I do." He conceded "I feel better"

I smiled and stretched forward to hold his hand.

His smile was momentary, but there was a certain level of pride in it. "I love you kiddo, you know that don't you?"

I felt a lump rise in my throat, hearing his voice, weak and aged, say something like that  made my voice tremble "I love you too"

He beamed "Do me a favour?"

"Of course" I choked the lump in my throat

"Will you collect me from here tomorrow? I just feel like" he paused, a look of hesitation came over his face "I don't want to stress your mother anymore than I already have."

"I understand"

"and, eh.." he looked away from me "How's your dad?"

"He says that you still have fight in you" I laughed

Grandad chuckled "that I do! I prayed enough for it" he looked back at me "So you promise you'll come to lift me tomorrow?"

"I will"

"Okay, get going" he smiled and theatrically taking his hand from mine "Young men should spend so much time with old ones, you'll get my habits!"

I departed in a good mood, such a good mood in fact that on the way home, I decided I'd tell Mum and Dad the truth. That I was failing college, and that I didn't mind leaving and working in the bar full time. I could help out, take the even a little bit of the stress away from them. Maybe now that Grandad was getting out, Mum might begin to feel better. Stronger.

The porch creaked beneath my feet, and as the door swung open, I was welcomed by the smell of Dad's cooking and Mum writing furiously in a small book she had started recording how she felt. Mum looked up with a smile, and Dad rose a hand without turning back. My confidence of telling them drained as I seen a moment I didn't want to destroy. Over dinner, we talked like a united family for the first time in a long time. Dad and Mum laughed like the used to, when he still had his office job, and Mum hadn't that scar on her wrist.

"I have an idea" Dad rose, pushing his plate away from himself. "I'll be back in a moment" that being said he darted outside.

Mum smiled after him "He's happier with a bruised nose isn't he?"

I chuckled "he seems to be"

"Did Grandad ask about him?"

"He did, I told him he is over it and holds no grudges"

"I'm so gla-"

"Look what papa has" Dad twirled his way in, a bottle of vodka swishing in his hand.

Mum clapped her hands together "Where did you find that?"

"Your dad" he looked at Mum with a faux shock.

"How?" I wondered aloud.

"He rang me from the hospital this morning, and told me that he wanted to make amends" he danced his way to the cupboard and produced three glasses, pouring an equal amount into each glass "told me he had asked that nurse that Jamie likes to go out and get him a bottle of vodka so that he could give it to me as a peace offering"

I blushed, making my mother laugh "When did you go to see him?"

"Well" he paused "I didn't"

"What?" Mum asked her smile having a hint of worry to it.

"He said that that nurse, what's her name Jamie?"

"Gabrielle"

"Right Gabrielle. Well he said that she was afraid of sneaking alcohol into the hospital in case she was caught and fired. So as a compromise she left in a bush outside the entrance."

It was my turn to laugh "So we are drinking bush vodka? Just hoping that no one pissed in a bottle and threw it into the same shrubbery?"

Dad shrugged "Kinda" he brought the glass to his mouth"...at least it smells like vodka though"

So that's how we spent the evening, I drank four shots of the stuff before I began to feel like sleeping, and after the sixth one I decided upon going to bed, wishing both my parents a goodnight, as the decided to stay awake and kill the bottle entirely.

I don't remember falling asleep. In fact I don't remember getting as far as my room. The next thing I remember was being shaken awake.

"Kiddo?"

My eyes opened to a churning world, one where the ground I lay upon seemed to swirl.

"Kiddo?" the voice repeated.

"Grandad?"

"Get up, son"

He hooked me beneath my arm, even in my groggy state I was surprised at his sudden strength. On my feet, I was surprised to see the house in darkness, I turned to see my grandfather.

He wore his hospital gown, over which was a jacket of my father's, behind him, at the end of the hallway my mother and father lay asleep at the kitchen table.

"Granda? Why are you here?" my panic began to overwhelm my disorientation "What happened them?"

He placed a finger on his lips "Come with me now" his voice was demanding even in a hushed voice.

"No" I shook his arms "Tell me what happened"

"Come with me" he stared before speaking loudly "NOW"

I admit that I was frightened. I admit that I followed him because I was cowardly. Regardless of why I followed him, I did.

"Get in the car" he spoke with determination.

"Grandad what is happening?"

He took from his jacket a scalpel "Get in the car Jamie"

I froze "Grandad" I stared at the glint the blade had in the moonlight "What is happening?"

"Jamie" he pointed the blade toward me "Get in the driver seat, and just do as I say"
