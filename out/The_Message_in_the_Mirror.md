It all started with a mirror. I’d just moved into a new apartment, an old Victorian house that had been divided into several units. The place was charming, if a bit eerie, with its creaky wooden floors and winding hallways. But the most peculiar thing was the mirror in the bathroom—a large, ornate piece with intricate carvings and a heavy gold frame.

I remember the day I first noticed it. I was unpacking my things, trying to make the space feel more like home. The mirror was covered in dust, its surface dark and cloudy. I decided to clean it, thinking it would brighten up the small, dimly lit bathroom.

As I polished the glass, I noticed something odd. There was a faint smudge on the mirror’s surface that wouldn’t come off. I assumed it was just stubborn dirt and continued cleaning. That’s when I saw it—an inscription, faint but legible, scrawled in what looked like dried blood.

The message read: "HELP ME."

I laughed it off, convincing myself it was probably just a prank from the previous tenant. But as the days went by, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. Every time I looked into that mirror, I felt a chill, as if I were being watched.

One night, I was jolted awake by a loud crash. My heart raced as I stumbled out of bed and into the bathroom. The mirror was shattered on the floor. I looked around, but there was no sign of anyone else in the apartment. I swept up the glass, trying to ignore the creeping sense of dread.

The following morning, I decided to replace the mirror. I went to a local antique shop and found a beautiful, vintage piece that seemed to fit the apartment’s character. As I hung it in the bathroom, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of relief. Maybe a new mirror would dispel the unease.

But the new mirror didn’t bring any comfort. If anything, it made things worse. The strange feeling of being watched intensified. I began to notice odd things happening: objects moving on their own, strange noises in the middle of the night, and a persistent, unexplained cold spot in the bathroom.

One evening, I was reading in the living room when I heard a whisper coming from the bathroom. I couldn’t make out the words, but the tone was pleading. I tried to ignore it, attributing it to my imagination, but the whispers grew louder and more insistent.

That’s when I decided to investigate. I placed a recorder in the bathroom, hoping to capture any unusual sounds. When I played back the recording, I was horrified. The whispers were unmistakable, and they were saying, "Please, help me. He’s coming."

I tried to find out more about the apartment’s history, but there were no records or mentions of anything unusual. It was as if the place had been wiped clean. My neighbors were equally unhelpful, either avoiding the topic or giving vague, unsettling answers.

Determined to uncover the truth, I did some research on the mirror. I discovered it was part of a set that had been sold at an estate sale several decades ago. The original owner, a woman named Eliza Blackwood, had died under mysterious circumstances. There were rumors that she had been involved in dark rituals and that her spirit had been trapped in the mirrors she owned.

The more I learned, the more convinced I became that something sinister was happening. I tried to remove the mirror, but it was as if it was glued to the wall. The whispering grew louder, and the cold spot became unbearable. I could see my breath in the bathroom even though the rest of the apartment was warm.

Desperate, I contacted a local paranormal investigator. They came over, set up their equipment, and performed a cleansing ritual. During the ritual, the temperature in the room dropped drastically, and the investigators reported seeing shadowy figures moving around.

After the cleansing, the activity seemed to lessen. The whispers stopped, and the cold spot disappeared. But I still couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me. The mirror remained, though now it seemed just a regular, old piece of glass.

I’m not sure what happened in that bathroom. Whether it was a trick of the mind, a malevolent spirit, or something else entirely, I can’t say for certain. All I know is that I’m moving out. The mirror will stay, and with it, the mystery that I can’t seem to unravel.

If you ever find yourself in an old Victorian house with a strange mirror, maybe think twice before cleaning it. Some messages are better left unread.
