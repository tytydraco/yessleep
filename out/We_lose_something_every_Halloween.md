I looked up from Janet to Bryan with a put-upon expression I didn’t feel.  “Bry, you really have spoiled your daughter, you know that?”

 

He grinned back.  “Me?  It’s her favorite aunt that’s spoiled her.  She won’t go trick-or-treating without hearing the story.”  My brother glanced toward the dimming light coming through a nearby window.  “And you better hurry.  It’s getting dark, and if we aren’t on the road soon, all the best candy will be gone.”

 

I let out a long-suffering sigh, rolling my eyes before looking down and beaming at the demanding bumblebee sitting between us on the floor with her empty jack o’lantern bucket.  “Fine, fine.  It seems I’m being held hostage.  So I’ll tell you the story.”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

When we were just a bit younger than you, I loved Halloween and your father hated it.  I didn’t understand why when we were smaller, but by the time I was seven I’d started to figure it out.  He was always sick after Halloween, after all, and for weeks afterward he’d have a limp.   The last couple of years he hadn’t even wanted to go trick-or-treating with me and Dad, and by the time we got home, he was already locked away in his room.

 

Because your father and I, despite being only a year apart and loving each other very much, lived very different lives.  We had separate rooms, and while we spent a lot of time together, looking back, there were also times when he wasn’t around.  It was like I had a good and pleasant childhood with kind, loving parents, but sometimes I was an only child.  And then Bryan would be back—back from being sick, or running away, or some other thing that I didn’t understand.  I always missed him, but I never thought it was that strange, as that’s the way it had always been.

 

But then, just a few weeks before my seventh and his eighth Halloween, I saw your father’s feet for the first time.  He always had on shoes or thick socks around me, you understand, and if he tried to take them off, he was strictly punished.  I’d always thought that was weird, had asked questions about it, but our parents said it was for his protection, that he was sensitive and had delicate feet. 

 

When I caught a glimpse of them that day in September, just for a second through a neglected crack his bedroom door, I realized that his feet looked much different than mine.  I had ten toes, but most of his were gone.  It worried me in a way I didn’t fully understand at the time—enough that I asked him about it a few days later when we had a moment alone.

 

He told me that he lost a toe every Halloween, that we had to lose something every Halloween, give up something to the thing that haunted our family.  To keep our family safe.  Your father immediately saw how much this scared and upset me, and like always, he tried to make it better.  He told me that it was okay.  He was proud to do it so I didn’t have to, so our parents didn’t have to.  That they always numbed up his foot good and cut it off clean.  It barely hurt at all, and our parents took real good care of him.

 

Our father was a doctor—our doctor, in fact.  So I didn’t doubt they could do it well enough.  But now I knew why Bryan walked wobbly and couldn’t run.  And why he was always so sick around Halloween.

 

I told him that was bad, that we should stop it.  He told me no.  That there was something even worse after us all, and the only way to keep it away was to give it something every year.  The jack o’lanterns that we always carefully carved and set on the porch before the sun set those nights?  By midnight they had one of your father’s toes in there next to the candle.  And by the next morning?  It was always gone.

 

Bryan would check, you see.  He’d doubted if this was all real, especially when he was the one having toes cut off, and he wanted some proof that this was all really necessary.  So the last couple of years, he’d checked the pumpkins the next morning.  Other than a bit of drying blood and a burned out candle, there was nothing left.

 

Still, I kept pressing.  What if our parents were crazy?  Or if there was some other way?  We were home schooled and somewhat isolated, but we weren’t stupid or completely insulated from newspapers or television.  A monster stealing children’s toes made no sense, but cruel, even insane parents?  That did happen from time to time.

 

Even now, I remember how angry and afraid I was.  I loved your father more than anything, and the idea of him being hurt…I couldn’t stand it.  He was the only thing that stopped me from running away or calling someone for help.  He said that he knew it was necessary, that our parents wouldn’t do it otherwise.  That they didn’t act crazy or mean, even when they took his toes.  They acted like they felt bad about it even, told him how sorry they were and how brave and good he was for doing it.

 

When he saw I still wasn’t convinced or satisfied, he promised that this Halloween he would stay up all night and watch the porch.  His room faced the front of the house, after all, so he had an ideal spot to see if anything came to take the toe.  If he hadn’t seen something come take it by morning, or if our parents just came back and took it back out themselves, he’d go along with whatever I wanted to do.

 

I didn’t like it, especially since it would mean him losing another toe, but I was so confused and terrified that I just felt kind of numb.  I think I even blocked it out until a couple of days before Halloween, when my stomach started hurting.

 

I tried to say I was sick so I didn’t have to go trick-or-treating, thinking desperately that maybe if I stayed home they wouldn’t take his toe, though I should have realized that up until the last couple of years they’d been doing it after we both went trick-or-treating with our father. 

 

Either way, my father knew I wasn’t sick and he made me go out with him anyway.  When we got back, Bryan was already locked away in his bedroom.  It wasn’t until two days later that he was “well” enough to come out again, and I could tell he looked pale and shaken.  Whispering to him while we watched t.v., I asked if he was okay.

 

He glanced at our mother on the sofa before giving a small, brief nod.

 

“Did you see it?  Did you see something come and take your toe?”

 

Your father seemed to grow paler, and I saw a slight tremble in his shoulders.  After a moment of hesitation, he gave another quick nod.

 

I could feel myself starting to shake a little by then.  Gripping his arm gently, I leaned closer as I whispered more urgently.  “What was it?  Was it a monster?”

 

He turned and looked at me then, and his eyes…his eyes scared me more than anything I’d ever seen.  He looked so scared, so lost, so desperate.  He mouthed “Yes” to me, and then seeming to not be satisfied, he leaned in and whispered.

 

“We have to keep doing it.  We can’t let it in.”

 

Lips quivering and eyes shining with unshed tears, he gave me a final look and then turned back to pretending to watch television.  We didn’t talk about it again until the next Halloween.

 

That’s when they started taking his fingers.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

As you know, your grandfather was a doctor, and both him and our mother were very clever and practical.  They had set up our lives where we were isolated but respectable, where no one would question if they went long periods of time without seeing us or our parents, as your grandfather had long-established himself as someone who took long sabbaticals and consulting trips to other states and countries, even if much of that time he was hidden away with us at home.  This established pattern of randomness made it much easier to fly under the radar and avoid any scrutiny, as if anyone would question the rich doctor with the sterling reputation who chose to home school his children in this ever-darkening world.

 

Still, their practicality wasn’t all about hiding what was going on from the world.  It was also about trying to find the best way to do it.  Your father’s toes, for instance.  They only took one at a time, as that was all that was needed each Halloween, and they left the big toes on both feet, as that’s what’s most needed for walking and balance.  It wasn’t until that ninth year that they ran out of toes and moved on to fingers.

 

The next few years…they were the hardest, I think.  As we got older, I grew increasingly angry and upset by what was happening, but talking to my parents about it changed nothing.  They would entertain brief, polite conversations about it, but it always came back to the same thing.

 

That it must be done, as the alternative was so much worse.

 

Talking to Bryan, I got pretty much the same response.  He grew more depressed and withdrawn with each year as bits of him were cut away, but when I tried to convince him we should run away or call the cops, he’d always get very angry and serious.  He’d tell me that I didn’t understand, and that he hoped I never would, but that we had no other choice.  That as bad as it was, this was the best way of keeping the four of us safe.

 

Something in the way he said it, the clear, pure fear I saw in his face, kept me from rebelling.  I didn’t know that my parents would lie to me, but I knew Bryan wouldn’t, and he wasn’t afraid of our parents—he was afraid of what came to collect every year.  He told me once that no matter how bad things seemed, that none of it really mattered.  All that mattered was keeping that thing away from us.

 

And so the years crawled by.  When I was fourteen and your father was fifteen, he was down to three fingers on his right hand.  I’d stopped complaining and questioning by then.  It wasn’t that I didn’t believe them—I can’t say what I thought was true at the time, but I’d come to accept that what I thought didn’t matter.  I was living in a world where sacrifices had to be made. 

 

So they would be.

 

The next Halloween, I drugged all three of them the night before.  Bryan I tied to his bed, but our parents I rolled onto blankets and drug down into the basement where I chained them.  I’d spent the last few weeks reading up on amputation and how to keep the patient alive, so I knew how to do the tourniquet before I cut our mother’s thumb off.

 

They screamed all afternoon, both during and after.  Commanding me to stop, begging me to stop.  Telling me that I didn’t understand.  That it wouldn’t work.  My father even offered his own finger instead of hers.  But no.  He needed his hands to work in case something went wrong, and the last few years, it had been her hands that were usually doing the cutting on your father.  So I gagged them and went on with what needed to be done.

 

I carved a fresh jack o’lantern in the kitchen by myself, tears streaming down my face.  I had the television turned up as loud as it would go, but I could still hear Bryan yelling from his bedroom and our parents from beneath.  It didn’t matter.  It would all be over in a few hours, at least for the year.

 

I put the candle and thumb into the pumpkin and set it on the porch before lighting it.  It was just before sunset now, and the growing shadows seemed darker than usual as I hastily positioned it on the front edge of the porch and then ran back inside, locking the door behind me.

 

I tried to keep myself busy, but I kept glancing out on the porch every few minutes.  Other than Bryan’s room, the next best spot was actually the letter slot on the front door, so I made countless nervous circuits through the house, always stopping to lift the little door over the mail slot and peer out at the porch beyond.  As always, there were a few lit decorations out there beyond the jack o’lantern, so I could see it perched on the edge of the porch even without it’s glowing face turned toward me, but time after time there was no sign of movement or change.  My stomach started cramping with worry as the night grew late, and by eleven, I went to Bryan’s room and let him out.  He was terrified and angry at first, but once I explained the situation to him, that it was already done and that our parents were relatively well down below, a weight seemed to come off of him.  He hugged me and started crying, thanking me over and over.  I started crying too, and for a few minutes we just stood there in the dark holding each other.

 

That’s when something started banging on the front door.

 

Panicked, Bryan ran back into his room and over to the window.  His already pale face drained of the last color as he turned to look at me.

 

“It’s trying to get in.”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

Instinct should have told us to run or hide, but all the years of belief and routine drove us instead to the front door as we frantically talked to each other about what was wrong.

 

“It…It’s never done this before.  What did you give it?”

 

“It was her thumb!  Mom’s thumb!  I thought it would work.  Your left one did.”

 

He frowned.  “I don’t know.  Maybe it will only take me now.”  We had reached the front door now, and I gave a startled yelp as the door creaked with another, louder bang. 

 

“No!  You’re not losing any more.”

 

Your father was opening his mouth to protest, but it was already too late.  I was in motion, the plan already formed before we’d made it to the door.  Plopping down in front of the mail slot, I stuck my left pinky in my mouth, careful to set my teeth at the gap between the bones.  I had to get it right the first time—before the door buckled, before I knew how much it hurt.  I pulled my right foot up and braced it against my forearm, sucking in a breath through my nose.  Then I bit and pulled and pushed and twisted all at once.

 

My finger ripped free in a stream of blood, hitting the back of my throat.  I had a moment of panic that I might swallow it reflexively before I gagged and spit it all out on to the floor.  The pain was terrible, but my fear was worse—fear that if I didn’t do this right, Bryan would hurt himself more.  So I ignored his screams and picked up the pinky from the foyer rug and shoved it through the mailslot.

 

It was snatched from me halfway through, and then there was a long movement of considering silence.  I wanted to get away from the mail slot, but I didn’t quite dare.  I had to be sure it had worked.

 

That was when I saw it, staring back in at me.

 

I felt my bladder go a little, but I didn’t care.  All I cared about was that it take what it was given and go.  Leave us all alone for another year.

 

And for a wonder, it did.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

The next few days were bad.  I got a bad infection in my hand, but between Bryan and my father’s guidance, I was better by the end of the week.  My mother got sick too, but at first it hadn’t seemed as serious.  Then on the fifth day, we went down to give our parents breakfast and our father told us she was dead.  He said it may have been infection or stress, or it may have just been a side effect of giving her flesh when it wasn’t acceptable.  He had been crying for several hours, and his voice was hard and coarse.

 

“That’s what I was trying to tell you.  To take from me.  It has to come from our bloodline.  Children are best, but more from adults can work.  But only if they are of our blood.  It’s always been that way since it started.”

 

We both wanted to ask why he hadn’t sacrificed himself instead of his son then, but we didn’t bother at the time.  I had seen it now, and I understood it had to be done.  If it wasn’t going to be me or Bryan, then it had to be our father.  That simple arithmetic was really all that mattered, and we knew it.  So we buried our mother in the woods behind our house and set about the business of living with a prisoner in the basement.

 

To be fair, our father never gave us any trouble.  He understood what we were doing and why we were doing it, and if he hated us for it, he kept that to himself.  He gave us all his passwords and PINs so we could order food and medicine, told us who to contact to send emails saying he was going out of the country with his family for awhile, everything we needed to succeed.  When the next Halloween came, he directed us how to cut off his left hand and safely cauterize the wound.  The following year, we did his right foot.

 

It was after that Halloween, as he was fighting through his own infection, that I finally asked him why they’d done it as they had.  Taken everything from Bryan instead of themselves or me.  He had been staring dazedly at the far wall, but now he focused on me, momentarily clear.

 

“We tried to isolate the harm.  Perhaps it was selfishness to not focus on myself for as long as I could, but what if we only had one child and it died?  Then I’d have used up time I could later gain with parts of myself instead of using it during it’s short life.  And if the child did live?  It would only have to bear it until eighteen if it had a child of its own.   It passes to the children when the oldest turns eighteen, you understand.  Don’t know why, but it does.”

 

I frowned at him then.  “So if Bryan or me hadn’t had a child by the time he turned eighteen, he’d have to cut parts off anyway?”

 

He nodded.  “Exactly.  And we could have shared the burden—me, him and you.  But that wasn’t optimal—inflicting such a burden on three people instead of one wasn’t fair or smart, it was just dressing up illogical emotion and calling it equity.  I…we wanted you to have a good life…for you both to have a good life.  So we tried to make your life the best it could be while protecting you from all of this.  Ideally you…you wouldn’t have to ever know the worst of it.”

 

Our father’s eyes were filling with tears now.  “But you do, don’t you?”

 

My own vision grew watery as I put my hand on his arm and nodded.  “Yes.  I’ve seen it.”

 

He squeezed his eyes tight, wet trails streaming down his cheeks.  “Then you understand.”

 

“Yes.  I do.”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

The next day he was dead.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

Wiping at my eyes, I smiled at Janet.  She was crying a little too—she usually did at this part, such a sweet, tender-hearted girl.  “We were really scared and sad for awhile, but a few weeks later, Bryan met your mother.  She was so pretty and sweet and smart, just like you.”

 

Janet giggled a little, but her face fell a little as she anticipated the next part.

 

“And then she had you, just three days before Halloween, which made us all so happy.  And…well, she passed away during that, but we got to keep the best part of her, didn’t we?”

 

She beamed and nodded, pointing to her shoes.  “Tell me about the toes!”

 

Bryan laughed a little.  “You’re so gross.”

 

Janet frowned at him.  “They’re my toes, and I want to hear about them!”

 

Chuckling, I waved my hand at them.  “Okay, okay.  So we’d already decided that we were going to take your little toes as soon as you were born.  That way you wouldn’t hurt as much or worry like your father had to.  You’d learn to walk with your big toes like a velociraptor, right?”

 

She did a loud dinosaur growl.  “Right!”

 

I grinned.  “Very scary.”

 

“We kept them in the freezer and used them year after year.  We were worried the second year that it might not work, an old, thawed out toe, but it went just fine.  And that’s how you’ve kept us all safe and happy for the last eight years.”  I started clapping and Bryan and Janet clapped along with me, laughing.  “Now that’s the story.  How about some candy?”

 

Janet nodded and stood up carefully, grabbing her bucket and taking Bryan’s hand as we walked out into the neighborhood.  The sounds of laughter echoed down the street as a group of pirates and ghosts ran from house to house.  I looked over at Bryan, and followed his gaze down to the concerned expression on Janet’s face.

 

I gave her hand a light squeeze.  “What’s wrong, honey?”

 

She looked up at me, her voice low.  Unlike our own parents, we’d always been honest with Janet once she was old enough to understand, and even at eight she knew how to be discreet.  “I just worry.  About my fingers.”

 

Bryan stopped and crouched down in front of her, sitting down her bucket and taking her small hands in his own.  “Sweetie, you know you don’t have to worry about that.”  He gently kissed the palm of both her hands.  “Nobody is taking anything else from you.”

 

She nodded uncertainly.  “I know, but…”

 

I put my free hand on her head, stroking her hair.  “No buts.  You’ve done your part.”  When she looked up at me, I gave her a grin and patted my bulging belly.
