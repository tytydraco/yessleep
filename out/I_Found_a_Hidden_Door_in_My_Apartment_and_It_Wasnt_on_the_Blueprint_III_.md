I'm shaking. I don’t want to be here. I have to move. I  have to get out of here. My last post can be found [[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/kPtmerxeFv)].

I’m posting this a couple days behind, so my apologies if things feel a little off-timeline. If I go silent for a while, please let Evelyn or my mom know what’s happening. Or contact the police. I’m from [redacted], and I run [redacted] Truck and Trailer Repair. My name is Jeremiah (redacted) but I go by Jay. 

Mom, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for everything, and I hope you can forgive me for whatever happens next. I never meant for any of this to get so out of hand.  I’m checking into a Motel. 

If anyone’s reading this and I don’t make another post soon, just know—something’s not right here, and I don’t think I have much time left. I have to go back  I know it…

Yesterday, I woke up on the cold tile floor of my kitchen, empty beer cans and bottles scattered like remnants of a failed attempt to forget. My throat was numb, but the first thing I noticed wasn't the usual staleness of spilled beer. It was the smell. It clawed at my senses—rancid, foul, like something had been left to rot in the walls for weeks. This wasn’t just the remnants of a bender. It was something else, something worse. The kind of smell that gets under your skin and stays there.

I sat up, rubbing my face, trying to shake off the disorientation, but it clung to me like the stench. The air felt thick, heavy with the odor that wasn’t there the night before. It made me gag as I tried to piece together the events of the last few hours. I remember Evelyn leaving, slamming the door and that damn box she forgot again. Then...nothing. Just a blur of alcohol, maybe a couple of half-hearted attempts at forgetting how screwed up things had gotten.

But the smell— that smell—was new. The pounding in my head was relentless, but it wasn’t just from the hangover. There was something else. Something more pressing, gnawing at the back of my mind. And that uneasy feeling I’d been trying to drown out for days—it was louder now, sharper, like the house itself was trying to tell me something.

I glanced around, half-expecting to find some explanation for the stench—maybe something in the trash, maybe something I’d forgotten. But the kitchen was as clean as it ever got. The smell wasn’t coming from here. It was coming from...elsewhere. From deeper in the building. Maybe from the store. And it hit me again—the door. The one with the chain and lock. 

I was strung about as high as piano wire when my eyes started to focus, still half in a daze from the night before. My head was pounding, and my mouth felt like I had chewed on sandpaper. As I blinked, something immediately felt off. The kitchen cabinet door was wide open, just hanging there, and the door—the one I was damn sure I’d closed and locked—was cracked open, chain still holding it shut. 

I stared at it for a moment, trying to process what I was seeing through the fog in my brain.

At first, I chalked it up to the draft again. Maybe the wind had pushed it open , slipped through some gap and just nudged it enough to mess with me. 

Nope…

Something about the way that door was sitting, slightly ajar but the chain still holding it closed didn’t add up to me. 

But again like a fool I brushed it off. 

I knew what I was gonna do as soon as my mind came to. No hesitation, just that early-morning clarity that comes when you’ve been thinking too much about something. I dragged myself up, barely feeling the soreness in my limbs, and threw on whatever was closest. And old Jacket, my Carolinas, and dad’s old Meritor hat. 

I hopped into my old truck—a rusty, temperamental thing that rattles and sputters like it's barely hanging on— and handles like a boat— and headed towards the shop. 

It was still dark out, the kind of early morning where the sky’s more navy than black, and everything feels cold and quiet.  Blue Dark.  Hunting weather. 

Just me and the sound of the engine humming through the silence. I went through my usual morning putter, like muscle memory at this point—nothing but the occasional bump in the road and the early sunrise creeping over the horizon to break the stillness. And of course Todd the homeless guy they made a Facebook page for but still leave out in the cold. Weird town. 

I stopped like I always do, at the shop across from where all my family’s buried. Everyone I know just calls it the graveyard. It’s a CitGo so it’s close enough to one. Just part of my routine as sacred as the sun coming up. There’s two C’s and an S I run on in the morning: Coffee, Cigarettes, and a Slim Jim. Been that way since I was about twelve. Yes, cigarettes included. 

I grabbed my usual from the gas station—coffee strong enough to strip paint, a pack of Marlboro Reds, and that Slim Jim that’s probably been on the rack longer than it should be, but hell, who cares? The damn things are like cockroaches they’d survive a nuclear holocaust. 

I drove to the shop and unlocked everything, the old familiar creak of the door greeting me. Daddy’s name flickered on the LED sign outside, a kind of silent signature he left behind in the world. He passed away about a year ago, and when he did, I was the only one of his kids who he knew would keep the place running. Out of all of us, I was the one who really paid attention, the one who showed up, the one he could put his faith in. The one who found him on the floor with the torch still on staring blankly into nothing. The one to carry on his name. 

I think he always knew it, too. Whenever he’d demonstrate something with a truck or give us a lesson, or make us hold the flashlight and ask for a 10mm socket only to smack us on the head for bringing him a drill, his gaze would often settle on me, as if he were passing down not just skills but a piece of himself.

I needed him now more than I ever have. I could almost hear his voice in my head, telling me to quit pussyfooting around and focus on the job and worry about work. Then later he’d probably come over, take a look at the door himself. Or maybe he’d track down Shane and give him an ass whooping. 

Then again, there was the third option—one that I hoped he wouldn’t have to say. But I know he would. 

He’d tell me to pack up, move out immediately, and come back home. But I couldn’t do that. I have to be by myself. That’s just how it is. He knew that. 

Hell Evelyn does too. 

I only had about four orders come in: a few PTO shafts needing built and some bad bushings and a Torque Rod that needed pressing even though the guy left them outside for the elements (DUMBASS). It was nothing I couldn’t handle in a couple of hours, so I had time. 

Plus, Esteban was already in the parking lot when  I got there, so I told him I was just picking up a grinder and heading home. I asked him to call me if he needed anything—like a job quote or any other urgent matter. Wednesday was usually a busier day, so I wasn’t too concerned about leaving the shop.

It’s been just me and Esteban since Dad passed so I figure he can handle it. We’re a small shop and the business is slow but steady. I’m only a town over anyway. 

I loaded up the air compressor and grinder, then headed back home. The door was calling to me louder than any shop task ever could. I was itching to find out what was behind it, more than I cared about the daily grind of running the shop.

I entered the stairway to my apartment from the street and was immediately hit by the overwhelming stench. The smell was so intense it practically seeped out from the hallway and into the street. It was a nauseating mixture of rot and decay that made me want to turn around, to flee back to the safety of the street, to ignore the gnawing dread that was clawing at my insides. The street seemed to whisper, urging me to go back, to find solace in the shop, or even to spend the night on the sofa in dad’s old office. Anything but venture further into this abyss. 

As I slowly climbed the stairs, each step felt like a mile, my stomach heaving as I fought the urge to gag. The smell grew stronger with every step, a vile presence that seemed to cling to the walls and choke the air. When I finally pushed open the door to my apartment, the scene that greeted me was one of chilling unease.

Shane was in my house. 


I took a deep breath and forced myself to walk further into the apartment. Shane, taking a knee in the corner of my living room, by the vent, was busy changing out air filters. The smell of decay mixed with the sterile scent of cleaning supplies.

Shane: Morning, Jay. Didn’t expect you back so soon.

He glanced up, his eyes cold and calculating. He had the screws from the vent in his hands. 

Me: Shane. What are you doing here? 

I clutched the compressor and grinder tightly in my hands 

Shane: Just taking care of some maintenance. Air filters can get pretty clogged up, especially in a place like this. What’s with the tools? 

He asked almost glaring blankly. 

Me: These? Oh. They broke I was gonna tinker with them a little today.

He continued working with a deliberate nonchalance, as if this were the most mundane task in the world.

Me: Ya know, you didn’t need to come all this way for that. I can handle it. It’s just air filters. 

Shane: Oh, trust me I know you can, Jay. I’m just making sure everything’s in order. How’s work at the shop? Busy? 

Me: It’s fine. We’re managing.

Shane: Good to hear. 

The silence between us rang out. It was like we both had something to say but didn’t want to. It was odd. 

Shane broke the silence looking downward then back up to me almost like he was figuring out how to be human. 

Shane: And Evelyn—how’s she? I know things were a bit rough before. 

His eye brows raised over his glasses and his forehead shifted upward moving his almost bare scalp back towards his crown. 

Me: Evelyn’s gone. She’s moved on. She’s been by collecting her things on and off. 

Shane’s eyes narrowed slightly, but he quickly masked it with a smile.

Shane: I see. Well, good luck with everything. Just a piece of advice before I go—

He straightened up, wiped his hands clean, and gave me a slow, almost predatory smile as he stood. Towering over me. 

Shane: You really shouldn’t have  messed with that door, Jay. Some things are better left alone. 

With that, he turned and walked out, leaving me standing there, grinder and air compressor in hand, feeling more unsettled than ever. The door—my thoughts immediately went back to it, now feeling more ominous than ever.


What the actual fuck.

I dropped my tools, the clang of metal on tile barely registering over the pounding in my ears. He knew. Jesus Christ, he knew. But how? I didn’t tell him. I hadn’t told anyone. The only people who knew were me and Evelyn, and she sure as hell hadn’t been talking to Shane. 

My mind raced, trying to piece together the implications of what he had said. That smile... the way he looked at me, like he already knew every move I’d made, every step I’d taken toward that damn door. 

I stepped toward the door and peered through the peephole. The fisheye view distorted everything, but I could still make out Shane’s hulking figure as he walked down the hallway. He didn’t rush. Didn’t hurry. Just casually made his way toward the building’s exit, like this was just another day for him. Like he hadn’t just completely upended my sense of safety in my own goddamn apartment.

As he stepped out onto the sidewalk, something hit me. When I pulled in, I didn’t see his van. I’d been so preoccupied with that smell, with the tools in my hands, that I hadn’t even noticed it was missing. 

Creepy bastard must’ve hidden the car somewhere I wouldn’t notice. He’d planned this out. He wanted me to know he could come and go as he pleased, whether I saw him or not.

I watched him until he disappeared around the corner, heading toward... somewhere. Probably the back alley or some side street, waiting for me to let my guard down. I held my breath for a few moments longer, making sure he was really gone.

Then I turned, locking the door behind me—not that it would do much good. He had a key. The realization hit me hard, settling in my chest like a weight. No lock, no deadbolt, no chain would stop him if he wanted to come back in. I was sitting in a cage, and he was the one holding the keys.

But I wasn’t going to just sit there and wait for him to make his next move.

Still, the fact that Shane had been in my apartment without me knowing... that he’d been up close, screwing with my air filters, walking around like he owned the place—that was too much. I glanced at the door again, the one that had been haunting me, the one he had warned me not to mess with. My skin crawled. He knew I’d opened it. He must’ve been watching. But how long had he been waiting to confront me? How long had he known that I was starting to poke around?

My heart pounded, and the air felt too thick to breathe. I waited a few minutes, listening to the silence settle around me before I plugged everything in—the air compressor whining to life, the grinder buzzing in my hand with a press of the handle. But before I got to work, I double-checked the door. Locked. Not that it would matter. Shane had a key. But I wanted something—anything—to slow him down. 

I glanced toward the kitchen, the smell of stale beer and rot still hanging thick in the air. My eyes drifted to the cabinet under the sink, the place I had been wanting to avoid but couldn’t. The hidden door.

As I opened the cabinet, a piece of paper fluttered out, and my heart nearly stopped. It wasn’t a note, though. It was a photograph, taped to the inside of the cabinet door. The picture was of Evelyn and me, walking down the street right out front of the apartment, our backs turned to the camera like someone had been watching us from a distance. 

But it wasn’t the photo that made me freeze.

Scrawled across it in thick, red sharpie were the words: DON’T

The message was clear, and my pulse raced as I stared at the door beneath the sink, knowing— really knowing—I was in over my head. But whatever was behind that door, it was calling to me. 

I closed my eyes. Bit the inside of my lip and from the black I heard the buzz of the grinder hitting steel. Then the sparks flew. 

I opened my eyes and focused on the link I started on. No safety glasses. Like a dumbass. My dad would be proud. He never wore them, and he never wore a welding helmet. He was a stare directly into the arc kinda guy. Never knew how he did that shit. 

I got through the first link. 

Then I felt something. 

Not physical. But of my own primal DNA. Something we all feel but can’t explain. The feeling of being watched by something that’s hunting you. I knew that feeling from hunting cougar with my dad. I was looking down and away from the door. The grinders blade was spitting metal shards back at me as I was cutting so I was adjusting the blade, and although I felt what I felt. I didn’t let it bother me. I pulled out my flashlight from my pocket. And shined it towards the grinder. When I did. I noticed the smell getting stronger. And a liquid oozing from the door. I traced the source. 

Back towards the door. 

Then I saw it. 

Through the crack. Right in front of my face. A human sized but deformed eye, jaundice in color and blue in the iris, with a pupil that narrowed from the light. 

It was connected to a mass of indiscernible pale flesh and it was staring at me from inside the door. 

It was a face. One that looked familiar but I couldn’t place it. 

My face went flush and my heart jumped from my chest as my hands trembled in fear. 

Me: JESUS WHO ARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU? 

I leapt back and fell from the cabinet. 

It turned back from the door. Then I heard it. 

The fucking scraping. The sound I’ve heard for two years. The sound I brushed off as wind. It has always been here with me. Just unknown. The liquid I believe was urine. It pissed on me. Or they pissed on me? I don’t know. I don’t want to know. 

It left me with one word. 

One deep almost gasping disembodied utterance of a word. 

“Mother”
