We wandered around the halls till we found our way out. A secret entry way to the elevator in case of emergency or for a quick-stop. The gate is closed shut, blocking our exit. I was going to scan the key, until I saw the scanner is far beyond repair. Just as I’m about to lose hope, Brock ripped the door open effortlessly, reminding me how much I forgot how strong he is.

I sighed in relief, and we strolled towards the elevator on the other side. I'll tell you; the room is refreshing. A room where there is no corpse, blood, monsters, or any sorts of nightmarish things. There’s nothing in this room but the scanner standing beside the elevator door, fresh and clean. I stepped to the scanner and swipe the key card through the slit of the machine. When the screen glowed an emerald light, the doors opened for us.

Brock is the first to walk in. When I took the card out, it sparked into flames. I dropped it due to the flaming heat burning against my skin. Baffling, once the card dropped to the floor, it melted into a small mountain of dust. Clueless as to what to think of it, I just stared at the pile, completely shocked of the unexpected. Nothing from the reports in the compendium said anything about it turning into ashes. Neither have I’ve ever heard that from anyone who had used it once in a while. Maybe it has something to do with the event we’re in. But moreover, we'll just take our leave.

I went inside the elevator and browsed the buttons labelled in numbers. Level 1 is displayed at the top amongst the other levels on the list. By pushing the button, the elevator ascended to our exit. Honestly, never have I've once used this elevator for anything. I thought we'd just teleport somewhere or something, part of the mystery of this place. But we ascended so fast that my legs are starting to tremble, which shock me to the core.

Just as I’m about to get squished to the floor, Brock wrapped his arm around me. My lungs begin to grow heavy, slowly sinking down to my belly.

Suddenly, the elevator halted immediately, sending me crashing my skull against the ceiling. For some reason life still clings to my soul! I wriggled over the floor in excruciating pain! It felt like my head is being slowly squeezed by two boulders! The only thing I can hear is the ringing in my head!

Mercifully, the ringing in my brain lessened, and the immense headache dissipated. I gasped, inhaling the air around me desperately. Black spots blur my vision, which adds disgust to my discomfort. "Phil! Are you alright!?" Brock picked me up, sounded anxious of my most horrible headaches I've ever have in my life. "Yeah… I'm good." I groaned. The black spots in my vision dissipates as I breath in the air around me.

Looking up at the screen on top of the door, it labelled Level 22 instead of level 1. "What the fuck?" I muttered.

"What is fuck?" Brock asked curiously. For some reason, the way he asked like a kid triggered parts of myself to slowly twist my head to stare at him. For a while, silence enveloped our senses until he spoke nervously. "What does it mean?"

I turned away, pinching the bridge of my nose with a sigh of exhaustion. I shake off Brock's question and focused on the screen. Why did we stop at level 22? Did it got stuck or did the power system fail to cooperate. SHIT! There’s still a small spike of pain in my brain!

"Did the elevator just got stuck?" I muttered at nothing. Then, the elevator opened, which answered unexpectedly to my concerns. My jaw dropped as I watch the doors spread apart to show the tunnels of hell. The darkness from deep within the tunnel of Dante’s inferno breeze against my skin. The dim torches on the walls reveal scribbled quotes marked on the floor in blood. *Purgatory*

My whole body trembled. I looked deeper into the darkness. I swear I caught sight of a pale creature smiling at me, fidgeting its slender fingers. I told myself that it’s all my imagination. But then I remember that this place holds monsters from many worlds. Imagining those creatures just builds up the fear inside my mind.

Shutting my eyes closed and breathing as if nothing has happened, I turn around, imagining myself in a summer vacation.

“We will conti- “Before Brock could ever finish his sentence, I twist around and start frantically pressing our exit button.

"NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO! THIS HAS TO BE A MISTAKE! THE ELEVATOR JUST GOT STUCK!! IT JUST GOT STUCK, THAT'S ALL!!" I kept frantically pressing again and again and again. The privilege key we had just found was burned away, which means we can't get out of here unless find another key. The thought of having to find one in this dungeon just makes me keep hoping the elevator could still work.

Suddenly, someone propped their hand on my shoulder. The cold and hard surface touch makes me jolt up in alert. I was about to scream before Brock shut my mouth with his palm. His hand smelled and tasted like pearl stone, and felt cold and smooth against my lips.

He shushed me and looked into the darkness. "We must be silent. Stay by my side, Phil." Easy for him to say. But at least I can count on him for safety. We’re going through this together anyway. But then, if he knew what we needed to escape, then why is he still walking by my side? I couldn’t really tell. Someday later, I think I may find a reason.

He drew his hand away and walked out of the elevator. I followed him, beginning our scavenge into the darkest depths of whatever horrors that await. Albeit, I’m scared. Because at any time an entity will pop out of nowhere and kill us without a trace. But with him around, I felt a bit safe.

Despite working here for 2 years, I've never visited anywhere else but the lobby, gym stations, and level 30. The reason was that I was prohibited from visiting other levels. That makes me wonder what other levels would look like, since this level had a different look to it than the level I was designated. And what will level 36 even look like. Hell? Tartarus? The centre core of the earth? And what if there was another level nobody mentions? The priest did say something of deepest depths of the prison.

Wandering through the maze of the tunnel, we found rows of empty rusted cells. We checked inside every cell we find to have discovered nothing but rotting mice, bandages, coffins, chains, and of course blood stains. One of the cells have a scent mixed with shit, rotting flesh and the worst junk being dumped in the world. You can already tell that I was going to vomit, but I didn’t, saving my coat with no stain. Except my own blood stain.

“Where’s the key?” I wondered.

“There should be a good pair of jeans I could wear.” I stopped walking to stare at him with absolute shock like I heard someone said the n-word. “Excuse me.” I said with my eyes squinted and eyebrows high. He turned around curiously. Silence have consumed the sounds of dripping sewer waters. “WHY JEANS!!?”

I can feel my eyes widen and brows furrowed deeply between the bridge of my nose. My hands are jittering as he looked down at his jeans. “They are stained of filthy smell. I don’t want to have a bad hygiene.” The tone in his voice made my tongue tie itself that I had to have the voice in my head say it for me. *Oh my god.*

I shut my eyes closed, relaxed my brows and took a deep breath before again feeling like my face is about to combust. “WE’RE IN HELL, BROCK!! There IS no jeans here! There IS no Pants here! And there sure ISN’T a single CLEAN JEANS in this Prison!!

He shrugged. He just shrugged his shoulders like it didn’t matter. “Maybe there is clean jeans. We have not yet explored everything.” I was about to choke him myself until I realized I’ve completely forgotten that he’s not human. This side of him is making me forget that he’s an alien, which really make me question about the universe.

Suddenly, an animalistic scream echoed from our direction. We snapped our eyes towards the source to find darkness. The torches didn’t really help lighten up the tunnel nor the mood. My shock melted down beneath my foot. My eyes widen as I stare at something running towards us. It looked pale. A bit wrong like watching a naked man running away from the devil. But as it got closer, my heart dropped to my stomach. 

It’s the Legend of the White Cannibal. The name sounds ridiculous but its features destroyed it. Its elongated lanky arms flail around wildly. Its 7 feet legs dashing within 15 steps per second. Now, the face can be easily described to be from whenever you close your eyes in the shower alone at night: Close your eyes and you’ll imagine a face with its jaw dropped to its collar bone and empty eyes wide enough to fit your cup in.

While being unable to move a muscle, Brock stepped forward to guard me from the White Cannibal. I don’t know if I’m imagining things but it’s running a lot slower than the compendium have stated. It can run for about 145 miles per hour. The compendium doesn’t lie, well sort of. Then why is it running at the speed of a car travelling 40 miles per hour.

It was almost 30 feet away before it vanished. Something crushed a hole in the wall at our right. The screaming disappeared. The sound of colliding rubble echoed from the hole. I looked at Brock with the same thought. What happened? We were going to investigate but a bulky humanoid stomped out of the hole before us. I thought it was just another random entity. But when I looked at him closer, 300 volts tazed my entire body. 

He holds his own basketball: the head of the White Cannibal. He threw it at the torch, scoring a one. This looked ridiculous but it didn’t help calm down the fear rooting through my muscles. He turned his head towards us. The torch next to him revealed his blank expression. Then his face turned into an unpredictable mood: Eyebrows raised, squinting eyes, joking grin.

“Caught a score.” Samson said.

I remain frozen. “What?” I heard Brock speak out confusingly. At least he’s got more balls than I do.

Samson chuckled, taking steps towards us. The daggering eyes of his violet coat monster glared into my soul, holding me still with its invisible hands. “You never heard of basketball? Come on. Everyone in the omniverse knows Basketball. Even my tribe knows it while surviving in the jungle.”

“Basketball? I may have heard that before.”

“Of course you have. You’ve lived for billions of years.” They remained silent for what felt like hours, until gratefully, Brock immediately jumps back to the subject.

“We don’t mean to harm you.” I wish it can be that easy. Just tell him we don’t want to fight and he’ll go away. But of course, direct orders from the priest himself. There’s no crawling out of this one.

“Tch. Do I look like I give a shit.” Samson said back calmly. Abruptly, a mixture of explosion and collapsing debris ring my ears. I immediately turned to find Brock disappeared, only to display Samson in a football tackle pose, smoke flickering out of the muscles of his arm. I turned again to find only darkness deep in the tunnel. Then, shooting out of the curtains, a bright flash smashed into Samson under a second, sending him soaring back. The bright flash was none other than Brock, fist raised. I couldn’t see a single bruise nor a sign of injury. He’s completely unfazed. I can see the trail of light, as if I’m watching an aurora within the darkness.

Before I could react, the hunter returned to give Brock a knuckle sandwich, catch him by the shoulder and launched him away into crashing multiple walls. It’s a lot worse than I’d ever thought. Watching Samson’s body fade into nothing, a frightening question burned into my mind: Could he be as fast as the priest?

At first, I thought Brock can handle just fine on his own. He could beat him, right? And I can go find the key. I turned around only to stop. Part of myself reminded me of the risks I’m taking. If I go alone, there’ll be entities that could be as powerful as Brock, Samson and the rest of his crew. I’m not strong enough to defend myself, with only the ability to… I don’t really know what I could do at all. And I need Brock’s wits in order to get through this mess.

I take deep breaths before running through the holes on the walls. I ran past 32 walls until I found Brock crashing to the ground, causing an earthquake. The room is some sort of dark hellish arena, enough to have thousands of audiences to join together and watch the opponents kill each other. The walls are pieced together with skulls that looked to be from 3600BCE.

I couldn’t process what was going on, because I’m watching lines of violet light darting all over the place! Then, the sound of crashed metal bashed my brain. I cupped my ears and watch an explosion of wind breaking down traces of light. At the centre of the arena, both of them wrestled against each other: Their hands closed together, pushing against each other.

“Holding back won’t do you any good!” Samson said as he knocks Brock’s gut with his knee. He then wrapped his hands around his neck and headbutted him in the face. Brock stumbled back by the strike. With no intention on wasting time, Samson cupped his hand on Brock’s face and crashed his head into the ground. Branches of cracks spread all around the arena. Clouds of dust exploded in every direction. As weird and non-logical as it sounds, the debris are floating in the air as if time have slowed down.

My heart sank. As the cloud dies out, Brock is being brutally beaten by Samson’s barrage of fists. For the first time, I witness Brock’s defeat. I can tell he was already getting tired from the fight. Standing here, I couldn’t help but feel a knife in my chest. I don’t stand a chance against him, nor could I help Brock fight this psychopath. I wanted to do something, anything to stop him from killing him.

I scavenged around to only find rubble. Rubble…

I picked one up and threw it at Samson’s head. He stopped. His blank face stared at me as he stands straight up. He raised his eyebrows, offended of my abruptness. “A piece of rubble. The priest expected more of you.” He started to walk towards me, leaving behind his completely injured foe.

When I take a step back, a loud roar echoed from the ceiling. He stopped in his track, chuckled beneath his breath in satisfaction. “Sounds like lunch break. I’ll leave this one to the two of you. Or just you.” And with that, he turned and strolled away, disappearing into the darkness.

Then, *something* landed down from the ceiling.
