Today, my peaceful life has been turned upside down and a part of me has died. The future is bleak, and all the fault lies with this bloody decision. I really don't agree with the judge's choice, and I'd like to say something about it.

To help you understand the situation I find myself in, we need to go back in time. Exactly four years ago.

I had just tragically lost my wife. I don't want to go into the details, her killer was put away for life, and I have to make sure I live as long as possible to go and spit on his grave.

Since I was living in an area deep in the French countryside, socializing with people was a rarity for me, and the fact that I lived completely alone, looking after the farm my father left me, didn't help matters. I more or less provided for myself, and had very little dependence on the outside world - it's not that I didn't like human contact, it's just that I preferred to stay in my own bubble.

As the days went by, this feeling of solitude only increased. Lack of noise is certainly one of the things I can't stand, and I'd reached a stage where a change was necessary, if only to keep my sanity.

I used to allow myself an occasional outing to a large park between the nearest town and my farm. The park is a long way from my home, but the drive does me a lot of good. Although I'd lost my wife, I didn't feel hatred or envy when I watched families having a good time at picnics. They were entitled to happiness, but I was entitled to mine too, the only one I'd ever had having been taken away in the most despicable and cruel way imaginable.

It was a Sunday. The sky was a hypnotic blue and the sun was shining brightly. As usual, I was reading a book on my favorite bench near the playground.

Several hours later, I was awakened from an unexpected nap on my favorite bench, book in hand and drool flowing. I sometimes fell asleep when the softness of the night invaded the park. It was a kind of rubbing on my leg.

And that's when I realized that my life was going to change overnight.

It looked sheepish, and just stood there looking at me as if it expected something from me.

I asked "Are you alone, good boy?". No answer. There was no indication of his name or address to be seen, and the only occupant of the parking lot was my old Peugeot 205.

What first crossed my mind was the sane and logical thought of calling the authorities, but it was the second thought that won the day. As I took my phone out of my pocket, the reflection of my face on the still unlit screen was an electroshock. Loneliness had been eating away at me, the dark circles under my eyes repulsive and the sadness of my own gaze almost nauseating.

Then I remembered Sebastian. Sebastian lived about ten kilometers from my farm and visited from time to time. He was much older than me and had explained to me that he'd managed to combat loneliness with a stray cat he'd adopted. He was never married, and when he realized, too late, that he never would be, that stray cat he found in the woods was, he said, his lifeline, right up until his death last year. I don't know what happened to the cat.

Then I realized I'd found my own lifeline.

I put my phone back in my pocket and stroked the head of my new companion, whom I decided to call SÃ©bastien. I told myself that giving this name had been done on a whim, but Sebastian was the most logical choice for me at the time.

Sebastian's sad eyes and lack of energy, who must have been abandoned by irresponsible people, didn't make me feel pity, but were rather a breath of hope. Hope for a companion to brighten up my morbidly boring days.

As soon as I brought Sebastian home, I started looking after it as best I could. I was very attentive at first, and made it feel at home on the farm.

At first, as it regularly tried to escape, I set up a kennel with a doghouse in the backyard, the kind of kennel that makes you think of Snoopy's one. The kennel was wire-meshed and I put a chain around its neck to prevent any "digging a hole and running away" situation. It could take shelter when it rained, and keep more or less warm when it was cold. In summer, I made sure it didn't run out of water.

However, the more the days went by, the more I tired of its company.

Sebastian spent a lot of time barking, and despite numerous canings, the situation didn't improve. To punish Sebastian for his bad behavior, I didn't put water in its bowl for several days in the summer. To make it understand that it had to behave, I took away its doghouse in winter and put it back once it had calmed down, or was too frozen and tired to continue growling as it so often did.

I used to smile with pleasure when I saw Sebastian looking for any kibble in his kennel. My annoyance was growing, and I found a certain pleasure in seeing him suffer.

I'd take Sebastian out to a forest not far from my house from time to time, and despite everything, it loved to play. It took a while, but after a few weeks, Sebastian'd manage to bring back the ball I threw, guided by the pleasure of receiving a piece of raw meat or a kibble as a reward.

What I didn't know was that in this same forest there was now a new trail, very suitable for quiet walks, appreciated by the few city dwellers who come to recharge their batteries in the countryside from time to time.

Walking on this trail was a fatal mistake.

Sebastian hadn't been used to seeing people for 4 years, since I picked it up in the park. I'd spent months trying to tame and educate it, but I hadn't really thought about how to handle it in public.

The only thing I knew was that a muzzle was essential. Sebastian often barked, which kept me awake at night, and liked to bite, which it had done on several occasions in the past. I still have a few scars. And I think I broke a few bones in return, kicking Sebastian in the ribs as a punishment.

So I'd got into the habit of putting its muzzle on during walks in the woods, and figured it wouldn't be a problem if we were to bump into someone.

As I explained to the judge, it's not my fault, nor Sebastian's, that the Parisian tourist died as a result of the injuries inflicted by Sebastian.

I told her not to remove Sebastian's muzzle, but she wouldn't listen.

She screamed so much at the sight of Sebastian, for some reason, that she wouldn't or couldn't hear anything.

If Sebastian tore half her throat out when she removed its muzzle, it was purely out of defense - it had a muzzle for a reason.

As I watched the Parisian tourist bleed to death in front of me on the trail, I was amazed at how the few teeth Sebastian had left were sharp enough to completely rip through skin, flesh and bone.

The yellowed, rotten teeth that remained had done a hell of a lot of damage.

But neither the police, the jury nor the judge would admit that Sebastian had only defended himself.

It seems that its parents, the irresponsible ones who had cowardly left *him* in the park 4 years ago, are going to take care of *him* now.

I've lost custody of my son, an 8-year-old boy whom I looked after as best I could for four years, and I don't agree with this decision at all.
