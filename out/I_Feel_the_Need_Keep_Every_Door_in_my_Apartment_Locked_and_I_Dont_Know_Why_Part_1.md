I’ve been through countless therapists, doctors and medication in my adult life but nothing seemed to work. I’ve always had this anxiety and ‘looking over my shoulder’ type behavior (as my therapists coined it) since I was a teenager. Most professionals I talked to tried to explore my past and get to the root of my problems through therapy; but there wasn't a root. One day I was ‘normal’ and then the next, I was like this. I didn't have issues making friends, fitting in or with any abuse growing up, my parents were far from perfect but they stayed together and made for a decent enough childhood.

Yet I was still a wreck. I couldn't hold down a job, I could barely get through my day without having a panic attack about strange sounds coming from my apartment. This anxiety could only be quelled with a unique ritual that I had to do or I’d lose my mind. Each and every door in my apartment was locked, inside and out. So to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night I’d get up and unlock the bedroom door, walk through, close behind me and lock again, walk down the hallway, unlock the bathroom door, open, walk through and then close and lock behind me. Each door in my apartment has a different key on my keyring that I carried around at all times.

I’d tried to work a normal office job but the constant nonchalant use of unlocked doors was just too much. The knocking on office doors, the slow creak as a door came to a close unassisted, it all drove me mad. In big public spaces I was okay, but as soon as the room didn't feel as populated and inside a non-locked room, I would FREAK out.

Thankfully I was able to have a programming job from the comfort of my own apartment. It paid like trash but I worked my own hours and could stay in the relative comfort of my own place. A Ring doorbell also came as a god-send, being the only reason I was even able to conceive of opening my front door to mail or visitors.

When talking to yet another new therapist, she mentioned a new type of therapy that’s gaining traction in the world of therapists and neuroscientists. She called it RMT (Recovered Memory Therapy) a specific type of treatment designed to uncover repressed memories and explore them in detail. 

Thankfully, a start up practicing this was in need of people to try it out and I assume my therapist mentioned how much of a wreck I was. If they could fix me, that would be big news and a big win for investors I imagine. So I took the free consultation, met at their dinky little office and made arrangements for the therapy. 

There was so much red tape, so many things to sign and many medical examinations to check I wasn't allergic to what they wanted to use on me. It took a while but eventually I was given a date for the session.

The big day finally came, I made sure to lock every door in my apartment, put on a nice shirt I felt presentable in and took the bus over to their office. I met with the therapist that would be guiding me through the therapy and she seemed nice, Dr Monday was her name. Her office was simple but decorated with multiple awards and doctorates. Dr Monday explained how the therapy works; it’s basically a guided meditation with a very particular cocktail of drugs going through me. She mentioned how I’d always be hooked up to the machine and at her command she could adjust the mix of drugs flowing into my veins. I guess this would scare a lot of people but I didn't care, I just wanted to be fixed. Even if I wasn't, this was all free so why not? 

I was allowed to wear my usual clothes instead of a hospital gown which was nice, I assumed it was just to make me more comfortable.

Dr Monday and I had a casual chat as we wandered from her office to the therapy room, my keys jangling at my side with each step but she knew the extent of my coping mechanisms and did not question the sounds.

We got to the therapy room and she let me in. It was basically what you’d expect; a small room with a low ceiling, no windows and a single door leading in. There was a chair and small desk where she would be operating from and on the other side of the room a giant bean bag chair with a medical machine next to it. You know the type, it’s got a vague round shape, surrounded in the white plastic shell to make it look clean and not intimidating despite sticking out like a sore thumb in any place that wasn’t a hospital.

As I entered, I heard the door close behind me, then a jingle of keys. I turned to see Dr Monday twisting a key in the door, then checking it was firmly locked with a pull of the handle. She looked at me with a polite smile and said “This would be more comfortable for you right? We make sure each therapy session is tailor-made for our clients” I felt like my heart could finally rest when I saw that door close and lock, a wash of calmness came over me so powerful it took me a moment to break out of it.

“Thanks, I really appreciate it Doc” I replied and with no hesitation I sat on the bean bag chair and allowed her to hook me up. There was only a small needle into my left arm, the needle itself taped down and a transparent plastic tube that led up and into the machine. It didn't hurt. I could barely even feel the metal sink directly into a vein on my forearm, technology sure had come a long way since I was last in a hospital.

I tried to relax, feeling my body sinking into the seat that moved around my body like it was trying to swallow my form. The room itself was silent, save for a gently ticking wall clock, the type of clock you’d see in offices and schools, only able to hear it in a perfectly silent room. The ticking came as a relief, each passing tick and tock meant I was just that much closer to being fixed.

Only then did I actually wonder what types of memories I'd repressed. Did something really happen when I was younger? Did someone I know die or did something bad happen to me? I really had no idea and had to go in with an open mind.

Dr Monday sat at her desk, notepad and computer terminal ready. She held up a small voice recorder, waving it slightly so I could see it.

“As explained before, this session is recorded so we can analyse further after the season itself. You’ll get a copy of the audio file and a transcript for your own keeping. Are you ready to start Mark?” she asked with her thumb over the start button and a raised brow.

I simply nodded “Yeah, I think so.. Just relax right?” I adjusted myself in the sinking seat and soon heard the click of the recorder. She set it down on the desk, pointed so it would pick up both of our voices with ease.

Dr Monday introduced the session

“This is Dr Monday conducting RMT session 13 with the client Mark Butler. It is currently February the 28’th at 10:34 AM and we are ready to start with phase one” She spoke almost directly to the voice recorder and clicked a button on her keyboard.

“You’ll feel some cold liquid in your arm now Mark, it might make you sleepy, lightheaded or sickly. It’s important you tell me exactly what you’re feeling so I can adjust it” her tone now was much more professional and stern. I guess some people didn't follow her orders.

I nodded again whilst I watched the colorless liquid slowly trail down the plastic towards my arm. I remember specifically thinking ‘Ahhh here comes salvation’. Whatever it was, it entered my bloodstream and a moment later I felt a rush of lightheadedness hit me. I fought with the weight of my own head to not let it drop, not sure if my neck felt weak or my head weighed a literal ton.

“How are you feeling Mark?” she asked whilst watching tentatively, her fingers at the ready on her computer.

I swallowed before replying, trying to be as accurate as possible. “Urgh, my head feels heavy but I feel light headed too. I..I guess I feel all tingly as well but not exactly bad”

“I understand, I’m adjusting now” Dr Monday replied, typing something on her computer, the screen facing away from me. Slowly, I felt the worse effects relax, my head still felt physically heavy and metaphorically light but a lot less severe. “That's better. Much better” I said with a chuckle. Dr Monday took some time to let me settle before she continued with the therapy.

“Okay Mark, I’m going to add the Y-17 compound and we can begin your guided meditation, please say anything that comes to mind, any thoughts, memories and even feelings” I nodded again in response.

She clicked her keyboard and a new liquid pushed down the tube, this one a very, very faint blue tone. I wasn't sure how I knew but it looked more syrupy than the last mixture. As I was watching the liquid enter my system, the lights slowly dimmed to a level you’d see in a club, not straining my eyes at all.

Then, the real effects started. I was hit by a high I’d never felt before. In my life I’d done a myriad of drugs, trying to calm my mind or just to distract myself from my anxiety but this, this was different. It felt like my entire body was sunk into a warm bubble bath. I tingled all over, I felt every nerve in my body, feeling the part of your body that your mind usually forgets about day to day. I could feel my keys pressing into my upper thigh, my elbows, behind my ears and in between my toes all with the feeling of the rest of my body.

“Holy Fuck” I let out, my mind didnt care I was being recorded, the rush was too good to hold back. My body relaxed even more somehow and I shakily took off my glasses, setting them on the floor next to me. Dr Monday snickered typing on her keyboard, each keypress sounding unique, as if I could hear what specific key she was pressing. “Yeah, that’s the usual reaction, feeling good? Nice and relaxed?” I nodded for the last time. I lay my head back and closed my eyes, I felt like the only thing I could do with this new feeling. “Righty, down to business” I heard from her, hearing the gentle flicking of paper with what I assumed was the script they used to prompt memories.

Writing this post, I wasn't sure how to continue. I have the transcript and the audio file of the therapy but it’s all too muddled as Dr Monday had to get me back on track many times. Of course I found hidden memories of when I was a teenager, horrible memories I wished I’d forgotten, locked away and thrown the key into a volcano or something.

I will write about these memories as they occurred to me. Many of them are fact checked by my own recording but I think it’s easier to tell you all what was going through my mind instead of just what happened and what I said.

I wish I’d never had that session.

With the unknown drugs going through my mind and Dr Monday expertly guiding the mediation, I was steered towards a certain period in my life, that being my teenage years. We kept narrowing down the years, months and eventually to the days where my memory was blocked.

Dr Monday felt something was missing from what I’d told her about my memories around that time and she said “Think of a friend during this time, someone you were close to, someone who you could be yourself with” and with that I had my first revelation; Ryan.

Most of it came back to me in an instant, it still impresses me how fast memories can be recollected, years of experience falling into place. I'd always described my teen years as lonely yet I got up to plenty of things, only when I remembered Ryan, I realised I was never alone.

Back in the day, I was growing up in a pretty rural part of the country, fields, farms, abandoned malls and the like were the only entertainment. Ryan was my best friend, heck he was more like a brother to me.

Our parents were close since our dad’s worked at the same company and he only lived around the corner. Each family would take turns looking after us for the afternoon so the other couple could go out for date nights and the like. But as Ryan and I grew to teenagers, we were left to our own devices in that rural town.

We got up to all sorts of mischief; Exploring abandoned places, pranking farmers, moving road signs, whatever we could to prevent boredom. We weren't exactly trouble makers but we always toed the line between funny and actually causing harm, sure we got a smack on the wrist now and then but what rural living kid didn't?

Ryan and I fed off of each other, one would think of something to do and the other would expand and modify until the perfect evening plan was set.

A memory of a night came back when we snuck into school in the middle of the night and swapped all the teacher’s notes to different classrooms. They’d come in the next morning to find their desks organised but with another teacher’s stuff on and their papers, notes and desk trinkets were across the school on another teacher’s desk. It wasn't much but it was entertaining to watch the next day, probably the only day we arrived at school that early.

Dr Monday, I think, could feel herself getting closer and closer to the source. She made me recall more fond memories with Ryan, more mischief and teenage antics. She then asked “What happened to Ryan? Where is he now?” I couldn't answer. I didn't know.

One day he was there and the next he wasn't. Still my mind was repressing something deep, something terrible. She helped narrow down the days as I recalled each day like I had an eidetic memory (when you can recall everything perfectly like your whole life was recorded in your mind) I remembered what I ate, what I said, what everything looked like down to the smallest details that I could physically see.

She kept my focus on Ryan as I told of more days and months until a memory came to me, seemingly locked away behind more memory doors. “One day we… visited this Hotel” I mumbled, still trying to search my memories for more details.

“Hotel? What hotel? Where was this hotel? How did you find it?” Dr Monday said, bombarding me with questions, all designed to help more memories float to the surface.

“I don't know the name but I remember reading about it online, some old forum Ryan showed me” I mumbled to Dr Monday as my mind recollected all the details as if I was reliving them in a collage of thoughts.

It was a special week that week; summer and all four parents were away on vacation leaving Ryan and I plenty of time to get into trouble. The moment our parents all left, Ryan and I started with our plan making but nothing concrete came about it. We ended up watching StarWars Episode 1, drinking soda and snacking on anything that would rot our teeth. Ryan slept over at mine, all I could think about that night was what to do. It had to be big, new and more than we’d gotten up to before.

When I woke up, I saw the bedroom door was open and a light was coming from my dad’s office. Ryan wasn't in his sleeping bag next to my bed. I left the comfort of my bed and wandered to the office only to find Ryan reading some forum post. His nose was practically pressing to the screen, I watched his eyes dart left to right, down a line and repeat as he read.

“Ryan? What the fuck are you doin’?” I asked, rubbing the sleep from the corner of my eyes. He slowly looked up at me, eyes red from a mostly sleepless night.

“This is it dude! This is what we’re gonna do! Read it, cmon” He stood and ushered me into my father’s leather desk chair, pushing me to the desk. He reached over and scrolled to the top of the post, eagerly pointing.

“Alright! I’ll read it! Jesus dude…” Was all I could reply with as I leant closer to read the post.

Whilst in the therapy, I recalled the post almost word for word, I couldn't find the post again, even on the way back machine. Parts are missing as I remembered pictures and even a video proving this poser correct. Below is the post I read in its entirety.

How to Travel the world for free

I’ve found a way to teleport, yes teleport to any building around the planet. You can save money on travel and flights with this trick I found. I first came across this phenomena at an abandoned house. I like to explore places like these just to see what people left behind, you never know when you’d be able to make a quick buck either.

There was this one house, far outside of town and in a whole rundown area, I was checking each house on the street and this one seemed as normal as any of the others. Most notably, the front door was half open and when inside, there were no other doors in the property. Not that there were no standard doorways but it seemed the house used to have doors and they were all removed. I didn't think this was strange until I went up the splintered wood stairs and saw the only door inside the house. It looked newer than the rest of the house, a clean wooden door with a perfectly flush surface to the floor and frame as if it was air tight. On the front of the door was a symbol, it didn't look like any symbol I'd seen before but looked like an Asian character made of multiple smaller parts all combined to give meaning. When I got closer I could see the symbol was smeared on, some type of ashes.

I didn't think anything of it until I placed my hand on the handle and pushed the door open. Immediately I was met with a putrid yellow light. Shielding my eyes, I looked through the gap in my fingers to see a hotel hallway. A hallway like any other. I stepped in, completely in a trance as I looked left and right. No windows, just disgusting yellow wallpaper and doors every 10 feet or so. On the left, there was a t-section 20 doors down. On the right, a left turn about 5 doors down. On every wall were doors, all with their own symbols straight on the front, each symbol unique yet identical upon a single glance all made of a type of ash. Every single door was different but mundane. It looked as if this were a shop for doors. Most were wooden but some were plastic or metal. All of them with handles, some with designs, some blank and flat.

Yes, I had discovered an alternate dimension, the hotel stretched far wider than the house itself would hold. Curiosity got the better of me and I wandered in, making a mental note of the surface and symbol on ‘my’ door before I started to wander the halls. I took a left and wandered towards the t-section, noticing the unworn carpet, bright yellow lights and distinct lack of common building safety requirements. There were no fire exit signs or fire extinguishers on the walls, no marks in the carpet, no splotches on the walls, no plug sockets in the walls. Yet the entire space was spotless. I reached the t-section and looked left and right, seeing an almost endless corridor expanding for as far as I could see. The corridors just kept going, getting smaller and smaller in my vision until it all blurred together. That's when I noticed there wasn't a single sound. No AC blasting, no footsteps from the floor above, nothing. The silence was unsettling even compared to the silence of an abandoned building.

I kept wandering, making notes of each turn I took but eventually I grew bored seeing the same hallways over and over and over. Nothing stood out as different, no hallway looked like it could have an exit and nowhere seemed to lead to stairs or an elevator. With no other option as I didn't want to leave this place empty handed, I turned to the closest door and pulled it open. What I saw shocked me. It wasn't another ethereal place or some strange new hallway but an office. A normal looking office was now in front of me, the lights off and the sky outside the windows was dark with lights illuminating from the street below. Immediately, I was overcome with a sense of comfort as this place looked lived in, desks had pens and paper across, monitors were all at different heights to suit whoever was stationed there. Overcome with the familiar feeling of being ‘home’ I stepped into the office and let the door come to a close behind me. The moment I did, the lights came on and an alarm started to blare. I turned and yanked open the door I'd just come through only to find it led to a bathroom. I thought this wouldn't be happening, trying the door again and again but it just led to a bathroom like any normal door. With the ear-splitting alarm going, I tried a few other doors but they all led to meeting rooms, bathrooms and storage rooms. I ran to the door that connected the office to its hallway and gave it a sharp pull. Nothing. I was stuck in this office, a sitting duck for the authorities to arrest me for trespassing.

To cut a long story short, I was in China, yes China. The building security came and detained me. We struggled to communicate but one spoke decent enough English that I could somewhat explain my situation. I guess they thought I was on drugs or homeless or something because they let me go. Without a penny in my pocket or a working phone, I ended up actually being homeless in China. I scrounged for food and tried to look for any foreigners but I was in a more industrial part of the country where only truckers and metal workers visited. My only option was to recreate the door I found in the abandoned house to get back to the United states.

Through testing I found the formula to create a door to the hotel. First find a well maintained door and frame, it needs to be as flush as possible and have some kind of handle. Being flush is important. Next is the symbol. Through my testing I tried all sorts of ashes but none worked until I tried cremated human remains, it has to be human or the door won't work. The symbol itself needs to be drawn on using some bonding agent, saliva works fine. Finally for the pattern of the symbol pretend as if you are writing an abstract asian character, add curls and dots and straight pieces. The ones that worked for me usually had a sense of purpose behind them, like I was actually writing some symbol that had a meaning. Then, viola! You have a working door to the hotel. Try every door, most are locked it turns out but they lead all over the world. The best way I’ve found to find a door back to your home country is to hold your phone through from the side of the hotel and see if it connects to your mobile provider. That or some type of GPS works just as well.

Now if you decide to replicate my findings, follow these two rules to an absolute. Firstly, do NOT and I repeat do NOT stay in the hotel if you hear noises, get out as soon as possible, no matter where you end up. Secondly, stay away from the elevators. They’re rare but you can find them, just stay away and don’t wait for one to arrive and especially do not get onto the elevator as you’ll lose the floor you were just on.

\~

When I’d finished, I sat back in silence. “This can’t be real dude. This CANNOT be real” I scoffed, doubting what I’d just read despite seeing the video and pictures attached with the post.

“Don’t hurt to try eh Mark?” He laughed behind me, his hands were gripping the back of the office chair with an enthusiasm I’d never seen in him.

“We’ve even got your Gran’s ashes downstairs we could use. You know, for the door!” I couldn't help but laugh, most people wouldn’t want to smear their grandparent’s ashes all over a door as per instructed by an internet post but my gran (dad’s side) was a bitch so I didn’t mind using her ashes for this.

“Fine! I guess we’ve go no other plans to do so fuck it” I agreed with Ryan, much to his delight. He was busy jumping about the office as my hand reached for the mouse. I clicked on the poster’s profile only to be met with a \[this profile has been deleted\] message. When I tried to go back to the post, I couldn't find it. We tried everything we knew how but in the older days of the internet people (especially some countryside teenage boys) didn’t know how to find lost media.

We both agreed to go with the plan, to find this hotel, explore and maybe even spend a couple days in another country, one with sun and hot chicks hopefully.

We started our preparation. Ryan packed bags with spare clothes, phone chargers, money, stuff we could sell in case we ended up in the middle of nowhere. We even packed swimming trunks, sun screen and flip flops, ready for a good part of a week away. Ryan and I didn’t leave anything to chance, we stuffed in maps, a basic translation book for the most common world languages my mom owned and food, plenty of food and drinks.

We split both bags evenly so in case we were separated, each had enough to survive and get home safely. Finally we poured a second bunch of ashes into freezer bags for each backpack, hopefully we could use it to get back home like the original poster did.

All was set. Bags were packed, we even prepared gloves and hiking boots for the worst of the worst. We attached a sleeping bag to the side of our bags and made the final preparations; the door.

Ryan took a power nap into the early hours of the morning but when he woke, he took one heavy swig of an energy drink and was raring to go. I couldn’t help but feel the same energy back then, the excitement, the rush of adventure. Of course, we both had the thought in our minds that this wouldn’t even work but it was better than watching TV all day and night.

With our bags packed and caffeine running through our systems, we next started on the door ritual. My bedroom door was perfect, put in a couple years ago, perfectly flush to a flat wooden floor. When it was closed, not a photon of light seeped through the edges.

Jittering with a new level of excitement in my life, I remember licking my thumb and dunking it into the urn, attaching plenty of my gran’s deeply charred remains to the end of my thumb. I walked up to the door with Ryan avidly watching from the bed.

Just as the post explained, I took my thumb and started to draw, thinking about the hotel, the pictures of it, how the poster described it. My arm felt as if it moved on its own back then. Looking back I guess it was a similar phenomena to when artists say their hand moved on its own for a painting.

Straight lines, curves, circles, loops, the symbol had it all. When I was done, I stepped back and waited. Ryan waited too. I’m not sure what exactly we waited for back then but I suppose my teenage mind was waiting for some video game effect to show that the door was now connected to the hotel.

“Looks good to me. Lemme try it!” Ryan snapped up to his feet, stepped over the bags and pressed down on the door handle.

He gave it a push forward with his shoulder and the moment he did, we could both see that egg-yellow light streaming into my bedroom. Our eyes went wide with amazement. ‘It worked, it really fucking worked’ I remember thinking as I shakily set the urn down and stood next to Ryan.

He and I looked about the hotel corridor in amazement, careful not to step through, just peering in. It was as if my very room was a hotel room, seamlessly opening into the corridor without issue, like it had always been that way. I recalled us staying that way for a while, staring into the hotel, peeking out like we’d just had a prank knock and were looking for the perpetrator.

“I’ll hold it, gimme my bag” Ryan mumbled, moving his back to the door so he could hold it open.

“Yeah, we’re actually doing this huh?” I replied with a snort and a chuckle. I fetched both bags, handing Ryan his before I took the step into the hotel. Now surrounded by the yellow fluorescent lights and yellow wallpaper, I took a breath in, tasting nothing in the air, not a single scent was in the air. The air itself, I remembered, was dry and warm-ish, warm enough to feel like you were indoors but not so warm that anyone would complain.

“This is it? We’re actually in THE hotel” Ryan said with star stuck eyes as he wandered in, letting the door come to a close behind him.

Writing this, I see the post is long and listening to my own scared ramblings from the recording is starting to wear on my mind. Even now I’m struggling to accept what happened.
