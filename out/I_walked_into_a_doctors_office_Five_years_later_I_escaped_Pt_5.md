One night, after a particularly difficult day, I lay awake, memorizing my ceiling. My eyes felt like they were spring loaded, popping back open every time I tried to force them shut. Mark told me my case wasn’t going anywhere. They had discovered that there was a Bianca Sinclair from Chicago. She had gone missing 3 years ago. Never found and there were no leads. Another dead end. Michelle was fast asleep on my couch. I could hear the snoring she always denied she made. My life before was completely gone. No pictures. No keepsakes. Nothing to truly prove I am the original me. I gave a sample of my DNA and it was tested against the body and the pieces. They didn’t have the exact DNA as me, but they were “familial” matches, as if we were all siblings. The more we uncovered, the more questions I had.
I turned over on my side, restless and exhausted. I looked out my window to night beyond. Then I screamed. The sound erupted from me as pure, unadulterated fear and panic. I sat bolt upright but could not make myself move from the bed. I was paralyzed with a fear I thought I had left in the dark place. A few moments later, Michelle burst into my room, a kitchen knife in her right hand. She looked wildly around.

“WHAT?!” she yelled, barely audible over my continued cries. I pointed at the window where he had stood. Watching me. Just like he did in the hospital. Michelle ran to the window looked left, right, up, and down. “Nothing is there! Liz! What? Nothing is there? What happened?”

I stopped yelling. Hard, painful gasps ripped through me as I attempted to speak. “The – it… HIM. It was that doctor. H-h-he was watching me!” And I pointed at the window again, with all the accusation I could muster.

Michelle sat down next to me. “Shhh… You’re ok. That doctor is dead. Remember?” She laid her hand on my shoulder, the weight of it was soothing. She was looking away, toward the window, took a deep, steadying breath and then looked straight into my eyes, “You must have imagined it. Or dreamed it. There is no one there.”
“I wasn’t asleep! He was there! Where’s my phone? I have to call Mark.” I insisted, sitting up and reaching to my nightstand for my phone. Michelle reached it before I did, held it close to her chest, and made a hold on kind of gesture.
“Don’t call Mark!” she said quickly.  Then added, more calmly, “Not right now. You know the doctor is dead. You ran right past his body, right? Mark even showed you the picture of his body. He can’t have been at your window.” She was right. Logic was breaking through the fight or flight, and, of course she was right. He was dead. His body was a mangled heap.

But, that little voice chimed in, there’s more than one of you. There could be more than one doctor.
Sleep was foregone conclusion at this point. Michelle seemed agitated. She had always been so solid and reassuring. I reminded myself that I did just wake her in the middle of the night with a not-so gentle panicked screaming alarm. But, she didn’t leave me alone. She urged me to come into living room, watch some TV, maybe eat some junk food, and we could both calm our nerves. She grabbed a bag of chips, a couple sodas, and plopped down on one end of the couch. She still had my phone. She had placed it in the pocket of her pajama pants. She was already on edge, so I didn’t ask for it right away. By the end of the third episode of Friends, we were both able to laugh (if only weakly) at the show, and I casually asked for my phone back.

She eyed me suspiciously for a moment. I put my hands up and assured her, “I won’t call Mark tonight. Promise.” She huffed but pulled my phone from her pocket and handed it over. I won’t call, but I never said I won’t text, I thought. She refocused on the show, and I positioned myself on the couch where my phone was not visible to her, pretending to play a game.

I texted: “Hey Mark. Sorry to bother you so late. It may be nothing, but I could have sworn the doctor was just standing on the balcony outside my bedroom window. Michelle thinks I hallucinated it, but I am almost certain it was real.”

I waited for his reply. He was working nights this week and usually replies quickly. Ten minutes passed. Nothing. Fifteen. Thirty. After an hour, I excused myself to the bathroom and tried calling. No answer. I called his direct line at the station. Voicemail. He had always answered. Always. I took deep breaths, swatting away the worst-case scenario thoughts. He is just busy. He’s a cop. This doesn’t mean something is wrong. A soft knock at the door, “Liz. You good?” I prickled at this. I am in the bathroom. I’m fine. She could give me five minutes alone. I looked again at my silent phone.

“I’m fine,” I said, irritably.

The next day, I went down to the station, still having received no response from Mark. I told Michelle I was running to the store. When I arrived, the whole place was bustling with action. It took a few minutes for anyone to register that I was there. Another officer, one that frequently worked with Mark, spotted me and marched over.
“Ms. LaFleur,” he started, his tone made my stomach drop. “Officer Kesher…Mark…He’s in the hospital. He was shot last night.”

“What?! No! Is he alright?” I was reeling. Is this my fault? It couldn’t be a coincidence the same night I see that… man that Mark gets shot.

“He went out on a domestic call. And when he was getting into his car to come back, someone shot him. He is in critical condition. That’s all we know. He was in surgery for hours,” he told me.
“What hospital? Can I go see him?” I asked. He shook his head.

“Not right now. We have to keep this quiet for now, at least until we have more information. We haven’t even called his family yet. I will call you with updates. I’m sorry, ma’am.” He hung his head, defeated. I drove home in a stupor. I should have called him immediately. If I had called him, maybe…

I walked through my door to find Michelle sitting on my couch, waiting for me. I felt a sudden rush of anger at her.

“WHY?!” I yelled at her. She jumped, alarmed at my outburst. “Why didn’t you let me call him? Why Michelle?” I was sobbing now, all the emotion held at bay broke through and I could barely breathe.

“What are you talking about? Call who? Mark?” She stood up, walking towards me with that same careful calm that I hated in this moment. I didn’t want to be calm. I didn’t want to move on. I wanted my anger. I wanted my pain. It made me feel human. I needed to feel real. She tried to put her hands on my shoulders, I jerked away. Her face looked bitter and angry.

“You can’t blame ME for a cop being shot while on duty! It’s part of their job!” She spit the words at me, but instead of anger, I felt fear. I didn’t immediately understand why what she said rattled me that way. I backed away as the pieces clunked heavily into place.

“I.. I didn’t…” SHUT UP. The voice in my head was setting off alarms. Stop talking. I never said he was shot. It hasn’t been on the news. Only his mother was informed. Get out. Get away now. I tried to recover. How did she know? “I’m sorry, Michelle. I didn’t mean to blame you. I’m just upset,” I said, hoping she bought it. “I think I just need some time…alone…to process this. Ok?”
Her eyes examined me, still wary. Her voice was incredibly level as she replied, “I understand, sweetie. I’ll be at my place if you need anything at all. Alright?” She gave me an awkward hug and walked out. My heart was hammering in my chest so badly it was painful.

If she knows about Mark, what else does she know? Is she really Michelle? If not, then who? And the question I could not escape, the one that haunted my every breath: WHY?

I rushed to my room, slung open the closet, ripping clothes from hangers, dragging clothes from drawers, and stuffing them into a big duffle bag. I had nearly finished packing up the essentials when I heard my door creak open. I held my breath, listening intently. I was in the bathroom. There was a big metal baseball bat in my closet. It was maybe twenty feet from me. I darted out of the bathroom, across my carpeted bedroom floor and into the closet just in time to see a shadow pass by the crack under my bedroom door. I gripped the bat tightly, positioned and poised to swing away. Then I heard Michelle’s voice call out, “Hey Liz! I forgot my purse. I was just grabbing it. Don’t freak out. I’m gonna head back to my apartment. Love you!”

I didn’t say a word. I waited for the sound of the door again. I kept the bat in hand as I grabbed my duffle bag and keys, ready to leave. I didn’t know where I was going to go but anywhere had to be safer than here. I opened my bedroom door and dropped my keys. I bent down to grab them when a foot connected with my chin. I tasted blood and fell backwards. Michelle was standing over me, a needle in her hand.

“Stay still. You couldn’t just leave it alone. Just live your life. MOVE ON? No. They said you were stubborn,” she fumed as she squatted down, intent on injecting me with whatever was in the needle. THE BAT! I remembered it just in time. I swung it as hard as I could. It made a hard, disgusting crack as it met the side of her head. She dropped to the ground, like a ragdoll. There was no blood. Her eyes were wide, unblinking. Her mouth hung open. She’s dead. The thought made me feel relief and overwhelming grief.

“No! No, no, no, no, no, no!! Michelle, please! Wake up!! Please wake up! I’m sorry!” I scrambled over to her, shaking her shoulders, unwilling to accept that she was gone. She was my family. My best friend. This can’t be happening. What did I do?

A cold sweat covered every inch of my skin, and I shivered. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the needle. I smacked it with the bat as if it were a poisonous spider.

This isn’t Michelle. She was going to drug you. Take you back. To THEM. I clumsily got to my feet, shaking violently. I grabbed my keys, the bag, gave “Michelle” one last, sorrowful look before bolting out the door. 

I had to leave her behind. 

I had to leave Mark behind. 

I had to leave all the questions and all my doubts on the floor next to her. 


I had to survive.
