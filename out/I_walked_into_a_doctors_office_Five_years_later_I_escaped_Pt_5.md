Lies. 

She had to be lying. 

Running, hiding was pointless, as it turned out. A sick joke. I had a lovely little tracker inside me the whole time. That’s how Michelle found me. Well, not Michelle. Her name was Nichole. There never was a Michelle. Elizabeth LaFleur never had a cousin named Michelle. That’s what she told me. She told me a lot of things, but none of it can be true. Can it?

The moment I recognized her voice my whole body went rigid. The full spectrum of human emotion spiraled through me and landed on fear. 

“I knew you would freak out when you saw me, so I had to take precautions,” her voice was still low and had a tinge of impatience. “I am sorry, Liz. This isn’t how things should have turned out. I am not the one who attacked you the night you ran. It was my stand-in.”

What? What on earth does that mean? I thought skeptically. I couldn’t speak as her hand was still firmly clamped on my mouth. 

“If I let go, will you stay quiet? Hear me out? I swear I am not going to hurt you,” she asked. What the hell was I supposed to do? I nodded. She hesitated, then her grip slackened. I slipped away from her, trying to see the door through the sea of black within the room. There was a click and the sudden light from the lamp burned through my eyes and stung inside my skull. I was disoriented as my eyes adjusted. I could see the door. Michelle must have predicted my actions and darted between me and the exit. She was too fast. Her face wore a determined scowl, and she pointed to the bed, “Sit down, Liz. Damnit. It’s like trying to talk sense into an anxiety ridden squirrel!” 
I sat. Even through everything, the small nip of petty indignation I felt at being called an anxious squirrel bubbled its way up to the surface, and Michelle smirked at me for a split second. She remained in front of the door but took a step toward me, back in business mode. 

“I know you don’t trust me. You shouldn’t. But I need you to take a leap of faith, Liz. Just one. And then I will tell you what I know. It’s not everything. It might not even be more than you have guessed, but I’ll tell you.”
I remained silent but looked at her expectantly. She cleared her throat and started pacing. 

“Ok. So, I guess the first thing I should tell you is that you have a tracker implanted in you. They have known where you were since before you left the facility,” she began. I started to interrupt, but she held up a finger, “There’s a lot, just let me finish.” She sighed and stopped pacing. There was a heavy chair in the corner of the room, she dragged it to a spot between me and the door, still guarding. 

“Also, I am not Michelle. There never was a Michelle. My name is Nichole. My job was to oversee your transition and assimilation into society. I don’t know the details of the program…just that it was military, and it started with memory implantation, turned into a pseudo cloning project.” She said all of this almost robotically. The last of what she said barely reached my ears. There never was a Michelle. Those words ricocheted in my head like a pinball. I felt a panic attack starting in my chest, the weight was heavy in my bones, threatening to crush me. Michelle…Nichole snapped her fingers at me, “Hey. You with me? We don’t have much time. I gotta get through this. And then we have to get the tracker out of you.”

Wait. 

“Hold on. Tracker out? They want it out? Why?” I interjected. 

“They don’t. I do. I want to help you,” she said, delicately, her face sheepish. My knee-jerk reaction was Bull shit. This is a trick. She knew me too well, and, in reading my face, she said “I am not trying to deceive you… Not anymore. They threatened me, my family. I had no choice. Please believe me.”

This plea for trust, for faith, for belief was ludicrous. “How can I EVER believe anything from you? Not only were you working for the people that ruined my life and stole five YEARS from me – not to mention I don’t even know who ME is! – but you were my family. You were my best friend, and it was ALL A LIE!” I was fuming. Hot, angry tears pricked at the corners of my eyes. I stood and stared at her defiantly, “I HATE YOU!” The last three words I filled with all the venom and vitriol within me, but as I said them, I felt like a petulant teenager screaming at her parents. Some of the contempt I felt left me as I saw she was crying. The tears flowed down her face freely. She was not sobbing, and she made no attempt to wipe them away. 

“I…I am so deeply sorry. You have no idea. I refused to subdue you that night. They knew I slipped up and you were on to me. I refused. They couldn’t let the project fail. They wouldn’t allow me to fail,” the professional tone broke and her voice cracked as she this last thing. She took a shuddering breath, then continued, trying to resume a matter-of-fact cadence. “So, they sent in my double. She is much more…enthusiastic about her role. Plus, she was bitter they chose me to be your babysitter and not her.”

Her double. HER double? No. Bull shit. I made a sharp movement, itching to launch myself at this woman, this imposter – double or not. But before I could do more than twitch, Nichole warned me. “Liz. Stay seated. I don’t want to hurt you. Don’t make me.” That was when I saw the gun and all the air evaporated from my lungs. A lead weight slid into my stomach, and I let out a small whimper in spite of myself. She seemed to pull the damn thing from thin air. One second, she was just sitting in that rickety chair, hands clasped together on her lap, the next there is a gun gripped tightly in her right fist. The way she shifted from raw, emotional, to menacing was unnerving. I could feel the blood surging in my ears, my breath was shallow and quick. My whole body trembled and ached from the attempt to keep calm. I kept my eyes fixed on the dull metal in her hand, fully aware that this person before me held all the cards. But she said she was there to help me. She said she had answers. Fear, anger, recklessness, and caution were battling inside, and my body was held together now by sheer will. 

“Why. The. FUCK. Do YOU have a …double?” I asked angrily, trying to maintain control of every syllable. “And WHY should I believe that you right now aren’t some carbon copy of the bitch I killed in my apartment?” My fingers were painfully digging into my legs as I suppressed the rage boiling up inside me. “How STUPID do you think I am?!” I swallowed hard as these words spewed out of me, terrified I had gone too far. 
Nichole’s head dipped down, while gripping the gun more tightly. She seemed to be struggling to decide what to say next. 

“I worked for the D.O.D. I was transferred to a special research project. Everyone on the team was given a double. It was protocol. Backups. We weren’t supposed to be civilians. It was military. I don’t know what their grand plan was. I was a Marine. We followed orders – didn’t ask questions. That was phase three of their experiment. You were phase four. Taking civilians and doubling them. And phase five. Sending them back out to see what worked. You weren’t the first success in phase four, but you were to be the first in phase five.”

My head was spinning. This was insanity. Despite the things I had seen, the things I already knew, I still could not wrap my mind around this. I slumped forward, elbows on my knees, hands on my face, forgetting Nichole and her gun entirely for a brief moment. I couldn’t know anymore. My brain was full. How much – if any – was true? And the question I had been longing to find an answer to finally passed my lips. In barely more than a whisper, I asked, “Am I really Elizabeth LaFleur?” I looked up at Nichole, eager to see the answer in her expression or body language before it came from her mouth. She shifted uncomfortably, her eyebrows pulled together, and her eyes narrowed, preparing for bad news. She relaxed the hand with the gun and said, “I don’t know.”

Those three words hit me like a punch to the gut. This was the closest I had gotten to the truth, but it was as elusive as a laugh in the mist. I could not take anything Nichole said at face value. Her every action was a contradiction. Cloak and dagger meeting and she attacks me at the door. She wants to help and give me answers but holds me here at gunpoint. I felt stuck in an endless nightmare – the infuriating kind where a monster is chasing you, but you can’t force your legs to move fast enough. With a feeble, childish hope, I pinched myself to see if maybe it was all a dream. No luck. And that fucking hurt. 
The silence in the room had gone on for too long. The air grew thick with unspoken words and bottled-up emotions. Nichole seemed to be lost for words. 
Finally, I broke the silence. 

“I didn’t escape.” It wasn’t a question. Nichole shook her head. “The thing…woman… that saved me then? Who was that?”

Nichole’s business-like façade broke. She looked everywhere but at me and finally let out a grunt of frustration. “I don’t know. I was never supposed to be part of this phase! There was never supposed to be a phase four. Or five! Everything just… got out of control. I asked questions way too late in the game. I objected to the use of unwitting civilians. So, they threatened my brother… and…and my mother.” The tears were coming in earnest now. A pang of empathy rushed through me, and I wanted so badly to go hug her before remembering this wasn’t my friend. This was never my friend. I watched her face crumple, her shoulders drawn forward as she tried to regain composure. She looked down at the hand still griping the gun and seemed surprised by its presence. She looked briefly back at me and hung her head. “I am sorry. I don’t expect you to forgive me. I would be astounded if you did,” she said as she made a show of putting the gun back in the holster at her side. 
I didn’t relax at this. I felt even more on edge. Was this calculated? My nerves were fried – some raw, some totally numb. I couldn’t tell what I felt. I was drowning. Then I asked, “Why - WHY did they let me run that night? Why haven’t they caught up to me?” Her answer was a hollow, humorless laugh. 

“They don’t want to catch you. They don’t need to. You’re like a dog in one of those invisible fences,” she said flatly. I had been running, hiding for NOTHING. Does a lab rat in a maze think it’s hiding from the giants that treat it so cruelly? I was pathetic. I had felt so many things during all of this, but this was the first time I actually felt hopeless, overwhelmingly defeated. Nichole trudged on, unaware of my mental upheaval. 
“They don’t care how you spend your time as long as you aren’t poking around for answers. You being on the run meant you wouldn’t kick over any rocks. They are well beyond the bounds of sanctioned government work, and no one wants light shed on any of this. If you had stayed, playing detective with Mark, you would both be dead. I would be too, probably.”

“So, you what? Suddenly got religion? Heart grew three sizes? Why now? Why do you care now?” I asked, accusation dripping from each syllable.

“My…mother… died.” The words hung in the air like the last note played at a funeral. She opened her mouth but closed it again, unable to continue. 
I could have said I was sorry for her loss. I could have offered platitudes and made a vain attempt to console her, but I could not traverse the bitter sea between us. The bridges had all burned. We sat saying nothing for several minutes. I jumped when she suddenly went on.

“It was a week ago. Heart attack according to the coroner’s report, but she was healthy. They did it … They… They did it because… I failed to follow orders.” The grief was powerful, it rolled off of her in waves and crashed into me unapologetically. “FUCK THEM! You were MY friend, too, damn it! It was built on lies, I know…But…The day to day…was still me, Liz.”

I wanted to believe her. I wanted to stop being alone. What were my options now? Keep running when no matter where I went, a tiny beeping dot betrayed my location? Go home? I had no home – just those four walls filled with tainted memories. Did I really care to live or die at this point? The truth was part of me wished for death – a clean, peaceful end. Just like falling asleep. I could truly rest, ready and rested for whatever happened after this life. So, if I trusted her, what was the worst thing that could happen? Dying? I let go of that particular fear. Whether I trusted her or not, whether she was helping me or herself were issues that paled in comparison to the ominous people that set all of this in motion. My goal was to escape. I had been trying to do just that since the moment I could feel my toes again. This familiar stranger might actually be the next crucial step in succeeding. There were no good options. I could wring my hands and worry about this choice or just fucking make it. I stood up slowly, deliberately. I sighed and looked her straight in the eyes. “Ok. Get this thing out of me.”

I could tell, no matter what she had hoped, she did not think I would let her help me (if she was truly helping). She sniffed, wiped her eyes with her fingertips and then her nose with the back of her sleeve. She was shaking more than I was, but she didn’t let it slow her down. She got to work, rushing over to a big, black, canvas bag stuffed in the corner of the room. She pulled out some equipment I didn’t recognize, I long scalpel like knife, a couple bottles of fluid, and a large white cloth from a thin blue plastic bag. She had a metal tray and placed her tools upon it and laid the tray on the bedside table. She looked at me, apprehensively, “I sterilized the bed as much as possible before you got here. The drape is as sterile as anything can be outside an O.R. But, Liz, I couldn’t get any kind of anesthesia. I have some topical spray that will numb you somewhat, but it won’t do much more than that. This…This is going to hurt. A lot. And you cannot move. It’s in the back of your neck, and I am not a surgeon. I only have a little field training in medicine. If you move when the knife or the extractor go in, it could hit your spine…”

The weight of the consequences still rocked me. Dead I could do, but paralyzed? Living AND immobile? I had to steel myself for this. I honestly did not know if I could take it. But I had to. This was my choice, and now it’s time to act. “Well,” I told her, my voice quavering, “If that happens, kill me. Please. Don’t let me go on like that.” And I climbed onto the bed, laying on my stomach. Her eyes were wide, mouth slightly open, as if she wasn’t quite sure she could make good on that. I pulled my hair up and away from the nape of my neck and she snapped out of it, refocusing on the job at hand. 

“One last thing. Once this comes out, they are going to know, and they will be here in a matter of minutes. They only sent me out here to keep tabs on you. I wasn’t supposed to make contact. I have a support team less than an hour away. We will have maybe ten minutes to stitch you up and get the hell out of Dodge. I have a bottle of hydros in my bag if you need something for pain, but you can’t take anything until we are well away from here. Got it?” she explained. It was an even tone, but the panic crept in, and I felt the urgency in her words. 

“I got it. Do it.”
