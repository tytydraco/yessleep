This has been eating me and I have to take this off my chest. Back when I was around 7 or 8, I always wanted to be an explorer, exploring places man had never tread. When I was 20 I came across a large sum of money and quit college to explore my childhood dream. It worked out for several years, where I explored places such as the Amazon, Himalayas, and I even traveled to the North Pole. A few years ago I took my last trip. 

It had been a few months after crossing the Sahara and I felt like taking a break from these dangerous places and have a nice, relaxing trip. Me and 4 friends bought plane tickets, packed out bags, and flew to Pennsylvania. When we arrived in the airport, we rented a car, got some last minute supplies, and drove the rest of the way into the mountains. On the way we decided that we would travel down to Alabama where we would then travel home from there.

Once we arrived in the mountains we said goodbye to John, who would be taking the car to where we would end, and began walking. For several days we walked, set up camp, hunted for food, and had fun. About 10 days in, as we were making camp, a herd of deer began grazing nearby. One of us, I forgot who, shot at them, killing one to eat later. Most of the deer ran after the gunshot, but one stayed behind for a few seconds before catching up. Before that one ran, i swear it stared right at me. I couldn’t move for what felt like hours, stuck in place by what felt like fear, but I did not know what or why I feared it at the time, but looking back I understand that it was because it’s eyes were wrong. They were staring forward, not of the side of its head but on the front.

After this happened, me and the others joked about how that deer was fearless, or how it was deaf and didn’t hear the gunshot. After this we retrieved the deer carcass, cut it up for storage, and at around 10 PM we settled in our camp for the night and drifted off. I remember waking up in the middle of the night to chewing. It sounded wet and mushy, like eating raw meat. It came from the direction that we hid the food and assumed that some animal got into the deer we killed. I knew that trying to fight an animal eating wasnt a good idea so I just hoped that there would be enough left to eat in the morning and went back to sleep.

When we woke up in the morning we found nearly half the deer gone, with only one set of prints. 

“What animal could eat half a deer?” I asked, not expecting an answer.

“Maybe a bear. It is nearing fall so they could be getting ready for winter.” Jakob, one of my friends replied. 

“Wait, look at the tracks. Doesnt that look like hooves?” Alex said, confusion cutting across his face. “Wait a minute, theres also only 2 feet on these prints. It was walking on only 2 legs. What kind of deer does that?” Alex added, fear mixing with his previous confusion.

We all decided to leave sooner than later, wanting to get distance between us and whatever did this. We packed much quicker than we did the previous days. To this day I still can’t find some of the pieces to my tent, which were probably left here in our hurry. We also traveled much faster than the previous days. Over the next few days we traveled across the mountains. Several times I could have sworn I saw a single deer in the corner of my eye, but When I looked it was gone. Every couple days we found the half eaten body of an animal near our camp, which none of us remember being there when we set it up. 

On the final day of travel, we decided not to set up camp and to hike through the night so we could get to the end of our trip faster and see John. Near the middle of the night, Jakob had strayed behind us. 

“Guys, do you see that?” Jakob asked sleepily. “It kind of looks like a deer, but it’s, WHAT THE-“ we turned around just in time to see him be taken into the forest by something we couldn’t make out. We both began running as fast as we could, hoping that we could make it to the end before we got taken as well. After what felt like hours of running, we found what looked to be a human skull in our path, cracked and broken, as if to get inside. Blood was still clinging onto it. We began to run harder, but Alex tripped on a root. I didn’t look back. I kept running until by some miracle I reached the car that John was sleeping inside. I began banging on the door to get him to wake up. He unlocked the door and asked

“Where are the others? Why were you running?”

“JUST DRIVE. THEYRE GONE. DEAD.” I screamed. Just as the car turned on a deer on 2 legs, the very same I saw on that fateful day, ran into view. John sped away as I watched the deer stop, get on all fours, and walk deeper into the mountains.
