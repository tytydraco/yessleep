I met my wife at a hotel bar in Chicago. 



It was the first time my work had sent me so far from home and my first time entirely on my own. I like what I do. I think I’m good at it. Sometimes, though, this feeling comes over me and I realize I’m not anywhere near grown up enough for it. Like when I was a kid and my parents left me in charge of my sister, and I slowly worked out that if something went wrong it was all on me to fix it. I hate that feeling. I hate it like bad breath or a stomach bug or the way my back gets worse every year. It wasn’t on me yet, but I could feel the anxious tension run its fingers through my hair, so despite myself I made my way downstairs in need of a distraction.



To my credit, I found one.



She was the only other person there. I lingered outside. I looked for anyone else. I couldn’t shake this neurotic thought that the whole bar was hers and that I’d be imposing by going inside. Still, it had been a long day. I wanted to forget that phone call I was going to have to make tomorrow morning. The one where I’d try and sound optimistic as I told my boss I’d made no progress, and cringe when he told me that was fine and to do my best. ‘Do your best’ is what you say when you expect someone to fail. 



That looming death sentence was enough to get me through the door. 



To my surprise, I took the seat next to her. When a man says he would do anything for a woman, what he normally means is that he’d fight a dragon or save her from terrorists, something like that. He doesn’t mean the hard things, like remembering her sister’s birthday or telling her that he sometimes feels inadequate and that’s why he doesn’t like to go on nice dates. But when I looked over at her, caught her eyes on me as she toyed with her glass, I thought I really would have done anything for her, just for that moment. So I did. I asked her a question.



“Any good?” I said, and I eyed the cocktail that reminded me of somewhere faraway and warm.



“What?” she asked. She looked at me like scenery out a car window on a long drive.



“Your drink,” I said again. “Is it any good?”



“Oh. Not really, no.”



“I think I’ll have one then,” I said. “I’d love something mediocre tonight.”



She raised an eyebrow at me.



“And you’re hoping that’s the mood I’m in too,” she said, but before I could find it in me to be embarrassed she gave me the ghost of a flirtatious smile. Or maybe I only thought I saw it, passing out of sight.



“Seven o’clock on a Tuesday, here, dressed like that,” I said. “Seemed like a given you would be.”



Then she really did smile at me, and when I took my drink and did my damndest to look unimpressed by it, there was something in her eyes that made my heart hammer.



I don’t remember exactly when we left the bar, but it was late. Just on the edge of irresponsible. She held my hand and made it wet with the spilled cocktail she’d tried to wipe off the bar-top. The look she gave me was an animal kind of hungry, and I realized I had found more than a distraction. 



We were in the lobby, drifting, for a few long moments. It smelled like liquor and ozone. She was there in front of me, and I saw the whole cosmos in the lines and angles of her face for an instant.  Then she was pulling me on, towards the elevator. 



Sometimes I catch her doing dishes or smiling while she sleeps and my mind stops and I’m there again.



I asked what her room was.



She told me this wasn’t her hotel. 



My train of thought took that turn a bit too hard and wobbled. Its destination had been clear for the last hour, but now it was hazed. Ambiguous. The wheels tried and failed to turn. I still wonder how things would have gone if I was sober. What I would have noticed. All I managed was:



“Where are you staying then?”



“With you,” she said, and that was enough to remind me of why I was there and what I was doing.



I was alone on this trip. No supervisor in the other bed, or even across the hall. I think that had been the whole point of sending me, actually. To see if I was one of the people who would lose it without a leash. I still wasn’t sure. I wasn’t even considering what they might say about my guest, only that there had been no one to stop me from making a mess of the place and that I hoped we were too drunk for that to matter. 



I kept running through that mental checklist as she kissed me in the elevator, things I would have done or should have done had I known where the night would end. Not consciously, mind. I was too concerned with how soft and warm she felt and how much my lizard brain liked that. But that little voice in the back of my mind had its own priorities.



Were the books put away?



Had I organized my notes and slipped them beneath that special bathroom tile with the ward?



Where was my gun?



I didn’t know. I didn’t care. But that little part of me kept tick, tick, ticking away on layover. Like it knew it would be needed. Like it was important. 



When the elevator door opened I had to pry her off me for fear of some poor custodian or late-returning guest seeing her on the verge of consuming me. Even like that I wasn’t beyond embarrassment, thank God. She stared at me, blank, for a long moment, and then I tumbled after as she led me to my room. I remember being thankful she knew it without needing to tell her.



I fished in my pockets for the key, fumbling and desperate all the more for how long it was taking. I hated to delay but a part of me relished how palpable her excitement was. Anticipation. I could feel it, really, physically feel it building on the nape of my neck somehow. I almost thought she was touching me, but it kept growing.



So damn intense.



So forceful.



Like an ice pick.



She just stood there, watching. I began to grit my teeth. My fingers strained for purchase on the key, still damp enough to get in my way, enough to make me feel like I was going to snap under that pressure on my neck, and then suddenly I was in, out of that hallway, amid the familiar debris of my life, and I could breathe again. 



I fell onto the bed, panting. I felt like I wanted to cry with relief. I was so exhausted, so confused, so out of my depth. What had just happened? I hadn’t heard her come in after me, but then I felt her fingers run through my hair and her nails graze my scalp. It was electric, and for a moment my aching left me. But there was still that feeling. The anticipation. I’d had too much of it, I was bloated and sick. I couldn’t handle whatever was next, good or ill. She could though. I could hear her behind me, back and forth, watching. 



There was that little voice again.



Where are your books?



Where are your notes?



Where is your gun?



Where is your gun?



Where is your gun?



The room was silent. I lay there, unmoving, and forced myself to breathe. Do you ever wonder what it must feel like for mice that are caught in those glue traps? I do. All the time. I was the mouse. I’d been lured in by the scent of something I thought I liked and now I lay there, trapped, able to do nothing but shit and scream and gnaw at my limbs until I was crushed under a boot and tossed in a bag. I could feel her lining up, checking her aim, making sure I was where she wanted. The anticipation! Every millisecond was a lifetime, drawing on and on and on, and I couldn’t even bring myself to look, to see what ungodly fate awaited me. 



Then I knew. I understood. It wasn’t a raised boot, it was a poised fork. I could feel its teeth on my neck, skewering me. She was excited about this. She was just as excited as I had been, a thousand times more! She was hungry. She was so fucking hungry because she had come such a long way, made such a long fucking drive just to come here and so this. To eat me. To drop me into her mouth and splinter my femurs between her teeth and burst my organs like ravioli. 



Not scenery out the window, I was a pitstop. Something to tide her over before she kept on her way.



I couldn’t move. I was red in the face, shaking so badly in my efforts not to scream out. I could feel her, the teeth ringing her open mouths, the thousand roving hands she used to hold me down, her great, slithering shape tense as she prepared to swallow me whole. I was the mouse! I was dead! I was breaking into pieces! I was -



“Food!” 



I jumped like a spring and spun round, hysteric, ready to wail in the face of oblivion hunger. She hardly even noticed me, and when I watched her bite into a half-eaten burger I fled to the bathroom. 



I vomited up blood and bile and cried silent tears as my throat burned. I sat stooped there like that over the toilet for an age, and then I felt her over me again. I cried harder. She knelt next to me, ran a hand, soft and concerned, down my back. She cooed and held me as I emptied my stomach and then my bladder. 



I couldn’t feel the hunger, though I knew it was still there somewhere, hidden. There was just concern. Empathy. Affection. 



“You poor thing,” she said. She ran her fingers through my hair. “I should never have let you drink so much. I bet you feel like shit right now.”



I nodded, defeated, and spent the night there with her in the bathroom until my stomach was empty and she showered me and put me to sleep.



We’ve been married for fifteen years now.



We have two kids.



A nice house near Albany. 



I’m at the pinnacle of my career, even though I lied and told them I didn’t find what they had me searching for on that trip. Told them I hadn’t lost it like all the washouts did. 



I’ve only been back to Chicago once. Our tenth anniversary. It’s a touching story that gets shared around now, how on our first night together my wife nursed me through the consequences of far too much drinking. I smile along, tell everyone that I’m lucky to have found her, even though privately I am certain she was the one who found me.



She loves it when I cook for her, and I love that she enjoys my food so much. If I ever retire I would open a restaurant. That’s what I go on about when I do drink now: being a restaurateur. It’s a good distraction from work and the rest of it. When I go a bit overboard, she’s always there for me, just like she was the first time. Even if there are too many hands rubbing my back, too many mouths to speak soothing words, I still love her for it. 



I know she loves me too. 



Whenever she sees me, I can always feel the anticipation.
