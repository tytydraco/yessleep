&#x200B;

In a flash, the Curator was over the exhibit's wall and rushing toward us. That was all I took in before collapsing to the floor as I cried out through gritted teeth. Shivering through every bone was aching pain that seized my muscles and held me immobile. It only lasted a moment, however, and soon the agony melted down into a gentle vibration as my arm was once again reunited with its socket. As soon as I regained the function of my muscles, I looked up to assess the danger. The beast was towering directly over me but didn't seem interested. Instead, it stared down Alice with wild eyes.

"It's okay! Calm down!" She pleaded in a desperate tone. "I was just helping him, see? Helping. Not hurting. See?" She talked slow and gently, almost like a mother would speak to her child. I half expected the curator to ignore her in a ceaseless fit of anger, but oddly enough, it turned to me as if listening to the woman.

Doing my best to pick up on Alice's queues, I nodded and forced a smile through the belt still in my teeth, then attempted to raise my arm. It certainly moved, but at the cost of another wave of searing pain through my body. I choked back the grunt and just focused the sting into my smile.

"See? Fixed. Helped." Alice said, flashing a warm grin.

The Curator cocked its head as if analyzing the information it had just received, then clacked its teeth twice before reaching forward to the woman. Ethan stepped forward, and I jumped to my feet, ready to do our best to intervene, but to our surprise, the creature didn't hurt her or try to snatch her up. Instead, it extended its long fingers to the sides of her cheeks and gently let them drag over a pair of hoop earrings that she was wearing. It played a tiny flourish of notes with its other hand before vaulting the wall and returning to its junk.

Ethan turned to Alice with a wide mouth and said the same thing I was thinking, "What on Earth was that?"

"It's very protective of its pets." Alice replied, "That includes when we hurt each other."

"I kind of gathered that part. I more meant that you just told it something and it... listened to you?"

Alice nodded, "I told you I've been down here with it for a while. I wouldn't say I have a connection with it, but I've started to understand how it thinks."

"I didn't realize it thought at all. It seems so… feral."

"It hardly does, but you can still see some sort of emotion in it. The way it takes care of us and likes to collect things. It's like a young infant trapped in a horrifically strong body."

"I wish I could say that helps me feel less repulsed by it."

"Don't worry. In all my time here, it hasn't helped me feel any different." Alice looked back to me, "How's your arm? Better?"

I nodded, "Much better."

"Good. Try to avoid moving it a lot. It will still need to heal."

"Will do. Thank you, Alice."

The woman looked shyly to the floor, dropping back into her awkward state, "Um, yeah. Yeah, no problem."

"So you've been all alone down here for six years?" Ethan asked. "How have you not gone insane."

Alice shrugged, "I can't say that I haven't. It often feels like it. But I wasn't always alone. There were others with me when we first arrived, then another showed up later. That was once I was alone again, though, and she managed to escape not long after arriving."

"Everyone left you?"

"No. Only the girl who came later made it out. Everyone else broke the rules." She said, barely glancing up to the 'BAD PET' exhibit.

"It's never tried to hurt you?" I questioned.

"No. No, I do my best to behave. Of course, I have made it mad a few times, but it's never gotten rid of me." Alice reached up and touched the earrings that the Curator had shown interest in. "I think it's only because of the earrings. I think it doesn't realize they're not actually a part of my body. If it did, it might not have a reason to keep me around."

"Weird…" Ethan muttered.

"What about you two? You said you were looking for a friend. Is it just you three?"

I looked off to the side and bit the tip of my tongue, "It is now. We came down with four, but we lost one along the way. We were looking for the exit."

"I'm sorry to hear that," Alice said somberly. After a moment, however, she continued, "The exit, huh? So it really does exist?"

"Wait, you mean you all didn't even know if it existed?"

"No. No, not for sure. Our friend started to dream of it a few years in, though. She said every week, she would see a plain metal door with one of those green emergency exit signs above it while she slept. She told us it was beneath the house, but she didn't know where or how far. We obviously didn't take it as prophecy at first, but as the years went on and more of us began to go insane, we decided that our only option was to start moving down and hope we found it. As you can tell, that plan didn't quite work out so well…."

Ethan looked very troubled by what she had just told us. He didn't push into anything, however, and instead just followed up with a gentle, "I'm sorry, Alice,"

"It's alright, I think. There were five of us left when me and a couple of others got separated and brought here. I'll never know what happened to the two that got away, but I like to imagine they made it out."

"I'm sure they did," I added.

"So one of you must have had the dream, too, then? Is that why you went looking?"

"Uh, no. No dreams." Ethan dismissed quickly.

"Um, yeah, no dreams," I tossed in, looking at him quizzically. He avoided eye contact. "We do have others upstairs, though, still in the rooms above ground. One of them made a radio out of parts the Curator brought us, and when we turned it on, there was a signal telling us that the exit was down here somewhere."

Alice pursed her lips in thought. "Hmm. That's quite interesting…."

"We weren't going to follow it, but our friend actually came down before us, um, on her own… She found it then came back up to tell us."

"Oh my. She found it and didn't leave? That's very selfless of her."

"That's just the kind of person she was," Ethan said.

"If she found it, then why didn't you all come back down together?"

"Well, she…" I started, "She got hurt on the way back to us. She got to the top just in time to tell us before she passed. We trusted that there really was an exit, but we wanted to figure out exactly where before we pulled everyone into danger. We were making a map, but that was before we learned that the rooms change."

Alice looked off toward the corner of the room, deep in thought, before asking, "The girl; your friend-- what was her name?"

"Um, Andi. Why?"

Her eyes lit up, but then went through several different emotions before she responded, "I… I think I knew her. I knew Andi."

&#x200B;

Ethan, Bea, and I sat in the living room and stared forward at the wall ahead. Around the house, we could hear everyone else sitting in their own rooms and having hushed conversations while we all waited.

"This is all too soon," Bea muttered.

"Yeah," I whispered.

"It'll be alright, guys," Ethan said gently, though his tear-stained eyes said otherwise. His turn had just gotten done, and now Grace was currently in the bedroom. "He doesn't want us to be sad."

"That's easier said than done," Bea said, leaning on her knees.  After a few more minutes of silent murmurs throughout the house, the door to the room opened, and Grace stepped out, wiping tears from her eyes.

"Bea, honey. He wants to see you next."

Bea took a shaky breath, and I placed a hand on her arm.

"It's okay. It'll be okay."

She nodded and stood, then walked into the bedroom and closed the door, leaving Ethan and me alone. I fidgeted with my hands as we sat there. Bea was the only other person who hadn't been called besides me. That meant that I had to go last, and while it was no different than going at any other point, something about the concept made me incredibly nervous.

"How are you feeling?" Ethan asked from my side.

I shrugged, "Defeated. I mean, I guess we all kind of knew, right? He wasn't getting any better, but… It doesn't make it hurt any less."

"Are you going to be okay? Like, when he… You know."

"Are any of us?" I said with a weak chuckle.

"That's fair. But I mean, you aren't going to, like… I know things have been hard for you since Andi and-"

I interrupted him with more soft laughter. Ethan tried his best but always struggled with emotional stuff. "Bea told you, didn't she?"

He looked shamefully at the floor, "Yeah… Please don't be mad at her, dude. She just was worried about you and wanted me to keep my eye on you as well-"

"Ethan, it's okay; I'm not upset. Not that I'd have any right to be, but… I meant to tell you anyway, I just… I didn't know how."

"What do you mean? You can tell me anything, man."

"I know, but with that kind of thing- I don't know, it's just embarrassing. It was so selfish of me, and I knew you'd be upset."

"Well, yeah, of course, I was upset, but not angry or anything. I just wish you would have told me how you had been feeling."

"I know. I'm sorry…."

"It's alright. I understand. Just promise me you'll talk to me, man?"

"Of course. Yeah."

There was a long round of silence while we both breathed a sigh of relief, dispelling the tension. The next time Ethan spoke, it was to catch me wildly off guard.

"So, you and Bea, huh?"

"What?"

"Oh, nothing, I just thought that you guys were- I noticed she's been sleeping next to you, I just thought-"

"Oh, no, it's not really anything. She just- I mean, I think she's just doing it because she's afraid I'll try and run out again. She's been watching me like a hawk."

"Oh, I see. So it's not like… you know?"

"No! Nah, don't worry."

"Oh, I mean, it wouldn't bother me if you guys were. I just was curious." Ethan laughed nervously.

"No, not at all. I don't know if that would be a good idea so soon after Andi…"

"Oh, yeah, of course."

"Yeah."

After that, we didn't say another word. Just sat in silence and listened to the conversations around us until the bedroom door opened and Bea stepped out, wiping tears from her eyes.

"Joel," She said, nodding to me.

Ethan sighed next to me and patted my back as I stood, and Bea caught me in a hug on my way to the door. My heart thundered in my chest. I had already seen him this morning, and yet I was still horrified to have to see him now. There were so many points in my life that I had wished I had known when my last conversation with someone would be. Maybe then I would have said something different, or paid more attention, or cherished it more. But now that I actually had the opportunity, I had no words, I couldn't think straight, and all I felt was despair. Nevertheless, it was time, and ready or not, it was my turn to say goodbye to Mark.

&#x200B;

"A bus? You just blacked out, and then you were here?"

"Yep. No memory in between either."

"And none of you knew any of each other?"

"No, not until that first day. We were complete strangers."

Alice listened intently and nodded along, analyzing the data in her head.

"What about your group?" Ethan asked, "How'd you guys end up here?"

"Oh, well, it was similar, I think- although we knew one another. We had just finished an exam, and my class had gone out to celebrate at this bar; we were all really close. Eventually, it got so late that everyone else in the place left except for us and the bartender. After another hour or so, we all remember blacking out, and then we woke up here, same as you."

"Strange." Ethan pondered.

"At first, we thought we had been drugged, but when we saw the bartender was with us, we knew something was wrong. Imagine being hungover and waking up in a moldy, damp abandoned house in the middle of nowhere. Then that thing starts pounding on the door." Alice said, gesturing to the curator. "Worst morning of my life."

"It's weird," I started, "I've never seen it sleep before. I didn't know it even did."

Behind the glass, we could see the Curator in a mangled heap on the ground, unmoving and eyes still wide open. Although, I suppose there wasn't much it could do about that without eyelids.

"It rarely does, but every now and then, it just collapses and is out for a while. I can only assume that what it's doing."

I turned back to Alice and swallowed, "I hate to keep asking you so many questions, but you said you knew Andi?"

Alice nodded, "She was the last person I ever saw since you two. One day the Curator dragged her down here with me, and that was that for a couple of months. She was very kind and talked about you all an awful lot. Especially you, Joel." I felt the familiar hollow feeling of guilt enter my stomach. It never stopped hurting to think about how much Andi endured while, meanwhile, I thought she was dead. "It was nice to have company again. I really missed her when she left."

"Speaking of which," Ethan started, "How did she escape? You said that it's nearly impossible to get out of here before the Curator notices."

Alice looked down at the floor with sorrow-filled eyes, "I um. I helped her. We waited until the creature was gone one day, and then I vaulted her over the exhibit wall from that rock over there."

Ethan and I looked to a spot at the edge of the exhibit where part of the stone raised up higher than the rest. It looked like a covered area for the animals. It would be easy to vault over the wall from so high up if not for the massive amounts of junk barricading the space in between.

"Once she was up, she hauled me up too, and then we ran. The problem was that neither of us had been on this floor before being taken here. It's large, so much bigger than the rest of the house, and all of the rooms don't make sense anymore. They're just repetitive stretches of dead ends or nonsensical spaces. It was like one big maze to us, but the Curator knew every inch of the place. It started to catch up, and I knew we wouldn't make it. I had seen it all happen before…." Alice shifted nervously and reached up to her ear, gently twirling the golden hoops that dangled lazily. "It had always favored me, so I told her to hide and that I would lead it off. She tried to argue, but I insisted. I knew she had all of you to get home to. I didn't have anyone."

Ethan and I looked at her with empathy. The poor woman… She noticed us staring and sat straight up.

"S-sorry. That was a lot. But the point is she escaped, at least from the sound of it."

"She did, thanks to you, Alice. You have no idea how much we all owe you."

"You don't owe me anything. It was the right thing to do. I just am sad to hear about what happened to her. She was a good friend." She said, brushing hair from her face. I could tell by her body language that she was beginning to get more uncomfortable than she already was.

"I'm sorry to have brought it up," I told her. "Today has been heavy as it is. Should we rest for the night?"

I could see relief wash over her face, "Oh, um, yeah. Of course. Over here."

She led us over to a small area tucked away between a nook of fake foliage and an artificial cave. A sprawl of blankets was laid out across the floor, covering most of the stone. On a few flat indents of the wall, Alice had neatly stacked books and magazines that she had presumably collected over the years. Decorated about the area were also various nick-nacks and stuffed animals. It was shockingly quaint for such a dingy zoo exhibit. She walked over to a stack of pillows and grabbed a few, handing them to us.

"Here, I have some extra pillows. You can have my blanket too, but it may not be enough. Feel free to pull some up from the floor, though. I apologize if they're a little damp. I didn't think I'd need them for company again…."

I stepped forward and took the pillows from her. "Thank you, Alice. We'll be fine without blankets. You hang onto yours."

She nodded, then smiled, "Goodnight, you two. We'll talk more in the morning."

Ethan and I crossed to the other side of the cave to give the woman her space, then set down our pillows. As we got situated, I could hear Alice behind us muttering something. When I glanced over my shoulder, I noticed that she was talking to a few stuffed animals, but she suddenly caught my eye and quickly stopped. I tried to play it off like I didn't notice and slipped off my jacket. It was strange. All this time, I had always laid awake at night imagining what may be below us, and all along, there had been another person just living down here. I couldn't imagine how lonely she must have been.

As I nestled into the spot I had prepared, I noticed Ethan was looking out of the nook at a service door in the wall. We both knew it was locked, but I could tell he had more than that on his mind.

"Hey," I started. He turned to me. "We'll find a way out, okay? As soon as that thing leaves, we'll make a break for it and find Bea. Then we'll get to that exit and get everyone home."

Ethan smiled reassuredly, but I could see that his eyes were vacant. Distant. Something was bothering him, but I knew he wouldn't tell me. "Yeah, man. Yeah, of course."

Eventually, we were all lying down, and I found myself a new ceiling to stare at. I certainly wasn't going to sleep for at least a couple days, if we even lived to see that long. The image of Bea impaled and falling kept repeatedly looping in my mind, relentless stabbing at my heart. Her eyes looked so desperate like Rose's, and her hand on my cheek had been so tender, like Andi's. I couldn't lose her. We had to get back to her.

After about an hour, I heard Ethan stir next to me. I turned to him, but he didn't look in my direction. Instead, he quietly stood and crept out of the cave. I debated letting him have his time alone, but I knew he needed a friend right now.

"You want to talk about it?" I said softly, pushing past the fake, mold-covered plants and sitting next to him on the stone ledge.

He shrugged, "There's not much to talk about. You know the score just as well as I do."

I laughed, "Yeah. I guess so. But there's more on your mind, isn't there?"

He looked down at his shoes and lightly kicked his heel against the stone.

"Is it about Alice?"

He shook his head.

"Are you having dreams again?" this time, he looked at me like I had just read his mind. "When Alice told us about her friend dreaming of the exit, you seemed upset."

Ethan sighed deeply, then spoke, "It's the same dream that's got me all over. The one I was having a while back? I have it almost every other night."

"You never did tell me what it was about."

He shifted nervously and then, after a long pause, began speaking. "Way back before Daniel's room, I had a dream that he 'died'. I mean, it was vague. There was a lot to the whole dream, but in part of it, I was drifting through this black murk with him, and then he looked at me with these sad, soul-crushing eyes before slowly fading into the darkness."

"Holy crap," I muttered.

"Yeah. And you know, that could mean anything, but I could tell, I could just feel it, that it meant he wasn't going to make it somehow. I told him about it one night, but he told me not to worry, That he would be fine. Then we got to his room, and everything started unfolding, and it wasn't until I was looking through that sheet of ice that I realized the dream wasn't a dream. It was a premonition."

I sat silently and looked at him, unable to process a response. After a moment, I came up with, "Why did you not tell me all this?"

"I thought they were just nightmares at first, but after Daniel, I knew. At that point, though, I was afraid. I started having different ones. There was one where we gave up. We tried to go back to the surface and got torn apart by a creature made entirely out of arms. That's why I didn't want us to turn back after the maps. And do you remember those cans of fruit we found with those cherries? And I insisted that we don't eat anything other than those?"

"Yeah, why?"

"I had a dream we ate a feast together. This big beautiful table just loaded with food. It was delicious, and for dessert, there was fresh fruit. One kind for each can we found. I had the cherries, and you and Bea had the peaches and pears. In your first bites, you began bleeding from your mouths and died on the spot. I thought I would too, but I was fine."

I shuddered at his description. While all of this information would have been very nice to know ourselves, I could see why he didn't want to tell us. It was deeply disturbing.

"That's the main reason I know Bea isn't dead. A lot of the dreams blur together, and I'll have multiple a night, but they always end the same." He hesitated before continuing, "She makes it to the exit. I see us standing before a shining door, and the light is so bright I can't see the other side. But it's warm, and welcoming, and real, and Bea is the first one to go forward and step through it." Ethan looked me dead in the eyes with complete certainty, "I know it's real, Joel. It hasn't come to pass yet, which means there's still a chance."

I took a long while to process everything he had just said, but I soon smiled, "I Believe you, man. I do."

He smiled back, then looked off through the window at the unconscious Curator. I joined his view, then waited a second before speaking again, "Is there anything else I should know? Any important dreams you've had? I can handle it, Ethan."

"No. Not yet, at least."

"Do you promise?"

He chuckled to himself, "Yes, Joel. I promise. The cat's out of the bag now. No point of hiding anything."

I nodded, then looked around the room. "Well, since both of us are already up and probably not sleeping anytime soon, what do you say we get a head start on finding a way out of this hole?"

"You read my mind, buddy." He shot back with a smirk.

&#x200B;

I stepped into the room and turned around, gently pushing the door closed. I stared at the yellowed white paint and studied the artificial wood grain as a momentary distraction. I didn't know how to bring myself to look at him. I knew the sight was going to hurt. Sure enough, as I looked to Mark, my heart sunk. He lay on a soft throne of blankets, his head lifted onto a pillow to take the weight off his neck. His skin was pale and covered in sweat, and the rings around his eyes were dark and sunken. I could hear his labored breath was choked and raspy, and with each movement, he seemed to wince in pain. At the center of it all was the festering, multicolored tear on his throat, the source of his body's failings. The wound that his immune system had been fighting since Larry gave it to him had finally caught up, and at this point, there was no more we could do for him. Despite knowing this himself, Mark greeted me with a weak smile as I crossed over to him and slowly lowered onto my knees. I forced myself to return the gesture.

I could see him brace for pain as he spoke in a low gasp, "You know, of all the insane things that could have killed me while I was here, infection is probably the lamest way to go out."

I softly chuckled at the remark, half because of what he said, and half because he had put himself through the pain of speech to break the ice.

"I'm glad you laughed," He continued. "Bea didn't think it was as funny."

"Not even a sympathy laugh, huh?"

"Tough crowd." He joked.

A beat of silence passed as Mark swallowed. I could see his brow furrow as he decided how to ease into the next words. I couldn't imagine how hard it would be to know what to say when they would be your last. However, I was taken aback by what he chose.

"Do you dream, Joel?"

"Um, what do you mean?"

"Do you have dreams? Like when you sleep?"

I thought for a moment, "Yeah." I nodded. "I used to all the time. Mostly nightmares. But a lot of good dreams before that. I haven't had any in a while, though. Why?"

"It's the same with almost everyone else. Grace, Ben, Dan, Bea… Nobody except Jan and Ethan has dreams. I remember Andi mentioning that she had a few too, but as soon as we got here, everyone else said they stopped dreaming. Isn't that strange?"

I didn't necessarily understand his point, but clearly, this was important if he chose to tell me in his final goodbye. "Yeah," I replied. "That is weird."

"I had one last night, though. After three and a half years, I finally had a dream again, Joel."

"What was it about?"

"It was about Andi."

"Oh…"

"And green light."

I tilted my head, "Green light?"

Mark nodded. "I was sitting with Andi, and we were in the house, but it was different. There was furniture and decorations on the wall, and the clouds were gone outside. We were in the sunroom looking out the window at the horizon, and it was early morning, still, dim out. Andi smiled and told me we were waiting to see if the sun would come up, and as we waited, I got up to look around." Mark licked his lips then continued, "The house was so inviting. So cozy and comforting. I wished you could have seen it, Joel. It was beautiful, even the hills too. I went to look at the bedroom, and that's when I noticed a green glow coming from that door."

He pointed to the mysterious metal door at the back of the room, ever shut as always.

"It wasn't sinister, though. It was gentle and soft like a candle flame. I tried the knob, expecting it to be locked, but it actually turned, Joel. My heart was pounding, even in the dream, and from the other room, I heard Andi call out. She told me I could open it if I wanted, that there was plenty of time left. I didn't know what that meant, but I did it, and the light enveloped me…." Mark burst into a fit of coughs from so much talking and had to take a second to swallow them back down. "And then I woke up."

I stared at him blankly, unsure of what to say next. I was absolutely stunned.

"Mark, I… I don't…."

He began to softly chuckle, "I know. Crazy, right?"

I laughed with him, "I mean, that's certainly something." Once the laughter died down, I bit my cheek, "Why are you telling me all this?"

"I just thought it was nice to see Andi again. Even if it was just a dream. I thought you'd want to know that she was happy." Mark clearly meant his words, but there was a false demeanor behind what he said. There was clearly more to it. I could tell by his forlorn expression.

"Are you sure that's the only reason?"

He looked at me, caught off guard, then looked straight up at the ceiling. Whatever was weighing on him was weighing heavy. "There's always more to what's said, but it's not always important. I don't want to leave you on a negative note, Joel."

My heart began to slowly pick up its thump, "What do you mean? Is there something else? If it's bad, you can tell me, Mark. I can handle it."

Mark shook his head, "You've been through enough. Plus, things will be harder for everyone once I'm gone. I don't want to add more to that."

"I won't tell anyone then, I swear. Mark, please. If that dream was important, then I need to know why."

Mark attempted a sigh that was violently grated by his throat. "It's not necessarily about the dream; it's…." He paused before asking, "What's the worst thing you've ever done, Joel?"

The question hit me like a ton of bricks. My teeth immediately clenched together, and my hands began to shake. Of course, I knew the answer. I thought about it every day of my life. But why was Mark asking?

"W-What do you mean?" I laughed nervously. "That's a pretty heavy question."

Mark didn't laugh with me, however. His expression was stone and solemn. He turned to me and looked into my eyes, "Joel, it's okay. Do you want to know or not?"

My smile faded, and I shrank into myself, pondering for a moment. I had never told anyone. Not Ethan or Bea. Not even Andi. Mark and I were close, but I could never admit something so shameful to him. However, the man didn't have much time left, and I knew that if I told him, he probably wasn't intending to spread the word.

I swallowed, and the rotten words fell from my mouth in a slow rhythm, "I had a friend, once… A really good one. The kind you only find once in your lifetime; Always has your back, never gives up on you. Maybe that was his problem because I was just… Gosh, I was awful to him. He always gave so much to me, and all I did was keep taking. I got drunk a lot, and he would always be there watching me and making sure I didn't do anything stupid. There was one night though that he wasn't. I don't know where he was; maybe he left the party early or something. I don't know. At the time, I had just… Someone really close to me had left, and I was heartbroken about it. That's a whole other story, but the point is, I was all over the place. I didn't know what I wanted or what I was doing half the time. And my friend, he was dating this girl named Sarah, and for some reason, she was still at the party. She saw that I was alone and came over to talk, and I was lonely and liked the attention, so… I let her."

Mark said nothing. Just stared at me and slowly nodded along with my story.

"I'm sure you can guess what happened next. I um… we… yeah. She kissed me, and I kissed her back, and then… And I knew I shouldn't've, even drunk I knew, but I did it anyway. It felt nice to have someone close again. I wish it stopped there, but it didn't. I kept talking with her. We'd meet in secret. The whole time I knew how wrong it all was, but…." My eyes began to well up as the agony of my own regret ate me from inside, "It felt better to not be alone. I couldn't be alone, not after Rose. Isn't that messed up? It felt better to betray my best friend, who would have lay down his life for me, than it hurt just to be a little lonely. Isn't that so stupidly ironic?" I laughed darkly, tears falling freely now, "I wasn't alone. I had everything I needed, Everything I could ever want, and I just threw it away for cheap pleasure." I bit my cheek hard and tried to steady my breath, "So… Yeah… That's probably the worst thing I've ever done. At least one of them in a long list."

Mark sat silently, both for his own processing and for me to compose myself before speaking, "Thank you for sharing that, Joel. I'm sorry to make you talk about it."

I shook my head, "It's my own fault. Besides, it's good for me to finally admit it out loud to someone. Lay it out before me, you know? Really puts it all into perspective on how much I messed up."

Mark looked down to his feet then plainly said, "I was married before I got here."

"Really?"

He nodded, "Thirteen years with a woman who did nothing but treat me right. Went through everything together. Started a family together, gained and lost everything together. You go through all these things with a person you love, and you think to yourself that you could never be that kind of person, the kind to betray them like that. But somewhere along the way, you start to take them for granted. You get so used to them being in your life that you forget how lucky you are to have them. Then all of a sudden, something-- or someone-- new is there, and you… You just want to remember that special feeling. The only problem is you can't find that anywhere else, and by the time you realize it, it's too late."

I said nothing. Just stared down at my lap.

"It's not an excuse; there never is one. We live with the actions we commit. I've come to terms with that in the last few days. It only took me dying to realize it. Like you said, though, it's good to lay it all out."

More tears began to pool in my eyes, but I wiped them away, "Can you tell me what's wrong now?"

Mark looked at me with undeserved empathy and nodded. "I've asked everyone who's been in here the same question. If there's anything, they regret or feel guilty about."

I looked at him, confused, "Why?"

"I've been thinking a lot. About this place, about why we're here…. Joel, every single person here, everyone in this house, they've all done awful things. Frank, Claire, even Jan. They all told me that they've majorly messed up at some point in their lives. Ethan is the only one who didn't tell me anything, but he didn't have to. The signs are all there, Joel."

My heart beat slowly in my chest, "What are you saying, Mark?"

The broken man's eyes filled with tears as he swallowed down more pain then spoke, "We're here because we're bad people, Joel. This is our punishment for the things we've done. I think deep down we've all known it too; we just didn't want to accept it."

Dread welled up inside me, and my body shivered with stress. He was right in more ways than one. We had all known. We rarely talked about our pasts, but none of us were stupid. We picked up on the mannerisms, the subtle hints, and the clues. Our hands were dirty, and while none of us wanted to admit it, Mark was doing what truly scared us the most out of everything at the house. He was putting it all out into the open.

"I think you're right," I said, defeated. Then, after a short break, I added, "We aren't getting out of here, are we?"

I asked the question expecting that I already knew the answer, but mark surprised me with a warm smile, "No, Joel. That's why the dream is important. I thought that for a while. I thought pain and death was all that was in store for us, that Andi left for nothing, but after that dream last night… Joel, I know it sounds crazy, but I know it was real. At least it meant something real." He grabbed my hand tightly, "Don't give up, kid. I don't know what, but there's more to this place. There's hope. Stick together, build each other up, and wait for the moment you see that green light, then you run for it and don't slow down, okay?"

I did my best to hold back a sob and squeezed his hand back. "Okay, Mark. I promise."

We talked for a while longer, with Mark giving me an official goodbye that was full of tears on both ends. After that, everyone else rejoined the room. We all went to our spots and leaned up against the wall while Jan took a seat next to Mark and held his hand. Nobody said a word after that. We all just waited. Night fell, but nobody went to sleep. We knew if we did, we would most likely be a person less when we woke up. Ethan sat close next to me, and to my other side, Bea leaned her head on my shoulder. Time felt agonizingly long moment by moment, yet by the time the window across from me had turned from dark blue to black, and back to dark blue, it had all gone so fast. Much too fast… an hour later, we heard Mark take a struggled breath in that never came back out. Jan took a sharp inhale and held it as Benjamin slowly crept over to his body. He placed his fingers to his wrist and then turned back to the room.

We had all been doing our best to be strong for him in his last moments, but the second we saw Ben solemnly nod his head, we crumpled like paper in the rain.
