The Casanova’s are a very private family. They live up on a quiet hill in a big mansion outside of town. Nobody bothers them or even ever sees them. It wasn’t always like that though.

In the early 19th century the Casonova’s hosted a carnival—called it the freak-show after their main attraction. The entire town would gather and celebrate the yearly event without fail. That was until the year 1950.

Without warning 6 fires broke out roughly at the same time at different points on the property. By the time anyone noticed, the embers were too strong to deter or put out. The night sky was filled with smoke and screams before midnight.

When the flames finally died, the hill was silent. Entire families never came back down. Reports said the Casanova’s mansion stood untouched, towering above the blackened wreckage, its windows glowing faintly long after the smoke cleared. Others swore they saw shapes moving in the fire—figures too tall, too bent, too… wrong to be human.

In the weeks that followed, the town buried the bodies they could find. But for every coffin lowered into the ground, there were names with no remains to fill them. Dozens of people had vanished without a trace. The Casanova family offered no statement, no apology, no explanation. They locked the iron gates to their mansion and vanished from the public eye overnight.

From that year on, the carnival was never spoken of again. The hilltop mansion became a scar against the skyline, a reminder of what was lost—a reminder to the kids who grew up without a mom or dad. Parents warned their children never to wander too close. But sometimes, late at night, people claimed they could still hear faint carnival music drifting on the wind—pipes and drums warped, too slow and hollow to belong to any living band.

My grandmother never talked about what happened in 1950. She was there. She lost her parents that night. When she passed away, I found a tin box under her bed—inside were burned ticket stubs and a handbill for the Casanova Carnival. Under the handbill lay an old photo. It was my grandmother and her parents the night everything went wrong. 

Something about the photo unsettled me. The edges were scorched, but the faces were clear—my grandmother smiling nervously between her parents, the Casanova mansion looming overhead in the background. In the far corner though, blurred and half-lost in the bad quality of the photo, was a shape that didn’t belong. I told myself it was just a trick of the camera, but the longer I stared, the harder it became to believe that.

That’s when I started digging. That’s when I learned the story I’m about to tell you.

I drove out to the old Casanova property a week after finding the box. The iron gates were still there, rusted and sagging, padlocked shut. A handmade sign bolted to the bars read NO TRESPASSING. The kind of warning that makes you want to look closer.

The path up the hill was overgrown, but you could still see where the carnival grounds had once been. I found stone footings where booths might have stood, broken bottles, the skeleton of a Ferris wheel buried in weeds. Every step felt heavier, like the land itself wanted me gone.

I told myself I’d only stay a few minutes, take a couple of pictures, and leave. But then I heard it. Faint, so faint I thought it was the wind at first: the slow, wheezing notes of a calliope.

I followed the sound until the trees broke, and that’s when I saw it. Something stood between the burned-out remains of two carnival tents. At first I thought it was a man, swaying back and forth. But then it stepped into the moonlight, and I realized its arms were too long. Too many joints. Its head jerked unnaturally with each movement, like a puppet with tangled strings.

It looked at me. And I swear to God—it smiled.

For a moment, neither of us moved. My throat closed up, my body locked in place as though it were waiting for me to make the first mistake. Then it tilted its head all the way to the side until I heard a crack, and with a sudden snap it lunged forward.

The thing didn’t run like a person. Its limbs bent the wrong way, driving it forward in a series of sharp, bounding strides, like a rabbit sprinting from a predator—or a predator chasing prey. Dirt scattered behind it as its arms hit the ground and its fingers dug into the ground to push itself with more force—carrying it toward me on all fours with impossible speed.

I stumbled back through the weeds, nearly tripping over a rusted beam. The music swelled, faint but distinct, like it was playing in time with my heartbeat. I could see its face clearer now—its grin stretched too wide, its eyes hollow and wet, like glass marbles shoved into a skull.
I ran. I didn’t look back until I hit the gates. By then the calliope had gone silent, and the clearing behind me was empty, as if nothing had ever been there at all.

But I know what I saw. And if I’m right, the freak show isn’t just history. It’s still here.

I’m writing this to ask for your help. I don’t know what to do or how to handle this. Whatever happened that night in 1950 wasn’t a coincidence—it wasn’t just fire and panic. If anyone reading this knows what the Casanova family was involved in, or anything that can help, please—tell me. Because I’m afraid this isn’t over.
