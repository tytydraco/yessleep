I promised myself I wouldn’t write this down. Some things should stay buried, and maybe I should have stayed buried too. But my head won’t stop replaying it, like a scratched record looping on the same awful sound.

It started at the school prom. Everyone else remembers the music, the lights, the glitter in the air. I remember her. The way her dress shimmered under the spotlights, the way she moved like the room existed only for her, my classmate. I’d been waiting for this night for years, rehearsing in the mirror, whispering the words to myself so many times I could have said them backwards.

When I finally stepped up, my throat locked, my body shaking. But I did it. I told her what I’d been holding in since the first time I saw her. I confessed.

She looked at me. And then she laughed.

Not a nervous laugh. Not even a kind laugh. A sharp, cruel sound that cut through me deeper than any blade. 

Something snapped in me then. The music became muffled, the lights too bright, the air too thin. I don’t remember deciding. I just remember my hand on her wrist, the shock in her eyes, and the way I smiled at everyone else so they wouldn’t look too closely.

Nobody noticed us leave. Nobody cared enough to.

By the time she realized we were heading toward the parking lot, it was too late.

The ride back was the longest silence I’ve ever lived through. The radio was on, but I couldn’t tell you what song played. It all sounded like static. She kept her eyes on the window, like if she stared hard enough the glass would melt and let her escape.

I remember my hands on the wheel, white-knuckled, sweating. Every turn of the road felt like a point of no return. I told myself I wasn’t really doing this, that any second I’d stop, apologize, let her out. But the words never came. The engine hummed and the tires kept moving forward, like something else was driving for me.

When we pulled up to my house, the porch light flickered three times. It does that sometimes when the bulb is about to die. She looked at it the way drowning people look at the surface.

I led her inside. She didn’t fight, not really. She just went quiet, like she’d folded herself into a smaller shape, waiting for this to be over. But I knew it wouldn’t be over. Not yet.

The door to the basement groaned when I opened it. That sound has lived in my bones ever since. The air down there smelled of rust and dust, heavy and sour.

I told her to go down first. She hesitated, just for a breath, and then she did. Step after step into the dark. I followed, and with each creak of the stairs, the world above us felt further away.

When the door closed behind us, it was like the night outside never existed.

I raped, choked and left her body there. 2 months passed. I'm hanging myself up in 2 hours, I'll eat first.

If I disappear tonight, will anyone finally care enough to come looking for her… or for me?
