Another day, another morning waking to the sight of a water spot slowly browning on the ceiling above my hospital bed. I've been here a week, and I still don't know who I am. No one has come to claim me, and no one seems to recognize me. A few days ago, I asked the doctors and nurses to give me a temporary name—anything to replace "the patient" and "miss." They settled on Alex Doe. Better than Jane, I guess.

I begin each day by scribbling my thoughts into a journal, hoping that someday soon I’ll be able to pull a memory from all the fog. This morning as I began to write, I was interrupted by a soft knock on the door. A nurse I like, Mandy, was there to check on me.

"How are you feeling today, Alex?" she asked. Her smile was warm and reassuring as always.

I shrugged, staring at the blank pages of my journal. "Same as yesterday, I suppose."

Mandy patted my hand gently and went on to check my vitals. "You’re getting better every day. Don't worry; sometimes it just takes time for memories to come back. We'll figure it out. Detective Morris is here to see you. Are you feeling up to chatting with him?"

Detective Morris has arrived at my bedside every day since I woke up. He seems kind and he’s very careful with me, like I’m a glass ornament he doesn’t want to break. I nodded to Mandy and said “sure, that’s fine.”

Mandy called to the doorway. “Come in, Detective. I’ll leave you two to talk. But please—Alex is tired. Don’t stay too long.” 

Detective Morris gave Mandy a polite nod as he walked in, passing her in the doorway. "She… doesn’t like me very much does she?”  

I laughed, “doesn’t seem like it, no.”

“Ok, well—I swear I’ll keep it short but I do need to talk to you, Alex. First off, I’m sorry but we don’t have any news for you yet.  How are you feeling today? Are you ok, all things considered?”

“I’m ok, I guess.” – what else could I say?  

“Do you remember anything yet, Alex? Even images that flash into your mind or dreams you’ve had might help us find out who you are and what happened. Anything?" 

I shook my head. "Nothing."

The detective's gaze lingered on me for a moment before he continued, "Listen, we’ve been keeping something from you because you were in a very fragile state when you were first admitted, but I think it’s time to let you know in case it helps you remember something. There’s no easy way to say this. Have you heard of the Lipstick Killer? He’s been in the headlines for years now but never caught.”

“I… I think so? Maybe?” I said, feeling a growing sense of unease. The phrase “Lipstick Killer” knocked around in my mind. Aside from being scary, I knew it was familiar, but I couldn’t quite grasp the memory.  

Detective Morris continued: “He’s a suspected serial killer. I know the name sounds ridiculous, but it’s what the news channels came up with. I’ll spare you the details, but each of his victims has been found with a cheek-to-cheek smile drawn on her face. You match the description of his other victims—brunette, tall, blue eyes, athletic build. We found you and a man unconscious in a fire at an abandoned house, remember? You had head trauma, which explains your memory loss. He hasn’t woken up yet—he’s not doing well—but he had his ID on him. Does the name Greg Palmer mean anything to you?"

I blinked, the name Greg Palmer triggering something deep within my foggy mind. "I—I’m not sure. Who is Greg Palmer?"

Detective Morris: "He’s someone whose sister was the Lipstick Killer’s first victim about five years ago. We had no reason to suspect him at the time, but we… well, there’s no easy way to say this. We think that he tried to hurt you. And we think that he might be the Lipstick Killer. We don’t yet know for sure because the killer has never left a surviving victim, and I shouldn’t be telling you this. But between us, Alex, there’s just too much here to be coincidence." 

My heart raced as the detective's words sank in. Greg Palmer, a man whose name somehow echoed in my fragmented mind, apparently tried to kill me and was the prime suspect in a series of gruesome murders including his own sister’s. And I, Alex only-because-I-can’t-remember-my-own-name Doe, am the only survivor. Not being able to remember who this man is or what happened to me makes me want to scream. I felt determination wash over me.

 “I want to see him.”

“No way,” Detective Morris said. “I shouldn’t have even told you this. It goes against every rule in the book. I just—I feel like you’re so close, Alex. So close to remembering. I can show you a photo; would that help?”

“No, I need to see him in the flesh. I have to, detective.”

“I’m sorry Alex. My hands are tied.”

Over the next week, Detective Morris continued his daily visits and I persisted in my request to see Greg Palmer in his hospital bed. The detective finally relented. "Ok, Alex. You can see him. I pulled some strings, and it will be safe anyway because he hasn’t woken up. They think he has about a 50/50 shot at this point. But don't worry. I will be there, and so will the officer guarding him. Are you sure about this, Alex?"

“Yes, I’m sure. Take me to him.”

“All right, I’ll ask the nurse to get you into a wheelchair and we'll bring you down to his room. Know that we can turn back at any time. You don’t have to see him.”

“I’ll be fine, Detective.” I was determined. I needed my memories to come back, and it was possible that seeing Greg would help me.

When we entered the dimly lit room where Greg lay in a coma, a flood of memories rushed back. I started to gasp. My head was spinning, I couldn’t think straight. I couldn’t breathe! 

Detective Morris: “Alex, are you ok?”

Mandy stepped between us: “That’s enough, detective! We have to get this patient back to her room right away and have the doctor see her. This was too much too soon. She’s still in a very weakened condition. We never should have allowed this!”

Everything went black.

I woke up in my hospital bed with a doctor standing over me. 

Doctor: “Alex, I’m Dr. Ramos. You fainted but your vitals seem fine now. Are you feeling ok?”

“I think so. I just felt very woozy, but I’m ok now. Really.” I wanted to get the doctor out of my room so that I could be alone to think.

Doctor: “All right, well you seem ok. Your nurse will be in to check on you later, but just hit the call button should you need anything.”

Once the doctor left, my mind raced with images of my past. I remembered my mother. I could have been her twin. I remember her never allowing my stepdad to see her in the morning until she had applied a full face of makeup including a perfect pout of blood red lipstick. “You have to be beautiful for your man, dear. That’s something I’ve learned with your stepfather. Stay beautiful and the man in your life will never look at anyone else.”  

I remember my mother ignoring my cries for help when I was twelve and my stepfather began hurting me. I remember her smiling ghoulishly at me with those same red lips. 

Mother: “You must be confused, dear. You can’t go around saying such disgusting lies.”

I remembered how badly I hurt inside and how she mashed her lipstick to my face, drawing an awful, clownish grin. She kept telling me to “just smile” whenever I would try to tell her about my stepfather. “Just smile” whenever we would go out or whenever someone would come to visit. “Just smile” whenever the pain became too much to bear. 

Mother: “Don’t be so dramatic! Just smile, dear. Just… smile!” And so, eventually, I would wear her lipstick and practice the most genuine seeming smiles I could muster. The girl who stared back at me in the mirror even looked happy—except for in her eyes. Still, I forced myself to smile.

My mind turned to thoughts of Greg Palmer, his face twisted with anguish and anger as he confronted me after years of searching for his sister's killer. He found me while I was out for a jog of all things. I ducked into an old, abandoned house I had often seen during my runs in the woods. It was overgrown and falling apart, but it was big and seemed like my best bet. 

Greg chased me in but I lost him pretty quickly. I was hiding in an eaves closet in a second-floor bedroom behind some old boxes. Greg yelled out to me:

“Get out here! I KNOW WHO YOU ARE! You know what? Forget it. I’ll get you out. I prepared for this. I’ve got a lighter and some lighter fluid. READY TO COME OUT NOW?”

I didn’t respond.

Greg: “No? Really?! Ok! I warned you.”

I didn’t believe that Greg would do it, but it wasn’t long before I heard the cracks and pops of a roaring fire. The old wood caught easily and it wasn’t long before the house was bursting into a blaze. I tried to get out from where I was hiding, but I saw Greg there at the top of the stairs.

Greg: “It’s been five years. Five years since I lost my sweet sister Dana. You took her from me and you’re not going to get out of here alive!”

Narrator: “I don’t know what you mean! Why are you chasing me?! I’ll call the police!”

Greg: “Oh cut the crap. I’ve been watching you. I saw you the night my sister’s body was found. You were with the search crew but where everyone else was upset you were grinning! You had this horrible red lipstick on your face, and you were just there, smiling! I made my way through the crowd to talk to you but by the time I could get past the swarm, you were gone. Then when the next killing happened, I joined the search that time and I saw you again. Nobody believed me BUT I SAW YOU.”

Before long, more of the house was engulfed in flames. Both Greg and I were coughing. It was getting hard to breathe. 

Narrator: “You’re crazy! It wasn’t me! We need to get out of here!”

Greg: “Shut up!” 

Greg pulled a tube of lipstick out of his pocket. “You see this? This was my sister’s! I always told myself that when I found her killer, I’d get my revenge and do to them what they did to her! And that’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to choke the life out of you and I am going to draw a big smile on your face for all the god damned world to see!”

He jammed the lipstick back into his pocket and pulled out a knife as he moved toward me. I wanted to scream for help! But, before I could say anything else the floor began to give way beneath us. 

And that’s all I remember from before waking in the hospital.

***

That tube of lipstick was all too familiar. it was my mother's old brand, the very one she had used. The one I had used since I was twelve. And the memories it conjured were far from innocent.

As I stared at the lipstick, trembling with dread and revelation, I recalled meeting Dana Palmer our freshman year of college. How we became fast friends. And how one night, she had blacked out at a party and the worst things had happened to her. She confessed this to me one night as we walked in the woods near our dorm. She was understandably upset, but I consoled her and gave her a tube of my lipstick. I always kept some on hand. I told her that I knew it was hard, but that she could still have a pretty smile. Dana became angry with me and we fought. She yelled and screamed, and she pulled my hair, but in the end she was smiling. It was such a pretty smile.

I wanted all the sad girls to have pretty smiles. Pretty smiles for a beautiful world. I had selected the perfect shade for each of them. And when I strangled those girls, I knew those smiles would be there forever even as the light left their eyes. The words of my mother echoed in my mind, her voice dripping with sweet malice: "Just smile, dear. Just... smile."

The more I remembered, the more the dread slipped away. The smile I had worn for years, the one I had been forced to perfect as a child, was now etched onto my own face. 

In a moment of clarity, I forced myself to look solemn again and maintain my composure. A nurse could come into my room at any time, and I needed to hide the truth that had clawed its way back into my consciousness. I wanted them to keep believing that Greg was the Lipstick Killer. I needed them to. The story was perfect that way. He basically giftwrapped himself for me, carrying lipstick and a knife into the house.

As the days passed, I bided my time, pretending to still be weak and disoriented since fainting. I couldn't let anyone suspect my true intentions or that I remembered who I was. Each night, I waited for the perfect moment to strike. After the last nurse came to check on me and the hospital quieted down, I snuck out to watch the guard outside of Greg's room as he fought to stay awake.

Finally, the perfect night presented itself. The guard was snoring, blissfully unaware, and the halls were empty. I grabbed the pillow from my bed and crept toward Greg’s room. I remembered his pain as he confronted me. That delicious pain. Almost as delicious as the pain his sister felt when I wrapped my hands around her throat to stop her screaming. I felt electric with adrenaline. The guard was deep asleep but he could wake at any second, and I knew this was my only chance.

I couldn’t hesitate. I lifted the pillow. Greg Palmer would forever be remembered as the Lipstick Killer. And in the morning when Detective Morris comes to tell me the news, I’ll just… smile.
