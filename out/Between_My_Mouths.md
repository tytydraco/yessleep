I don't remember when I started liking to stay on the edge.

Perhaps it was the first time I plunged my feet into water that was too hot and felt the heat throbbing up my ankles. Or when I left my hand still on the iron, just turned off, just long enough to hear that silent sizzle the skin makes before the pain. It wasn't masochism, I think. It was something else. A kind of trembling that left me suspended, as if my body were breathing on its own without needing me.

Sometimes I tangle my legs until they cease to exist. I wait as long as it takes to stop feeling any temperature or texture. When that moment arrives, I move them again. Then the current begins to flow, the tingling runs through my entire body, like an echo awakening beneath the skin. The pathways in my legs ache, burn, make me wrinkle my face, my muscles tense, and I try to move slowly just to maximize the sensation.

I've tried other things. Dropping something onto my toes, until the impact elicits a small internal scream and my body convulses for a second. Holding my breath until my chest burns, my face heats up, the veins in my temples bulge, and my heart pounds in the wrong place, right between my legs. But it's not about reaching the point, or finishing, or anything like that. If I ever cross the line, if I give in to the impulse, everything shuts down. So I stop. Always before. Always in time. There, in the anteroom, everything is alive: the air, the skin, the moisture, the stinging, the burning.

Lately, it's been harder. My body doesn't respond the same way anymore. My legs take longer to go numb, the burning dissipates quickly, as if my skin has learned to defend itself against me. I've started looking for new ways to return. Sometimes I plunge my hands into ice water, so cold it feels like it burns, my fingers turning a beautiful cherry red. My skin cracks and my nails turn dark, pale violet, almost like the thickest blood imaginable.

But it doesn't last long. My body forgets with an ease that frightens me, drives me to despair. Each attempt leaves me a little further away, a little hollower. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and don't feel the sheets against my skin. I must clench my fists, bite my lower lip until it bleeds, which no longer tastes like rusty metal, nor has any warmth. I must scratch the mattress and break my nails, just to check that I'm still there.

For weeks now, my body has behaved like something borrowed. I walk, I breathe, I move, but it's as if I'm doing it inside a suit that never quite fits. My skin no longer registers what it touches: water, air, fabric. Everything has the same soft temperature as things that don't quite exist.

I try to return to moisture, to that small pulse that once kept me alive, but the current doesn't arrive. Neither the tingling, nor the pulse, nor the pressure that reminded me I was there. I've tried to trick my body with contrasts, with abrupt changes, with thermal shock, with the silence of a room that's too dark. Nothing.

A week ago, I had half a liter of cooking oil for breakfast. The texture of water seemed uncertain, weak, lifeless. I drank directly from the bottle. It was thicker and slippery. It was the oil I had used the day before to fry a portion of potatoes. I opened my mouth and let the oil drip directly from my mouth onto my hands. I could see the small black specks scattered throughout the liquid. It felt different. I brought the oil back to my mouth and let it wander between my teeth. I moved my tongue through the substance. It felt like someone trying to run in a swimming pool. I swallowed the oil slowly. Just then, I felt the oil reach between my legs.

I was expelling it from my mouth between my legs. I quickly wiped my right hand and brought it between my legs. There it was, I smiled. The moisture. My blessed moisture had returned. I smiled ecstatically, my teeth greasy and my tongue numb. I took the bottle of oil and took a couple more sips, following that little ritual I had just learned. At that same moment, like a synchronized dance, a tender, clear, and warm sea flowed from my mouth between my legs, enough to warm me on its journey down to my ankles. It was me. It was my scent of damp skin. It was my cry to be able to feel. My fingertips tingled, eager to taste me, to detect his temperature, to smell me more closely. It was delicious. Almost translucent. Because I wouldn't let myself be, because I needed the control only I can give my body. Because I needed the rules, I forced myself to follow. I needed that wetness, that pulse, that lack of control. I needed to drag him along, chain him, and laugh in his face. I needed my legs to tremble and for him to beg me for a little bit of me.

That would have been all.

 

If it had worked endlessly.

I repeated this little moment three or four more times that week. However, one morning it all stopped again. I no longer tasted the ash I'd known before. It didn't feel special, bitter, or slimy. Nothing. The way it lingered between my teeth didn't work; my tongue didn't float in its density and swallowing it felt pointless.

I looked at the stove and then at the refrigerator. The temperature had worked before. But a spoonful of burnt oil? What could I possibly taste with that added element? The moisture of my frozen tongue against the surface and the resulting wound of my taste buds being ripped from my flesh. I knew that pain well: the rusty taste of my frozen blood, the throbbing of my skinned tongue, and the sight of my flesh glued to that cold surface. I needed something else.

I looked back at the stove. The heat could be adjusted, and perhaps... a spoonful of reused oil at the right temperature could ignite my body again. I closed my eyes and shook my head nervously. But what I was, wasn't a human, a woman. I was an impulse, and I lived for it. I took the small frying pan, poured in a drizzle of oil, and lit the stove. I turned the knob and made sure it was on the lowest setting. No more than a few seconds passed before I held the palm of my hand over it. It felt warm. Good enough.

I poured the spoonful of oil, brought it to my face, and the smell of oil filled my nostrils and head. A new anticipation filled my body. I touched the oil with my upper lip… there was a change. I put the spoon in my mouth and let the oil fall onto my tongue. I squealed for a split second, but the sensation of burning coals was gone as quickly as it came. My mouth was too hot for the temperature I had brought the oil to. I needed a little more.

I turned the knob and watched as the flames grew a little larger. I counted to 60 and removed the pan from the heat before pouring it onto the spoon. I dipped my pinky finger into the oil, just the tip and a bit of my nail. I felt a sting that made my pupils dilate. I knew because the filter in my eyes changed. Everything looked more… ochre, more cinnamon-colored. I was getting there. I pulled the tip out and brought it to my mouth. The substance felt much warmer. With a little more heat, I would reach my goal.

Once again, with a little more oil, I put the pan on the stove. Higher heat and 60 seconds. After 45 seconds, I could see tiny bubbles on the edge of the pan. I smiled through my gums. I quickly poured the oil into a glass and held it to my face. It now had a sweet, petroleum scent, like mascara left in the sun. I couldn't wipe the smile off my face, and even my wisdom teeth were going numb. I took a deep breath and poured the oil into my mouth, right onto my tongue. The shudder was immediate. My body jerked, and tears began to roll down my cheeks. I swirled the oil between my teeth and felt the space between them growing larger. Like a dam that couldn't hold back the water completely. A leak.

My tongue felt heavy and floated in the hot oil, burning, growing. Then, I began to feel my mouth filled up, as if the oil had doubled in size. It was dribbling from the corner of my lips, and I decided to swallow it. With all the calm it deserved. The thick liquid began to travel down my windpipe; my legs were trembling, as were my hands. My chest burned, and I felt as if my ribcage was dissolving.

My face felt hot, my neck hot, my eyes hot. Now I had a reddish filter over my eyes, like a color film on a cheap nightclub night. I swallowed a good portion and my body convulsed as the moisture from the mouth between my legs appeared. It let itself be, it spilled from my body. The mouth between my legs couldn't contain itself and I could see the hot oil and saliva from the mouth that lived between my legs rolled downstream until it disappeared into my slippers.

I remained mesmerized, absorbed in those paths that formed. My legs burned, they smelled of sex and tar. The color began to change to a vibrant red and then, to a wine red. I frowned and brought my trembling hands to the mouth between my legs, took some of that mixture of substances and brought my fingers to my other mouth. It tasted of old oil, ovulation, and blood. The oil had carved its path like a river current through the earth. I savored the taste between my teeth, and then I knew. The circle was complete; what had entered my mouth had left and entered again.

I couldn't help but smile even wider; fullness coursed through my veins and gnawed at my mind.

However, I felt a slight numbness. Something acidic, something that burned more than boiling oil. It was nausea. Unable to control my body, I fell to my knees on the icy ground. My spine arched, and I felt as if my vertebrae were about to dislocate. It was something coming from my intestines, or my stomach, or the veins in my calves—I'm not sure. I didn't want to expel it, but I wasn't in control of my body, and I hated it.

Waves and waves of bloody vomit poured from my mouth. It wasn't just liquid. I could see red clots, red bits of something. The walls of my mouth and the long tube of my trachea felt like they were boiling. The red vomit filled my hands, my chin, the thin skin of my neck, and my breasts. It felt so… intoxicating. A burning, almost corrosive sensation from the inside out. It was peeling my skin off my organs. But it felt so, so warm against my skin. It was hallucinatory and pleasurable. So much so that the mouth between my legs filled again with oily, still-warm blood.

I felt utterly absurd.

And so gratified

This was what I had been searching for my entire life.

However, I didn't know if I had enough skin left on my organs for next time.
