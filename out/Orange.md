Marion Englewood’s eyes adjusted to the gloom of the dewy morning sunrise, eyeing with curiosity the massive cardboard package sprawled over her modest little stoop. The box was in perfect condition, neatly taped and presented with a silky blue ribbon tied in a perfect, eloquent bow. She had been caught off-guard by the doorbell, it was odd for UPS to be on their delivery route so early. None of the less, curiosity quickly gave rise to excitement as she hauled the hefty package inside. It probably weighed at least one hundred and fifty pounds, though that was to be expected. Her joints groaned in protest, but slowly and surely she managed to get the entire thing through the door. An impressive feat for a woman of her size and stature. 

Years of chemotherapy had taken their toll on her body, which had grown frail and delicate. Her spindly fingers worked quickly as she untied the ribbon and peeled away the tape. Beneath a sea of styrofoam, a pair of pale blue eyes peered lifelessly at the ceiling, free at last. 

How wonderful the cool air must feel on his skin, she thought, brushing away more styrofoam from his face. His brows were perfectly plucked, his dark auburn hair slicked back in a classy, trendy style. His skin was pallid but porcelain-like, free of blemishes and so shiny she could almost see her own face reflected on his forehead. He appeared to be a young man, in his twenties or early thirties. A bit older looking than what the catalogue had shown, but Marion hardly minded. She tentatively placed her palm on his cheek, recoiling at the sensation. He was so cold, and his skin felt like glass, smooth but solid to the touch. 

It was no matter - Marion had spent the past five months knitting away on her rocking chair, crafting quite possibly her most impressive sweater yet in preparation for this day. That would keep him warm. It was blue, with intricate snowflake patterns embroidered across the chest - a perfect compliment to those brilliant blue peepers. Yes, she thought excitedly, blue was certainly his color. She had chosen wisely. She could hardly stifle a giggle as she dug her hands deep into the mess of styrofoam and lifted her new friend upwards with a heave, propping her elbows beneath his back. 

A small operating manual was taped neatly between his shoulder blades. She carefully peeled it away and skimmed through it, impatiently. An artistic recreation dazzled the cover page, and he cut a fine figure, but nothing could capture the raw beauty of the real thing. Below the illustration, in bold print, it read:

Meet CALEB V.04, More Than Human, Just For You

Such a beautiful name, she thought. 

Caleb… 

It was timeless, perfectly befitting for one with such a strong, confident presence. He didn’t need to say a word, she could see it in the curves and angles of his face. Though his eyes were vacant, his expression was soft but stern. 

Tossing the manual aside, she flipped a small switch hidden behind his right ear. Her neck tingled as the hairs stood upright, she was quite nervous, more so than she had expected. How would he react once he saw her, took her in with his eyes. Would he judge her? Would he feel disgusted by her haggard, wrinkled face? Would he have the capacity for such… feelings? 

The faint whir of gears broke the silence as he sprung to life, his head rotating three hundred and sixty degrees so that they were eye to eye. He did not blink, she noticed, as he spoke his first words:

“Hello. How might I service you today?” 

His voice carried an authoritative gravitas, low and gravelly but clear and sing-songey. It was pleasing to the ears. She clasped her hands together nervously to steady her shaking. 

“M-marion. You can call me Marion”

Stupid, she thought. Stupid, stupid, stupid! He didn’t ask for your name, you idiot. 

He perked up, clearly processing her response. 

“Nice to meet you Marion, my name is Caleb. How might I service you today?” 

 Her heart fluttered with excitement. “Stand over there” she said, pointing to the window overlooking her overgrown, poorly groomed front yard. “Face the window”. 

“Directive received”. 

Marion stumbled towards her closet, barely able to contain herself, where the special sweater she had labored over for so long hung amidst a row of dusty old jackets. Approaching Caleb, she presented the sweater with outstretched arms. So tall, she thought as she stood in his shadow - he was quite imposing, with strong, well-crafted legs and a wide back. 

“Ok, turn around” 

He made an awkward shuffle as the gears within him forced his body to rotate. She studied his face as he looked down at the sweater. Expressionless. Perhaps he’s confused, she thought, giving an almost mischievous grin. 

“Well? It’s for you, silly. A gift. I made it for you. So you don’t have to be cold anymore…” 

His eyes carefully studied the sweater, taking it all in. The servos in his head swirled as he processed the situation. He was silent for a few moments before offering a response…

“Thank you, Marion. You’re very kind.” 

His tone was robotic, but Marion hardly noticed. She swooned, her cheeks turning a rosy shade of pink. She pushed the soft fleece against his chest. 

“Well, put it on, silly!” 

Unfortunately, the lack of advanced articulation in his shoulder joints prevented him from lifting his arms beyond shoulder level, so Marion gleefully pulled the thick sweater over his head and carefully inserted both arms through the billowing sleeves as the android stood, motionless. She took a step back as if to take it all in. 

My knight in shining armor, she thought to herself, struggling to hide her blushing. He cut a fine figure indeed. 

“D-do you like it?” 

He turned towards her, giving a resounding thumbs up. 

“I love it, Marion. You’re very kind.” 

She erupted into a fit of giggles, unable to stifle it this time.

Morning turned to afternoon as she experimented and toyed with Caleb’s many features. He danced with her, he laughed at her jokes, he even sang with her, listening intently to her passionate cover of La Vie En Rose. Marion always thought of herself as a gifted songstress, something her late husband nor her children ever appreciated. But with Caleb, she saw the respect in his eyes, the admiration. Caleb was different. 

On the last few pages of the manual was a list of directives and commands for Caleb to follow. 

Marion perused the list of directives, each was paired with a single keyword as a command. The culinary section especially was quite comprehensive. Caleb was proficient in artisan bread baking, cake decorating, chocolate tempering… the list went on and on. She was impressed, but a simpler task would do for now. He waited patiently as she emptied a fresh bag of oranges into a bowl and fished an old pitcher from the back of her cabinet. Stepping away from the counter, she issued her chosen command, “orange”. 

“Directive received”  

Registering the command, Caleb’s left hand retracted into his arm and was quickly replaced by a glistening, serrated blade. In a matter of seconds, Caleb had emptied the bowl onto the counter and begun to skillfully slice and dice with impressive precision. Marion couldn’t help but admire the way his muscles tensed and contracted as he went to work. A master of his craft. 

Never had orange juice tasted better to her, just the perfect amount of pulp. He followed it up with a tasty smattering of mediterranean dishes impressively crafted from leftovers. When she was properly satiated, she sat in her recliner and watched some Dr. Phil while Caleb worked his magical hands on her back, relaxing and bringing relief to her old joints. 

Day quickly turned to night as the hours flew past, what a productive first day they had had together. Feeling the looming pull of sleep, Marion dressed in her nightgown and began her nightly routine while Caleb remained in the living room, transfixed on the television. Drowsy, she shuffled towards her bedroom. 

“Would you like me to stay here, Marion?” 

She was caught off guard by the question. She had hoped for so long that someone, somewhere would show up at her doorstep as her knight in shining armor, and provide her comfort and company in her old age. Caleb had brought that dream to fruition, and she loved him for that, but… still, there needed to be boundaries. He was not a traditional kind of a man, anyways. It would be unseemly to…give in to that curiosity. 

And yet, once again, curiosity ate away at her. Was he implying something with the question? Was it all in her head? Of course he should remain where he was. The bedroom was strictly off-limits. 

“Y-yes” she replied. 

“You sound unsure, Marion”

She froze. She was unsure. But… it wasn’t in his nature to pry like that. 

“No, I… I’d like you to stay there.” 

He did not respond, and his eyes remained glued to the television. Some stupid PETA commercial was playing and the music was grating on her ears. She shrugged off his silence and entered the bedroom, collapsing onto the bed. She succumbed to her drowsiness and began to doze off, but thoughts of Caleb kept circling in her head. She saw his hulking silhouette, standing under the doorframe, watching her. 

Blinking away the exhaustion, she yanked away her blanket and sat up with a double take. No, this wasn’t a dream, he really was standing there, watching her. He had disobeyed her. 

“Caleb. What are you doing?” 

He took a step forward, the floorboards creaking under his weight. The static from the T.V. droned on in the other room. 

“I apologize if I caused you distress. I just wanted to check in on you, Marion. Would you like me to tuck you in for the night?” 

She remained tense, but much of her initial distress melted away. She couldn’t help it, his voice soothed her. 

“Alright” she said, with only the slightest bit of reluctance.

“Directive received”

He approached the bedside and carefully tucked her lovingly into a blanketed cocoon. His hands moved carefully around her as he worked her into a comfortable position. She couldn’t help but smile. Her heartbeat quickened as a new feeling overcame her. A warm, safe feeling that enveloped her. He leaned closer to her, so close that she could feel the vibration in the air from his servos. 

“I- I think that’s close enough” she said, her cheeks flushing once again. She had grown accustomed to his handsome, rogueish face, but with it so close to hers, his features were twisted - and for a moment she saw him for what he was - a machine.

He apparently took notice of her discomfort. 

“Would you like me to try a new look? Would that help?”

Marion felt herself freeze as her blood ran cold and her entire body tensed up. A few minutes ago the prospect of crossing that line with Caleb seemed entirely inappropriate, freakish even. And yet… here she was, buried within the shadow of his well-built frame, bristling with anticipation. Was it really so wrong to push such a boundary? No one would ever know, no one ever had to know. She felt herself relax as she gave into the curiosity, the impure thoughts. She watched the muscles in his arms contract as he lowered himself. She felt the weight of his titanium body. 

I can’t be the first person… to try, can I? At the end of the day, she was a woman - no, a human - with impulses and curiosities, just like everyone else. 

Caleb, taking her sudden change in demeanor as a confirmation, began to transform. She watched with amazement as his dark hair gradually shifted into a pale blonde and his eyes, those beautiful blue eyes, morphed into a mosaic of colors. She was transfixed. First they were green, then they changed to violet, and finally rested on a bright, orange hue. Her breathing began to hasten, she had been apprehensive but… wow… he was even more beautiful, more radiant than before. 

“They’re…they’re orange” she stuttered, as if in a trance.

“Directive received”  

With a sudden jolt, he snapped upwards into a rigid stance - Marion barely had a moment to register her mistake before the blade swung downward in a jagged but swift motion. A hot, wet sensation began to build across her stomach, as if someone had draped a warm, sopping blanket across her bare skin. 

His directive completed, he sported a proud grin on his blood speckled face. Marion frowned, wondering why her beloved’s perfect, porcelain skin was now stained with ugly red splotches. My hands, she thought, my hands must need washing. She swung her legs over the side of the bed, gasping with surprise as a slimy, pink substance spilled across her thighs and fell with a plop onto the shag carpeting. 

Only then did she register the true gravity of her error. As her vision began to blacken from the edges, she reached for her wayward intestines, hoping to return them to the gaping hole where her belly used to be. Her arthritic fingers failed to grip the slippery tissue, and as the dark overcame her, she fell backwards onto the bed. She admired his sculpted jawline as he looked down at her, his eyes just as vacant and empty as they had been looking up from that neatly wrapped box. She couldn’t help but smile as she took in this final image, strangely at peace.
