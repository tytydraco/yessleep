**Before you make any judgements. I just want to clarify that I'm not some braindead kid on the internet who did it for some tiktok challenge. I am not diagnosed with any sort of illness that would make me act the way I did. I do not do illicit and illegal substances.** 

I would describe myself as a simple person. I live an ordinary life, working the day off at as a clerk at a grocery store, and then driving home to my wife and two daughters. I usually avoid stopping anywhere on the way since money is tight right now.

It is important that I tell you more about my wife. She is a mild mannered, soft spoken women. She is the least confrontation person I know, but she is not afraid to stand up for herself. Sarah and I have been together for about 12 years now, and she works as a waitress in a decent restaraunt in our town.

Even though it's nearly holiday season, my kids, Jeanie, 7, and Paula, 9, aren't excited for Christmas since some douchebag pastor told them that Santa isn't real at a mall last year. Now, even though I hate that they won't get to experience the magic of Christmas, I still try to get them presents to give them something to look forward to. It's just been so hard to connect with them lately. Sometimes they say things I cannot understand, despite how many times I try. I know that Paula is really into that Among Us game, so I'll probably get her a plushie and I'll get Jeanie the same thing in a different color since I don't know what she's into. I probably should ask her, but I've been so busy that I keep forgetting.

Anyway, on the day of the incident, my wife kissed me goodbye. She wanted me to ask for Christmas off, but I had no intention of doing so. My boss was an intimidating man, and when he gave a whole speech about the team spirit, I stood up and volunteered to work on Christmas. I knew that there was no getting out of this, but I was too afraid to tell Sarah the truth. 

It was an exhausting day at work, sorting through shelves and cleaning up after some stupid kid decided to puke all over the candy aisle. I was just at an absolute low. I've been working for this store for five years and I don't know my co-workers well enough. They absolutely hate their job, and it's plastered all over their faces. They hate their job so much that it makes me hate my job more. I dread coming into work and staring into their empty eyes, associating me with this place, as if it's my fault that they're here! WHAT THE FUCK!

I got in my car, relieved to be done with the day. On the way, I was seriously considering coming clean to my wife about not getting Christmas off, but I felt like it was too early for that. It's just a bad situation all around. All of a sudden, I just felt the urge to pee. I ignored it, intending to hold it all the way home. However, call it old age, or maybe it was something undiagnosed, I knew that if I didn't stop to find a place in the next five minutes, I'd pee all over myself. 

I stopped at the nearest locally owned, Joe's Gas Station. Next to the signboard was their ugly mascot, an anthropomorphic tree with comically tiny limbs and floating eyes. After rushing past a clerk, greeting him as I did, I went into the bathroom. I wash my hands after I'm done, still feeling the throbbing sensation in my bladder. And then, I see it. 

An open stall door, with a toilet seat that looked shiny and pristine. It wasn't well lit in there, but that thing glowed. It was as if I found something that wasn't from this world. It was almost ethereal. I felt like I was dreaming. Before I knew it, my body began to step closer to to it. I felt butterflies in my stomach. I did not know if my mortal eyes were worthy of seeing such a beauty. It smelled like freshly picked apples in there. I do not know why I deserved to be a part of such a fortunate experience, but I knew that after leaving, if I could bear to leave that is, I would be eternally grateful for this experience. I bent over, and after some nervousness, pressed my lips onto the seat. A shockwave ran through my body, chills ran down my back. Was this really happening? I couldn't control myself and felt my tongue shoot out, touching the seat and savoring the euphoria it produced in my body.

Filled with shock and horror, I stood up. What the fuck was I doing? I looked at the seat, and felt absolutely disgusted. I gagged, bracing myself against the wall, before throwing up into the sick. I felt horrible, and there was nothing I wanted more than to leave the place right then and there. 

The clerk standing outside the toilet gave me a dirty look as I walked past him. I don't know what he saw or heard, but I lowered my eyes in shame. I got into my car and began to drive back home.

I wanted to just get in a bath and get this day over with. I began to climb up the stairs to my apartment, when I heard something from inside that I didn't quite expect. Laughter.

I smiled, at least I get this at the end of the day. I rang the bell, and my wife answered. She looked at me, smiling.

"Yes?" She asked. 

"Sarah what's going on?" I asked curiously.

She looked confused, "Who are you?" 

"Sarah let me in, I'm tired." I said, not wanting to play along.  


"Honey!" Sarah yelled, panicked. 

What I saw next, shook my world.

Joe, from Joe's gas station, the fucking tree, was wearing my clothes with an arm around my wife's shoulders. His eyes floated above his head. They looked realistic but also cartoonish at the same time. Like one of those 2d Cakes people make on TikTok.

"You better get outta here pal, or we're gonna have a problem." The tree said aggressively. 

"Girls!" I yelled out, and I saw2 Jeanie and Paula emerge, looking at me from afar with fear and disgust.

"What the fuck!" I yelled.

"All right, I think I've had enough." The tree shut the door in my face and I heard hushed whispers inside.

I banged at the door over and over again, determined to get in.

"Open the fucking door!" I yelled. "Those are my kids in there!" I raged.

When the door wouldn't budge, I exited the apartment, thinkning of climbing the window. But the problem was,  I underestimated my own abilites. There was no way I would be able to climb six windows to get to mine. The first window was too high up for me to reach. And it wasn't like there were balconies on this side of the building.

I heard police sirens. Relieved, I waited for them to listen to my side of the story and put that green cunt behind bars. However, I ended up getting arrested for an attempted break in and endagering the life of children. 

In my cell, I was all alone. In this tiny town, there's almost nothing going on, and the jail wasn't much different. I looked up at the cieling, thinking of the what happened, when suddenly the toilet crossed my mind again. That pristine, clear bowl and the lick definitely had something to do with it.

"Hello, Clark." I heard a voice say. I jumped, looking around for the source. There was nothing around me. No one.

"Who is this?" I asked.

"The voice inside your head." The voice said. "Do you feel like you're lost?" 

"What the fuck is going on??" 

"The world is in a strange place right now. It has one more week to live Clark. What you're seeing isn't a dream."

"I fucking knew it!" I yelled. "I knew that I wasn't crazy."

"You're not crazy" The voice in my head said, "The world is ending in one week clark. The ancient one has awoken, thanks to you."

"Who are you?" I asked the voice inside my head.

"A herald of the end." It said. "I will tell you how the world ends. But you must not cry." 

I promised that I wouldn't.

After I heard what it had to say, I wept.
