Everyone needs their own dream world to escape to - otherwise, how would they cope with the daily misery of living? Mine is mermaids. 

It’s hard to explain why. I can only evoke the tingling pleasure of water flowing over your body as you twirl in it weightlessly ; the visual feast of underwater life, with its wild colors and unbounded invention ; the peace of being far away from the noises of the real world, listening only to the wordless songs of the ocean… I could go on and on. Mermaids give me joy. Mermaids are my refuge.

I was stoked when I discovered on a private subreddit that Mr. Poseidon’s Travelling Mermaid Show was coming to town. Mr. Poseidon is a hidden gem in the mermaid community. Mermaid shows are not a new thing per se - underwater dancers have been performing in mermaid costumes for a long time. But Mr. Poseidon’s show is deemed to be the best of them all. Performances are rare and never publicized. One either has to hear about them through secretive word-of-mouth, or be lucky enough to stumble upon one. 

Redditers who had seen the show kept saying that his mermaids looked unbelievably realistic. Some actually believed they were real. Finally, I had a chance to make up my own mind about it. 

\*\*\*\*\*

The coordinates shared on the subreddit led me to an empty field on the outskirts of town. An ocean-blue trailer sat there. On it were painted the words:

***Mr. Poseidon’s Travelling Mermaid Show***

***REAL*** ***Mermaids From The Deep Blue Sea***

Only a few people had gathered — a father with his young daughter, some lost-looking tourists and a couple of lone visitors (probably anonymous redditers from the same group I was on). But the air buzzed with anticipation.

We paid our entry fee to Mrs. Amphitrite. Named after the Greek goddess of the sea, Mrs. Amphitrite is a well-known character in Mr. Poseidon’s legend - his wife and right-hand woman. I have to admit her appearance surprised me. I was expecting a seductive marine creature - instead, I saw a gaunt little woman with a yellowish complexion. I wasn’t the only one to notice. Someone in the queue ahead of me asked her if she was doing okay.

“I’m fin-tastic.”

“Are you sure? You look a bit pale.”

“Too much time spent under the sea”, she replied with a strained smile. 

The ticket was embarrassingly expensive - a whole month's worth of tips. I didn’t care. Mermaids are the only thing in my life worth splurging on. 

The inside of the trailer was magical. The floor, ceiling and walls were lined with aquariums, so it felt like we had plunged beneath the ocean. A seashell-like hush filled the space, pierced occasionally by bright whistles of unseen fish.

When Mr. Poseidon entered, his looks also surprised me. He wasn’t the garish ringmaster I expected but a severe man in his sixties. Tall, distinguished, with eyes that radiated intelligence. If I’d come across him on the street, I would have guessed he was a judge or a surgeon. 

“Good afternoon, two-legged ladies and gentlemen.” He spoke slowly, like a man who controls every word and doesn’t let anyone interrupt him. ”Welcome to Mr. Poseidon’s Travelling Mermaid Show. Here, we do not lie. The creatures you are about to meet are not human. Cleo, Melusina and Lorelei are beautiful, graceful, mesmerising … *real* mermaids. Please, give them a warm welcome.”

We clapped enthusiastically. And we kept clapping. When the clapping died down, we waited breathlessly for the three creatures to appear … but nothing happened. After a while, the stillness became uncomfortable. 

Mr. Poseidon marched out of the trailer, then marched back in, looking slightly flustered. 

“Unfortunately, Lorelei has eaten some bad seaweed. This happens sometimes due to ocean pollution.”

A concerned "aaawww" rose from the audience. 

“Don’t worry, it’s just a pesky indigestion. After a good rest, she will be flapping her fins like nothing happened. In the meantime, Cleo and Melusina will entertain you.”

They swooped down from a hatch in the ceiling. The water embraced them like they belonged to it. With their hair flowing freely around their heads and their naked torsos swaying nonchalantly, they were both magical and earthy. 

The realism of it all was truly unbelievable. Usually, even the most skilfully crafted mermaid tails appear for what they are - manmade costumes. These girls’ tails were pure fish. Greasy, slimy fish tails that blended seamlessly into the skin. They looked full, too. When a mermaid performer spins underwater, the bump of the bended knees is always visible under the tail. Cleo and Melusina seemed to have no knees at all.

The prosthetics were simply amazing. The girls also had webbed hands and gills on the sides of their neck. The gills were not painted - I could see the water flowing in and out. What definitively blew my mind is that Cleo and Melusina stayed underwater for twenty minutes straight, without ever exiting the aquarium to take a breath nor using an underwater air hose. Maybe they had a hidden one, but for the life of me, I could not see it. 

I had always loved the mermaid myth without ever believing it was a scientific reality, but for a moment, I did believe. It was that good of a show.

\*\*\*\*\*

I exited the trailer with wings on my feet. After a few steps, my stomach started to twist. I was walking away from what might have been my only chance to make my dreams come true. 

Okay, I haven’t yet told you yet: I myself am a mermaid performer. I have taught myself the art best I could, practicing at the public swimming pool. In a small town like mine, mermaiding gigs are scarce. Kids’ parties, mostly. I yearned for the opportunity to ditch my waitressing job and become a professional mermaid full time. 

I knocked energetically on the trailer door. This was the time to be audacious or go home. Mr. Poseidon himself opened the door. He loomed over me, his head slightly cocked. 

“Yes?”

“I am a mermaid. Do you hire new mermaids?”, I blurted out. 

My cheeks instantly caught fire. That was so awkward. I thought Mr. Poseidon would burst out laughing, but he didn’t. He observed me silently - his gaze scanned every inch of my face, ran across my body down to my feet, then up again. Then, he stared into my eyes, eagerly, as if trying to read my soul.

Finally, the hint of a smile appeared on his thin lips. “Why not? We might need a replacement for Lorelei.”

\*\*\*\*\*

We slipped into a hidden compartment of the trailer. It was connected to the water tanks via a tube, large enough for a human to pass through.

“Show me what you can do.”

“What? Now? But I don’t have my mermaid outfit.”

“We’ll take care of that later”, he smirked, “If you are good enough, that is.”

In one of the many self-help books I perused to find some comfort, I had read that when you surrender yourself to your dreams, they have a way of coming true in the most unexpected ways. Maybe this was the way for me: stripping to my underwear in front of a strange (albeit brilliant) middle-aged man. As soon as I started pulling off my t-shirt, he courteously turned away. “I’ll be watching from the other side.”

\*\*\*\*\*

Three minutes later, I crawled out of the tube and plopped on the floor like a washed up fish. I had never held my breath for that long - there were indeed no air hoses in Mr. Poseidon’s aquarium. No way of stocking up on oxygen. That had thrown me into a little panic, but I had soldiered on, spinning and twirling away like the underwater princess I secretly believed myself to be. 

Mermaiding in that water tank was somehow easier than in a normal swimming pool - the water was saturated with salt, which made my body feel weightless, and there was no chlorine in it: instead, it had the pungent taste of fish. Despite the lack of a tail, I had never felt more like a mermaid. 

As I lay on the floor, gasping, I saw Mr. Poseidon’s stately figure tower over me.

“You are ready”, he said.

\*\*\*\*\*

It all went very fast. I signed the offer letter right then and there, without even reading it. Before handing me the pen, though, Mr. Poseidon explained to me that this was not a job like any other. It would entail me putting myself through intense physical conditioning and travelling around the country with them. Essentially, I would be leaving my old life behind. 

I couldn’t wait to leave my old life behind.

That very evening, I quit my job, told the few friends I had that I was joining a traveling circus (I actually said that), packed a bag and hopped into Mr. Poseidon’s truck. 

We drove off into the night - Mr. Poseidon at the wheel, Mrs. Amphitrite riding shotgun, and me in the middle. 

“I brought my tail. I don’t know if it’s pretty enough but I thought I’d bring it anyway”, I said apologetically. 

Mr. Poseidon chuckled. Mrs. Amphitrite didn’t react at all. I gave a nervous laugh, not knowing what else to do. After a while, I tried again.

“Can I meet the other girls?”, I asked.

“Oh, you will,” Mr. Poseidon replied, “They are resting in their pool at this time.”

At that, Mrs. Amphitrite turned her head to the window and stared out, although it was too dark to make out anything but shifting shadows. It occurred to me that the two of them had perhaps had a fight. I didn’t want to think that the legendary king and queen of the sea were unhappy in their marriage, but I understood that even the best relationships had their hiccups. 

So I decided to respect their silence and folded up into my own thoughts. I was frightened, of course. Even I -  starstruck and desperate as I was - could tell that I had stepped into something very strange. I remind myself that destiny sometimes comes into being through the most unusual paths.

\*\*\*\*\*

A few hours later, we pulled up to a deserted warehouse. I glanced back at the stretch of road we had come from. For a moment, I imagined myself running as fast as my legs could carry me, lost perhaps, but protected by the darkness. I knew this was my last chance to escape. 

“Are you coming?”, Mr. Poseidon thundered as he rolled up a screeching garage door. 

A pitiful whimper escaped my mouth.

“Ho-ho-ho, are you scared?” He sounded like Santa Claus, all of a sudden. 

“We made our headquarters here so that no one can find us”, he continued, “We are a secretive operation, don’t you know?”

The wheels of logic started grinding in my brain. Of course, that made sense. I imagined myself again, running away like a hysterical idiot and being fired by Mr. Poseidon on the spot. Did I or did I not want to be part of an exclusive mermaiding ensemble built on mystery and elusiveness? I picked up my bag and marched into the warehouse.

\*\*\*\*\*

I laid on a mattress, listening to the ominous sounds that echoed from the depths of the building. Creaking metal. Dripping water. Soft bumps. 

Mr. Poseidon had apologized for the spartan setup — a mattress, a sink, a water closet. “Life on the road”, he’d said. The cold and the nervousness were making it hard to fall asleep. I forced myself to keep my eyes shut - I needed to be rested to do a good job. 

Just as I was beginning to drift off, a horrible sound jolted me awake. It was a cry of pain, so tormented that it made me shiver to my core. If you’ve never heard a cry like that, you wouldn’t be able to imagine it. It’s a sound that could only come from a torture chamber or a deathbed - human in origin, but transformed into something inhuman because the pain that caused it was too great for a human to bear. 

The cry continued into a hopeless wail. I had to do something.

\*\*\*\*\*

I roamed the vast, dark rooms of the warehouse, the wailing my only guide. The closer I got to it, the more revulsed I felt. I knew that I was walking toward something intolerable. Yet, the revulsion was overpowered by the urgency to help another living creature.

When I finally found them, they were huddled together in an inflatable pool. The water was yellow with the pus that oozed from her body. Cleo and Melusina held her hands, one on each side of her. Their faces contorted in a grimace, they shared in her pain because they were powerless to relieve it.

And in the center was Lorelei, reduced to a corpse still struggling to die. The whole of her, from her sweat-drenched hair to her rotting fish tail, was a massive, quavering infection. 

“You should be in your room.”

I turned around - Mr. Poseidon was calmly walking towards me. His face did not betray the slightest emotion. Mrs. Amphitrite appeared behind him. She looked flustered, hair disheveled.

“I’m so sorry, my love, I forgot to lock her in!” she exclaimed plaintively. 

“You’re being forgetful lately", he responded, “That’s alright. We might as well get it done tonight.”

Only then did I notice the massive syringe in his hand. Before I could make a move, his impossibly long arm sped towards me and stabbed me in the neck.

\*\*\*\*\*

The next thing I remember is a long, silent night. Then the night became icy and liquid. It wasn’t quite so silent anymore, as the silence itself produced noise - in fact, it was not silence but a powerful rumble, a concentration of a thousand sounds crushed by the weight of the water.

I was swimming in the blind depths of the ocean. And I couldn’t breathe.

I opened my eyes and mouth at the same time. I gulped a breath of stale air. A stained ceiling loomed above me. It took me a few seconds to realize that I was lying on a seedy motel bed, wrapped in a stinking sheet.

Mrs Amphitrite was in the room with me - pacing back and forth, possessed by some torturous thought.

“Mrs Amphitrite…” I whispered, my voice hoarse.

She jerked her head towards me. Her eyes were wide, alarmed, as if she were expecting something terrible to happen.

“Wh-what’s going on..?” I breathed.

“The anaesthesia hasn’t worn off yet. You’re lucky. For now.”

I had no idea what she was talking about.. I needed to go to the restroom. Splash cold water on my face.

My legs felt groggy beneath the sheets. I rolled to the edge of the bed and pushed my legs over, sitting up. For some reason, I couldn’t feel the floor under my feet. 

I looked down.

My legs were gone. 

The screams came out like the helpless cries of a baby chick. It was pathetic. I was pathetic. So I started laughing at myself. While I laughed, prickly tears filled my eyes.

Mrs. Amphitrite sat down next to me. “Shhhhhhh, it’s okay. Let’s talk about it.”

\*\*\*\*\*

I sipped some tasteless motel tea while Mrs. Amphitrite steeled herself to explain to me why my body now ended just below my butt cheeks. Somehow, she looked more miserable than I did.

“This was the first operation. The leg removal. The second operation would be the tail transplant.”

“How would I pee and poop with a tail?” The question had come to me like an epiphany.

“Oh, he’s thought of that”, she responded eagerly, as if she were delivering exciting news. “He installs a tube from the orifices to the cloaca. Fish have one too - it’s a little vent at the bottom of the tail.”

“Oh. Okay.”

“While the tail transplant heals, he uses skin from the removed legs to web the hands. That’s an easy operation, because the skin comes from your own body. Finally, he adds the gills. He connects them to the trachea. That usually causes a lot of bloating in the face, but if the infection subsides, then the gills work quite well. For a bit.”

“For how long?”

Mrs. Amphitrite’s eyes darted in all directions, feverish.

“A month, maybe.”

“And then what happens?”

“Transplant rejection… haaaaaa!”, she waved her hand in front of her face, as if to chase away a ghost. “Those poor girls!”

She looked at me pleadingly. “He’s not a bad man, you know. He believes in mermaids. But I can’t do this anymore. This is not right.”

“Can you take me to the hospital, please?”

“Yes. Yes I will.” 

There was an old telephone on the nightstand. She lifted the receiver, then put it back down.

“Maybe this time would have worked better, you know? He was going to use a coelacanth’s tail. It’s an ancient fish, closely related to mammals. In fact, it has the closest matching DNA to humans of any fish.”

When she was done talking, she started slapping herself. 

\*\*\*\*\*

Mrs. Amphitrite has been snoring for hours. She drank the whole minibar. I don’t think she wanted to take me to the hospital, but she also didn’t want to not take me to the hospital. 

I suspect that when she sobers up, she’ll make up her mind and drive me back to Mr. Poseidon.

I found a phone in her pocket. I could have used it to call 911. Maybe the healthiest part of her mind left the phone there so I could save myself. Instead, I used it to type this post. 

I’ve been doing some thinking. I’m not so sure I want to go back to my life without legs. I mean, I was miserable before. How miserable could I possibly be as a half-body? I wouldn’t even be able to wait tables anymore. 

Maybe I could live out my last few months as a mermaid. It would be brief, it would end painfully, but it would also be bloody cool. 

I’m not sure what to do.
