A few years ago, a friend of mine went to a hotel and he booked a single room by himself, during daytime, he went down disovering the different amenities the hotel had to offer, and he sat by the pool enjoying the sunlight.  
  
At night, he went up to his room, took a shower and layed down on the bed to relax and get some sleep, it was at this moment when he started hearing noises of someone "running in circles" as he described it, he said it sounded like someone was running in circles in the same spot and he was sure that the noise was coming from the room on the floor below him, he went to the balcony to take a look, but he couldn't see anything, so he didn't pay much attention, ignored the noise and got back to his bed trying to sleep, only the noise started sounding louder and louder, "it was the same noise of someone running in circles around the same spot, only it sounded like he was running faster", he said.  
  
He left his room and he went down to the hotel reception, the receptionnist asked him "can i help you, sir?" and my friend told him that someone very loud was disturbing him with weird noises in the room below his, the receptionnist was looking strangely at my friend and he told him "there is no one in the room below you, sir." my friend refused to believe that and he asked the receptionnist to double-check, so the receptionnist told my friend "come with me, sir.", and he took him to the exact same room he was referring to, the one below his, the receptionnist put the keys in the lock and he opened the door of that room, it was a small empty room that smelled of detergent and was full of janitor equipement, the receptionnist then looked at my friend and he told him "see, i told you there is no one in the room below you, sir."  
  
My friend thought he was probably imagining the noise was coming from the room below, but he thought it was probably from the room on the floor above him, so he asked the receptionnist "what about the room above mine? Is there anyone there?" the receptionnist responded "no sir, to my knowledge, no one checked into that room either" so my friend thought he was probably hallucinating or sleep deprived and he went back up to his room, he layed down on the bed, turned off the lights, and he was trying to sleep again.  
  
A few seconds later he started hearing the same noise again, so he opened his eyes again, turned the lights back on, and he was surprised to see something even more peculiar, it was smoke that smelled like tobacco that was coming out of the walls, i asked him "was the smoke coming out of the air conditionner vent?" and he said "no, the smoke was coming out of the wall itself" he quickly got up and went looking up and down the balcony again to see if there is anyone smoking in the rooms below and above his, which he knew were empty, but he was deeply scared and frustrated that he still wanted to double-check.  
  
He wasn't able to get any sleep that night, he packed up his things and he checked out of the hotel the next morning.  
  
When i asked for his opinion or interpretation of was happening at that hotel during his stay, he said that he was sure there was some kind of paranormal activity or sorcery going on, and said that he will set foot in that hotel again.
