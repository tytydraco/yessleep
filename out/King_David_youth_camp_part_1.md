January 3rd 2019

I’ve been having weird dreams about a church camp I went to in high school so I decided I’d share them with all of your. For a bit of context my father was a pastor and I was pretty involved in the church and its youth group. Every year they partnered up with every other church in the county and we’d go out to kind David church camp for a week. I can’t remember exactly where it was but it’s about 7 hours away  of the small town I lived in.   


January 6th 2019.  Okay so like I’ve said I was about 16 when I went to the camp I’m 26 now so all of this happened okay now here’s the first dream I had 

“Goodbye dad I’ll see you whenever we get back” my dad had just dropped me off at the entrance to the church and a few minutes later we were all in the van and on our way up to the camp I was sat next to the girl I had a crush on at a time so this was a win. “Hey Irene do you have anything your looking forward to doing while we’re up there” she was beautiful her hair golden blonde with a few streaks of pink dye at the tips “huh oh yeah i think im going to do the rafting trip what about you Joel” I was pretty scared of water after I almost drown as a kid but in typical teenage boy fashion “oh really same I totally love rafting maybe we can go on the same raft that’ll be fun”  

Was I terrified to go in the water. Yes but was seeing her in a bikini for 6 hours was a total win she chuckled at me thinking about it now she probably knew how scared I was “yeah that’d be nice let’s just hope it doesn’t rain. I think I’m going to take a nap wake me up when we’re close or if you see anything cool Joel” she rested her head on the window and a few minutes later she was asleep I was gonna ask her out some time during the week but for now sleep didn’t sound that bad next thing I knew the van stopped. My eyes opened to see I had fallen asleep on her shoulder “it’s about time you woke up” she smiled down on me her beautiful blue eyes felt like they could stare into my soul itself

“O-oh yeah sorry I didn’t realize I had fallen asleep” I sat up and fixed my hair up a bit trying to distract from my bright red face 
“It’s okay Joel I didn’t mind you looked peaceful I thought I’d let you sleep were almost there so I’m going to start packing my things up”  I decided to do the same packing my backpack up as I saw the clearing in the trees. We parked and all 20 kids from my youth group got out of the van I was helping bring everyone’s bags out of the trailer when I saw him. Charles the rich asshole of the lot walk over to Irene and start tossing out pickup lines at her she laughed him off and walked away to the girls cabins. 

To my deepest disappointment when I got assigned my cabin Charles was sharing a bunk with me. Maybe he wasn’t all that bad but he was my rival. 
“Hello Joel I see you’ve taken the top bunk”
“Yeah what the hell about it you gonna buy it off me”
“No you really think that little of me just because I’m going after your girl oh wait she’s not yours is she”
“Just shut up asshole let’s just get along for this week okay”

With that we ended the argument and headed off to the first sermon there was 2 each day but since we got there in the evening we only got the long intro message. there was a new speaker then normal he looked young definitely super attractive and charismatic “hello everyone as you all could guess I’m new I was just hired but I hope I’ll be as good as your last pastor im Adam for tonight well be doing some games. But first let’s talk about camp rules as you can expect no drugs alcohol or anything else like that okay I doubt any of you would but I’m required to say that 

Second rule no girls in the boys cabins and no boys in the girls simple right it’s church camp your here to get filled with new life not make a new one” a few people laughed at that one   my eyes grew heavy and I fell asleep for the rest of the rules not like I hadn’t heard them all before when I woke up he was at the end of his sermon. “Oh and one last thing none of you go out of your cabins past 11 pm I know thats early but there will be severe punishment if you’re  caught out so don’t risk it”. We headed back to the cabin and all checked in for the night the bathroom in our cabin had an out of order sign posted on it. 

We all went to bed and  at  2:47 am I felt the call of nature I knew it was quote on quote forbidden to go out but I climbed up the hill into the trees and started to take a leak  I looked down at the chapel it look ghostly at this time of night when I saw maybe 2 or 3 people start to walk out of it I started to get closer but next thing I knew it was all black I woke up in my bunk the next morning.
