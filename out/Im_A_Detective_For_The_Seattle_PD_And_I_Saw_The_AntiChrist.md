(Part 1 of 2)

It’s rare I encounter a case so disruptive to my sanity that remedies outside the standard three amigos- alcohol, tobacco, and driving after both- fall short, and a more conscious outlet is required. So rare that it hasn’t been necessary until now. The case I’ve been confronted with for the past couple of months has inspired feelings I’ve haven’t shouldered since I was a rookie; the balancing on the edge of disillusion and vomit, the thermostat being dialed up in my body, the utter dread.

I suppose I’ve exhausted any material to stall with. God, deliver me.

Abraham’s sweat pooled in puddles across his body but his resolve carried his foot, not his muscle. His brow quivered and his body begged but before Immanuel, he would not relent.

No coffee hits the mouth as stale and bitter as lukewarm, 2004-Keurig coffee in a tiny white mug with the askew crest of the Department shittly printed on. It's not good but it's stiffer than a penguin in heat and that’s all it needs to be. You’d have to be God’s favorite soldier to find an ounce of sugar or creamer in the same block as the coffee that swam in that yellowed glass pot. You drank it black or didn’t drink it at all.

It took me 3 years as a detective for the drowning cat of a city that is Seattle to manage drinking a whole cup of the coffee and 10 before I gave up on trying to cover up the distinct jet fuel taste. Even after 26 years of drinking that *venom* I still wasn’t able to take a sip and not pucker and twitch slightly.

It was the 20th of March and-

Under the bush, the snake grinned.

As was typical, the weather outside was grey. The sky had begun weeping early the night before and showed no signs of getting a hold of itself anytime soon. I relish the memory of those few moments before the rain let up and Sargent Solomon, clutching his belt, peeked in to say: “Gabe, mount up. Triple Homicide. Pier 55, follow the lead unit.” He tapped on the doorframe then left toward the elevator. 

It’s akin to having a noose tied around your neck and a bag on your head while you walk down a staircase that after one step or another just drops off. By setting the mug down and pulling on my coat, I had started walking down.

“Christ on a stick. Who woke up with piss in their chalice?” 3 victims. 1 man, 1 woman, and 1 unlucky lamb. The Pier itself was walled in by million-ton tanker ships; these walls plus a radical amount of accidental and purposeful deaths along the Pier had been rewarded with the title: The Valley Of Death. Though the sky lacked its tears, the sea still crashed and broke against the walls of the docks.

The man’s testicals were sheared off at the stump and placed above the dismembered roots of a tree. The left and right cheek of his face were peeled part of the way off and lifted back to form horns. Adding to the silhouette, his ribcage was split and pulled back in blood eagle- blood angel- wings. “Adam Appelbaum, 33.”

“Bit on the nose.” I replied, sipping a Red Bull from the cooler in my cruiser.

“Careful, too many of those you’ll end up like little-angel there.” Chief Temple, gruffed as he tucked his hat into the crook of his armpit. 

“Ha fucking ha. Welcome to the ritualistic murder.”

“Anything better than home.” 

“What? Wife got you on the couch?”

“Wife’s at her sister’s, and probably not coming back.” I frowned then awkwardly turned back to the corpse. 

The woman had suffered a hysterectomy and provided in the art piece was a jar of black: “*Period blood.* Crazies provide labels now?” The jar had a strip of masking tape along it with its contents labeled.

The lamb was the least disgraced. Bolt to the head, laid to draining out on a white sheet below the two mutilated. Laid out ceremonially around them was an inverted pentagram. “At least they’re loyal. Love their symbols. Assessment?”

All three victims shared 72 small tally cuts into their backs and one large stab wound in the nape of the neck. All three bodies were stiff and ice cold, yet the distinct stench of death was low-hanging and ferocious. All three bodies looked at some state of elevated peace and contentment. It was far clearer on the humans, for obvious reasons, but it would be a feat of criminal oversight to not notice it on the lamb’s.

“Well might be a stretch to say ritualistic, but I could make a case for it.” Cops are easy to make laugh ‘cause they’re hard to make squirm. “Might not be an apple but his cherries are overtop the roots. God’s curse to women in a jar. Why a lamb and not a snake? Not much clue, your homework is genesis, read up, and answer that for me. The man, Adam, is mocked up as the devilish figure… purpose? Lost as a camel in the sewer.”

“Well it’s a start. Bag all this up if you’d kindly, if rain rolls back in before forensics get here they’ll throw a bitch-fit.”

“Loud and clear.”

I bagged the roots. Then, the jar. Then, lastly and begrudgingly, the cherries.

“Eat.” He cooed. “The moment the fruit touches thy tongue all to be known, shall be known.”

“But what of the warnings of the Almighty?”

“The Almighty of Half-Truths. Eat… Eat… and learn all he doesn’t want you to learn.”

“How can I trust you over my Father?”

“Take your hand, search your body. Do you feel cloth? Linen? Cotton? Or flesh?”

“What is cotton, linen, what is cloth?”

“Precisely. Eat.” 

And he ate.

It’s crass, but as I bagged the bag, a whimper of voice called out. No language or letters comprised the words because they weren’t words. It guided, cooed. And as if by a silent sermon, I-

***

The knowledge crashed in like a flood, the knowing. There were no longer just trees in the garden, all that remained was Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, and Carya tomentosa, and Prunus andersonii. As they ate of the fruit, they-

Knew. I knew what was waiting for me in the water. Parker looked at me like I was insane as I climbed down the ladder to the side of the Pier. The crashing waves speared 20 feet past the walls of the dock routinely and; just in the time from reaching the Pier; I had seen spurts as high as 50. The ladder itself was more rust than metal and was slightly concave from the beating waves. Any good mind wouldn’t trust the ladder as far as they could throw one of the tankers, but I haven’t a good mind and maybe that’s why it held. Maybe that’s the waves slammed to either side of me, but not into me. 

My hand dipped into the bubbly water, past the wrist. As I gripped the knife sitting contently and still in the sloshing waters, I knew it impossible for a metal blade such as this to sit even 100 meters from the surface- let alone a measly 4 inches below the stirring surface.

“I got a weapon here!”

***

“Guard- my cherubim- the gate to the garden, and the flaming sword I have set here. And as for you!” The snake shivered. “I know your true shape. But for this grievous infraction, I shall only curse the one you take now. You shall be doomed to slither along the ground from now till extinction. Your image will not be that of just another reptile, but the ultimate iconography of sin. Why any entity, let alone one of my kin, thinks it has the power to work beyond my peripheral disgusts me. I am the Law and nothing exists beyond me.”

“All things but me… Remain in the eye of God?” I spoke in a shuddering translation.

“Since when did you learn latin?” Temple asked.

“Didn’t even know it was latin.”

“Very funny. Toss it.” This pulled me from my gridlocked stupor.

“What? Why? It’s a possible murder weapon?”

“It's a shitty little knife you found floating on the water? Ya hear of many real knives floating? Probably some toy one of these micks pulled out of a container during the unloading. Toss it, ‘less you want forensics trying to find out what Taiwanese factory it was molded in.” 

“It wasn’t on the surface…” I grumbled but trailed off before I finished the thought. 

“What?” He barked.

“Tossing it.” I chimed, then bagged it the moment he turned his back. “Take that to Hildi,” (Our beloved forensic examiner.) “And get it checked against the stab wounds. I may not be a tech, but fuck me if that ain’t a match.” I muttered to Parker and passed the bagged blade from my chest to the lining of his overcoat. 

“How did yo- alright.” He pushed his hand into his pocket and moved the jowls of the coat to consume the bag.

“Thank you.”

“I trust your judgement more than anyone's.” It’s not wrong to say I’m old- it's hurtful- but not wrong. Of the 246 concurrent officers and agents working out of the Seattle Department, I was the only one remaining from the pre-2000s. Behind me were a couple blueshirts, and behind them was the captain. But even still, the most senior blueshirt was still 4 years my junior. I’ve been here a long time, not entirely a good time. 

“Cap, I’m gonna do a run of questioning, see if I can get any statements from the Pier crew.”

“Okay, keep it quick, techs are almost here. I’m leaving, it’s colder than a witch’s tit in a brass bra out here.”

“Adious, I expect dinner when I get home. Help your mother set the table.” 

“Somebody’s a fuckin’ comedian today.” He sneered as he dropped into his cruiser. “Greasy cun-.” and the door shut. I held the smile until he was out of sight.

“Who crawled up his ass?” Parker asked.

“Get that to Hildi, ASAP. I’m running statement duty.” 

“When are you clearing?”

“I’m leaving with the techs.”

“Shit, good luck.” Parker patted me on the back and left shortly after.

And from the sky, the gates opened. A rechistening to bathe all the dirty children. But when the pearls parted, sand fled and borne from the adversary: Fire came. But nothing escapes the sight of God, and the sand turned to water.

“Are you sure you didn’t see anything?”

“No sir, bodies were here when we got here.” The Irishmen- micks as Temple called them, only half kidding- said as he reset the grinder his partner was using to cut the locks on the recently docked containers.

“And that… wasn’t odd to you?” My pen hadn’t moved in about 30 people; every person questioned before this man had given me the same answer: “Here when we got here.”  

“You work here long enough, you see bodies wash up, you see people jump in and not come up, you see the occasional execution. It’s no free quickie (suprise) to see a couple a year. You get used to it as fucked as it is to say.”

“Al- Alright.” I gave up, 52 people and I got nothing.. “Something’s off.” 

Marques raised an eyebrow. “What?”

“How does someone dump bodies in the center of a Pier and no one notices, let alone not care?”

“Well you heard him: Dumped here when they got here, they probably just saw the bodies, called it in, and moved on.” Marques was a stout black kid who had ridden a full ride academic scholarship from Highschool to Yale to Seattle as a forensics specialist. He was smart, book smart, and could be a damn fine detective but thought the field of forensics was more tailored to him. I tried to convince to go through the academy a number of times, but he never did and I doubt he ever will.

“Not buying it.”

“What? That they didn’t see anything? Seems a little… conspiratorial.” He worked a pair of metal rods, one with a mirror on the end, searching through the mouths of the victims.

“No no, not that. I know they didn’t see shit, which makes me more concerned.” Marques turned to me and raised an eyebrow. “I’m not buying the bodies were here when they got here.”

“How would they not see bodies get dumped and a whole satanic mural set up?”

“How would none of this wash away in the rain?” He was silent.

“Shit.”

“Exactly.”

“No, shit as in I just found something, that’s a whole mic-drop too, but…” He fished for a long pair of forceps, wormed the instrument to back the male victim’s mouth, and extracted a stinking bag. 

Inside was: “Apple seeds, and- god it stinks- teeth… You’re dentist adjacent; what kind of teeth are those?” 

“Those are… wisdom teeth, but…” He paused then dove back into the mouth of the victims. “How many teeth?”

“16.”

“Bad news, good news, which do you want first?”

“Bad.”

“Bad news, none of the vics here are missing teeth. Good news, they have great teeth.” He chuckled slightly and I exhaled something akin to a chuff. 

“So we got what? 8 more victims, at least?”

“That or we’re looking for a very religious dentist.”

And unto the Earth the water approaches, dawning. With the ground ablaze and the sky glittering with falling water, Noah tarred the Ark. His work must hasten, mere weeks remain before the waters would extinguish the fires and life.

All that will remain is 2 of each animal, and the 8 members of Noah’s family including himself.

The drive home even 2 weeks later was odd. Low laying dread churred in the tires of my 2011 ford shitbox. A series of infractions upon the natural way of the world had induced some clinical uprooting. An algorithmic breakdown and reconstruction that had targeted the organized logic I had labeled and drawered and boxed so meticulously. The table laid like this: 3 dead; 1 male, 1 female, 1 lamb; with a pocketed 8 in the possession of whoever committed this crime. Textbook religious iconography but with elements of traditional biblical myth altered. “Eve gave the fruit to Adam.” This thought bounced around in an  echo chamber that was unproductive for almost 16 days at this point. Why paint Adam as the instigator? Why a lamb and not a snake?

“Becasue the form was cursed.” My hand flinched against the wheel and despite the angle only being shifted slightly, the car squirmed and tensed, sending its back wheels out of control. The voice, the silent serial sermoner, once more whispered without words into my ear. The words had left my own lips, repeating what I had been told, instants before convulsing and sending my car off the road. It came to a rest in the ditch. Nothing was broken other than my right mirror, but much more had been displaced. Voices don’t come from the sky, they murmur to you in the corners of your mind, in the corners you thought only your mind can whisper to itself. 

My breath bubbled in my throat and slowly gained the confidence to be exhaled out into the frightening world. “Because the form was cursed.” It didn’t take long for me to forget about the crash and start back on the road, coasting 20 over. The brakes squealed as I docked it and the lights flashed rapidly as I leapt out and ran for the nearest bible. The bookstore would closed, but the library closest to my house was 24/7. I bolted in, scanned my library card and pulled a Bible off the shelf.

My knowledge of the Bible was limited, I had gone through some indoctrinatorial Sunday School sessions as a teen after my mom died and my dad found Christ. It never stuck with me but I never discredited it, it was a theory of the world and I’d be a shitty detective to turn down a theory. I gave God his merits as a stand up guy who I was confident would be fun to have a beer with, but in the same way I thought superman would be. Fictional until proven real. But now my nose was 6 feet deep into the Bible and my brain was 5 cups deep into self-serve coffee provided in the cafe. 

I checked out the Bible around 4 am and drove home in a hope to scavenge the 3 hours I had till work began for something akin to sleep. I found it in the driveway, having parked my car and not even reaching the handle.
