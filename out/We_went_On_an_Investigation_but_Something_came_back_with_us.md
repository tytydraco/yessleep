My name is Evaline and my sister who is vital to this as well is named Vivian and we are twins aged twenty-three. Yesterday we went on a graveyard investigation, and I don't think we came back alone.  
We pulled up to the graveyard In Vivians beat up red bug. She shut off the car and looked over to me.   
“I have a weird feeling, Evaline, are you sure you want to do this?” asked Vivian.  
“Oh yeah everyone keeps telling me about this place!” I exclaimed.   
As we exited the car and walked up to the property Vivian turned on the ghost box (A tool used for communicating with ghosts by scanning through radio frequencies and white noise).  
The ghost box said one word very abruptly “STOP.”   
We looked at each other with puzzled faces.   
“Do you not want us here?” asked Vivian.   
“STOP.’ Came through the ghost box again.   
“Uh color me crazy but I think we should still go in.” I said.   
Vivian looked at me for a moment and then agreed we heard one final “STOP.” as we entered and then it was dead silent for 15 minutes.   
We were walking around when my sister Vivian stopped and looked at a specific tree. This tree is twisted looking literally it has two parts to it that twist together to make sort of an arch way.   
“A woman is over there.” Vivian whispered and pointed towards the tree (Vivian Is a medium by the way)  
“Well let’s go check It out.” I enthusiastically said.   
As we reached the tree the ghost box said the name “ANNIE.”   
Vivian Greeted Annie and asked her why she was there.   
But I was more Interested In trying to find Annie’s headstone.   
“Hey, ask her for her last name!” I shouted over to Vivian who gave me a thumbs up.  
I walked further away scanning all the different headstones with my flashlight. Some of these guys are really old, like 17th century old.   
“Maybe that’s why it’s so haunted.” I thought to myself.  
As I looked up to scan the next headstone, I saw a figure of a man standing by a headstone. “Holy shit where'd he come from?” I thought “Hey Vivian do you see hi-” I cut off because when I pointed back to where I saw him no one was there.  
“Okaayyy.” I said in a hushed tone “I’m just going to go walk over there and see what the headstone says.” I made my way over to the headstone.  
 “Oh no way Vivian come over here, look who I found!” I shouted   
“What’s up, what'd you find?” Vivian asked excitedly.  
She looked down as I shined my flashlight on the fading stone the words “Annie Forester Beloved Mother and Wife” were shown.   
“ME.” Said the ghost box We both looked at each other. We normally don’t get very intelligent responses so this was a big deal.   
“What happened to you Annie?” I asked “HUNG.”   
“Oh Jesus, that took a dark turn.” I said   
“Evaline, stop it.” Vivan shouted, "Can you tell us why?” she asked,   
“WITCH.”  
“Oh she must have been a part of the old witch hunts that happened all through England and Ireland.” Vivian said   
“Yeah but why are you still here Annie?” I asked Nothing happened for a good five minutes before the response   
“TO PROTECT” came through.  
“Protect what Annie?” I asked another few minutes pass by before the ghost box says “THE LAND”  
 “Huh that's awfully sweet of you do you make sure the living are safe?” Asked Vivian   
“YES” the ghost box replied almost Immediately   
“LEAVE” It says.  
“Why do you want us to leave?” I asked   
“Yeah what's wrong Annie?” Asked Vivian  
“HIM”  
“Who is him?” Asked Vivian  
“PLEASE GO”   
Those were the last words the ghost box said for another twenty minutes  
“Maybe we should go, it's been a while and we haven't gotten anything else.” Said Vivian  
I Looked around the graveyard I had a bad feeling  
“Yeah lets get outta here this place is starting to creep me out.” I said as I stood and shook myself off trying to get rid of the odd energy.  
We packed up all of our things and headed to the entrance. We said a prayer so nothing negative would follow us and threw our bags in the trunk. As I opened the door I slumped down In the passenger seat.   
“Phew.” I breathed   
“We got some pretty good stuff from Annie. I just wanna know who the mysterious him is.” Giggled Vivian  
The drive home was uneventful but I couldn’t shake that odd energy from my body.  
“Hey Viv do you feel weird or is that just a me thing?” I asked looking over at Vivian  
“Mmm yeah ever since we left I felt odd, hopefully it's just our nerves.” Vivian said with a warm smile. But something was hidden behind the warmth of her smile : fear.  
We pulled up to the house and unloaded our bags onto the kitchen table. It's become sort of a ritual at this point, every time we finish an investigation we unpack and load in all the recordings to listen to with high quality noise canceling headphones. We also order some kind of takeout tonight's meal of champions was Chinese food my favorite.  
I stirred together my orange chicken and rice as I pawed through the recordings settling on the third one when Annie mentions “HIM”. The recording fills my ears as I intently listen.  
“LEAVE.” Says the ghost box   
“Why do you want us to leave?” you can hear us asking  
“HIM” the ghost box says   
“Who is him?” Vivian’s voice says  
I listen closely as silence fills the space   
“I'm Him.” A deep voice says not over the voice box but right next to the recorder.  
I screamed and jumped out of my seat throwing the headphones on the ground.  
“What what what!” Says Vivian  
“Oh hell no, that sounded like satan.” I said laughing In disbelief  
I rewinded the recording so Vivian could hear it. I saw her face turn into a huge grin.  
“Now this is solid stuff we have to go back there!” Exclaimed Vivian  
“Yeah I'm down but you're reviewing the tapes next time that voice is creepy.” I said with a smile  
“Deal!” Said Vivian as she stuck her hand out for a hand shake. I took it and shook hands.  
“I'm gonna get ready for bed Viv goodnight!” I yelled as I walked away   
“Goodnight!” yelled Vivian  
I stepped into the poorly lit bathroom and turned on the shower   
“That voice is seriously creepy.” I muttered to myself as I took out my High ponytail and let my dark brown curls bounce down to my shoulders. My hair always did look nice with my pale skin  
“Thanks to you mom.” I said looking up at the ceiling   
I stepped into the shower and started washing my hair when I heard something fall.   
I opened the shower curtain to see the culprit my cat Leo  
“Oh Leo you're going to be the death of me.” I puffed out closing the shower curtain again  
Another crash comes from outside the shower curtain  
“Leo Get ou-” I ripped open the curtain to find the toilet paper holder in the sink   
I stared dumbfounded as to how my small cat could have body builder lifted the toilet paper holder into the sink.   
“VIIIIVIAN” I screamed  
Heavy footsteps pound down the hallway but no Vivian   
“Vivian?” I called   
Pounding assaulted the walls to the point they were vibrating as the footsteps continued  
“VIVIAN” I endlessly scream for what seems like hours until the door bursts open and the walls stop pounding immediately  
“Are you okay, what's wrong, what's going on?” Exclaimed Vivian with a very worried look.  
“You didn't hear me screaming for you?” I sobbed  
“No, I just now heard you and came in. What happened?” asked Vivian  
I told her all of the events that had just occurred she looked towards the sink and back to me with a confused face  
“The toilet paper holder isn't in the sink Evaline.” She said pointing towards the sink which was in fact empty  
“What no I swear it was!” I exclaimed  
“I believe you Evaline you never cry it's just odd try and get some sleep okay maybe you're really tired? Cooed Vivian  
“Yeah maybe” I said  
I finished my shower without any problems and climbed into bed.Covering myself with the plushy blanket I let sleep take me over.  
“Evaline wake up!” Vivian yell whispered as she shook me awake  
“What's going on?” I groggily asked and then I heard it pounding on the walls but it was everywhere The walls were all slightly shaking  
“Is this what happened in the bathroom?” Vivian asked me   
“Yeah pretty much just not as loud.” I said standing up I'm gonna go check it out stay her Vivian  
“You're that white girl that dies in the horror movie.” Vivian said with a smirk  
I shook my head and stepped out into the hallway. Literally all of the walls seemed to be buzzing with the pounding. I made my way past the family portraits and got to the back door slowly putting my hand on the door knob and twisting it till I quickly pulled it open and the pounding stopped. I Looked around the dark backyard and I noticed something: the figure of a man standing by our fence. I looked closer trying to get a better look it was definitely a man.  
I turned around to grab the bat sitting on our porch.  
“Hey buddy you better beat it!” I yelled, turning back with bat in arm to see he was gone.  
“Weird.” I thought and went back inside the house. I closed the back door and turned to walk back to Vivian when I saw the shadowy man standing right in front of me.  
“AH-” I started to scream but the air seemed to be sucked from my lungs and the only thing that came out was a small peep.  
“I don’t like you creatures.” The man said in a voice I can’t even begin to describe. It wasn't human.  
“But still you exist to only displease me.” He went on   
“Who are you?” I stammered  
“You wouldn't know the word but you gave a soul hope tonight which made her free of me so now I need another soul in return for the one you greedily took.” The man like thing said  
“Annie?” I asked shakily  
He made an odd gurgling crunching noise reminiscent of a laugh but sounded more like a garbage disposal.   
“Obviously” he replied   
“Now you're going to replace that soul.” He said calmly  
“Evaline?” Vivian placed her hand on my shoulder   
“Evaline Are you there helloooo?” Vivan said snapping her fingers in front of my eyes  
“Yeah sorry Viv I just was thinking.” I replied  
Now i'm writing this to you hoping someone out there knows what this thing is and how to get rid of it before I become the next soul to be taken by HIM.
