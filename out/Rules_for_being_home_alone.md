### Day 1

My parents just left about an hour ago, leaving me alone in this vast house. This isn't the first time I've been home alone, but this time feels different. The house seems quieter than usual, to the point that I can clearly hear the clock ticking from downstairs. Before they left, my mom handed me a piece of paper with very specific rules that, according to her, "must be strictly followed."

I unfolded the paper and read each line carefully.

1. **Do not open the door if someone knocks, even if it's someone you know.**
2. **Turn off all the lights before going to sleep.**
3. **Do not go outside after dark.**
4. **If you hear footsteps at night, hide immediately under the bed and make no noise.**
5. **Never look out the window at night.**

These rules are strange. Why did my mom carefully write these down? Usually, she doesn't need to remind me to be cautious like this. But I didn't want to disobey her, so I decided to adhere to them strictly.

That evening, as I was preparing for bed, I heard soft footsteps downstairs. The footsteps echoed through the hallway and then stopped right outside my room. My heart raced, and I held my breath, hiding under the bed as rule number 4 instructed. But then, nothing happened. The footsteps disappeared after a few minutes. Maybe I was just imagining things. Eventually, I was able to sleep, but my rest was fitful and uneasy.

### Day 2

Today, I decided to call my mom to ask about those strange rules, but she just told me not to worry and to remember to follow them. She also reminded me not to forget to turn off the lights before going to bed. Her voice sounded a bit urgent, which left me confused, but I didn't dare ask more.

The house was eerily quiet today. I felt as if I were being watched, but every time I looked around, there was no one there. That night, when I was about to go to sleep, I heard the footsteps again—this time clearer and closer. My heart thudded in my chest as I quickly crawled under the bed, clutching the blanket tightly, my eyes shut tight. The footsteps stopped right outside my room, but no one opened the door.

After a moment, I felt something brush against my leg. A chill ran down my spine, and I didn't dare open my eyes. But when I mustered the courage to look down, there was nothing there. The footsteps vanished as if they had never existed, but the sense of unease grew stronger.

### Day 3

I began to realize something was very wrong. This morning, as I went downstairs to prepare breakfast, I found the living room window wide open, even though I clearly remembered closing it last night. In fact, when I checked my own window, I saw faint fingerprints on the glass, as if someone had been standing outside, looking in.

The rules my mom left behind were no longer just instructions; they seemed to be the line between life and death. I decided to follow all the rules even more strictly. That evening, while sitting in my room, I heard soft breathing outside my door. I tried not to turn on the light, recalling rule number 2, and held my breath. The breathing was heavy, as if someone was standing right outside.

I didn't dare move. That entity was probably waiting for me to make a mistake. I crawled back under the bed, clutching the blanket. I could feel it was very close—too close. My heart raced so loudly that I feared it could hear me. Then, suddenly, I heard a knock on the door—this time it was the front door of the house.

### Day 4

Last night, I couldn't sleep at all. The knocking from downstairs persisted throughout the night. Every time it stopped, I would breathe a sigh of relief, but then it would start again, steady and rhythmic, as if someone were playing with me. I was sure it wasn't a normal person, but I couldn't do anything but adhere to the rules.

This morning, I tried calling my parents, but no one picked up. Worry grew stronger inside me. I wanted to leave this house immediately, but remembering rule number 3: "Do not go outside after dark," I told myself that if I could just survive tonight, my parents would be back. But as night fell, the house descended into terrifying silence.

I sat still in my room, staring at the door. The lights were off, the windows shut tight, but I couldn't calm myself. I heard footsteps in the hallway, clearer than ever. They approached closer, stopping right in front of my room. I held my breath, my heart pounding, but this time, I didn’t hide. I decided to confront it.

I walked slowly to the door, my hand trembling as it reached for the doorknob. But when I opened the door, there was no one there. Only a small piece of paper fell from above, with hasty, scrawled writing: "You have broken the rules."

### Day 5

I don't remember how I made it through last night. I only recall hiding under the staircase, trying to hold my breath and hoping that entity wouldn't find me. But I knew it was still here, and I couldn't hide forever.

My parents still hadn't returned. I didn't know what was happening outside, but I knew this house was no longer safe. I needed to escape before it came back. But before I could decide what to do, I heard footsteps... right behind me.

I turned around, but there was no one there. I hurriedly packed my things, determined to leave this house as soon as possible. But as I reached the front door, an unexpected chill washed over me. The door slammed shut, and all the lights in the house went out.

I was engulfed in darkness, and the heavy breathing echoed from somewhere. I struggled to open the door, but it was futile. The footsteps began again, this time faster, heavier. They approached closer and closer. I had no choice but to run upstairs, hide under the bed, and wait for something to happen.

In the darkness, I heard something scratching at my door, as if it wanted to come inside. I didn't dare move, only praying that it was all just a nightmare.

### Day 6

It was dusk when Ben's mother, Linda, finally returned home. She stepped inside, a sudden chill filling the space. Each of her footsteps echoed through the quiet house, and her calls for Ben echoed back with no response.

She ascended the stairs, her heart racing. The door to Ben's room was ajar, and the dim light from the hallway made her uneasy. When she pushed the door open, she found the room tidy, with no signs of disturbance. But strangely, on Ben's pillow lay a neatly placed piece of paper.

Linda picked up the note, her heart heavy as she read the hasty scrawled lines:

“Mom, I followed all the rules you set, but I feel something is wrong. There’s something in this house, and I can’t escape. If you’re reading this, I might not be here anymore. Please believe me, don’t stay in this house. It’s waiting... and it doesn’t want anyone to leave.”

A chill ran down her spine as she read those words. She couldn't understand why Ben felt that way. Just yesterday, she had promised him everything would be okay. In fact, the reason she left those rules wasn’t just to protect Ben from danger. Once, when she was young, she had lived in a similar house. She knew well the strange noises and the suffocating feeling of being alone. Those rules had helped her survive and not leave behind terrible memories.

She recalled the horrifying nights when she heard footsteps in the hallway, the knocks with no one there, and the feeling of always being watched. As she grew up, she vowed never to let that happen to Ben, no matter what.

“Ben! Where are you?” she shouted, her heart filled with worry. But only silence answered.

She decided to search the entire house. She went downstairs, feeling a weight on her chest. As she approached the front door, a noise from behind made her turn around. A small figure stood at the end of the hallway, its back to her.

“Ben?” she called softly, her voice trembling.

The figure didn’t respond. It stood silently, motionless. A wave of cold washed over her as she saw the figure slowly turn around. But strangely, it wasn’t Ben. The face of that figure was a dark void, featureless, just a deep, bottomless pit.

“Mom!” it exclaimed in Ben’s voice, but something was off. “You didn’t follow the rules... You shouldn’t be here!”

Linda felt fear engulf her. She turned to run, but the front door seemed locked tight. When she turned back, the figure was closer, its hands reaching out as if to pull her into the darkness.

“Don’t! I just want to help you!” she cried, tears streaming down her face.

“Help you?” The voice echoed, blending Ben’s and the shadow's. “You can’t help me... You can only follow.”

And then, a cold wind blew through, sweeping everything away. She felt her body being drawn into the darkness, unable to escape. That was the final moment...
