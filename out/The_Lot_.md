I had people ask me about the journal I found on my last journey. I had no intention of sharing its contents because it’s author was not worthy of The Lot. But seeing as no one has the courage to join me for my next voyage to the new world I shall share the writings. Maybe it will inspire someone else to seek the treasure waiting us. 

Here below is the contents of the book I obtained. 

I’ve never been much of a writer. Never been much of anything really, I lived my life one ordinary day at a time. 

I would say I was nearly an NPC. Weeks would go by without a change in my routine, I was living the life I thought I needed to. And it was a total waste, those dreams and ambitions are gone now. 

I should probably start at the beginning. Damn that sounds cliché but I’m writing in pen and I’m not going to scribble it out. You would think I would plan out what I’m going to write, but that’s just not how I do things so instead you get my ramblings. 

My name is Chuck, I’m a six foot one white guy who graduated middle of my class. I’ve been working a fairly dead end job as an online retailer for three years. 

That all changed when I found myself in this pocket dimension. At least that’s what I’m assuming it is, I have no idea as to what’s going on but alternate universe seems like as good an explanation as any. 

Like any other Tuesday or Thursday I was at the gym. When you sit for a living you have to keep moving in your off time. It was late, I had taken my sweet time showering. 

I would kill for a shower right now. 

So I walked out of the building, my mind on other things and I couldn’t seem to find my car. 

And it was dark, there wasn’t a single street light or building within sight. I reasoned that the power must be out, I kept clicking my key fob. 

My brain filled my ears with faint ringing in an attempt to comprehend the silence. Fear coursed through me, I knew something was horribly wrong. 

But when I turned to run back into the gym I found myself looking out over an endless expanse of metal humps. 

Every direction I turned showed more of the same. As animal instinct took over, I started to run. 

I ran and I ran, there was no end. It wasn’t long before I collapsed, it was both impossible and undeniable. I was no longer in Boulder. 

I screamed for help until my voice grew weak. I wandered back and forth looking for some glitch, some portal between worlds. 

The sun rose on the first day, it’s light revealing just how absolutely screwed I was. I couldn’t see an end, cars stretched on for dozens of miles. Rolling hills covered in black top and vehicles. 

The pattern was unbroken in every direction, an open lane, a car, a car and another open lane. No light poles, no flowerbeds. I almost felt dizzy, like my brain couldn’t comprehend the sheer vastness of this place. 

Despite it’s familiar appearance it felt wrong, twisted and distorted. This place wasn’t good, I wasn’t meant to be here. 

I had to shake away those thoughts on order to survive, if I focused on them I could imagine my body changing into something else. Something wrong. 

I reasoned that my best shot at escaping was to remain as close to the beginning as possible. If I had accidently entered perhaps I could accidentally exit. It was a flawed yet comforting logic. 

It only took a couple hours before I started to loot vehicles. After all, they were either not real, or the damage would lead to someone discovering me. 

I even tried to hotwire a dozen or so vehicles, but without Google I was just blindly connecting wires. Only one started but then I could steer it. So I burnt it and pissed on its corpse. 

I found myself growing accustom to the life of looting and vandalizing. There was this one time I had a chain reaction of burning cars get out of hand, but the fear made me feel alive again. 

After a week I had exhausted the resources in the area, I had to move on to fresh pastures. 

That’s when the first curve ball got me. After sleeping in a new area I remembered I had left a tool bag behind. I went to retrieve it but all the cars were in pristine condition. And they were different, my dozens of smashed and burnt cars were gone. Replaced by new vehicles
 
At the time I thought this meant infinite resources. It took a few more weeks for me to realize time moved forward. The cars didn’t spawn, not like I had thought. 

Rather than rendering as I moved forward they appeared to have already been here. But at the same time it was like things hadn’t started to age until I arrived. At first this didn’t bother me, but I soon realized this meant fresh food would soon be spoiled. 

I had found so many center consoles filled with rotten fruit but it took finding a moldy granola bar, my most common staple for me to worry about surviving. 

The fun had left once I thought about starving to death. I needed to get out. It had been over a month and nothing positive had happened. 

So I decided to push forward. I spent a long time figuring it out but I finally got an older GMC van to fire up. It took a ton of effort but I managed to break the steering lock. With all but the drivers seat removed I had plenty of room inside for supplies and sleeping. 

I barreled between the cars at a reckless speed. Quite often pushing 90mph, the little humps became ramps that would send me into the air for a brief second. 

I found myself thoroughly enjoying the drive. The near death moments just made me feel alive. That was until I clipped the back of a pickup that was poking out a little farther than expected.

The van spun with the impact and I felt myself leave the seat. Before I could react the van was flipping. At first sideways and then end over end. 

It happened so fast I didn’t have a chance to register what was happening. I found my self sitting on the asphalt bleeding from a dozen small cuts. My van lay on top of a 90’s Thunderbird it’s wheels still spinning. 

When the pain hit I knew what to do. No matter the distance traveled there was always a truck somewhere nearby that would undoubtedly have alcohol in it. 

This time was no different. It took a full case of shitty beer to numb my injuries but at last I was able sleep. 

I spent a good bit of time in that area. I hadn’t broken any bones but my entire body hurt. I took the time to carefully recover and to get in some exercise. 

The food situation was getting worse but it was not lethal yet. 

Two months into my journey I had visitors. I had strung my cobbled together hammock between two vehicles and was sleeping comfortably when something woke me. 

I lay still listening, my instincts told me I wasn’t alone. Sure enough I soon heard the slap of hard flesh on asphalt. 

Someone nearby was running barefoot. I sat up and came face to face with a grinning man. My eyes were drawn to his blackened teeth. Without warning he lunged forward. 

The hammock spun under our combined weight sending him over me. I had barely gotten my feet under me when he turned. His face now bloodied from its impact with the ground. 

He moved to grapple me but met my fist instead. I gasped in pain, I had never punched someone without gloves and head gear before. I should have held back a little. 

The blow knocked the crazed man onto the ground again. He was spitting blood and growling in an uncivilized manner. Rather than let him gain his footing I kicked the back of his head. 

And then I repeated that action until he lay still. 

Breathing heavily I leaned against the nearest car. I looked around me, my blood ran cold. 

There had to have been half a dozen people watching me. They were dirty, scarred and mostly nude. But most of all, they were hungry. 

I could see it in their eyes. I was nothing more than a Christmas ham to them. 

With their intent clear I slowly reached down, I managed to get my hand into my tool bag before the first pair sprinted towards me. 

They were so quiet, the only sound they made was slapping of feet and the grinding of teeth. 

My hand wrapped around the smooth handle of my 2.5 pound hammer. Taking a risk I grasped it firmly and pulled it from the bag. In a single movement I threw it at the nearest attacker. 

My throw was good, the hammer nearly disappeared into the man’s forehead and he dropped instantly. Before I could grab the next tool the second man was on me. 

I grabbed him and using his own momentum I tossed him over my hip into a nearby car. He struck it hard leaving a dent in the door. 

But unlike his companion he was back on his feet in a flash. I managed to drop an elbow through his collar bone as he grappled me. With his left arm limp it was easy break free. I kick to the chest sent him tumbling over a car. 

That was enough for him, he turned and ran into the night. 

I spun around in case the others had decided to attack but I was once again alone. Save for the two bodies that lay motionless. 

I grabbed my tool bag, retrieved my hammer and walked away. 

That attack changed things, I traveled by night more often. At least when I had flashlights to see with. Those people returned a few more times, each time I was able to fend them off with my homemade weapons. 

My walking stick now had a blade secured to the top. I also fashioned a short club and carried a knife in my belt. The weapons didn’t add much weight and were very effective on human flesh. 

But my attackers grew more cunning. I noticed a change after a week, they went from barely human savages to more stealthy people with some clothing. 

They died just as easily when their skulls were crushed but they didn’t blindly attack. Rather they ambushed, fought in groups and played tricks.  

One such trick nearly snaring me.

I was traveling during the day as I had exhausted my last flashlight. As the sun drew low I found myself settling for the bed of a pickup. It had grown cold but I still preferred sleeping outside. 

My eyes had just closed when something wet slapped against my face. Leaping to my feet with a club in one hand a knife in the other I looked around. I couldn’t see anyone in the dark. 

Something moist struck my back before falling into the bed of the truck with a plop. 

Seeing no one I reached down and retrieved the object. It was a bloody chunk of meat. No doubt I was covered in the thick pungent  juices. 

Then I saw it, a man stood to lob another chunk of flesh at me. I jumped from the truck, the man turned and fled. 

It did him no good, I had grown lean and hard during my time in this hell hole. No matter how desperately he weaved I gained on him. 

Once I had closed the gap I struck him between the shoulder blades. He fell to the ground and slid head first into a car. His body stopping with a crunch. 

They had ruined my clothes, I was irate. I screamed into the night. I felt hungry, yet I knew food wouldn’t satiate me. I hunted every flash of movement. I bashed, slashed and dismembered every one I came across. 

The rising sun found me out of breath and sporting a dozen cuts and bite marks. 

But never in all my life had I felt so alive. I was the ultimate predator, they had seen me as weak and vulnerable and it had cost them their lives. 

Unfortunately my success did not fix the problem of being absolutely filthy. If it wasn’t for cold temperatures I would have continued my journey nude.

Had I known why they had attacked me in the manner that they did I would have stripped despite the weather. 

I made it to mid day before my aggressors plan came to fruition. 

My guard was down, never had anyone come for me in the daylight. As I passed a tall truck the hairy head of a Doberman lunged out and sank its teeth into my calf. 

I cried out in pain, the dog twisted back and forth keeping me from regaining my bearings. Two more mutts came from opposite directions. 

The first to arrive received a knife in its face. It left quickly howling in agony. I barely had time to lift my arm as the second lashed out. It bit into my arm, the pain was excruciating but preferred to a neck wound. 

I was being pulled in two directions, each beast intent on getting its pound of flesh. 

I drove my thumb into the eye of the dog holding my arm. It cried out just enough for me to pull myself free, all the while the one using my leg as a chew toy pulled me further under the truck. 

My hand brushed the handle of my club, I gripped it tightly. Ignoring the ripping sensation in my leg I rolled over and brought the club down onto the skull of the dog that had attacked my arm. 

It crumpled to the ground and lay there twitching. 

Grabbing the step of the truck I pulled with such force the dog lost its grip on my leg. I managed to pull myself out from under the truck. 

The dog was quick to pursue, I swung my club but it struck the truck first and delivered only a glancing blow to the dog. In turn the dog managed to bite into the elbow of my good arm. 

My club fell to the ground as my arm spasmed. But I was not ready to die, not yet. 

I rolled onto the back of the dog, my arm pulling its head sideways as I did. The dumb beast wouldn’t let go and that gave me my opening. I sank my teeth into the dog’s throat. I pushed past the hair and bit through the tough skin. 

With a jerk of my neck I pulled a large piece of flesh free, hot sticky blood sprayed across my body. 

The dog released me and tried to run, a few yards away it collapsed and convulsed violently before laying still. 

I was bleeding badly from my leg, my arms were badly torn as well but the river of red coming from my leg was my greater concern. 

I took off my belt and using my club I made a tourniquet. The tightening of the tourniquet was the single most painful thing I had ever experienced. 

When the blood stopped flowing I fell to the ground. I feel no shame in saying I cried for a bit. 

But I didn’t have the time to lay there. I could hear growls of more canines approaching. 

Somehow I managed to get to my feet. I then climbed onto a van. I lay on the roof feeling weaker than I thought possible. 

Claws scratched on metal, I sat just in time to see a massive half starved Rottweiler leap from the hood of the van onto the roof. 

I kicked it off the roof. When I looked over the edge I saw at least a dozen dogs of various breeds all meandering about. They looked up at me drooling and whining. 

To them I was nothing more than a T bone steak. My weapons were mostly depleted, my strength fading. Even the sunlight was leaving me. 

To my surprise the lower the sun got the less dogs I saw. They milled about nervously, a few tried to get me only to be booted back. 

As the last rays of sunlight disappeared so did the dogs. But I was far from relieved. I doubted the dogs feared the wildmen. And they certainly didn’t fear me. 

What was coming with the darkness that would cause them to leave a meal?  

I didn’t stay long enough to find out. I slid off the van and hobbled as best I could. 

Perhaps an hour into my journey I heard the screeching of metal being ripped apart. I don’t know what had the strength to do such a thing but I do know I was in no condition to meet it. 

I made little progress that night, I count myself lucky nothing came out of the dark to attack me. I would have succumbed easily to anything. 

I can’t feel my leg, the vagueness is almost worse than the pain. My attempt at making crutches failed. I need something though, I won’t survive without mobility. 

Salvation comes in the form of a bike rack with a blue bike likely made for a middle school student hanging from it. 

Bikes are exceedingly rare, this is the second that I’ve seen in my trip through The Lot. 

Some time has passed, perhaps a week or more. Things got dire and a decision had to be made. 

My leg is gone. Cutting it off was easier than expected, sawing through the bone was time consuming but once achieved I was able to cauterize the stump. 

I fell into a state of depression after the loss of my limb. The very next night the wildmen came, they took my supplies but remained out of reach. 

I think they know I can’t pursue them any longer, but they still fear the consequences of getting within my reach. 

Progress is incredibly slow, I find that I am starving, I’m freezing, I might die here. 

The reality of that never struck me quite so hard, I don’t think I have the strength to go for much longer. 

I find that I’m ok with this, my life was that of someone going through the motions. I did what was expected and each day was like the last. But since coming here, since experiencing true freedom haltered only by my own limitations I finally felt alive. I felt like I was my own person. 

I made it farther than I thought I would have, I have been reduced to pulling myself along. Despite laying on frozen ground I do not feel cold. 

I know I have a fever, I know I am living my last couple days. I have no one to say goodbye to, and that’s ok. I’m ok with this. 

I seem to have found the end of the cars, there are more empty spaces than full. It is because of this that I spotted the shambler.

He has been ever so slowly following behind me, his pace only slightly faster than my own. 

I do not know if he is another lost soul like myself or a very persistent wildman. Perhaps he is something different all together, regardless of if he is my salvation, my doom or simply another human to sit beside as I die, he will reach me within the day. 

Consider this my last entry, unless I am carried from this world I will not leave it. I have positioned myself under a vehicle in order to shelter from the snow. I now wait for the stranger to come, I wait to discover my fate.
