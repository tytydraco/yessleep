My twin sister and I were twenty when this happened. All we had was our grandmother who was providing a roof over our heads and supporting us. Me and my sister used to be very close, but had since become more distant. 

Lately all she wanted to do was sit at the kitchen window staring at something outside. Soon she was staring for entire days at a time. I asked her what she was staring at and she said she'd only say if I guessed correctly.

"A house?"

"No."

"The sky?"

"No."

"The clouds?"

"No."

It went on like this for a while. Anything I could think of she said no to. She also refused to give any hints. Soon I had to get creative and ask about things that weren't there or at least that I couldn't see.

"A ghost?"

"No."

"An invisible alien?"

"No."

"An invisible fairy?"

"No."

I exhausted myself thinking of countless impossible things only to get the same tone less "No". I begged for hints but she wouldn't budge.

I realized that whatever was going on here just wasn't right. But she refused to stop staring at whatever it was. She had to be forced to take breaks but it was as if she didn't need to. 

I was spending hours up at night thinking of new things to ask her. But it was no use.

"Zombie pirates?"

"No."

"Ninjas?"

"No."

"Rainbow ponies?"

"No."


 Whatever she was staring at, just wasn't anything I could think of.

Finally I had an epiphany when coming up with creative guesses. It was a disturbing one. Too disturbing. But something told me I needed to guess this. This horrible thing. I didn't want to guess this. But I felt compelled. Something told me it was the answer.

"Sister," I anxiously began. It got her attention.

"What is it?"

"Is the thing you are looking at just the sky but you cannot tell me because if you do the world will end?"

She turned her gaze away from the sky and began to stare at me. This was something she never did even with the dumbest of guesses.

Rather than say anything, she slowly transformed. She grew tentacles, claws, and fangs. He flesh distorted into something monstrous. She was an eldritch abomination. I couldn't believe my eyes. But this was reality. This is what she was hiding. The world really was coming to an end or so it seemed.

 Before I knew it she started to chase me. I ran out of the house as quickly as I could. I ran far down the street and around blocks. Hoping she wouldn't catch up with me.

But it was no use.

Now the world hasn't ended quite yet, but like her I know things No human should know. We spend most of our time staring at something we refuse to confirm, waiting for the next person to question us. 

Why am I even sharing this story?

Because it is getting quite boring waiting for the world to end just the two of us.
