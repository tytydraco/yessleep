After the knife incident, I couldn’t sleep.

Not in the bedroom. Not in the guest room. Not even downstairs on the couch. I kept telling myself I’d hallucinated the whole thing. Maybe my mind was frayed from all the stress, the long nights, the paranoia building like steam in a kettle. But no amount of reasoning could undo what I’d seen—that knife, sticking straight out of our wedding photo like it had been stabbed into flesh, the word *cozy* etched into the handle with something sharp and angry.

I tried sleeping on the couch, but I kept glancing at the pile next to the recliner. It wasn’t just laundry anymore. It wasn’t just old blankets and coats. It was...shaped. Intentional. Not quite a nest, but something close to it. The blankets were arranged like bedding, with a shallow dip in the center where I knew she’d curled up. A pillow had been dragged into the fold, and a damp towel crumpled at the edges like she’d chewed on it or held it to her mouth. The whole thing reeked of sweat and something faintly sour. Like she’d been in there for hours days.

I sat on the couch until dawn, legs pulled up, hugging my knees like a little kid waiting for a storm to pass.

She came down around seven.

Still in her t-shirt and sleep shorts. Hair wild. Eyes puffy. No trace of a smile. She looked, for a moment, like the Audrey I used to know. Tired. Soft. Sleepy. But she didn’t say good morning. Didn’t even look at me. Just walked into the kitchen like nothing had happened.

I followed.

“I want to talk about the piles,” I said.

She stood at the sink, back to me, filling the kettle with water like she hadn’t heard. But I knew she had.

“The piles are getting out of hand,” I continued. “And they’re creeping me out.”

She set the kettle down harder than she meant to. It clanged against the burner.

“You used to be neat,” I said. “You used to hate clutter. Remember that?”

Audrey turned around slowly. Her expression was blank—calm, but too calm. Her lips parted slightly, then pressed together again.

I waited.

“I’m just comfortable,” she said.

“Comfortable?” I echoed. “With…what? Building these things all over the house?”

She blinked. Once. Slowly.

“They’re not *things*. They help me feel cozy.”

That word again.

Cozy.

I didn’t yell. I didn’t scream. I wanted to, but I didn’t. I just looked at her.

She finally met my eyes.

“I’ll tidy them up,” she said, voice flat. “If they bother you.”

That was it. No apology. No promise.

I stared at her for a long time. I wanted to ask what was wrong. I wanted to ask why our wedding photo was full of stab holes.

But I didn’t ask any of it.

I just nodded and walked back into the living room.

The pile by the recliner was still there. I could feel it, like a presence — not watching exactly, but aware. I didn’t touch it. I didn’t look at it.

I left for work like usual, locking the door behind me and trying not to think about the photo. Or the knife. Or the smell that had started to cling to my clothes.

I spent the whole day on edge. My phone buzzed once around 2 p.m. — a text from Audrey. Just a heart emoji. No words.

I stared at it for a long time before locking my phone again.

When I got home that night, the air in the house was heavier than usual. Warmer. The kind of heat that lives under blankets, close and damp. I loosened my tie and called out, “Hey, I’m home.”

No answer.

The lights were off in the living room. The piles were still there, unmoved but… fuller. It was hard to explain. The house felt denser. Like it had grown inward.

I walked toward the kitchen to put down my keys.

That’s when I saw it.

There was a new pile. Right in the center of the kitchen floor.

It hadn’t been there that morning.

It wasn’t small. Not like the others when they started. This one had skipped the early stages. It was full-grown, wide and high, blocking half the room. A stack of comforters, bathrobes, winter coats. A ring of shoes circled the base like teeth. Dishes were wedged into the folds — bowls, mugs, a single wineglass filled with something dark.

I took one slow step forward.

“Audrey?” I said.

The pile twitched.

Before I could move, something grabbed my ankle.

Hard.

I stumbled, catching myself on the edge of the counter. My foot was yanked backward, dragging me toward the pile. I kicked, hard, connecting with something soft but solid. It didn’t let go.

Another hand grabbed my wrist.

I screamed.

Not a loud scream. Not a heroic one. Just a dry, choking sound. My head hit the edge of a cabinet and stars burst behind my eyes. I twisted, flailing, trying to see what had me — and that’s when I saw her.

Audrey.

Her face emerged from the layers. Just her face. The rest of her was still buried. Her eyes were wide and bloodshot. Her mouth was smiling. Not her normal smile. Not even the fake one.

This smile was hungry.

She opened her mouth, and I heard her whisper, “It’s okay. It’s just cozy. We’ll be cozy forever.”

I screamed again and tore myself free.

I didn’t feel the pain until later. My ankle was bleeding, and there were bruises blooming on my arm where her fingers had locked around me like a clamp. I didn’t stop to look. I didn’t stop at all.

I ran.

Out the front door, down the steps, across the yard. I didn’t grab my briefcase. I didn’t grab my wallet. I didn’t care.

I drove to Dave’s house with one shoe on and a coat over my work clothes. I almost crashed pulling out of the driveway.

When I got there, I rang the bell twice before he answered.

He took one look at me and said, “Dude. What happened?”

I couldn’t answer.

Dave hadn’t changed much since high school.  
Same ponytail. Same oversized hoodie. Same weed smell clinging to the seams of his flannel couch.

He let me in without asking questions, then handed me a beer and sat cross-legged on the floor like we were seventeen again.

“I mean, dude,” he said after I finally managed to tell him what happened. “You’re not sleepwalking or something, right?”

I shook my head. “No.”

“Hallucinating?”

“No.”

“Off your meds?”

“I’m not on any.”

He took a swig and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Then she’s messing with you, man. Like, full-on psych trickery.

I didn’t laugh.

He blinked at me. “Sorry.”

We sat in silence for a while. Some movie was playing on mute behind us — explosions and gunfire flashing across the screen. He muted it entirely and turned to face me.

“What do you know about her?” he asked.

I looked at him. “What do you mean?”

“I mean background. Childhood. Parents. Trauma. All that Lifetime movie stuff.”

“She said she was homeschooled,” I said. “She told me her parents were kind of off-the-grid. I never met them. She said they died in a car accident when she was sixteen.”

Dave raised an eyebrow. “You sure about that?”

“That’s what she told me.”

He pulled his laptop onto his knees, flipped it open, and started typing with fingers that were still smudged with Dorito dust. “Name?”

“Audrey Carrigan. Before we got married it was Audrey Bishop.”

Clicking. Tapping. Scrolling.

Then he frowned.

“Dude.”

He turned the screen toward me.

It was an old local news article from Oregon. The headline read: *Girl, 8, Found Alone in Forest Nest — Parents Still Missing.* The picture was grainy, but the face was unmistakable.

It was Audrey.

The article was from twenty years ago.

I leaned in, heart pounding.

“Eight-year-old Audrey Bishop was found Wednesday afternoon in the Willamette National Forest after a hiker reported hearing a child’s laughter coming from inside a brush pile. Authorities located the girl at the base of a Douglas fir tree, partially buried beneath leaves and twigs. Medical responders described her as ‘physically unharmed but psychologically distant.’ She was taken into protective custody. Her parents, Joel and Anne Bishop, have not been found.”

The rest of the article was mostly about the search effort. Helicopters. Volunteers. Sniffer dogs. They never found the parents. They never figured out what happened. The girl wouldn’t talk.

I leaned back, lightheaded.

Dave whistled. “Okay. Okay. That’s not nothing.”

“She never told me any of this.”

He shrugged. “Would you?”

My hands were slick with sweat.

Dave kept scrolling. “She was in the foster system for a while. Bounced around. Got adopted at eleven by some older couple in Medford. Then poof—straight A’s, debate team, college.”

“She never told me,” I said again.

“She wouldn’t,” Dave said. “She’s probably spent half her life pretending it never happened.”

Dave reached for a blunt on the coffee table, lit it, and took a long drag before handing it to me.

I didn’t smoke.

I held it anyway.

We didn’t speak for a long time.

Then Dave said, “We should go back.”

I didn’t answer.

“We’ll just check things out. Get some answers. Bring a flashlight. Maybe a priest.”

I stared at the laptop screen again — that photo of Audrey in the woods, smiling faintly.

There was something wrong with that smile.

I didn’t sleep much at Dave’s place. I lay on his couch all night with my eyes open, listening to the low hum of his mini fridge and the occasional cough from his bedroom down the hall.

His apartment smelled like old incense, spilled beer and weed. The couch cushions were too soft, and everything I touched felt slightly damp.

But I didn’t mind. I didn’t care. I just needed to be away from the house.

I kept seeing her face in the pile — the way she’d smiled as she grabbed my ankle, the whisper echoing through the folds of fabric.

*Cozy forever.*

I tried turning on the TV to drown it out. Late-night cartoons. Some sitcom rerun with the volume low. Nothing worked. Every creak from the pipes sounded like something crawling under blankets.

Around five in the morning I gave up on sleeping entirely.

Dave shuffled out around seven, still in the same pajama pants and a stretched-out T-shirt with a mushroom graphic on the front. He rubbed his eyes, blinked at me, and yawned so wide I could see the filling in his back molar.

“You look worse,” he said.

“I didn’t sleep.”

He scratched his stomach. “Well… that’s fair.”

We sat in silence for a few minutes, me staring at his fish tank, him trying to roll a joint with hands that clearly weren’t awake yet. The fish were all huddled in one corner, barely moving.

“I still think we should go,” he said finally. “You need to know what’s going on.”

I nodded.

He clapped his hands and stood. “But first — McMuffin run.”

I frowned. “What?”

“Dude. I don’t do crazy before breakfast.”

I grabbed my keys.

Outside, the sky was that dull gray that happens right before full daylight. Everything looked colorless. The streets were mostly empty. My windshield was speckled with dead leaves and streaks of pollen. I didn’t clean it.

Dave climbed into the passenger seat, holding a wrinkled five-dollar bill. “Hash browns or bust.”

The drive-thru line was longer than expected. A minivan full of screaming kids. A couple in matching tracksuits. Dave drummed his fingers on the dashboard, humming along to some lo-fi beat from his phone.

“You want a sandwich?” he asked.

“I don’t care.”

He ordered three of them and two coffees. The kid at the window looked like he’d just finished crying.

As we pulled into the exit lane, Dave handed me a steaming paper bag and said, “Eat. You’ll need the energy in case we have to fight off, like, Momma Sasquatch or something.”

I didn’t laugh. I didn’t even look at him.

I kept my eyes on the road, letting the car idle a little too fast at every light.

The coffee burned my tongue.

The closer we got to the house, the more I felt it. That pressure behind the ribs. That sense of crossing into somewhere you’re not supposed to return to.

Dave tried to talk — nonsense mostly. Story about a guy he knew who once lived with a woman who talked to her shoes. Something about his car’s timing belt. I barely heard any of it.

When we turned onto my street, the house came into view like a wound.

It looked the same. On the outside, at least. Lawn uncut. Curtains drawn. Audrey’s car still in the driveway.

But I felt it in my gut. Something was different.

I parked at the curb and turned off the engine.

Dave leaned forward, sipping his coffee like it was just another Tuesday.

“Well,” he said, licking a smear of egg off his thumb. “Here we are.”

I didn’t move.

The house didn’t either.

It just sat there, still and quiet, holding its breath.

I unlocked the front door, and we stepped inside.

The first thing I noticed was the smell.

It had changed.

It wasn’t just dust and fabric and damp anymore. It was stronger. Musky. Almost sweet. Like rotting fruit left too long in a warm room. Dave covered his nose with his sleeve and muttered something under his breath.

The second thing I noticed was the quiet.

It was waiting.

I stood there in the entryway for a long time, letting my eyes adjust. The light from the open door barely reached the living room. Everything was in shadow. The piles were taller now. Thicker. They’d grown in the day I’d been gone. Spread out like moss.

Dave stepped forward.

“Dude,” he whispered. “This is next-level hoarder sh—”

“Don’t touch anything,” I said.

He stopped.

We moved through the living room slowly, careful where we stepped. The floor was no longer visible in places. Whole clusters of objects had formed barriers — stacks of pillows, chair cushions, folded clothes, and heaps of what looked like winter coats. Lamps without bulbs. A pile of hairbrushes, all tangled with strands. I saw my hoodie from college halfway up one mound, sleeves tied like arms folded in prayer.

It wasn’t random.

There was symmetry now.

The piles weren’t just gathered — they were built.

And then the sounds started.

Small. Barely audible.

A faint creak from upstairs.

Dave looked at me.

“I thought you said she wasn’t here.”

“She shouldn’t be.”

We both turned toward the staircase.

The pile at the base of the stairs had doubled in size. Books and cushions. Throw blankets. Pieces of old Halloween costumes. It blocked part of the bottom step. Something had been dragged across it — long grooves in the fabric like claw marks or fingers.

I felt sick.

“Where’s the big one?” Dave asked.

I knew what he meant — the kitchen pile. The one that grabbed me.

We made our way in slowly.

When I saw it, I stopped.

It was in the same spot — center of the kitchen floor — but the shape was different. Wider. Lower to the ground, like it had melted and reformed. The wine glass was gone. In its place was a plastic bowl filled with water. Floating inside: one of my socks.

Dave stared.

“Dude. What the hell is she *doing*?”

I didn’t answer.

Dave walked closer.

“Don’t,” I said.

We stared at the pile together.

Something shifted inside it.

Dave whispered, “Oh no.”

Then a hand came out.

It slid from the tunnel slowly, fingers first. Pale. Wrinkled. Caked with lint and dust. Then another hand, grasping the edge of the pile like it was climbing down from a ledge.

And then Audrey.

Her face emerged from the dark, eyes wide and glassy, lips curved in that same stretched smile. Hair clung to her skin like wet threads. She blinked once, then tilted her head.

“Hi,” she said softly.

I couldn’t move.

Her voice was wrong—too calm, too sweet. It sounded like it came from inside the walls.

“You came back,” she said. “I knew you would.”

Dave whispered, “We should go.”

She heard him.

Her head turned sharply toward him, joints clicking. The smile stayed, but her mouth opened wider.

“You shouldn’t have brought him,” she said.

She started crawling out.

Not walking. Crawling. Her arms bent wrong, elbows high, legs dragging behind her. The fabric clung to her like webbing as she crawled towards us.

Dave backed away. “Nope. No. No, dude.”

I grabbed his sleeve. “Run.”

Then she lunged.

I pulled Dave backward, but she grabbed his hoodie, clawed at it, dragged him down with her into the pile. They collapsed in a heap of old laundry and cereal boxes. Dave was flailing, arms windmilling.

“Man down,” he shrieked.

I dove in after him.

I shoved aside magazines, ripped a towel off Dave’s head, grabbed his arm and yanked him up just as Audrey tried to climb over both of us.

Her nails scraped my neck.

“You’re not leaving,” she said. “You don’t get to leave *again.*”

I shoved her. Hard.

She went back into the pile with a thud.

Dave yelled, “YOU MARRIED A SASQUATCH,” as we bolted out of the room.

She came after us.

Running now. Screaming nonsense. Her arms windmilling like a kid having a tantrum.

I grabbed the front door handle. Locked.

She’d bolted it.

We ran to the kitchen. Dave slipped on a floor mat and took out a folding chair with him, but I hauled him up and kicked the back door open so hard the screen popped off.

We hit the backyard and didn’t stop running until we were two blocks away.

We stayed at Dave’s apartment for two nights.

He gave me the futon. Said I could crash there as long as I needed, but made it very clear he’d sleep with one eye open if I brought any “blanket-loving goblins” back with me.

He tried to make jokes. He always did when things got weird. But even Dave couldn’t joke the darkness away. Not this time.

I called Audrey’s sister. Left a message. Told her Audrey was in a bad state. That I’d be moving out and she might need help. I didn’t go into details. How do you explain to someone that their sister was living inside a Yeti nest, carving up wedding photos and whispering about being “cozy forever”?

I didn’t know what to say.

She never called back.

The third day, I told Dave I needed to go back.

“Bro,” he said, “this is how horror sequels happen.”

“I’m not going back to stay,” I said. “I just need to see if she’s okay. One last time.”

He sighed. Then handed me pepper spray, a vape pen, and a granola bar.

“Godspeed,” he said.

When I got to the house, the porch light was on.

It was noon.

The lock was undone.

The door creaked open with barely a touch.

I stepped inside.

And the first thing I noticed was the quiet.

Not just silence — absence.

No humming. No breathing. No Audrey.

I walked through the house slowly.

Stepped over broken frames, moldy towels, half-buried shoes.

No sign of her.

In the kitchen, the big pile had collapsed completely. A pile of spoons and teacups spilled across the linoleum. The sink was running — a low, steady stream.

She wasn’t in the bedroom. Or the closet. Or the pile under the stairs.

I stood there, staring at the ruin of my home, wondering if she was gone. Maybe she’d left on foot, wandered off the way she came. Back to the woods. Back to the nest where they found her.

I turned to leave.

And then I heard the sound.

From upstairs.

Then another.

Slow. Rhythmic. Like something bumping against drywall.

I froze.

It was coming from the attic.

I almost left right then. I should have.

But something in me said I had to look.

I climbed the stairs slowly. Avoided the step that always creaked. The hallway was full of shadows. The attic door was open — the ladder already down.

I climbed.

The air up there was thick. Still warm. The dust clung to my lungs.

It was almost pitch black, except for a narrow beam of light cutting through a crack in the roof.

It shone directly onto one final pile.

No bigger than a laundry basket.

It was made of old sweaters. My sweaters. And inside it, pressed into the center like the yolk of an egg, was a human shape.

Not moving.

Not breathing.

Just… curled.

Arms wrapped around knees. Head down. Face turned away.

The light caught her hair.

It was Audrey.

She’d built one last nest.

I didn’t speak. I didn’t move. I couldn’t.

After a long minute, I backed down the ladder.

Quiet.

Slow.

I left the house and never went back.

I don’t know how long she stayed there.

I don’t want to know.

But sometimes, at night, I wake up with the blankets too close around me. I feel the weight of them on my chest. Smell something warm and damp. Hear her voice in my ear.

**You ruined it.**

**We were almost cozy.**
