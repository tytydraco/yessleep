I was pacing around. The room had taken on a sinister air. The idea that someone could have entered while we slept, watched us in total silence, without us noticing, chilled me to the bone. I paced back and forth, wearing down the floor beneath my feet. Mia was still unconscious, and I didn't know what to do anymore. Walking was all that kept me from collapsing, or from curling up in a corner like a coward. I replayed the events endlessly in my head: the blood, everywhere, in the hallway on our floor, on the first floor too… then nothing. The wasted time. And above all, her. That woman. She was taking over my thoughts, more and more. I knew it, I felt it: she was haunting me. I was alone with my thoughts, no one to talk to. This solitude was unbearable. Madness took hold of my mind and I began to talk to myself, a whole monologue, asking and answering my own questions.

\-  “What are you doing? Or rather, what are you not doing?”

\- Why don't you leave? Why don't you take Mia with you and leave? What's stopping you? 

\-I don't know, I don't know, I... I hadn't thought about leaving yet... but I don't want to, no, I don't want to... I haven't proven myself yet, haven't found it yet. 

\- Proven? Found? That's what you keep thinking about, over and over again. But why? And why don't you call for help? Your phone works! It was a battle in my mind between madness and reason, but there was more to it than that, I felt it, something here was acting on me.

\- “Call who? I don't want to talk to anyone. They can't do anything, I don't want to see them. They won't understand.” 

\- Understand what? I can't say it, I don't want to talk about it, I feel so humiliated. 

\- You're going crazy, you're becoming stupid, you're doing whatever you want. You've lost all sense of reason.

\- "I know! I know! I KNOW!!...”

 I screamed louder and louder. I slapped myself, again and again, a searing pain gripping me. Anger was overcoming fear. I no longer wanted to lose myself in my thoughts, nor drown in unanswered questions. I wanted to act; I refused to be a man who did nothing, who hid, who cried and screamed. I didn't want to be even more useless than I had been in my life. Anger rose within me, turning into fury; I could feel the blood pounding in my temples, it was unbearable. A storm raged inside me. Without thinking, I grabbed Mia's bedside table and hurled it with all my might against the mirror. A hole opened, cracks ran in every direction, dropping fine shards of glass like sparkling rain. Then the larger pieces began to fall, gradually revealing that there was something behind the mirror. I approached, breathless, and began to tear away the debris myself, cutting my fingers without even realizing it.

 There was no wall behind the mirror, just a transparent pane of glass. I found myself face to face with a being who looked me straight in the eyes, unresponsive to what had just happened. He was smiling, an enormous, wide smile that stretched from ear to ear; his teeth were extremely large, flawless, and straight. His head was abnormally round, too large; he wasn't human. Those round eyes didn't blink and stared at me. I jumped back. Only those black, empty pupils followed me; nothing else about him moved. I began pounding on the glass with my fists, screaming. The blood from my cuts left viscous streaks on the transparent surface.

\- “What are you? What do you want from us?”

 The thing didn't react; its arms remained inert at its sides. I continued to bang on the glass, which didn't budge. Finally, it straightened mechanically, stiff as a board. Then it turned toward the exit of the room it was in, its dark eyes fixed on mine, its smile slowly fading. Its face was like a grotesque mask, incapable of any other expression. It looked at me sideways, its eyes bulging. Its gaze chilled me to the bone. It took a step forward and opened the door in front of it. I realized then that it was in the room marked with a small yellow lightning bolt in the corridor, the one we had mistaken for an electrical room. It wasn't just this revelation that made me move, but also the realization that it had vanished down the corridor. I rushed outside, ready to chase it and tackle it to the ground. I opened the door so violently that it bounced off the wall. I found myself in the deserted corridor, with no trace of him. Nothing, nobody. I ran as fast as I could, going around in circles, hoping to catch him.  He couldn't have disappeared. But nothing. It drove me absolutely crazy. I'd missed him, I hadn't managed to catch him. Damn, I felt so frustrated and terrified. I was out of control; all sense of calm had vanished. I started pounding on every door, trying to force it open—the bedroom doors, the doors to the supply rooms supposedly for the staff. I screamed insults indiscriminately, completely unable to control myself, smearing blood on everything I touched, even the walls and the floor. The harder I pounded, the more the wounds on my hands opened and oozed, but I felt nothing.

My psychological suffering and emotional state were so chaotic that I felt nothing physically. Of course, no one reacted. Even the potential occupants of the rooms I was violently ransacking didn't come out; the corridor remained desperately empty, and the only sound was my scream of rage. I tried to enter the room with the yellow flash, where the creature had observed me earlier, but it was locked. I pulled on the handle, twisted it this way and that, and kicked the door. It wouldn't open.

 Nothing made sense, I understood nothing. After my pointless outburst had finally subsided, I went to find Mia, whom I'd left alone. I found myself facing a closed, locked door, impossible to open. I hadn't locked it before going on my rampage through the entire floor. I tried to force the door open several times, but I couldn't. I banged on it, yelling. "Mia! Open up! Mia, wake up, I'm stuck outside!" No response, no sound from the room. I was helpless, humiliated. I made a fool of myself struggling with those damn doors.

 What man isn't strong enough to break down a fucking bedroom door! I finally collapsed to the floor, my back against the door. My resolve shattered, my anger exhausted. My last hope, my cell phone in my pocket, I reached for it to try and call Mia, and that's when I saw it was 12:05 AM. The rules said not to leave the room after midnight, and I was stuck there.

 A ton of questions started flooding my mind again. Was I in danger?Should I continue searching?  Was Mia still in the room? Was she alone? Where else could she have been taken?“I shouldn’t have left her alone, I shouldn’t have left. Shit, damn it, I’m… as always, really too stupid.” I wondered if the room door locked automatically at midnight. We hadn't tried opening it at that time the previous night. But if that was the case, it also meant that only hotel staff could enter at night, but we couldn't leave. We had never felt safe. My fists were in a terrible state, my lungs burning with every breath after my intense, frantic efforts. Pain was my only presence at that moment; I hadn't felt it until then, and it had returned with a vengeance, keeping me company, keeping me awake and alert. I was torn between letting go, waiting to see what would happen, or getting up and looking for Mia, for answers, and continuing to break the rules. Aside from my life, what did I have to lose? I couldn't hide anywhere, and if Mia wasn't in the room anymore, maybe I should check if she was somewhere else; I had no idea. I thought about it as much as I could, and I made up my mind. The woman in white wanted me to come to her; she would surely have answers, so I was going to find her in this hell.

 \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To begin with, I decided to go down to the first floor.. When Mia and I were there earlier, there was blood in the hallway, coming from a room at the end. I got to my feet and summoned what little courage and anger I had left to go down the stairs. I pushed open the door to the floor and found it clean and tidy. No longer even surprised by these abominations, I crossed the threshold and walked purposefully to the door of the room I had spotted a few hours earlier. Having arrived at my destination, my hand was trembling. I placed my other hand on top of the first; I couldn't hesitate, not now. It was too late, I was trapped, I had to try to get some answers. I gripped the handle firmly, the metal cool against my palm. When I turned it, the door opened. I paused, surprised. I was sure I'd found myself in at another dead end. Of course, I'd hoped to be able to get in when I decided to come here, but until now, everything had always been locked.

 I gently pushed the door open with my fingertips. Discretion was key; I needed to calm down and stop acting like a mindless savage. Behind the door, an empty, white vestibule led to another door. I went in, glancing behind me for fear the front door would close on me, but it didn't move. I strained my ears; sounds were reaching me from the other side of the inner door. I couldn't hear anyone speaking, but I could hear someone moving, perhaps even more than one person. The scrape of furniture sliding across the floor, rustling sounds, the clatter of objects being set down. I moved closer, and my foot made a soft squeaking noise as it slid across the white tiles. They were damp; they had just been washed. The sounds in the room had stopped abruptly. So much for discretion. After a few seconds of silence, a commotion erupted, the sound of quick footsteps echoing around the room. I flung open the door; I didn't want anyone to be able to escape or catch me by surprise again. The large, spacious, luxurious, immaculate room immediately caught my eye. Everything was made of marble and furnished with high-quality pieces; white was the dominant color here as well. The entire room smelled of fresh paint. On the other side of the room, another door was closing, and in the doorway I glimpsed the same bulging eyes and that smile I'll never forget. He was staring at me. A small, provocative, sinister laugh assaulted my ears. He was openly mocking me. I ran and crossed the room in two strides, but it was too late; the door locked right in front of me. I couldn't follow him. I pulled on it like a madman, the knuckles of my raw hands turning white, but I couldn't even make it budge. That door that led straight into the mountain. That passage that shouldn't even exist. I failed to reach it again; I lost to a door again. 

I will hate doors forever! I was disoriented, everything was crazy, and getting crazier and crazier. The room had no windows, contrary to what we had imagined; natural light came from the ceiling lights. What was confusing was thinking about this passage through the mountain, but why? What was under the mountain?

 Too many questions, no answers; thinking was pointless. I had to just do what I could control. Search, try, and see what happened. I continued to observe the room for a moment. The floor was damp, just like in the vestibule, and the smell of paint was everywhere. It had just been cleaned, even repainted! I couldn't imagine what could have happened here for so much blood to end up splattered in the upstairs hallway, forcing them to repaint the walls of this room. I thought back to the state the Lady in White was in when I last saw her, covered in blood, completely dripping. Whatever had happened here, it had to be her, and it had been violent. What kind of thing is she?

 I no longer knew what to think, and I was alone, the only one who could think, alone, the only one searching. I didn't know if I could trust myself or with what I had seen. Perhaps when I thought I was dying, when I felt the dagger in my heart, I was dead. Perhaps now I am in hell, trapped here in this hotel with creatures I know nothing about. Despair began to overwhelm me, accompanied by the pain that had never left me; they formed a particularly effective duo for torturing me. I would never go home, I could feel it. The hotel was going to keep me. She was going to keep me, this woman who wanted me. Was she going to devour me? Reduce me to pulp and leave me sprawled in the hallway too? That was the punishment for my arrogance. I was sure I had nothing left to lose, because I had already lost. The rules were useless to me now. Since our arrival, my way of thinking, my ego, and my narrow-mindedness had taken more than one a hit, and everything that made me who I was had been trampled underfoot. Now I no longer knew who I was. Resigned, I decided I would go see what the basement might be hiding. I no longer had any sense of safety; I didn't care about anything. 

 \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 I took the elevator and pressed the -1 button without hesitation. I preferred to start there, and depending on what I discovered, I would go deeper. The elevator began to descend, and I could feel its jolts beneath my feet, the vibrations of the mechanisms that powered it. When you stop thinking about a multitude of things, you become aware of {THE} small, ever-present details you hadn't noticed before. The elevator creaked slightly, and the lower it descended, the louder the creaking became. The arrival underground must have been the cause of this more intense resonance. Strangely, I wasn't afraid; I went on, following the path laid out before me, ready to accept whatever I saw. When the elevator stopped with a slight, unsettling jolt, there was no "DING." The doors simply opened, scraping and forcing their old gears to work. It was dark; everything before me was in darkness, the only source of light being the flickering elevator light. I couldn't see anything in front of me, but I moved forward. One step after another, I walked toward into the darkness. The sound of my footsteps on the rocky ground echoed as if in a cave, bouncing off the surrounding walls. The smell of dust and damp enveloped me, the chill biting into every inch of my skin, and in the complete darkness, I imagined what kind of place I might be in. The echo of my footsteps was not the only sound I heard; my hearing sharpened and became more attentive as I advanced into this seemingly infinite place. Breaths, faint and deep, slight movements, rustling sounds. In this darkness, I wasn't alone. He was there too. I heard his laughter again, high-pitched and mocking, then others like it rose up to join in. Dozens of terrifying laughs resonated around me in the blackness. 

 Not knowing where to go, I continued on my way, my hands outstretched in front of me to spot obstacles and dangers. I bumped into a hard, metallic object. Running my hands over it, I felt it was cube-shaped, made of icy metal bars. A cage. I ran my fingers along the bars, down to the floor, and crouched beside it. A pungent, unpleasant smell, one I hadn't noticed before, hit me. Just as I was about to stand up, my heart skipped a beat when something in the cage grabbed my hand. I jumped violently. I felt rough skin, the dried earth clinging to it. Was it human? Or one of those things I'd glimpsed? I took its hand in mine; it was frail, cold, and thin. I was about to break the silence to try and speak to the person I was touching.

 When the ceiling lights came on, one by one, in a synchronized series of loud bangs like a corporate warehouse. The light blinded me at first, but quickly my vision improved, and around me were hundreds of cages, filled with women, men, and children, weakened, apathetic, surely drugged, malnourished, and dehydrated. The floor was just as I'd imagined it, dusty packed earth, the walls carved into the rock. I was in a cave, inside the mountain with all these poor people. I looked to see who was holding my hand; I'd almost forgotten, the grip was so weak. It was the woman from the video, the one who, with her partner, owned the van that had been found. The one because of whom Mia and I had dared to come and see what was happening here. Looking all around me, I couldn't grasp the magnitude of what I was seeing; I couldn't react. How could I react to this? Hidden in the dark depths of the cave, dozens of large, bulging eyes, now familiar to me, shone brightly in the darkness. They didn't move, watching me as always.

\- “Why don’t you come and kill me!?” I screamed.

 No, I didn't intend to try to save anyone. I know I couldn't have done it; I'm not a hero, I'm selfish, cowardly, and stupid, empty and alone. I was just waiting for the end. I didn't have all the answers yet, but what I had seen and experienced was enough for me to understand that I was wrong. There's nothing normal, fake, or contrived here. Nothing is what I had bet on. I couldn't see Mia from where I was; I didn't know if she was somewhere here or simply safe in her room all along. These beings with their heads far too large and round, their teeth far too square and wide, their mouths far too smiley, will eventually stop toying with my fear by silently watching me. They'll devour me or lock me in one of those cages, like an animal, and I'll know nothing of what happened to Mia. I let go of the woman's hand; I didn't even ask her any questions. Did I really want to know what was happening here? Were the details before dying really important? I didn't care, not at that moment.

 The heavy clatter of heels on the floor filled the room, and I could feel the earth beneath me tremble with each step. Before I even turned around, I knew who it was. I recognized her rhythm, I felt her presence. She had finally come for me. Or rather, I had finally found her, and come to her as she had asked. I am a foolish lamb who walked straight into the lion's den, because she asked me to. I know that's what she wanted.

 She planted herself in front of me, and I realized how tall she was, taller than me; I think she must have been close to two meters. She smiled at me, again. Here I was, at her mercy, and I didn't want to run away.
