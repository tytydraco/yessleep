I found a scrap of paper in Wes's room. That's where I'm sitting right now, at his desk. The paper says 'How to tell the imposters: 1. Creepy smile 2. Weird behavior. They change depending on who they're talking to. 3. They use' That's all it says. Something- or someone tore off the rest. Maybe even him. I don't know.

A lot has happened in the past few hours. Not so much, I would say as yesterday, but it feels like a lot. I'm exhausted. I was sitting up all night, terrified that whatever got Beck would get me. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw his pale face, floating in whatever that liquid was. The one or two times I drifted off, I'd wake up a few minutes later, my leg burning in pain.

This morning I went outside to start walking to school. As I walked by Wes’s house, he sprinted out of the door. 

“Hey Calanthe!” He said cheerfully, wearing his backpack the wrong way around so he could look through it. “I found something else- hey is your leg okay? You’re limping like crazy.“

”Wow, thanks Wes.” I roll my eyes. “Yeah, my leg feels like it’s being rolled in fire, but I’m fine.”

”Here, lean on me some.” I snort. 

”Really?”

”Really! We can get you crutches when we get to school.” He grins at me. 

I raise my eyebrow as he grabs my arm and puts it around his shoulders. ”So, you seem…awfully chipper today. What‘s up?” 

”I think I figured out how to save Beckett.” He starts digging through his bag, and I narrowly dodged an elbow to the chin. ”Oops!- You know what, I’ll just tell you during study hall. We should just get to school. We keep going at this pace we‘ll be late.”

I nodded, then paused. “Hey Wes?”

He tilted his head. “Yeah?”

”I forgot what line it was we were talking about yesterday, do you remember?” I was crossing my fingers, silently pleading ‘Please remember, please remember, please be Wes.’

His brow wrinkled in confusion for a second, and I was about ready to bolt, injured leg or not. Then his face lit up. “Oh, right! Almost forgot. I solemnly swear I’m not a bloody crank.” He grins at me. “Satisfied?”

I nod, stifling a yawn. He helped me all the way to school, and then practically shoved people out of the way to get to the nurse’s office to get me crutches. It was really nice of him, and I couldn’t help but think that maybe he was trying to help me in order to try to kind of make up for not being able to help Beck. 

I snuck a text to Andy during math, letting her know that she’d have to pick me up because I couldn’t walk to the bus stop with my leg. She texted back that that was fine, and then I got caught and had to turn in my phone. 

Study hall was at the end of the day, so I didn‘t see Wes for most of the day. When I finally did, he quickly waved me over to a corner. I hobbled over and sat next to him.

”So? What’d you find?” I asked impatiently. He grinned again.

”Aliens. It has to be. That pod was totally alien, right?”

I sighed. “Not this again. You were so mad yesterday about Beck. I can’t believe you’re joking about this again.”

He frowned “It’s not a joke, I’m serious. I wouldn’t joke about this. I want to get Beckett out of there as soon as I can. You‘re the one who said to do the research. I’ve done the research, okay?“

I crossed my arms. “Invasion of the Body Snatchers is not research, Wes.”

He seemed to be getting frustrated. “No, I did actual research, Calanthe, and I found something. What are you doing after school?”

”Andy’s driving me to a coffee shop so we can talk about this.”

”Oh.” He frowns. “Then come with me to the library, I’ll show you the article.“

Before I could respond, he had jumped up and asked for library passes, then ran over and helped me up. When we got to the library, he rushed over to a laptop, pulling up an article. 

“See? Aliens.” He said, pointing to the article. It detailed something that looked like a meteor crashing in the nearby mountains. I frowned. “What, mad that I’m right?”

”How are we the first to notice anything?”

”We aren’t. There’s a ton of online boards buzzing about it. It makes sense, see? That‘s where me and Beckett were hiking! I bet Cyndi was around there too. I say we go and check it out.”

I nodded. ”We could say that we’re hiking, get some rangers to come with us.“

He nods, beaming ear to ear. “We can make them fix Beckett.”

I grinned back. Just then the bell rang. “Oh, I gotta-“

”Yeah, let’s get you to Alexandria.“

I froze. 

“What? She’ll be wondering where you are!”

”Andy.” I said slowly. He paused, looking at me.

”What?”

”You‘ve never met her. I don’t really talk about her. Every time I do, I call her Andy. You wouldn’t know she’s a girl. Everyone assumes she’s a boy named Andrew.” He paused, realizing his error. “Even if you knew she was a girl, the assumption is Andrea.”

He shook his head. “Damn.” I backed away. “I was so close, wasn’t I?” He asked with a grin. How could I have not seen it earlier? 

“You’re not Wes.” I whispered. 

“Nope!” He said cheerfully. ”And, Calanthe, no point in running. We’re faster than you even without your leg.” 

I didn’t care. I chucked one crutch at him and took off, trying to ignore the pain in my leg. I could tell, though, that the sprint wouldn’t last long, and that I probably only had about thirty seconds before I wouldn’t even be able to walk. 

I slid down the bannister, refusing to look behind me, landing awkwardly on my leg and falling to the ground. I rolled and got back up, hobbling with the one crutch and leg, to see Andy sitting in her car. For the second time this week, I dove into her backseat, crying out as my leg slammed against the seat. 

”Just go! Go to my house, not the coffee shop, he knows where that is.” I panted. Andy looked confused, but listened, starting to drive. 

I looked out the window to see the fake Wes leaning against the doorway to the school. He seemed unfazed, and was grinning coolly. He gave me a jaunty little wave when he saw me. 

I understood why he was so calm. He knew where I lived, he knew where I was going, he knew Andy and I were the only two loose ends left. If it was even Andy I was with right now.

”Andy,” I said wearily, not sure what I would do if she was not her, “Just tell me honestly, are you you?”

She gave me a funny look in the rear view. “Uh, yeah? You okay, Callie?”

I shook my head. “Yeah, fine. Wes got replaced. If you’re not you, I don’t care anymore, just take me.”

She gave a little awkward laugh. “Well I am me, so hopefully that’s okay too.”

We got to my house, and instead of going to mine, I paused. Wes and Beck would be at practice to avoid suspicion. 

I went into their house. As I suspected, empty. I limped up to Wes’s room and looked in the hidden compartment in his closet. I was the only one he had ever shown. He joked once that if he started smoking or doing drugs, that’d be where he hid them. I checked it every once in a while to make sure he wasn’t actually smoking or anything stupid like that. 

Inside I found the paper I mentioned earlier. It looked like it had been ripped from a notebook, but which one I couldn’t guess. I’m sitting on his bed crying. I don’t know what to do. That seems to be a common theme, but really, I’m truly lost at this point. Andy’s downstairs, waiting on the porch for me to come back downstairs. I’m going down as soon as I post this. If I don’t update, you’ll know what happened to me. Keep your eyes open for anyone acting weird, and stay far away from them.
