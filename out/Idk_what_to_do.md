This happend when I went on a dog walk with my mom.

It was all fine until she told me to go ahead but return when I get to the end of the path as I was getting restless on my bike and she's on the older side.

I followed her instructions but tye path didn't seem to end, just wind on and on and on.

I'm not exaggerating here, and it's not a figure of speech, the path just went on.

I decided to go back as we must of not realized how long the path was so I made a u-turn back, but there was nothing but the path and the tress lining it for miles and miles.

I thought I just went to far so I started heading back, but it just went on and on and on until I saw something...

A totem poll, as I stared at it whilst riding past its eyes seemed alive and staring at me.

I just went faster at this point, I went onwards for what seemed like hours but must of only been around 45 mins.

I saw the same totem poll again, I thought I was on some giant loop and this whole thing was a prank but no I didnt go round and turns and none of my family or friends where jokesters.

I went onwards still till I found a little offshoot in the path, I went down it not wanting to round and round and round again and again and again.

As I went down this off shoot I saw a house, on closer inspection... my house.

A complete and utter copy of my house even down to the cat prints in the concrete.

I stopped riding and put my bike up against the garage's wall and entered my house.

Inside my house is something I still remember in vivid detail. My mom standing at the sink.

I know this doesn't sound scary but she hates doing the dishes and always makes me do it.

I said "hi!" In a nervous tone she turn her head in and impossible way never moving her eyes that where still locked on the sink.

She said in a voice not quite hers "hello honey, you went a head a bit, sit down so I can make you your favourite cookies, in my old age I forgot what those where. Could you remind me?"

Very odd I thought, she remembers stuff very very well.

I reminded her "it's chocolate and caramel chip"

She moved her eyes back and forth from the left corner of her eyes to the right, then eerily said in a monotone voice reminiscent of some sort of robot I vaguely remember from my childhood "silly old me always forgetting, oh Margaret"

I ran as fast as I could out of the house and onto my bike then peddled fast until I saw the totem poll from before blocking my path.

I went of into the field bordering the road.

I don't know what that was or why I'm here but I need awnsers...
This very moment I hear her voice calling for me to come get my cookies.
