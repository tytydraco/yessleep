I have been in their grasp since I exhaled my first breath. Every few days, a small section of my vision would be hijacked by an umber sprite (or several at times) that would taunt, shame and observe me. They rarely took the same form more than three or four times, choosing to put on a constant masquerade of varying features. This led to me frequently pondering on morning walks to school whether what I saw was mischievous, little cat darting around in haste, or perhaps the same black acquaintance that has seen me grow up. During the day, with the sun aiding me to make a distinction of what really was a plain shadow and what was one of these dark sprites, I felt at easy due to how effortless it was to distinguish between what everyone else could see, and what only I saw. Unfortunately, as the sun set, I would always be set into a state of panic, as now not only due to an increased isolation, but also due to the darkening of the surroundings, my ability to discern between what I perceived and what should have been there diminished.

Do not falsely presume that what I saw was exclusively a concoction of the demonic and the wicked, the umber sprites also took many forms that I perceived to be rather mundane and harmless. An obvious -yet memorable- example, was that of grape vine climbing up my bedroom wall, centimetres form where I lay. Due to the way in which the ghastly moon illuminated the wall, the figure was highlighted in such a way that it made the sprite resemble more of a shadow, where as it usually stood by my side like a solemn guard -despite this it did not make me feel any safer. As a result, this shadow, so boldly pressed against the grey wallpaper covering my wall one could assume that it genuinely was the product of a large grape vine sprouting from the courtyard. This confusion after years of exhausted acceptance of it profoundly expressing itself towards me, led (for the first time in years) for me to have my attention stolen by it. In a haze that was mixture of fatigue and ignorance I twisted my body to observe the window, from which the rays of moon light were entering and colliding with the wall. With clarity I could observe the other side of the courtyard, the slightly overgrown hedges grasping my mind as in their place there was no grand grape vine twisting openly towards the sky. Instantly, I realised that it must have been one of those illusions of darkness that has always plagued me. How did I not realise? That was not the only surprise of the evening.

I returned my body to its regular position, no longer perceiving the outside world- fatigue truly having settled into me. In an attempt to fall asleep, I was forcefully blocking all thoughts out of my mind- yet this effort was immediately halted as I was pierced with the quiet, but assertive voice whispering through the soothing silence of the night, "What do you regard *us* as now?" The fatigue immediately drained from me, as the true magnitude of the situation thoroughly set. This was the first time, that they expressed themselves in more than just mere appearance masking a portion of my vision, they could now further communicate with me through a voice that would sound so boldly in my mind that I almost instantly convulsed. I glanced back at the wall, on which the grape vines previously grew - not knowing what to expect. In their place, the lunar rays of light that had just aided them in creating an outstanding illusion, now flooded the wall, washing away any sign of them. The silent night that was murdered by the piercing voice, was now completely ripped away from me, as my blood ferociously circulated my body creating a deafening sequence of thuds- that was further assisted by the intensity and frequency of my breaths.

What made this particular moment unique, was that from then on, an eerie cheer- or possibly a chant- occasionally assisted these sprites in mocking me with their sudden appearances. In the days following the incident, the appearances of the sprites immediately threw my mind back to that evening where the grape vines fooled me, and later spoke to me. The image of their twirling shoots and bulbous grapes which plagues me would eventually shift, contorting into sinister smiles perpetually whispering in a soft, yet controlling tone, "What do you regard *us* as now?" No matter what environment I found myself in, during the week that followed, I was constantly contemplating that direct, but almost submissive, question posed to me by them- the implications almost being too grand to comprehend. To begin with, the "*us*", I thought to myself, must imply that there are several of them, a theory I previously held due to their occasional appearances as a horde of little humanoids, animals or even an army of flying theatre masks that swarmed me twice while I laid, overlooking the other side of a lake- but why do they address me in unison? Furthermore, they know what I think of them- my distain for them certainly is not prevalent, but they should know it's there- especially if they were to be a mere figment of my mind.

This frequent reflection to the image of the grape vine, culminated in me aptly naming these enigmatic sprites that permanently stalked me, "Grapes", a name which failed to encapsulate their variety of forms, boldness and reactions that they would garner from me, however succeeded in being a reminder of how unique each experience may be. 

Following shopping runs, my parents would bring home a clear basket of grapes (if they were to be in season) and offer me a bowl filled with a handful of them, still clinging onto the branch. They knew I was troubled. Frequent quick glances towards nothing throughout my youth led them to believe that there was something wrong- yet neither of us acted upon this "attribute", which is what they called it, never bothering enough to consult a professional. Therefore, at once when they discovered my strange aversion towards those red spheres, they seemingly understood, unfortunately their irritation was as usual poorly maintained. This lack of comprehensiveness from them, which I had faced since I was in the roots of my youth, instilled in me a sense of independence- perhaps the reliance I would have had on my parents was now placed in these Grapes that had followed me- more eagerly than those parents. Despite their attentive nature, the Grapes -now more than ever- caused my sweat to break out.
