I remember my grandson mark. or rezbir on reddit, wich showed me a post on r/nosleep that sent chills down my spine. it was named "it were inside of my dog" or something. It reminded me of an unsettling incident from my past, something I had pushed deep into the recesses of my memory. You see, I'm an old man now, pushing 70, and my story dates back to the late '70s, when I was a lonely soul living in my remote summer house.  
  
My life was devoid of companionship, except for my faithful cat, Mickey, named after Mickey Mouse. He was my only friend, and we spent countless evenings together. On one eerie night, I settled in to watch a movie, while Mickey curled up next to me. I put out his cat food and water, and life seemed simple and content.  
  
But then, it happened. As the movie flickered on the screen, I heard Mickey's meow, soft at first, then growing louder and more menacing. Startled, I thought he needed to go out, so I got up to open the door. Mickey brushed against my legs, trembling. I thought it was strange, but I chalked it up to a stray animal outside.  
  
As I opened the door, expecting him to dart out, something unsettling happened. Mickey's fur bristled, and he began to growl, a deep guttural sound that I'd never heard from him before. He hid behind me, his eyes wide with terror. I stepped outside, peering into the darkness, but there was nothing there. Just the quiet of the night.  
  
Hours passed with Mickey sitting vigilantly by the door, his eyes fixed on the inky blackness outside. Frustration gnawed at me as I couldn't comprehend his fear. But then, something changed in the air, an ominous presence that sent a shiver down my spine. The atmosphere grew heavy, and my heart pounded.  
  
I couldn't take it any longer. Grabbing a flashlight and a weapon, I stormed outside, determined to confront whatever had spooked my poor cat. Mickey, however, bolted into the woods, disappearing from sight entirely. I called for him until my voice grew hoarse, but there was no response. I spent the entire week searching for him, day and night, my worry growing with each passing hour.  
  
It was as if Mickey had vanished off the face of the Earth. I grew desperate, consumed by guilt and sorrow. on day 3 after my cats vanishing i called my dad. he could help me. but he couldnt come before next week. so i decided to drive home the weekend to pick dad up to keep searching for mickey. Then, on the night before I was supposed to leave my summer house, it happened.  
  
I was sitting on the porch, tears streaming down my face, when I heard a noise from the doorway. I turned, and there he was, Mickey, but he was different. His lower body was grotesquely deformed, and his face was a grotesque parody of his former self. Relief washed over me, and I rushed to pick him up, tears of joy welling up in my eyes.  
  
But as Mickey looked at me and smiled, something was horribly wrong. the weirdest part was, it wasnt a happy smile, wasnt a im home smile, it was a evil and wricked smile. and even weirder. animals arent supposed to be able to smile... at all. His movements were awkwar to, his gait unsteady, as if he had forgotten how to be a cat. An uneasy feeling settled in my stomach.  
  
Later that night, I woke up to a strange sound, a guttural whispering coming from the living room. I tiptoed to investigate, and there, under the pale moonlight, I saw Mickey standing on his back legs, his gaze fixed on the now-open back door. He was speaking in a language I couldn't understand, a language not meant for human ears.

what the f\*k had happened to my cat. tears were drowning me. but they stopped when i saw something sticking its face into the door. its red and evil eyes fixated on me it smiled and disappeared. then something i still cant seem to forget happened.  
  
My blood ran cold. Mickey turned to me suddenly, his eyes now devoid of any familiarity. He let out an ear-piercing scream that sent shivers down my spine and lunged at me with a jaw that seemed to expand unnaturally, resembling the maw of a monstrous squid.  
  
I had no choice but to flee. I raced to my car, heart pounding in my chest, and sped away into the night, leaving behind that cursed place and the horrifying entity that had taken the form of my beloved cat.  
  
I never returned to that summer house, and I've tried to put that nightmarish encounter behind me. But I can't help but wonder what had possessed my dear Mickey and what unspeakable horrors lurked in the darkness of those woods. And as I share this story with you now, I can only hope that you will heed my warning and stay far away from the unknown forces that may be lurking just beyond the veil of our understanding. 

my dear cat mickey. wherever you went. i still love you, 6 decades later. i still hope that you\`ll soon come home again. and even if this wasnt a supernatural occurance, the guy wearing my cats skin "if it wouldnt be supernatural" is scary anyways. i have a plan. tomorrow for the first time since 1970 i will drive to my summer house to take the life of the creature who possessed my cat that day. want me to write what i see? just comment. goodbye for now.
