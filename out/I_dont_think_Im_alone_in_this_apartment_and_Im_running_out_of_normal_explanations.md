I moved into this place three weeks ago and from the first night something has been off not like horror-movie dramatic just wrong in a way you can’t point at directly like the apartment is waiting for something. It’s that weird heaviness you feel in old places sometimes, except it doesn’t go away in the morning when the sun comes in. It just sits there like the air is holding its breath. I kept telling myself moving is stressful and my brain was inventing problems but the longer I stay here the harder it is to believe I’m imagining all of it.  
The weirdness started with the bathroom cabinet. It has one of those stiff magnetic latches that you actually have to push a little harder to close. I’d shut it all the way every night, hear that little snap, and then every morning it’d be open again not wide open just cracked like someone peeked inside and forgot to hide it properly. The kind of opening that looks intentional. I tried brushing it off as humidity or maybe the cabinet settling crooked except it didn’t feel like that. So I tested it one night before bed I shut it, waited, opened it, shut it again, tugged on it to see if it was loose. Nothing. Solid. The next morning it was cracked open an inch like usual. I told myself I probably forgot but then I taped it shut one night with a strip of masking tape I found in a drawer. When I woke up the tape was peeled cleanly off and placed flat on the counter like someone was being polite about it. That’s when I stopped brushing it off. Then there’s the sound in the hallway. It’s not footsteps, it’s more like fabric dragging slow, steady, like someone pulling a long coat or blanket behind them. It always starts around the same time too somewhere between 2:30 and 3:30 a.m. I thought maybe it was a neighbor with weird hours until I checked the building layout and realized that hallway only serves my unit. There’s no reason for anyone to be out there. And the sound always stops right outside my bedroom door. Not moving past it. Not fading away. Just stopping like whoever it is knows exactly where I am.  
Two nights ago I swear I heard breathing not close but layered into the silence like another person was trying to sync theirs with mine. I was half lying down scrolling on my phone and I started noticing it in that way where you’re not sure at first if you’re hearing something or imagining it. But it kept going, long slow breaths that didn’t match mine. I held my breath to check and it kept going for two or three more exhales before fading out like whoever it was noticed I was listening.  
I tried recording it the next night but the audio picks up nothing except a faint distortion that glitches right when the dragging sound should start. It’s this soft popping static that sounds like the microphone is refusing to acknowledge what’s actually happening. At one point the recording skipped forward a whole second like something interfered with it.  
Tonight it’s worse. The air feels heavier like someone is standing just beyond the edge of the light and the room is adjusting to them. I keep catching the reflection of something in the microwave door not a figure just a darker patch of dark like a shadow that forgot what it’s attached to. Earlier when I walked into the kitchen the overhead light flickered once then stayed on but the split second of darkness felt too long like something was stepping into place. I tried distracting myself by leaving the TV on low volume but the apartment feels like it’s listening even when the noise is playing. There’s this soft creaking in the walls every few minutes but not the usual settling it’s sharper like someone pressing their hand against the plaster from the other side. When I sat on the couch earlier the cushion next to me dipped just slightly like someone sat down with me but when I shifted the cushion popped back up.  
I also found something weird near the front door this evening. There’s a little pile of dust there now that wasn’t there before not regular dust but this almost grayish powder sitting in a small uneven line like someone scraped it off the wall. When I ran my finger through it the texture felt like dried plaster but the wall next to it looks completely untouched. No cracks no damage. Just dust with no source.  
I keep thinking maybe I’m overtired or stressed from the move but stress doesn’t peel tape neatly or time its noises to the moment you’re almost asleep. Stress doesn’t mimic your breathing. Stress doesn’t wait in hallways outside locked bedrooms.  
I want to believe it’s the building settling or pipes or my own nerves. I really do but something in this place is getting bolder and I’m scared that whatever has been staying in the corners is starting to step out. There’s this sense tonight that it’s closer than before like it’s been pacing around waiting for the right moment to make itself known.  
  
I’m going to keep the lights on and stay awake a little longer the dragging hasn’t started yet but the hallway is already too quiet like it’s holding its breath with me. If I hear it again tonight I don’t think I’ll be able to pretend it’s nothing.
