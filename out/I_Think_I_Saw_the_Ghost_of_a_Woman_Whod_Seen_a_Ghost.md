Hello everyone, my name is Sam, and I’m a hospice nurse working out of a modest clinic in Northern Ontario. For the sake of maintaining some level of confidentiality, I won’t disclose the name of the clinic or any of our patients. However, I otherwise aim to be wholly transparent with you all here.

I will tell you that the clinic where I work sits very close to a large lake, where those clients who are able-bodied enough are encouraged to fish, stroll, and so on. The hope is that these activities will have significant benefits for our patients’ mental and physical health, as suggested by much contemporary research (‘Leisure Activities and the Risk of Dementia’ \[2022\] by Su et al.; ‘Fishing Tourney to Benefit Group Morale’ \[2010\] by Godbey, etc.).

In other words, that lake is our very own fountain of youth, helping to temper the mental and physical deterioration caused by the advanced age of those under our care. However, lately, the lake seems to have changed, transforming from a wellspring of life to a very real threat in a sinister way, as if it’s a debt collector reaping mortal interest from all those souls it had nurtured over the years.

I first became aware of this terrible turn of events when my coworker John was severely late to pick me up for our morning carpool commute to the clinic. I picked up the phone and gave John a call. He informed me he was already at the clinic, driving around in his Accord, searching the area for any sign of one of his patients, an 88-year-old man named Henry.

John had woken up to a message informing him that Henry had been reported missing by the night staff. His door was wide open, everything inside seemed undisturbed, but Henry was nowhere to be seen.

I could tell John was frantic. I reassured him that I completely understood; I know well the toll it can take on a nurse to lose a patient metaphorically, so I could only imagine how John must have felt to lose a patient in the literal sense.

We were just about to hang up after exchanging our good lucks and goodbyes, when John shouted over the line, “HENRY! Found him, call you later!”

I was relieved, and as I hailed a cab to head to work, I imagined I’d find John as—if not more—relieved than I was. But as the taxi pulled around the bend and into the paved driveway of the clinic, I was struck by the melancholy sight of John slumped over, dejected and defeated, smoking a cigarette in his scrubs on a bench out front.

“John?” I called out as I slipped the driver a bill and stepped out of the car.

He looked up at me, but he didn’t wave, he didn’t smile, he didn’t move to greet me in any way at all. Instead, he just sighed, exhaled a wispy plume of smoke, and glanced over at the lake, vast, blue, and endless.

“Henry?” I asked, sitting next to him as he offered me a cigarette, which I wasted no time in declining. I’ve always been shocked by how many nurses I’ve met who smoke—they should know the risks better than anyone—but I try not to judge.

“Henry’s gone,” John sighed, his voice firm, though his hand shook tremendously as he brought the cigarette back to his lips.

“How?”

John took a moment before he motioned his head towards the lake. “Drowned.”

“Drowned?” I repeated quietly, as John nodded.

“Drowned. Right in front of me.” He sighed, resting his hand on his thigh as he shook his leg.

John explained. He’d spotted Henry by the edge of the lake while searching in his car and wasted no time getting out. Henry was just standing by the water’s edge, hands clasped behind his back, and according to John, he was faintly mumbling to himself as he looked over the blue expanse.

Henry had turned his head when he heard John approaching, smiled when he saw him, chuckled softly, and rasped, “Sorry, John, but… it’s Beth, y’know?” with a shrug of his shoulders before plunging into the water.

John jumped in after him, but after minutes of hopeless floundering, he couldn’t even find any trace of Henry to grab hold of. Henry had been lost to the waves.

“Who’s Beth?” I asked while John flamboyantly ripped the plastic off another pack of cigarettes, not even glancing at the grotesque images of rotted teeth and blackened organs plastered all over the box.

“His wife,” John coughed, banging his fist against his sternum to free up some mucus, “unless he was talking about a different lady.”

“Dementia, huh?” I asked, piecing together the situation in my mind.

“Seems like it,” John replied succinctly between puffs.

“Let me guess,” I asked, “Beth’s dead?”

“Oh yeah,” John sighed. “She’s long gone.”

“Sounds like Lisa,” I remarked, glancing back at the third-floor window of one of my patients, Lisa, who’d been suffering from some pretty bad episodes of Alzheimer’s.

“Speaking of,” John said, glancing back, “What’re you gonna tell Lisa?”

I froze. The thought hadn’t even crossed my mind until then. Lisa and Henry had become fast friends since they’d met at the clinic last year, and even seemed to have the makings of a blossoming romance, with all the flowers, love letters, and long walks it entailed. I knew well how deeply Lisa had cared for Henry, especially since I was the one tasked with picking the flowers she’d give him, transcribing the letters she’d write him, and sometimes—when she was having one of her episodes—supervising their walks. Now I would have to be the one to tell her their love would never have a chance to blossom. Her beau was gone.

“Better get to it,” John sighed, stamping out the butt of his cigarette as he rose to his feet, before glancing back at me when I didn’t rise with him. “Sorry. Good luck, mate.”

I steadied myself and rose to my feet. I had to go and tell her. She ought to hear it from me.

I told Lisa that Henry had passed that day. She asked me how, and I told her he had stopped breathing—the truth was far too morbid—but that he didn’t suffer. To my surprise, after a moment’s pause, she simply smiled lightly, and with a wave of her hand said to me, “Ah well, I’d had about enough of him anyway.”

I smiled back. She was taking it well. I suppose she’d always suspected this day would come and had ample time to prepare herself. It seems practice makes perfect.

I’d figured that was the last I’d hear of Henry, and for the rest of that day, it was. Even John seemed markedly better by the time we clocked out.

A 1 a.m. phone call changed all of that.

“Hello?” I croaked into the phone, bleary-eyed and exhausted.

“Samuel,” Lisa’s voice crackled over the line, sending me bolt upright in bed.

“Lisa?” I asked, my heart beginning to pound. Clinic policy dictated that all patients remain in their rooms after 9 p.m., which were devoid of phones. If Lisa was calling me, she wasn’t doing so from her room.

“I always thought you a good man, Sam,” Lisa breathed shakily over the phone, “but those things you said to me were horrible, just horrible. God forgive you, Samuel.”

“I’m afraid I don’t understand what you’re referring to, Lisa,” I mumbled, hurriedly texting the night staff to fill them in.

“Don’t give me that,” she replied gruffly, just as my phone lit up to notify me that Lisa had been spotted on the cameras, and the guard, Sean, was going to retrieve her.

“Lisa,” I stammered, “Please, we’ll discuss this in the morning, alright?”

“Fine,” she snapped. “But you’d better have a damn good explanation. Goodnight, Samuel.” She scoffed, slamming down the phone.

I sat there anxiously, waiting for any further word until I finally received confirmation that Lisa had been escorted safely back to her room.

“How’d she get out?” I inquired.

“Dunno,” they replied. “But don’t worry. This nonsense with her and Henry, I swear neither one’s pulling a Houdini again on my watch.”

Before I could reply with something along the lines of “I don’t think you have to worry about Henry,” I received a quick follow-up: “Sorry, forgot about Henry, Lisa’s got me all mixed up.”

I was a bit perplexed by the implications of his last comment, so after replying with just a ‘?’, he elaborated. Turns out as they were taking her back to her room, Lisa kept calling over her shoulder, wishing Henry goodnight. Seemed she was having another one of her episodes.

On that very sombre note, I thanked him and set my phone aside, wasting no time drifting back to sleep. Needless to say, when I was woken by another phone call at six in the morning, I was more than a little agitated, but that quickly morphed into overwhelming anxiety when I saw a flood of missed messages from Sean and Chris.

“Sean,” I snapped, answering the call, “What’s going on?”

“Lisa’s gone, man,” Sean spluttered, clearly just as panicked as I was. “She’s gone.”

“How?!”

“We don’t know, but her window’s open, and there’s a pile of clothes by the shore. Chris thinks they’re hers.”

“She didn’t jump, did she?” I asked fearfully, only for Sean to snap back at me impatiently.

“Mate, you’re a doctor, don’t you think there’d be a body?” Before, moments later, “Sorry… I’m kind of freaking out, y’know…”

“Keep looking,” I said, swinging myself out of bed. “I’ll be there soon.”

“Right,” Sean replied, and with that I fumbled on my clothes and ran out the door, calling an Uber—budget be damned in a crisis—and asking the driver as politely as I could to drive as fast as possible.

We made the trip in record time, and I found Sean by the door waiting for me. He told me that Chris had gone off to search in the woods.

Sean and I ran inside, trying our best to be quiet—we didn’t want to cause even more of an issue than there already was by alarming our other patients—and split up to search the clinic top to bottom for any sign of Lisa.

Naturally, I beelined to Lisa’s room, where I found the scene exactly as Sean had described. An open window, a missing woman, and out by the shore a dark pile of what I could safely assume to be Lisa’s clothing.

My heart was pounding faster than ever, and just to cover all my bases, I leaned out of the window to look down. No body.

I began to pull myself back inside when my gaze met a startling sight that froze me in shock. There, standing by the edge of the water, barely illuminated by the moonlight, her face hidden in the ethereal shadows of her wispy hair, was a woman: it was Lisa.

“Lisa!” I blurted out, before lowering my voice to a half whisper, half shout.

“I’m so sorry, Sam,” Lisa called back, her voice breathy and distant as though it were being carried gently by the breeze through the open window. “I’m sorry I yelled at you…”

“That’s really alright, Lisa,” I chuckled anxiously, resisting the urge to futilely try to reach out and grab her.

“You were right,” she giggled, “Henry is dead. I know that now.”

“I’m so sorry, Lisa,” I called out, fighting back the tears at the corners of my eyes.

“Don’t be, Sam,” Lisa laughed louder. “I’m the one who should be sorry. Come on, let me make it up to you.”

“Lisa!” I shouted as I saw her begin to take a big step backwards, her bare foot slipping down into the water.

“Come on,” she repeated, taking another step backwards, and then another. My heart sank as I realised how far out she’d gotten, yet she was still only submerged up to her ankles.

I was terrified—more terrified than I ever have been, and I imagine more terrified than I ever will be—as I saw her take step after step after step until she was standing—yes, standing—in the middle of the bay, almost a speck from so far away, still looking right at me.

“Please, Samuel?” Her voice floated in, loud and clear, as though she were right next to me, “Please let me make it up to you? For me?”

I couldn’t say a word; I was so frightened. I just shook my head ‘no’ over and over as emphatically as I could, and I could hear her sigh faintly.

“That’s a shame,” she exhaled. “You really don’t know what you’re missing. Goodbye, Sam.”

The moment those words hit my ears, I saw her moonlit figure shoot down below the surface, leaving not even a ripple behind. The lake, placid and still, was silent.

It’s now been a week since this nightmare began, but my mind can’t move on. I can hardly sleep, I can barely eat… I’m consumed by the image of that distant figure being yanked below the water. It haunts me.

What did she mean? Why was she so angry with me? What did she mean she’d ‘make it up to me’? And how did Henry fit in?

Above all else, I can’t help but ask, “Why me?” Why did it have to be me?

I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, and I can barely think. I could really use some help. Please.
