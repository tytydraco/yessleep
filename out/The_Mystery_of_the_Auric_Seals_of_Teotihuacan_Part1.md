I've learned to make myself invisible in hotel rooms. The slightly musty carpets, the over-starched bedsheets, the distant murmur of someone’s television bleeding through the walls - my world has been reduced to these anonymous spaces. Each one a little different, but all melding into a seamless pattern of hiding places and temporary havens.

Three days here, maybe four in the next, then I’m gone before my scent settles, before my presence starts to etch itself into the memory of the place.

I’ve worn so many aliases these past few weeks that I am slowly starting to forget the woman beneath them all.

The rules I follow are strict, but they’ve kept me safe since the incident.

 It’s been 3 months since that fateful day, yet its shadow continues to cling to me, a constant reminder of what I’m running from. Every day, I wake up wondering if things could ever go back to the way they were.

Sometimes, it feels like I’m endlessly on the run, constantly glancing over my shoulder, bracing for everything to eventually collapse. And sometimes, I even wish it would—just so that I could finally face whatever’s hunting me, to let it catch up, to let it engulf me if it must, simply to be free of this suffocating weight of waiting.

Every morning, I comb through the newspapers without fail, searching for any updates from the police about the case.

A small part of me even hopes they’ve managed to catch Ben—not because I want him behind bars, but because knowing he’s alive and well would bring a strange kind of relief. At least then, I’d have something tangible to hold onto—a shred of certainty in this endless fog of doubt and fear.

The phone in my hand, as I stood on the balcony of my latest hotel room, was a painful reminder of him. Most of the time, it stays buried in my suitcase, wrapped in layers of clothing, only allowed to surface once the sun has set and the streets outside have quietened down.

It was the last thing Ben gave me before we split, when the cops were closing in on us. Every night, I power it on for a minute—just long enough to check for any text from him, a message, a sign, something to tell me about the next move or the next destination.

In the weeks after the incident, Ben kept in regular contact.

Despite being on the run, he somehow found ways to send updates about his whereabouts, reassuring me that he was safe. For a month, we managed to stay connected even as the police circled closer.

When the heat began to finally die down, we had even started talking about meeting again, planning our reunion after this nightmare.

But then, out of nowhere, the messages stopped. It’s been over eight weeks since I last heard from him.

*Did he lose his phone? Was he arrested without my knowledge? Or did he cross paths with someone dangerous?* Ben always had a knack for getting into trouble, and the possibilities churn endlessly in my mind.

*Or did he simply abandon me?*

That last thought cut the deepest. *Did he leave me to fend for myself, knowing full well the trouble we were in?*

I powered on the phone and stood silently as it booted up. My fingers hovered over the screen as I checked the inbox. The last text I’d sent him was still marked undelivered. The same pattern, night after night, and it never failed to make me both anxious and angry.

With a sigh, I switched the phone off and leaned against the balcony railing, gazing down at the street below. A handful of cars rolled by, their headlights cutting through the stillness. On the sidewalk, a couple of late-night wanderers ambled along, their shadows stretching long and thin under the streetlights.

 I tried to focus on the quiet scene, searching for some semblance of peace, but my mind refused to calm down.

I was running out of money and had enough maybe to last another week, that too only if I stretched every dollar.

*Unless…unless…*

Before I could complete the thought, a sharp movement to my right suddenly startled me. 

My heart skipped a beat when a large bird swooped down, landing on the metal rail of the balcony with a solid thud.

It took me a second to realize it was a crow, and a large one at that, more like a raven as it locked eyes with me, tilting its head in that unnerving way birds do, before clicking its claws against the railing.

My breath slowed as recognition dawned. This wasn’t the first time I’d seen it. The same bird had perched on the balcony of my previous hotel room, in nearly the same way.

Was it simply scavenging for food from strangers? I wondered.

Yet something about it also felt oddly familiar, though I couldn’t quite place how.

“Are you hungry?” I finally murmured, the words barely audible, as if testing the air between us.

I stepped back inside, and rummaged through the minibar until I found a small pack of salted peanuts. Returning to the balcony, I opened the packet and held a few pieces out in my palm.

The raven hesitated, its beady black eyes flicking between my face and the offering.

Then, with deliberate caution, it hopped closer. Its sharp beak tapped against my palm as it picked at the peanuts, each peck sending a slight shiver through me. The sensation lingered, a curious mix of unease and fascination.

As I stood there, watching it eat, I realized just how long it had been since I’d felt the touch of another living being. Months of isolation, moving from one nondescript hotel room to the next, had left me starved of any connection. The thought brought an ache that made me long for Ben even more—his touch, his warmth, the fleeting comfort of knowing someone was there.

When the bird had finished, it lifted its head, staring at me with an intensity that made me wonder if it could actually see the thoughts swirling in my mind.

Then, as suddenly as it had arrived, it took off in a flurry of dark feathers, vanishing into the night.

I sighed and slowly walked back to my room and placed the phone back in its usual hiding spot in my suitcase, but my eyes drifted almost involuntarily to the zip-lock pouch lying beside it. The medallion inside caught the dim light, its gold surface glinting faintly.

"You’re the cause of all my troubles," I whispered bitterly, my voice barely audible as the weight of the words seemed to linger in the air.

I reached for the pouch and pulled out the medallion. It was about the size of an Olympic medal, its polished gold surface gleaming.

 One side of the medallion held a large ruby, blood-red and mesmerizing, while the other bore an intricate engraving—a sandglass with a bird etched behind it.

Leaning closer to examine the bird, my breath hitched. It was a raven, its form strikingly similar to the one that had perched on my balcony earlier. I hadn’t made the connection before, my attention always usually drawn instead to the vivid red ruby. But now, with the realization settling in, an uneasy chill crept over me.

I immediately felt my heart race again wondering if all this was nothing but an eerie coincidence. But deep inside, I intuitively knew that was not the case.

The weight of the medallion in my hand pulled me back to another moment in time—an incident at a pawn shop a few months back.

“Oh my god, what are these?” I remember asking Pete, the shop assistant behind the counter, my excitement mounting as I pointed to a locked display case set apart from the rest of the collection.

Pete slipped on a pair of gloves and removed a tray from the display case. He placed it on the counter in front of us, displaying two gold medallions—one centered with a deep red ruby, the other with a vivid green emerald, both sparkling under the store lights.

“What are these again?” I repeated, unable to suppress the fascination in my voice.

“These are the Auric Seals of Teotihuacan,” Pete explained, smiling. “They’re of ancient Mesoamerican origin and are said to be over 800 years old. We are currently looking to find a buyer.”

“They look gorgeous,” I murmured, instinctively reaching to pick one of the medallions. But Pete’s voice cut through the air, stopping me just in time.

“Don’t touch it,” he warned, his expression suddenly tense. “It’s …its supposed to be cursed,” he added.

I quickly pulled my hand back, as Pete wiped his brow nervously. I glanced over at Ben, who stood beside me all this time, his bored expression replaced by one of sudden interest. He raised an eyebrow and whistled softly.

 “Ooooh… that’s interesting,” he said, finally showing the first sign of enthusiasm I’d seen from him since we’d entered the shop.

My thoughts again cut back to the present again as I lay on my bed, the medallion resting in my palm, its cold surface pressing against my bare skin.

“Oh, the thing is cursed alright,” I said out loud, acknowledging how everything went to shit the moment it came into my possession.

On the other hand, this was the only remaining thing of value I had left with me and I needed to somehow sell it to get my hands on some of the money. But I also had to get rid of it without catching attention from the cops.

Exhaustion slowly washed over me as I weighed my options, and before I knew it, I had drifted off to sleep as the medallion lay next to me.

The next day, I got into my car, and just as I was about to start it, I spotted the same raven perched on a lamppost, it’s beady eyes fixed on me with an unsettling intensity. At that moment, my phone pinged. Retrieving it from my pocket, my heart raced as I saw a text from Ben—a set of coordinates to some unknown destination. Desperately, I tried calling and texting him back just to make sure it was him, but there was no response.

The raven suddenly took off, disappearing into the distance, while I remained in the car, grappling with the decision I knew I had to make. A few seconds later, I keyed in the coordinates and started driving.

I hadn’t driven far when I noticed the raven ahead, gliding low along the road, almost as if it were leading the way. The realization hit me—this was the same path the bird had taken.

I drove for hours, passing through scenic routes that looked like something out of an old postcard. From rolling hills dotted with clusters of trees to sleepy towns with cobblestone streets, the journey felt timeless.

Eventually, I reached a small, picturesque town and stopped in front of a peculiar yet elegant looking house. Its large purple door was framed by a row of neatly arranged plants along the portico, while a well-tended garden with vibrant flowers and shrubs completed the inviting scene.

As I sat in the car, staring at the purple door, I wondered what awaited me if I rang the bell. Stepping out, I slowly walked toward the door.

On the doorstep lay a half-open yellow colored Chanel bag overflowing with cash. One of the stacks had a large red stain on it which looked like dried blood.

For a fleeting moment, I thought about taking the bag and leaving, but before I could act, the purple door creaked open wide on its own.

I jolted awake as the alarm blared across the room, realizing I was still in bed, the coin clutched tightly in my hand.

Sitting up, I pressed my fingers to my temples, trying to ease the sharp headache pounding across my forehead.

A long shower and a hot breakfast at a nearby diner thankfully provided a modicum of relief.

Stepping out into the crisp morning air, I rubbed my hands together for warmth before slipping them into the pockets of my trench coat. My fingers brushed against the zip pouch holding the medallion.

Instinctively, I glanced across the quiet street looking for any sign of the raven, but it was nowhere to be seen.

I quietly got into my car and drove toward Gaimon Square, a busy place in this part of town where I was looking to sell the medallion.

Upon arriving at my destination, I parked my vehicle a few meters before the road split into three directions.

To the left, an alley led to a row of jewelry shops that lined the street, their displays faintly gleaming in the morning light.

Straight ahead stood the town's largest bank, the TransUnion Bank, perched atop a broad set of stairs and attracting a steady stream of visitors.

To my right was the square itself, an open space bordered by a park where a flock of pigeons fluttered about, pecking at grains tossed by an elderly man dressed in thick woolen wear.

As I scanned the area for cops, I spotted a patrol car in the distance. I knew I needed to maintain a low profile and be discreet.

Just as I was about to turn left and take the alley leading to the line of jewelry shops, I saw the raven again. It perched itself on one of the lampposts adjacent to the park.

But this time, his gaze wasn’t fixed on me. Instead, he was looking behind me. Turning around, I saw a young man sharply dressed in a suit, holding a briefcase. I watched him walk past me as he held a phone to his ear and stopped a few meters ahead, glancing around as if trying to decide where to go next.

The raven, still perched on the lamppost, suddenly let out a piercing caw. The sharp sound startled the flock of pigeons, sending them scattering into the air. The elderly man feeding them stopped and looked around, confused, as the birds abandoned the grains he had tossed on the ground.

Meanwhile, the man in the suit seemed to have made his decision. He turned left, heading toward the alley I was headed for.

Without warning, the raven shot into the air, its wings beating furiously before shifting into a controlled glide. It swooped down on the man, claws extending mid-air to snatch his phone, then immediately wheeled around and flew straight back at me.

As it approached, it dropped the phone into my open arms before returning back to the lamppost, watching the unfolding event with a keen eye.

Turning around, I saw the young man quickly closing the distance between us, his face twisted in panic, and sweat streaming down his forehead. Before I had any time to react, he crashed into me, and we both hit the ground hard.

As I lay sprawled on my back, he scrambled to wrestle the phone from my grasp, grabbed his fallen briefcase, and quickly got back on his feet.

With the phone pressed to his ear, he began to hurry toward the alley again, but stopped abruptly when he noticed two cops sitting in the patrol car staring directly at us.

The man started yelling on his phone, as the car began to drive in our direction. Meanwhile I instinctively reached into my pocket to check for my medallion, but suddenly, a sharp, splitting pain pierced through my forehead.

As the guy in the suit stood frozen to his spot, desperately glancing left and right looking for directions, I saw something impossible transpire even through the haze of pain – a version of him ascending those stairs with the briefcase clutched tightly to his chest.

The figure reached the topmost step, turned around in front of the bank’s entrance, and was obliterated in the next instant—his body blown to bits, leaving nothing but a crimson mist.

Before I could even process what I had seen, the man standing only a few feet in front of me suddenly bolted toward the bank.

Tossing his phone aside, he charged up the stairs like a madman, brushing past a woman who had just descended after her visit to the bank. The sudden jolt caused her to lower her sunglasses and glance back at him, a flicker of confusion crossing her face.

My stomach churned when I noticed a yellow Chanel bag slung across her shoulder as she then continued to walk in my direction. At that exact moment, the raven, still perched on the lamppost, abruptly took off, retreating from the scene and completely vanishing from view.

But my eyes were now all glued on the man in the suit who stood in front of the entrance with his back to the building, looking at the briefcase, which he held up at waist level - his face contorting into one of relief as if he was readying himself for what was coming next.

I scrambled to my feet and rushed toward the woman, who was now only a few feet away from me. Just as I reached her, the man lifted the briefcase above his head like a trophy.

Time seemed to slow as I watched his head explode, followed by his arms tearing away from his torso. His body split in little chunks, unleashing a powerful shockwave that sent us both hurtling back ten feet.

The police patrol car, which had just reached the base of the stairs, absorbed the brunt of the blast, shielding us from the worst of the impact. The force was enough to flip the car onto its roof, leaving chaos in its wake as panicked screams filled the air and people fled in all directions.

The woman lying beside me began screaming hysterically, her face streaked with dirt and blood, her lips split open from the blast. The shattered sunglasses with one lens missing, hung crookedly on her nose, leaving an exposed eye staring down at her own body in horror—where a severed hand rested uncomfortably on her chest.

She writhed and clawed at the air in desperation and swiped at it helplessly in an effort to get rid of it.

Finally, I grabbed the severed hand and flung it aside. Without a word, she stumbled to her feet and bolted, abandoning her bag in all that commotion.

Dizzy and on shaky legs, I forced myself upright, picked up the bag from where it had fallen, and fought my way through a herd of panic stricken people.

Reaching the car at last, I swung the door open, threw the bag inside, and collapsed behind the wheel.

My hands trembled uncontrollably, my ears buzzed with an unrelenting ring, and my heart pounded so hard it felt like it might burst.

For a moment, I just sat there unable to process what had just happened. Then I looked at the bag lying next to me. Slowly, I unzipped it, unsure of what I’d find.

It was packed to the brim with neatly bundled stacks of hundred-dollar bills.

As I stared in disbelief, a drop of blood trickled from the gash on my forehead, splattering onto one of the stacks and staining it red.

I closed my eyes and leaned back against the headrest, taking a moment to steady my breath and calm the chaos raging inside me.

When I opened my eyes, my heart started racing again—the raven was perched on a mailbox barely 20 feet ahead, its unblinking stare sending a chill down my spine. With a sharp, grating caw, it spread its wings and took flight, disappearing into the turbulent sky.

Without hesitation, I jammed the key into the ignition and started the car. There was no other choice left now but to follow it— especially after everything that had happened, after everything I’d seen, I had to see this thing through.
