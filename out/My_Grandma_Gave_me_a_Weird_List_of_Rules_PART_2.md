My grandma gave me a weird list of rules PART 2

My grandma saying those words made me remember everything vividly from that night. It was not a nightmare, everything was real. "Grandma, what happened?!" I ask her while freaking out.

She looks at me with a sad face and says "It's too late.. they already have your soul."

"What?" I ask again confused and desperate at the same time, but right before she could answer, everything goes black, it was like I fell into a void.I couldn't hear or see nothing for a time that felt like eternity. As I was waiting, still hoping I am just having a bad and long nightmare, I start hearing some screams. High Pitched screams like someone was having their organs removed while awake.

I recover my vision, and I look around. It seems like I am in an empty valley. I start walking, hoping to find someone that can help me or at least answer my questions.

I gasp as I see buildings, it looks like I am near a settlement. I start running until a dark silhouete stops me. He was around 3 meters tall, I look at him in fear. He nods and grabs my hand, drags me towards this weird building. It had red walls and was incredibly large, like something I have never seen before. While he was dragging me inside the building, I see other people. With other.. creatures. They looked lifeless, but alive at the same time. It was truly frightening, knowing that nobody will ever save me. We entered a room, where there were other dark silhouetes and creatures, that looked very mad at me.

The thing dragging suddenly stops, in front of all of them.

"You broke many important rules, even though your grandma warned you about the possible consequences."

I now realize I am in hell,remembering my grandmother's list of rules, and that I would face unimaginable things soon, so I get on my knees, and start begging for mercy. While sobbing and shaking in fear, one of them gets in front of me, and tells me "We are giving you this one last chance".

I look up, he punches me in the face so hard I pass out.I wake up back inside my grandma's house, in my room. I get up, and see the paper with the rules next to me. I read them again they are the same ones,however there were 2 extra rules.

EXTRA RULES. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION :)

8. If any of the creatures you've seen in hell enter your room, stop breathing, don't make any noise, or they will take you back. However, if you're lucky, nobody will bother you.

8a. If they catch you, you need to react fast. Remember that knife that is in your pocket? Stab the creature in its chest and they will leave you alone. If you don't react fast enough, then there is nothing that can save you.

9. Pay attention to every single rule. This is the last chance you get, if you won't abide to the rules we will torture you for eternity, until your soul is sucked out of you.

Good luck!

I look at my watch, It is 2 AM. I get in bed and try falling asleep.Suddenly, I hear someone enter my room. I close my eyes and try making no noise. I hold my breath till I almost pass out, and then I finally hear the creature walking away. Shortly after, I hear 5 knocks on my door, just like the night before I got sent to hell. I open the door, it's grandma. She sits on the bed next to me, and hugs me. "Thank god you survived." I try asking her about the traumatising events that happened. She refuses to answer. At exactly 8 AM we go towards the kitchen togheter and quietly eat breakfast.

After that, I get out of the house, I didn't even say goodbye to grandma. I just ran. I called my mom shortly after, told her about everything that happened. I could hear her crying and then she said "Now you know why we never visited Grandma."

After I get home, my parents tell me that my uncle had the same thing happen to him. I've always thought he died in a car crash, like they used to tell me when I was younger.

Even to this day, I am still traumatised by what happened, and I am trying to live a normal life.
