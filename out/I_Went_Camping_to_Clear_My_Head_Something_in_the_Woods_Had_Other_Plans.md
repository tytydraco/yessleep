I’m writing this with a camping knife in one hand and my phone in the other. Signal’s dead out here, but the battery’s still good. Maybe someone’ll find this. Maybe it’s just for me.

Either way, I need to get it down.

It was supposed to be a solo weekend. One tent. One fire. One man trying to forget how bad things got. I parked off a logging road around dusk, hiked a few miles until the trees thickened, and set up camp near a slow-moving stream. The forest here isn’t part of any national park—not even listed on most trail apps. A friend told me about it a few years back. Said it was “untouched.”

That’s a funny word for it now. Untouched. I’d say there’s something out here that’s been touching plenty.

The first night was fine. Quiet. Cold, but that was expected. Coyotes yipped in the distance. Normal stuff. I made a small fire, warmed some canned chili, then crashed early.

It was the second day things started to shift.

Nothing dramatic. Not at first.

Just off.

The birds stopped singing around noon. I noticed it while filtering water. One second, everything was chirps and rustling leaves. The next, just… nothing. Like someone hit mute on the entire forest.

I told myself it was normal. Animals go quiet all the time. But something about it stuck in my chest.

Like pressure.

Later that evening, I found tracks. Big ones.

Not boots. Not hooves. Barefoot. Human-shaped, but wrong. The proportions were off—heels too long, toes splayed wide. I wear a size eleven and these dwarfed mine. They circled my camp and vanished into the brush.

I didn’t sleep that night.

Every time I closed my eyes, I swore I heard twigs snapping. Not close. Not far. Just circling.

Pacing.

Waiting.

By sunrise, I was packed and ready to head back. Screw the weekend. Whatever this was, I didn’t want to be around when it got brave.

I made it about a mile before I saw something hanging from a tree.

At first I thought it was a deer.

Then I got closer.

It was me.

My pack. My clothes. Even my hat—torn and dirt-stained but definitely mine—strung up by thin cords of sinew, swaying from a branch like some backwoods effigy. The gear I’d packed that morning was still on my back.

I didn’t stick around to study it.

I ran.

But the woods didn’t seem to end. Every direction I turned brought more trees, more of that stifling quiet. I tried following the stream. I tried shouting for help. I even tried marking trees, but each time I circled back to the same spot: the effigy.

It was lower now.

Almost touching the ground.

I dropped everything.

Tent. Pack. Water. Knife.
The only thing I kept was the clothes on my back and the boots on my feet. Every instinct screamed at me to get lighter. Faster. Whatever was out here didn’t want my gear—it wanted me.

I sprinted in the opposite direction of the effigy, tearing through brush and bramble, branches slapping my face, lungs burning. My boots sloshed through mud and sunk into patches of soft earth that had no business being that wet. I don’t know how long I ran—five minutes? Fifteen? Time stretches when your brain flips into survival mode.

Eventually, I stumbled into a clearing.

A perfect one.

Circular. No underbrush. No fallen trees. No sound. Just short grass and a ring of stones—like the forest itself had been peeled back on purpose.

I collapsed at the edge, gasping. My knees gave out before I even realized it. The forest around me seemed to hold its breath.

That’s when I noticed the trees.

They weren’t right.

Not just bent or gnarled—turned. Their trunks angled inward, all of them pointing toward the clearing like a crowd straining to see something happen. The bark was darker here. Not rot. Not fire. It looked almost scorched in runic shapes—crude carvings that pulsed when I stared too long.

And in the dead center of the clearing…

A figure.

It stood motionless. Facing away.

Tall. Thin. Naked. Skin like stretched leather soaked in ash. No hair. No noise. No movement—not even the kind your body makes when breathing.

It hadn’t been there a second ago.

I swear to you—it hadn’t been there.

I backed away slowly, boots crunching the edge of the grass.

Then it tilted its head.

Not turned. Tilted. Like it was listening with something other than ears.

Something behind me cracked.

I ran again. I didn’t look back this time. Not once.

Branches whipped my face. Roots tried to trip me. But I kept going until I burst through a thicket and nearly toppled down a steep ridge.

And that’s where I found them.

Boot prints.

Not mine.

Not barefoot either.

Hiking boots. Multiple sets. Worn deep into the dirt. Recent.

I followed them, shaking and bleeding and half-mad with adrenaline, praying they led to people.

They led to a cabin.

Old. Slanted. A single window with boards nailed haphazardly across it. Smoke curling from a crooked chimney. There was a light on inside—a dull amber glow behind the warped door.

I didn’t knock.

I needed shelter. Safety. Something real.

The door creaked as I pushed it open.

The smell hit first: wet dog, ash, and copper.

Then came the whisper.

It came from the far corner, where the fire crackled low in a stone hearth.

“…he left his name in the leaves.”

I froze.

There was a shape by the fire. A man, I think. Slouched, long-limbed, back to me. Skin gray. Shirtless. His spine stuck out like a row of knives under his skin.

“…but we peeled it out.”

I turned to leave.

The door was gone.

Just wall now. Seamless. Like it had never been there.

I didn’t move at first.

Didn’t breathe.

Just stared at where the door used to be, heart pounding so hard it felt like it would punch through my chest. I told myself it was a hallucination. Shock. Fear. Exhaustion. Maybe I missed the door.

But I hadn’t. I knew I hadn’t.

The thing by the fire didn’t stir.

I backed away—slow, quiet. Each step deliberate. Careful.

I scanned the cabin. No other exits. No loft. No trapdoor.

The window was the only option now.

I crept toward it, eyes darting between the boards and the thing by the fire. The wood looked old. Dry. Breakable. But the nails were long, rusted into the frame. I’d need something—anything—to pry them loose.

I checked the counters. Drawers. Shelves.

Empty.

Except for one item, sitting alone on a warped butcher’s block.

A knife.

Not a camping knife. Not a kitchen knife.

Something older.

Its edge was curved, the handle wrapped in something that looked like sinew. The blade shimmered—not with light, but with something underneath it. Something that pulsed in time with my heartbeat.

I didn’t touch it.

Instead, I backed into the far corner, as far from the fire and the window and it as I could. I sat down, knees to chest, trying to slow my breathing. Trying to disappear.

And the thing by the fire finally moved.

Not a shift. Not a twitch.

A rise.

It stood without using its hands, vertebrae popping like knuckles, neck craning in a way that was too long. Too fluid.

It turned toward the hearth.

Not toward me.

It lifted something from the flames.

Cloth.

Charred and torn and soaked with something black. It unfolded it slowly, reverently, like a priest unveiling a relic.

It was my shirt.

The one I had packed. The one I left behind.

It sniffed it.

Smiled.

Then it spoke—not to me. Not to anyone. Just to the cabin itself:

“Not yet.”

And it draped the shirt over a hook beside the hearth.

I didn’t move. Couldn’t. I stayed curled in that corner for hours, maybe days. Time didn’t work right in that place. Hunger stopped. Thirst too. The fire never died. The thing by the hearth never spoke again. It just sat there. Watching the flames. Breathing slow. Heavy.

Like it was waiting.

Eventually…

I woke up in the woods.

Right where I started.

No cabin. No fire. Just me, lying in the dirt, soaked in sweat with my old gear piled beside me.

Everything intact.

Even the shirt.

Except for the inside of the collar.

There’s something carved there now. Tiny. Sharp. Like it was etched in with a pin or a claw.

It’s not in any language I know. Not words.

But I see it every time I close my eyes.

And I know what it means.

It means I’m still in the circle.
