So, I need some advice. I don't know how to handle this situation, and I'm both afraid and paranoid. This whole situation has been affecting my daily life, and I feel completely lost. Any advice would be appreciated regarding this, I barely feel safe in my own home anymore. I'll explain what happened recently to cause me to feel this way below. I also have some previous posts on my account and a link to my YouTube channel where I go more in-depth on stuff that is going on so you guys can get a better picture of what I'm going through right now.

I had an old Rottweiler-Pitt Bull mix named Wyatt. I’ve had him since I was a baby, he was probably around 16-17. Huge dog, around 120lbs, but a big softie. He was very protective of me, and he would even chase away foxes and coyotes back when we had chickens. He would never hurt anyone, unless they tried to harm me or my animals. I would let him outside every few hours or so to prevent him from having any accidents inside the house because he was getting older and couldn't really control his bladder. He also had bad arthritus so I would have to help him up if he layed down. He usually would stay outside for 10 minutes or so (sometimes longer so he could lay in the sun,) then he scratches at the door to be let back in. No barking or anything, he only barked to alert me if something or someone he didn't recognize was outside. I let him out about 2 weeks ago in the evening, he never scratched on the door. After 45 minutes or so I began to get worried, so I went out to check on him. I spent a good 20 minutes searching before I found his body behind my shed, his head torn off from his body. I couldn’t find his head.

His body had no bite marks and no wounds, just his head ripped off. It wasn’t a clean slice, like a sword; it was like it was TORN. There was no signs of struggle around, and I didn’t hear him yelp or bark, absolutely nothing. Just a pretty big puddle of what looked like fresh blood under him and around his neck where his head was torn off. I have no idea how long he was dead for before I found him, but his body was still kind of warm and stiff, like he hadn't been dead for that long. He also had fresh blood under him, and seemed to still be bleeding a bit from his neck. Safe to say I booked it out of there, and only came back the next day to retrieve his body and bury him.

This same exact thing happened to my cat Smokey a while back, but he was covered in bite marks. I came to the conclusion it was probably coyotes, as those are pretty common around here. I don't know if it's just me being paranoid, but I think both of them dying very similarly must mean they were connected in some way. But, I don't think coyotes can just kill a 120lbs dog without any sounds or struggling, let alone tearing his head off of his body. I'm not sure what could've killed them anymore. I don't have any wolves nearby, so the safest conclusion that I can come up with is some human. But then again, a human doesn't leave canine bite marks. I've also been considering that creepy ass deer could be the cause for their deaths, but I don't want to think about that thing right now.

Speaking of the deer, I haven't actually seen it around recently. I saw it once really late at night, I'm talking maybe 1:00am. It was just standing near my pool on all fours, it's jaw just hanging. I don't know if it was just difficult to see because it was night, but it looks like it lacks eyes now?? I can't tell if this is the same deer that is somehow changing, or if it's several different deer. I don't think it saw me when I peeked out of the blinds, it was just slowly walking around and making these weird gurgling sounds. That was 2 days before Wyatt was killed, and I haven't seen it since.

Aside from that, I also had 2 of my cats dead a month or so back, too. Their heads weren’t torn off, but they were laid in front of my door in a way that means they could’ve only be placed there by someone or something. They were laying on top of eachother, streached out with their nose touching the others tail, right in front of my front door.

I’ve called the cops, and they’ve come to my house and told me they literally cannot do anything without evidence of someone being on my property. They told me not to worry too much because it probably was coyotes or some stray dogs. I’ve set up 4 motion detection security cameras around my property, and the cops recommended that I leave the house until I feel safe. I’m currently staying upstate in a motel until I feel safe enough to return. My friend Malory is watching the animals for me.

I’m just really scared and don’t know what to do. I already set up cameras and I’m staying upstate for a few days to get my bearings back, but I just feel so uncomfortable and unsafe in my home. Any advice on what I can do to protect myself and my animals would be appreciated.

Also, as a quick side note; if someone who is reading this did this to my poor animals and you're unlucky enough that I catch you, I'll slith your throat then rip your head off like you did to my animals. You don't deserve to rest easy at night knowing what you've done, and I'll make sure that you die slowly and painfully. Rot in hell.
