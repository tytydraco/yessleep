It’s been a week since the outbreak began — the result of a screw-up by one of the biggest scientific research companies in the country.

They said they were saving the planet. Their invention, they claimed, would clean the air: remove pollutants, neutralize harmful particles, even reduce greenhouse gases. They spoke like they were addressing children — reassuring, condescending, calm.

Now, the world is falling apart.

I remember the announcement clearly. My girlfriend — ex-girlfriend now — had insisted we watch it. We were curled up on the couch when the broadcast began. A man in a crisp suit stepped up to the podium, flanked by government officials.

“With full support from the government, we are proud to unveil the world’s first major step toward reversing man-made ecological damage,” he said. “After years of tireless work, my team presents to you the Autonomous Ionized Reclamation Apparatus, or as we like to call it: AIRA.”

The room applauded. I sat there, half-listening, until they revealed the machine.

It looked like something out of a sci-fi film — smooth, chrome, spherical, hovering a few feet above its pedestal. Parts of it shifted and clicked into place, panels rising and falling like it was breathing. No wires, no propellers, nothing to keep it aloft. Just... hovering.

It gave me a strange feeling — awe, mixed with unease.

The man continued, smiling.

"I know some of you are wondering how it floats. Unfortunately, the answer to that is classified. But rest assured, the science is sound. And soon, the air around you will be too.”

I remember being disappointed at the lack of detail, but curious. AIRA was designed to clean the air — to filter out harmful elements and leave behind only the purest atmosphere, even in crowded cities. They planned to deploy several units in select urban areas within days.

The news droned on. My girlfriend and I ended up talking about hovercrafts, science fiction, the usual nerdy stuff. We didn’t think much of it.

Then the machines appeared — just like they promised. Videos surfaced online of them silently hovering above rooftops in different cities. Reactions were mixed: excitement, suspicion, conspiracies. But even the skeptics couldn’t deny the results.

It worked. At first.

Within days, the air felt noticeably cleaner. Crisp. Like being in the woods after a thunderstorm. Gone was the familiar smog that seeped in through every crack and window. It was... unnatural, but refreshing.

Around that time, I decided to isolate myself. My girlfriend left to visit her parents, and for reasons I still can’t fully explain, I told her I’d stay behind. Maybe I just wanted a break — a chance to binge a new game and enjoy some peace. I stocked up on pre-packed food and holed up in my "man cave."

I lost track of time. Days blurred together.

When I finally snapped out of it, I tried calling my parents — no answer. Called my girlfriend — nothing. That’s when I checked social media.

That’s when everything fell apart.

Posts about riots, lootings, people snapping for no reason. One video showed someone calmly setting fire to a grocery store while laughing. Another showed a man stabbing his best friend over a sandwich.

Then I saw it — a post from two days ago, right when I went into isolation. Someone claiming the machines were causing it. Most people mocked the theory in the replies... but the more I scrolled, the more people started agreeing.

They weren’t joking anymore.

I spent hours reading post after post, watching video after video. And I started to notice something. The people in the videos didn’t just act violent. They acted wrong. Like something inside them had eroded — morality, empathy, logic. Gone.

That’s when I had the thought. Probably stupid, probably wrong. But... what if it’s the air? What if the longer you breathe it in, the more it changes you? Not in some obvious, zombie-apocalypse way. But slowly — like it scrapes away your soul one breath at a time.

I hoped I was wrong.

Then, thirty minutes ago, I got a call.

It was her.

Before I could even say hello, she was screaming at me. Accusing me of abandoning her. Saying I never cared. Her voice was hysterical, venomous, like someone I didn’t recognize. She hung up mid-sentence.

I tried calling her back — no answer.

I slumped into my chair, overwhelmed. But then... my phone buzzed again.

Motion detected: Front Door Camera.

I opened the feed — and there she was.

Standing outside. Staring at the door.

At first, I was about to rush to open it — relief flooding through me — until I noticed something smeared across her cheek.

Blood.

Her smile was stretched too wide, unnatural, like her face was straining to hold it. Then she laughed — sharp and manic — and pulled something from behind her.

An axe.

She brought it down against the door with terrifying strength.

The first strike cracked the wood. The fifth made a gap. She reached through, found the latch, and opened it.

She let the air in.

I’m upstairs now, writing this as fast as I can. I can hear her moving through the house, calling my name in a singsong voice. And I can feel it too — the air. It’s colder. Heavier. Like it’s crawling down my throat.

I don’t know how long I have before I change. Before I lose whatever’s left of me.

I have two choices: face her... or go outside and breathe more of that corrupted air.

Either way, I’m not coming back.

If you're reading this and still have your mind... good luck.
