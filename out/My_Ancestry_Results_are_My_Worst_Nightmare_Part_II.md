I  had no time to think about what to do as my biological father literally glided across the floor to my bedside, so I acted on my first instincts. 

Even though contact with the outside of the old leather pouch had burned me, I suspected the whole of the contents inside could do far more damage to him if I played the scenario in my favor, so I attempted to slowly set up in my bed while maintaining eye contact with him. 

I’ll be honest, I didn’t expect to be taken back by the seemingly sincere expressions on his face; he wasn’t pale or menacing and he didn’t have red eyes, nothing malicious came across in what I was seeing in that moment. 

Truth is he looked like an average, middle-aged, European man. He stood about 5’10” had dark brown hair, a strong jaw line with 5 o’clock shadow, and his eyes were hazel. His voice, that had seemed so ominous when he entered the room was soft but direct. 

He then asked me how I was feeling. I hesitated but began to describe the breakdown of my body which you could tell he already assumed by the knowing look in his eyes. He assured me that all would be well in just a matter of moments and that’s when he snapped his fingers.

In walked in the head nurse from down the hall as though she was marching to dove unheard orders. Her eyes were nothing but white and veiny and she commenced to stand directly in front of me in a solid state of other-worldly control and hold her left arm out in front of my face. 

That’s when De Ville informed me that this was my cure and my key to unlocking a future of vast opportunities. I could literally begin to smell the blood pulsating just under her skin and realized that despite my denial, I fully understood what I was becoming and what I would need to do in order to survive. I didn’t hesitate when it came to what needed to be done next:

I began to stoop forward towards her outstretched arm, but dove to the floor and grabbed the pouch, it burned me as I suspected but I pretended to have fallen over and held it close to my chest as my “father” attempted to pull me up. That’s when I turned and threw the contents into his face. 

The moment those granules hit his skin, his literally face caught on fire and he began to shriek and curse me. His composure was no longer meek but rather of a rabid and irate beast that I knew had every intent of killing me once he recovered as he writhed on the floor and continued to shriek in a way that reminded me of what movies portray large prehistoric beasts to sound. 

With nothing but sheer will and what remaining adrenaline I had, I dove out into the hallway and dragged myself down the hall. I made it to the end to the glass doors that I knew would lead to the blood bank. 

I pondered for just a moment, but I knew I had no other choice as I smashed the case in and grabbed a handful of IV bags. I reasoned that this blood was willfully donated, albeit for not this reason, but certainly not via violent methods. I immediately started chugging on the first one I could open. The first taste almost made me hurl, but within seconds the blood began to taste like the most beautiful mix of both honey and the finest steak you’ve partaken of

When it was all said and done, I had downed close to a dozen bags but realized that I was now standing fully upright and felt like I could run a 5k. 

That’s when I spotted De Ville down the hall and striding towards me with a considerable  labor to his steps, but the blood on his face told me that the head nurse I left in the trance in that room had suffered the consequences of my actions. 

This hall was a dead end and I realized that he was gaining strength by the moment as his gait towards me began to increase in speed. 

I did the only thing that seemed logical based on what I knew about what I had become: I grabbed the whole remaining rack of blood transfusions dove head first out the window of that 13-story room. 

You always imagine that you’ll have time to realize what happening if you ever fell from a distance but the reality was that my right side hit that pavement in just a mere moment of thought and the wind was completely knocked out of me. As soon as I came to my senses, I used my left arm to open another transfusion and chugged it. 

This gave me just enough strength to stand upright, although I realized my right hand had been broken and was now bent at a 90 degree angle, but I could feel it begin to correct itself as I bounded around the other to the entrance of the hospital. 

I had never been so thankful to see a full and chaotic crowd of people scattered across the front entrance of the hospital as staff had EMS were still evacuating. 

Something caught my peripherals and I realized that De Ville was scaling down the walls of the building and towards me. When he locked eyes with me, I didn’t have time to think, I just knew I needed to disappear and fast, so I dove into the crowd and then found my way to the nearest ambulance. 

To my fortune the ambulance was empty when I climbed into the back so I shut the back doors and climbed to the front where I found the keys still in the ignition with it still running. 

I don’t know the extent of my father’s abilities so I took a gamble and decide the best approach was to calmly pull away and hope no one noticed their vehicle being hijacked. Somehow, I actually got away with this, and once I made it around the block, I laid it down to the peddle and turned the lights on. 

That’s when I heard and felt it. My father’s voice as though he was sitting right next to me in the passenger seat along with an intense pressure in my temples:

“You understand that there must be consequences for your defiance don’t you?”

I yelled for him to get out of my head and felt the relief as he “left” me. 

I floored it to the nearest shopping mall to ditch the ambulance in the parking lot. 

I grabbed a spare set of EMS attire from the back and reasoned it was better than a hospital gown. 

I had just made it into the mall and decided to make use of this outfit and ask to use a stranger’s cell phone. Surprisingly, the first guy I pleaded with turned me down, but the lady standing next to him surrendered her phone. 

It didn’t get to the second ring before i heard my adopted mother’s phone pick up but a moment of silence hung in the air before I recognized the voice of my adopted father pleading with someone in the background. 

That’s when De Ville began to speak:

“In time you will understand this moment to be quintessential turning point in your life”

That’s when the call was switched to video and before I could process what I was seeing I realized that De Ville’s hand not holding the phone had transformed into a large and dark web of fingers with one outstretched middle claw. He then casually ran it under my mother’s chin before subtly swiping beneath it. 

The blood simply sprang freely from her corroded artery as I stared into the only mother I’d ever known’s eyes as the life left them. 

My adopted father yelled with all of his might before the phone dropped and surmised that what I was now hearing was his own throat being torn away. Along with primal sounding slurps emanating through the phone line and then a pause. 

“See you soon, my son”

I hung up the phone immediately and shoved it back into its owner’s grasp as I ran into the parking lot. 

I’m ashamed to admit this, but I once again used the outfit I was wearing to commandeer something and this time it was a sweet little old lady’s car. 

A short while later, as I sped eastward on the interstate, my plan began to formulate.I need to find a way to get to Estonia.
