I was supposed to be murdered yesterday, but I survived. After my last post, I still kept trying to get the police to deal with my apparent stalker watching me from the park. They attended two more times, told me there was nothing of concern and then eventually deemed me a nuisance caller so that was, as expected, a dead end. I drove myself insane picturing how he was going to kill me. Over the next few days I couldn't sleep, eat or bring myself to leave the house. Then something inside me switched, I realised I couldn't just sit around waiting for this to happen. I tried to rip pages out of the book, I tried to edit and add sentences, trying my best to change the outcome. Somehow it would return to the way it was by the next morning, except with more text added describing my attempts and there was even a mention about my Reddit post looking for help.

Once I came to terms with the fact the police weren't helping and that I couldn't change the story by editing the book myself, I realised my last option was to prepare to protect myself physically. The book said he would ambush me before he killed me, that I wouldn't get the chance to try and fight back, so surely the book had ruined his element of surprise? I knew the date he would do it, so why not just stay inside the whole 24 hours with weapons of some sort so I could fight back?

I live in the UK so it's not like I could just go out and buy a gun or something, so I went out and got what I could such as knives, a baseball bat, a nail gun and whatever else I could get my hands on that would give me a fighting chance. I went home and placed each of the items in easily accessible places in each room, I moved furniture around to try and create areas where I could try and hide or take cover if needed. Once done I felt a lot better about my chances and had nearly convinced myself that I could get through it.

Yesterday morning I awoke feeling nervous. I'd made a promise to myself to stop checking the book because it was driving me insane, so I fought the urge to check to see if anything had changed because if it hadn't, I knew it would destroy any confidence I now had and I would spiral. The whole day I was on edge, checking every corner of each room I went into. I must have checked all of the doors and windows at a least a hundred times. I wouldn't watch any TV for fear of me not hearing anyone coming near or into the house.

&#x200B;

Once the sun set I was starting to doze off, obviously exhausted from being so scared and stressed all day. Then “BANG BANG BANG” on the front door, I bolted up with a knife in my hand and reminded myself of the baseball bat behind me on the chair. My eyes stayed locked on the front door and although I didn't realise it at the time, I was holding my breath preparing for someone to break in. Shortly after I heard a woman say “Come on, let's go to the next house, they mustn't be in.” In all the chaos of the last week I had completely forgotten it was Halloween.

&#x200B;

For the next hour I sat on the floor gripping the knife, rocking back and forth feeling like my brain was fracturing from fear after each knock from trick or treaters. I was asking myself how am I supposed to be prepared for this when so many people are knocking at the door every few minutes distracting me? If my eyes are locked on this door how do I know he isn't trying the back door? That's when I decided I couldn't take it any more, I'll ambush him instead.

&#x200B;

Thanks to the book, I knew he'd be watching for the perfect moment to strike from the park. I left my house through the back door with my hood up, the bat in my hand and the knife in my pocket. I waited for a group of kids to walk up my path to knock, once they started to leave I quietly caught up behind them and slipped into the street where there were plenty of groups of kids and adults milling around, hoping I'd blended in enough for him to not see me coming. Once I'd got to a darker part of the street I quickly crossed and entered the park.

&#x200B;

I scanned the treeline the book mentioned to see if I could see anyone and there right across from my house was a man dressed in black perfectly concealed in the bushes, looking across towards my home with a set of binoculars. Next to him was rope, a large knife and a camera. I felt sick to my stomach knowing those things were meant for me.

&#x200B;

I knew I only had a moment to act, so I gripped the bat tight and asked “what are you doing?” He spun around with a look of fear on his face but once he realised who I was, he smiled. I instinctively took a step back and I held the bat up to show him I was willing to use it, he walked towards me with his hands held open so I told him to stop where he was. He stopped, smiled again and said “looks like you just couldn't stay away either”. I wanted to vomit right then and there. I pushed the bile down and asked him what he wanted from me, his eyes went towards the knife.

&#x200B;

I swung the bat at him to force him back away from it but once I screamed for help he dove for it, I continued screaming whilst wildly swinging the bat at him and luckily some Dad's out with their kids heard and come running. After a scuffle and luckily only some superficial slashes to the arms of the Dad's, they managed to restrain him and keep him there until the police came. They arrested him and took mine and a few others statements, then I was able to return home with some relief. I couldn't quite believe I'd got through it.

&#x200B;

I walked into my bedroom and seen 2am on the clock, I smiled realising I'd actually survived. I went to my dresser curious to see what the book now said but it was gone. In its place there was a note that said:

“Congratulations on your survival, who would have known you had it in you. Thanks to you, instead of a tragic ending for my main character, I have a pivotal moment that **should** shape the rest of the story. Now keep it interesting and I won't need to interfere again.”

No name left, no other information. Clearly I'm the main character they're referring to but what the hell are they talking about? I'm not a character in a story I'm just a normal person trying to live their life, or so I thought anyway. I know the book is real but how is this even possible?! All I know is that what was written in it actually happened up until my confrontation with the stalker, so I can't exactly take this note lightly because I *do not* want to live through another hellish situation like this again, which the writer is very clearly able to orchestrate. Were they just going to kill me off because I'm too boring?! I guess my only option is to try and keep things more interesting in future, any ideas?
