A recap from my first post 

During lesson 3 my bowels alerted me to an evacuation protocol so I went to take shit after the gruesome event was over I cleaned myself up and left the toilets but to my surprise I saw multiple people covered in blisters and pale as the moon, then I got chased, then I set up a small base inside the school gym and now we’re here

I didn’t mention the time in my last post so I’m telling you now my last post was finished about 22:30 as I spent a while trying to barricade doors and eating, I’m not gonna do chapters this time as I’m typing as it happens so I need to try and find a way to evade these monstrosities (I’ve been calling them zombies but they aren’t really zombies so if anyone has any suggestions go for it) thanks to u/ThatRandomOctoling for suggesting vents and ceiling panels. 

since vents are usually too loud and too small I’m gonna go with ceiling panels luckily there is one missing in the gym directly above a pull up bar so someone must’ve messed around with it and has indirectly helped me I’m gonna toss my phone up and try to clamber up, I made it after 4 tries I’m currently crawling above the music corridor and man I need to leave some markers for important locations such as stairs or staff rooms  it’s an abyss up here, I’m gonna try and get some things to better defend myself like knives or something and wait I hear crying coming from below me.

Holy shit it’s a year 7 I just took off a panel and put it aside, he doesn’t have any blisters and looks healthy I don’t think he’s one of them, I thought it was weird that I was the only one out off class when this happened I’m gonna try to get his attention without alerting any angry zombie boys, ok I’ve told him that I’ll come back with a skipping rope for him to climb up while I hold it, okay I’ve got him in the gym with me now he’s still crying understandably I told him that I’m going to place a few markers in the ceiling and to pass me some chairs when I’m up so I can mark locations

Okay I’m above the stairs leading to the P.E corridor I’ve placed a chair above the panel next to the wall so if we need we can use that to get down and if we use it to get up we have to pull it up with us, like I said in a comment on my last post these things have intelligence, I’m not sure how much but they can learn by watching me do something so we need to be careful and

SHIT
there’s an angry one on the stairs I don’t think he saw me though, he’s scratching at the door to the corridor below me so I don’t think he knows how to open it, if I can maybe get behind him I could try and take him out with the chair, uh oh I hear more coming up the stairs there trying to get through the door to the corridor hopefully the chairs I barricaded it with will be enough, ok they seem to have left I’m gonna have to try and climb down to get to the lunch hall so I can get more food later, hopefully this will be over soon but I doubt that will happen, I’m gonna try and figure out a way to get their attention the angry ones are easy to distract if they haven’t seen me but it’s the pale ones that really don’t care for anything and it seems they get increasingly aggressive towards everything over time so maybe I can wait for one to turn and then lure the to a secluded area then barricade them in since they can learn to open doors,

the year 7 just told me that he saw his friend get eaten by an angry zombie that’s gotta be traumatic as fuck I feel terrible for him I asked him how he got away and he said “We were running through the computer hall then he told me that we should hide in the library under one the librarians desk, so we ran in and hid it was the worst 2 minutes of my life and then it got 10 times worse when it found us and as we were running away my friend tripped and got stuck under a table and I saw the monster bite his neck before he could get out a scream”

Shit my phone is about to die so I’m gonna save what I have so far and then I’ll have to rummage through some bags when it’s safe,

It’s been a day since my phone died so I’m gonna give a recap of what happened after it did

“Shit” I sighed “I’m gonna have to go find a charger”
“Ok what should I do while you’re gone”
“Just stay here”
“But I-“
“Stay here”
I hoisted myself into the ceiling then began to crawl I heard him mutter something but I couldn’t make it out, I reached the chair marking the stairs pulled up the panel carefully placed the chair on the floor then lowered myself I moved the panel back into its place then made my way to the places that were most likely to have a charger, the staff rooms.

After a lot of sneaking past windows and zombies I made it to the first staff room, opened the door to see no one in there “Yes” I mumbled as I walked in but there was no charger in any of the bags or sockets so I left, I began the journey to the next closest staff room and miraculously found one there I gladly started to head back to the gym when I heard a scream, I ran in the direction of the sound fearing for the worst ducking by window after window l was about to turn the corner into the maths corridor then stopped before the edge of the wall because I heard the worst sound possible at that moment

Chewing, against my better judgment I peered round the corner and saw the year 7 I helped being eaten by one of the zombies, I new better than to engage so I retreated to the gym and plugged in my phone then after what seemed like hours finally fell asleep. I just woke up am posting this now and will update soon.
