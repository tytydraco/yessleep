Everyone loves pulling pranks but nobody likes being pranked. And I hate it even more!  
  
Okay i used to have a sense of humor. But not anymore because of a cruel prank!  
  
So I was studying in my sorority dorm room.  
When I got a phone call from an unknown number.  
  
I answered the phone call. and I heard a goofy-sounding voice almost like a cartoon character. The voice said, “Is your refrigerator running”?  
  
I knew where this joke was going so I said ‘yes’. The goofy voice said, “Then you better catch it”. I did a fake laugh and said ‘That’s funny and hung up’.  
  
And then 10 minutes later. I received another phone call from another unknown number. I was kinda annoyed because I knew this was the same guy.  
  
I picked up the phone. and the same goofy voice said, “Is your refrigerator running”? I said ‘Yes it is still’.  
  
But instead of saying then you better catch it. The voice said, “Do you have food in there”? I was kinda confused because I didn’t know where the joke was going. So I said ‘yes’.  
  
and the voice still talking goofy said “what food”? I grabbed the phone and went to my fridge. I saw nothing but pizza.  
  
Sure it’s not a balanced diet but that’s what I had in the fridge. So I told the man on the phone ‘pizza’.  
  
The goofy voice said “You can’t cook pizza in a fridge” and I laughed for real that time.  
  
I then hung up and was about to go back to my desk to work. and I get another phone call from another unknown number.  
  
I was kinda annoyed so I let it go to message. but that must have upset that prank caller. because I saw a hammer crash through my window landing on my desk!  
  
I just let out a scream. And then another phone call. I answered it and ‘screamed at the guy to leave me alone’!  
  
The man said in a goofy but angry voice. “Don’t cut me off before the joke next time”!  
  
Before the guy went back to his happy goofy voice said “Is your refrigerator running”. I said ‘Yes it still is’!  
  
Then the man said “Do you have food In there” I said ‘yes Pizza’!  
  
The goofy voice said “That’s cool I use my refrigerator for other things” I was confused as to where this joke was going. But I knew it wasn’t going to be good!  
  
But I must have taken too long. because another window broke by another hammer!  
  
The voice on the phone was yelling at me in a far more angry but still goofy voice saying “You’re supposed to say what is in your fridge”!  
  
I said while sobbing ‘what is in your fridge’! The voice said now calm as if he wasn’t screaming his lungs out “I put Mostly just let In there”!  
  
I then sheepishly asked “What is let” " The goofy man said, “lettuce discuss this later”.  
  
Now I would have laughed at that joke. If I wasn’t in this situation.  
  
Then this time the man hung up. I waited for him to call me again. But instead, I got no new messages.  
  
I thought that he was done. But then I saw a man carrying a ladder and a garbage bag. Walking towards my window!  
  
I grabbed my phone dialed 911 grabbed a kitchen knife and hid in my bathroom! I was talking to the responder about what was happening!  
  
When I heard the man get inside my dorm room! He walked into my kitchen. Before coming to my bathroom door and began to start hitting it with a hammer!  
  
While saying “Is your refrigerator running”? I said in a completely distressed voice ‘Please stop’!  
  
The man yelled at me far louder and anger than before but still sounded like a goofy cartoon character “Your supposed to say yes” I then completely losing it said ‘yes’.  
  
then the man said, “Is there food in there”? I was screaming ‘pizza’! the man said far more unhinged than before “I just put Mary in there”  
  
And I screamed ‘Who’s Mary’? the man yelled in a joyful but still goofy voice “Your next-door neighbor is getting married”!  
  
And after that the bathroom door was about to give away. I could see cracks forming in it as he kept hitting it with a hammer!  
  
And as he was about to break down the door! the police sirens wailed in the distance!  
  
That must have scared the man off. because the hitting stopped! and the man left!  
  
As the police were talking to me an officer said that there was something in the kitchen!  
  
I turned to my kitchen. and saw my neighbor Mary beaten to death by a hammer in my fridge!  
  
I guess my refrigerator is running!
