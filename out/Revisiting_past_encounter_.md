I'm a 30 year old from Australia and the events began to take place when I was about 15 years old. My older brother who was 18 was dating a girl named Casey and me, my brother, and her were alone in the house watching a movie. It was one of the first times meeting her; we had a normal night, nothing strange happened. When I randomly heard a loud female scream in my mind, I was aware it was in my mind but had never experienced this before and it was strange. 

I looked around the room to my brother and his girlfriend with a worried look and she then said, "Can you hear it too?" I said, "I just heard a girl scream, did you hear that?" My brother said no and she said it was a lost spirit who died, she's scared and lost. 

I was a pretty normal kid, didn't think about much deep before this; I played rugby, hung out with friends, did normal stuff. When she said that, it scared me a lot. She then spent the next few hours explaining that she has dealt with this for years and that now I have heard this voice it would get much more intense and that I am a powerful old soul.

 She said she was into witchcraft and speaking to spirits and that she would always protect me and not to be afraid. We eventually went to sleep and the next day I woke up remembering just not being able to stop thinking about what happened.

A week or so later, me, my brother, and Casey were in his room hanging out when she went into a seizure state, shaking uncontrollably and speaking in gibberish. My brother was very concerned but I was very calm. She told me to put my hand on her and help her.

 I placed my hand on her leg and she stopped shaking and started breathing deeply, saying she was feeling something in the room that was reacting to me being there. Not much else happened that night but I did start to feel the presence of this entity in the room. It's important to add that the room my brother was in was a garage we converted to a granny flat for my grandfather who passed away in this room 2 years prior. 

Over the next few days, I started to feel this entity communicating with me as my grandfather. At first, it was very emotional and nice feeling, and I remember having it explain things that only my grandfather would remember about our last time together. Over days though, I did get a strange negative feeling from this thing. 

Some events that took place over the next few months are quite blurry but I remember Casey having some possession events like the seizures in front of me and she used me as a healer in a way. I never was scared for some reason and always remained calm, and she relied on me to protect her from these events. Eventually, we were on a trip with family at the beach when me, my brother, and Casey decided to use a ouija board. It was during a storm and there was a room that was kind of underground with a small window that was high up and on ground level of an outside area and a door into the room.

As soon as we started the ouija board there was a very intense feeling in the room and before we could even start asking questions the door knob on the outside of the door fell off and we heard it fall to the ground on the other side of the door, locking us in the room. My brother was panicking and I just said, "It's ok, I'll climb through the window and let us out." I did that and nothing else happened, we stopped the ouija but after that the entity that was acting as my grandad got very dark.

 It began to tell me that for me to unlock my full potential I needed to make a big sacrifice and eventually started to tell me I need to kill my brother. I had nightmares of killing him and writing on the walls in blood and had woke up feeling watched and was beginning to lose my calmness. Not long after, Casey broke up with my brother randomly and abruptly, leaving him in a deep depression. 

Me and my brother began drinking together a lot in his room and we had some very intense visits from the entity while drinking. My brother told me some of the things Casey would do, such as witchcraft rituals in the room, but my brother said he never had the entity speak to him but felt watched and felt it hated him. 

One night, me, my brother, and his friend Paul were drinking in his room having a fun night when I suddenly felt the entity in the room, and I saw Paul looking in that area I felt it and he suddenly began clenching his fists and breathing like he wanted to kill someone. I immediately grabbed Paul and comforted him; he started screaming at my brother, and after time of me calming him down, my brother said, "What happened?" and he said, "I don't know, I just got this sudden urge to hurt you." We then explained everything we had been going through to him.

I am skipping some other things that had happened through the next few months but essentially more of the same stuff was happening. Then one night we had my brother, Paul, and two of my brother's other friends over, Frank and Kate. I had a very dark feeling about Frank all night. It was my first time meeting him. After drinking, Frank randomly stood up and went towards a bookshelf with a box cutter.

 I knew that he was being possessed as soon as he stood up and as soon as he grabbed the knife I bear hugged him from behind and grabbed the knife in his hand, and Paul rushed over and helped me overpower him and we held him down. He acted as if he was calm but I still had the feeling of the entity possessing him but no one else felt that way. We all talked about what had been happening to us. This was a big thing for me because it proved that this must be real if three separate people now all had the urge to hurt my brother without them knowing anything prior. We all went to sleep and were awoken by Kate screaming; we woke up to Frank standing over her, masturbating. 

We all immediately kicked Frank out of the house and I started to talk to this thing and said, "What are you? I want you out of here. I'm not scared of you; you have no power over me." It said to me, "I am evil. I was Hitler. I am Aleister Crowley," which to me didn't mean anything. I told my brother that and he said, "That's that guy Led Zeppelin liked." From there, I researched Aleister Crowley and was having nightmares/astral projections of being in Aleister Crowley's house, looking for something and being followed by this entity. 

I was trying hard to get rid of the entity as it wanted people to hurt my brother; from what I could feel, it was jealous of my brother and loved Casey and wanted to have Casey to itself. We reached out to her but she stopped talking to us; this was about a year after the initial events.

Eventually, it began to become less intense and left us alone mostly, and I began to doubt it was even real and that I was just an imaginative kid. But over the next few years, I would get drunk at house parties or with friends and would get taken over by it, beating myself, smashing my head into doors and walls. It happened maybe 5 times over that 2-year period from 16 to 18 but that's really all. I then began smoking weed every day and stopped drinking. Over the next 3 years were just fun.

I then had a girlfriend at age 20 who was very negative to my life, making me depressed and anxious to the point of suicide. I was with her for 2 years and had nothing paranormal or strange happen; I had forgotten about that side of me. Then I met a friend at my job that was a Christian; his mother also worked with us and was a big member of her church. She eventually invited me and I said yes. 

I remember feeling a resistance in me from this entity but I ignored it, thinking I was just crazy; that didn't happen and wasn't real. I began to pray to God to get me out of this depression and I had two strange events happen while praying. The first was on a hike by myself; I asked for a sign that you're watching me and you're real, and I got attacked by about 5 birds at that exact time.

Then I was praying in the shower with my eyes closed and felt a negative energy and opened my eyes to see my girlfriend with her face pushed against the shower, looking like a demon. I screamed at her and she got really upset.

I then invited my girlfriend to my new Christian friend's (Reno) house; we were smoking weed when all of a sudden Reno's brother got agitated and pulled a knife on his brother. My girlfriend freaked out and wanted to leave; as we were leaving, Reno's father-in-law stopped us and said to my girlfriend she is no longer welcome in the house, she has brought dark energy into the home. She was furious as was I and swore at him. 

I got in the car with her to leave when I said, "No, I want to go talk to him; it's wrong they said they welcome everyone and then say you're not welcome." When I went inside to talk to them, the priest was there and came out of nowhere and said, "Leave, you're not welcome." It shocked me so much and I felt this intense electrical shock in my whole body and fell to the floor. I was shaking, sweating, and the priest, Reno's mother, and aunt all grabbed me and were praying and screaming, "Leave this boy, you're not welcome in his body." 

I felt this entity again for the first time in years; it was screaming, burning, and I felt it being pulled out of my body into Reno's mother's hands, and I was in pain, burning. I suddenly had this urge to lie to them to make it stop, so I acted that I was cured and began crying and saying, "Thank you so much, you saved me." We talked and cried for the next 30 minutes until I convinced them to let me leave. Once I left, I disconnected from Reno and never saw them again.

The next two years, from 22 to 24, were horrible, the worst time of my life. I became insanely suicidal, shut off from everyone. My girlfriend cheated on me at 23 and I got worse; broke up with her and had finally attempted suicide and failed. I then was so desperate to get better I left Canberra where I grew up and moved into a friend's house. Then I had the most amazing change; I stopped smoking weed, which I hadn't done since I was 18. 

I met my now current wife and from 24 to now at 30, I've had a normal life. I got a great job, got married, and 2 years ago had a kid. It has been a challenge as my daughter was born with a genetic condition and she needs a kidney transplant, and I will be her donor, which I'm in the process of now, but I am still happy with my life.

Nothing paranormal happened since I moved to Sydney, however, over the last 2 months, I started to feel drawn to it and began questioning everything that happened back then, realizing some events that took place cannot be explained away. Then about a month ago, I was randomly invited to a concert by my brother and Paul; I had not seen Paul for the past 8 years, and right before I saw him, I was listening to a podcast, and as I'm walking into the concert, the podcast starts talking about Aleister Crowley, which made me so confused. 

What are the odds of that? Then after the concert, my brother starts telling me that he has begun thinking about Casey a lot recently and feels her visiting him in his dreams. He's also married with a kid, and he has not thought about those events for years but was always very skeptical it was ever real and more just us being imaginative and drunk young teens. 

But he said he's been thinking about the events and felt the same as I've felt recently; that some things can't be explained away that took place. Since then, I've been drawn to the subject and have kind of felt this entity hanging around me, silently kind of just watching me, which is where I'm at now, just beginning to revisit these periods of intense strangeness. I never really talked about this with anyone out of embarrassment but want to be able to talk about it to see if anyone else has been through these experiences that may be able to shine a light on it for me. Thanks for reading.
