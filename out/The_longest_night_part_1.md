Do you remember? Please tell me there are others out there who remember the 19th of July.  
As the old legend goes (insert a long boring quote). Basically once in a very long time ancient creatures return to their real form. When I was younger, my parents conveniently used that legend to scare me to bed. As in " Go, go, run to your bedroom before some giant spiders can get you, if it is their turn to rule the night" Now for those of you who never heard the story of the longest night from your parents , you can read on and figure it out, or search for it online or something.  
On that day I was visiting my friends’ apartment ; a common skyscraper in the heart of a major city. As many normal individuals do for socialisation we were seated at a little Parisian style table on a narrow fully glassed balcony to witness yet another setting of the sun in between the surrounding us concrete jungle. I greatly enjoy those moments; as if the world pauses for a few moments just before the last of the glowing orb disappears from view. I can’t say that I remember what was the topic of our discussion. Maybe another freakish Jasmines boyfriend as for some reason the girl chooses people from the worst layers of the population to become her special someone, or maybe I was grumbling about my boring job and the greedy management. The point being that our conversation wasn’t very unique or entertaining when I noticed a subtle dark shape on a distant building, it’s outline highlighted by flaming orange rays. "Dude, look! There is like something on the wall of the new mall they are building!" I exclaimed pointing at the nightmarish creature from a fever dream. After I had some time to get a good look at it, I was more and more sure that I was either dreaming or tripping on something in the tea we were drinking. There was a human sized arachnid …thing crawling on the roof of one of the lower structures.  
"Jasmine, say that you are seeing that spider too. I think I’m going insane" I said trying to sound legit while questioning my sanity and sobriety.   
Somehow my friend did not seem at all moved and just said "Well that must be a mantropede"   
"A what ?!" I blurted. I always considered Jasmine to be well educated ; taking part in so many projects and receiving outstanding grades at our time in college, but I never thought of her as ‘science smart’.  
After a quick phone call to someone that I did not recognise. She casually rose from her seat and stated "We must go"   
" Go where exactly ??"  
"A safe place"  
"Why, don’t you think we’ll be just fine here. Away from everyone, you know — up above?"  
" When it actually starts, nowhere will be safe"  
With that, she was out the door and up the emergency set of stairs leading to the roof.  
Finally, when we reached the top floor, it was already crispy twilight. Red flashing lights positioned on long thin rods at every corner illuminated our surroundings, coupled with a blinding light of a helicopter that was waiting for us. The loud whooshing of the vehicle silenced the other sounds of the city below and made me slightly woozy. I’ve never been up close to one of these things, let alone flown in one!   
From there, we were whisked away to a ‘safe place’. While we were flying I still considered the rapidly occurring events to be a part of an exhilarating dream. Any rational person would agree that there was no way that spiders as large as people existed in real life! So it didn’t feel that I was in any l danger, not at all, instead I was in fact enjoying myself in denial. The building, or rather the fortress we were approaching was located on a small island surrounded by seawater. Don’t get the image wrong, it did and does not look like a castle, instead think of it as a mix between a presidential palace and a prison. All windows and doors there had nets or bars. Some passageways had double doors and for a moment I questioned if I was being led into a secret jailhouse. There was practically an army of guards positioned at every door and corridor. You see, everything mentioned above belongs to my Jasmine Wilsons’ family. Let’s just say, I didn’t know that my friend was that rich or that she had a secret life and history that she didn’t think of mentioning to me — her best friend which understandably left me irritated. When this was over we were having a talk I thought.  
A little while later I was taken to see the entirety of the five generations of the Wilsons, that I by the way had never heard of. I did have some knowledge on Jasmines’ immediate family as in her parents, which as I was told were in the sphere of business and worked oversees. The family didn’t seem neither hostile nor were they very friendly or should I say that they didn’t even acknowledge my presence next to Jasmine. They greeted her of course, while I seemed to be non-existent, excluding for one small girl that started to say hello, but was quickly hushed by her parents.  
The Wilsons crowded in a deem airy room that was tastefully decorated in the aesthetic of dark academia. Long leather sofas stood in the somber atmosphere bearing the weight of the majority of the family which were silently fixated on a flat tv that centred the living area. The large digital screen displayed horrific scenes from the city and the world we’ve just left. Indescribable things that were figuratively tearing the megapolis apart; fires blaring; people dying. I’m thankful that at least the device was on silent. Now here is where my mind reentered my brain, the reality hit hard. All of a sudden I was suffocated by fear feeling terrified and helpless. After a while though the slight fog from traumatic sights lifted slightly and I began questioning the safety of my family. I wanted to make sure that they were tucked away somewhere far away from harm. Unfortunately, in the hurry to leave my friends apartment taking my phone was not my priority. I accidentally left it right there on the table that we were sitting at. Stupid of me, I know. The problem still had to be solved however, so I asked to use Jasmines phone. Instead of the brand new iPhone I knew my friend had I was handed a burner phone, exactly like those weird things with buttons some movies show. Like who still uses them? Although following the events that took place earlier I decided that questioning another weird action seemed pointless. It’s not like anyone would tell me anything anyway. After a while at trying to reach my parents with it with no result I gave up. That feeling of dread in your chest when you aren’t able to do something important lingered, nibbling and pulling at my nerves. The rest of the family at this time was preoccupied by drinking wine and having quiet discussions between each other seemingly alike Jasmine, unfazed by the situation. What an eccentric family!  
I decided to get some fresh air thinking that it would help me relax.  
I was accompanied by a guard to the back door; the one that led out to a small pier as well as a beach filled with grainy sand and small pebbles. It felt rather unusual having a random person follow me around. The air outside was moist and fresh acting to slightly relieve the tension while keeping me fully aware. I slowly lowered myself on an upturned boat, my guard silently standing besides me, hand at his side — ready for action. But we are safe I though feeling the rough texture of blistered red paint on the weathered wood. What was this thing even doing here? I was sure the family has million dollar yachts or something so the little boat felt out of place.  
My eye caught movement far out in the ocean. Then a subtle splash followed."I think there is something in the water" I started to mention to the guard in a low tone when I was rudely interrupted by shriek coming from the sea. The dark mirror of the water all around momentarily filled with boiling activity. I being completely uninformed of how dangerous that situation was, stood transfixed on the creature slowly emerging from the water. How could I look away? In my mind I was witnessing a scientific discovery. All these years the stories about mystical creatures were true. The being had a slick fish tail covering the majority of its body which was almost glowing as the dingy moonlight reflected of its cyanic scales. It didn’t have arms, well it did have something resembling upper limbs as stereotypical mermaids usually posses in fairy tails, but they looked as though sea weeds were merged with thick slimy tentacles. It’s face or the lack there of was replaced my millions of minuscule shells. I hope they were sea shell as I couldn’t tell from where I was standing. So much so for chanting ,human-like sea people!  
The mermaid was steadily moving towards me and as it was doing so it started producing a sound that I would characterize as singing. A repetitive harmonizing whistle that almost had a hypnotic effect on my mind. All of a sudden, I had an urge to swim; to emerge my body into the cool waters; to follow my new acquaintance into the depths of the ocean. Then I was being yanked inside by the guard. My feet were soaking wet. What in the world? Did I enter the water?!  
Right before the airtight door shut, I saw a glimpse of the beach again, but now the mermaid thing was in the shallow water it’s head twisted at an unnatural angle in my direction!  
I suppose the creature understood that it’s song didn’t have much of an effect while we were behind a heavy metal door. It changed tactics, so instead of the melodic sounds it was now imitating people screaming and begging for help. Children, adults, the elderly, I questioned whether it was all the people it trickled into drowning or whatever it did to its victims that joined it for a swim.  
It’s now outside slithering in what I think are circles still screaming, as though it is baiting it’s prey
