In the dead of night, around 2:30 or 3:00 am, I found myself trapped in a nightmare that has left me shaken. Being a 20-year-old light-skinned North Indian man, I've always had a weakness for tall blondes - they're exactly my type.

The dream began with her - a beautiful, tall blonde woman beckoning me to follow her into a room. Something about her was irresistible, and being somewhat adventurous, I followed willingly. Once inside, the lights suddenly went out. Feeling bold in the darkness, I began removing my clothes, but that's when everything changed.

I caught a glimpse of her in the mirror and saw it - that smile. That horrifying, unnatural smile that stretched too wide across her face, revealing teeth that seemed too numerous, too sharp. A cold dread washed over me as a terrifying thought crossed my mind: what if she transformed into an elderly woman? I've harbored a deep-seated fear of older women since childhood, associating them with witches from the countless horror stories I consumed when I was younger. Junji Ito's "Fashion Model" certainly didn't help matters, with its grotesque imagery forever etched in my mind.

Her eyes never left mine in the mirror's reflection. They seemed to grow darker, deeper, as though they were bottomless pits rather than human eyes. The temperature in the room dropped suddenly, and goosebumps spread across my exposed skin.

Sensing my mounting fear, she darted into another room, moving with an unnatural, fluid grace that seemed almost predatory. Despite every instinct screaming at me to run away, my curiosity—or perhaps some darker compulsion—drove me to pursue her. The hallway seemed to stretch and distort as I followed, the shadows growing thicker with each step.

When I finally found her, she was standing right beside me, appearing without warning or sound. She flashed that same terrifying smile—too wide, too knowing. Then she began to laugh, her shoulders shaking and head tilting back in apparent mirth, but no sound came out. Her mouth moved in silent, mocking laughter, creating an eerily quiet horror that sent shivers down my spine. In that moment of voiceless laughter, her features seemed to shift and blur, as though her face couldn't quite decide what form to take. This silent display of impossible amusement was the final terror that jolted me awake.

I sat upright in bed, gasping for breath, my heart pounding so loudly I could hear it in my ears. The darkness of my room seemed alive, pulsating with unseen presences. After calming myself, I immediately woke my sister to tell her about the nightmare.

What's most disturbing is that I recall having a similar dream when I was younger—though back then, the woman had long black hair cascading down her back, not the golden blonde locks of tonight's apparition. In that childhood dream, she was merely present, watching from a distance, never engaging directly as she had tonight.

This transformation in her appearance has left me wondering if she might be some kind of shapeshifter, an entity that has been visiting my dreams for years, changing her appearance from black hair to blonde because she somehow knows my preferences have evolved as I've grown older. The thought that this entity might be adapting to match my desires, learning what form would most effectively lure me closer, is what truly terrifies me.

I fear that the next time I close my eyes, she'll be waiting, wearing yet another face—one even more irresistible, and perhaps, more dangerous.
