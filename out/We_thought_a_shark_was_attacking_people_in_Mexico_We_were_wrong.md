I was just about to shut down for the
night when the email came through.
The subject line read: "Urgent
Assistance Needed - Resort
Attacks in Cancun." My first instinct
was to delete it; marine predator
cases weren't my field anymore. l'd
spent years as a paleontologist, and
these days, I dealt with cryptid
sightings and the kind of cases
others laughed off. But something
made me open it.

The attached images hit me like a
punch to the gut. Corpses mangled
beyond recognition. Flesh shredded
and limbs twisted at impossible
angles. At first glance, I thought
shark attack. That was, until |
noticed the bite marks. They weren't
serrated like a shark's-they were
crushing and ragged, something far
larger and far stranger.

The attached images hit me like a
Punch to the gut. Corpses mangled
Beyond recognition. Flesh shredded
And limbs twisted at impossible
Angles. At first glance, I thought
Shark attack. That was, until |
Noticed the bite marks. They weren’t
Serrated like a shark’s-they were
Crushing and ragged, something far
Larger and far stranger. My heart
Raced as I scrolled through the
Evidence, unease settling over me
Like a second skin.

That unease turned to dread when
The resort manager, Jorge, called. He
Spoke in rushed, clipped English, his
Voice trembling. They’d contacted
Marine biologists, he explained, but
None could identify the attacker. He
Needed someone who could think
Outside the box. Someone like me.
Against my better judgement, I
Agreed to fly down.

By the time I landed in Cancun,
Exhaustion and dread were already
Pulling at me. Jorge was waiting
With dark circles under his eyes and
A nervous energy that infected the
Air around him. As we drove to the
Resort, he laid out the grim situation.
“There have been shark issues
Before,” he admitted, his voice low.
“But nothing like this. Too many
Attacks, too fast. Tourists are
Fleeing. If this doesn’t stop...” He
Trailed off, staring out the window.

At the hospital, the last surviving
Victim, a teenager named Manuel,
Lay pale and trembling in his bed.
His chest rose and fell unevenly, and
His lips barely moved as he
Whispered the same words over and
Over: “EI lagarto asesino.”
“The killer reptile,’ Jorge translated,
Looking skeptical.

Manuel’s words haunted me as we
Drove to the morgue. What I found
There turned my dread into certainty.
The bite marks on the victims didn’t
Just match something large-they
Matched something ancient. My
Fingers traced the jagged
Impressions, my mind racing
Through fossil records. Pliosaurus. A
Creature that hadn’t roamed the
Oceans for millions of years.
“Predator X” I said aloud, earning a
Confused look from Jorge.
“You’re serious?” he asked.
“Dead serious,” I replied. “Whatever
This is, it’s real, and it’s out there.
You can laugh me out of here
Tomorrow, but if we don’t act now,
Someone else will die tonight.”

The patrol boat was modest, but it
Bristled with harpoons, rifles, and an
Unsettling number of explosives.
The crew’s unease was palpable as
We set out under a starless sky. I
Tried to tell myself it was just
Another job, another predator, but
Deep down, I knew better.
I must have drifted off at some
Point. The first jolt woke me with a
Start, the ship groaning under the
Strain of something massive. Shouts
Echoed from the deck as men
Scrambled for weapons. I stumbled
Into the chaos, just in time to hear a
Scream pierce the night.

The spotlight swept over the waves,
Catching brief glimpses of a man
Being dragged through the water, his
Screams muffled by the ocean’s
Roar. Then he was gone, swallowed
By the darkness.
The ship lurched again, violently this
Time, sending men tumbling to the
Deck. Something was pulling us,
Dragging the boat like a toy. The
Crew fired into the water, but their
Bullets might as well have been
Pebbles.

It struck again, bursting through the
Deck with a roar of splintering wood.
For a brief moment, I saw it-
Monstrous head with teeth like
Crushing blades, its eyes gleaming
With ancient, predatory malice. Then
It was gone, leaving chaos in its
Wake.

Water flooded the ship as it began
To break apart. I stumbled into the
Navigation room, spotting a box of
Dynamite and a flare gun. My mind
Raced. The ship was lost, the crew
Scattered, but I wasn’t going to die
Without a fight.

The ocean at night is a black void,
Indifferent and unrelenting. I clung
To a piece of wreckage, the screams
Of the crew around me fading one by
One. Something brushed past me in
The water, and my stomach turned.
A half-eaten body floated by, and I
Realized it was my only chance.|
Shoved a stick of dynamite into the
Corpse’s tattered shirt, gripping the
Flare gun with shaking hands. Then
The water churned beneath me, and I
Saw it-rising like a nightmare from
The depths.

Its jaws opened wide, rows of teeth
Gleaming as it lunged. I kicked away,
Firing the flare into the corpse as the
Creature swallowed it whole. The
Water erupted in a deafening
Explosion, a wave of heat and gore
Crashing over me.

When the silence returned, I clung to
The wreckage, my body trembling.
The rescue ship’s lights finally
Pierced the horizon, but I couldn’t
Shake the feeling that something
Was still out there, watching from
The deep. Waiting.
