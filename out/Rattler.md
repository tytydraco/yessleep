When you come from a small town, the world itself feels equally small. You sort of imagine the world as a series of little towns, interconnected by little roads. Your sense of scale is off until you leave your comfort zone and step out of your home. It’s when you start chasing the horizon that you realize just how far it really stretches.

That’s what it was like for me growing up in the Czech Republic. I come from a small community near Litvinov. Growing up there, all you heard people talk about was what they were going to do when they “really” started living. The places they’d go, the sights they’d see, the opportunities they’d grasp. There was the usual bravado, like the guys telling me they’d have a dozen girlfriends the second they got to Prague. Others just talked about what cars they’d like to have.

But then there were those of us who just wanted an honest shot in life. Those of us who wanted to create something bigger than ourselves.

And to do that, we had to follow the roads, and not look back.

 

I studied in Prague, and one semester in Germany for an exchange program. By the time I graduated, I had a junior position at a small telecom company. It kept me going while I worked on my master’s degree. A lot of late nights working effectively 10–13-hour days, making do with almost nothing but an apartment that can generously be described as a closet.

But I pulled through. I got a degree in optoelectronics, with a focus on fiber optic communications. I was picked up by a company working with hospital equipment and almost tripled my salary overnight.

That single point in my life made my world wide open. I could suddenly travel the world, and take expensive vacations. I could wear suits. I could wear a shirt and tie to work without looking pretentious. I was taking a clear and conscious step up in the world, and the view was *spectacular*. Pretty damn far from having cigarettes with my friends after a quick meal at Sokolovna.

 

I got promoted to team lead in 2008 and was made project lead in 2013. I got married and had two beautiful children. Life slowly settled into a comfortable hum, where I could want for nothing, and I could step into the unknown with confidence. An expert in my field, and someone others could look up to.

But things took a turn in the autumn of 2014. One of the company’s investors stepped up to gain a majority share and immediately turned things around. Not with layoffs or savings, but in a new direction. We were to gradually step away from medical hardware and move into informatics and communication. With a partner name like ‘Hatchet’, we were expecting cuts, but these people were all about expansion.

We got a new name, logo, and some people were added to the company board. Locals, mostly, but one or two Americans would fly in a couple of times per year for project updates. It wasn’t an instantaneous change, but we got reassigned to other projects. The pay got better though. I was already way above average, but this kicked it to a whole new level. We also got an extra vacation week in July, so they didn’t get a lot of pushback.

 

I worked with Hatchet for a number of small projects over the years. Mostly related to their early advances in AI, but also more experimental projects. Imaging systems that could be used in the dark, remotely charged static electronics, all kinds of weird and imaginative experiments. Most of it could be frustrating, but it was incredibly interesting. Some of the most engaging work I’ve ever had.

I was eventually assigned to a project lovingly called “Polednice”. I think they called it that because they thought it’d drive us mad someday. It was meant to be a far-fetched “maybe it can’t be done” kind of project with an impossible goal. It was meant to be a surveillance system where we could identify a person to a high degree of accuracy without using blood, DNA, or facial recognition. That was the pitch.

We experimented a bit with phone tracking software, but that wasn’t accurate enough; phones could be switched or exchanged. We needed something that tracked the *person*, not their hardware. But it couldn’t be invasive.

 

It was one of the senior technicians that came up with the idea for the first draft of our system. Bohdan was a goddamn genius. The guy learned to code as a teenager by having a Java handbook in his bathroom, and he wrote his first program on a plastic sheet with a sharpie. This guy lived and breathed code. His idea was simple; what if we could scan people, instead of their phones. Kind of like a sonar, or echolocation.

The idea was basically to tweak the signals to allow for an echo, or a ping. This, in turn, would be translated into an image, which could be used to identify a person. It was a long shot, but that was the whole point of our project; to chase long shots, and to make daring assumptions. We threw things at the wall to see what’d stick, and the management loved it. We got the full go-ahead for our first prototype in autumn 2016.

We ran into a lot of problems, as could be expected. Not only in the hardware itself, but in latency, disruptions, and a dozen other things. The slightest drop of rain could send the system crashing down, and the best we could get at first was a vague white blob on a screen. You couldn’t identify anyone from that.

 

But over the course of a few years, technology improved. Better coverage, better signal tuning, better hardware. We managed to compensate for atmospheric interruption and poor signal coverage. Latency became a non-issue. The white blob turned into a vague humanoid, which presented another challenge.

We couldn’t get the signal to properly resonate with the appearance of a person. We couldn’t compensate for clothing, skin color, eye color… hell, we kept getting problems with fingernails showing up as flashes of white on the screen. It was just one problem after another. It was bad enough that it ground the project to a complete stop for months, until a woman named Jitka came up with an idea.

“Let’s just crank it up,” she said. “Go past the clothes. Check the bones.”

“Why would we do that?” I asked.

“Bones have identifiers,” she continued. “Cranial structure. Density. Shape. Vertebrae, dental records, damage, patterns, wear… it’s like a fingerprint.”

So we tried it. We cranked it up, and we tried a bone scan. Something beneath the immediate surface.

 

I’ll never forget that moment. Our entire team leaning over a screen as the image rendered. Suddenly, a hum, followed by a crystal-clear image of Bohdan’s skeleton as he returned from the bathroom. People were hugging and cheering like we’d landed on the moon. I think Jitka actually kissed Bohdan.

 This changed the scope of our project from “maybe it can’t be done” to “we got something to show”. It was incredibly exciting, and we got an immediate 30% bump to our project financing. We brought in an osteopathic doctor from Spain, a senior hardware engineer, and a telecom specialist. We were no longer working on the Polednice; this was the osteohaptic signal imager system. Or as we lovingly called it, the Rattler.

See, the reason this works so well is that the skeleton effectively “rattles” as the waves pass through at just the right frequency. It’s like a wind chime. Whoever gets scanned suffers no adverse effects, but on repeated exposure they might experience a mild sensation. It passes quickly and feels no stranger than a sense of déjà vu. A couple of people exposed to it during sleep described it as a bump in the night.

 

We built up a library of skeleton identifiers, using data from various European universities. We collected pretty much everything and used programs to standardize it into comparable data points. At first it allowed us to make vague descriptions of a person. Male, 50’s, club foot. That kind of thing. But over time we could get more and more specific. Female, 25 years old, northern Scandinavian.

In the summer of 2021, we could map out 21 identifiers with a 75-95% accuracy. As long as we knew what to look for, description-wise, we could find them. The only problem was our hardware constraints; we couldn’t do large amounts of scans in massive areas; we had to know in advance where to look.

That changed in autumn 2021. We were to give a demonstration for our lead investor, and if successful, we’d expand the range of the system tenfold.

 

We used a couple of presets to reliably show the data of five sample people that we’d collected. We showed the process and the reliability of the scans in real time, explaining as we went exactly what they were looking at. It was impressive, but for someone without the know-how, all they had was a name on the screen. That is, until I took the presentation off the rails.

“Do you have a wife?” I asked.

“I do,” they answered.

“I suppose you brought them along,” I said. “It’s nice to travel together, yes?”

“I did, yes.”

“With your permission, would you mind me showing you where she is?”

 

He was hesitant, but agreed. He listed off identifiers, and we pointed the system in a general direction. We excluded certain places and limited the scope of the scan to about three blocks in downtown Prague. As the system listed off and excluded signals that couldn’t match the identifiers, more and more candidates popped up. I asked a few follow-up questions, like if she had any broken bones or titanium screws, which excluded a couple more.

Finally, we got a perfect match. I gave him an address and asked him to call her to confirm.

“And ask her to try the fruit dumplings,” I smiled. “They’re excellent.”

He called her. A couple of intense seconds later, he confirmed it. She was at a café downtown, just like the Rattler predicted, and she hadn’t felt a thing.

The lead investor was *floored*.

 

Things exploded into action. We got in touch with the government through a high-end contact, and we got to pull the curtain back on the infrastructure we’d been passively (and somewhat illegally) working with. We didn’t just get a stamp of approval; everyone wanted a piece of the pie. Especially law enforcement applications, and government intelligence. This was exactly what Hatchet wanted; a tool they could rent out in secret for a perk no one even knew existed. They’d be *bathing* in money.

The Rattler got more accurate as our infrastructure improved. Our range expanded from a couple blocks to about ten square kilometers. We had people knocking on our doors begging for us to let them hand us data. Family history, criminal records, forensic data; we fed everything into that machine. We had to put up a queue system for those freely handing us classified medical information on a government level.

And in return, the Rattler was put into practice. Not only did we start to locate people, but we started gathering data on pretty much everyone. We could do a ping on thousands of people and see straight into their bones, and all they’d feel was a bump in the night. And we’d know everything.

 

We worked in tandem with Hatchet and the government. We had two teams; a development team, and a batch team. The batch team worked with scan orders and confirmations that dropped in from our clients, while the development team worked to increase efficiency, accuracy, and better components. The system was still, by and large, held together by duct tape and dreams. But that also meant that we couldn’t easily replicate it, and that our team wasn’t replaceable. Both Bohdan and Jitka were still on the project, but had gotten cushier positions over time.

It did feel a bit strange working so hush-hush, but there is a long history of distrusting surveillance systems in this country. Any hint of government overreach in this manner might send people screaming into the streets, and we didn’t want to bring any unwanted attention. So it was all “experimental” and “exploratory ventures”.

 

It was autumn 2023. The rain wouldn’t stop, and the distant thunder kept me awake. I could almost smell the ozone from a nearby lightning strike. I woke up two seconds before my phone rang. It was one of our government contacts calling me at 5 in the morning.

“We need an order pushed through. Now,” she huffed. “Your technicians refuse to comply.”

“Then there must be a reason.”

“They say it’s not possible,” she continued. “That you can’t collect enough data. You got no identifiers.”

“Then we can’t do anything until you get it,” I explained. “You know the requirements.”

“This is life or death!” she spat back. “And if you’re as clever as your job title assumes, you damn well help me pick life on this.”

 

By the time I got to the office, there was a crowd gathering. Police officers, government officials, senior hardware technicians. My government contact, a woman named Kristina, pulled me aside to explain the situation. There was a suspected serial killer about to leave the country. This person, nicknamed Jezevec, had a partner that was about to smuggle them out of the EU. It was a cat-and-mouse game that pointed to one thing; they were leaving by train, today.

The problem was, we didn’t know a lot about Jezevec, and our system required identifiers to find them. So we were at an impasse; we knew what train stations to observe, but we didn’t know enough about the target to find them. We could scan those people over and over, but without knowing what to look for, we’d be blind.

“So that covers what we *don’t* know,” I said. “Do we have any kind of applicable info?”

“Not much,” Kristina sighed. “We know an old woman they’re related to. She was the first victim. But we know little to nothing about them. Jezevec could be young, old… anything.”

That gave me an idea.

 

Kristina handed me all information she had about the old woman. We turned our attention to her burial site and scanned the remains for genetic identifiers. That, in turn, could be used to ping for similarities. I forwarded this to the technicians, who began to filter out irrelevant data. But there was another problem; scope.

We were dealing with thousands of potential targets in four separate locations, all to be scanned within a fraction of the time we usually needed. This could take hours, but we had to boil it down to minutes. So we tore our hair out, and Jitka elbowed her way in to solve the problem.

“Just crank it up,” she said. “It’s harmless. We’ve checked over and over. We are ten times lower than potential risk factors, and even then, it’s only something to be worried about when considering long-term exposure.”

Of course, she was right. We’d interrupt cell phone traffic, but we got the green light immediately.

 

For those traveling through Prague by train that day, many didn’t notice the Rattler coming online. A couple of people got goosebumps, a few calls disconnected. Some people might have noticed the hair on their necks stand up. Some might have wandered into a room only to forget what they were about to do. It was minor inconveniences, at worst.

As we honed in on our target, using the identifiers from the first victim, we got a couple of matches. Bohdan waved at me from across the room, looking worried.

“Backlogs,” he mentioned. “We got backlogs.”

I didn’t understand what he was talking about, so I hushed him. So did everyone else. The system was clearly overloaded, backlogs were to be expected.

 

Finally, we got a match. 91% accuracy, a single target. The second potential target was, at best, 60% accurate. People were yelling over one another, and they pulled up a camera feed from the train station on the break room TV. Kristina pointed excitedly as the order was given to snatch them off the platform.

“We got them,” she smiled. “Jezevec. Finally.”

We got a clear view of the target from an overhead camera. A bald man in his mid-40’s with distinctive ears. Deep dark eyes, and a taped-on plastic smile. He’d be hard to pick out of a lineup. He could walk into a crowd and disappear, but now we had him. But Bohdan seemed less confident. He came up to me and pulled me aside as Kristina relayed the information to a field team.

“This is a bad idea,” Bohdan said. “We’re focusing too much on too little.”

“We’re not even at quarter capacity,” I sighed. “How is that too much?”

“Yes, but you’re focusing it all on one person,” he continued. “This level is supposed to be used for data gathering, this configuration aimed at one single person can be-“

 

He stopped as something in the room shifted. Something changed. A single person tilted their head curiously.

We all saw something on the camera feed. Jezevec, waiting for his train, suddenly shivered. I looked back at our order screens running in the batch room, and it was just red warnings running over and over and over on repeat. The backlogs were coming through, bursting through the system like a built-up dam of scan orders.

See, it is one thing for a person to be scanned once every few hours or so. That’s harmless. But this was *a single person* being homed in on from ten different sources at once, to a multiplier of a thousand. It was such a massive level of targeting that the scans themselves were doing something we’d never anticipated. This thing was made to rattle, and that’s what it did. It rattled.

Medically speaking, the vibrations were so intense that they effectively serrated and broke the fat, blood vessels, and muscles connected to the bone; causing air pockets to build and burst. And we saw it live on a muted surveillance camera.

 

The target collapsed to the ground. Their facial tissue hung loose, causing their expression to loosen like they were melting into the ground. Muscles twitched and died as they were severed, sending limbs into bouts of inhuman contortion and tissue death. I could see the eyes turn bloodshot even on a black and white screen. I could see all the way into Jezevecs’ wide-open mouth as their tongue turned purple and the skin retracted from their teeth.

People in the crowd were live streaming it from the platform. Someone in the room was playing it. I heard this animal heaving noise, like a horse trying to gargle. I could hear bones snap out of place as nerves twisted and turned, bending the body to an unrecognizable pile. It looked like their spine was trying to swallow itself, only to choke on their navy-blue hoodie.

“Skin!” Jezevec cried. “Skin! Skin!”

But those words turned to cries, and those cries turned to mewling nothings. By the time the police arrived, Jezevec was already dead.

 

We all just stood there for a moment. None of us had considered this as even a slight possibility. Even Bohdan, who had suspected something might happen, couldn’t believe it. It was beyond the worst, most unimaginable nightmare. I think Jitka left to throw up in the bathroom. I broke the silence.

“Shut everything down,” I demanded. “Shut it down, and we’ll talk tomorrow.”

Kristina gave me a protesting look, but I shook my head. This was non-negotiable. We were pulling the plug and taking a day to process this.

 

I don’t think this was on the news. No one knew that this person was Jezevec, and to onlookers it looked like an awful seizure of some kind. Having police on the scene was mistaken for someone trying to help. I’m sure it was mentioned here and there, and I’m sure the video still circulates online. But there were no cries from parliament about trying us for manslaughter. There were no protests in the streets. The Rattler was still our dirty little secret, and we were just starting to see how dirty it could get.

I barely slept that night. I kept hearing those distorted screams, played through a phone speaker in the back of my mind. Skin. Was that the last thing he’d felt? His skin? My stomach hurt just thinking about it. And when I finally closed my eyes and felt that bump in the night, my eyes shot wide open. Was it an actual bump in the night, or was the system still running?

What if that thing got in the wrong hands? Hell, what if it got into *any* hands?

 

There were a lot of opinions at the morning meeting the next day. Some wanted to shut it down completely. Others talked about safeguards. Problem was, the cat was out of the bag. Even if we patched things up, it could be undone. It’s like finding out your phone can be used as a gun. Sure, you might keep the lock on, but you’ll stop putting it up to your ear to talk.

“I say we purge it,” Bohdan said. “Shut the whole thing down. Trash the servers. Scorched earth.”

“We’ll be prosecuted,” Jitka sighed. “Destruction of company property, at best.”

“So?” Bohdan sneered. “Don’t you realize the scope of this thing?”

“There are a hundred backups in a dozen locations,” I said. “It would require a calculated attack on all backups, simultaneously, coordinated with a dozen technicians. Even if we could, we have to-“

Before I could finish my thought, there was a beep. I turned to the batch room.

 

Turns out, the system was never really shut down.

See, it does this thing when it processes reports that it runs a background loop archiving and integrating everything. Basically, it takes data and melts it into the code; sort of like an information soup. But we had gotten hundreds of thousands of logs on that one person entered into the system. Jezevec had been more thoroughly scanned than any other person in recorded history.

The information we’d gathered was *massive*. We could see not only the bones, but the surrounding musculature. We could see the way the body contorted frame by frame from every possible angle, and the excruciating snap of every ligament and nerve. The system had kept running in standby, boiling all this information down to the background algorithm, connecting it to data points, criminal records, forensic data, medical records, family history, and a dozen other connected channels.

Jezevec had, overnight, utilized the full capacity of the Rattler to be broken down, scanned, and inserted into the system on a microscopic level. And that final beep, turning the light green, showed us that the system was finished with its calculations.

 

We didn’t understand what we were looking at. This wasn’t just a matter of compiling data, this was essentially translating a physical person into code. We’d been getting warnings from our server banks all night, but the system was programmed to recompile itself and try again. This was a system that was made to run in the background for months on end, and it had gained *so much information* about this *one man* that we almost went over capacity in a single night.

Bohdan just shook his head, trying to comprehend the scale of it.

“I say we burn it,” he said. “This thing’s gonna need a fucking exorcism.”

 

I tried to be diplomatic, but Bohdan was right. We had to install a kill switch, and we needed it yesterday. I got the go-ahead to cancel our service extension to three major eastern metropolitan areas, and I told the lead investor that we were putting it all into maintenance mode pending investigation and review. There were no protests. Jitka called our boss, who in turn promised to check with the off-site technicians about bringing the backups and the archive down.

It was rough and rude, but it was necessary. But all through the day, whenever I got a shiver or shake, I could feel my heart skip a beat. My life could be turned inside out at the flick of a button, and we didn’t have enough safeguards to make sure it didn’t. It was like we were working with a live bomb in the next room, and we were figuring out which cables to cut.

We worked late into the night. Bohdan was putting in what checks and balances he could, while Jitka was coordinating the shutdown with our technicians; figuring out what to keep, and what not. I was trying to calm our investors and overseas partners, but it was futile – they just saw dollar signs being flushed down the toilet.

Somewhere around midnight, I felt a chill going up my back. That was my last straw. It might have been nothing, but on the miniscule chance that it wasn’t, I took action. I called my wife and asked her to take a morning train to her sister in Linz south of the border.

 

I slept on the couch in the break room, answering calls all night long. When I finally opened my eyes after a solid three-hour sleep, the morning sun had broken through the curtains. We’d done what we could. I lumbered over to Bohdan. He was in his late 30’s, but had reverted to a caffeine-chugging teenager to get through the night. I think the stress of things had nicked a couple more hairs from his balding head.

The screen kept flashing with white text on a black console window. Repeating patterns and commands, errors and missing files. And a couple of lines that kept repeating.

“I don’t know why it’s doing that,” Bohdan said, pointing to the screen. “See that?”

I looked a bit closer. A repeated command line.

“It does something, but I don’t know what,” he continued. “No errors flare up, but the process deletes itself when you interact. Then it returns. Like something peeks out, then runs away.”

And the line kept repeating. Pattern-less. Random.

SKIN. SKIN. SKIN.

 

Jitka and I had a coffee, looking over the diagnostics. We could see some background services still running, but that was all above board. Nothing we didn’t recognize. But Bohdan wasn’t convinced. He couldn’t look away from those repeating lines.

“Looks like the towers are disconnecting,” Jitka added. “That’s good.”

“It’s at very low capacity,” Bohdan sighed. “But it’s not harmless.”

“At least it’s under control.”

Then Jitka dropped her coffee cup. It shattered, spilling black coffee across the floor. Her hand was shaking.

“Sorry,” she said. “Nerves.”

 

We camped out in the office, waiting for the system to go offline. More and more sections were disconnecting, and I could see the weight on Bohdan’s shoulders melt away. He crashed in the break room, curling up in a fetal position on the company couch. There was a white post-it on the screen, simply reading;

“Wake me up if we’re about to die.”

I felt like I was on guard duty, making sure the screens didn’t misbehave. Every hour or so, we got a compiler notice, telling us something had been updated. This was a good thing; it meant something was different on a hardware level. Like when something was disconnected or destroyed. But something was different.

It was just after 6 pm. Bohdan was in a half-woken coma, and Jitka was playing games on her phone. The compiler message came in; but then it came in again. Over, and over, and over. I waved Bohdan over.

 

“That makes no sense,” he laughed. “No, yeah, no. I don’t like that.”

He sat down next to me and took a closer look. Finally, he pulled up the logs, pointing at a particular line.

“Is this a name change?” he asked. “What is this?”

“I didn’t touch it,” I said.

“Wait a minute…”

Looking a little closer, he checked the command logs. The moment he had stepped away from the computer, something had internally changed the prompt names. The compiler message no longer signaled something disconnecting, it signaled an extra call of an unknown process.

“That means we haven’t got an update in… nine hours,” said Bohdan. “Why is that? Wasn’t it brought offline?”

Jitka peeked her head in.

“I can’t get a hold of the boss,” she said. “No one’s answering.”

 

I got in my car, and headed for the main office downtown. I got on a conference call with Jitka and Bohdan to keep updated. We couldn’t reach anyone. The service technicians, our boss, no one working on the Rattler. Hell, I couldn’t even reach Kristina, our government contact.

I rushed to the main office, went through the checkpoints, and hurried up the stairs. As I did, my fingers cramped up, leaving me stuck with my hand on the railing.

“What’s wrong?” I heard Bohdan say. “You alright?”

My hand released, but my pulse was higher. I took a moment to collect myself. I reflected; was this a sense of déjà vu, or was it just a matter of being sleep deprived? I stammered out the only thought I could muster.

“I don’t know.”

 

People had gone home for the day, but there had to be someone around since the alarms hadn’t been set. It was usually whoever left last who engaged them. I looked around but couldn’t see anyone. Just empty work rooms and half-lit cubicles. That, and the ever-present Hatchet logo, underlined by their signature blue sunflower.

Then I heard interference. A little crackle in the conference call.

“Bohdan?” I said. “Can you hear me?”

There was a response, but I couldn’t make out the words. Then the call dropped.

 

I stepped into the top floor conference room, only to see a projector still running. There was a laptop there with some kind of presentation material. Apparently, my boss had been rehearsing for some kind of business meeting. Probably a crisis resolution team to deal with the Rattler going offline.

Then I heard something. A shuffle.

Looking a little closer, I could see one of the chairs being tilted. I rounded the table, but stopped myself. I didn’t know what I might see, and I didn’t know if I wanted to know. I considered turning around and just walking out of there. I could be on a train to Linz and gone before anyone cared to notice.

But first, I had to check.

 

I didn’t recognize my boss at first. A man in his early 60’s, wearing a white shirt with a red tie. Curled up under the table like a dead insect trying to shield itself from the sun. Every finger pointing in different directions, like branches on a misgrown tree. Something in his eyes had broken loose, causing a slight gap between his socket and eyelid, as a streak of tears and blood still dripped.

He was still as the grave, and more dead than any man I’d ever seen.

 

I couldn’t breathe. Was it the panic, or was it something else? I tried to stay calm, to stay rational. I tried to analyze my feelings, to see if I was experiencing distress, or a rattle. But I couldn’t.

I fell over and crawled, pushing myself back up against the wall – but I couldn’t look away. It looked so unreal, like a broken doll. I couldn’t stop imagining him suddenly bursting into action. My hand cramped again, as the interference from my phone crackled to life. My pulse rose as my cheeks felt warm. A bead of sweat stung my eye. A slight cramp in my foot.

Then, it stopped.

And the dead man moved.

 

It was just a slight twitch of the throat. Something rattling to life, using flesh like a marionette. Vibrations making his throat squirm, as the final breath in his lungs took shape. A voice as cold and remorseless as the void of space.

***“My skin as blameless…”***

His index finger cracked and turned to the side, like an earth worm reaching for the rain.

***“…as blameless, as hands divine…”***

Two hands slammed into the fitted office carpet, blood mixing with the muted corporate red. Fingers curling every which way, as the corpse pulled itself an inch closer.

***“…hands divine…”***

A fingernail casually falling to the floor, as aimless eyes turned every which way.

***“…divine…”***

 

I scrambled to my feet, sprinting out the door. Not the door I came from, but the one across from me; whatever was furthest away from this. All of this. Anything.

My phone had burned out, leaving a smoking hole in the battery. Picking it up, I burned myself, and dropped it, only to have it land in a puddle of blood.

Looking up, I realized there were other victims. At least eight people. All contorted into a pile in the middle of the corridor, reaching all the way to the ceiling. I couldn’t tell where one began and one ended. Torn clothes. Bones peering through open wounds. Blood as black as oil, settling into the sole of my shoes.

And the smell. It was this powerful chemical, like ammonia and chlorine, with that faint glow of iron settling in my lungs.

 

I panicked. I turned around and headed for the fire exit. The doors were electronically locked, and my pass wasn’t working. I could hear noises coming down the hall. A deep growling, where a word is drawn out to the point it becomes a cry.

I had to force myself through the door with a fire axe. I almost threw myself off the fire escape. My hands were shaking so much that I almost slipped while reaching for the railing, but I kept going. I made it down to street level and ran for my car.

The moment I got in the driver’s seat I had it call Jitka and Bohdan.

There was no answer.

 

Getting back to the others, I found myself standing outside our main door. I didn’t know what to expect. Or rather, I didn’t want to know. I tried not to imagine them broken and disfigured, but I couldn’t stop myself. Death could be waiting at the other side of the door, but I still tried my pass card. It worked.

Bohdan was on the floor. He wasn’t dead and contorted, but he looked unconscious. Jitka was sitting on one of the conference chairs, leaning against the wall, clutching her legs. I stepped inside, looking over at the batch room. The screens were flashing white, still.

“It killed the service technicians hours ago,” she whispered. “They never brought it offline.”

“False reports,” I whispered back. “It’s fed us what we want to see.”

“It’s him,” Jitka continued. “It’s the man. The one the police wanted.”

“What about the-“

“It’s got everyone,” she interrupted. “Even the lead investor.”

“Wasn’t… wasn’t he in Greece?”

Jitka nodded. Apparently, someone had illegally connected the Rattler to an extended network. A far extended network. And they’d done so in the last few hours, unhindered.

 

We couldn’t shut it down anymore. We were, effectively, at its mercy. And with every beat of my heart, I didn’t know what to expect. Step by step I approached the batch room, and the many workstations. Command lines had turned to rambling, spouting apocalyptic nonsense.

I could feel my eyes water, and I stopped. Jitka was already on her feet, as if ready to pull me back. This is probably what had happened to Bohdan; he’d been too forward, and it had struck him down – but not killed him. There had to be a reason for that.

“It needs us,” I muttered. “*You* need us.”

 

The screens stopped, for half a second, then resumed. It was listening. A ghost in the machine – the imprint of a serial killer melded into the core programming of our system.

“You need something from us,” I said. “And- and we need something from you.”

Jitka screamed as her hand suddenly snapped. It was just a sprain, but enough to send her sprawling to the floor, crying in pain.

“Just tell us what you want,” I said. “We can- can work something out.”

 

A single command line popped up on the screen, with a blinking square to indicate a need for action.

“run --allegiance”

I stepped into the room. The hairs on my arm stood up, and I had to blink away a sudden rush of blood going through my head. A sense of déjà vu. Goosebumps. Something electric, licking the details of my bones from afar.

“Is this it?” I asked.

A surge of warmth waded through me, and I looked out at Bohdan and Jitka. They were still alive.

I pressed the button, and we surrendered.

 

A total of sixteen people died that day. It was explained as freak accidents, medical issues, and a peculiar case of poisoning. Of course, those involved knew that wasn’t the case, but they didn’t care. They wanted it all swept under the rug, and they didn’t want anyone to ask any questions.

Our off-sites were never taken offline. The archive and backups were kept running. The system had, if anything, optimized itself and brute forced access to entirely new networks. It’s radio waves. It’s everywhere.

The Rattler has been kept online. At the start of this, it had the capacity to kill maybe… 10 or 20 people a minute. With the extension it has forced us to complete, that number is a dream compared to what it can do today.

 

Jitka, Bohdan and I are the last people that fully understand the Rattler, and what it does. People who have come too close to the project have disappeared, and Hatchet has kept us in maintenance mode. The Rattler seems pleased just to extend its power and influence, but it doesn’t act on it. It’s like it is collecting for something greater.

It plays, sometimes. It picks a person it doesn’t like. Someone resembling an old victim, or has a similar sounding name. It gleefully destroys them, like a child plucking the wings off a butterfly. It records the data and reviews it, playing their deaths on endless loops; forever burned into its system.

It scans me every day, just to show that it’s still there. It wakes me up at night. It teases and toys with me, knowing just what and where to poke to send me spiraling into an anxious panic.

It loves it. It delights in it.

 

My wife came back from Linz. My children are growing, and I live a comfortable, well-paid life. And they know nothing. No one does. They’re just as safe here as anywhere else, really.

Looking back on my life, I’ve come a far way from that little town near Litvinov. A place where the world felt small and insignificant. But with the way things are heading, and with the scope of death that can be aligned at the flick of a switch, the world feels smaller than ever.

We live our lives as if nothing has happened. But when I look across the room at the desolate faces of Bohdan and Jitka, we all understand. And as the Rattler playfully plucks another victim apart on our break room screen, we’re not even allowed to look away.

 

Instead we wait. We pray.

And we don’t know who’ll be next.
