I don't know where else to turn-animal control came by the other day and sped off in tears after taking one look at the thing.

Couple years ago, I moved down south to a humble little town settled near the wetlands. Nice place, small population, close enough to society so I don't go insane.

The head of the HOA-was surprised to find this town had one actually-gave me a grand welcome speech and a small set of rules. Basic stuff: don't litter, don't feed the wildlife, no major noise complaints, don't feed the wildlife, secure your garbage from pests and of course- don't feed the wildlife.

Now I grew up in the mountains of New Hampshire, I was no dumb yank thinking it was ok to feed Yogi table scraps. I don't think he meant anything by it either- but the heavy gentleman really wanted to get that last point across. Really rubbed me the wrong way, so I've kept to myself for the most part.

Recently we've been hit with a massive heatwave-I'm talking 110-120 degrees a day. The humidity has been sky rocketing; the air is so muggy you could cut it like cake and eat it.

Lucky for me-I have a pool.

20x40 in ground with a depth of 15 feet at the end. When the wave hit, I spent every waking hour either hunched over in my office with the A/C cranked or lounging in the perfectly kept 65-degree water. 

Needless to say, the neighbors despise me. They have to contend with rinky-dink kiddie pools and barely functioning central air. We live right at the edge of the marshland, not too swampy but wild enough that occasionally something with four legs would wander in-hell sometimes even slither in. My neighbor, Ricky, once found a reticulated python curled up in his garbage can.

That was a memorable trash day.

But we've never had any major problems with the wildlife-until three nights ago. It was 10pm-I was parked on the couch next to my gorgeous girlfriend Laura. She's three years younger than me but she already has so much of her life together.

I get by on a hefty inheritance while she works her ass off trying to get through college. She wants to be a marine biologist-a side effect from living her whole life next to a beach.

We were curled up in front of the TV-being bathed in the warm glow of prime-time television. I've been trying to get her into some of the all-time classics.

Though as her face grew pale and sickly as nazi prisoners sodomized each other-I probably should have started with a lighter program. She pulled away from me as a wheelchair bound inmate began to spin around and wax philosophy. 

"Sam this show is so tone death." She moaned.

"Awe come on- I don't complain when we're watching your shows." I bit back. 

"Yes, you do." She countered. She had me there of course. Laura had bi-polar taste when it came to TV; somedays she wanted to watch some reality trash, the others a mind numbingly long nature doc about whales or penguin migration. I could stomach the trash but my god there's only so much you can learn about penguins before you want to blow your brains out.

She made her way over to the kitchen counter to fix herself a drink. She mumbled something else to herself, some unheard backhanded thing that would have caused a blowout I'm sure-so I chose to ignore it. Laura brushed her tawny curls out of her face as she passive-aggressively slammed a glass onto the marble counter.

To her back was the sliding glass door that led out the yard. The pool lights were dim-yet stood out like a beacon among the steady dark. You could barely make out the mini tiki hut tucked away at the pool's edge-the pride of my yard really. From outside you could hear the droning hum of cicadas in their relentless symphony.

Sheepishly- I got up and shyly attempted to make peace. I leaned on the counter-it felt as cold as her shoulder. I averted my gaze as I attempted an apology.

"You're right-like usual." I offered. She paused mid pour. The coke flowed into her icy glass as she burned her corneas into my face. 

"And like usual you're deflecting from the real issue. This isn't about that stupid show, and you know it." Her voice was venomous; she'd fit right in with the snakes in the wetlands. I winced at her words- my mind gazing back to the fight we had earlier in the week.

 "I thought we got past that." I uttered. She scoffed as she poured a splash of rum in her drink.

 "No, you just decided we were done talking about it-you've spent this whole week acting like nothing's wrong." She pressed.

 "Laura, I told you-it isn't a good time for me; I've been swamped at work-the economy is so tight right now I can't afford two people living here." I explained. 

"You "work" from home and you have a trust fund-what bills do you think you're paying." She barked at me.

"Uh-the pool, the 300$ rum you're guzzling right now, the 50-inch flat screen-" I listed. 

"Why don't you just admit you don't want to commit-I graduate in three months, just rip the band-aid off now!" Laura cried. Her voice cracked as she did and I was instantly flooded with guilt. "We've been dating for two years Sam. It's starting to feel like a waste."

She turned away from me and looked out to the yard, drink in hand. I heard a muffled sniffle as I stewed in my guilt. I love her-shouldn't that be enough? If she moved in, I'd have to change up the whole decor, my whole routine. It just wouldn't flow right.

Besides she was going to be off the whole summer on an internship so what would be the point. I swear I think she's just picking fights, so I'll beg her to stay. Still as I watched her silently gaze out the glass door-I felt a twinge of regret.

I saddled up behind her, trying to find the right words. She leaned into the sliding door, squinting as she did. I tapped her shoulder and she squeaked out a gasp and twirled around to meet my gaze. She pointed out to the pool-gripping her rum and coke to her chest as she did. 

"Sam there's an alligator in your pool."  She motioned to the dark. I groaned in annoyance and peered out as well. At first it was hard to tell what I was looking for, the tikihit looked untouched, grass trimmed neatly; then I focused on the pool.

There was a long shadow sulking in it-this bulky, mishappen thing floating there in the deep end. It was big-from inside I guessed about 15 feet at least. There was this hump dead center in the thing-about five feet in an arch. I couldn't make out any markings or colors-but on either side of the gator were these piercing green eyes.

They seemed to glow in the night, a haunting monster lounging in MY pool. It wasn't my first gator-they're worse than deer down here- but something about these eyes unnerved me. There was thought behind them, like it was watching us back.

I opened the sliding door and was smacked in the face by the humid night. I tiptoed out and Laura grabbed my arm. 

"Sam what are you doing?" She hissed at me. I broke away and spoke at a low whisper.

"I just want to get a better look at it. He's basking-won't bug me if I keep my distance." I calmly explained. She darted her eyes back to the lounging creature.

"Be careful- I think there's something wrong with it." She couldn't take her sight off that bizarre hump on the thing-like a ridged arch almost. I shook my head and stepped closer. The grass felt cool and moist under foot-you could almost hear the squelch with every step. A few feet and I was stepping on tiled stone, the "beachhead" tiki bar overlooking the base of the pool.

I had set up all the bar stools and tiki decor near the deep end-so I could get plastered and just dive right in. Makes for some fun parties. My only light was the low pool LEDs lining the sides. They casted a thick shadow on our guest-but up close I got a better idea of the size.

It was 20 feet easy-slim but leathery skin gripping to it. Those light bulbs never left me-I could feel the gator drilling a hole into the side of my head. I was fumbling under the tiki bar-searching for the deck light switch.

It was a swanky set up I had; Christmas lights embedded around the roof and four flood lights on any corner. When I finally switched it on-the tiki bar burst to life with ravenous energy. The backyard became flooded with sparkling illumination.

It then quickly became apparent the thing in my pool was not an alligator.

I was met with this massive square snout-rows of pointed teeth sprouting out in a faux smile. The thing was brown and scaley-stripes of lemon yellow painted its ridged back. The ridge ran all the way down its tail-which swayed in the water like an eel.

The monster was keeping itself afloat with massive trunk-like hindlegs with three pointed talons that looked like they could easily slice me open. Its maw was flat-loose skin folded in on itself like a gular fold you'd see on a croc's neck.

That's sort of what looked like- a mutant crocodile on steroids. The creature blinked-and three eye lids folded back to reveal reptilian eyes-lime green around the slitted iris. Its arms were folded near the chest, meaty looking paws that looked like they could maul a bear.

I stood there safely behind the tiki bar-ignoring the fact that all that was between me and this monster was wicker and cheap plaster. There was this awful smell surrounding it as well-like a swamp full of sweat. For what seemed like eons we just locked eyes with each other, like we were trying to figure each other out.

From the bowels of the beast, I heard this guttural snore. It emitted a low bellow-a warning maybe. I backed away slowly, and the monster unfolded its arms. It grabbed the edge-each of its six fingers at least a foot long and ending in gnarled black claw. It slowly began to pull itself out of the pool-water sliding off the beast's hide with ease.

It didn't break its gaze on me once. I looked around-there was nothing to defend with besides poorly made barstools. The gaping maw slowly opened-the monster bellowed at me-this reptilian hiss that sent shivers down my spine. It had dragged half of its body out when I snapped out of it and booked it back to the back door.

The monster lunged, throwing itself onto the tiki bar. I didn't look back, but I heard a deafening collapse as it shattered the tiki bar under its weight. The lights snapped off-enveloping me in inky dark. My only saving grace was the beckoning backdoor-a glorious beacon among the blackness of the pit.

Laura opened the door for me-I bolted in as she slammed it shut. The sliding glass rattled and wobbled like it was going to collapse. I ran into the counter- a wild eye on me. I twirled around to see my pursuer had given up almost immediately.

It slunk back into the cool of the pool, dragging a trail of broken wicker and tangled lights with it. It swam around for a moment then went back to basking in the moonlight-those emerald embers shinning in the dark.

I caught my breath as Laura studied the creature, curiosity overtaking her like a cat in heat. 

"Laura get away from the door." I harshly spoke. She stepped back slightly, barely listening to what I was saying. She turned to me-eyes lighting up like a child on Christmas. 

"Sam it's a dinosaur!" She squealed. She was practically leaping up and down in awe-dare I say she was giddy. She seemed oblivious to the fact the thing had nearly squashed me. I saddled up next to her, disdain for the beast striking my face.

"Laura, that's impossible. It's a-mutant or something.  Crocodile got into some industrial run off or something." I muttered, more to convince myself than anything. The dinosaur bellowed in the night-like a low-grade foghorn.

It seemed satisfied that it had chased me off and was just- chilling in my pool now. Laura pointed out the ridge and started raving about it.

 "Look at that arc, almost a perfect 180." She whistled. "It probably wandered in from the marshlands. If it's hot here I can't imagine the sauna fuming out there."

"Laura please just get away from the window-what if its hungry and decides it wants a midnight snack." I spoke, realizing how frail and smashable my six hundred-thousand-dollar home was. I ran around the house like a mad man, switching lights off and drawing blinds.

Laura was following me around like a puppy dog and yapping like one as well. She had her phone out taking pictures, talking about the "greatest discovery in history" and "She would call her marine bio professor in the morning."

That last bit seemed like a dig to me-that was the guy who was dragging her away on a three-month internship in the Atlantic. She was blinded by childlike wonder-meanwhile I'm the one who actually came face to fang with that thing.

Course I wasn't going to let her go out and experience the wonder for herself-that would be a shitty thing to do. Instead, we hunkered down in my room with all the lights off and waited till morning.

I didn't sleep a wink that night. My bedroom is on the second floor-decent sized room and there's a massive bay window looking out into the backyard. I get a nice view of the yard- the hulking cypress and strangling vines, looks like something out of *Jungle Book* sometimes.

I laid in bed like a coward-watching this creature just swim gently around the pool. At times it brayed out into the night-and to my terror I realized I've heard that mournful groan before. There have been times late into the night where I'd be sitting at the tiki bar in a drunken haze and I'd listen to the midnight loon calls and the swamp symphony.

I'd hear thunderous cries and rapid chirps-like a hawk scatting to itself. I'd sit there and think "*Damn that's a big gator*." Fireflies would swirl around to match my vision-and I'm beginning to think some of those waltzing orbs weren't fireflies. Some of them stood in place-stalking spheres that always seemed to linger but disappeared in a blink.

While I was crashing out-Laura sat cross legged by the window taking notes like she was on safari. Around 4am I passed out-and only awoke to the searing sunlight crossing in. I sat up to find Laura was gone, and the pool was empty. I'd chalk the whole thing up to some fever dream-but that wouldn't account for my tiki bar laying in pieces and the wicker debris floating calmly in the pool.

I raced downstairs-calling out to Laura. I heard her arguing with someone in the kitchen as she was packing up her purse. Her phone was glued to her head as she rummaged around for something.

 "-No Brian I- you saw the photos; you know me why would I make something like this up? Well, it was dark I- no I'm coming now I just can't find my keys. Alright I'll talk more when I get in." She hung up on Brain as I cleared my throat. She looked up, excitement having not left her face since midnight. 

"Oh, good you're up. There's coffee on the stove- I got to head to class I'm in a rush. Keep an eye out for our friend just-be careful ok Sam?" she leaned in for a quick peck on the cheek before I could get a word in.

"Wait-that's it? What about the giant lizard in my yard?" I whined, not a proud moment I admit.

"Call me if it comes back-I saw it lumber off into the swamp around 5- I think it's hunting." She oozed fascination with it. "That was Brian- my professor. He's-skeptical obviously but I think I can convivence him. This is huge Sam-It could make my whole career." 

"That-that's great." I stammered, half happy for her, half terrified at the prospect of the dino coming back.  "But what if it does come back? I don't have a gun or anything-what if it tries to break in?" I whispered. She scoffed at my fear and went towards the front door after finally fishing her keys out. 

"I did some research while you slept-as long as you keep your distance it'll leave you alone. You've lived her two years without incident-if it's been out there at least that long it would it would have attacked by now. It's just hot." She shrugged her shoulders-completely dismissing my concerns. With that she waved goodbye and drove off in her jeep, leaving me alone at the door.

I spent the morning texting her "updates" as I cleaned up the mess it left in its wake. I say updates but really, I was just telling her I was ok and making sure she wasn't freaking out in secret. She was taking the whole thing way too easy in my opinion.

I think she's a thrill junkie- I took her scuba diving for our first-year anniversary and some sharks showed up. Everyone else in the group nearly drowned each other trying to get back on the boat but Laura?

She kept her distance, but she was all in-she was so graceful-dancing around the fined menaces like it was nothing. When I finally pulled her out of the water she complained and wanted to keep going, started going on and on about shark bite statistics and how they "never really bite" and "You were more likely to get mauled by a moose then bit by a shark."

I love her but she's nuts when it comes to stuff like that. Me personally? I'm perfectly content staying in and watching the game-brew in hand. Anyway, I started cleaning up what was left of the hut, I was also sweating like a pig and nervously watching the tree line.

My mind was screwing with me; I was jumping at every little shadow and call echoing out from the swamp. Any time the bushes moved I'd freeze and raise a piece of cracked wood in my hand like a club.

I don't know what I thought I'd do against it but if I could jam the thing in an eye socket it would buy me sometime. By noon I had collapsed onto a beach chair- I had raked most of the fallen wires and stuff out of the pool and I just wanted to relax.

Unfortunately, God wanted to fuck with me personally- because it was that moment I heard thudding coming from the swamp. The tree line parted ways as the dinosaur emerged from the swamp. In the midnight sun I was able to get a clear look at the thing.

It was more wide than tall, only standing a few feet off the ground. The ridge gave off this brilliant yellow hue as the stripes traveled down the dino's spine and up its head. It formed a downward arrow at the base of the skull, pointing up the duck-billed maw. It was supporting its weight on all fours, talon-like arms caked in mud and what appeared to be dried blood.

The undercarriage of the dino was stone white and Scalley, like the belly of a croc. Its chainmail like scutes were too numerous to count, but varied in their shades as it traveled the length of this hulking beast. In its maw it carried a fresh kill- the bloody body of a whit-tailed doe lay limp in its grasp.

It was secured in a vice grip yet carried gently-like it didn't want to waste any part before it could safely eat at its den. The beast slumped forward- dipping a painted claw in the shallow end. It cooed like it was delighted and threw itself in pointing its maw to the sky to keep the well-earned meal dry.

It began to chew and chomp at the bits-a dog with his bone. I heard what was left of the deer's skeleton crack and splinter as the dino snapped its jaws-eager to spill the meat down its gullet. I turned away, grimacing as it feed.

I was halfway between the pool and backdoor-I'll give Laura this, she was right. The dino was completely ignoring me. Granted it had a fresh meal now. It swam to the edge of the deep and rested the deer carcass on the pool deck.

It raised itself up like it carefully, like it was sitting down at the dinner table, and grabbed each end and tore into it. I could hear flesh peeling away from shattered bone as it gleefully had its fill. Even as it feed- I could feel its emerald gaze out of the corner of its eye. Like it was daring me to try and take the meal.

Instead, I took my chair and scooted further away. After it was done it left what little remained to rot on the grass- and pulled away from the edge. It lazily drifted in the pool, aimlessly basking in the heat. It took notice of me once and-growled, I think. At least that's what I think that low guttural bellow meant when I tried to resume clean-up.

It also raised its log of a tail and splashed down-spraying me with ice cold water when I got too close. I jumped back and gasped, those icy droplets burned my tanned hide. I gave up and started to head back inside.

That's when I noticed a beige bucket hat bobbing up and down past the fence. My neighbor Ricky poked his head up and leaned over, a friendly smile etched on his fiery red face.

 "Morning Sam! Lotta commotion this morning everything-" He paused as he took notice of the leviathan lounging in the water. I thought he would take off screaming but instead he whistled at it in admiration. "Well, I'll be damned-ya got Lucile in your yard. Awe that's quite an honor friend." He offered. I Looked at him slack jawed. I ran up to him, frantically pointing at the monster evidently named "Lucile." 

"Rick, you look at that-that thing and then look me in the eyes. You're telling me that's normal?!?" I shrieked at him. He simply shrugged. 

"Been a few years since she roamed this far in-but it's just Lucile. She's harmless-all things considered. Didn't Wayne give you the rundown when ya first moved in?" he offered.

I recalled when the head of the HOA- a portly balding man who I vaguely remember being named Wayne- trying to give me a packet and explain some stuff. I assumed it was just a list of dues I'd pay later and by that point I was tired and rundown so I kind of kicked him to the curb.

In my defense I was really hungover and jetlagged, had a lot of unpacking to do. Hadn't heard a peep from him since. Like I said I tried to keep to myself-have a lot going on and I travel a lot for work.

I explained all this to Ricky who got a weird look on his face. He sheepishly stepped away from the fence and mumbled something.

"What was that?" I snapped at him.

"Nothing Sam. Listen don't worry about Lucile-it's this damn heat its drawing all sorts of critters out of the woodwork. I got something mussing around my birdfeeder as well-know what I mean?" He hinted. I was drawing a blank to be honest and stood silent.

"I'll give Wayne a shout and see if he can swing by at some point-he can probably explain it better than I can. You have a good day then buddy." he flashed that southern charm at me than swaggered back to his house.

That was a couple days ago-and I am at my wits end now. "Lucile" has completely taken over my yard-she leaves animal carcass lying around, she lumbers around in the pool all damn day and night, and she snaps at me when I go near her.

I'm half tempted to lure her back into the swamp with a pile of sirloins or something like that-because I want my damn pool back. I told animal control there was a "croc" because who would believe it otherwise right?

Like I said before they came and ran almost immediately. No one in the neighborhood seems bothered by this, in fact I've had people try to come behind to get a photo of her like she's a novelty act. People go in Rick's yard, and I see them peering over the fence like peeping toms. I tell them to get lost and they get mean and snarky.

Am I the asshole here?

Everyone is just acting so damn nonchalant like this is an everyday thing its driving me up the wall. Laura has been texting me non-stop, bugging me for updates on what she's doing. She's stuck at her dorm for the rest of the week but every few minutes I get text from her.

It's kind of nice actually, we haven't talked like this in a couple months. I just wish we were talking about literally anything else. I'm not interested in where it came from- I just want to keep it out of my yard.

Wayne is supposed to stop by tomorrow and break it down for me but I'm not holding my breath for any quick solutions. I'll update if anything comes up but for now-does anyone had any ideas on how to reclaim my yard from this frigging dinosaur?
