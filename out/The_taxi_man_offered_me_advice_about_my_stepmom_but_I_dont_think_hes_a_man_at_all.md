It was like I’d never been away. Except for when I had to go home. 

“Strange. King’s Taxis aren’t answering,” I said.

“They went out of business. Here, call one of these,” the manager said, holding out a plastic pot full of business cards. I pulled out a worn one and dialled the number. Ten minutes later, I waved my restaurant colleagues goodbye and stepped into the night.

A long grey sedan waited on the forecourt, and I climbed into the back, opting to sit behind the passenger seat. The driver didn’t bother to confirm my name or my destination, but he was heading in the right direction, so I settled into a tired slouch and looked out of the window at the vague shapes of barns and houses I’d walked past earlier.

“Good shift?” asked the driver.

Startled, I sat up and addressed the sliver of ear and temple I could see. “Yeah, thanks.”

“Busy?”

“No. Not really.”

The driver turned onto the narrow lane which climbed up to my village, and I again looked out of the window into inky blackness. 

“Busy enough for there to be a need for you, though.”

“Well…yes.”

Inside the cab was just as dark as what lay outside, but in the rearview mirror I could see a smooth forehead and dark eyes pitted deep in their sockets. They flitted away and back onto the road as I met his gaze.

At the next junction, he took a wrong turn.

“Sorry, you should’ve gone left there,” I said.

“This way is better. I promise,” he said, voice vaguely accented. Every time he spoke, it seemed to alight on a different region. German–no. American. Or is it Polish?

I kept quiet as he drove to the opposite end of the village, did a full lap of a roundabout and headed all the way back to where he’d gone wrong, continuing on. I glanced in the rearview mirror to again find him looking at me. His mirthful eyes shifted away. 

At the bottom of his seat, where the backrest met the cushion, something was moving. I frowned, wondering whether my eyes were tricking me. But in the fleeting light of a streetlamp, I saw the ghost-white fingers of a hand wriggling like maggots on a corpse. Stunned, I checked to see where the driver’s hands were, and saw them both firmly gripping the steering wheel.

“Here she is–our sleeping beauty,” my step-mom said the next morning as she leaned over my dad to pour him some coffee. He blinked as she stood upright again, giggling, before returning to his newspaper article. No amount of cleavage was going to distract him from a piece about the measures being taken by the automobile industry to reduce their carbon footprint. That was my dad–inert and unmovable. Steady as a battleship anchor.

“Morning,” I said, directing the word at my father. 

“Morning, love,” he grunted ‌between slurps of coffee.

“Is it?” asked my step-mom.

“Is it what?”

“Is it still morning?”

“Yes.”

“Only just!”

I ignored her and reached for a cereal bowl.

“What are you doing?” she asked.

I paused. 

This was how she operated, and it seemed she hadn’t changed her ridiculous habits while I’d been away studying. What she wanted was a trial. My dad would be the judge, I would be the defendant, and she’d be the prosecutor. Any time she deems that I’m taking liberties, she pecks me into submission and forces me to ask my dad whether I could indeed charge my phone or do my laundry or use some of his toothpaste. Not today, I thought. 

I reached for the cupboard where the cereal was kept, grabbed a fistful of Kellogg’s Frosties and threw them directly at her face. I then put the bowl away, shouldered my handbag and left for work.

The Saturday shift was always busy. And long. We work from midday to nine-p.m in the restaurant before the manager sends us to the function room, where a wedding reception is invariably taking place.

In the small hours, after we’d finished clearing up, I searched for a different taxi rank to use, but the manager informed me that this new firm had established something of a monopoly while I’d been gone. I *could* use a different company, but the wait time would be considerably longer. I yawned and looked at my watch. If I called the same cab rank as the night before, what would be the odds of the same driver turning up? Extremely slim. And my bed was calling me. I dialled the number.

I swore under my breath when I saw the long grey sedan pull onto the forecourt. Foolishly, I got in.

The driver regarded me with eyes that didn’t exhibit the same level of shock as his voice did. “It’s you!”

“You drove me last night, didn’t you?”

“Yes. How nice to see a friend again. Did you have a good shift?”

“I did. It was busier.”

“Ahh. There’s no better occupation for a troubled mind than busyness.”

“Who says I have a troubled mind?”

“Everyone has their troubles,” said the driver.

I sighed, thinking of my step-mom. All of my troubles seemed to be coming from her at the moment.

“What does she do to bother you so?” asked the driver as he turned onto the narrow lane.

I felt his eyes boring into me through the rearview mirror and realised that I’d spoken my thoughts aloud. 

“She’s jealous of me. Wants my dad’s attention but can’t fathom that he can love us both. Nope. In her tiny little mind, there just has to be a winner and a loser. So she makes my life a misery in order to compete in a competition she can never win. What kind of father, if it really came down to it, would choose anyone else over his children?”

The driver was pondering this as he took the same wrong turn as the night before.

“You should’ve gone left,” I said.

“Ah! My apologies. I can be such a silly billy sometimes. I was thinking about your predicament, and it occurred to me that your step-mother may benefit from a fright. Have you considered this?”

The driver swung his head around to look me straight in the eyes as the car hurtled towards the roundabout.

“If you shout loud enough, she might listen.”

As he spoke, his neutral, ageless face began to change. His ears sank into his skull and became mouths. His eyes and nose did the same. All the while, the car remained on a collision course with the roundabout.

“Look out!” I screamed.

With his eyeless face still peering back at me, he handled the car as well as any experienced driver might, and did a full lap of the roundabout. 

Then another. 

And another. 

He accelerated, laughing while the centrifugal force pressed me against the car door. A huge tongue slapped out over the bottom lip of his mouth–his original mouth–and his enlarged uvula pulsated deep within his throat.

Without warning, he screeched off the roundabout and turned back around in his seat. I wiped tears of terror away to find him sitting upright and with a head that looked perfectly normal.

“Well, you have my advice,” the driver said, and dropped me off.

I didn’t sleep well that night, but I must’ve drifted off at some point because I woke to a gentle knock at my bedroom door. Groggy and disorientated, I peeked through a gap to see my father standing awkwardly outside.

“Morning, love,” he said.

“Morning. Is this about yesterday? The Frosties?”

He nodded. “You know it was wrong.”

“I know. I’m sorry, it’s just her–she drives me mad.”

My dad pursed his lips and said nothing. His eyes were sad.

“I’ll apologise,” I said and closed the door.

I found her sitting primly on the sofa, her back straight as a plank. A pair of red glasses perched on the tip of her nose as she knitted what looked to be either a frog or a crocodile.  

“Hey, I’m sorry about yesterday. It was uncalled for,” I said.

My step-mom sniffed. “If you were sorry, you wouldn’t have done it in the first place,” she said.

A slug of molten iron twisted in my belly, and my heart began to pound. I wanted to grab her throat and scream in her face. To take back my apology and tell her what I really thought of her. But then I remembered the taxi driver’s advice had been to do just that, and he didn’t seem like a good person to listen to. I turned and took a stiff step away. Then another.

It turned out that Screaming Sundays were still a thing. Sundays were the most popular day of the week for families to go for a meal out, and families meant children. Little bundles of chaos that sit like royalty in their high-chairs shrieking and bawling and shouting and crying. 

I was on edge, understandably (I think), and so whenever a child cried out, I found myself wincing. Several colleagues asked if I was OK. They said I looked paler than usual. I told them I hadn’t slept well, which was true. I didn’t tell them about anything else that had happened the previous night.

To get home, I opted to use the other taxi rank, even if it meant waiting longer, so I hopped up onto a barstool and ordered a Coke with my twenty percent colleague discount.

“Hey, your phone,” the bartender said.

I looked over and saw that I had two missed calls. A red minivan flashed its headlights at the front of the restaurant.

The driver must’ve pressed a button as he saw me approach because the side door slid open automatically. He was a kindly Sikh man with an elaborate mustache who took the time to confirm my name and destination before gently pulling out onto the main road. I breathed a sigh of relief. The distance between us was too great for smalltalk, which I was glad about. 

We turned onto the narrow lane and began to climb, albeit slowly. The minivan juddered as the driver shifted gears before making smooth progress again. 

However, not everything stopped shaking. Something wriggled at the bottom of the driver’s seat where the backrest met the cushion. The darkness was too thick to see anything, and the next streetlight was a quarter-mile down the lane. I heard a small scrabbling noise, and in the next fleeting moment of illumination saw a pale white hand scuttle down the neck of the driver’s shirt.

The fingers of the hand clutched the back of the driver’s throat before becoming gelatinous and flattening out across his skin.

“S–something’s on you,” I whimpered.

“Hm?” said the driver as he reached to scratch his neck. 

The hand-thing detached a piece of itself onto the back of his hand and set about consuming him. He yelped and jolted the wheel to one side, then the other, and I screamed. There was a wet choking sound as the driver’s body became something amorphous and hardly human. It turned to look at me with its head of open mouths. Unseeing hands drove us down towards the roundabout.

“DID YOU SHOUT? DID YOU FRIGHTEN HER?”

“No!”

“WHY NOT?” asked a mouth where an ear should be.

“WHY NOT?” asked a mouth where a nose should be.

“WHY NOT?” asked all of the other mouths, one at a time, as the driver spun the minivan around the roundabout at such an outrageous speed that the van threatened to lift onto its two outer wheels.

“My dad loves her!”

“YOU HAVEN’T BEEN A FAITHFUL FRIEND. YOU DIDN’T TAKE MY ADVICE.”

“We’re not friends! Let me out!”

The driver shrieked and thrashed, pounding the steering wheel with fleshy hands, but the van appeared to be slowing.

“Let me out! Let me out! Let me out!” I begged, and the driver’s feet twisted madly out of the footwell to kick against the windscreen. I took my opportunity and slid open the door, bailing out onto hard tarmac, numb to the gravel which had embedded itself in the heels of my palms. Bolting down an alley, I left the minivan to drive in circles with one of its doors lolling open. 

I sprinted all the way home, getting stung by nettles and pricked by brambles in my efforts to avoid roads at all costs. The first opportunity I gave myself to rest came when I’d locked my front door behind me. I slid down to the floor, panting. I looked at my bloodied hands and torn clothes, and then up at my step-mom who was standing in the hallway horrified.

“I’m not even going to ask,” she said, before turning to climb the stairs.

Every time I even *think* about a cab, I feel sick. Yet, I can’t conceivably, as a lone woman, walk three miles in the dark to get home after work, so what should I do?
