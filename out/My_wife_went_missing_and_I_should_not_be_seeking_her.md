I experienced a pretty dark day. My wife went missing after staying with me for 15 years, and just disappeared when she took a walk with her dog, Fortune. But she never came back. One hour, three hours passed, and the whole night passed.

I began to worry about her getting lost, but her car key and car were still on the table, and it was supposed that the wolves’ habitat was still 50 km away from this peaceful town where we knew each other well. I thought of a kidnapper. I tried to call 911, but the police just dismissed it after they searched for 3 days. Later, they marked it as simply a missing person case.

Other nice people in town also tried to help me, but we couldn't find any remains of my unfortunate woman, a pitiful woman with a warm heart, or the dog. My heart was not only broken, but also shattered beyond repair. At that instant, I felt I had lost the idea to live, almost.

I began to search around my town. I took the torchlight, followed the memories, the places she might love to walk alone. At this time, I still had the lightest hope that she might have just gone missing by herself, still waiting for me somewhere outside town.

I knew about the forest and the trails around town very well, perhaps. I was calling her name when I went deeper and deeper into the forest outside town.

I had already left the main trail that folks used to take for a walk. I didn’t care. I swore that if I couldn’t find her, I would never end searching. Until suddenly, my feet hit a stone. I took a look. It was a brick. There was a black, smoked thing in front of me. A school.

There was a very old school that had been abandoned 20 years ago, but I never had any memory of this school, even though I lived in this town for many years. But suddenly I had something in my mind that seemed to urge me to explore the abandoned school.

What if I might find my lover here? Even though the hope might be faint, it is not impossible, I thought.

I entered the walls, which had already fallen and become broken bricks. There was a fountain at entry, but already dry. Far over, there was a broken path directly to the teaching buildings. Plants had already occupied most of the campus. It did not surprise me much.

But at the end of the path, among the line of classrooms, there was one that did not seem to have been affected by grasses and branches. No roots were going inside. It seemed someone cleaned it? I thought and entered with curiosity. It was already turning dark when I reach the end, why is today turning dark so fast.

When I entered the broken door of that classroom, I found it had been totally smoked, as if by fire. I was stunned. The inside of it seemed never changed, totally new, no mold, no plants, no sign of any living things might have come after it had been abandoned.

Although I felt strange, I still kept entering, kept exploring. The power source seemed already broken. The switches were just gone. But… but light. Were they on? The lights seemed to work.

“It is impossible!” I thought. “What was the power source for this light? It had already been abandoned for at least 15 years!”

I went deeper, going outside the range of the light. I had to use my torchlight to scan the surroundings. Everything seemed badly preserved compared to the area covered by light. Chairs were already broken, their legs couldn’t support anything. Desks were covered with mold. The floor was already broken or full of dust. Really, nothing surprised me here.

I walked to the last line of the classroom, using the torchlight to scan each inch of the space carefully. There began to appear books and papers, covered in dust. I took a look at them, using my fingers to flip them carefully, and tried to read them.

There were just notes, symbols, and very rough drawings, childish. Perhaps this was just someone’s math class before, I thought, reading those notes without much attention.

I found a piece of paper which seemed surprisingly new, not covered in any dust. Wait, but I never saw it before when I found this deck of paper, I thought. It was strange.

I began to read it. At the start of the note on this paper, it was written in a mess style, but seems familiar:

“I love you so much! We used to be here. We cleaned this classroom for you. We can stay together! We are staying here, always, when you are reading this. We are watching you. We used to watch you.”

“What the heck is this? Someone loved to sit here, perhaps just some messy stuff left by the boring guys who visited here, but why was the writing similar to my wife” I murmured.

“Are you sure?” A voice suddenly appeared in the darkness behind me, hoarse, but scary enough to make me freeze and unable to move anymore. I felt my blood run cold. I began to turn my head, slowly, painfully, to my back.

I moved the torchlight slowly, inch by inch, through the classroom, until it moved to the place where that small piece of light illuminated. But this time, I found it was not the light itself. It was a tall, skinny humanoid figure standing in front of the classroom. That light without a power source was just located—or I should say, grew—at its head.

The figure moved its head when my torchlight pointed at it. It was so tall that it already reached the upper floor, but still might bend its waist. It seemed like a terrible combination of a human and a giraffe. Every move of it was cumbersome but still full of flexibility, and its ankles worked in an unnatural way.

“Are you sure?” It spoke again, but this time in a female voice, which seemed familiar to me.

“Laya’s voice?” I thought.

“C...o…r…rect!” it said.

“Wait, you can know my mind?” I suddenly thought in panic, and my mind was asking me to run as the creature began to move towards me from the front.

Its huge body did not even seem hard to move in this small space of the classroom. I moved to another side of the classroom. But this thing turned even before I made the move. Its speed in this small room seemed very unnatural. Just as my eyes blinked for a second, the creature had already rushed towards me, just a few feet away. Just one more step, and it could reach me.

I closed my eyes. I knew I didn’t have any hope to face this predatory thing that could read my mind and move at inhuman speed. When I was waiting for my death, everything seemed to just stop.

I still closed my eyes, then opened them again, but nothing happened. That human-like creature, with extremely exaggerated height but inhuman speed, was just gone. I moved my torchlight around every corner of the classroom. But there was nothing here. The classroom was still silent, and seemed never changed.

I checked myself. I was already covered in sweat from the escape and fear. But at least everything had ended, perhaps. But was it that I really heard my wife’s voice from that creature? Did that creature swallow my wife? I thought.

When I passed the wooden door that seemed illuminated by light without a power source, I entered another classroom. I tried to look for another exit, but failed. I was trapped here.

I thought about calling someone. Maybe I could stop anyone else from coming here.

I took out my phone, my fingers shaking. I needed to warn someone. Anyone.

Suddenly, my torchlight went dark. I pressed the button again and again. It didn’t work.

Then the surrounding area became bright again. It wasn’t my torchlight. A light appeared on the upper floor, without any power source.

“Are you sure?”

The question felt comforting. Reassuring.

“Help,” I said into the phone. “We’re here. Please come.”
