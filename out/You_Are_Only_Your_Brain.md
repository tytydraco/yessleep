The first thing I need you to know before you read this, is that I’m not questioning my sanity. I already know I lost my mind ages ago, maybe even before this all started happening. For a number of reasons, all of which you’ll come to understand as you read further, I’m not the most reliable narrator of this story. I can’t be. But due to the cruelty of fate, combined with a few less-than-stellar choices I made back when I had some semblance of an ego, I’m the only person alive who can recount all of what happened. Or at least a good chunk of what happened. Or a good chunk of what I think happened. It’s entirely possible that nothing I’m about to tell you actually exists or matters, but the way I see it the odds are 50/50, and I just can’t take that chance. Either way, even if I am making this all up, it’s gravely important that someone else knows what I thought I experienced.

I can’t give you my name for many reasons, some of which have nothing to do with this post, but for context, I have a huge passion for the mind. I have a double PhD in psychology and neuroscience, and before all this happened I frequently gave lectures and attended debates on the topic. You might’ve seen one of my TED Talks on YouTube. I was also in a couple WIRED videos, and at one time I even had my own neuroscience-related channel, though I could never get my subscriber count into the 6 digits. You also might’ve seen me in one of those “Liberals/Conservatives Get Owned” compilations, if you’re into those things. Stuff like that isn’t my cup of tea, but I tend to show up in those videos a lot because of my cutthroat debating style and my tendency to get angry and mean when my opponent is very clearly talking out of their ass.

I like to describe myself as a functioning paranoid. I keep a large sum of cash in a safe in my closet. I have a few barrels of grain stored in my shed. I have a gun and some bullets in the drawer of my nightstand. I never believed in any conspiracy theories or apocalyptic scenarios, but it doesn’t hurt to be prepared. I didn’t think much of my mild paranoia back then because I couldn’t think of a reason for it being a negative trait. If anything, I just saw it as survival instincts on overdrive. I never went so far as to put us in a financial hole with my prep work, and I never preached my overly careful lifestyle to anyone else. The only other person who knew about my “cautious” side was my wife, and she never expressed any discomfort with any of it. She thought it was cute that I had something like that to hyperfixate on, and whenever we saw some sort of riot or mass shooting unfold on the news, she’d admit she felt safer knowing that survival was my wheelhouse. So yeah, I didn’t think much of it. But looking back, that initial sliver of paranoia is probably what led to my current daily routine.

I have kept my eyes closed for almost 3 years now. For a large majority of the time that I’m awake, and the entirety of the time that I’m asleep, I have wax molds over my closed eyelids. On top of that, cotton balls for padding. On top of that, an opaque, almost duct-tape-like gauze, wrapped around my head about a dozen times. On top of that, a black opaque sleeping mask. On top of that, a black morph suit mask. And on top of that, a thick black opaque sack. I attach the rim of the sack — the part that hangs around my neck and shoulders — to bungee cords, which are then tautly attached to my pants. Two connection points in the front, and two in the back, for both the sack and the pants.

Twice a day, once when I wake up and once before I go to bed, I remove the ensemble to clean my face, hair, and eye sockets. Before the removal, I enter the bedroom and lock the door behind me, then I enter the adjoining bathroom and lock that door. The bathroom is relatively small, and it’s fairly easy to check for anyone else’s presence just by waving my arms around me. I wave them at a moderate elevation, then high up, then back to the normal elevation, then low down, then high up again, then at the normal elevation one more time, just to be absolutely positive no one can avoid my arms no matter what they try. Once I’m sure, I yell “Marco!” and my wife yells back “Polo!” to assure me she’s on the other side of the house. She can’t be with me during these times, and she understands that. Only then do I remove everything and commence cleaning, keeping my eyes tightly shut the whole time. Once I’ve done that, I apply new wax — the same stuff used for paperless body waxing — to my sockets, then I wait for it to cool. Then I put the other layers on. I’ve gotten so good at the routine that I can do the whole thing, from locking the bedroom door to unlocking it, in about 10 minutes.

Since this whole getup partially impairs hearing, I get around my house by touch alone. I promise you that feat isn’t nearly as impressive as it sounds. You probably do the same thing without thinking about it. Think of all the times you’ve walked around and completed tasks in your living space while paying full attention to your cell phone. There are still drawbacks and hazards, however. Broken glass on the floor, hot stovetops, and so on. But again, I’m careful. And I’m never in a hurry anyway. I take extra time to absorb my surroundings as much as I can. Prodding each step with my toes before placing my foot down, orienting myself constantly to make sure I know exactly where I am at all times. I’m a bit of an expert at it now.

My wife likes to help whenever she’s home. She doesn’t have to, but she likes to. And I love having her around. She’ll gently grab me by my upper arm to guide me around the house, and I can feel her warmth through her touch. She’ll cook meals for me so I don’t have to fumble around the kitchen on my own, and I’ll taste her love and generosity through her food. People always say when you go blind, your other senses heighten to compromise. I don’t know if I’ve experienced that myself, but I understand what they’re getting at. Ever since “blinding” myself, I’ve grown far more attuned to all of the different ways my wife expresses her love, and for that I’m grateful. I wouldn’t have made it this far if she wasn’t by my side every step of the way, giving me her everlasting moral support. I can tell that sometimes, she wishes things weren’t this way. She never says it, but I can tell. I can hear it in the hesitation between words during certain conversations. I am a psychologist, after all. She wishes more than anything that she can look me in the eyes again, and that I can look at her, and it breaks my heart. She hopes that one day we can walk through the park again. I haven’t been outside in years.

At the time this all started, I was at the peak of my D-tier internet celebrity career. MoistCr1TiKaL made a video about one of my debate clips, and it was getting big numbers. I had amassed a cult following of chronically online teenagers who idolized me as some sort of linguistic superhero, using nothing but my voice to raze my opponents to the ground. It was creepy, but I guess a little flattering.

One day, I got a call from one of my old colleagues. He had seen my recent success, and he wanted to discuss a psych paper he was working on. He wanted to meet up for lunch and talk about it in person. I hadn’t seen him in years, so I was excited to catch up with him. We decided to meet at the cafe we used to always go to between classes. I showed up 15 minutes early (I have a nasty habit of doing that), and I sat on a bench just outside the doors, waiting for his arrival. I texted him and offered to get us a table, but he specifically wanted me to wait outside. Maybe 30 seconds after I sat down, a large black SUV came around the corner and stopped at the curb right next to the bench. The windows and windshield were all heavily tinted; I could see nothing inside. Then the passenger-side back door opened, and I could see who opened it. My old colleague. I could also see two strikingly average-looking men wearing black suits, sitting up front. They didn’t even turn their heads to acknowledge my existence. Definitely weird, but my colleague was being so nonchalant about it, I didn’t think much of it. He was beckoning me to the car like they were about to go to a club, and they didn’t want me to miss out. “Come on in, the water’s fine!” So I got in the car.

Half an hour passed before we reached the Pentagon. We drove into a sort of garage-like thing that adjoined the building. It had no windows. Once we got out of the car, I had to remove everything from my person that had any chance of containing metal or metal-adjacent properties. Cell phone, wallet, keys, wedding ring, glasses, belt. They even cut off the metal fastener of my jeans. They asked me if I had any fillings or artificial joints, which luckily, I didn’t. Then I walked through a metal detector so precise it could tell me how much iron was in my diet. Once it gave me the green light, I was taken into another room and asked to remove all my clothes. Once fully nude, a more extensive search was performed. I won’t go into detail on that one, but you get the Idea. Bend over, cough, stuff like that. The entire time, my colleague was giddy with excitement. He had the disturbing glee of an emotionally stunted 8th grader who found a dead rattlesnake on the sidewalk and couldn’t wait to show it to me.

They gave me new clothes to wear, an all-white set that was maybe one step up from hospital clothes, and then they sat me down in a meeting room and gave me a job offer. It was an intimate setting, just me, my colleague, and a suit, sitting at a 12-seater table, as if the importance of the conversation alone was deserving of this room. The unidentified CIA man said that they’ve been keeping tabs on all my videos. He didn’t say it in an intimidating way. It was more like he was implying the CIA was a huge fan of my work, like the chief wanted an autograph or something. I would’ve been blushing if I didn’t know the real reason behind it. They were softening me up. They wanted to play the friend so that when the time came, whatever offer they gave me would sound more enticing. That must’ve been why my colleague was here. It’s psych 101. So I played along. Why not. Let’s see where this is going.

When we finally got down to brass tacks, it was cryptic to say the least. They were trying to hammer home the dire importance of the project, but they never directly told me what it was. They gave me a few tidbits of info here and there and left me to fill in the picture, like the whole thing was a lateral thinking puzzle. But from what I could tell, it sounded like some sort of MK-Ultra-esque experiment. The job they had lined up for me wasn’t anything hands-on. I was supposed to be a glorified human search engine. They’d give me a prompt. Something like, “We’re trying to study joy. How should we go about that?” And I’d type up a quick paper of everything they need to know. Which part of the brain registers joy, which chemicals and hormones contribute, what joy’s primal purpose is, etc. The paper would then be given to a medical engineer or a computer scientist, and they’d work with a creative team to decide how to best go about the project. Then tests would be conducted. But of course, once the paper left my hands, I’d never hear the results of any other part of the project. I would type up these papers at the Pentagon, on a very sporadic schedule over the course of at least 3 months, but no longer than 6 months, and at the end of the project, I’d get a cool 100 grand. No tax.

Of course I took the job. And yeah, I’ll admit it, it’s because it sounded cool as hell. It’s the exact scenario that’d make a nerdy high school sophomore cream their pants. I was well aware that some shady stuff was going on, but I’d never see any of it. I’d never even hear about it. And they’re gonna go through with the project whether or not I’m the one who writes those papers. Worst comes to worst, some whistleblower blows the whole operation, a bunch of CIA guys get arrested, and I could be that one guy who everyone interviews. The dude who knew about the project somewhat, but didn’t grasp the severity of it. “I didn’t have a clue what was going on, I just thought we were making some cool drugs.” There’s always one of those guys. Not to mention, the $100,000. I could take my wife on a nice Caribbean vacation, give her a huge chunk of the money to spend however she pleases, and still have enough left over to put a sizable down payment on the cellar I wanted to build. At the end of the day, my conscience didn’t stand a chance.

My schedule was a lot more sparse than I initially thought. I’d come in for an 8-hour shift, 2 or 3 days in a row, once or twice a month. Every time I came in, I’d have to do the metal detector routine. After the second time, I started showing up with nothing in my pockets, and I’d wear sweatpants. It was just easier. The only thing I needed was my glasses. And they seemed to not care what I wore, as long as it had no metal. After getting the OK, I’d walk to the nearest elevator, and take it below ground. There was always an agent in the elevator, and they were the only one with access to the subterranean floors. After exiting, I’d be given my prompt. It was always a hard copy, and it was always in a manilla envelope. Then I’d walk down a long hallway of identical-looking soundproof rooms. They weren’t large. Maybe just a tad bigger than a solo music practice room at a college. Once I found a vacant room, I’d enter it and lock the door behind me. The door would have no window, and neither would the walls. Only three things existed in these rooms. A folding table, a cushioned swivel chair, and a mechanical typewriter. Only once I locked the door behind me could I open up the envelope and view its contents. Then I’d get to typing. Upon finishing a paper, I’d open the door and yell for an agent. Once they showed up, they’d thoroughly inspect the paper, then they’d carefully place it in a separate manilla envelope, leave the room, and do God knows what with it. We could take breaks whenever we wanted, but we’d have to be thoroughly searched before riding back up to the cafeteria, so I only took 1 or 2 a day.

If it isn’t already obvious, all of what I’m about to tell you is classified information. I could be shot for typing this. I just don’t give a shit anymore. I’m going to leave certain things out, because I do still believe in the importance of privacy and there’s a lot of employees there whom I still respect, but there are things that need to be said. And you also need to understand, these are just things from my perspective. I was just a single cog in the machine. I don’t have the full story and I never will. No one will. Just know that once you finish reading this, I’ll have given you every last piece of information I can.

The first thing I worked on was Project Xavier. None of the projects had official names, at least none that I was aware of. So I named them myself. I used comic book references because they were good mnemonic devices, plus it helped solidify my “Cool CIA Guy” fantasy. The prompt for this one was by far the most basic. They wanted to read minds, and they had no Idea how to do it. To paraphrase, they essentially handed me a paper that just said “Telepathy… any ideas?” And to be clear, they wanted access to the exact thoughts in people’s heads. It’d be useless to tell them that 80% of human emotion is expressed through body language, because that wasn’t what they were looking for. They didn’t want some half-baked guestimate of what’s on someone’s mind, they wanted the real thing.

I attacked this problem from two sides at the same time. There are two main factors that contribute to all human thought: logical thinking, and emotion. The latter is actually incredibly simple to detect. Emotions are just chemicals, after all. If you can sniff out the chemical, you can make a reasonable guess on the emotion. It’s how dogs always know what their owners are feeling. They’ve got that special nose of theirs. All you need is a fine-tuned device that can detect those chemicals, and devices like that already exist in abundance. The logical thinking side, however, is a separate problem entirely. It’s exponentially harder to figure out the exact rational calculations that the brain is conducting at any given moment. But a good place to start is electromagnetic fields. Believe it or not, your brain conducts electricity. It’s a miniscule amount, not nearly strong enough to power any of the appliances in your house, but it’s there. And if it conducts electricity, it generates its own electromagnetic field. The precision a machine would need to fully dissect that field would be extraordinary, but technically, it’s possible. If said machine existed, you could use it to figure out exactly which synapses are firing, which axons are carrying the information, and which sections of the brain that information reaches, and the procedure would be entirely noninvasive. The only thing left to figure out would be what those specific synapses, axons, and brain sections stand for, and that’s a lengthy, near-impossible process in itself, but that’s not my job. Combine those calculations with the chemical detection and you’d have a pretty good idea of what someone’s thinking. It’s not perfect, but it works. I typed up the necessary information in roughly two days’ time.

It was around the time I finished that first paper that I realized just how many people must be working on this thing. I could tell by how little information they were giving me, mixed with how many workrooms were occupied whenever I walked down that hallway. The workload was probably being divided into dozens, maybe even hundreds, of sections, and each section given to a separate professional to work on alone. There was even a good chance I wasn’t the only neuroscientist working on it. None of that was inherently weird. Dividing up tasks is the most efficient way to get work done, it’s how we got a rocket ship to the Moon in the 60’s. Still, if I knew just how many people were working on this thing, and what their professions were, I probably wouldn’t have stuck around.

I named the second prompt Project Mysterio. Technically, this was a collection of prompts, given to me over the course of several days, and it took me a while to figure out exactly what they wanted, but I eventually got the gist. They wanted total control of the 5 senses. They wanted the ability to put anyone they chose in an illusion so real they couldn’t tell fantasy from reality. A little creepier, but I still didn’t think much of it. Maybe in a decade we’d have some really cool VR software.

The main problem they were facing was that they were trying to attack this from the outside in. That’s one way to go about it, but it’s the wrong way. You can only do so much to manipulate someone’s ears, eyes, nose, and skin, and the participant will always be able to tell that something’s amiss. That’s just a natural instinct. It would make a lot more sense to directly manipulate the parts of the brain that register these senses. The occipital lobe processes the images your eyes take in. The temporal lobe processes the auditory stimuli that brush against your eardrums, and it also contains the olfactory cortex, responsible for processing smells. The insular cortex processes taste. And the parietal lobe processes anything relating to the nerves — stuff like touch, pressure, pain, and temperature — while also helping with spatial orientation. All of your sensory receptors, eardrums, taste buds, olfactory nerves, etc., they could all be working perfectly, but if the previously mentioned sections of your brain were properly manipulated, you could entirely misinterpret the information you’re receiving. Damage to these parts of the brain, either from trauma, head injury, or some cruel act of God, is what eventually leads to mental disorders like schizophrenia. I couldn’t even fathom a guess as to how to go about properly manipulating said brain sections, but again, not my job.

This paper took me a little over a week to type up, and I added an asterisk to the end. The hardest sense to manipulate, by a huge margin, would be sight, because it’s almost directly hardwired into the brain. Humans being the apex predators they are, it only makes sense. We don’t need to listen as carefully for threats, we don’t need to fully sniff out our environments. What matters to us, instinctually, is hunting and killing, and that’s primarily directed by eyesight.

The third prompt was Project Agamotto. They wanted to significantly slow down the human perception of time. For this one, they already had a concrete idea, and they needed my help with improving it. They were using a modified adrenaline compound. I almost scoffed when I read that. Sure, adrenaline works, to an extent. Just ask any long distance runner, they’ll say the music that plays through their headphones while jogging sounds a bit slower than when they listen to the same music on a leisurely car ride. It doesn’t not work, but adrenaline eventually reaches an impassable wall. You can only pump yourself with so many uppers before your heart explodes. 

Luckily, I worked on this exact subject matter nearly a decade prior. Scientists were trying to devise a way for convicts to experience the length of a full prison sentence in only a fraction of the time. My solution was psychedelics. Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, is one of the strongest psychoactive chemicals known to man. A DMT trip only lasts 15 minutes, but to the user it can feel like hours, days, weeks, or in some rare cases, years. DMT is found naturally in many plants and animals, including, most importantly, humans. A lot of research points to the theory that your brain releases DMT upon death, with some specialists believing that it can also be released earlier during certain intense traumas, like childbirth, but whether or not it ever gets released, your brain is still capable of producing it at all times. Find a way to trigger the brain to release it, then find a way to control the chemical structure and direction of flow once it’s released, and you’re golden.

I had a lot of fun typing this one up. This was essentially a “You’re wrong, and here’s why” paper, and those are my favorite to write. The cherry on top was that I was writing it to the CIA. And since I was on a roll, I added that DMT would also vastly help the manipulation of the senses, should those tests be performed together. After inspecting the paper, the agent gave me an approving nod, which I could only guess was the CIA equivalent of a “Good job!” and a high five.

During my time at the Pentagon, I only knew the name of one other person who was helping with this project. For the sake of this post, I’ll call him John. John was an astrophysicist, and he was referred to by many as the smartest person in the building. He was the kind of guy who could quickly find an astoundingly simple solution to any problem you threw at him. He was also the kind of guy who always had a jovial air about him no matter what. It was impossible to knock the smile off his face. I became good friends with him because we had the same gallows humor about what we were doing. We never got into the specifics of our work, but it was pretty obvious that we were working on the same thing. We started coordinating our breaks with each other, and we’d use the time to have a good laugh over lunch.

One day, maybe a week after I finished the third paper, I saw John at the cafeteria, and he was different. He had an excellent poker face, still smiling, still joking, but he was hiding something. It was like there was a second John in his head who was terrified, and the John on the surface was just barely holding him back. He asked me if I could meet up with him later for dinner, outside of work. It wasn’t allowed, but I said yes, because he was the only person there who I considered more than a coworker.

We met at a diner at around 10 PM, and John’s facade was gone. He looked so scared he was practically trembling. The waitress hadn’t even given us our menus before he started spinning this story about all the work the CIA was forcing on him. The first thing he said was that the CIA managed to open a portal to another dimension and they were conversing with intelligent lifeforms on the other side, and after that, I tuned out. It was clear that something was very mentally wrong with him, and he was having a full-on schizophrenic episode. Maybe he was usually on meds but he stopped taking them. He was still my friend, and I could tell that he needed to get this off his chest, so I still nodded, I still offered the right responses at the right times, but mentally I was somewhere else. I retained almost nothing from our talk. After about 90 minutes of this weird trauma dumping, he got up to go to the bathroom, and he never came back. I didn’t even notice for over half an hour, because about 5 minutes after he left, my wife called to check up on me and I got lost in conversation. Once I realized, I went to the bathroom to check up on him, but he was just gone. Then I went outside and looked for his car. Also gone.

Maybe he left through the front door and I just didn’t notice. But our booth was right by the front, I had a clear view of the door the whole time. I thought of calling the cops, but what would I tell them? That my CIA coworker told a bunch of classified secrets then dipped, and now I can’t find him? I don’t even think I could legally give them his name. I didn’t know where he lived, and I didn’t have his email or phone number. So I just bottled the fear up and I went home. But when I got there, my wife was already asleep, and I was left alone with nothing else to think about.

At some point that night, I remembered that during John’s episode, I started an audio recording on my phone under the table. I thought the sudden break of a man who was irrefutably sane just days ago was fascinating, and I wanted to psychoanalyze the conversation later. With nothing better to do, I listened to the recording. I’m not going to share the exact audio, but here’s a transcript of what John said:

“The people working with me down there, they keep calling those things ghosts, or angels, or something along those lines, and it’s infuriating. I know they do it so they can feel more familiarized with the shit that goes on down there, but not only is it wrong, it’s dangerous. If you keep referring to something as a ghost, eventually you’ll start to assume it has the properties of a ghost. You’ll start basing your decisions off of those assumptions. These things aren’t ghosts, they’re not angels, they’re aliens. They don’t come from another planet, they come from a separate plane of existence. For some reason, God knows why, we’re the only ones who can control the gateway. They need our permission to cross over into our realm. And we haven’t let any of them through yet.

“Huh? Oh, yeah, I’ll take a refill. Uhh, Dr Pepper. Huh? Oh that’s right, Pibb. Sorry. Pibb.

“Anyways, take a wild fucking guess what the CIA wants to use those things for. Weapons of war. Even if those ethereal fuckers crossed through to our side, they wouldn’t be able to make physical contact with anything. It’s like sunlight trying to interact with a glass window, it just doesn’t work. And that’s exactly what the CIA wants. An unkillable death machine. So they’re coming up with all these gadgets that the aliens could use to psychologically destroy the enemy, shit that they wouldn’t have to physically touch to use. And they plan to offer the aliens interdimensional visas in exchange for their service. They’re trying to implement a fucking revolving door immigration system.

“Now here’s the thing. Our plane of existence, the one we’re in right now, is largely dictated by gravity. Every step of evolution experienced by every plant, animal, bug, and microbe on Earth, can be traced back to the way gravity affects them. And out of all the forces of physics, gravity is by far the weakest. It’s not even close. Those ‘ghosts’ that the CIA is playing checkers with? Their plane is dictated by magnetism. They’ve evolved to thrive in a world with forces vastly superior to ours. They don’t give a fuck about us. I can tell. But it’s not the way an alcoholic mother doesn’t care about her children. It’s the way that an elephant doesn’t care about an ant. You wanna hear my opinion? I don’t think they need any of our gadgets to fuck us up. I don’t think we’re giving them anything they don’t already have. I think we’re just giving them ideas.”

I must’ve listened to that audio 20 times in a row, and it was starting to get to me. I couldn’t keep this to myself. I needed to tell someone. But not my wife. I would never burden her with that information. I decided to text the recording to my old colleague, the same one who got me into this mess. I sent him the audio, and as soon as the text went through, it vanished. Just disappeared into thin air. I tried again, and it vanished again. Then my WiFi and data shut off. I thought I was losing my mind.

The next morning, the CIA requested that I come to the Pentagon immediately. When I got there, they didn’t tie me up, they didn’t waterboard me, they didn’t beat me with phone books. They explained everything in a calm and friendly manner. To me that was even scarier. They didn’t bug my house, but as soon as I started working for them they installed a program onto all the devices in my house through wifi, including my cell phone. The program used AI to detect if I was trying to send anything to anyone else that had incriminating evidence, and as soon as it found a match, it terminated the message in a fraction of a second. They seemed understanding of what I did, given the stress I was feeling. But they wanted it to never happen again. I never saw John again after that night at the diner.

I couldn’t think of a comic reference for the fourth and final prompt. I ended up calling it Project Lovecraft. In the realm of grimdark fantasy, there exists a monster called an eldritch abomination, a creature so disgustingly complex that merely seeing it, perceiving it with your own 2 eyes, kills you. The CIA wanted to create something they referred to as a heartstopper. An image that could murder. And I wanted to be done with this job. I was terrified thinking of all the ways they could use it, but I wrote the paper anyway, and I did a damn good job. I didn’t want them using it on me.

Fear is the most primal emotion. It’s the most important contributor to every decision we make in our day-to-day lives. And since fear is so hardwired into us, there exists things that all humans instinctively fear. Long sharp teeth, fully bared. Glowing eyes with slits for pupils. Use traits like that as the base. But if you want it to work 100% of the time, it can’t be a still image. Shifting colors have a much larger impact on the brain. Cuttlefish use color-changing pigments in their skin to hypnotize their prey. There are color patterns that can cause heart palpitations. There are color patterns that can cause seizures. There are color patterns that can make you forget to breathe. Blend these in with the hellish grin, bring it to life, and pat yourself on the back. You just made a psychological hand grenade. I typed the paper up as fast as I could, I turned it in, and I got the hell out of Dodge.

A few days later, I went back to the Pentagon one last time to pick up my paycheck. They were having trouble finding it, so they asked me to wait in the cafeteria. That’s when it happened.

There’s only one elevator shaft that goes all the way down to the lowest floor, and it’s the same one that connects to the cafeteria. After about 5 minutes of waiting for my money, the doors to the elevator opened and two agents emerged, carrying a third agent in their arms. The two standing agents were frantic and panicked. The third agent was in a straight jacket, and she was trying everything in her power to get out of it. A few medical staff met them at the elevator, put the writhing lady on a stretcher, tied her down, and wheeled her away. 10 minutes later, at least 40 people entered the cafeteria and formed a line at the elevator. A few agents, a priest, a rabbi, an imam, a lama, a shaman, a monk, an astrologist, just about every religious or spiritual figure you could think of, and at the very end, 2 dozen US Marines armed to the teeth. It would’ve looked like something out of a Monty Python sketch if it wasn’t for the expressions on their faces. Each time a religious figure got in the elevator, an agent gave them a blindfold and told them to put it on. Then the doors closed and the elevator descended. A few minutes would pass, and the next person would go in. None of them were coming back up. At the end of the line, more agents were giving the marines eyewear that looked similar to drunk goggles.

I knew what was happening. They fucked up bad, and they were trying to fix it. They were throwing everything they had at it, but it wasn’t gonna work, because they were only thinking in terms of ghosts and angels. If all else failed, the marines would go down there and blow the place to smithereens. Why weren’t they sending the marines first? Because they were still trying to smooth the situation over. They didn’t want to waste all their effort and hard work. They were just using the muscle as a last resort. But none of it was going to work. I don’t know why I did this. Maybe I still had a hero complex. Maybe curiosity got the best of me. Maybe I just felt guilty. I went to the front of the line and told them to send me down next. At that moment, I felt like I was the only person who could fix this. The agent who handed me the blindfold was a Hispanic woman with curly black hair, partially help up in a clip. She wore brown wire frame glasses. She had a mole on the right side of her nose and a small gap in the middle of her 2 front teeth. I remember her face so vividly because she was the last thing I ever saw.

Once we got to the bottom, the doors opened and someone grabbed my hand. He said he was going to lead me to the lab, but it was going to take a while because he was also blindfolded. We blindly sped down a hallway for a few minutes, but before we could get to our destination, an alarm sounded. A robotic female voice came over the intercom, and it was saying “WARNING: CONTAINMENT BREACH” on repeat. The agent who was guiding me swore and started leading me in a different direction. We found what I assumed was a hiding spot, and he told me to curl up into as small of a ball as possible, and wait. So I did. After another few minutes, I started hearing gunfire and explosions. They finally sent the marines. Someone shouted “NOTHING’S WORKING, SWITCH TO SONICS!!!” at the top of their lungs, then I heard what could only be described as the sound of a jet engine starting up, followed by a series of low bassy booms that felt like they were shaking the whole Earth. Then the booms stopped, the alarm stopped, and everything went quiet. Someone said “We got ‘em!”, and everyone started cheering.

The agent next to me took his blindfold off, and told me to stand up and do the same. I stood up, I took the blindfold off, and I almost opened my eyes, but I didn’t. I kept them closed. I put the blindfold back on. I refused to take it off again. I had someone guide me back up to the first floor, find my paycheck, and get me an Uber home. Then I became a recluse, I crafted my new routine, and I’ve been following it for 34 months and 5 days.

The reason I’m sending this post is because right now I don’t know where my wife is. Earlier we were sitting in the living room, listening to music and talking, when the power went out. I wouldn’t have even noticed if it wasn’t for my wife letting out a startled scream, followed by a laugh. She made some joke that now she knows what it’s like to be me, then she found a flashlight in the kitchen and went upstairs to our bedroom to get some candles. And she never came back down. It’s been an hour now. After the first few minutes, I yelled “Marco!” a few times, and got nothing back. And that’s when I pulled out my phone and started using speech-to-text to write this. After giving it some thought, I’m assuming that one of three things happened.

The first scenario, the one I’m least afraid of, is that the CIA finally decided I have too much information. They cut the power to my house and either captured or neutralized my wife, and next they’re going to kill me, but not before listening to everything I have to say.

The second scenario, the middle ground of my fears, is that none of this is real. I don’t think I ever left that hallway. I think somehow, someway, those aliens found a way to bridge the gap between our worlds, and they started killing every human they could find. I think one of them knows I’m there. I think it wants to kill me, but it can’t touch me, and it can’t manipulate my eyes. I think it knows all of my thoughts and memories. I think it started laying out a fantasy in my head, through the manipulation of my other 4 senses. I think it’s trying to make me believe that the humans won, and that I went back home, and that I’ve been taken care of by my wife for almost 3 years. I don’t think it’s actually been 3 years. I think it’s been 10 seconds. I think that in those 10 seconds, the alien figured out that my wife is my Achilles heel, and it took her out of the fantasy to get my attention. I think it looks like a horror beyond comprehension. I think it’s 2 inches away from my face. I think it wants me to open my eyes.

The third scenario, the one I’m most afraid of, is that there’s no CIA out to get me, and there’s no alien standing in front of me, and my wife fell and hit her head, or had a heart attack, or suffered an aneurism, and I wasn’t there to make sure she’s okay because I’m a fucking coward. So I need to go up there, and I need to see what happened.

I understand the irony in all this. If I really am still in that hallway, then this post isn’t real and it’ll never reach anyone. If I’m not in the hallway, if I actually am in my house, then you probably have nothing to worry about anyway. But still, even if the latter is true, I needed to tell someone else this awful idea that worked its way into my head. You are only your brain. Even if you believe in the concept of a soul, that soul still receives all of its information from a thinking machine that is largely flawed and prone to manipulation. As much as we want to believe otherwise, there will always be a concrete wall between what is going on around us and how we perceive it. And that terrifies me.
