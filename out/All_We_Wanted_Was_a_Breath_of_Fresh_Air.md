Today is Friday. Normally, I would relax for about 30 minutes before diving into another study session, but I am completely distraught.

I poured my heart and soul into studying for the fluid mechanics midterm, and what do I get as a reward? A D. A goddamn D! What am I supposed to do with that? I can't graduate my fourth year in physics with a D.

I flew into a rage. Papers scattered around me, pillows were punched, and notebooks were thrown all over the place. By the end of the carnage, my rented bachelor apartment was a mess.

After calming down, I decided to clean up. Then my phone started to ring. It was Roxanne. I answered.

"Hey Roxanne," I said. "What's up?"

"I think you know what's up," Roxanne replied, her voice irritated. "That midterm was the worst!"

"Oh, totally!" I agreed.

"I told you Dr. Neuman is a terrible teacher!" Roxanne exclaimed. "He can't teach at all, and he's flunking everyone!"

"You're right," I sighed in defeat. "I studied for that exam every single day, and yet I still failed. I need a break."

"Maybe we should go somewhere. I know my brother does," Roxanne suggested. "Let's go on a road trip to Port Kellingdale and visit Amber Pier."

"Meet me at my place in half an hour?" I asked.

"Yup," Roxanne said.

She hung up, and I packed some road snacks and spare clothes for the trip. We met up by my car and started the road trip to Port Kellingdale.

Roxanne and her brother, Jerome, have been my childhood friends since I was nine. We all grew up with middle-class parents in the suburbs of the west coast, specifically the small town of Dale. As children, we played together a lot, always hanging out after class—whether playing softball in the park, exploring the forest, or just hanging out at my place playing video games. They knew I got carried away with studying, but they always knew how to calm me down and bring me back to reality.

I always considered Roxanne the free spirit of the group. She goes with the flow, never trying to fight the uncontrollable. I admire that about her. She never gets terribly stressed out about anything. If she does, well, let's just say it was something that really pushed her buttons. And that's saying something.

Jerome, on the other hand, is the opposite. He is governed by his emotions before considering the consequences of his actions. Still, he's genuinely a nice guy. You'll know when he's happy, angry, or anything else really. He won't hide anything from you because he'll tell you, which makes him the most honest and trustworthy person I've ever met.

The small fishing village of Port Kellingdale is one of our favorite hangouts. Our families used to go there to relax. Our dads would fish while our moms prepared food for everyone. My friends and I would end up playing tag or racing on Amber Pier, a mile-long wooden pier that fishermen often use.

It's comforting to know that my family still lives in Dale. Always the same, never planning to move. It's that constant that lets me know there's always a home to go back to, even though it's a three-hour drive from the university.

The drive to Port Kellingdale took about four hours from my apartment. The road is always scenic, especially in the fall. You can see a wide array of colors from the leaves—the reds, yellows, greens, and oranges, which is my favorite color. Leaves falling from the trees always seemed magical to me, highlighting the beauty of nature. Sometimes the fog rolls in, especially during the evening, adding a spooky yet beautiful element to the town. But at the university, I seldom get to experience or appreciate that.

Today, the fog was especially thick. It took us some time to find the parking lot of the Drunken Fish bar. Still, with the street lights illuminating our way, it wasn't too difficult.

We decided to head to the bar and drink our sorrows away. As usual, Jerome cursed and complained about how the course sucked, how Dr. Neuman was an ass for not teaching us properly, and for giving us failing grades on the exam. Roxanne, as always, tried to cheer everyone up, saying that everything would be fine or that we'd do better on the finals. I remained the quiet type, holding it all in until something burst violently out of me.

After the bar, we checked into two rooms at the local motel and then decided to walk down the pier. It was evening now, but the lights on the pier illuminated our path and small parts of the water. If it were daytime, we would see the sea spanning for miles, surrounded by land and ocean. This natural topography prevents huge waves from hitting these shores, making this place ideal for swimming, which I did as a child. Today was no different—calm waters, a foggy night, and lamps lit on the pier. Just beautiful.

The pier might be a mile long, but it's not terribly wide—probably 12 yards at best. It's fairly old, too. The wooden handrails on the side protect people from falling, but some of them are bent out of their ideal position. Not a safety issue yet, but it could be in the future. The floorboards are sturdy, but you can see some of the boards are a lighter shade of brown while others are dark. It looks like they did some maintenance work recently. However, they all acted the same way, creaking with each step we took.

We weren’t alone on the pier. Fishermen and fisherwomen were there too, hoping to catch fish or crabs before calling it a night. They always seemed cheerful and talkative, greeting everyone who passed by. Considering it is a village, everyone here knew each other. One of the villagers, Jacques, an elderly fellow now, remembered us. He always found us amusing when we raced up and down the pier, laughing especially at me since I could never catch up to either Roxanne or Jerome.

“Well, well, well,” Jacques said with a smile as he approached us. “I haven’t seen you kids in forever. How have you been?”

“Not great,” Jerome replied. “We failed our midterms. Now we’re here to catch a break.”

Jacques laughed and said, “Why am I not surprised? Still playing around, eh?”

“Not this time,” I replied. “We studied our hardest and still failed.”

“That’s a shame,” Jacques said. “Well, maybe you’ll fare better in the rest of the course.”

He paused for a bit, then continued, “I’ll be reeling my stuff in now. Nice to see you three again. Tomorrow, if you’re still here, let’s hang out at the pier. Maybe you can help me catch some crabs. You can keep one of them, eh?”

We laughed. Then I said, “We would love that! 9:00 a.m. at your place?”

“Yes, please!” Jacques said. “See you folks then.”

We parted ways, happy to reunite with Jacques. Especially since we would be helping him catch crabs. Fun fellow. Probably have beers with him tomorrow and enjoy a good home-cooked meal.

We reached the end of the pier and stood there for a good 15 minutes, admiring the peace and quiet. It was beautiful. No one spoke; we just took in the nighttime scenery, clearing our thoughts from the terrible exam and breathing in the fresh air. Nothing beats this.

With silent agreement, we started to walk back.

Five minutes into our walk, we noticed an unattended fishing rod and toolbox. I thought that was strange. These folks usually wrap up by now. I started to wonder where this person had gone.

As we continued down, we saw someone’s belongings spread all over the center of the pier. The fishing rod was on the ground, a toolbox seemed to be knocked over with its contents spilled out, and a bucket appeared to be overturned, with fish and water scattered. One of the fish was still flopping, indicating this happened recently. Roxanne rescued the fish by throwing it back into the water.

“What happened here?” Roxanne said, alarmed by the scene.

“I don’t know,” Jerome said. “Something’s wrong.”

“Let’s get out of here quickly,” I added. “Maybe we can figure out what’s going on in town.”

We quickened our pace, but I was worried about our visibility. If something was wrong ahead, we wouldn’t know until we were maybe 15 yards away given the foggy conditions.

Somehow, the fog got thicker as we continued our pace. The air felt heavier, and visibility dropped significantly. I signaled to the group when I saw clothes lying on the ground—shirt, pants, socks, underwear, even a pair of boots—all near each other and covered in grey dust. The sight was eerie, as if someone had vanished into thin air, leaving only their garments behind.

“The pier is not safe!” Jerome exclaimed, his voice tinged with panic. “We need to leave. Maybe we should swim. Yes! Swim to safety.”

I could see the fear in his eyes. The idea of swimming in the dark, foggy waters seemed desperate, but his anxiety was palpable.

“I’m sure there’s a perfectly logical explanation for this,” Roxanne said, trying to maintain her composure. “Perhaps we can find someone to explain why they left their clothes here.”

Her attempt to stay rational was admirable, but the unease in her voice betrayed her. The fog seemed to close in around us, muffling sounds and distorting our surroundings. 

Before I could say anything, we saw Jacques running towards us. He seemed to be yelling something at us, but we couldn’t hear a thing. I was startled when I couldn’t hear his footsteps. He was wearing his mud boots, so for sure we would have heard him long before seeing him.

Then I noticed something strange—unnatural even. The fog around him was specifically pink or maybe a shade of light red, while my friends and I were in a white foggy area. I was about to mention it until Jerome called out to him.

“Is everything okay?” Jerome shouted at Jacques.

We heard nothing from him, but he continued to run towards us. Jerome looked at us and both Roxanne and I shrugged in response.

Jerome was about to yell once more when Jacques suddenly floated six feet off the ground. We all gasped, with Roxanne louder than the rest of us.

Within seconds, dark crimson air began to seep from Jacques' nose, mouth, ears, and even his eyes. It was a horrible sight—like something was sucking the life out of him. The fog surrounding him changed color to a more prominent, darker red, pulsating with an eerie glow.

Jacques' body began to thin, his flesh shrinking and contorting as if being drained of all vitality. His limbs elongated grotesquely, and his face twisted in silent agony. The transformation was rapid and horrifying, his once robust frame reduced to mere skin and bones. But even those were not spared; his skin appeared to dissolve, losing its vibrant color and turning a sickly grey.

The process was relentless. His bones became brittle and fragmented, disintegrating into fine dust. The crimson air continued to pour out, enveloping him in a sinister shroud. His eyes, once full of life, turned hollow and vacant before crumbling into ash.

Jacques' entire body turned into dust, a cloud of grey particles that dispersed into the thickening fog. Only his clothes remained, crashing to the ground without a sound.

We stood frozen, unable to comprehend the nightmare unfolding before us. The fog, now a deep crimson around the spot where Jacques had been, seemed to pulse with energy. Somehow, I felt that this fog, this thing, enjoyed sucking the life out of him. That pulsation within this thing felt like it was joyous, laughing even. I felt sick to my stomach.

The fog seemed to shift, as if it had a consciousness of its own. It felt like it was gazing towards us. The crimson mist began to move, creeping towards us with an eerie, deliberate motion. Panic surged through me, and without a sound, we all started to run like hell towards the end of the pier.

Our footsteps pounded against the wooden planks, the creaking and groaning of the pier echoing in the thick fog. The air was heavy, making each breath feel labored. The fog seemed to close in around us, its crimson tendrils reaching out as if trying to ensnare us.

Roxanne led the way, her pace frantic yet determined. Jerome followed closely, his eyes wide with fear. I brought up the rear, glancing back to see the fog gaining on us. It moved with an unnatural speed, its pulsations growing more intense, almost as if it were feeding off our terror.

We reached the end of the pier, but the fog showed no signs of stopping. It continued to advance, relentless and unyielding. We were trapped, the vast expanse of water before us.

"Jump!" Jerome shouted.

Roxanne hesitated, her eyes darting between the water and the encroaching fog. I could see the conflict in her expression—fear of the unknown versus the instinct to survive. The pier felt like it was towering ten yards above the water, making the jump seem even more daunting.

"There's no time!" I urged, my voice trembling. "We have to jump!"

With a final glance at the crimson fog, we leapt into the cold, dark waters below. The shock of the icy water enveloped me, but it was a welcome relief from that malicious fog.

I swam to the surface to catch my breath. Then I heard Roxanne’s scream beside me. That’s when I looked up.

To my horror, I saw Jerome floating above us, trapped by the crimson fog, knowing that his fate was sealed. My survival instincts kicked in, and I swam towards Roxanne, yelling at her that we needed to get out of here. Swim to the village. But she didn’t listen; she was still frozen in place.

I forced her to come with me. I grabbed her hand and started to swim towards the shore, pulling her along. The icy water stung our skin, but the adrenaline kept me moving. The fog did not chase us yet, seemingly busy with Jerome.

Roxanne finally snapped out of her daze and began to swim alongside me. We pushed through the water, our strokes frantic and desperate. The shore seemed so far away, but we couldn't stop. We had to escape.

It seemed that we were halfway there. But as I looked back, I could see the fog expanding at an ungodly rate. It began to spin, seemingly forming a crimson vortex. The water around us now seemed to fight us, creating waves in this once calm area. I heard thunder and lightning behind me, except it sounded off—metallic and unnatural.

Despite the sudden violent changes in the water, I swam. And I kept swimming. My muscles burned, and my lungs screamed for air, but I couldn't stop. Roxanne was right beside me.

The shore seemed to inch closer, but the waves continued to batter us, each one threatening to drag us under. The metallic thunder continuously screamed into the night.

Finally, with one last burst of energy, I reached the shore. I collapsed onto the sand, gasping for breath, my body trembling from exhaustion.

After a few seconds, I looked around and to my dismay, I didn’t see Roxanne. She wasn’t here. I called out her name, hoping that she would respond. I waited for a minute, which felt like hours.

I could see that the crimson vortex did not chase us. It was still there, at the end of the pier. But it had expanded to such an ungodly size that it seemed to engulf half of the pier.

My panic must have gotten the best of me. I reasoned that Roxanne may have gotten here first and was seeking safety in the village. I quickly scanned my surroundings and noticed that the fog along the shoreline was a natural white. Taking my chances, I rushed into the village, hoping to find Roxanne and a way out.

I found my car in the lot near the shore. Sadly, since I swam for my life, my fob in my pocket was damaged from the water, and I was unable to open the door. I decided to venture further into town to see if there were any survivors. As I kept walking, I could see items scattered along the ground and clothes covered with dust all over. This was a terrible scene. I hoped that these folks' suffering didn’t last long.

The bar door seemed open, inviting me in. I rushed into the bar and quickly scanned it. The scene was just the same—broken glass, tables and chairs knocked over, dust-covered clothes all over the floor. I hoped the dead could forgive me, but my survival instincts kicked in. I started going through the clothes, hoping to find car keys. At last, I found them. A pair of pants behind the bar counter contained a set of keys. I prayed to God that the thing was not in town, and I decided to go to the lot and look for the car that would hopefully respond.

A pick-up truck in the shore parking lot briefly beeped to life, responding to the fob’s call. I immediately rushed to it, afraid that the fog would suddenly become aware of my presence. I opened the driver’s door but paused before I could get in.

I had to check that Roxanne made it. I couldn’t live with myself if she was still out there.

I quickly walked around and checked my surroundings. The pink fog was still there. It hadn’t moved a bit. I scanned for a few seconds.

Just before I gave up, I saw her. She was on the beach, washed up by the waves. My heart dropped.

I rushed towards her.

I checked her pulse but couldn’t tell if she had one. Then I checked her breathing. I felt the faintest amount of hot breath hit my hand. She was still alive. Hope immediately surged into me.

I carried her gently from the sands and made a dash towards the truck, fighting every aching muscle in my body. I almost stumbled a few times due to exhaustion, but I finally made it.

I gently laid her in the passenger seat and buckled her seatbelt. Then, I dashed towards the driver’s side.

After positioning myself in the driver’s seat, I started the engine. It was loud. Really loud. I could hear the engine roar. It sounded like the previous owner had upgraded it.

Then, I saw movement in front of me. From the vortex. It stopped rotating. Thunder and lightning ceased. It looked like a large fog instead. Then, it began to move. Towards us.

I drove out of that lot like a bat out of hell, not without hitting a few cars along the way.

It felt like it was closing the distance fast. I was sure that we were done for. But after minutes of driving, which felt like hours, the fog stopped following us half a mile or so after exiting Port Kellingdale. I breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that the threat was gone.

I drove non-stop to Argyle, which was another ten minutes away. I took her straight to Saint Paul’s General Hospital. The hospital staff treated both of us well. However, Roxanne appears to be in a coma still. It was very kind of them to put us in the same room, with my bed closest to the door and hers closest to the window.

The police arrived an hour or so later after I called them. Just one officer though—Officer Dave. Nice fellow. A little chubby but seems to have a sharp mind.

I told him everything that I saw, as unbelievable as it may be. I told him about the fog, how it killed people by sucking the life out of them, the clothes on the ground, the dust. Hell, I even told him that the car wasn’t ours, but I took it trying to escape the danger.

I thought he was going to laugh at me or put me in jail. But he said they hadn’t heard back from either Janet or Pierce from their nightly patrols. On top of that, he hadn’t heard back from his parents.

Considering how wild my story was, I don’t think he believed me fully. But he believed that there was a real threat, which was enough for me. He told me that he would organize a patrol of five or so people and investigate the town.

I begged him not to go. I told him again and again about the danger that lurks there. But he didn’t listen. He left the room, determined to do his duty. All I can do is pray that he and his team will make it out okay.

Before he left, he advised me to stay in town for a day or two to sort things out. That’s okay with me. I won’t be leaving this hospital bed anytime soon.

As I was about to fall asleep, I could hear Roxanne muttering in her sleep. I looked her way and saw that she was moving restlessly in her bed. She spoke phrases that I didn’t understand. The one that stood out to me was “world within worlds.”

I am not sure what that meant, but I am very concerned about her well-being.

I pressed the nurse’s call button, requesting aid as I could see her restlessness was getting worse.

Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. She keeps muttering that “it’s inside me.” I really don’t know what that means, but I am utterly afraid of the implications of that phrase.

Just then, a few nurses entered the room, attempting to treat Roxanne’s restlessness. They moved quickly and efficiently, checking her vitals and administering medication to calm her down. I watched anxiously, hoping that she would be okay here.

But the fear gnawed at me. I am afraid that she will only get worse. And I don’t know what to do.
