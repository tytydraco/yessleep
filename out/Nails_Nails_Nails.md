Has anyone heard of the Nails Motel? Its in Nails, New Mexico. They don't take cash or card, only nails. I didn't believe it either when I was told by my friend. But here I am, standing before a massive sand colored tower. Welcome to the Nails Motel it said in bright neon. It's maybe thirty or forty stories tall. No windows from what I can see but the lone front door summons me to enter. I feel sick, uneasy. I feel twisted. One part of me wants me go in, another tells me to run. It's late though, I drove a long time to get here. What's wrong with one night?



Did I want to enter? I guess it doesn't matter now that I'm in the lobby. Its empty with the exception of a welcome desk, a fold out chair, key rack, and an elevator on the far end. The ceiling lights flicker. I can also hear a bug zapper somewhere. The desk has a sign, it says 'Please take a key”. There is only one key hanging. Its cold and before I know it I'm standing, listening to elevator music. Where am I going?

My friend told me wishes are granted here. Does anyone know this place? I thought I saw another car parked besides mine when I arrived.



BING



The elevator door struggled to open. Peering into the dim tunnel I could see it was just a long carpeted hall. There's a room at the end. The door to it has my name. The key worked. Its so quiet. My room is really small but nice and cozy, like I belong. It was made for me. Bed, kitchen, bathroom. Portraits of me hang all over the tan walls. Where did they get these? God my head hurts. There's a tip basket on the nightstand. I'll leave them some nails. My friend gave me some so I could enter this place.



The TV and radio doesn't work but the water does, a nice hot bath sounds good. I soaked till my fingers pruned. What are these wishes my friend told me about? I remember in blurry fractions a campfire, a couple beers, we were trading stories with a few others. We were just shooting the shit when he told me about this place. Said the road appeared after 3am and that is was just north of Fort Sumner. I believed him, or rather I wanted to believe him.



I slept. For how long I didn't know. After waking I decided to write everything down. Whatever this place is, isn't right. Its messing with me, its fucking with my mind. The nails I put in the basket are gone and there's cooked breakfast on the kitchen table. I don't remember anyone else coming in. I'm not eating that. Things are happening. I'm struggling to process past events from current ones. I want to leave I think.



I carefully opened my door; the hallway is, was different. It was dark still but wasn't like the one I walked through earlier when I arrived. It looked lived in. There were numerous pieces of furniture, seating arrangements, tables, bowls of fruit, an old tube TV, a radio, lamps over a century old, portraits of strangers, all kinds of stuff everywhere. The elevator is gone. Instead the hallway splits at the end into two, each with a door. A filing cabinet also sits at the end of the hall. It had a neatly typed piece of paper laying on it.



“Make your choice.” It read.



“Do you prefer red or blue?” was written below it. I looked and saw one door had 'Red' carved on it and on the other 'Blue'.



I opened the one that read blue. Its my favorite color after all. What I saw made my stomach turn. It was the same hall with everything identically placed but the walls were painted blue. The door locked behind me. Not that I want to open it. I hear something when I press my ear against it. Heavy steps and labored breathing. I ran to the end of that hall to find that same filing cabinet with that same paper on it. “Make your choice.” it read.



“Do you prefer your mother or father?” dread went racing down my back.



“Let me out!” I yelled to no response.



“Hey! Please I don't want to do this!” I screamed. Nothing again.



I stood for a hopeless moment. I pulled my phone out. Reception isn't right. Calls go out but I hear only static. I choose the door that had mother on it. Once again, same blue hall, but as I walked through it the TV shot on. I jumped and looked to see what was happening.



The quality of the film was poor but I could make out clips of news reports intermingled with, what looked like, snuff video of a women murdering a man in a living room. It was so graphic, the blood sprayed everywhere. I watched her play with the organs. I couldn't look away. Why couldn't I look away?



I heard the agonizing yell of a man reverberate behind me. It was so intense I fell and scanned the hall I was in. There's no one here. Fuck, there's no one. Would it be better if there was? I got up and ran to that same filing cabinet.



“Do you prefer hooks or needles?” the paper asked.



“What the hell do you mean?” I frantically uttered under my breath. “Am I going to get hurt? Is someone else going to be hurt?”



I went through the hooks door.



I was walking on the ceiling. I looked up and saw above me that same blue hall where everything was identically placed once again. Moving carefully I could hear the scrape of metal muffled under my feet, under the 'floor'. Something was below me. Before I could react bodies came bursting through the place below me. They were on hooks and were floating above me, dangling in reverse and pulled tight by the chain. In that moment I could feel my skin begin to itch and pull in directions by things I couldn't see. The pain grew slowly and I knew if didn't progress further it would only get worse. Next paper.



“Do you prefer fire or water?”



Easy I thought. I ran through the water door and was greeted by the same blue hall. Nothing unusual. A nice break I hoped. Then I saw her. A lanky elderly woman sat in a rocking chair. Her head was craned down, staring at the floor. I could feel my nerves screaming at me and as I began to navigate through. I prayed to myself she wouldn't move or wake up. However I was pulled in my mind. A tug of memory, do I know her? Strange. I don't want to find out. 



Moving through I felt a wet squish of carpet beneath me and looking down I could see the hall was beginning to flood. My pace quickened and as I reached the file cabinet the water had already reached my knees. I looked back, though I wish I didn't. The old woman was staring at me and immediately got up. Her form was massive, maybe eight feet tall. I yelled and turned to see my new choices.



“Do you prefer being chased or being watched?”



Watched it is. I threw the paper aside and could tell the old women was only a few feet away from me. Her cackle sent chills down my body as I struggled to open the door. The pressure of the flood pushing against me.



I need to get out of here I kept repeating. As I stumbled into the new hall the door shut itself and I was back once again in that hall. It was dark, much darker than before. I stumbled through and could feel the pressure of something else with me. I felt its breath on my neck. I'd turn only to see the small dark orange glow of two eyes look back at me. Just steps away. Whatever it was matched my pace as I backed away carefully. Thoughts that weren't my own flooded me. Thoughts of death, hatred, jealousy, pride, and so much more. It felt like I was splitting in half. I can't go on. There's heaviness in my chest. Eventually I bumped into the file cabinet again. My hands felt for the paper. The question was worded differently, more direct.



“Would you save you wife or your child?”



Nails.



A pain bolted through my head, sending me to my knees. Like an intense migraine. I saw the saturated glimpse of a mother and child at a picnic. I'm not married. I don't have a kid. Wife I guess. I crawled through that door. I felt sore.



I was outside? No, the hall was outside but wasn't at the same time. The trees ascended into a sightless abyss. The radio was playing music, though not well. I thought, no, I knew I saw someone fiddle with it as I walked though. I can hear the echoed laughter of people. Things are hazy. Where am I? I felt lost. I think I ran awhile.



Nails.



I'm tired and winded. How long did I run? I think I collapsed on the file cabinet and bashed my head against one of its knobs. I know I felt warm blood stream down my forehead. Are you reading this? The page says.



“Will you torture me?”



I need to go back I thought. I pushed against those drawers, propping myself up. I need to get out of here. I need more nails. The other way is gone. The hallway is shifting, has shifted, and moves when I try to look at it. Sounds I can't describe slide away from me. There isn't a door anymore, its gone. Only the body of a child I never knew. I fell before it and wept. I don't know why or who it was but I felt my heart ripped out when I looked upon its face. The face looked like mine but different. Feelings of deep regret and sorrow welled up inside me. Nails were pressed into its eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.



I am laying on a floor next to a corpse. I can't see much anymore. The battery on my phone is dying. I don't know if this will reach anyone. Please help me. Please come spend a night at the the Nails Motel.
