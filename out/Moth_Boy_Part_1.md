\[Part 1\] - \[[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ml9de6/moth_boy_part_2/)\]

I’ve been reluctant to do this for many years. Friends and family have asked me to tell them about the Moth Boy for years, but I’ve declined. Perhaps they think I just have a creepy anecdote, or a fun factoid. Not a lot of people know I’ve been there since the beginning.

For reasons that will become apparent, I’ve been motivated to look closer at my experience with this person. Moth Boy. A stupid nickname. Funny, even. Like a sidekick to an insectoid superhero.

But I think we need to start at the very beginning.

 

The year was 2004. I was part of an investigation; a missing babysitter at a foster home. It was peculiar, but not necessarily sinister. We’d had some calls about that home in the past, but it was mostly just kids being kids. Neighbors complaining about noise and the occasional broken window.

This was different.

The foster home sheltered six kids from troubled backgrounds. The parents had to leave town for a family emergency and had paid for a pair of babysitters to help in the meantime. These weren’t just any babysitters either, they were friends of the family and well-known to the children. Familiar faces.

Let’s call her Vicky. Vicky had arrived at the house Thursday afternoon. She was to stay there until Sunday, when the other sitter would come by. Vicky was there to help with cooking, cleaning, keeping an eye on the kids, and making sure the older ones got to school okay. But when the other sitter arrived on Sunday, she found Vicky’s car still in the driveway – and the kids had been on their own since late Friday.

We were immediately called in. This was not just about a missing person; there was a full home of kids involved.

 

I have a background in child psychology. I was fresh out of college and had a penchant for westerns. I wanted to be the white hat who rode into town and cleared things up. Being a shoulder to lean on, and a hand to hold when the going gets tough. That wasn’t quite my job description, but what we do and what we *want* to do are rarely the same thing.

By the time I got to the Wheeler foster home, the place was packed with cars. The foster parents had come back just a couple of hours earlier, and it was full pandemonium inside. Some kids weren’t emotionally ready to be interviewed yet, and others didn’t know what was going on. Some of them had enjoyed being unsupervised. I could tell from one of the broken windows and the hockey puck on the driveway.

Police were searching the area, interviewing neighbors, knocking on doors for witness testimonies; whatever they had to do to find this girl. But the key to the puzzle were the kids themselves. Someone must have seen something. It was clear that she’d been there, so where did she go? When?

 

There were three boys and three girls. The oldest was 14, the youngest was 7. It was a nice place; a two-story house with plenty of space. Two rooms on the top floor for the kids where they bunked up three by three. A large living room on the bottom floor with double glass doors leading to a backyard. There was a trampoline and a deflated outdoor pool, waiting to be put away. A well-used ashtray on a white plastic garden table next to a grimy grill. Lighter fluid out in the open.

There were two smaller television sets in two of the kids’ rooms. An Xbox for the boys, a GameCube for the girls, both accompanied by well-worn and Cheeto-stained beanbags. It looked cozy; the kind of thing you’d have to pry a kid away from with bribes and promises. The place was a mess, but not a neglectful one. It was the kind of mess that shows life.

As I was walking through the boys’ room, I noticed a pitter-patter on the window. Looking a little closer, I saw moths. Not big ones, like the ones with eyes on the wings. No, these were smaller. One, maybe one and a half inch, at most.

“You noticed them too?”

One of my colleagues, Officer Norton.

“Found a couple in every room,” he continued. “They’re not native to the area.”

“Probably snuck along in a suitcase.”

“Or maybe they just attract that kind of attention.”

 

It was an unusual detail. Spongy moths, an invasive species. The Wheelers would probably have to get the exterminators; it was pretty serious. But invasive critters aside, there wasn’t much to say for Vicky’s disappearance. At least not at first glance. There was no sign of a struggle, and the kids had managed fine without her. They’d cleaned out the snack shelf and eaten two full boxes of ice cream sandwiches, but apart from a stomachache they’d be fine.

I would begin my interviews later that day. All under supervision, and with the foster parents in the next room, of course. I would try to build some rapport with the children, mentioning how I noticed their games and telling them of some of my own. I asked about their favorite shows, how they were doing in school, and what their favorite things to do around the house was. All little talking points to put things in perspective. It was all preliminary.

Most of them were fine talking to me. Happy, even. There was this younger girl, Hayden, who blasted off into this long rant about her friends at school and the many things she wanted to do when she grew up. It’s like she just needed an excuse, and she was off to the races. Others, like 7-year-old Brandon, found the whole thing unpleasant. He couldn’t bring himself to speak. But after a couple of bribes and some time to warm up, he confided in me;

“I think Herman did it,” he said. “Herman’s a weird one.”

 

Herman. That’s the name people see in the papers. Not Moth Boy. Herman.

10-year-old Herman was the newest member of the Wheeler foster home, having been there only half a year. The first time I saw him, he was sitting in the corner of the living room, lodged between a TV bench and a bookshelf. If you didn’t know where to look, you’d barely notice him. He was quite large in stature for a kid his age. He had this sandy blonde hair with gray eyes. I could see them all the way across the room. He had this expression of a cat on the prowl, with eyes wide open and pupils wide.

He was just sitting there, staring ahead, as another moth tapped on the window to my right.

“Hey there, Herman,” I said, walking up to him. “You mind talking to me for a bit?”

I held out a hand and introduced myself. Herman shook it, and I felt this intense warmth. Then, movement. A twitch. I pulled back, only to see he’d put a caterpillar in my hand. The thing had these cactus-like spikes digging into my skin as it rolled back and forth. My hand flared up like I’d been stung by a wasp.

I dropped the caterpillar and crushed it. Herman didn’t seem to mind. His expression didn’t change.

 

I tried to have a conversation with him, but he didn’t respond. It was only later that evening that I learned from one of the older girls that Herman didn’t speak. Not just as in he spoke quietly – he never spoke *at all*. I asked his foster parents about it, and they mentioned him being an unusual case.

“We don’t know what happened before he came to us,” they explained. “They just found him.”

I don’t know where my instincts come from, but I felt something. We weren’t going to find Vicky with a thorough search or a surprise witness at the 11^(th) hour. No, we had an answer in Herman. I don’t know why, but something was telling me that behind those gray doll-like eyes was an answer.

I remember leaving the Wheeler home with a strange gut feeling. It was like an anxious stone in the pit of my stomach. Like I’d seen something awful, but my mind was playing catch-up with my eyes.

I saw Herman in the window of the second floor, looking my way. And even from a distance, I could see three moths fluttering around him. I waved goodbye, but he didn’t wave back.

 

I think it was officer Norton who first characterized him as “Moth Boy”. He said something akin to;

“We talked to every kid in there and got *nothing*. Well, not moth boy. We didn’t talk to him.”

Herman was suspected to be the cause of the moth infestation in the Wheeler home. They’d begun to show up around the time of his arrival, and they were apparently very common around spaces where he spent the most time. Hence the Moth Boy moniker. It caught on.

Even after one visit to the Wheeler home, I’d start to find larvae in my clothes. Mostly my pockets. These little black segmented things, waving their bodies back and forth like pool noodles. I dropped everything I wore into the dryer just to make sure I got them all, but I still had chills for the rest of the night. Like I could feel them on my body. And looking at the swelling on my hand, I knew these things would be a problem if they made a foothold.

 

Vicky was still missing. The search area was expanded, with a particular focus on the nearby interstate. The current working theory was that she was either coaxed out of the house and kidnapped, or left with someone willingly. There was no working theory as to what exactly would have made her do that. She had a boyfriend, but he was out looking for her just like everyone else.

The next day we took a more structured approach. I was part of a team of people who were interviewing the kids one by one in greater detail. I got the three boys, while one of my colleagues got the three girls. We tried to create a calming environment, using our most colorful rooms and a couple of toys and comics to make it all look a bit more friendly.

First one I sat down with was 12-year-old Sal. Latin American kid with his head on a swivel. I could tell he didn’t want to be there, his eyes kept rolling at me like a bobblehead. I asked him about Vicky, about when she went missing, what they did when they noticed she was gone – and he wasn’t very receptive to the topic.

“We played games,” he said. “We had cold pizza and sandwiches.”

It wasn’t until I mentioned the other boys that I saw a tinge of something uncertain in his face. He didn’t have much to say about Brandon, more than that he was “cool”, but talking about Herman was a whole other thing.

 

Sal looked down when I mentioned him. He didn’t roll his eyes or shrug the question off.

“You have a good relationship with Herman?” I asked.

“No,” Sal said. “No one does.”

“Why do you say that?”

“He’s a freak.”

“What makes him a freak?”

Sal leaned back and crossed his arms. And without looking up, he seemed to open a little.

Sal had been with the Wheelers for four years. Ever since Herman showed up, things had changed. William, the father figure of the home, had started smoking. Julia, on the other hand, had started day-drinking.

“Not a lot”, Sal clarified. “But you notice. It’s the stress.”

 

Sal described Herman as ‘creepy’. He explained in detail how he’d notice Herman skulking around the house when people slept, or when he thought no one was looking. Herman would never eat at the dinner table, instead packing his food into a Tupperware box and running away.

“And the bugs,” Sal said, shaking his head. “They’re gross, and they sting. I gotta vacuum my bed once a week. They changed mattress three times, but they keep coming back.”

Herman would never smile. He would never talk.

“Have you seen anyone bully him?” I asked. “A lot of kids like that get bullied.”

“Once,” Sal said. “I saw someone pushing him into a puddle. But they don’t do that anymore.”

“Why not?”

Sal shook his head, trying to find the words.

“It was months ago. Herman hit him with a water balloon. There was blood in it.”

I wanted to ask, but I could tell there was more. Sal took a deep breath, looking up from the floor. He didn’t want to talk anymore. At least not about Herman.

Brandon had similar stories. Herman seemed to have no filter. They’d once seen him dangling a rattlesnake by the tail, playing with it. He would poke around little insect nests, hoping to attract venomous spiders. Even things like barbecue could be made creepy, as Herman would admire the sizzling meat – but not out of hunger. He just seemed to like the sound. One of few things that made him happy, it seemed. Very happy.

“He spent two days with a branch once,” Brandon said. “He took his shoelaces, wrapped them around it, and tugged. Like he was practicing.”

“Practicing what?”

“Strangling things.”

 

Before my interview with Herman, I looked up a couple of things from his file. His original family had abandoned him and changed their names. He had been found wandering the highway by patrolmen, and efforts to find his biological parents failed. No one came to claim him. Even the name Herman was a temporary placeholder that kinda stuck around. It was no more valid than his ‘Moth Boy’ nickname.

Herman did go to school but was part of a special education program. He seemed to pay attention in class, but they couldn’t get him to perform any tests or measurements. He wouldn’t play, and he wouldn’t respond when spoken to. They knew he could read and write, but it was hard to say at what level. He would usually draw. There were those suggesting he was on the autistic spectrum, but he didn’t seem to respond negatively to sudden or changing stimuli. In fact, he rarely responded to anything at all.

So before my interview, I prepared some paper and crayons. If Herman didn’t talk, maybe he would draw.

 

Herman arrived with little fanfare. His foster father waited outside, having a cigarette. Herman sat down across from me, folded his hands, and looked at me from across the table. He paid no attention to the paper and crayons. Just as I was about to ask him a question, I noticed him rubbing his arms.

“Are you cold?” I asked.

He nodded. I fetched my jacket and wrapped it over him. He didn’t smile, but he stopped moving.

“Better?”

Again, he nodded. I sat down across from him and pushed the stack of papers closer, along with the box of crayons. Now that I’d made it apparent that it was okay to use them, he immediately picked the red and black crayons.

“I’d like to ask about your babysitter Vicky,” I said. “Do you know anything about where she went?”

Herman didn’t acknowledge the question. Instead, he looked at the paper, then back up at me. He made a motion like he wanted something to drink, and then used a crayon to show a straw. It wasn’t much, but at least he was communicating.

 

I returned with a glass of lemonade; with a straw. Herman put the crayons down and sipped the straw, looking me straight in the eye with every gulp. Those gray, doll-like eyes.

“When was the last time you saw Vicky?” I asked. “Do you remember what she was doing?”

He nodded at me again, grabbing the black crayon. I thought he was about to draw something, but he wrote in all capital letters;

*VERY HAPPY*

“She was happy last time you saw her?”

He shook his head, pointing to himself.

“You were happy the last time you saw her?”

He nodded, and added the word *COOKING* to his paper.

“So she was cooking.”

Herman nodded enthusiastically.

“Then what happened?”

He thought about it for a while. Then he added the words *WENT HOME*. Curious.

 

I didn’t get much else from Herman. But from what I’d learned, Vicky had been cooking something and then ‘went home’. Of course, Herman couldn’t know that. Maybe he misinterpreted her leaving for her going home, giving some leniency to the working theory of her disappearing along the interstate.

I thought a lot about it as I drove home that night. There was still no word about Vicky and her whereabouts, but I shared my findings with the investigators. There wasn’t much to share; the children had been too preoccupied with their own antics and games to consider what had happened. They weren’t mean about it, but they’d been too busy to notice her absence until she was already gone. Now that she was missing, they all expressed concern about it. The girls had put on this friendship bracelet that Vicky helped them make.

Some of the officers involved with the case talked at length about the strange ‘Moth Boy’ of the Wheeler house. Not only were there plenty of rumors surrounding him, but they kept talking about him as if he was somehow responsible. He was a creepy kid; of course he had to be the source of trouble. That had to be it.

“He’s big for his age,” one of the officers noted. “Wouldn’t surprise me one bit.”

“He ain’t all there, that’s for sure.”

I wanted to say something, but I didn’t. I hadn’t made up my mind yet.

 

Coming home that night, I felt a strange warmth along my neck. The warmth turned to a searing heat, making me throw off my jacket, dropping it flat on my bathroom floor. I hadn’t even closed the front door.

And there they were, on the floor. Spongy moth larvae. Not just a couple, but dozens. Maybe hundreds. Shaking out the jacket, small balls of paper and chewed bread rolled out; something Herman had rolled up and planted in the jacket lining. He’d poked a hole in the inner left pocket and dropped the balls in there, making them almost impossible to notice.

That’s why he asked for the jacket. Not because he was cold, but because he wanted to plant these. I spent two hours steam-cleaning the bathroom. Exhausted, I sat down on my toilet, only to spot three more larvae along the trim of the walls. I had scrubbed, and steamed, and scrubbed again, and yet there they were. Just a couple, but more than enough.

It was long after 1 am when I called it a night. I’d put the jacket into a plastic bag, taken it outside, and burned it. And as I lay down to sleep, I kept waking up; imagining the pitter-patter of wings along the glass of my bedroom window.

 

The investigation continued for a couple of days. There was a lead about a woman looking like Vicky being caught on a camera at a gas station, but it turned out to be a false positive. Being back to square one, things started to look dim.

I managed to get some time with the foster parents, asking them about their experiences and suspicions. Turns out, Herman was the most immediate problem for the couple to tackle. They talked about how he’d bring them endless stress, and the constant cleaning needed to handle the moths was exhausting.

“I have no idea where they’re coming from,” the foster mother sighed. “It’s not the clothes, they’re washed three times a week. The kids aren’t dirty, they all shower daily. And yet, every day, something comes crawling out.”

The foster father had a different idea.

“He hides them,” he said. “Herman hides them. I’m telling you.”

 

We had a talk with the other babysitter. She ping-ponged between hysterical and cordial, making it hard to keep a coherent conversation. She painted this picture of Vicky as a promising young woman. Someone making extra money to get a place of her own as she went to nursing school. Vicky seemed perfectly pleasant, and there was no reason for anyone to hurt her. Sadly, that just meant she was more likely to be a victim.

The working theory was that her boyfriend had done something. Turns out he’d been lying about his whereabouts on Friday evening. Police were looking for him to bring him in for questioning, but he wasn’t officially charged with any crimes; yet. But there were signs that pointed in a very familiar direction.

It was possible, but then someone would have noticed. Sure, the kids were all about games and staying up all night, but not Herman. He *must* have seen something.

 

One late afternoon, I was writing up a summary for my supervisor. I had to wear some backup clothes, as the rest was in the dryer back home. I had this uncomfortable starchy shirt. It chafed in ways you don’t expect it to. I was about to finish up for the day when I got a call on my office phone.

I answered, introduced myself, and heard nothing. There was someone on the other end, but they didn’t say anything. I was suddenly aware of my breathing, like I could feel the hot air brush against the receiver.

“Is anyone there?” I asked.

There was a huffing noise. I furrowed my brow and listened. I could hear voices in the background. Children. But there was something else. Paper?

“Herman? Is that you?”

Two taps – a crayon against paper.

“Are you okay? Do you need something?”

Two taps.

“Can you give the phone to an adult? We’ll figure it out.”

One tap.

“Do you need help? Should we send someone?”

Two taps.

“Alright, someone’s coming. Hang tight.”

One immediate tap. He didn’t like that.

“Not that,” I clarified. “Alright. You want me to come?”

Two taps, clear as day.

 

I drove out there with two other officers. I didn’t mind racking up some overtime, but I could feel my skin itching at the thought of spending time with Moth Boy. It was like a Pavlovian response. I could feel something crawling across the hair on my arms, and I couldn’t tell if it was the late summer breeze or something about to sting me. Just thinking about it put me on edge, making my leg shake like I’d had too much coffee.

I arrived at the Wheeler house with a patrol vehicle. Officer Norton and his partner were my backup, staying a solid five steps behind with a practiced smile. The Wheelers were already up front. So was Herman, with a backpack.

“I’m so sorry,” said mama Wheeler. “We didn’t notice him calling until he hung up.”

“That’s fine,” I smiled. “I’m glad he feels comfortable talking to me.”

The foster father rolled his eyes. Perhaps that’s where Sal learned it.

“Did you want to talk, Herman? Is that it?”

Herman shook his head, holding up a paper. He’d scribbled the word *WALK*.

“Walk the walk, not talk the talk,” I said. “You wanna go somewhere?”

He nodded. The parents didn’t seem to mind, but there was a definite worry on their faces. Perhaps they weren’t used to Herman making a scene like this, or even communicating at all. I waved Herman over, but he shook his head. He knelt on the ground and dove in with his crayon Seconds later, he showed me a muddy paper. The new word was rough, but clear.

*ALONE*

Officer Norton kept a smile up, but I could tell he didn’t like it. Moth Boy was just a kid, but in some other way, he wasn’t.

 

Herman and I made our way on our own, following a trail leading past a bike road. We moved between houses, tracing a path that only a kid could figure out. A birds-eye route straight through a busy residential area. Herman kept his head down with steely-eyed determination.

“Do you have something to show me?” I asked, stepping over a white picket fence.

Herman nodded, pointing straight ahead.

“Is it about Vicky?”

He nodded again. Perhaps he knew who’d taken her, or a clue as to where she went. The thought struck me that I might have to come face to face with whoever was responsible. I had my service weapon, but I hadn’t considered that I might have to use it. Then again, Herman was a weird kid. Maybe he just wanted to show me a cool stick, or a treehouse.

 

We finally made it to our destination – a two-story house in a slightly nicer part of town. It was about a twenty-minute walk, but it would have taken twice as long if we’d taken a less optimal path. Herman stopped and held up a hand, asking me to wait while he wrote something down. As he did, I looked over at the house.

“Nice place,” I said. “You know the owners?”

Herman nodded, showing me his paper. It said *CHECK POOL*. He underlined it and pointed to the side of the house. Something in his demeanor had shifted, but it was hard to tell what. He wasn’t scared or angry. Not happy either. But there was a new eagerness there – something urgent. I followed his direction, taking point. It looked like the owners were out; there were no cars in the driveway. Late summer vacation, perhaps.

We followed the side of the house, opening into a big backyard. A large wooden deck with a scattering of folded sun chairs. Intricately detailed garden bushes barely clinging to life with an automated sprinkler. In the back, a gazebo - overlooking a pool covered with a tarp. It had this tacky corporate sunflower logo in a clear, sun-washed blue.

There was a security camera facing the backyard. I had to take that into consideration, maybe it’d caught someone. I could tell something was off, but I couldn’t put my finger on what. There was this cat across the yard that stared at us like it was about to attack. Perhaps it could feel the same tension that I did. But was it scared of me, or the infamous Moth Boy?

I looked back at Herman. He nodded, pointing to the pool and poking at the tarp. I pulled it back.

 

I was hit by this thick, acrid smell. Something so dense and instant that it felt like I’d swallowed a wad of charred hair. I reeled back, wheezing for air. The pool had been drained, leaving a hollow space of ceramic tiles. It almost looked like the water was still there, as the blue tint of the sunflower logo gave the light a watery twist.

There was something at the deep end. Something black. I could hear a strange noise coming from it, but I couldn’t tell what it was. A droning hiss, like a white noise machine. Buzzing.

I moved to the side, looking down. I couldn’t tell what it was, even now. Maybe I didn’t want to understand.

“What is this?” I asked. “How did you find it?”

I looked up at Herman. He’d written two words.

*VICKY. COOKING.*

 

My heart sank through my stomach as I noticed the details. The curled fingers. Legs popped like overcooked sausages. And there, if you looked at just the right angle – a skull, locked in a mouth-wide scream. I could see the edge of her spine poking through her burned clothes.

I yelled at Herman to move away and made my way down the pool ladder. I had my phone in my hand before I realized what I was doing. I had to get backup. I had to get backup *now*. My thoughts raced as my poor excuse for shoes almost lost me my footing on the slippery tiles. I called out for Officer Norton, trying to tell him the address. I knew the street, but the number wasn’t making sense to me. The only number I could think of was four – the number of teeth I could see sticking out from the charred remains.

“We have a body,” I repeated. “We have a body. A body. And I don’t know if-“

A trickle. Something wet. Rain? Couldn’t be. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky.

 

Herman was standing at the edge of the pool. He was holding a bottle of lighter fluid. In his other hand; a zippo lighter. The flame was lit. Even as I looked at him, he continued pouring. My eyes burned as the chemicals made their way up my nose.

“Herman,” I said. “What are you doing?”

He dropped the bottle unceremoniously, reaching for his scrunched-up paper. Still holding the lighter, he tapped a word. *COOKING*.

“Are you gonna hurt me, Herman?”

He nodded.

“I didn’t do anything to you,” I said. “I thought we were friends.”

I tried to keep my words simple, but it felt wrong talking to him like that. This was no ordinary kid – you couldn’t reason with him. He didn’t listen the way others did, and he didn’t care. Even looking at the charred remains of his babysitter, there was no visible reaction. He might as well have watched the clouds go by.

“Herman,” I said. “I need you to step back. Others are coming soon. I’m on the phone with them right now. This is very serious.”

But he didn’t step back. He didn’t put out his lighter. I could promise him a house swarming with police officers, and he wouldn’t bat an eye. Because by the time they got there, he would’ve already won.

 

I pulled out my gun.

Never in a thousand years had I thought I’d be pointing it at a kid, but I did.

“Put it away, now,” I snapped. “Do it!”

The flame stayed lit, and he wasn’t budging. He stretched his arm out, holding the lighter with two fingers like a dainty dame with a fine cup of tea. Safety was off. I could do it. One wrong pull of a muscle, and I’d be the man who shot a 10-year-old.

“Last chance!” I demanded. “Last chance, Herman!”

My legs were shaking. I could feel a cramp coming on as my muscles tensed up. My mouth was wide-open, sucking in air like a funnel.

He dropped the lighter.

 

My mind split in two. In one world, I shot Herman in the head. In the other, I dove to forward catch the lighter before it hit the ground. They were both valid options, but something in the world pushed me towards the second reality. Perhaps in some other place, the outcome would have been different.

I missed the lighter, but it didn’t matter. It landed with the top down, closing itself with a click.

For a couple of seconds, I just lay there next to the charred remains. My world was nothing but chemicals and coal. I couldn’t get my body to stop shaking. I’d been the flick of a lighter from going up in flames.

I brushed away an insect, then another one. It didn’t take me long to realize that Vicky was infested with them. And there, around her neck, something burned but unmistakable.

Shoelaces.

 

I climbed out of the pool. Herman was just sitting on a sun chair with his papers, writing. The cat had made its way across the yard and curled up by his feet. I didn’t even realize I was still holding my gun. I figured I could still do it, if I wanted to. One pop, and a lot of drama would be over. This wasn’t just a kid, he was something else entirely. Something I’d only read about in solemn worst-case scenario profiles during training. Perhaps I’d be doing everyone a favor.

Before I could say anything, Herman showed me another thing he’d written.

*VERY HAPPY*

Of course he was. There were sirens in the distance, and he couldn’t care less.

“You killed her.”

He nodded.

“Why?”

He thought about it for a second. He turned to his papers, making a few practiced strokes. He gave the paper to me; a smiley face. No words, this time.

I escorted him to the front of the building to meet up with the officers. As we walked, I felt something. He was holding my hand. Not to plant a caterpillar in my palm, but because hands is what kids are supposed to do. They were supposed to hold people’s hands when the going gets tough. That’s what Moth Boy was working with; assumptions. I think that’s the first moment I saw him for what he truly was; a pretender.

Until the moment those flashing lights came around the corner, I contemplated pulling the trigger. Like I had some cosmic option to end lifetimes of pain.

But I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

 

The aftermath was awful.

There was the fallout of the family being informed, but also the devastation of the Wheeler foster home. Not to mention the house where Vicky had been burned. Remember I mentioned Moth Boy having been bullied once? Yeah, the kid who did that? It was his family house. They had to move, they couldn’t stay in a house where someone had been burned.

And yes, she’d been alive. There was a security camera overlooking the backyard. Herman had tricked Vicky there, showing her some text on a piece of paper. As they got to the edge of the pool, he held up a necklace with a shiny rock. Vicky had clapped her hands excitedly and turned around for him to put it on. As she did, he switched the necklace for his shoelaces. Then he struck.

He did some real damage in those first few seconds. Herman is larger than most kids his age, and Vicky was smaller than the average adult woman. After a short struggle, she stumbled into the empty pool, and Herman let her go. Using the lighter fluid from his foster father’s grill, and a zippo lighter, the camera showed a sudden burst of light.

And Herman just stood there. Very happy.

 

I didn’t stay up to date with the court rulings that came after that. I heard he was locked away. I just wanted him out of my life. Thinking about him reminded me that I was the kind of person who’d shoot anyone to save myself. It put this stain on my mind, like I was the most selfish person in the world. I kept Herman’s smiley face paper as a reminder. I don’t know why. Maybe to torture myself.

For weeks after last seeing him, I would still get these incessant moths fluttering around my apartment. They would stay there for a couple years until I moved to a new apartment. I think it took two full years before I finally got rid of them. I’d hoped that would be a turning point, making me forget the Moth Boy once and for all. And I guess, for a while, it worked.

But it wouldn’t last. Because much like his namesake, Herman was impossible to truly get rid of.

Like midnight pitter patter against my bedroom window.
