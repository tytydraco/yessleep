Story and narration by Erica M. 

'My mother, during her tenure at Pitt, had once shared an apartment in lower Oakland with her best friend. One night she was awakened from a dream, only to find the source of it, a tall man in a brimmed rain hat, brooding over top of her with fiery eyes and knotted lips, curled into a baleful sneer which, if it had been a cartoon, might have been as humorous as it was terrifying. The ineffable expression on his face, his lurching, Marfan-like posture, and bulging, shadow-casted eyes instilled in her an irrational fear she would pass on to her children as an indisputable tenet - sleep with a weapon. Always.  Baseball bat, fire poker, or any hard and blunt object you can comfortably nestle up to. "You cant trust a soul in this world", she would ironically dictate. This lopsided fear was mostly actuated by a parallel experience to the former - she woke up one winter night to find a burglar looming over her in that very same bed.  

She screamed, and yet, her clamorous alert didn't deter him from twisting his lips into a sickening grin, the ordeal capped by a sly wink of the eye. He exited hastily before she could call police. What's even more bizarre is the fact that the intruder hadn't swiped a thing. All of her possessions remained in their rightful places.  Perhaps the experience might not have beem so irreparably traumatizing had she not been alone.  Her roommates had already left for Christmas break, and mom wasn't planning on departing for another two days.  Upon later inspection she would be left scratching her head and arching her brows - no windows were left opened, and she clearly recalled locking the door from the inside before going to bed.  Augury?  Omen?  Or just coincidence?  A paranormal soiree had preceded this years before.

When she was a little girl, often during summer nights, a form would appear at the far end of the property, watching intently from the tree line.  The latent figure, which she would describe as "partially transparent", was one of a little girl wearing a pale, downy dress, "like she was ruffled with dove's feathers".  Not one of her siblings had ever witnessed anything, ultimately dismissing the claimant's visions as a wistful misinterpretation or an outright lie.  She saw the girl often, but always at a distance.  Her grandfather, at the time ailing from frequent bouts of pneumonia, and essentially house-ridden, would accede to her that neither ghosts nor souls exist.  

My mother persisted obstinately with her claims, now alleging that this august, semi-transparent child, meditative and fit for placid staring contests, had, every few nights, been inching closer and closer to the house.  It was winter now, and these purported visions drastically increased in frequency. The cold was brooding, winds gnashed against the groaning walls, the eaves drooled with frozen spears, and the outsides of the windows deluged with half an inch of carmelized ice, presenting good cause for the argument of illusion. On more than one occasion, having pained herself to willingly suspend any and all belief that this "apparition" was no more than a corporeal child of the neighborhood, my mother had swiped her sister's shawl from the rack and trampled out into the fallen snow to throw it around the shoulders of the diaphanous and hardly formidable little destitute, which, in a space of seconds, always had vanished.  

Soon my mother would cease her fanciful musings altogether and retreat to her room, burying herself in books and toiling over her oil canvas paintings of ravens, reposed inside the faint naturally lit gloom of pale blue evenings and grey, laminar skies, quietly seething with a tangibly disquieting sentiment proffered her in dreams through the conduit of a small, softly balanced voice: "I'll be there soon".

Apotheosis of this insular tension swept in fiercely one ordinary night. Grandpa was a jovial soul, but in all of his living years, if he could will himself to believe less in anything in the world than he could Santa Claus, it was ghosts.  His conviction of the matter might even be considered dogged, since grandma had died in that very house less than a year prior to this night, and if there was anything he'd have loved to have believed in more than anything, it would be to see or speak to her again.  His inveterate derision regarding the very idea of the incorporeal was rooted in this enduring, lifelong subsistence of the beloved and the vanished.  As he lay supine, sunken into the polyester sinkhole of HIS recliner, drifting between a doze and a peek, the living room saturated in dull perennial blue despite the various dancing colors projected from the idiot box, something off into the darkness of the dining room, the entryway stretched eight feet off to his righthand periphery, stirred him from his indolence.

"Cassie, get back to bed!  Don't you know I catch *everything???*.  I know you're stealing cookies, and if I catch ya a-laughin' I'm gonna give ya a-wrappin'!".  He shut his eyes but was again roused by a sudden attack of sense - the sixth.  Not a smell nor touch nor taste nor sight, but something he'd ever struggle to intepret.  He shook himself lucid and turned toward the darkness, briefly cadging an impression before *Cassie* sauntered beyond the eclipse of the wall, deeper into the kitchen.  Propping himself on his cane and groaning against the ache suffused throughout his limbs, he lumbered toward the dining room, stopped a moment to peek inside, that gut-deep rousing percolating, the darkness becoming a lurid interloper.

To the immediate right the adiaphane shapes of the room stood harsh and erect, shaped only by a dim skein of faraway floodlights over a neighboring yard, but one thing stood out clearly - the girl in white.  The table in the kitchen, separate from and smaller than the dining room table, rested in the middle of the room, and was oval-shaped.  Grandpa squinted and flitted his eyes until they filled with water, dabbing it off with a hanky and drawing his glasses from his breast pocket.  "Who is that?  Cassie?  What could possibly have gotten into your head that you might tease and play little games at this hour!  And with grandpap Earl!  You understand the trouble youre in???"  But the girl stood her ground opposite his side of the table, her eyes dark, as if projected inward, arms at her sides, brunette drapery framing her face, which hed begun to notice as all too unfamiliar.  As grandpa limped his way around the table she moved herself likewise, and they began playing a little game of chase which resumed only a minute or two.

Grandpa stopped, and, as mom recalls, when he was about to lose his wits and burst into a hollering fit, there was this morsel of a moment where his veins ran through and through with ice.  It was her nose.  My mother and her siblings, had they one distinction to match all else, it was their dimpled little specks of noses.  The nose on this girl resembled a beak on any number of moms paintings.  Blighted with latent chest pains, in a state of disbelief to rival his hitherto unbelief, the girl suddenly started again, clamped lips growing full to a grin, rounding the table in a swift gale as if trying to catch hold of him.  The temperature in the room had ushered frost to the inside of the panes.  The chase recommenced, only now she the hunter and grandpa the hunted.  

Scared out of his wits, he lumbered around the table one revolution after another as the ghost moved faster, running without stepping, producing no audible sound.  The distance closing between them, grandpa made haste for the living room and the stairs, falling once on his face, juddering the foundation of the whole house, and cried out at the top of his lungs.  Mom and Cassie had been roused by it, and within seconds grandpa burst through the door only to find all of his grandchildren in their beds.  Mom said that the most terrifying thing she'd ever seen was a the visage of man so incapable of being terrified looking so terrified.  His head was lustrous with sweat, skin pale as the pollarded cedars outside, breathing intensely labored, irresolute and resolute at once.  

Mom cried out.  The others bestirred and the little ones tearing querulously at the image of an unbreakable, broken protector.  Doubled with his hands on his knees, he removed his hat he slept in and wore day to night every day for three decades and heaved and heaved.  Mom already knew, but lest she be reprimanded, she kept her mouth shut, Cassie looking at her for the very comment she would conceal.  "Just wanted to make sure you all were okay".  "What's the matter, pa?", said Cassie.  "Nothing, nothing.  Go back to sleep".  

It's here that mother ceases her yarn and directs us to summer, when the house was put up for sale, and, mom being nineteen, all eventually had moved in with her.  Grandpap moved in with our aunt Gerty.  Admonition would fall upon anyone who questioned him about that night thereafter, but aunt Gerty would secretly spin that story to me when I would ask her about it.  Evidently he illustrated the event to her in fine detail.  Aunt Gerty believed every word of it, even if she believed nothing else that had ever come out of his mouth.  Most of the time he'd "go white with terror" and halt the story midway.

Grandpa died before I was born, but my mother has insisted that of a lifetime of little gained idiosyncrasies, there was another that had only presented itself around the end of his life - an immutable tick - all throughout every day, be it dawn or dusk, had you stopped to look at him for even a minute, you'd scarcely ever catch him *not* looking over both shoulders'.

Thank you, Erica.
