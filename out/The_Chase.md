When I was seven years old, my parents took me to the pound where we found a two year old white furred German shepherd. We named him Jason and took him home with us. He lived indoors but dad had refurbished the old shed into a dog house for him to stay in when he wanted to stay out overnight so he could chase the occasional rabbit or raccoon that snuck in the backyard. Jason become welcomed by the other kids in the cul-de-sac and played along with us. In the fields we would play war and Jason would sniff out ‘landlines’. Some of the kids would come over to my house after school just to play with him and some of the neighbors would gave him treats when they pass by. Everyone loved him, which made it all the harder when he went missing.

One Friday night, me and my dad were watching a movie when Jason, who was laying the floor in front of us, suddenly ran to the sliding glass door and started barking and whining as he pad the glass. Figuring he saw another raccoon my dad let him outside. Hours later, I grew tired and decided to go to bed, before I did I called for Jason to come inside, but he refused to. I didn’t think much of it and let him stay outside. When I woke up the next morning Jason was gone, despite the fact the backyard fence door was locked and Jason never jumped the fence before. My dad was already looking for him, asking neighbors if they say him and soon the whole neighborhood spent days looking for him. Jason wasn’t the only pet that went missing, over the last few months other people’s dogs and even a few cats went missing, never to come back. And so, after a week of searching, my parents and everyone else gave up and accepted that he was gone. But I didn’t because I knew one place to look where no one else did. 

&#x200B;

On my tenth birthday, my uncle bought me a miniature dirt bike. I would ride it around the neighborhood and when I started middle school my parents let me ride to and from school. On some weekends though, me and Jason would go to the outskirts of town to an old country club with a huge golf course. Apparently, twenty years before I was born, a fire broke out at the country club house, killing more than 20 people in process. Its been abandon ever since and the land was surrounded by a fence, but there were many openings created by animals or bad weather throughout the years. The golf course sloped with many rolling hills and was around the size of three football fields. Jason loved it there, he would ran around in the wide open space like a marathon dog, chasing butterflies, rabbits, and even deers that prance through while I practice doing jumps over the rolling hills. One third of the golf course was separated from the rest by a river. Years back, a nearby dam burst and flooded the golf course making a river. On the top of the golf course they are two hills on either side of the river. I often thought of jumping across but never dared to. That was too far of a jump and if I broke my arm or leg my parents wouldn’t let me hear the end of it. 

&#x200B;

No one knew that me and Jason went to the golf course and it was the only place where he can possibly be. So, three days after everyone stopped looking for Jason, I sneaked out of the house around midnight. After I checked to make sure that my parents were dead asleep, I went to the garage to get my dirt bike but didn’t dare start up till I was a block or two away. The sky was clear, the moon was full and huge, casting its light leaving me without the need for a flashlight. 

&#x200B;

I made it to the outskirts of town and to the golf course. The fence surrounding it was almost covered with foliage. I came to the gate Jason and I usually sneak in through, it was covered with vines and the chains that once kept it closed were rusted and lay on the ground uselessly. I saw that the gate was slightly opened which gave me hope that I was at the right place. I rode around in the first part of the golf course calling Jason’s names hoping the sound of my dirt bike would attract him. I rode up near the burned down country club house thinking that he might have taken shelter. More than half of the country house had been burned down in the fire and the rest barely stood up from wear and tear over the years. People said that tramps and drug heads squatted there which is the reason that my folks didn’t want me to go there. After a few minutes of revving my engine, I decided that he wasn’t there and decided to cross over to the over side. To get to the other side of the river I have to leave through another gate, cross a short wooden bridge, and through another gate on the other side. 

&#x200B;

I rode down the larger part of the golf course passing sand lots and tall pine trees that cast long shadows in the moonlight. Suddenly I saw movement from the corner from my eye and turned to see a large dark shape dart from under the tree heading downwards. At first, I though it might have been Jason, but second guessed it figuring it may have been fawn or a coyote. Regardless, I followed it, hoping it would lead me to Jason. I tailed after it by several yards so I wouldn’t scare it off. Upon closer inspection, I saw that it was a hound with black fur. I was sure it was one of the missing dogs from the neighborhood. It lead me to the part of the gate where the foliage grow into a miniature forest, forming a dark cave of bushes and vines. 

&#x200B;

The hound started to slow to a walk and I soon followed slowing my bike to a stop. I parked my bike and stood a good distance away. Something wasn’t right. The minute I came here, I couldn’t shake off this ominous feeling that grew in my stomach. Maybe it was because I was here alone at night, but it wasn’t just that. I can’t help but feel I was being watched, or rather stalked. The hound stop near the mouth of the forest cave and stood rather still. Then dozen of small lights shined in the darkness, bobbin back and forth as they grew closer. It wasn't till they entered the moonlight that I realized that those lights were eyes. Dozens of hounds appeared from the darkness, all their eyes were on me. They are were as tall as Great Danes, faces like that of greyhounds, and there ears were long and pointed like Dobermans. Their fur was charred black, their eyes were like embers, and their tongues were red, bright red. What worse was their smiles, it wasn’t a goofy dog smile I was accustomed to. It was more like a human smile. The mouths stretched back and crooked upwards, revealing their tooth, their human teeth.

&#x200B;

I stood absolutely still. At that moment I forgot about why I came here, I forgot about Jason, and I didn’t even cared if I got in trouble for leaving at the dead at night. All I cared about was getting out of here. The hounds were still a good distance away, I knew I could make it to my dirt bike but I didn’t want to spur them into action. Without taking my eyes off them, I backed away, but as the my foot touched the ground the hounds started to charge towards me. I turned and ran, nearly tripping, but managing to jump on my bike and floored the acceleration. For a second the front wheel lifted of the ground before riding up the golf course. I heard the sound of snapping jaws nearly graze my back. 

&#x200B;

After a minute, I manage to calm down enough to look behind me. The hounds were still following me, even though I got a good distance between us, they were starting to close the gap. A thought came into my head saying that they lure on the end of the slope so I wouldn’t go as fast. Two hounds in the front were the first to catch up to me. They were starting to flank me. The one of my left was the closet, snapping at me. I was tempted to kick it but was worried that my leg would caught in its jaws. Moving away I was met with snarling on the right. I thought I was trapped but then I saw that we were coming up to an tree and I had an idea. I slow the acceleration, I needed a burst of speed for what I was about to do. The two started to close in on me and, in the last second, I floored the gas. The dog on my right, who was focused on me,  slammed into the tree. I drifted to the left to avoid the tree and as I did my back wheel slammed into the dog on my left. 

&#x200B;

When I cleared past the tree I turned back to see the pack running around the tree still after me. As they were gaining, I notice in the middle that there was a big one barreling through the others. This one was the size of a horse, its body was coving with aged scars, one over its left eye leaving it blind. It must’ve been the alpha. We were coming up onto the rolling hills and I started to jump them. As I did many of the hounds fell clumsily jumping after me, but the alpha was gaining and soon in the league. As I came up to another hill I took off my helmet, holding it by the straps. Riding a bicycle one handed was easy but on a dirt bike was cutting it a bit close. I steadied the bike as I rode up the hill preparing for the jump. Soon after I was in the air the alpha followed, it was hovering above me. I swung the helmet over my head and felt it come in contact with the hound’s jaw. I let the helmet fall from my hand and held onto both handles. I manage to land safely as the hound fell on its side. 

&#x200B;

I was reaching the top of the golf course when I came to a horrifying realization. I wouldn’t be able to leave through the gate. I would have to stop to re-open it and they’ll be all over me before I can start up my bike. As I came to this conclusion, I soon saw that I was coming up to the two hills on either of the river and made a rash decision. I immediately turned to the right, drifted a bit, then sped off to the upcoming hill. My little turn allowed the pack to catch up with me. The were tailing me, inches from my wheels, snarling, snapping at me. For a second I was wondered they tried biting at my tire. Before I knew it I jumped the hill. 

&#x200B;

As I soared in the air I looked down, I saw my reflection in the river illuminated by the moon. I looked up in time prepare for the landing. My bike hit the ground and bounced once, I bounced again but this time I fell over to my side. I slide on the ground for a good ten seconds before coming to a stop. My arm and leg was scratched up but nothing was broken. My bike was fine as well thank goodness. I got up and looked on the other side of the golf course. Some of the hounds fell in the river jumping after me, getting swept up by the current. The others were barking rabidly at me, mouth foaming red with blood. I was tired, my body was banged up and I wanted go home and put this whole experience behind me. 

&#x200B;

I slowly got back on my bike when I caught sight of the Alpha leaping over the river and managed to just land on the other side. I pushed away my exhaustion and kick started my bike. I was riding down the slope catching up sped but so was the alpha. I left the gate I came through open but was worried I wouldn’t make it in time. The alpha was gaining, I could feel its breath on my back. Then another hound came from through the upcoming gate and charged towards me. This hound was not as big as the alpha but larger the other ones and something red was around its neck. Before I could move out of the way it lunge towards me. I ducked as it flew over my head. It dove at the Alpha and they both crashed and rolled on the ground before getting back up and jumped at each others throats. I grind to a stop and looked at the two behemoths fighting each other. I looked closely at the smaller one and noticed what was around its neck. It was a red spiked collar with a golden tag, Jason’s collar. Whenever the Alpha tried run towards me, Jason would cut it off and resume the fight. As much as I wanted to stay, as much as I wanted to call out to Jason, I knew I stay for long. With a heavy heart, I turned and left through the gate. As I drove away, I could still hear the fight continue and several long howls drifting into the night.

&#x200B;

When I got home, my parents were still asleep so I made my way to the bathroom to clean up my arm and leg before crashing to bed and drifting off to sleep. When I woke the next morning I put on long sleeves shirt and pants to hide my bandages despite the summer heat. After my parents left for work, I went back to the golf course. I felt more embolden in the daylight. The sky was a bright shade of blue, barely a cloud in the sky as the sun shined brilliantly. I rode up to the burned country house when I saw it laying on the ground. Jason’s collar was broken in half and completely chewed up, Jason himself was no where to be seen. I never knew whether or not if Jason survived that night but I knew that, either way, I wouldn’t be seeing him again. When I came to the other side I saw my helmet laying where I dropped it. When I picked it up I saw something white next to it. It was a huge canine tooth along with a few human teeth.
