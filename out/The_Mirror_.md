Evelyn had always been a cautious person. She locked her doors before bedtime, checked the windows at night to make sure they were secure, and kept a watchful eye on any strange sounds coming from outside. But what terrified her most—what kept her awake at night, her heart racing, and her breath shallow—was the mirror in her hallway.

It wasn’t anything particularly special, just an antique with a wooden frame, gilded in a faded gold that looked more dusty than shining. It had belonged to her grandmother, who, when she passed, left the mirror to Evelyn as one of her few possessions. At first, Evelyn had hung it up out of obligation—a reminder of the woman who had raised her when her parents couldn’t. But from the moment she placed it in the hallway, she began to feel uneasy, as though the mirror itself had some strange power over her.

It started with small things. Evelyn would pass the mirror and feel an odd, inexplicable shiver crawl up her spine, a sensation like someone had walked over her grave. At first, she dismissed it. Perhaps it was just the cold draft from the hallway window or the flicker of the overhead light. But over time, the sensations grew stronger. There were moments, late at night, when she would catch a glimpse of her reflection and swear it moved differently than she did—like a shadow of herself, just a heartbeat too slow, a step behind.

She told herself she was imagining things. After all, mirrors were just glass and silver—nothing more. But one night, as she passed the hallway again, she saw something that stopped her in her tracks.

The reflection in the mirror wasn’t hers. Not entirely. At first, it looked like her, but her eyes—her eyes were wrong. They were too wide, too dark, like pools of ink that seemed to swirl and shift in unnatural patterns. Evelyn’s breath caught in her throat, and she stepped back, staring at the reflection, her pulse racing. The image remained still, but she could feel the air around her grow colder, as though the very space around the mirror had thickened, become dense with something… waiting.

She turned away quickly, rushing to her bedroom and locking the door behind her. That night, she lay in bed with the covers pulled up to her chin, staring at the ceiling, unable to shake the image of the mirror from her mind.

The next day, she decided to confront the mirror. Perhaps she was just tired, stressed from work, or overthinking things. But when she stood before it again, she felt that familiar unease crawl across her skin. This time, she didn’t look away. She studied her reflection—her own eyes, her features, the way the light played off her hair—and tried to reassure herself that it was just a mirror, nothing more. But as she looked closer, she could see something in the depths of her reflection—a movement, something behind her.

She whipped around, heart pounding. Nothing. The hallway was empty, the light casting long shadows on the floor. She felt her chest tighten, her throat dry. When she looked back at the mirror, the reflection was the same: calm, still, and… normal. But her reflection was smiling at her.

Evelyn stumbled backward, her breath coming in sharp gasps. That wasn’t her smile. The lips that curled upwards in the mirror weren’t the ones she knew. The expression was something darker, something sinister, as though her reflection were mocking her. The smile didn’t reach her eyes.

Her mind raced. It was just a trick of the light. That was all. She had to be imagining it. But the sense of something lurking behind her reflection stayed with her, gnawing at her. She couldn’t shake the feeling that the mirror was alive, that it was watching her, studying her with an unsettling intelligence.

Days passed, but the unease only grew. Evelyn began to avoid the hallway altogether. She found herself making detours around the house just to avoid walking past the mirror. When she had guests over, she would close the door to the hallway, not wanting anyone to see her strange behavior. But still, the mirror called to her, a silent presence in the back of her mind. It was as if it knew her deepest fears, knew how to make her doubt her own sanity.

One evening, unable to bear it any longer, Evelyn decided to confront the mirror once and for all. She was exhausted from the sleepless nights, the constant feeling of being watched. She needed to know what was happening.

She grabbed a flashlight and approached the mirror, her hand trembling as she reached out to touch the glass. The coldness of it shocked her, and for a moment, she hesitated. But then, with a deep breath, she pressed her palm flat against the surface.

The air in the hallway grew thick, almost suffocating, and Evelyn felt a strange pulling sensation, like the mirror was drawing her in. The lights flickered above her, casting shadows that seemed to twist and stretch unnaturally. Her reflection in the glass wavered, distorting as if it were made of liquid rather than solid glass. Her own image looked back at her, but it wasn’t quite right.

And then, her reflection moved.

It tilted its head, just slightly, as if acknowledging her presence. It grinned, an unsettling, wide smile that stretched too far across its face, exposing teeth that were too sharp, too elongated.

Evelyn recoiled, her heart pounding in her chest. “What… what are you?” she whispered, her voice shaking.

The reflection didn’t answer. Instead, it stepped forward, its movements slow, deliberate. Evelyn tried to pull her hand away from the glass, but it wouldn’t budge. She felt a sharp, cold sensation—like a thousand tiny needles pricking her palm—and the reflection’s eyes burned into hers, deep and black, pulling her in.

The world around her seemed to spin. She stumbled backward, but the reflection in the mirror didn’t move. It stayed where it was, smiling, watching her.

Evelyn’s breath came in frantic gasps as she backed away, stumbling towards the door. But before she could reach it, the air grew heavy, thick with a pressure she couldn’t escape. The light flickered one last time, and when it came back on, she was no longer standing in the hallway.

She was inside the mirror.

It was cold and dark, the world around her a twisted version of the hallway she knew so well. The walls were warped, distorted, as if they had been stretched and pulled out of shape. She could hear something moving in the distance, a low whispering, but when she turned to look, there was nothing there.

And then, from behind her, she heard the sound of footsteps.

Slow. Deliberate. Approaching her from the shadows.

Evelyn turned around, her heart pounding, only to find herself staring into the cold, black eyes of her own reflection.

The one that wasn’t her.

The one that had been waiting.
