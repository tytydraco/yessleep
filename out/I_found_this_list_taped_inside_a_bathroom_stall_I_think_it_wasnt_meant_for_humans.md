I wasn’t sure where to post this, but r/nosleep seemed right.

Last night I stopped at a gas station bathroom off the highway. One of the stalls was clogged and out of order, so I used the one next to it. While I was sitting there, I noticed a folded piece of paper taped behind the toilet paper dispenser.

At first I thought it was a prank.

I didn’t finish reading it.  


**"If you found this list, it means you died in a bathroom.**

Now, try following these rules and you will be okay. This is the only assistance you will get from now on.

1. Feed.

You need to feed yourself to stay strong, to keep yourself in existence. Other creatures follow this rule too. You can eat other creatures now, what we call the prey: humans who enter this bathroom.

Feed on loners. They are the easiest prey. You can try feeding on more than one, but it is harder. It is better to leave no one alive who can warn other prey. Warnings make hunting more difficult.

2. Don’t take too much.

Hunt only what is necessary. If you take too much, the prey will avoid this place. You don’t want that.

3. Don’t reveal yourself.

Use the element of surprise. Build the fear from the inside. If you paralyze your prey with terror, they are easier to take.

4.a The janitors know we are here. Don’t take them. They believe we are just a story. Keep it that way.

4.b The stalls are cleaned at night. Keep it that way until morning. Then clog a couple of them so the humans will avoid them. This allows you to control which stalls they use. You can use the toilet paper from the stalls you plan to hunt in to block them.

4.c Once they are inside, wait a minute. When you see them comfortably seated, you may begin the hunt.

4.d Start small. Make noises. Give them time to believe their mind is playing tricks on them. Their heart rate will rise if you did this step correctly. Then you can move to the next one.

4.e. Use the lights in your favor. A slight flicker will make their stomach turn, but they will continue thinking it is “normal.” Space the flickers so the fight-or-flight response doesn’t activate—usually 15 to 20 seconds apart. It depends on the human. With practice, you will learn.

4.f. Make a noise outside the stall, close enough to the door so their mind tells them that leaving is dangerous. They will wait for the sound to fade or “pass.” You can lock the exit door at this point.

4.g Let them see your shadow on the other side of the stall door, just for a moment. Then turn off the lights and position yourself above them, near the ceiling. Turn the lights back on. Do not make a sound.

4.h. Make a small sound. A growl. A laugh. A whisper. When they turn and see you, fear will take over. Terror will paralyze them. You must be fast. JUST BITE.

4.i Take them to your lair through the space above the ceiling. Enjoy your meal.

5. Clean your “plate.”

Leave no trace of the hunt. Traces attract unwanted attention from humans or other creatures.

6. You are not alone.

Other creatures roam this building. They have rules too. If you find yourself in the dark, pay attention. Remember: they have to eat as well."  


I’m posting this because something isn’t sitting right with me.

The lights flickered twice while I was reading section 4.e.

I heard footsteps outside my stall during 4.f.

When I got to 4.g, I realized my shadow wasn’t the only one on the door.

I didn’t finish the list.

I ran.

The stall I was in is now clogged. The one next to it is clean.

There was no paper taped to the wall when I went back with the clerk.

If you find this list in a bathroom, don’t read it inside.

And if the lights flicker—

It already knows you’re there.
