Hello, everyone. Do you believe in supernatural forces? Personally, I believe in them because of an experience that still haunts me. As an Asian, I think many Asians share this belief. Let me continue the story from there, on October 5, 2003, when I was in college in a city (I'd rather not disclose). Our university was quite old, and the surroundings were worn down as it hadn't been renovated for a long time. On that day, my friend M suggested celebrating their birthday at a grill restaurant near the university. As we were all in the dorms, the five of us walked there. We had a good time eating, drinking, and sharing stories until midnight.

M then proposed playing a daring game and mentioned a secluded area of the university with rumors of a girl who had committed suicide due to a love affair. Some claimed to hear cries from that area, and others reported seeing a figure moving in the hallways at night. Despite my initial reservations, I agreed to join the game. We gathered outside the entrance, but the main door was tightly secured with steel wires, so we had to find an alternative route. B suggested climbing over the fence, and after successfully entering, we roamed the outside areas with laughter and jokes.

However, as we progressed, my unease returned. The sealed classroom doors, covered with crossed charms, hinted at something more sinister. Despite my attempts to convince everyone to turn back, M insisted on exploring further. Reluctantly, I followed. Inside, the atmosphere was eerie, with the smell of dampness and decay, sending shivers down my spine. As we explored, T went missing. Panic set in as we searched for him, calling out his name with no response.

Eventually, we decided to venture deeper into the area. Moving from section A to B, we discovered a gymnasium. There, we found T standing on the corner of the bleachers, facing away from us. Rushing towards him, M scolded him for causing worry, but T remained silent, only turning away and walking off. Despite our efforts to follow, T's pace was unnaturally fast. We pursued him until section C, where he suddenly collapsed. Despite our attempts to revive him, he remained unconscious.

After a while, T woke up, looking at us with a bewildered expression. Something seemed to have controlled him. But the story didn't stop there; things took a turn for the worse after T regained consciousness. We heard laughter and cries coming from section C, the area where the girl had supposedly taken her own life. Anxious, we tried to escape from this isolated area, but no matter how we ran, we kept returning to the same spot. I told everyone, "I think we've offended something, and it's making her angry." Seemingly realizing something, H said, "Right, it's the altar. We didn't ask for permission and offer respect before coming in; it's like entering a stranger's house without permission." Following H's advice, we traced our way back to section H.

On the way, we passed through various rooms and collected old newspapers detailing the girl's suicide. Inside the principal's office, we found a paper clearly documenting the date and time of those who came to the school on the day the girl died. As more details unfolded, T discovered another set of documents revealing a substantial amount of money received by the school from the parents of someone. Building on the clues we had gathered earlier, we began to piece together a puzzle. The girl's boyfriend was a wealthy young man, and it appeared there was something hidden about her death.

The vengeful spirit became increasingly aggressive, overturning everything inside the classrooms. It wasn't just a mere ghost; what we faced was a demonic entity filled with unresolved resentment, with no clear solution in sight. This entity possessed B, leading to bizarre behavior, laughter, screams, and violent attempts to attack us. Fortunately, we encountered the security guard. Upon hearing B's screams, the security guard likely entered and found us. Revealing the truth, the security guard explained that 20 years ago, on his first day at the school, L, an outstanding girl and the school's beauty queen, was murdered by her wealthy boyfriend.

Four of us, including myself and the security guard, went to find B. We searched the buildings and discovered B hiding in a research room, crying. The security guard approached him, and B, in a possessed state, bit the security guard's hand and fled. T and I stayed with the security guard, while M chased after B. Pursuing him to the rooftop, M pleaded, "We know we made a mistake by coming here, but we haven't harmed you. Please forgive us, and we promise not to disturb you again." However, when the demon possessed someone, it wasn't easy for them to let go. She laughed and spoke in a disturbing tone, audible enough for us to understand her words.

I grabbed the offerings the security guard had provided earlier, rushed toward B, pinned him to the ground, and placed the offerings on his forehead. B screamed in agony, and I shouted, "LEAVE NOW!" Afterward, everything returned to normal. I carried B on my back, and we went back. Together with the security guard, we placed charms around the areas and hung offerings in front of the girl's altar. It was the first time I saw her face in a photo, and indeed, she was as beautiful as the security guard described. We left that area and never returned, hoping no one else would venture there. A few months later, B succumbed to a severe illness that couldn't be cured, and T, mentally affected, sought psychiatric help but also passed away not long after. Only M, H, and I remained healthy.

Perhaps someday, something will come to me; I just don't know when. Thank you for reading.
