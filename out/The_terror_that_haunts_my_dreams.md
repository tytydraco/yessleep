Late to the show, but last December a little before Christmas my friend and I were driving home after our final exam. There's a red light at a major intersection up ahead and I begin to slow down. I came to a complete stop in the right/sidewalk lane of a four-lane street (two each direction), facing southbound with six cars in front of me and I'm stopped with a sidestreet to my right. Suddenly I hear tires screeching and a crash. I got hit rear-right of my car by another driver. 

We get out, exchange information and begin to take pictures of our respective vehicles. I look up the street to make sure I have a few hundred meters between myself and any vehicles approaching from the north before I step into the left southbound lane so I can get a picture showing the angle of both of our cars and the street signs which are rear-right/northwest intersection of the side street. My friend calls me over to unlock the trunk so he can get paper from his pack to write down his witness statement, and just as I step back into the right lane my car occupies, a northbound driver who was so occupied with observing our collision drifts into the left southbound lane which I just stood in and missed me by about a foot. He was traveling probably about 70km/h (that's ~43mph).

Two days later I go paintballing with aforementioned friend and a few others. In between games you go into the lobby with your mask off and everyone is supposed to put their paintball marker (gun) on safe and have a barrel cover over the muzzle. I'm leaning against a wall in the lobby when previous friend asks if he can borrow money to buy more paint. My back is still leaning against the wall but I lean to the right to hand him my wallet. As I put it in his hand I hear a loud splat against the wall I'm on. I look to find a paintball fired at where my head/eyes should have been had I not moved. Somehow one of the kids across the room was putting his marker down on a table and the barrel cover's retention bungee snapped (allowing the cover to fall off), the safety broke and the marker fired a round. A paintball to the eye at 250fps could have been a game changer, to say the least.

Two days later, I'm out drinking with the friends I went paintball with and some others. We're walking down a major street and I'm naturally a fast walker, so every 25 meters I'm stopping, turning back and waiting for everyone to catch up. At one point, I look back and see everyone is still pretty far back, but it's cold and we're practically at our destination, so instead of stopping to wait I decide to just keep walking ahead. Then for some reason I decide to stop and shout back to them I'll meet them inside. Just as I do so, I hear a loud engine roaring up the street and turn to see a speeding Porsche 10m in front of me hit the west wall of a building literally at a right-angle so hard that more than half of his engine compartment caved in, his air bags deployed and the windows all shattered. Had I kept walking without saying anything to my friends, I probably would have been between the car and the building.

Two days later it's Boxing Day morning. I was in and out a few times throughout the night because I was excited to go pick up some items with my friend (the same one from the collision/paintball/night out). At one point through the night I have a nightmare of the sorts. The earliest part of the dream I can remember is me leaping out of a panel-door van with a rope in my hand. I have no idea why but in the dream my mind knows that someone is trying to kill me. As my feet hit the ground I find myself in my driveway. I run inside the house and for some reason tie the rope to the front door's doorknob, knowing that on the other end of the rope is the killer tied to it. I lock and barricade all of the doors and windows to the house and call 911. The operator tells me every officer is busy with something and no one can come help me. I hang up the phone and am about to call the someone else when I notice the rope has been cut. Trying to stay silent and listen for the killer I suddenly notice everything that can possibly make sound in the house is givin' 'er - kettle, stove fan, toilet, shower, TV, radio, everything! I look up at the stop of the stairs and see someone's foot hit the first step and start walking downstairs. I wake up screaming and sweating, and the first words out of my mouth before I can even think to process it as a dream are: Slender Man.
