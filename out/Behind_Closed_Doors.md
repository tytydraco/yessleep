So, I have a choice to make here. I can either go upstairs, give in to my fear and let my paranoia consume me, or stay strong because this is the real world. The *real* world.  I have to admit, I'm almost at the point of going up there. Almost. If for no other reason than to be sure. You be the judge. 

I'll explain, just how it happened. Stick with me. Let me know what you'd do.

‘Goodnight, munchkin,’ I whispered, taking a risk and kissing Emma’s forehead. I knew that in a few years, maybe even sooner, my little girl wouldn’t want her mum to tuck her in anymore. She wouldn’t want kisses. Wouldn’t want stories. Before long, she wouldn’t even want to let me in the room. If she was going to be anything like me as a teenager, then access to Emma’s room, like access to her life, would be strictly controlled.

  
But for now she's five. And getting her to sleep is hard, especially when the sun was still stubbornly shining outside. I hate the sun sometimes. Mostly around the time I hear the words ‘but Daddy, it’s still daytime!’

  
I guess parenthood does strange things to your mind, especially when you’re a working Dad with a wife on night-shift and the joys of bedtime are all yours. Every. Day.

  
My heart sank as Emma squirmed and opened those eyes that moments before had seemed safely closed. At the sight of those pretty blues, peering out from a smiling face framed by blonde hair, I managed to smile back despite the nagging disappointment and the inward groan at the thought of yet more child-talk when all I really wanted was to flake out on the sofa with a bottle – no – a crate of beer and some kind of violent, mindless, X-rated action film.

  
‘Night Daddy,’ the little girl said sleepily, and I dared to hope she might drift off again for a moment. But the look in those pretty eyes changed suddenly and Emma sat up in bed, looking towards the wardrobe door.

  
‘The door, Daddy,’ she said, a tremor of fear in her voice. I gave the wardrobe a cursory glance, the promise of a relaxing evening rapidly crumbling around me. ‘It’s closed honey,’ I said, trying to keep up the gentle, reassuring bed-time tone.

  
‘It needs to be open.’

  
I blinked, wondering if I’d misheard. Since when did children want doors kept open? Wasn’t the idea to keep the monsters out?

  
‘Why honey?’

  
‘So the fingers can’t come underneath.’

  
This was a new one on me, and having accepted that my evening duty was not yet over, I decided to find out more.

  
‘Fingers, honey? What fingers?’

  
‘Under the door. They reach like this –’ Emma held up her little hands and wiggled her fingers – ‘and they get closer and closer every night. But they don’t come when the door’s open.’

  
Something about this was disturbing even to me. Kids had imaginations, sure, but there was something unusually creepy about the idea of fingers reaching under a door. Something a lot creepier than the usual monsters under the bed and darker than any nightmare I myself had ever had.

  
‘They reach closer each night?’ I asked, against my better judgment. It wouldn’t be a good idea to let these thoughts get any clearer in Emma’s head. My little girl nodded solemnly, her eyes steady and wide. There was no mischief or twinkle of imagination in those blue orbs. She was clearly quite scared of this horrible idea she’d had; I made a mental note to investigate any of Emma’s books and cartoons for anything resembling a creepy door or a long-fingered animal or creature. Such an offender would be made to quietly disappear.

  
‘Last night they reached my bed,’ she said quietly, imploringly, staring at me. In my mind, though I tried to quash the image, I saw long, thin, pale fingers tipped with black nails stretching all the way from the wardrobe to the edges of the duvet, wriggling and reaching with desperate hunger…  
I shuddered. I’d be lucky if I didn’t have nightmares after this.

  
‘Maybe we could put something next to the wardrobe so they can’t get out?’ I said, trying to be practical about it. I knew there was no point insisting that the fingers didn’t exist because my apparently deeply disturbed child clearly believed they did and would continue to do so no matter what I said. Doing something so they weren’t a problem anymore would make more sense to Emma, and might convince her she was safe.

  
Emma shook her head, her golden locks tumbling around her little face. ‘They’re shadow fingers. They go over everything.’

  
Ok so they were shadow fingers. What stops shadows? Light. A small price to pay for a peaceful evening.

  
‘We could leave the light on?’ I suggested, forcing more light and cheer into my tone than I felt. I was still pretty disturbed by my child’s apparent horror-movie of a mind.

  
‘I can’t sleep if the light’s on, Daddy,’ Emma said in that serious, don’t-be-so-silly tone young children sometimes use to the delight of adults, who usually find it adorable when it *isn’t* bedtime.  
I sighed.

  
‘Ok honey let’s open the door.’

  
Standing up, I navigated past the scattered toys and colouring books, ignoring the snap and crunch of unseen pencils under my feet. I’d clean it later, I told myself cynically knowing full well I wouldn’t have the time.

  
The wardrobe door, covered as it was in stickers of pigs and princesses, made a sticky crinkling sound as it opened. I shoved a toy monkey who happened to be by my foot into position to hold it open. The monkey didn’t object, though he fell forward on his face as though mortified at getting door-duty. I spared him a half-smile.

  
Too bad kiddo, tonight isn’t going how either of us planned.

  
I turned to smile broadly at Emma, realising just how tired I was. Emma was watching me carefully, and nodded when she saw the door wouldn’t close.

  
‘Goodnight honey,’ I said, making for the bedroom door and the promise of escape.

  
‘Daddy wait!’

  
‘What?’

  
‘The other doors.’ Emma was staring, wide-eyed at me. She looked terrified. I glanced around the room, wondering what other doors she could possibly mean –

  
Then it hit me. Doors on the piggy bank. Doors on the Wendy house. Doors on the toy oven.

  
Doors *everywhere*.

  
‘Emma, now come on,’ I said, allowing a note of no-nonsense to creep into my voice, ‘you said the fingers come from the wardrobe –’

  
Emma flinched at the mention of the fingers, and I gave myself a mental kick. Crossing the room to the little girl, I wrapped her in a hug and whispered soothingly to her. Emma was crying softly. After a few minutes, I let her go and brushed the hair out of Emma’s eyes.

  
‘Is it all the doors, baby?’ I asked softly, resigned to the fact that I would have to patrol the whole room and open every door that could be opened. Emma sniffed and nodded, holding her duvet up to her nose.

  
And so, one by one, I walked the room opening all the doors I could find. Barbie’s house. The little toy car. The plastic tree in which lived Mr Owl behind what I supposed might pass as a door. Finally, I thought I must have gotten them all. I stood back, placing the tiny fire-engine with all its open doors on the table. I surveyed my work, strangely pleased with myself. It had actually been an interesting exercise; who knew how many doors there were in a single room? Perhaps it would have a deep and meaningful philosophical explanation, but if it did I honestly didn’t care. Right now, there was to be beer in a glass and explosions on TV. A reward for good work.

  
‘You think we got them all honey?’

  
Emma nodded happily from the bed, and flopped down onto her pillows. She pulled the duvet up to her neck and smiled adorably. I gave her a kiss and watched those pretty eyes close. Within moments, she was asleep.

  
Carefully, quietly, I made my way out of the room and headed downstairs.

  
It wasn’t until I’d cracked open my first beverage of the evening and settled on the sofa, remote in hand, that it occurred to me that I’d closed Emma’s bedroom door. It was an automatic thing; I always closed the door. Sound carries in our house and I didn’t want to disturb the child’s sleep. Besides, Mel would be home soon and I needed to know we could talk without being overheard.

  
And yet, the thought of those fingers. Where on earth had that horrible idea come from? I was half-tempted to go upstairs and check on Emma, but that was a ridiculous overreaction surely?

  
Taking a slurp of the beer, I placed the glass on the coffee table and clicked the TV on with the remote. The picture swam into life. I started hunting through the old blu-rays we still haven't gotten rid of, as a news report played behind me on the TV.

  
‘…bringing the total number missing to four in just two weeks,’ a female journalist was saying. ‘Police say there is nothing material to connect the incidents, but the ages of the victims and the peculiar timing leads this reporter to conclude there might be more to this than we have yet seen.’

  
I ignored the news, idly picking out something featuring an absurdly muscle-bound man holding a laughably enormous gun. One of Mel's. She doesn't care for the stories but she does love a grim hero. I flipped it over to read the back. Behind me, the news continued. A man’s voice, presumably in the newsroom, was talking to the reporter.

  
‘Do we know anything about the kidnappers yet Maya, have there been any demands?’

  
‘Tom, all we know is that the girls were taken from their beds in the middle of the night, and that entry doesn’t seem to have been forced. There were no smashed windows, no broken doors –’

  
At the word ‘doors’, I froze.

  
‘– and nothing to explain the fact that these children have simply vanished. If there is a connection, and if there are kidnappers out there, then so far they have made no effort to contact the authorities with any ransom demands. I spoke with Mrs Traves earlier today, whose daughter Mildred was gone from her bed this morning.’

  
I watched with dawning horror as the image switched to a distraught looking woman in her early thirties, sobbing and shaking as she explained how her daughter had disappeared.

  
‘She was just gone!’ the woman wailed, ‘There was no sign of her. I thought maybe she’d gotten out of the house, but then I saw her dolly in the wardrobe. She doesn’t go anywhere without her dolly –’ the woman collapsed into hysterical tears as ice closed over my heart.

  
In the wardrobe. The dolly was in the *wardrobe*.

  
Reason warred with panic as I half rose to my feet, then sat back again, staring in disbelief at the TV. Emma had been talking about nightmares, that’s all. A stupid, childish fantasy created from half understood sights and sounds from the world around her. These kids on the news…that was something else. Something real. And yet…girls. Taken from their beds. 

  
And nothing left of that child on the news except her dolly, found where it shouldn’t have been. Where the girl would not have left it. Where long, shadowy fingers had dragged her from her bed…

  
I launched to my feet and lurched in the direction of the door, knocking over the glass in my sudden instinctive terror. The TV remote flew from my hand and cracked against the wall; I barely noticed it as I pounded up the stairs towards the closed door of Emma’s room.

  
I managed to catch myself before I started shouting, hesitating there on the other side of the door. My fingers lightly brushed the handle, as if with a mind of their own.

&#x200B;

I told myself I was being stupid. Told myself to write this before I did anything else. A way to get my thoughts straight. But it hasn't helped.

  
I'm going back up there. As for you, if you have kids, turn on the [news.](http://sdjackson.blogspot.com/2022/04/my-stuff-publications-and-stories.html)
