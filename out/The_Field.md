Even when my silver tongue pleads to the stars, silence would meet my words with with a cold blow of the wind. A field of sharp thistle gripped my ankles and pulled my skin. The painful rebirth of their bed demanded my attention, yet my eyes only saw the black skies. I had nothing but hope for my success, and without it, I would never bound myself to this mortal realm. 

Why wasn't He answering me? I did everything right. I lived my entire life for this moment, and all He has to say is nothing? What more could He want beyond my undying devotion? As thorns drained my blood and claimed my flesh, my head only faced the vast, empty sky. Up my legs and around my waist, Earth anchored my body to her. 

My faith wavered only slightly before He finally showed me His power. My eyes rolled back into my head, turning my vision into a black abyss. Intense euphoria filled my body as His presence stroked my heart. 

"See? Like I said." A low voice hissed in my skull. "No more pain. I am good. I am the way."

He's real. He's really really real. I just heard Him, and my feeling was undeniably good. I knew in every fiber of my soul that benevolence was now guiding my life, and I couldn't be happier. Vines held my mouth open and fed themselves down my throat. The sky was so pretty as they filled my lungs. 

"Surrender yourself to me."

I gurggled joyacly as saliva ran down my cheeks. He assured me I was chosen, and there was nothing to be afraid of now. I didn't fight the plants invading my eye sockets and plugging my ears. I no longer needed to see or hear anything besides Him. He may feast on my eyes and cease my senses.

With a sharp breath, I woke up in a hospital. A man in a white coat was explaining something to a group of interns. What was I doing here? Where were the stars? Where was He? The voices stopped for a moment to observe my wired body. I froze to avoid detection. 

Silence rolled over the room as it cleared out. This was my moment. I ripped the tube out of my throat. Needles attached to infusion pumps squirted liquid wildly once removed frome my veins. Machines screamed as I took patches of hair out with the ECG wires attached to my skin. As soon as I was freed, several people swarmed the room to see what was happening. 

Glass shattered and rained onto the green grass as I struck the ground outside the hospital. Screaming doctors and nurses served as a good soundtrack to my escape. On my feet, I ran as fast as I could into the nearby woods. No one followed, yet I sprinted until I was back to the field beneath the stars.

My gown was tossed to the dirt as my naked body laid back down in the field of Him. 

Take my blood. Take my flesh. Take me home. My eyes rolled back, and He spoke again.
