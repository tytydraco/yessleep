I never thought I'd come back here, but something else has happened.  

For those of you that don't know, I made a post about a spirit that has essentially been haunting me for, at this point, four weeks. If you want to go ahead and read that first, maybe catch up a little, I went ahead and put a link to it at the top of this post. But for those of you that already know, I guess we can just go ahead and get started.  

I didn’t expect that first post to get that much attention. Honestly, I thought people would just think I had gone insane. But that didn’t seem to be the case, and I even got a comment. I want to say thank you in advance for wishing me safety and address something that was asked.  

*If it wanted to kill you or your kitty, it could have, so what* ***does*** *it want?*  

I mulled over the question for days, gathering evidence along the way. I recorded every sound that beast made when it was trying to attack or just moving around the house. I wrote down every odd thing I noticed, every detail in the differences between it and Hades meows. I scribbled down pictures of what it looked like, of each form it would take. I even managed to capture a video of it lingering outside my bedroom door but when I tried to watch it my phone completely crashed and I had to buy a new one.  

I think it figured out what I was doing.  

The usual nighttime visit would happen at least four to five times between ten at night and three in the morning. But as the days passed it dwindled down to a mere two. Soon it was just an occasional sniff at the bottom of the door before it lost complete interest. I didn’t even see it in the morning anymore. The usual glimpses I would get were pointless because each time; it wasn’t there. I didn’t like that. I didn’t like that it had spent days tormenting me only to hide when I started to retaliate.  

I became upset; desperate.  

I started roaming the house at night.  

Every night at one I would leave my room and walk around the house with nothing but the light of my phone to guide the way. I didn’t do much, mainly just stood around or rummaged through the cupboards when I was hungry. For five days I did this, turning my back on every strange noise or turning off my phone to be plunged into complete darkness. Anything to draw it out.  

And yet, there was nothing.  

I knew it hadn't complete disappeared because that familiar feeling still stuck to my skin like honey. The feeling that I was being watched. It was still there, still standing, still watching. But not advancing. It was merely… waiting. But for what?  

It was 1:30 and like the past few days, I was standing in the middle of the dark kitchen. My phone was pointing to the left, illuminating Hades' water bowl as he drank from it. I attempted to lower the device but as soon as the darkness began to touch the tips of his ears I was met with quite the ferocious glare.  

"You're a cat, dumbass. You can see in the dark." I huffed, eyes rolling as he turned back to the bowl. I lowered the phone despite the annoyed meow I received and looked around the room. The only light besides my phone was the clock on the microwave that I was convinced was there to mock me. Hours of sleep missed over something that I was starting to think really *was* just a nightmare.  

At that point I figured it was time to give up, but something in my head was nagging for me to do just one more test. The thought dug a hole into the back of my brain like maggots burrowing into a rotting carcass. I couldn't ignore it. So, I turned off the phone and plunged myself into the darkness.  

I stared into the void that was supposedly the living room, watching each little wisp of change that my eyes managed to pick up. There's something funny about the darkness and how it could enhance the senses. Suddenly my ears were picking up on sounds I never made an effort to notice. A dog barked out from a house up the corner, the cry of an ambulance rang from the distant road followed by maybe two or three police cars.   

My eyes adjusted slowly to the dark environment, and I could start to see the outline of furniture. The couch was big and unconventional like always. The chairs at the dining room table weren’t pushed in all the way. There was a paper bag on the floor just at the corner of the counter, something Hades had been obsessed over ever since we brought it home from the local market.  

But no monster.  

I sighed; shoulders slumped in defeat. There was no point in trying anymore. I don’t even know why I was trying so hard to find it. Did I want to prove that it was real? That I wasn’t crazy? What would I have even done if I did manage to prove its existence? There have been countless claims of monsters throughout human existence, mine would just be written off as another thing. A myth.  

“C’mon Hades let's just... go watch TV or something. I’ll put on some cartoons. I need something relaxing to watch." 

He meowed, stepping away from the bowl to rub against my leg before advancing forward. I trailed behind but didn't get very far because Hades paused at the edge of the kitchen. He stared into the living room, the fur on his back slowly rising as his body arched in a position that looked ready to attack. My eyes widened. In the ten years we've had Hades, I had never seen him like this. 

I acted on instinct, pulling a knife from the shelf before scooping him up with one arm. He didn't fight, curling against my chest as he yowled at the void ahead. I held the knife at the ready, breath hitching as a familiar noise reached my ears. 

*Footsteps.* 

My grip tightened, my breathing slowed, it felt like time had stopped. There was only me and the darkness. 

The light flickered on, and I screeched, waving the knife around like a mad man. 

"Fuck you! Fuck you, you ugly bastard! Stay away from me!" 

"Hey, hey! Calm the fuck down!" 

I froze, finally letting my eyes adjust to the sudden brightness of the kitchen. My gaze flickered towards the light switch where my dad was standing. His arms were hung at his sides; hands balled into fists. His brows were knit together in anger, yet his eyes still looked tired from being woken up. 

"What the hell is wrong with you? It's almost two in the morning and you're skulking around in the dark with a knife. Put it down. Now!' 

I complied, turning to tuck the knife back where I had found it. Hades stayed curled in my arm, eyes directed towards my father. Even when my neck blocked his view, he kept his head in that same direction. I knew Hades didn't have much of a fondness for him, but the looked in his eyes was odd. Like he was looking at a complete stranger. 

"Sorry, dad." I mumbled, feeling embarrassed for having been found such a way. "I was just trying to-" 

"I swear to god if you bring up that damn thing *again*, I'll do more than just yell." 

Whatever response I had tried to come up with deflated on the spot and my body suddenly felt a hundred times heavier. He wouldn't have listened to any kind of excuse anyway. I don't know why I even bothered to try. 

He watched as I rushed past and down the hall to my bedroom where I could hear him yell just one more time before shutting the door, 

"You're lucky you didn't wake up your mother. And if I catch you doing this again, I won't be as nice!" 

Yeah, I stopped after that. I didn't want to find out what my dad would do if he found me in the dark again. Luckily mom was on my side. She scolded my father for scaring me and even tried to suggest that I might have been sleepwalking (Which I have never done). He didn't really like that argument but eventually backed down. 

I didn't get off with just a warning though. He started making me do yard work as a punishment. Chopping up wood, mowing the lawn, raking up leaves. It sucked. The only housework I want to do is the video game kind; at least then I get some kind of money for my work, even if it is digital. I didn't complain though, I couldn't. In my dad's mind the only pain that mattered was his own. It didn't matter if it was mental or physical, if you complained you were ungrateful for all he'd done and needed to shut the fuck up. 

He'd always been a piece of shit. I'm surprised my mother even stays with him. If it was my choice, we would've both been gone years ago. Maybe life would actually be good. 

But his shitty personality is the very reason I knew something was wrong. One day he just started being nicer. He made me breakfast; a full breakfast. Eggs, bacon, homemade cinnamon waffles. I remember checking the calendar that day to see if it was a special occasion, but it wasn't. It was just the 26th, just a Saturday. The starting point to the worst five days of my life. 

On the 27th he made pancakes that seemed to be buried under a mountain of whipped cream and blueberries. He gave my mom a rather long and gross kiss before leaving to get the grocery shopping done early. As soon as the front door shut, I turned to her. 

"Mama?" I slid the berries and cream off my pancakes. "Does dad seem… weird to you?" 

"What do you mean, baby?" 

I paused. How do you even go about this kind of topic? 

"He just seems off lately. Happier, I guess? Did we win the lottery or something?" 

"Not that I know of. Why do you ask? Don't you like being pampered?" she chuckled into her mug of coffee. 

"It's just strange. He's never been, you know, that nice. You don't even like being around him sometimes. I mean how could you?" It was a bad attempt at humor, something to lighten the mood and maybe get her to open up more. But instead of laughter, I was met with a death glare. 

"Your father is doing his best for this family. if you don't appreciate it, keep it to yourself." 

"Whoa! Mama I- I didn't mean to be mean or anything it's just-" 

"No! Take your pancakes and go eat in your room. Go!" 

I'm man enough to admit that I almost cried right there at the table. My mother yelled on very few occasions and even if she did it was never directed towards me. Nineteen years and this is the first time I'd ever been shouted at. It was honestly frightening. For the first time in my life, I felt frightened of my mother. 

I didn't even bother with breakfast; I had no appetite anymore. I just stood from the table and ran off to my bedroom where, now that I was alone, I did cry. Not necessarily because of the shouting, even though it did play a part. 

No, I cried because of the way she looked at me as I left the table. Like I was a burden. Like she hated me; truly and deeply. That wasn't my mother, it couldn't have been. That thing did something to her. 

It did something to them both. 

As the days passed, they got worse. My mother became more angry, more violent. I had accumulated at least seven different punishments in the span of two days. Some were justified; I had started roaming the house at night again due to paranoia. Others were for small things, like when I complained about the heat even though she had done the same not even five seconds before. 

My father started requesting more time together. He taught me how to bake bread and cooked my favorite meals. He even took me out to the art museum, something I had been wanting to visit since we first moved here. It was a wonderful time, and he even stopped at a few places to get fro-yo and a brand-new game console. He hadn't bought me a proper gift in over a decade. Lord forgive me but whatever that thing did to my father might've just been a blessing. 

He was the complete opposite of his former self, they both were. It was almost like they switched personalities and then multiplied their habits by hundreds. 

All good things don't last though, because today was the day it all crumbled. 

I had been in the bathroom brushing my teeth when I heard it; the shouting. My mother. I had slowly gotten used to it over the past three days, though I couldn't help but flinch when I heard her smash a plate against the floor which was followed by the sound of my father's please for her to calm down. 

I leaned over the sink to spit up the mixture of toothpaste and saliva in my mouth when my ears decided to block out every sound but one. A thump. Something had been hit. I froze. Had my mother become deranged enough to put her hands on my father? No, surely not. My head turned to the open doorway to yell out, to ask if something was wrong, when I heard something else. 

Hades' cry. 

I bolted to the kitchen where my mother stood in the middle, body shaking with anger, my father was a few steps ahead of her, eyes wide and shaky hands raised in a placating manner. I looked around, heart dropping when I noticed the small lump behind him. 

It was Hades. He was laying on the ground, eyes shut and body limp. His breathing was heavy, but it was still breathing. 

My fists curled. 

"What did you do to him?" 

No response. 

"What the fuck did you do to him?!" 

"She kicked him." 

I looked at my father and he looked back. There were tears in his eyes. 

"He only wanted a treat." 

I choked on a sudden sob, directing a glare in my mother's direction. She just stood there and stared. She didn't care, not one bit. I watched as her lips curled high, higher than what was physically possible. 

She was proud. Proud to have hurt Hades, proud to have frightened my father to the point of tears, proud to see the way I seethed with anger. 

And she was only getting started. 

I remember the way her body contorted. The sounds of bones breaking as limbs twisted and turned in directions they weren't supposed to. Her lower half was backwards now, legs bent and positioned like a spider. Her torso fell against the ground like that part of her had gone limp, arms elongating and claw-like nails digging into the tiled flooring. Her eyes rolled back like they weren't connected to the socket and her upper lip protruded like some kind of duck bill, one long sharp tooth positioned at the front. I can still see the way her jaw hung like it was broken. I can still hear the noise she made, a low groan that bubbled up from her gut. 

I heard my father whimper before Hades was suddenly shoved into my arms. 

*"Run."* 

She bolted forward as soon as that word left his lips, feet pounding against the floor as she used her nails to drag the upper part of her forward. I ran down the hall as she toppled him, listening to the sounds of his screams as I shut and locked the door. 

I laid Hades on the desk before prying the window open and grabbing a pair of scissors. I stabbed into the window screen, twisting the end until a small hole formed just big enough for me to cut out the whole thing. After tossing the scissors aside, I picked up Hades and tucked him underneath my shirt. 

"Baby?" 

Her head hit the door. 

"Come unlock the door for your mama." 

Her claws reached underneath the bottom, scrapping against the hardwood. 

*"Let me in you little bitch!"* 

She slammed her body against the door, making the whole room shake. The house filled with the sounds of her shrieking, claws digging at the floor so hard that the panels started to come up. I heard the creak of the doors hinges and knew I had to hurry. 

So, I dove out the window. 

My body curled protectively around Hades as we rolled down the hill before coming to a complete stop against the road below. I stood slowly, blinking to refocus my gaze, and ran. I ran until it hurt to breath, until my legs were screaming with pain and my throat felt like sandpaper. I ran until were on the opposite end of the neighborhood and outside Miss Beatrice's house. 

My side slammed against the front door at full speed, body sliding downwards to slump on the porch. I watched as the lights flickered on and listened to the sound of her approaching footsteps. My vision darkened just as the door opened. 

I woke up to Hades licking my cheek and about three different policemen standing around me. Apparently, Beatrice had called the police after finding me unconscious and directed them to my home in worry that my parents had been abusing me. Honestly, I wish it were that simple. 

They told me that every light in the house was on when they went to go check it out. My bedroom door had been smashed to bits and the room itself was completely destroyed. The kitchen was a mess, cutlery all over the floor and the glass of the oven door shattered along with it. In front of the dining room table was a puddle of blood where my father had been attacked. A trail of it led to one of the windows which had been completely torn from the wall. There was no body. 

I gave my statement, recounting every detail I could remember. They looked at me like I was crazy, I think they even considered bringing me in. But Beatrice somehow talked them out of it. 

Speaking of, she had offered for me to stay until I was capable of living on my own. She tidied up the guest room as nicely as she could and baked some fresh cookies to help 'bring a little cheer' after what I had been through. 

So now I'm here, eating some cookies and watching a random movie from her collection of VHS tapes. Hades is stretched out against my leg, ears raised and alert for any possible danger. We're going to take him to the vet tomorrow to make sure my mom didn't do any permanent damage to him. 

I don't know if she's still out there or if she even knows where I am. I don't know if she's ever going to come back. 

All I know is that for the first time in four weeks, I'm in a safe place. 

And I'm going to enjoy my time here. 

Even if that feeling still lingers.
