The mere idea of an aquarium in Poprad is a cruel joke. Slovakia has no access to the sea. Poprad is a mountain town of fifty thousand that has zero reason or desire for anything fish related.

The aquarium should not exist, yet it does. I have always been confused by its existence, but when I saw a posting for a night watchman job I didn’t hesitate.

It was in a quiet part of town. Seemed like easy money.

The only expensive thing in the aquarium was its prize attraction, *Jánošík* — the giant octopus. The many limbed creature must have cost a fortune, and transporting it to Central Europe could not have been easy — yet the money spent on *Jánošík* would have not been of any interest to the local hooligans or drug addicts that might try to break in during the night.

*Jánošík* didn’t have a care in the world. He would just float around the central tank of the aquarium, occasionally snacking on one of the squids that were imported for him. All around the mammoth sea creature sat exhibits of freshwater fish native to the area. Carp, catfish, eels, trout — the selection of the other exhibits didn’t differ much from the frozen food isle. If *Jánošík* was an avocado, he was surrounded by a field of potatoes.

The crux of my job was showing up to the aquarium an hour before closing time, ushering what few visitors there were and then patrolling the grounds until the place opened back up in the morning. For months, I was just content picking up a paycheck for hanging out with an octopus, but then one day everything changed.

My boss, Mr. Kuffa, was an alcoholic who long ago gave up on trying to hide the fact. The liquor kept him occupied and he barely spoke to me, yet that particular morning he screamed. He had called me up on the morning of a day off and insisted that I show up at work immediately. Mr. Kuffa had heard I spoke English. I was needed to translate. The owner of the aquarium had shown up.

H. Willow was an American scientist. He had paid for the aquarium to be constructed five years prior and a family friend secured Mr. Kuffa the job of managing it. Aside from bringing in the giant octopus and paying for its exotic live feed, he never interfered with business. That was, until he decided to visit that afternoon.

He had finely trimmed facial hair and wore a strange garb that seemed to be a marriage between a lab coat and a suit. Willow wasn’t alone. With him, he had two enormous men with shaved heads and dull eyes.

Finding Mr. Kuffa half a bottle deep into his workday was an unpleasant surprise for H. Willow. The fact that the drunk manager couldn’t communicate with him proved to be a much bigger inconvenience. Willow did not hide his annoyance. When I entered the room, he was screaming and looked like he was about to slap my boss with his notebook. Luckily, the muscle he had brought along didn’t share his anger. The two giant men just stared off into the ether as their boss ranted and raved.

I had learned most of my English from watching shows and I’ve never had much time to practice, but eventually I managed to start translating. As his points started to get across, Willow calmed. He even managed a laugh or two by the time his orders were delivered.

Mr. Kuffa wasn’t smiling. As I told him what H. Willow wanted, all the drunkenness drained from his eyes and was replaced by fear.

The fish in the exhibits were to be *replaced* over the following weeks. Willow’s men would take care of the entire affair and all they needed was a place to *dispose* of the old fish. Eventually, everything in the aquarium would be replaced. Everything at the aquarium would be *new*.

There were liabilities and laws to consider, but it wasn’t until the question of *Janošík* had been brought up that Mr. Kuffa’s face tipped from confusion to fear.

“Of course we’ll replace him!” Willow exclaimed with sudden force and joy, “Octopuses are a thing of the past! It’s time we made room for new animals!” The man’s speech had shifted from a calm explanation to a sudden burst of energy. Even one of the giants that stood behind Willow seemed to be momentarily brought out of his trance to flinch.

The aquarium potentially losing its only source of visitors might’ve been an unpleasant thought, but it was the realization that he was dealing with a madman that drained the blood from his face. Mr. Kuffa started to stutter out questions that H. Willow had no interest in answering. With a deep breath, the scientist spoke directly to me.

With his voice slowly descending back to calmness, H. Willow explained that the aquarium was to be left empty on the nights of the *replacements*. All security systems were to be shut off to keep things *simple*. None of the signage outside of the exhibits was to be removed. If any of the visitors inquired about any changes to the fish, management was to deny everything. A healthy bonus would be issued for *discretion*.

H. Willow handed me a list of dates scrawled in pencil on children’s stationary. Telling me to explain everything to my boss, the scientist got up and left. For a moment the giants stood by his chair, staring blankly at the wall but, eventually, they left too.

My boss was in complete disbelief about what we were being asked to do, but eventually he took the paper and told me to leave him be. The man I left in that office was filled with despair, but by my next shift Mr. Kuffa seemed in more stable spirits. He was even, uncharacteristically, sober. He informed me that the aquarium would be following Willow’s wishes and that I would get a bonus of 200 euros a month for keeping my mouth shut.

I didn’t ask him how much of the discretion bonus the 200 euros were. I was just happy for the two hundred bucks. When the first *replacement* date came about two weeks later, I enjoyed my night off and didn’t think much of it.

When I first got into the aquarium on the following day, nothing seemed to have changed. The fish looked just about the same, the exhibits remained unaltered and nothing in the aquarium seemed amiss. It wasn’t until the lights dimmed and I started my patrol that I noticed something off.

The school of fish in the minnow exhibit. They still looked like something you could get in a bait shop, but with the lights of the aquarium turned down, I could see that they were glowing. The light emanating from their little bodies was dim and took concentration to see, but it was undeniable. H. Willow had made the minnow’s glow.

The new exhibit consumed most of my attention that first night, but over the following days the appeal of the glowing fish faded. The *changes* that were made to the fish would always be something small. The carp would shoot little bursts of water against the glass. The whiskers of the catfish would move as if they had a life of their own. The eels would swim just a little faster. I’d find it interesting on first sight, but as the changes lost their novelty, I would return back to spending my nights watching *Jánošík* sluggishly swim around his tank.

Sure, I did wonder about what it was that Willow was doing to the fish, but I didn’t worry too much about it. It wasn’t any of my business. The two hundred euros kept my mind at ease. I didn’t worry about H. Willow’s *replacements* until, one night, I found *Jánošík’s* tank filled with darkness.

In his central tank, the giant octopus didn’t have any reason to worry. His home was roomy, filled with plenty of live feed with no predators to fear. I had never seen *Jánošík* ink. After the final *replacement* night, however, the inside of his tank was murky with dark defensive clouds.

*Jánošík* had seemingly changed overnight as well. I could still recognize the same giant octopus, but instead of swimming around at his own pace, he kept on following me as I walked by the tank. What made matters so much stranger was that he wasn’t alone. *Jánošík* was surrounded by the little squids and fish he used to eat.

No emotion could be read from behind his slitted inhuman eyes, but I could tell that the octopus was scared. As were all the other creatures flanking his nervous form. Off in the cloudy dark, I could see something shift.

Fearing that there might be something wrong with the filtration system I gave Mr. Kuffa a call. It took him a while to pick it up, but when he did, he had no interest in hearing about the filtration system. I wasn’t being paid to investigate the safety of the tanks. I was just meant to make sure no junkies break into the aquarium. Within a couple slurred sentences I could hear that he was already drunk. Not wanting to fight a losing battle, I apologized and hung up.

I had hoped that maybe the tank would clear out on the following night, but it didn’t. When I returned back to work, *Jánošík* looked much worse than he did the night before. His large orange body was covered in dark brown bruises and some of the suckers on one of his tentacles seemed to be missing. The crowd of prey that had sheltered around the Octopus had also grown considerably smaller.

There was something else in the tank. It wasn’t a fish or a squid or an octopus. From beyond the smokey ink, I could see its silhouette. It had arms. It had legs. The creature was far too small to be a person, but it was humanoid in nature.

I did my best to not look too closely at *Jánošík* and busied myself with patrolling other parts of the aquarium. With a dull thud, however, the central tank called to me.

It all happened in an instant. From the dark waters came a claw. A monkey-like claw that tried to grasp at the head of the octopus. As *Jánošík* fought off the intruder, the claw switched its target. With hooked talons, the monkey grasped one of the squids that was sheltering by the octopus and fled back into the dark waters.

I called Mr. Kuffa once more. The filtration in the tank being faulty was one thing, but *Jánošík* seemed to be in imminent danger from whatever had been put in his tank. My boss took ages to pick up, and when he did, he was furious that I was interrupting him while he was at home. When I detailed the reason for my interruption, he told me to not patrol the central section of the aquarium anymore. Whatever was happening in the tank was happening with the blessings of H. Willow.

He'd give me four hundred euros at the end of the month if I promised to keep it to myself. Without giving me a chance to respond, Mr. Kuffa hung up on me. When he clicked off his phone, however, the call did not end. For a couple seconds, my phone was still lit up. On the other end of the call, I could hear the phone rustle. It was only after a couple seconds of this rustling that the phone actually went dark.

Someone was listening in on our conversation. Memories of Willow’s towering bodyguards quickly filled my mind. I had spent months in silent friendship with the octopus, yet I retreated to the exhibits in the back of the aquarium. I didn’t want to see *Jánošík* get hurt, but I was much more concerned about my own safety.

Spending time around the glowing minnows or the goofy catfish didn’t calm me. Where months ago, the creatures seemed like innocent curiosities, they were now demented steps towards the violent beast in the main tank.

When I finally left the aquarium at the end of my shift, I considered never returning. I considered calling Mr. Kuffa, telling him a family emergency had come up and that I would not be able to work for at least a month. I even took out my phone to start my retreat.

Yet I never dialed his number. At the moment, I convinced myself it was because the extra money was good and the job was easy and that if I kept to myself everything would be fine. Now, however, I know that was a lie. I didn’t call Mr. Kuffa that morning because I was scared someone else might be listening in on the call.

When I came in on the following shift, Mr. Kuffa had already left the office. Only the grumpy ticket lady remained. When I asked if anyone had complained about *Jánošík* she shrugged. It had been a slow day. If anyone had words for her, she wasn’t listening. When I asked her if she had seen the central tank herself, the ticket lady, proudly, told me that she had no interest in fish and that she hadn’t moved past the ticket office in six months.

I tried to let some of the old woman’s disdain for her job rub off on me. For around thirty minutes I found myself content looking at the strange carp and colorful minnows, but eventually my fondness for *Jánošík* got the better of me.

I entered the main hall. The water was clear. For a moment I was relieved. I thought that maybe Mr. Kuffa had taken my qualms to heart and had the filtration system fixed. Yet quickly, the clearness of the water proved to be a terrible omen. What I saw in the central tank chilled me to my very core.

*Jánošík* was dead. Floating in the middle of his tank, the giant octopus had been robbed of most of his tentacles. The few bits of appendage that remained were bruised and cut with terrible violence. The sight of the familiar animal brutalized made me uneasy, yet it was only a fraction of the terror I was witnessing.

What was worse — what was so much worse — was the sight of the creature that had delivered such violence onto the giant octopus. The beast was shaped like a chimpanzee yet it had the face of a fish. The moss-like fur that covered its body shined with a luminescence of dazzling shifting colors. With its savage claws, the creature ripped at *Jánošík*. With teeth as sharp as knives, the beast ate the octopus’s flesh.

The sheer terror of what I was witnessing made my hands numb. I dropped my flashlight. The monstrosity on the other side of the glass seemed to be in the midst of a manic feeding frenzy, yet the crash made its attention singular.

Slowly, with an eerie gentleness, the creature swam toward me. It’s eyes, a horrid grey mixture of mammal and aquatic life, watched me with curiosity. In its incomprehensible jaw, the thing thoughtfully chewed the dead flesh of my companion.

I wanted to retreat. Desperately, I wanted to dull my brain with glowing fish and boring eels. All I wanted to do was to run away from the horrid amalgamation that stared at me from behind the glass, but I could not.

A chimpanzee with the face of a fish. Glowing all the colors of the rainbow. I was utterly mesmerized. The thing had me in a trance.

Suddenly, the abomination snapped open its massive jaw. I stumbled backward, brought back to reality by the sudden movement. Chunks of *Jánošík’s* flesh hung in the water, like unanswered questions. Then, slowly, they started to descend down into the terrible maw of the fish-thing.

The creature was sucking water. Out of fear, I stumbled a step or two back, yet curiosity kept me still. I wanted to know what the fishmonkey was doing.

In a terrible thud, the answer came. The beast was pushing a stream of water out of its mouth, just like the replaced carp. The carp, however, only tapped the glass. The beast that swam before me that night, sent it crashing down.

The fishmonkey’s neck tore open with massive gills. Like the ventilators of some terrible amphibian machine, the gills sucked in water and strengthened the monstrosity’s stream. A spiderweb of crystal broke out across the wall of the central tank. Before I had a chance to run, the glass wall fractured into a thousand pieces and the world became wet.

The wave of water knocked me off my feet, but I quickly regained my balance. The fishmonkey’s footing was less even. It crawled over the sharp edges of its tank yet managed to move no further. It struggled in the broken glass, it’s gills heaving with punished effort.

The thing looked as if it was about to die, but then, with muscles shivering beneath the fur of moss, the monstrosity started to rise. It took impotent breaths with its fish mouth. With each inhale it wheezed in a pained shrill tone. The creature was struggling, trying to will its biology to perform an act it was not built for, yet with each breath its vocalizations deepened. With each breath, the fish monkey grew stronger.

The moment I was reminded of those terrible teeth, I ran. Behind me, I could hear the beast’s darkening grunts but its footsteps splashed with lack of balance. Their tempo quickly sped up. When I was sure the creature could catch me, I hid in the nearest place I could find — the janitor’s closet.

I stood in the darkness. Shaking. Praying for my soul.

Out in the hallway, the creature’s footfalls splashed. It ran past the door and towards the lobby. I held my breath. I waited for that monstrosity to be completely gone before I moved a muscle.

The moment, I was sure. The moment I could hold my breath no longer, I reached into my pocket and picked up my phone. 

I called Mr. Kuffa.

It was still early in the evening. Mr. Kuffa would be drunk, but he would be awake. I begged the universe to bring him to his phone, yet the dial tone numbed all my hopes. Mr. Kuffa was not picking up the phone. Past the tonal reminder of his absence, I heard something worse.

The wet footsteps had returned. They were heading towards the door.

As dial tone dragged on, I could hear the fishmonkey’s gasps once more. They were of a dark tenor now. They sounded like grunts. Yet, as the creature’s face descended towards the door, its wheezes grew shrill once more.

The creature huffed at the crack of the door. Even though the thing had no nose, it was trying to smell what was inside of the janitor’s closet. I stood as far back as I could. I pressed down on the nearest air refreshener. Yet I could not mask my presence.

The creature’s head retracted and its grunts grew violent again. With a terrible thud, the door shook. The horrid amalgamation of life outside started to roar.

“What seems to be the problem?” a voice said, in crisp English, from the other side of the line.

“Mr. Willow?”

“That is Professor Willow,” the madman said, his voice calm as ice. “What seems to be the problem?”

“The thing! It escaped!”

The beast’s assault against the door continued. It roared with absolute animalistic fury.

“What thing?” Willow asked, no doubt hearing the terror but speaking no less calmly for it. “Be more specific please.”

“The thing from the central tank!”

“Oh!” the wood of the door snapped and a terrible glowing claw reached out into the tight space. There was a hint of joy in H. Willow’s voice. “If you had to give it a name, what would you call it?”

“What?!” I screamed, as the terrible creature started to force its shining body through the door. “What the hell do you mean?!”

“A name!” Willow’s tone had broken. He was yelling. “If you had to name the creature, what would you name it?”

“Monkeyfish!” I screamed. “Please! Just send help!”

Just as the terrible thing was about to grasp me, a piercing tone rose through the air. It made me clutch at my ears, yet it caused the creature no pain. Instead, the terrible amalgamation cocked its horrid head to the side in curiosity. Slowly, it backed out of the hole in the door it had created for itself.

Descending on all fours, the creature ran off into the hallway. Past the horrid sound, I could hear glass crash out in the lobby. Slowly, the tone subsided. My ears were still ringing from the shrill sound, but from the phone I could hear a labored sigh.

“A poor choice of name,” H. Willow said, with disdain. “Go home. The aquarium is to undergo *repairs*. Return back for your evening shift tomorrow. Sleep well. Think of a better name. Do not be late.”

With that, he hung up.

I was beyond shaken from the experience, and I desperately wanted to be in the safety of my own home, yet the terror refused to leave me. I stood leaned up against the edge of the janitorial closet shaking and broken. For minutes, I cowered until I could will my body to move.

I found the glass entrance of the lobby shattered. Not five meters from the entrance to the aquarium, a manhole cover lay strewn aside. The darkness of the Poprad sewers was dizzying to walk by.

On the far side of the parking lot stood a black van. By it, towered two familiar, identical men. One of them raised his finger to his ear. My phone rang. A blocked number.

“H. Willow speaking,” he said. “Calling to confirm that you will show up for your shift tomorrow and not impede any progress that has been made.”

I did not hesitate to say yes. The two giants were staring straight at me. I had come far too close to death that night to take the risk of crossing H. Willow.

“Splendid,” the mad scientist said, and hung up. As he did, the two men climbed into their van and started the engine. Not wanting to be followed, I fled the parking lot and ducked into the dark park nearby.

The last thing I wanted was for H. Willow, or his men, to know where I lived. As I made my way back home, I avoided all major roads and kept my eye out for the van. Even though I ran most of the way, the journey to my apartment took much longer than usual. By the time I arrived home and calmed down enough to sleep, however, I considered myself safe.

When morning came, that safety proved to be an illusion. The van was waiting outside of my apartment. The two giants stood guard, looking directly at my window.

H. Willow’s men were far too big and my front door was far too flimsy to resist. Briefly, I considered calling in sick to work but I knew they would retrieve me if I wouldn’t go on my own.

When I arrived at the aquarium Mr. Kuffa was waiting for me at the lobby. I had seen the man drunk countless times before, but never like this. The man was soaked in sweat and could barely string a sentence together. Against his better judgement, he watched the security camera footage from the night prior. My boss wanted out. What’s worse, he wanted me to take his place. He wanted *me* to be the one to deal with H. Willow.

The money. Mr. Kuffa kept on focusing on the money. The measly couple hundred Euros that he offered me to keep my mouth shut was only a fraction of Willow’s discretion fund. There were tens of thousands being sent over each month. I could have all of it. I could even have Kuffa’s entire paycheck. All I needed to do was to take on the responsibility of dealing with the mad scientist.

No matter how much I resisted, Mr. Kuffa kept insisting. It wasn’t until I said I would complain about him to H. Willow that he finally closed his mouth. For a moment, a strong enough gust of fear washed through the man where I feared I was witnessing a heart attack, but eventually he staggered off without another word.

That shift, just like the night prior, I avoided the main hall of the aquarium. For about thirty minutes I stared at the innocently aberrant fish in the side tanks. I would have spent the whole night avoiding the location of last night’s horror, were it possible.

At first, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. With repetition and increased volume, however, the sound became unavoidable. Someone was clearing their throat in the main hall of the aquarium. Knowing that there was no avoiding the interloper, I ventured out to the place which I feared most.

Everything in the main hall had been repaired. The mess of broken glass and seaweed had been cleared and the main tank, although empty, was whole once more. In front of the empty aquarium, flanked by his giant henchmen, sat H. Willow.

“Have you thought more about the name?” he asked, with chilling casualness.

It took me a moment to find my words, but when I did, he did not like my response. No, I told him, I have not thought about the name of the horrid abomination I had seen the night prior.

“FishMonkey simply does not roll off the tongue. It’s far too pedestrian for a creature so important. How about AquaApe?”

Not knowing what else to say to the madman, I agreed. AquaApe did sound like a better name. Willow took my response in good stride. He asked me to sit down with him by the aquarium. He had more questions.

His line of inquiry was completely unhinged, yet he asked it with complete calm. H. Willow wanted to know if I found the monstrosity last night ‘cute’ and whether I could consider it a ‘friend’ if it were to defend me in ‘battle.’ The last thing I wanted to do was to continue conversing with the man, yet the dumb gazes of his massive guards kept me talking. They also kept me honest. I feared that it was all a test, that if I was to tell him I found the horrid amalgamation of biology to be ‘friendly’ he would label me a liar and have me disposed of.

I told Willow that I feared the creature, that I was certain it would murder me were it given the chance. My responses were honest, yet they did not please H. Willow. As I spoke, he scribbled angry notes in a flimsy paper notebook he had on his lap. At some point, as I regurgitated the horror I had witnessed last night, he had finally had enough.

“I did exactly as my dreams have told me. I established this aquarium, I have developed the Hybrid genome to near perfection yet, still, your responses displease me.” He took a long pause, tapped his pen on the notebook and then finally closed it. “Perhaps, you’re not meant to survive the final century. Perhaps, your kind simply cannot understand. When the dust settles and the smoke clears, the new generation will embrace the AquaApe and the rest of the Hybrids. That must be it.”

He looked at me for reassurance. Not knowing what else to do, I nodded my head.

Willow’s questions that night made me deeply uncomfortable, yet it wasn’t until his parting words that I truly tasted terror. H. Willow told me he did not trust Mr. Kuffa. The man was a dullard and an alcoholic. There was no reason to replace him just yet, but were something to happen to my boss, I would become the new manager of the aquarium.

It was not a question. It was not a job offer. It was a statement.

As H. Willow and his massive bodyguards left the aquarium, I couldn’t help but think of how sick Mr. Kuffa looked last time I saw [him](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/q2qjz1/%D2%93%D1%8B%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%BC%D0%B8_%D2%9B%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B%D1%80%D2%93%D1%8B/).
