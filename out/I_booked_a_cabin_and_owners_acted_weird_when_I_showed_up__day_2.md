As the evening approached, I was laying in the enormous bathtub, turning on the bubbles. The only thing that would make it better would be moving the bathtub outside, so it would be called a jacuzzi. Closing my eyes, I lowered myself and let my ears submerge and hair float around me, feeling like a beautiful medusa. A photo would be front-page worthy, I bet. I opened my eyes slowly, feeling relaxed, and then I noticed a praying mantis sitting at the edge.

\- Do you bite? - I asked, watching it as it was watching me. As it took a step towards my head, I jumped up - I know it won't hurt me, but isn't it better to be cautious around nasty bugs?

Remembering what the lady told me made me feel uneasy. I got out of the bath. Mantis 1-0 me.

But the evening was very warm - after spending some time on the couch, I went out the door with a towel and a blanket. I laid on the grass in front of the house - the night was perfect for stargazing. Trying my hardest to relax, I felt that my muscles contract. For some reason, I was more than uneasy. I had a sense of being watched, like someone's eyes are crawling up my torso, giving me a slight tingle. I fought this feeling for a while, but gave up again.

\- That's enough. I'm crazy - I said getting up from the cold ground. - Besides, I will get sick - tried to rationalize my decision to not blame it entirely on my paranoia.

As I got up, I looked around the clearing. Just behind the first layer of trees, I noticed something moved and hid behind a tree. It was tall, slim, just as if one of the trees tried to hide from me. I froze and watched if I would notice the movement again. Nothing. I waited some more, beginning to ease my muscles. I went inside to bravely read a book before falling asleep.

Bright and chilly morning caught me in a huge bed, feeling a spike of energy. I wanted to go for a short hike to clear my head. Mist enshrouded the clearing, gently embracing tall grass and trees. The view was worthy of being featured in an Ikea catalog, invoking feelings of calmness, albeit with a touch of mystery as well.

I started my journey by checking out the place I saw something the previous evening in an attempt to calm me down. There were traces on the ground, as though something heavy had been dragged through the forest, but it didn't appear particularly unusual. Perhaps someone had simply dragged an object. Nothing to fret over. No big deal. There were no footsteps, no blood around, nothing really creepy. After that short investigation into my delusions, I opted for the widest path available and started walking. And to be honest, it's really hard to describe my hike. It's easier for me to tell you what wasn't there and hadn't happened than what was and what happened.

&#x200B;

There were no birds nor animals. There was no signal, just as in my cabin. There were no markings on the trees. I haven't heard any birds singing and I didn't notice anything move. After a couple of hours of such a walk, I felt uneasy and I wanted to get back. I had taken different paths at times, but I was confident I could retrace my steps.

Wrong. Dead wrong. Dead as the forest around me.
