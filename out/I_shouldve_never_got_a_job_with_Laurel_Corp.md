I didn’t think it would be anything weird. I was desperate for a job, and the ad was simple. “Night shift, $25 an hour. Must be comfortable with silence.” Sounded fine to me. I hadn’t worked in over a year, and the pay was more than decent. The company, “Laurel Corp.,” didn’t seem to have a website or much of an online presence, but they listed a local address and a number. It was old-fashioned in a way I liked. Maybe not a start-up, but something that had been around a while.

I got an interview a few days later. The guy who interviewed me was named Mr. Reed. He was dressed in an old suit, the kind with the thick wool that made you sweat just looking at it. He didn’t say much. Just asked if I could work late, if I was comfortable with the dark, and if I had any issue with “silence.”

“Do you mean, like, no talking?” I asked, half-joking.

“No talking, no sound,” he replied. His voice was flat, like he wasn’t sure whether he was giving me an answer or another question. “You’ll get a handbook after you’re hired.”

That should’ve been my first clue. But, again, I was in no position to turn down a job, especially one that promised to pay me well.

I started the next week. It was a little strange when I got there—no lights on in the building, just a flickering sign that said “Laurel Corp.,” almost as if the place had been abandoned and forgotten about for years. Mr. Reed handed me a large, thick booklet as soon as I walked in.

“Read this. You start in fifteen minutes,” he said, without even looking at me.

It wasn’t much of a handbook—just a collection of rules and policies, most of which were pretty straight forward. But there were a few odd ones:

No talking after 10:00 p.m.

Keep the lights off unless instructed to turn them on.

Do not leave the premises during your shift.

If the elevator goes to the basement, stay on your floor.

If you hear knocking, do not answer the door.

The rest of it was mundane; policies on breaks, reporting safety hazards, etc. But the last part—about the knocking, caught my attention. It was weird, yeah, but not something I’d raise a fuss about. I didn’t exactly feel “safe” in this place, but I needed the paycheck.

Mr. Reed gave me a key and showed me to the breakroom. It was small, dimly lit, with a few chairs and a vending machine that seemed to have been here longer than the building itself.

“You’ll be in charge of keeping the place quiet. Just… sit at the desk until your shift is over,” he told me. His eyes were unfocused, like he wasn’t fully there.

I asked, “Is that all? No tasks or anything?”

“Just stay,” he said, not looking me in the eye.

The first few hours were uneventful. I sat at the desk in the back of the building, looking out through a window into the dark, empty parking lot. It was dead silent in here, not even a hum from the old computers. The only noise was the occasional rattle of the vending machine, but that stopped after a while, too.

Around 9:30 p.m., I started feeling a little restless. The rules were starting to make me uneasy—especially the one about the basement. I didn’t even know what was down there, but I wasn’t going to find out. It was just a job, right? Get through the night and collect my paycheck.

At 10:00 p.m., things went a little weird. The building was completely still—no sounds, no movement. I tried to listen for anything, but all I could hear was the sound of my own breathing. The minutes dragged on, and I started feeling like I was in a vacuum, isolated from the world.

Then, at 10:30 p.m., I heard a knock. I froze. It came from the hallway. I glanced toward the door. I was certain I hadn’t imagined it, but I didn’t see anyone. I thought about the handbook. “If you hear knocking, do not answer the door.”

I didn’t move. The silence seemed to press in on me, thicker than before. The clock on the wall ticked slowly. Another knock.

My heart raced. The knock sounded urgent, like someone trying to get in, but I remembered the rule. I had to stay put. I didn’t know what was waiting out there, but it wasn’t my job to find out.

I sat there, doing my best to keep calm. Another knock. And then… the sound of footsteps.

I didn’t move. Not a single muscle. I just stared at the door, waiting for whatever would happen next.

The footsteps stopped. And then, nothing.

I waited. It felt like hours, but the clock said it had only been a minute or two. I stood up slowly, trying not to make a sound. I opened the door just a crack and peered out.

There was no one there.

The next night, things got worse.

The knocking started earlier this time, right after I sat down. The door to the breakroom rattled as if someone was trying to force it open. But when I looked through the little glass window in the door, I saw nothing. There was no one in the hall. No footsteps. Nothing.

I was starting to feel like I was losing my mind. It was just a job, right? I kept reminding myself of that. But the silence was oppressive, and the knocking, it was like someone was trying to communicate without words. Maybe they were playing a prank. Or maybe it was the building, settling, creaking… But the air felt wrong. Every second that passed felt more and more like I was waiting for something to happen, something big.

At exactly 10:00 p.m., the door rattled again. Then the knocking came.

This time, I didn’t hesitate. I stood up, went to the hallway, and started to make my way to the stairs. It was just curiosity. I had to know what was behind it. I wasn’t going to leave, but I wasn’t going to sit there, either.

I reached the stairwell. The light flickered as I descended, the staircase steep and narrow. My footsteps echoed loudly as I moved further down. I turned the corner and saw the basement door. It was slightly ajar.

I had never seen the basement before, but now I couldn’t stop myself. I pushed it open.

The air down there was thick with dust. A few light bulbs hung from the ceiling, casting an eerie yellow glow on the concrete floor. The walls were covered in symbols, scratched into the stone, as if someone had been marking the place for years. And then I saw it, something in the corner of the room, hidden under a tarpaulin.

I don’t know why, but I couldn’t look away. My heart pounded in my chest as I approached it. When I finally pulled the tarp off, I gasped.

There were dozens of old photographs pinned to the walls, photos of people I’d never met. And right in the center was a picture of Mr. Reed. His eyes were wide open in the photo, his expression wild, like he was trying to scream, but he couldn’t.

Behind the photo, there was a door. Not part of the basement. Just a hidden door.

I heard a voice. It was faint but unmistakable. It called my name.

“Come here,” it said.

I stepped closer, my heart racing. The room seemed to close in around me. Something in my gut told me this wasn’t just some stupid prank. There was something wrong here, something deep and dark.

Then, the door slammed shut.

The rest of that night, I sat at my desk, shaking, staring at the clock. When the shift ended, Mr. Reed didn’t say anything. Just handed me my paycheck and a pat on the back. He said nothing about the basement or the knocking. I didn’t ask.

I never went back.

But I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right, even after I left Laurel Corp. I tried to forget it, tried to tell myself it was just a strange job with a strange set of rules. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized something else was going on.

I couldn’t stop picturing the basement. The strange symbols, the photos, Mr. Reed’s wild eyes staring at me from the wall. The knocking. The voice. It had been so clear, like it was right behind me, whispering my name.

The night after I quit, I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the basement door, heard the voice calling to me. I got out of bed, pacing the apartment, thinking. I had to go back. I had to know what way down there.

The next morning, I found myself standing outside the building. It was daylight, so it looked completely different. No shadows creeping along the edges of the walls, no eerie silence hanging in the air. It almost seemed like a normal office building, except for the strange smell—the same smell I remembered from the basement, like stale air and dust.

I hesitated. I knew it was a bad idea, but I couldn’t ignore the gnawing curiosity. I stepped inside.

The receptionist at the front desk gave me a half-hearted smile, not recognizing me at first. “Can I help you?” she asked, her voice flat, disinterested.

“I—I used to work here,” I said, not quite sure how to explain why I was back. “I just… I need to speak with Mr. Reed.”

She stared at me for a moment before nodding, not asking any questions. “He’s in the back,” she said, pointing toward the hallway.

I walked toward the back, trying to seem casual, but every step felt like it was leading me deeper into something I couldn’t escape. The building was quieter than I remembered, the air thick with the kind of stillness you only get in places that hold secrets.

I found the door to Mr. Reed’s office. It was cracked open, and I could see him inside, sitting at his desk, flipping through a stack of papers. I knocked lightly.

Mr. Reed looked up, his expression unreadable. “You’re back,” he said, like it was the most normal thing in the world.

“I—yeah,” I said, my voice cracking. “I need to ask about something. Something… about the basement.”

His eyes flickered for a second, almost imperceptibly, but then he gave a tight smile. “The basement? There’s nothing down there,” he said, his voice flat. Too flat. “You should forget about it.”

“I can’t,” I blurted out. “I need to know what’s going on here.”

For a long moment, he didn’t say anything. He just stared at me, like he was deciding how much he could say without giving too much away. Finally, he stood up, the chair creaking beneath him.

“You really want to know, don’t you?” he asked, his voice low, almost a whisper. He stepped toward the door, his eyes locking on mine. “Alright. But you’ll regret it.”

He didn’t give me a chance to respond. He turned and walked down the hallway, past the receptionist, and toward the back stairs. I followed, my heart pounding, the air feeling heavier with every step.

He led me to the basement door, the same one I had seen before, only now it didn’t look so… secretive. It was just a door, a normal door with peeling paint and a rusty doorknob. Mr. Reed opened it with a slow, deliberate motion, and the stale air hit me like a wall. The smell was overpowering, like something that had been sealed away for years.

“You sure about this?” he asked, his voice tight.

I nodded, though my stomach twisted into knots. “I’m sure.”

Mr. Reed stepped inside, and I followed, my feet dragging as I descended the stairs into the basement. The lightbulbs flickered, barely illuminating the space. The air was thick with dust, and I could see the strange symbols on the walls, the same ones I had seen before. But now, there was something else—something newer. More recent.

The photos. They were still there, pinned to the walls, but they had changed. The faces were different. There were pictures of people I didn’t recognize. People who looked familiar in a way that made my skin crawl.

I looked at Mr. Reed, my voice barely a whisper. “What is this place? What’s going on?”

He didn’t answer at first. Instead, he walked to the far corner of the room, where a large, metal door stood. This wasn’t part of the basement I had seen before. It was hidden behind a stack of crates, almost like it had been put there on purpose.

He reached for the handle, his hand trembling just slightly, then opened the door. Beyond it was a narrow hallway that seemed to stretch on forever. The air smelled even worse in here—stale, like death, and something else, something metallic.

“This is where it starts,” Mr. Reed said, his voice barely audible.

I didn’t want to go in. I didn’t want to step into whatever this place was. But I had already come too far. My curiosity had led me here, and now I couldn’t turn back.

I stepped inside, and the door slammed shut behind me.

I turned to find Mr. Reed gone. The hallway stretched out in front of me, the walls covered in the same strange symbols. There were more photos, more people, all of them looking directly at the camera. It felt like they were watching me.

A door at the end of the hallway creaked open.

I didn’t know what I expected to find, but it wasn’t this.

The room beyond the door was filled with rows of chairs, each one occupied by a person—no, not a person. They were… something else. Their faces were blank, their eyes wide and unblinking, staring at nothing. They didn’t move.

And in the center of the room was a pedestal, covered in strange markings, with a glowing stone resting on top.

I didn’t need to ask what it was. I knew. This was where it all came from. This was the heart of whatever Laurel Corp. was.

The stone pulsed with a low hum, and for the first time, I felt like I was being drawn into something much bigger than me. My body moved of its own accord, and before I could stop myself, I was walking toward it.

But then, I heard the knocking.

It wasn’t from the door this time.

It came from the people in the chairs.

And I realized, too late, that I wasn’t meant to be here.

The knocking started softly at first, just a faint tapping, like the sound of knuckles on wood. It grew louder, faster, and then it wasn’t just one knock—it was a chorus, a rhythmic banging that came from each person in the chairs, their hands raised, tapping on the armrests with unnatural precision.

I froze. My body wouldn’t move, not out of fear, but because I felt compelled to stay still, as if I were caught in some strange magnetic field. My chest tightened, and my throat closed up. The knocking was getting louder, a rhythmic, haunting chant in the dark.

Then, the people in the chairs all turned their heads at once.

Their eyes didn’t blink. Their faces, pale and waxen, were locked in place, staring at me. They weren’t alive, not really. But they weren’t dead, either. They were something in between. I could feel their gaze seeping into me, crawling under my skin, filling my mind with a deep, gnawing unease.

I wanted to run. I wanted to scream. But all I could do was stand there, rooted to the spot, staring back at them, like they were waiting for something from me.

A figure emerged from the shadows, walking slowly toward me. It was Mr. Reed, his face drawn and pale. His eyes were wide, bloodshot, as if he hadn’t slept in days. His lips curled into a smile that was more like a grimace.

"You’re here now," he said, his voice a rasp, like something had torn at his vocal cords. "You’ve seen it. Seen the truth." He stepped closer, his shoes scraping against the floor with each step. "But you don’t know why you’re here yet, do you?"

I wanted to scream, but my throat was dry. I managed to choke out a question, my voice barely a whisper. "What... what is this? What’s happening?"

Mr. Reed laughed, a hollow, empty sound that echoed through the room. "It’s happening because you wanted to know. You wanted to see behind the curtain. And now, you’re part of it. You’re not just a bystander anymore."

I tried to back up, but my legs felt like they were made of lead. I couldn’t move. It was like the room had turned into quicksand, dragging me deeper and deeper into something I couldn’t escape.

"Those people," he continued, his voice softening into something almost... tender. "They came here, just like you. They wanted to know. And now, they’re waiting. Waiting for you."

"Waiting for me?" I said, shaking my head in disbelief. "What do you mean waiting for me?"

But Mr. Reed didn’t answer. He reached for the pedestal, and the stone on top began to glow brighter, its light flickering like a heartbeat.

"Take it," he said, his voice barely audible over the rising hum of the stone. "Take the stone. It’s the only way."

I could feel the pulse of it, like a force calling to me, urging me to reach out. I fought it, tried to resist, but my hand moved of its own accord, inching toward the stone.The moment my fingers brushed against it, everything went dark.

I woke up with a start, gasping for air. The cold, stale air of the basement was gone, replaced by the warm, dry air of my apartment. I sat up, heart pounding in my chest, my head spinning.

I glanced around, disoriented, my hands shaking. My apartment was exactly as I’d left it, no strange symbols on the walls, no weird photos staring at me from the corners.

Had it all been a dream? A nightmare?

I rubbed my eyes, trying to make sense of what had just happened. But something was wrong. The air felt thick, oppressive, like there was something hanging in the room with me, something that shouldn’t be there.

I stood up, my feet unsteady, and walked toward the kitchen. I needed something to calm my nerves. Maybe a drink. Maybe I could forget this whole mess and pretend it was all just some weird dream.

But as I reached the counter, my heart stopped.

On the counter, sitting neatly in front of me, was the stone.

It was glowing.

And as I stared at it, I could hear the knocking. It was faint at first, but it was unmistakable. Knuckles tapping against the surface, one by one, like a chorus of voices in the distance.

I turned away from it, my breath coming in short gasps. This couldn’t be happening. I hadn’t gone back to the building. I hadn’t taken the stone. I hadn’t.

But I had. In some way, I had.

I stepped backward, my mind racing. The knock was louder now, almost deafening. I couldn’t take it anymore. I couldn’t handle the weight of whatever had just happened.

I grabbed the stone, my fingers cold against its surface, and I held it up in front of me. The knocking stopped. The room went silent.

I dropped the stone, and it landed with a soft thud on the floor.

The moment it hit the ground, the room went black.

I woke up again.

But this time, I wasn’t in my apartment anymore. I woke up again, but this time the air was different, thicker, colder. I was no longer in my apartment. I was in a place that felt alien, like I had crossed into some parallel dimension, or perhaps somewhere much darker than that.

The walls around me were made of rough stone, like a cave or a forgotten underground structure. There was no ceiling, just an endless blackness above me, swallowing any trace of light. I could barely make out shapes in the gloom, shadows that shifted and moved just out of the corner of my vision. The air smelled damp and metallic, the scent of rust mixing with something faintly like decay.

I stood up slowly, my body aching as though I had been asleep for a long time, but the more I tried to focus, the more it seemed like I wasn’t really awake. My mind was fuzzy, my thoughts slipping through my fingers like sand.

Then, I heard the knocking.

It was the same rhythm as before, persistent, deliberate. It wasn’t coming from any one direction, but from all around me, echoing off the walls like it was part of the very structure of this place. It was unnerving, unsettling, like I had crossed into a world where time and space didn’t behave as they should.

I turned in circles, trying to make sense of it, but I couldn't escape the sound. It was in my head now. My thoughts were filled with it. The knocking was drowning everything out, its relentless beat growing louder with each passing moment. And then, I saw them. The figures. The people from the basement.

They were standing in a circle, their faces pale and featureless, their eyes locked on me. They didn’t move. They didn’t blink. They just stood there, like statues, waiting.

My heart slammed in my chest. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. I opened my mouth, but the words were lost, drowned by the oppressive silence that had filled the space between the knocking.

One of them stepped forward. It was Mr. Reed. His face was even more gaunt than I remembered, his skin stretched too thin over his bones, his eyes wide and hollow. He reached out a hand, slowly, deliberately, as if to touch me, but I took a step back.

"No," I whispered, my voice trembling. "No, please, I don’t—"

But he didn’t stop. His hand reached toward me, his fingers cold as ice. He was closer now, his face mere inches from mine. His breath was shallow, ragged.“You took it,” he said, his voice distorted, like it was coming from miles away. "You wanted to know. You wanted to see."

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t look away from his eyes, and the words hit me like a wave. Everything that had happened, the strange job, the rules, the basement, the stone, it was all part of this. Part of them. Part of whatever this place was.

"You’ve crossed the line," Mr. Reed continued. "You’re here now. Like all the others before you."

His voice dropped to a whisper. “But you’re different. You… you’re already part of it. This place. This… thing.”

I could feel the weight of his words pressing down on me. I didn’t know how, but I knew it was true. Something in me had changed. Something inside me had snapped, and now there was no way out.

The circle of figures around me shifted, their heads tilting in unison, their eyes never leaving me. And that’s when I noticed it, the stone, glowing faintly at the center of the circle. It was no longer just an object. It had become part of them, part of everything. The stone pulsed with the rhythm of the knocking, as though it were alive, beating like a heart.

I had a choice now. It felt like it, at least. But there was no real choice. It was either embrace what had happened to me, join whatever this was, or...

The knocking grew louder. Louder than I thought possible. It filled the room, reverberating through the air, through my very bones.

And then, I understood.

I was never meant to leave. This was where they gathered those who sought the truth, those who wanted to know, those who asked too many questions. This was the endgame. The price.

I reached for the stone, and when my fingers touched it, the room exploded into light.

I woke up again.

This time, I was standing outside the building, under the harsh fluorescent lights of the parking lot. The air smelled of burnt rubber and exhaust. My body felt heavy, like I hadn’t moved in days, but when I looked at the clock on my phone, it was only a few hours later.

I blinked, unsure if what I had experienced was real. Maybe it had all been some kind of waking nightmare. Maybe it had all been a dream.

The weight in my pocket.

I reached into my jacket and pulled out the stone.

It was glowing, just faintly, like a heartbeat. It pulsed against my fingers, sending a shiver down my spine.

And then I heard it again, the knocking. Faint, but unmistakable.

I dropped the stone, and it hit the ground with a soft thud. For a brief moment, the knocking stopped. The world held its breath.

But I knew. I knew it wasn’t over. It wasn’t going to stop. I had crossed the line, just like all the others before me.

There's no going back now.
