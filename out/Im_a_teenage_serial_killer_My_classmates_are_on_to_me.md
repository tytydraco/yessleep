I never meant to be a killer. Not at first.

It started with "Travis Langley".

He was the kind of person that made life unbearable. The kind of bully who didn’t just hurt people—he broke them, hollowed them out with his words, his fists, his sheer presence. I was one of his favorite targets. Maybe it was because I was quiet, maybe because I didn’t fight back.

I remember the day I killed him so vividly it plays in my head like a scene in a movie. It was late. The school hallways were empty except for the buzzing of fluorescent lights and the distant sound of the janitor’s mop sloshing against the tile. "Travis" had cornered me near the back staircase, his usual smirk in place, his hands already grabbing at my collar, shoving me against the lockers hard enough to make my skull ring.

“You really think you can just walk past me and not say anything, freak?”

I didn’t say anything then either. I just pulled the knife.

He was too shocked to react at first, like his brain couldn’t comprehend the sudden shift in power. He was still processing when I pushed the blade into his stomach. The feeling was strange—almost effortless, like slicing into a ripe fruit. The warmth of his blood spread over my hands as he gasped, eyes wide with disbelief.

“You—” He never finished his sentence.

I stood there, breathing heavily, watching the life drain out of his eyes. And I felt… nothing. No guilt. No regret. Just a quiet, satisfying calm.

That was when I realized something about myself.

I didn’t care.

No one missed "Travis Langley". Not really. Sure, there were a few half-hearted announcements at school, a candlelight vigil no one actually cared about, but the truth was, the world was better off without him. His absence was a relief.

But I had a problem.

A body.

So I did what any rational person would do—I made it disappear.



I found the factory by accident.

It was one of those abandoned places no one thought about anymore, rusted machines gathering dust, crumbling walls covered in graffiti. A perfect place to hide something—or someone.

That’s where "Travis" went.

At first, I just buried him in the dirt-stained concrete floor, deep enough that even rats wouldn’t find him. But then… I got an idea.

I had always been fascinated with preservation. The thought of stopping time, of keeping something exactly as it was forever. It wasn’t hard to get the right supplies—formaldehyde, wax, plaster. I read books, watched videos. I experimented.

"Travis" was my first.

His face, frozen in an expression of pain and surprise, was the first in what would become my collection.

And then I realized something else.

I liked it.



People started noticing when the disappearances didn’t stop.

After "Travis", it was a homeless man no one cared about. Then a girl from another school, someone I had watched from afar. Then another student, then a teacher. Each time, I got better. Smoother. More careful.

But rumors spread fast in high school.

There were whispers, theories, social media posts dissecting every disappearance. People loved the idea of a serial killer in their midst—it was thrilling, like a horror movie come to life.

And then came her.

"Emily Carter".

Perfect. Popular. The kind of girl who had never spoken a word to me in her life. She had a podcast, one of those true crime things people listen to while doing homework or pretending to care about the world. At first, I didn’t pay attention.

Until she made the announcement.

"Tomorrow, I’ll be revealing my top suspect in the town Disappearances. And guess what? They go to our school."



I had no choice.

I waited after school, watching from a distance as she packed up her things, said goodbye to her friends, and started walking home alone. She was always alone. That was what made her so good at observing others—she lived outside of them.

I followed.

She must have noticed me, because she turned around before I could make a move. Her expression was unreadable, but there was something calculating in her eyes.

“You,” she said. Just that.

I smiled. “Want to see something cool?”



The factory was cold and damp, the air thick with the smell of decay masked by chemicals. I led her inside, deeper into the darkness, past the rusted machinery and crumbling walls.

And then she saw them.

Lined up along the far wall, like grotesque mannequins in an abandoned store. Some were seated, some were posed as if caught mid-conversation, their faces frozen in eternal expressions of shock, fear, or confusion. Their skin was pale, almost waxen. Some had glass eyes to replace the ones that had rotted away. Others still had remnants of real hair.

"Emily" made a sound—a strangled, choked gasp.

I stepped closer, until I could feel the shudder of her breath against my skin.

“You’re going to drop the podcast,” I said softly. “You’re going to tell everyone you were wrong. That it was just a stupid theory.”

She didn’t speak.

“If anyone finds out…” I gestured toward the sculptures. “I’ll add your family to my collection. And then I’ll make sure you match.”

I could see the moment she broke. Her eyes were wet, but she nodded.

“I won’t say anything,” she whispered.

I believed her.

For now.



The next day, her podcast came out with a new episode.

"I was wrong," she said, voice shaky but controlled. "The town Disappearances? Just a coincidence. No killer. No monster. Just rumors."

She was good at lying. But I was better at knowing when people were scared.

And she was terrified.

I smiled to myself as I listened, letting her voice lull me into a sense of satisfaction.

She wouldn’t talk.

But if she did…

Well.

I still had room for more sculptures.
