“Jen, I don’t know what to say,” Kara looked past me as she picked at our anniversary dinner, “Life changes, moves on, settles down. We can’t be two crazy kids getting it on in empty lecture halls forever, you know?”

Seven years is no joke when you’re in your twenties. We’d both finished college, moved in together, found boring office jobs. Considered getting a cat, but Kara didn’t want to be a ‘stereotypical lesbian’, whatever that was, so we never went through with it. The spark that fueled us through tough times had dimmed into a familiar, superficial sort of glow. I cared for Kara, but I missed the heat.

“I think I need that, though,” I said into my plate, “I need some excitement, something that spices up the monotony of everyday existence. I need inspiration, and I need to be touched without having to beg for it, Kara.”

We broke up that night. Neither of us cried or tried to fight to save the relationship. I think that’s what stung the most. A partnership stone-cold and buried long before we called it quits. My old group of friends - the ones I’d hardly seen in the last five years - were thrilled to have me back.

“You know how we celebrate, uh, I mean, commiserate a breakup, don’t you?” Sue’s voice barked through the phone, “Or have you been away from us so long you’ve forgotten?”

“Oh God,” I covered my eyes with my free palm, “Sue, no, I don’t think that’s - ”

“Strip club, Jenny-boo,” Sue laughed, “It’s tradition after all, and we’ve been waiting for you to come around for ages. That boring old hag of yours was dragging you down.”

“Don’t talk about Kara like that,” I snapped, suddenly defensive, “I mean, I don’t know if I’m up for all that.”

“That’s the whole point, Jen,” Sue’s voice softened, “I’ll pick you up tonight. Text you the time later.”

With that, my oldest and bossiest friend hung up. I wondered why I felt so guilty about going out and realized it was probably years of Kara looking down on my butch friends and their perverted hobbies. *Enough of that*, I decided, there was no harm in having a little fun.

*Cals Gals* was a strip club on the outskirts of our city. Sue always made a point of hitting the cheapest, seediest joints for our post-breakup shindigs. These places were mostly frequented by working-class men and teenage boys who heard there would be no bouncers at the door. The dancers were either overweight single moms or stick-thin meth heads with cheap implants.

*Really? You’re seriously going to take part in the further degradation of these unfortunate women?* Kara’s voice rang in my head, and I ordered a round of vodka shots in hopes of shutting that part of my brain off.

Things picked up from there. The girls and I started shooting the shit, reminiscing as the booze hit the sweet spot. It felt good to relax and unwind. Sue and the rest of the crew talked shit on Kara, and I let them. It felt really good to hear someone tear her apart.

“That stuck up higher than thou hoity-toity hipster feminazi tofu-eating headscarf-wearing -”

The night wore on, and the women on stage grew older, sadder. I was pretty drunk and tired, almost ready to call it a night when the crackly speaker announced the next dancer. I didn’t catch her name, because I wasn’t all that interested until I saw her.

She walked onto the stage in red stilettos and a mesh bodysuit that covered nothing and enhanced everything. Her black hair hung just below the shoulder blades, bouncing with the music. She had a heart-shaped face that was all eyes and lip, and a cute pixie nose sprinkled in freckles. There was a coyness in her eyes, a sense of command in her posture. Her movements were fluid, effortless. Our entire table quieted.

“Right, Jen,” Sue yelled over the blaring music, “I think it’s time we add a new clause to this tired old tradition, don’t you?”

I would have asked what she was talking about, but I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the stage. The dancer was gyrating on the pole, feline and primal, rubbing the metal between her full, natural breasts.

“All right, it’s all arranged,” Sue said, appearing behind me. I hadn’t even realized she had gone anywhere.

“What are you talking about?” I asked as the song ended and the performer left the stage.

“Consider this a birthday gift for every year from now until your sixtieth,” Sue laughed, “I had to outbid some other enthusiasts, but that babe is waiting to give you a lapdance in the backroom.”

I could have played it humble, cool. I could’ve said no, surely that was not the sort of thing I wanted, but I was quite drunk at that point and who was I kidding? I wanted it. I wanted *her*. I got up and walked to the backroom, ignoring the howls of laughter rising from our table as I swayed and stumbled.

Maybe I shouldn’t have had so much vodka.

The backroom was exactly what you would expect. Neon-lamps colored peeling walls in pink. The air was thick with sweat and cigarette smoke. There was a small stage with a pole, and a patchy armchair for me to sit in. Soberly, I wished I’d brought some hand sanitizer. Drunkenly, I thought *fuck it* and sat down on the stained cushion, staring at the curtains at the back of the stage.

A minute passed before she emerged, somehow even more surreal up close. Her skin was smooth, flawless. Her eyes glowed green, full lips parting in a lipstick smile. The curves of her body spilled through the mesh, driving me wild as they bounced with the gravity of each step.

“Hi,” I said, trying to be polite, as though this were anything but a dirty backroom encounter, “What is your name?”

“Zaskia, darling,” she purred, climbing on top of me, whipping her hair back with a practiced twist of the neck. Her back arched as she plunged her manicured fingertips into the cushions of her breasts, pushing them up as she gyrated in my lap.

I couldn’t remember the last time I’d been so turned on. It must have been literal years since intimacy with Kara had felt anything like this, and even then it couldn’t quite compare. My whole body ached with longing, my hips twitched to the rhythm of Zaskia’s lap dance. Even though she wasn’t touching me, a familiar pressure started building in my pelvis. It slowed my breathing and sent shivers through my entire body.

I know you aren’t supposed to touch a stripper during a lap dance. At least, that’s what TV shows and movies had led me to believe, but no one at *Cals Gals* had said a word, and I was too turned on to resist.

I buried my face in Zaskia’s chest, bringing my mouth down on her right nipple. I felt the ridges grow hard on my tongue as I sucked through the mesh, savoring the taste of sweat and skin. Her scent enveloped me in notes of lavender, citrus, and something earthy. Zaskia let out a moan, the frequency of her hip movements increasing.

I could tell she liked my touch.

I used my left hand to hold, squeeze, and massage her left breast as my free palm ran down her stomach, over her vibrating inner thigh, right down to her waxed, wet lips. I wrapped her swollen clit between two fingers, gently jerking it to the rhythm of her swaying hips. Zaskia bucked against my hand, pressing her upper body against me, breasts smothering my face. I freed my left hand and used it to plunge three fingers inside her.

She was warm, tight, and incredibly wet.

The way Zaskia’s walls throbbed against my fingers sent bolts of pleasure through my whole body. It was like the mere touch of her was enough to transform the surface of my skin into one endless erogenous zone. I had to stop myself from grinding my vulva into the seam of my jeans. This wasn’t the time to dry hump my way into shallow ecstasy.

Her pleasure came first.

“You’re so beautiful,” I groaned, planting supple kisses on her shoulders and neck.

Zaskia began to lose control, her body movements no longer a paid performance but a symphony of pleasure. I kept a steady pace of finger thrusting and clit rubbing as she collapsed on top of me, digging her nose into my neck as her moans grew quiet, throaty, sincere. I watched her round ass ripple as she drove herself into my hand over and over again.

I could feel it coming on, so I rubbed harder, plunged deeper. Zaskia started shaking all over, moaning strings of words I couldn’t understand.

She was so close.

There was a loud crunching noise as a sharp pain broke out in my left hand. I recoiled instantly, attempting to pull my fingers out of Zaskia, but they wouldn’t budge. I used my upper body strength to try and shove her off, but I couldn’t move her. Her limbs were wrapped around me like a clamp, pinning me to the back of the armchair.

Another stabbing pain permeated my alcohol buzz, shooting adrenaline through my dopamined  brain. I used all my strength to escape the painful snatch, but the stripper tightened her hold on the rest of my body as I pulled and tugged.

“No, no, fuck,” I yelled, horror sobering my thoughts and movements.

I gathered myself and gave a final, desperate pull with all the strength my body could muster. My hand came free with the sound of bones crunching. I broke out in feverish sweat, hyperventilating as I raised my blood-soaked arm to see teeth marks encircling my knuckles. Three fingers dangled off my hand by thin strands of nerve and muscle tissue. Surges of blood pumped out of the knuckle stumps with every beat of my heart.

I started screaming, trying to pull my other arm free, elbowing Zaskia’s matted, black hair. It was pointless, she wouldn’t move an inch. The fingers on my right hand were still pressed up against her clit, which felt different. It was cold and hard, rough like a pebble. Also, it was moving. Not the clit itself, but the opening below. It was stretching and closing, snapping its way to a fresh batch of fingers.

“Jesus fuck,” I screamed, spraining my wrist as I bent my hand backward, away from the mongering muff.

Zaskia pulled back, sitting upright on top of me, but she didn’t look like Zaskia anymore.

The woman in my lap was at least seventy, her skin thin and flakey, like that of a molting snake. She had two thin slits for eyes and bleach-white eyebrows. Her lips were thin, cracked, and her smile was missing five teeth. She wrapped a hand around my throat when I tried to move, pinning me back.

She raised her free arm so I could see it. One minute, it was a mesh-covered, wrinkled old limb. The next, it grew maroon scales, the fingertips sprouting claws the size of eagle beaks. Her smile widened as she brought the tip of the claw to my neck, grazing the skin to send trickles of blood sliding down to my collarbone.

I screamed again. For Sue, the girls, the Johns in the front. Anyone. Everyone. I was too young to die in the backroom of a shady strip club. That was some midlife crisis bullshit, and I wasn't even thirty yet.

"Please," I begged the sagging monster in my lap, desperate to find a trace of the human in those snake eyes, "I'll do anything, please just let me go."

The woman threw her head back, stretching her mouth to laugh. That faint earthy scent came back, only it wasn’t so subtle this time. I dry heaved as wafts of decay hit my nostrils and stung my eyes. Her breath smelled like a pile of dead rabbits thrown in a sewage tank filled with period blood.

The slits of her eyes turned red as she dragged the claw from my neck all the way down my torso, slicing open my t-shirt, jeans, and skin. I looked down to see a steady flow of blood gushing out onto the flaps of fabric that hung off my chest. The certainty of death enveloped my body in stupor as my arms and legs turned to stone beneath the woman's weight. Hot tears poured down my face as I waited for my short, boring life to flash before my eyes. Whatever this scaly woman wanted, she would get.

I closed my eyes as she started ripping at my jeans.

I held my breath and waited for death.

“What the - ” Zaskia growled, standing up from the armchair, “You’re not a man?”

“Wha-?” I mumbled, disoriented from boozing, blue-ball ovaries, and blood loss. I tried to get up from the armchair but only managed to slide off it, crumpling in a heap on the sticky floor.

“You don’t have a penis. You’re a woman.”

I looked up at Zaskia. She was still old and toothless, but her eyes looked human and the scaly claw hand was gone.

“I actually don’t identify either which way,” I said, “I consider myself to be non-binary.”

“Jesus Christ,” the old woman walked over to the stage and leaned up against it. She pulled a cigarette from her black nest of hair and lit it with a huff of breath. The mesh sagged off her skinny frame, collecting in ruffles at the bottom of her pot belly. Her toes dangled over the edges, yellowed toenails curling like cat claws against the stiletto pads. Zaskia tapped the bony fingertips of her free hand against the stage as she smoked.

“You kids and your damn androgyny and internet porn addiction. You should have seen this place back in the 70s. There was an endless supply of Johns. We had blood fountains in the back office and gorged ourselves like there was no tomorrow. I’d have six testicles for breakfast, eight for lunch, and only one heart for dinner because I was watching my weight. Now I’m lucky if I get a kill every three days.”

My head spun, my vision blurred. It was getting increasingly difficult to process my surroundings.

“I should have known you weren’t a man. You were too good at, well, you know,” the woman’s frame spun in my vision, neon lights dancing around my head like fireworks, “Although there was that nice Rockefeller boy. Came in here at the start of the 60s. Generous young-un he was, bought drinks for the whole house, took me in the backroom, spread my legs and lapped me up like a pup with a bone. Got me so damn excited I bit half his head off right then and there.”

The woman let out a cackle, then started coughing from the depths of her wheezing lungs. I tried to say something, but the minute I opened my mouth, my body started convulsing and I vomited onto the floor.

“Ah shit, I better get you some help,” Zaskia stubbed out her cigarette and rushed over to me, “I cut you up pretty bad didn’t I?”

With those words the world around me went black. I wanted to say something, to call for help, but I was too weak. I must have passed out then, because the next thing I knew I was at this hospital, my hand and torso in bandages, Sue by my side, police asking questions.

I don’t know what to tell any of them. I’m still trying to make sense of it myself. So far I’m coming up short in the theory department. Either someone laced my drink with some high-grade hallucinogens and I drunkenly stumbled into a shredder. Or...

All of it was real and [I just fingered a succubus](https://www.reddit.com/r/peculi_Dar/comments/mhn59n/succubus_stripper_story_notes_discussion/).
