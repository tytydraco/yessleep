This happened a few years ago, and I still don’t know if I ever truly left that forest.

Back then, I worked as a hiking guide on the outer trails of Aokigahara. Most people know it as Japan’s Suicide Forest. It’s as eerie as the rumors say—silent, suffocating, unnaturally still. But I didn’t take the job chasing ghost stories. I was broke, desperate, and too numb to care where I ended up.

For a while, it was just a job. Tourists came and went. I gave the same safety warnings: never stray off the path, never follow any strange sounds, and if you see a rope tied to a tree… don’t follow it. That’s someone’s final decision.

Then came the day I broke my own rule.

One Sunday, my group canceled. I should’ve gone home. But I didn’t. Something tugged at me—a curiosity, or maybe something worse. I’d heard whispers of a hidden trail not marked on any map. A trail where compasses spin, electronics die, and sometimes… people just vanish.

I found it. And I followed it.

The air turned heavy. My GPS glitched out. The chalk I used to mark trees? Vanished when I looked back. I should’ve turned around. But then I saw something impossible.

A vending machine.  
In the middle of the forest. No path, no power source, but it was glowing—lit from within like it was brand new.

It was stocked full of drinks.

I felt like I was being pulled toward it. My ears rang. I was shaking. I don’t even remember reaching into my pocket, but suddenly I was holding a coin. Yen. I hadn’t carried cash in months.

I inserted the coin. A drink dropped.

I picked it up...  
And saw my own name printed on the label.

“For Him: One Last Memory.”

It was warm.

I ran. I sprinted back through the trees, but everything felt wrong. Branches clawed at me. I swear they moved. Whispering followed me, words that weren’t quite human. I tripped, slammed into the dirt, and landed on… a jacket.

My jacket.

But older. Torn. Caked in dried blood.

Inside the pocket was a phone.

My phone.

It was full of photos. Of me. Sleeping in the forest. Some from high up in the trees. Some right next to my face.

I hadn’t taken a single one.

Then I heard my voice. Not just a sound that *sounded* like me—*my* voice. Whispering from the trees.

“You shouldn’t have come alone.”

I don’t know how I escaped. I woke up just past the treeline. The drink was still in my jacket pocket. Its label now blank. Still warm.

I quit the job. Moved cities. Burned the clothes. Tried to forget.

But it didn’t end.

Sometimes I wake up standing in the woods. Forests I don’t recognize. Always barefoot. Always holding that same drink.

No matter what I do, it finds its way back to me.

So I keep it.  
On a shelf in my apartment.  
Still sealed.  
Still warm.

If you ever go to Aokigahara and see a vending machine that shouldn’t be there—don’t buy anything.  
Even if it knows your name.
