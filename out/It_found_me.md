"Sleep. Just go to sleep. It'll be over in the morning. You can do it. You can sleep it off. Ignore the knocking," I tried to keep myself from going completely crazy from the knocking on my window. "Don't open your eyes," I either *thought*, or I *whispered* under my breath. Everything is a blur.

  
Ever since I accepted the job offer, my life's become a living hell. I can't go to the grocery, exercise, or even go to work without ~~feeling~~ ***knowing*** something is following me.



I'll provide some context. Last month, I, Jonathan Michaels, fresh out of college at 22, I applied for a job at a new company, Brighter Days Inc. It was a sort of... well, I don't wanna say *asylum*... it didn't seem like it was *that* serious. Just a mental health facility.

  
I was so excited to pursue my dreams, helping people understand the power of their minds. For brighter days, as the company said.

  
For the first 3 days, I worked as an assistant, helping the other nurses, serving people coffee, things like that. On the 4th day, I was *finally* tasked to serve a patient. I was **nervous**, but more excited, probably.

  
"So, are there any problems you're currently facing?" I asked the patient before beginning the consultation. I was working as a psychologist, with my own office and everything. She maintained a fairly friendly aura, before she actually started speaking.

  
"No... it's more like... a problem is facing ***me,***" the patient replied.

  
I was intrigued, not too scared yet. I didn't study 4 years to give up from *that*. "What exactly *is* this problem*?*" I asked next.

  
She paused. Then she said, "It started with a dream." She paused again. I still remained silent, as she looked to be thinking of a way to speak the next sentence. "A man. No, wait..." she struggled, "A figure. It was a figure. Was it? No, maybe not," she retracted every explanation she tried to give, as my curiosity peaked.

  
"An entity," she spoke, sounding sure this time. "It was an entity. A black shadow-like figure. It had a hunched back, glowing white eyes, and dinosaur-like arms and legs, clawed and everything. It was like a breed of a shadow, some *demonic* contorted T-Rex, and a *disturbingly* tall man."

  
I paused, maybe a *little* nervous this time, but not backing down. "Ok... and what did he do?" I asked.

  
"He **stared**. That stare... it haunts me in my dreams. In life. He's everywhere," she cried quietly. Whenever my nervousness increased, my curiosity increased 2x more.

  
"He stared?" I asked, "When did he start staring? *Why* did he start staring? Did he do anything else?" I had a million other questions, but I bit my tongue to hear her out.

  
"He lurked around me at times, following me wherever I went. It seemed like he was growing bigger the more scared I grew of him. This is the only place I've ever felt safe. I made a good decision coming here," she said.

  
"He started staring around when my husband died. He went missing and was found drowned in a lake a week after. Always screaming that he would kill someone," she added, "And I don't know *why* the **entity** started coming after *me*."

  
I paused for a while, trying to collect my rushing thoughts. "Alright. When was the last time you saw this entity?" I asked.

  
"He chased me here, but I never saw him again since being here. It's been about a week," she replied.

  
"Ok, Alice, I need you to know that you're safe here. That he *won't* hurt you, ok?" I spoke.

  
"I know," she said, eerily. I always wondered what it meant. For someone who had been so scared speaking of it, "I know" seemed like a weird thing to reply.

  
The rest of the days, she spoke about how she misses her kids, mother, and husband. I was always curious about this "husband" of hers. I assumed it was a sensitive topic, so I chose to steer clear of it for the time being.

  
About a week after the first incident, she looked scared to see me when I entered her room. "No! No! I want a different person! Someone else! Someone else, *please*! Not this one!" she screamed.

  
"Alice, it's me. Johnathan. Remember?" I spoke softly, trying to comfort her.

  
"I know! That's the problem!" she shouted.

  
The nurse tried escorting her out, but I told her to let her stay. I was intrigued. "What's wrong?" I asked.

  
"I saw it again." she lowered her voice, as her demeanor changed... more **sinisterly**. Mysterious.

  
"What did it do? Did it attack you?" I asked her.

  
"No, it doesn't want *me* anymore," she replied, before finally looking me in the eyes, almost smirking a little, "It wants ***you***."

  
I felt a shiver strike through my spine. "Me? Why does it want me?" I asked, still trying to keep it light and maintain my composure.

  
She started **laughing. Like a** ***maniac*****.** It scared me, for the first time since I started working here. Then, she stood up, and left.

  
I had a hard time sleeping that night. I kept hearing whispering, I assumed it was the wind.

  
And then I heard a female voice whisper, "She told you didn't she?" I gasped and *jumped* out of bed, my eyes still *wincing* from the rheum that had formed in my eyes. In the wincing state of my eyes, I thought I had seen a figure in the corner of my room, its' head peeking out from the side of the dresser.

  
But when I opened my eyes after rubbing the rheum out, it was gone. That's when it started. With a **dream**, as the woman stated. Upon the following days, I felt like I was being followed ***everywhere***. Alice was discharged within 2 weeks, and I didn't see her for a while after that.

  
The man however, I saw *frequently*. Either from the corner of my eye, or in my dreams. It was just like she had described. A black distorted shadow figure, that just **stared**.

  
I would have rather it attacked me than just stared. That stare was soul-piercing. It's as if every fear I had ever had was morphed into existence in the form of this figure and stared at me with the intensity and passion of a *million* red giants.

  
I took a break from my job, after that. It was too much for me to handle.

  
Until ***it found me***. Three nights ago was the first time I had ever seen it fully, standing in front of my bed, after I woke up in the middle of the night. Only this time, it didn't disappear. It continued staring, and it's as if the figure got *bigger and bigger* the longer it stayed. I couldn't speak to it or form any sentences or words. I just stared, and so did it. After what felt like an hour, my neighbor must have dropped a pan or something, loud enough for me to look away. And when I looked back, the figure was ***gone***.

  
I was told I'd be fired if I took any more sick days from work, so I was *forced* to go back to work the next day. Alice was there, packing the last of the things she had brought from when she stayed here. I ran to her, and she looked shocked.

  
I had eyebags under my eyes, disheveled and wrinkled clothes, and messy hair.

  
I asked her, "Please help me! Please! Why is it following *me* this time?" Tears began to well in my eyes.

  
She hugged me, then looked me in the eyes. Tears formed in hers' too. "I'm sorry. *I had to give it to someone*. ***Like my husband did to me,***" she spoke, as she wiped the tears from her eyes, hiding a dark smirk across her lips.
