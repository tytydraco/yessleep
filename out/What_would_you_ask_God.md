If God was right in front of you and you could ask him anything, what would you ask? The purpose of life? Is there life on other planets out there? Is the universe infinite? Is free will an illusion? 

These are all questions I've wondered my entire life. I always felt I was different from most other people. I felt that most people just lived their lives on autopilot mode. Drifting through life and just taking and accepting whatever is put out in front of them. Rarely questioning anything, rarely applying critical thinking to anything that happens no matter how big or small it is. If I was being honest, I felt superior to most people, but I knew deep down it didn't matter. It didn't matter how smart or enlightened I thought I was, at the end of the day I was no different, in fact, I was arguably worse off than them. Because at least they were happy. The age-old saying "ignorance is bliss" always came to mind. I worked a boring normal factory job, had 1 serious girlfriend my entire life at age 26, and had no goals or ambitions. My life was utterly pathetic and meaningless. I was just waiting for my moment to start. For my life to actually start. That would've been the worst thing I could do, if it hadn't actually worked out in a way.

It all started a week ago. I had just gotten to my apartment after a long 12 hour shift at work. My body was exhausted and my mind drained. I took a nice cold shower and then realized I had no frozen food to heat up. I was so tired that there was no way I was going to make anything to eat and certainly no way I was going to go out to get some food. So I ordered food online, as much as I hate doing it. Having to pay double the price for the price of comfort was almost never worth it, but this was one of the few exceptions where it was. I ordered from a McDonalds which wasn't even 5 minutes away, and I wanted my food ASAP, so I put in a nice $5 tip hoping that it would my driver fly to me. 

30 minutes passed by, and still nothing. My order had been picked up almost immediately when I put it in, and yet now it just wasn't even showing anything. It was marked as "Delivered" yet there was nothing at my door! I was furious. Cursing at whoever was the person who stole my food. I was in the middle of calling the McDonalds when I heard my door bell ring. I go and check it, and there's a brown bag sitting there. I picked it up and noticed it was sealed, it had nothing on it though, it was completely plain. I close and lock my door, and bring the bag inside. I tear the bag open, and there's a phone in there. I thought to myself that someone made a grave mistake, and someone at the McDonalds had dropped their phone inside and sealed the bag somehow. I knew that was pretty absurd though, how does someone make that kind of mistake? 

I turned on the phone because it was shut off, and as I was expecting to see the locked screen of whoever's phone it was, instead I see  a white screen with black letters on it. It says "Ask me anything and I will tell you the answer." 

At first I thought maybe this was the lock screen, just a screenshot or some abstract art. I quickly realized that wasn't the case, and there was no way to open anything else up on the phone. All I could do was type something in. So I decided to type in "Who am I?" to see what the response would be. Within a second the words popped up on the screen "Eric " Along with my last name that I won't post for obvious reasons. I got chills as soon as I saw that. A lot of things went through my mind at that moment, but what would confirm anything would be my next question. 

Who are you?

Again in a mere second the words popped up.

God.

I thought okay well, that's the obvious answer if someone was going to make a phone like this that pranked people. I had no idea whoever sent this phone to how they knew my name. I didn't really have any friends and none of them knew where I lived. I used a fake name on the food delivery app (don't ask, I'm just very paranoid). So it really didn't make any sense. I thought of asking a complex question. A question that whatever this was, wouldn't be a predetermined answer.

What did I dream about this morning?

You were at a farm and the chickens were chasing you.

The chills were back in full force. I hadn't told anyone what my dream was, I barely could even remember at this point. Yet it was true, that was what I had dreamt about. This wasn't a prank or some ruse, this was real. There's no way anything could've predicted that. I quickly tried thinking of the best questions to ask. I could ask anything. Somehow in this moment I couldn't think of any good worthwhile questions. It was like I had a brain fart. I finally asked a question.

Are there aliens?

Yes.

For some reason I expected a detailed response. Not just a simple yes / no.

Are there humans on other planets in the universe?

No.

I decided to ask a question that wasn't just a simple yes or no response. 

What's the meaning of life?

To be happy.

This answer bugged me. The answer to life is being happy? What about the millions of people who are suffering in this very moment? The people in senseless wars or starving for food. How are they supposed to be happy exactly?

Why do humans suffer?

Suffering is a part of being human. If no one suffered, happiness wouldn't mean anything.

I was first shocked to see there was a two sentence response, and I was double shocked to see how much that made sense. If we didn't cry, feel sad, or anything.. we wouldn't appreciate the times when we're laughing, happy, etc. Still, I felt like some people suffer way more than they need to. 

A pop up showed up on the phone. "Low battery". I looked at the phone and realized it didn't have a single plugin. How the hell could I charge this phone? I realized I wouldn't have a phone that's going to answer my questions for the rest of my life. This is a one time opportunity. On the top right the phone said 7\% battery. I had about 10 or so minutes before the phone was dead. 

Are humans capable of time travel?

Time is a human concept, but no.

Is heaven real?

Yes.

Is hell real?

Yes.

Am I going to hell?

No.

If I kill myself will I go to hell?

No.

Didn't you say that killing yourself is a sin?

I never said that.

Are all the bibles & religions accurate?

Hardly.

How much percentage wise is accurate?

5%.

Will all atheists go to hell?

No. Hell is only for the evil.

Is being gay a sin?

No.

Is free will an illusion? Since you already know the fate of everyone.

It is not an illusion. Knowing what is going to happen does not mean you are controlling it.

I looked at the battery left, it was 4% now. I had little time left and I had to ask the most important questions I could possibly ask.

When year will the world end?

2073.

That was unexpected. I considered asking what year was I going to die, but I was afraid of the answer. 

Was Jesus Christ real?

Yes.

Why do you allow evil?

I allow free will.

Is the devil real?

Yes.

Is the devil on earth?

Yes.

Is the devil a human?

Yes.

Is the devil a politician?

No.

Is the antichrist on earth?

Not yet.

Are there other dimensions?

Yes. 

How many?

1,495,948,784,284,612,335.

I was now at 1% battery. I had one or two questions left and this phone was going to die. I thought of the countless questions I still had until I finally decided.

Why are we doing this?

To remind you that you are not superior to any other human. Do not look down on others and do not judge others. Your life began the moment you were born.

I stared at the phone for a few seconds, speechless, stunned.. and then the phone died. 

From that day on, I realized something. I had to enjoy life as much as I could. I always thought I was just in the warm up phase for my life, and the real thing hadn't even begun yet, but that's not true. We all get only one life. Even though my life was lonely and boring, it was still mine. I still had fun from time to time, and isn't that what really matters?
