Hello, to whomever may be reading this, my name is Michael, and i am dead, or, well at least i think i am, my last memory of being alive were the highbeams of a semi in the rain and a split second of some decently agonizing pain, hell, even as I'm writing this i can still feel my muscles aching a bit, but alas.  
  
As to how I'm writing to you, well, i don’t really know either, this machine just has a keyboard, a screen with a big textbox that i can write in with a green button that says SEND, a mouse and a power cord that leads out of the place I'm trapped in, and, right, almost didn’t mention that I'm trapped in some sort of… well let’s call it a house, even though it’s more of a room pretending to be a house, it’s as if you gave a very basic description to what the insides of a house look like to someone who's never been inside of one.   
All of the rooms are there, and i can recognize what they are meant to be, but, they’re just not really right, let me just give you a few examples, the door is more wide than it is tall (it’s locked, already tried it) , the table is missing all of its legs, the stove only has one burner with one setting, which i can only describe as flamethrower, and well, this PC, if you can even call it that.  
  
The past few days I've spent here are uneventful, it’s been mostly me getting surprised that things in this house that shouldn’t possibly work, like the inverted toilet (No I am NOT describing how you’re supposed to use this), do, in their own weird, twisted ways, like, you’d be appalled at how comfy it is inside a mattress, you should try it sometimes, just stick your mattress up in a vertical position and cut a hole through the top, slide in feet first and leave your head sticking out, you’ll sleep like a fucking baby.  
Right, i just had to leave for a moment to deal with the basement people, oh, fuck i didn’t mention those did i? yeah they’re just, there, i haven’t messed with them much, they’re well, how can i describe them, you know those white naked beasts from uncharted? Basically those but a little smaller and more human like, sometimes they just sit at the bottom of the stairs on the ground and whistle, or it’s more like they’re singing.  
  
I got used to them being there, and i figured out that whenever they do their little performance i gotta throw whatever food scraps i have down at them to make them stop, they haven’t really paid much mind to me other than that, letting me do whatever chores i need to do in the basement, though i haven't tried going down there when they are in they singing ‘state’, oh, right my food, well, that’s a completely different story, you remember how i mentioned the locked door? Apparently whoever can open it knows when I sleep, because I always wake up to a grocery bag filled with various food items like vegetables, meat, water and a random wildcard for the day. Yesterday it was cereal and today it was… some sort of gray mass packaged in translucent vacuum sealed plastic, i haven’t opened it yet, in fact, it’s sitting right next to the keyboard as i type, I'll crack it open and update you on anything i find out about it.  
  
  
Right, it’s been 30 minutes since i wrote that, and let me tell you, opening that bag was a massive mistake, i am NOT touching anything else that seems weird delivered to me, you can fucking count on it, so, here’s what happened: When i first opened that god-forsaken thing the worse smell i have ever laid my nose on filled the room, naturally not wanting it to completely stink up the only place i could exist in i did the only reasonable thing that i could do while fighting off the urge to vomit everywhere, i threw it in the basement, and listen, yes, i too feel bad about the dwellers but it was either me or them, and hey, maybe they couldn’t smell? I never recalled seeing any noses on them, and this was delivered to me with the rest of my food, so maybe it was even edible to them (I’m not trying that shit myself though you can count on that).  
  
That was yet another mistake, considering that i heard the dwellers tweak out like crackers on a sunday, screaming, running breaking stuff (My poor dryer being one of their innocent victims) and eventually, escaping up the stairs, slamming the door open and slamming it shut behind them. We exchanged some very, very long stares, and all i could say to them was “... My bad?” they didn’t really say much back, but i believe they understood, currently they are inside what i have dubbed as Basement 2.0 (it’s just the guest bedroom, but i can’t be bothered to change how I've been calling them the past week so deal with it.  
The basement is off limits for now, i cant even get close to the door without starting to gag, and pinching my nose won't help either, somehow when i try to breathe with my mouth i can TASTE it, and yes, it tastes like satan's rear end, so, i guess I'll have to wash my clothes in the shower from now on.  
  
Anyways, i think I’ll actually hit send now, in an hour or so the lights will go out, and i don't wanna be awake when the walls start whispering again.

Michael out.
