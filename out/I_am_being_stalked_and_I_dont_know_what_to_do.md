It is a nice summer day. The breeze is amazing, the smell of flowers grazed my nose, looking in the man made pond in my backyard, the trees and I mirrored back, the calm rippling water as the fish swam . . what a nice day for a hike I thought. I check the weather app too incase of any weather changes or weather alerts, my app said there was a 70% chance of light rain, which is fine with me, who doesn't love a little rain? The smell, and the feel.

I live in a area surrounded by trees and nature, it is honestly such a beautiful land for living, I know the area like the back of my hand we have a set of 2 trails, a shallow creek that leads you to a beautiful opening in the mountain tops, all tide off with a Do Not Trespass sign so the land is all for me and my family and the animals. Today I made my way to trail 1, trail 1 is about a 10 mile trail all around, it circles around a small neighborhood about 4 miles out. I am familiar with a lot of people around in this neighborhood considering I walk these trails almost every weekend. There is a nice man who lives in a small blue house with a garden in his front lawn. He always waves as I'm passing by while watering his flowers.

Before I started my hike I picked up a small backpack to take with me. In this backpack I have 3 water bottles, 2 granola bars and a small pocket knife. Starting the trail with a smile on my face I was excited! The weather is perfect. I can see and hear the birds, the squirrels scrambling up the trees shaking the leaves as I pass by, and the sound of the small animals rustling in the bushes trying to hide from me.

After a good 22 minutes into my hike I was 1 mile in, I stopped to take a sip of water and to take a short breather, I sat on the small stub that I pass by where a withered tree had used to stand but has now fallen due to a strong thunderstorm we had a few months back. While sitting I see a cute little bunny passing, how cute, how fluffy and fragile I thought, I cracked open my first water bottle with my teeth and fountained it into my mouth but that's when I heard it, a loud blood curdling scream come deep from within the woods the bunny now scared off and me standing up looking around pondered on the thought of what that might be, I can't think of any animals that live in these woods that could make such a sound.. I try to dismiss it as it may be a group of teens who found their way into the woods ignorantly ignoring the no trespassing sign.

Continuing with my hike I was now nearing the neighborhood with the crunch of gravel and leaves under my feet, what a satisfying sound, until it was interrupted with that ear bleeding screech again. God what the fuck could make that noise, It was louder this time. still trying to wrap my head around what that awful noise was I continue through the woods paranoid that's when the rain starts falling. I see something in the corner of my eye, a figure as fast as lightning launching itself through the woods too fast to see and too far gone to be identifiable. maybe it was a fox? Well if it wanted to hurt me it wouldn't be running away from me. . . . right?

AGAIN, that screaming sound, but this time it is near,  right behind me. It hurt. I slipped in the mud and fell to the ground as I held my ears covering them with my hands almost crying lying on the ground letting the rain hit my face. The pain.. FUCK! The pain! My ears now ringing due to that noise like shattering glass, I stood up glancing around even more paranoid than before I then took the time to look down at my hands . . blood. Blood everywhere. My ears are bleeding! and that's when I saw IT or . . well . . them in the corner of my eye, I looked up. Many figures stood in the distance behind trees watching me.

Tall, VERY tall, at least 9 feet each, lengthy and skinny, they are the color of a black void and their eyes . . I will never forget their eyes, they are pure white. Staring into them is giving me the most uncomforting unwelcoming feeling. It was like they want me gone, like they want me to get the fuck out. . as if this is THEIR woods and THEIR land. Their arms were long, nearly dragging the ground, their hands were claws . . sharp, oh so very sharp disgustingly long. One of them slowly started dragging their claws on the tree leaving a scratch mark and that awful screaming noise which I now know was coming from them and their unhinged mouths. One started tilting its head slowly while doing so its neck made a cracking sound. Oh. My. Fucking. God. it's neck ..  stretching and growing in length making a breaking and snapping sound as it's getting longer and taller.

I had no plans to stay and try to make friends with these ungodly fucking creatures, I just want to get the fuck out. I started to run, I didn't look back. I heard the leaves and plants getting mauled through behind me as if something was chasing me. "don't look back." "don't look back!" I repeat to myself, but I'm curious and a idiot, letting my curiosity get the best of me I turned around for a split second and that's when I saw 6 giant beastly creatures charging at me like a wolf pack chasing a small bunny, their claws digging into the dirt launching themselves forwards to get close to me. One of them hooked my shoulder with their claws dragging me down to the ground, I hit my head so hard onto the rock below me I blacked out for a second. While having wip-lash and my instinct for survival I remembered my pocket knife. shit. I forgot my backpack. I look back up and a giant creature pinning me down slowly moving in towards my face with its unhinged jaw drooling over me letting it's awful horrid breath that smells like roadkill fill my nose, this is it I know this is about to be my end, it is about to sink its teeth into me.

At this point i’d do anything to just survive. I am not about to be this things dinner, I bent my knees into my chest and kicked the creature in the stomach, during the creatures confusion and vulnerability it loosened its grip of me and I managed to get one of my arms free I started to jab it in the sides with my fists and started to scratch at its eyes, it shreeked in pain and let go of me. I scrambled up and bolted back through the woods finally making it to the small neighborhood.

I ran upto the old man gardening and begged him to help me, he hurried me inside, caterered my wounds, and let me rest in his basement on his couch. When I was feeling a little better I explained everything that had happened to him and he looked at me in horror. “i’m gonna be sick” he said holding his mouth running to the kitchen sink. I hurried over to him asking what the fuck was going on he then said to me “you saw a wendigo you’re lucky to have even made it out of its grasp.”

I’m now writing this 1 year into the future and I still hear those awful screaming noises from deep within the forest, every now and then I still feel like im being watched.
