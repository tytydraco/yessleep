  
Have you ever found your mind racing with the thought that the whole world had been pervaded by madness, and you were the only one holding onto to some semblance of common sense?  
  
No? Lucky you. That very sentiment was a permanent resident in my head now. Roaming rent-free and unfettered, always picking the most inappropriate moments to surface from one of the snug brain recesses it claimed as home. For all I knew, having machete-wielding lunatics eager to marry your back off to their beloved blade should encourage your brain to formulate escape routes and countermeasures, not going into philosopher mode, contemplating life and hollering about how and what and why. The same applied to trying not to pull unwanted attraction to your presence as you’re pressing your whole body into a ball inside a random wardrobe while ravenous creatures rummaged through the room, or trying to still erratic breathing hiding from infuriated wraiths.  
  
They might seem unrelated, but all three of them had weaved their ways into my life, my world, each falling under expanding categories of the unholiness that I had been encountered, are currently toiling away from, or would someday be subject to. This harrowing routine repeated on a basis regular enough to erase the unwillingness and self-denial from me. Between giving up vain wishes and giving up limbs, viscera, or the right to live, the sensible option should be obvious.  
  
But the fear factors that slithered down my spine and juggled my inside all the way up the base of my throat always started afresh. Dread and fear were primal emotions, thereby controlling them or governing the body to purge them would be to no avail. Any threat of harm would automatically trigger them, a biological alert for potential hazards in the immediate areas.    
  
And let me tell you, nothing could be a stronger catalyst than being held against a cold tiled wall by an unrealistically colossal force, my back flowering into crimson ribbons, shredded skin and flesh snarling up into painful clumps as blood gushed out from the lacerations to pool at my feet. The bodily response to danger squeezed my chest, the frantic pounding of my heart within my ribcage thundered through my veins, tension coursed into my blood, flesh, bone, and marrow in relentless rivulets. The repugnant breath that reeked of plaque buildup and a meat-only diet, followed by the grin of crooked, misaligned teeth and the equally disorganized facial features only fueled its growth.  
  
My apology, perhaps I should fast forward and begin where the whole ordeal had yet to unfold so you can grasp the picture. I couldn’t trace all the way back to the very first day, unfortunately, since I myself had a hard time swimming against the memory tides to find the one that initiated the rest. There’s too many to keep count and keep track of. But I could divulge to you the gory (literally) details of what I’m thrown into this time, to grant you a peek into the genuine definition of madness.  
  
My morning started the same as any of the weekdays that had come and passed. I woke up to the shrill blaring alarm, rubbed all the grogginess from my eyelids, before changing out of the sleepwear into a more proper outfit for work.  All the dresses and nice-looking garbs were either cascading down from hangers or tucked in well organized stacks at the far left end of the wardrobe, and practical clothing items that suited rigorous activities made up the vast storage space to the right.  
  
I reached into the wardrobe for the apparels with my dominant hand. Today’s outfit consisted of a basic black T-shirt - light, long sleeves and made entirely from polyester for that moisture-wicking effect, a pair of sturdy and flexible nylon pants that wouldn’t restrict any movements while withstanding all the possible impacts, and a jacket - not entirely an essential part of the getup, but nevertheless recommendable. It would prove helpful in providing extra warmth, or a makeshift door latch, or even a temporary weapon if powered by sufficient strength and a swift swing in times of desperation.  
  
Which were, technically, most of the time.  
  
I wove my long black hair into a bun, wrapping it in a circular motion at the back of my head until reaching the right level of tightness to ensure that no strand would come loose. No hair ornament, only a basic elastic band and some bobby pins to keep the coils of tresses neatly tucked where they should be. Accessories easily got caught in the surroundings, and when every second mattered, stopping to shake them off could spell your demise.  
  
I didn’t mull over the helpful items to bag along. Food or objects capable of heavy damage would be stripped off the second I’m stepping through The Gate anyway. Only special tools and implements purchased directly from The Department Store were approved - but this is a story for another occasion, as it would be rather long.  
  
It’s all set.  
  
My eyes drifted to the bed, and as I had guessed, the red envelope had arrived. It nestled innocently between the stacked pillows, only a corner slightly peeking out, the rest buried by all the creases and folds of fabric. As though it had been there right from the start. I never knew who the sender could be, I tried a couple times, but that eerie letter seemed to manifest out of thin air. I blinked, and it was there, the bright crimson an omen of dread.  
  
I picked it up. The paper felt too smooth and strangely elastic to be a product of fibers and plants. It wouldn’t be wrong to call it an extension of my fingers by sensation alone honestly. I took a deep breath, bracing myself for the content as I peeled the seal off and looked at the writing inside.  
  
**Pacific Supermarket**

I will offer some explanations to clear the confusion in the next update (if I was alive in the end, of course). Basically, adhering to the rules limited the risks of having your head rolling down your feet, and Fluid was the only currency the Department Store recognized and accepted - in short, getting as much as possible helped to ensure the quality of one’s life here.  
  
Amassing Fluid was also rumored to be a good way to boost survival rate, considering the extraordinary products found at the Store.  
  
But seriously, that’s just over-marketing. Armed or not, all were equally food to the force behind the Gate - well, at the very least they had high respect for equality, I’ll give them credit for that.  
  
Pacific Supermarket was a 10 minute walk from my house. I never shopped there nevertheless. The Department Store was the only location where regular commodities for humans could be found now. And don’t ask me why I knew; I valued my own mental health and had no intention of digging up that part of memories.  
  
The sky was a deep vermilion, as always, the essence of madness and evil overlapping and bleeding into that sickening hue. I thought it seemed darker than yesterday, but I couldn’t spare a glance to confirm. The malice born from that sickening spread of red would drive one to insanity.  
  
Like the pedestrians around me.  
  
They went about their life, as though the nightmarish anomalies that corrupted heaven and spilled down onto our plane were my delusions. But their eyes reflected nothing, void of all human emotions. That eerie emptiness leaked into their visage their gait, posture, gesture - erasing even the smallest human essence that could be perceived. It was as if every bit of their soul had been drained, leaving behind hollow shells for an invisible puppeteer to toy with.  
  
If the world behind the Gate claimed me, I too would be a part of their mindless wandering…  
  
I was the last person to reach the supermarket, and was immediately taken aback by the intense argument between the people who were already there. Sounds of all levels clashed among themselves until the cacophony turned unintelligible, but I managed to catch the enraged exclamation of a middle-aged man, who kept on demanding for ‘this stupid farce’ to be ended, and that he had an important meeting awaiting him. Fighting the urge to wince, I scanned the group, only to discover two young girls cowering next to each other, a fearful expression contorting their features - proves that none of them had ever been inside the Gate before.  
  
My brows furrowed, and this time I didn’t bother to stop them. How could it be? Newcomers weren’t an uncommon sight, but they weren’t supposed to be assigned to a world of high difficulty and high rewards. And there were three in total?  
  
I didn’t find any familiar faces among the experienced - apparently, my questions would be left hanging. Most participants didn’t view random strangers in a positive light, some would even treat all but them and their allies as nemesis. It’s only natural, I supposed. The world behind the Gate was misshapen and distorted by madness and violence, we all wanted to break free from it at any cost.  
  
More often than not, the supernaturals weren’t the sole threat there.  
  
“I’m done with your shit. I’m going home, and none of you fuckers are going to stop me or I swear to God I’ll cave your face in!” The man from earlier was still roaring on top of his lungs, and except for the other newcomers, the rest of the group had start eyeing him the way they would a dead body. The waves of contempt sent his way seemed to have washed away his last shreds of rationality, indignation and resentment taking over his face, blowing through his nostrils and sending them flaring. He ground his teeth and stomped away, followed suit by the two shivering girls who were still clutching each other.  
  
“It’s not safe to leave.” Having no other option, I decided to speak up: “I understand your confusion and fear, but this is not a TV Show or a prank. It’s not possible to have the whole city partaking in one anyway, and even if it is, the people are not professional actors, they couldn’t maintain their robot-like performance for an extended period without signs of fatigue or mistakes. Did you notice any of that?”  
  
My words managed to get through to the girls, and I saw them hesitantly stop to inspect the people with wary eyes. But the man kept marching on, not bothering to glance back.  
  
“More importantly, we couldn’t slip in your house at night to place that red envelope on your bed, then compel your entire family to act like mindless drones without waking you up. Think about it. Did you hear anything? Find anything unusual? How could we even make it through your locked doors in the first place? Because none of us looked paper-thin enough to slither through the window bars to me.”  
  
The two girls stiffened, frozen in their spot. An internal debate obviously raced through their head, and eventually, they backtracked and rejoined the group. Traces of reluctance lingered in the way their teeth sank into their lips and the doubt flashing across their eyes. But this was enough, I didn’t plan for more than bringing them back.  
  
I called the man back, but he responded by some not-so-friendly terms. Well, that was the end of my kindness. I wouldn’t sacrifice my own strength to drag a struggling adamant old man back at the expense of my own safety behind the Gate.  
  
“Come on, let’s enter. Nothing good to see here.” I turned on the ball of my feet and proceeded to the supermarket’s entry.  
The automatic door slid open, and where there should be aisles of products and chatting employees an endless void of darkness. Nothing could be detected in its depth, no sound, no hint of movement, absolutely nothing. I couldn’t even see a single tile lining the floor, or the faint flickering of the ceiling fluorescent light. Perhaps an hungry pair of eyes were watching us in silence amid the stale blackness, deciding on the first meals to slide down a broad mouth of needle-sharp teeth? Perhaps where I couldn’t see, a contorted humanoid was dragging itself across the vast space on gnarly limbs, its blackened smile stretching straight to the ears, and its ravenous eyes were locking on me? Perhaps both were standing on the other side of the darkness, waiting for their prey to arrive…  
  
I took a deep breath, rearranging my jumbled thoughts. As expected, the Gate was a master of weaving fear into the heart of humans and tying the knot to lock it there. I couldn’t afford to lose focus and fall into its trap. This darkness was simply an intermediate zone between this world and the realm beyond, it’s safe.  
  
“We need to cross before it’s too late.” I announced the others, placing one foot through the threshold.  
  
I didn’t flinch as a series of screams suddenly rippled through the streets behind me, terror and pain seeping deep into those desperate sounds. That middle-aged man mustn’t have got any further than three feet away from the designated assembly area. Onlookers were enamored with the defiants, they were always waiting for the chance to embrace those refusing to play by the rules in their arms.  
  
I glanced back, and right before my very eyes was a scene that could rival Hell. The citizens had swarmed over their latest prize. The dullness had not left their wide eyes, but their lips had stretched up to the highest point of their cheek bones in a twisted, unnatural grin. Humans should not be capable of that expression: An all-out smile would require the muscles around the eyes to contract, slightly closing the lids in return. These people’s eyes were the opposite, they were wide, empty, completely out of place with the spread of teeth on the lower part of their face.  
  
And they were tearing the man apart, little by little, chunk by chunk.  
  
While making absolutely no sounds.  
  
The silence of the crowd heightened the shrill screams that continued echoing throughout the streets, accompanied by the shuddering tearing of skin, then flesh, then tendon, then bones. The overwhelming smell of blood wafted over, and some people of the group had begun to retch. I could tell the slight differences between the noise that body parts made when they were expunged by force. They should have clawed through his intestines and emptied his abdomen by now…  
  
Oh wait… They were tossing the extracted intestines in the air, loops after loops. That excessive length was unmistakable…  
  
More organs and body parts littered the ground, but the gushing blood made it hard to identify them.  
  
The force of the throwing and the ripping intensified, portions of torn flesh swiveling through the air and hitting the front of the supermarket, bringing a small shower of blood along. I shook my head and turned away from the sickening feast as the painful screams of the man died out.  
  
We had yet to enter the Gate, and our number had already been reduced to 11.  
  
He should have heeded my warning…
