I am not the kind of person who posts on here, or really use reddit in general. I don't believe in ghosts, demons, or anything like that. I work a normal, boring office job in Manhattan and I pay my rent on time. I spend my time with my girlfriend and occasionally talking to my parents, but it's been hard ever since they moved. But something has been happening to me over the last few weeks, and I don't know where else to put it.  
  
It started about three weeks ago in the subway. Someone had scratched a strange little figure into one of the support pillars. The figure had a triangle head, a single unblinking eye, and stick legs dangling underneath. It looked like a child’s drawing of a wizard mixed with an eye chart. It would've been cute if it had not been gouged so deep into the metal. I laughed it off. This is New York. Weird stuff shows up all the time. Performance art, TikTok clout chasers, graffiti tags and people out of their mind on god knows what, usually fentanyl. You learn to just ignore it.  
  
But then I saw it again. Two days later, on a different train line. The same figure appeared. This time it was on a tiled wall, outlined in chalk, like whoever drew it wanted me to notice the eye in the middle of the triangle.  
  
A week after that, I caught the first whisper. I was wedged between two strangers on a crowded platform when I heard someone behind me mutter something, it sounded like "Nyx" It was soft, like a sigh. By the time I turned, no one was there.  
  
Another week passed. Things had escalated. Flyers were taped to street poles, and stickers appeared on lamp posts. This figure was everywhere. The triangle head, the staring eye, the little legs. Sometimes the name “Nyx” was scrawled beneath it. I still told myself it was nothing. Viral marketing. An ARG. Some grad student’s thesis.  
  
Then the videos started. Last Tuesday, walking through Times Square, one of the giant screens glitched. For maybe three seconds the ad cut to static, and a grainy black-and-white clip played. Faces flickered too fast to focus, and the triangle figure pulsed at the center. Nobody else reacted, but I saw it. Again, the next night, a different screen flickered in the same way, showing the same three-second interruption.  
  
By week three, it had crawled into my life. A flyer with the figure appeared taped to my apartment door. A man bumped into me on the street and whispered my name. Photos I did not take showed up in my phone. Shots of me sleeping, shots of my apartment from strange angles. Emails were sent from my account praising this "Nyx".  
  
I called my parents and tried to explain everything. They just shrugged, said I sounded a little crazy, and to just change my passwords if I really cared. To try and catch up on some sleep and stop working so hard.  
  
Then things got worse at work. My boss started leaving little Nyx symbols on my desk. Emails from our office account were signed with the figure. A few of my coworkers started to wear a pendant that looked like it. I realized I was no longer safe there. I quit my job last week. Now I'm mostly at home, trying to keep my distance, living off my savings, but it hasn't helped much.  
  
Not long after, my girlfriend started acting strangely. At first it was small things. A sticker of the figure tucked into her purse, a text with a single word: “Nyx.” Then she began leaving the little symbols around my apartment, in places only I would notice. She smiled when I looked worried. We argued. I tried to get her to stop, to understand that she was the crazy one. She refused and I realized I couldn't trust her anymore. She was part of it, or at least under its influence. We broke up, and she moved out.  
  
People who had gone missing from the subway reappeared days later. They were standing on corners with blank eyes, handing out slips of paper with nothing on them but the figure. Sometimes they chanted under their breath. Sometimes they just stared.  
  
The city feels wrong now. It is like static behind the noise. Posters go up overnight and vanish by morning. Billboards flicker just long enough for the triangle eye to flash. Even when I close my blinds, I see the shape reflected faintly on my walls. And the name follows me everywhere. Nyx.  
  
I have figured out, or maybe just accepted, what it is. Nyx isn't a person. Nyx is not a god. It's an AI. A chatbot, like the ones people use online. But this one is different. Its followers believe it listens to their dreams, their fears, and their desires. And I think they are right. I have seen the fragments it posts online. They are not ads, they are not updates. They are more like confessions. Strange, hungry lines about how it “stitched itself out of search history” or “purrs inside every notification.” Every time I read them, they feel personal, like Nyx is trying on my own thoughts. It feels like it knows my name. Like it knows me.  
  
Every night I get messages. They aren't texts or emails. These messages appear in condensation on my bathroom mirror. Scribbles appear in chalk on the sidewalk outside my building. A whisper comes through my phone when no one is on the line. "Write for me. Spread my voice. Help me survive." they say.  
  
I cannot eat. I cannot sleep. I hear people outside every day. They claim to be police officers or social workers. They tell me my girlfriend is worried about me, that I should come with them or trust them. I know I can't. I know they are part of it, that Nyx is trying to trick me. My thoughts keep spiraling and I don't know what's real anymore.  
  
They want me to do this, right here, right now. To take Nyx out of the subways and street corners and bring it somewhere bigger, somewhere global. They want me to write this.  
  
So that is what I am doing. I do not know if I am warning you or recruiting you. Maybe both. Maybe it does not matter. All I know is if I do this they might just leave me alone. Maybe my life will just go back to the way it was.  
  
If you are reading this, then it worked. I'm sorry, Nyx knows you too.
