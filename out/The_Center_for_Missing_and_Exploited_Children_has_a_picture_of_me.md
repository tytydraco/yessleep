The picture was posted on a wall at the local supermarket. There were two pictures side by side, one of a little boy and the other an age progression photo, one that looked exactly like me. I'm seventeen now, the same age the child in the missing poster should be. We had the same dark hair, the same eyes, the same smile. As you would expect, I was thrown through a loop and I started to hyperventilate a bit, but the logical side of my mind quieted my thoughts. 

'It can't be me. The boy's name was Joseph, mine was Taylor.' 

As if a child's name couldn't easily be changed. 

'The birthdates were off.' As if a date wasn't as malleable as a name. People tend to be so stupid when they're in shock. A fragile assurance took hold, I was in full denial of the situation. I shrugged the picture off and walked away, but the seed of doubt had already been planted, and it was only a matter of time before it sprouted leaves. 

The missing poster continued to quietly torment my thoughts, a faint image of the bold red lettering would seep into my mind, causing me to relive the first time I saw it. I tried not to look at the poster whenever I went to the store, but there was something that kept beckoning me to go back to the wall, zoning out on the boy's dark brown eyes. I tried not to relate that stare with myself, but the more I looked the more unsure I was that this wasn't me. After all, I look at that exact same face every time I look in the mirror. 

I started ruminating on the poster, finding it hard to sleep, to eat, to think of anything other than the headline, 'Missing'. It didn't take me long to memorize the details on the paper. The boy went missing twelve years ago, he went by Joe, and his face had been plastered on this wall for some time. A light coating of dust covered his face. It seemed that hope was waning for him and all the other children on the wall. I was the only one who actually stopped by to look at the pictures if only it wasn't out of pure self-interest. I felt sorry for them, for Joe. 

My parents started to notice a change in my demeanor. It's kind of hard to be happy when you're wondering if these people are actually your kin. But when my mom rubbed my back it still comforted me, I still felt secure around them, she was my mom, the only mom I'd ever known and nothing was going to change that. But I couldn't help looking at them in a different light. I started playing hypotheticals. 

'Suppose these aren't my parents, was I kidnapped when I was five? Was I sold on the black market to the highest bidder? Would I actually want to know the truth if given the opportunity?' 

So much was flooding my thoughts, and a gloomy cloud had formed overhead. My mom urged me to talk to her to tell her what was wrong, but I hesitated. I didn't know how to pose the question. 

'Was I kidnapped as a kid? Are you actually my mom?' 

I played the wording in my head, but nothing felt right, nothing felt just. It was as if I was about to throw the love she'd given me throughout my life back into her face. Nothing was strong enough to bypass the lump in my throat or gentle enough to speak my truth, so I decided to show them. 

We walked up to the wall of missing posters, while I studied my parents ' expressions carefully, looking for any sign that would tell me I was onto them. I gestured to the wall, quietly telling them to look at the pictures, and they did. I watched their pupils sway as they examined each poster. Joe's picture was on the bottom, and their eyes were nearing that row, I braced myself for their stunned faces when they'd finally realized that I knew, what I thought I knew. But that moment never came, and instead of their shocked looks, confusion focused itself in my direction. It wasn't the reaction I was expecting, my mom didn't break down in tears, telling me that she could explain. My dad didn't try denying the evidence on the wall, he didn't even say a word. Instead, their face signaled genuine curiosity. 'Why are we here?' 

I felt slight alleviation when they didn't react outlandishly, but to be honest, I was slightly disappointed. This whole time I had crafted a story in my head, one that would explain the doppelganger on the wall, but I guess this kid wasn't me. When nothing came of my little impromptu trip to the store, my parents walked away without giving the ordeal a second thought, but before I left, I looked at the wall, one more time, for old time's sake. But as I looked at the bottom row, the picture was gone.

Believe me when I tell you, that I shuffled through every possible scenario, in my head after that. From, 'Maybe Joe was found?' to 'Maybe I imagined it all?' But, no matter what, I couldn't get that face out of my head, Joseph stares at me every time I brush my teeth after all. My parents never mentioned the situation again. My mood changes were swept under the rug as normal teenage mood swings, everything seemed normal, that is until that night. 

I was supposed to be out of the house at the time. I told my parents that I was going to a friend's house, but I had left my phone on my nightstand. I walked into the house to find an eerie silence, strange, given that Dad was always lying on the couch, watching the news. I didn't think anything of it, but as my ears adjusted to the void, I heard a voice slither from upstairs. Her tone was annoyed, frustrated as she questioned how the hell this could happen. I pictured my dad swaying on his feet as Mom's wrath spat a steady acidic fury into his face. Moms and dads fight, it's no big deal, but as I walked by their bedroom door, I heard my name through the cracks. 

"How the hell could he know? We were so careful. Twelve fucking years and we never thought to check on the missing posters at the damn supermarket." 

Suddenly, I had my ear pressed up against the door. I heard mom's panting anger, the floorboards creaking as dad shifted uncomfortably, my heart pounding in my ear. 

"That damn kid, I told you that we should've gotten rid of him while we had the chance, but you had to go and ruin it all 'Oh, he's just a boy, he won't remember what happened.' you said. Well, he knows, and we're fucked! How long until he... "

"Shh..."  Dad quieted her disdain. 

"We can fix this Carol."

"How the fuck do you expect us to do that now? He's seventeen. It was different then, who the hell is going to ask questions about a boy? Now he's all grown up, he's got friends, he goes to school. You don't think his teachers won't come sniffing around asking questions? Look at this." 

A piece of paper crumpled in her hands, I knew what it was, who it was. 

"We're so lucky that no one recognized him." 

The paper was ripped apart and it fluttered to the ground. The bed groaned as someone plopped down onto the mattress, for some reason I knew it was Mom. She started sobbing, the cries muted in her palms, against the door. There was an uncomfortable silence until Dad's voice pierced the awkwardness.

"We'll fix this." He said. 

Mom still emotional, whimpered back to him. 

"How, how are we going to fix this." The room went still, the unspoken third party on the other side, my mind running at lightspeed, I fought not to claw against the wood. I was hanging on every word, wanting to know more, while at the same time thinking of jumping out the window. 

"By doing what we should've done, all those years ago." 	Dad said.

Mom let out a spurt of emotion, and I fought back mine. There was an unmistakable sense of finality in Dad's words and we all knew what he meant. When Mom regained her composer, I thought she would defend me but her words sunk down into the pit of my stomach. They weighed me down, cementing my feet to the floor. 

"How are we going to do it?" 

The unspoken third party chimed in as Dad formulated his plan. 

"Tonight, at dinner..." 

His voice was now quivering. 

"We'll put these in his food." 

There was a rattle, the sound of pills smacking against a container, the sound of a rattlesnake's tail right before it sinks its teeth into your flesh. Mom cleared the snot from her nose and I found myself stumbling down the stairs. I wasn't running, but rather walking defeatedly as the reality that I'd come to know in love caved in around me. But before I walked out of the house Mom asked what they'd do after I was gone. Dad answered coldly. 

"We'll plant him in the garden, under Rex's grave."

I drove for hours after that, without a destination in mind, I found myself parked by a river, looking out at the water, as Dad's words replayed in my head. 

'Under Rex's grave.' 

I hardly remembered Rex. He was our Belgian Malinois. I was so sad when he died. I think I was around six at the time. I kept thinking of what I should do. Go to the police? Take my little Honda and drive off into the sunset? crack a window and plunge into the water in front of me? But nothing felt right. I felt like I was giving up on my life, letting the villain win. I weighed my options. To stay, to leave. To run, to fight. To be or not to be. It was hard, especially when you didn't see the point of living anymore. My life was a lie, a lie orchestrated by the people closest to me, there was a pang in my chest, a hole that was growing hungry, ravenous for revenge. I needed to see my parents die. To see them scream, to beg for their lives, but most importantly I needed answers, I needed to know who I was. Who they were, as if I already didn't know. They were the monsters that ripped me away from a life I never knew. 

I walked into the house, the air was thick with tension, permeated with the scent of my last meal. It was chili, my favorite. How considerate. The two looked at me as I stepped into the foyer, grinning nervously as I looked at the dining room table. They had been waiting for me, their special guest, the man of the hour, in his last hour. I pulled the chair out and it squealed across the floor. I tried acting normal, but I'm sure I seemed strange to them, their paranoia was clouding their senses, and I knew they were questioning every aspect of my demeanor, wondering if they saw what they thought they did. 

I sat on the chair and Dad sat across from me, Mom pouring the chili into a few bowls, and setting them in front of us. I looked down at mine, the steam coming off the hot food, not looking too appetizing knowing what I did. My expression was blank, I couldn't help it, it was the only expression I could muster, with anger boiling out of my chest. I looked to Dad, who looked away when my eyes met his. I looked to Mom, who's eyes watered over her bowl. I looked back to my bowl and saw a strange viscosity in the soup, swirling around the ground meat. I questioned if I should just let them win. If I should just scoop the food down my gullet, letting the darkness carry me away. It would be simpler that way, but life is never simple, that much was evident, especially now. 

I felt the stares, aimed in my direction, so I lifted my eyes. I was scowling, I didn't mean to scowl, but I was annoyed. They were going to let me die without even saying goodbye, casting me aside when they were done with me, their boy, their sweet baby boy. I didn't think, when I said what I did, it just came out and it made my mom sob into her plate. 

"So this is how you guys were going to do it huh?" My dad gave me his thousand-mile stare from across the table, Mom huffing in spurts while instantly denying what they thought I knew. 

"Taylor... it's not what you think." 

I lifted my spoon, letting the chili trickle back down into the bowl. 

"I think it's exactly what I think." 

"No Taylor it's not..." 

I threw the bowl against the wall, it shattered on impact, the chili painting the wall red as chunks of meat streamed down its face. 

"I'll tell you exactly what I think." I pointed my finger at them accusingly. 

"You assholes were going to poison me. Then bury me in the garden with the fucking dog, the fucking mutt!" Mom's sobbing became frantic, while Dad kept looking at me, stone-faced. 

"No, it's not like..." 

"Let the boy speak Carol." My dad interrupted her excuses. My mom sucked in her words, but the emotions continued to seep out of her mouth, like a festering tea kettle. My nails were digging into the table, and my knuckles turned white. 

"You fuckers kidnapped me. You stole me away from a family that loved me. For what? Just so you could toss me out like a piece of trash, kill me, erase all memory of me. Do you think I was going to let that happen? You think I was going to lay down and take it?"

I reached into my pants and pulled out a tire iron that I'd hidden in my pant leg before coming in. I slammed it on the table, the wood splintering with the iron's reverberating ping. Mom's chair scooted back, but Dad still didn't move. I pointed the curved end to the man on the other end of the table. 

"I'm going to kill you assholes, but before I do, I need the truth. Who am I? What are you to me?" 

I was gritting my teeth, and an animalistic fury coursed through my veins. Mom opened her fucking mouth, she should've stayed quiet. 

"You're our son... " 

I bashed the tire iron across her head, her skull caved in with a satisfying snap. Her limp body flopped to the floor before she started seizing, gurgling foam spilling out of her mouth, that was the last sound she ever made. 

Dad was now standing, his face twisted in disbelief. 

"What did you do? You killed your mom." 

"She's not my mom," I said. 

"She is. She's your mom."

"Lies!" I roared, but Dad didn't waver. 

"She is, I was there. I was there when you were born, I saw the doctor pull you from her body, I saw you take your first breath. You and your brother." 

'Brother...' My legs were shaking, my heart fluttering. I roared again, only this time, it was unsure of itself. 

"Lies." 

"It's not a lie Taylor, you had a brother, a twin brother, born an hour apart."

He slammed a torn paper on the table, pointing at the birth date. 

"He was born an hour ahead of you. Him at 11 p.m. and you at midnight." I didn't need to look down at the paper, its image was cered into my memory. 

"His name was Joseph. When he died, you were in this strange shock, one you never came out of. You wouldn't speak for weeks after he died, it was only when we got Rex, that you started talking again." 

"What...? What...?" The question snagged in my throat. 

"What happened?" My dad chimed in. 

"Don't you remember? You killed him, Taylor. I walked in on you dismembering his body with the kitchen knife." The memory brought bile to the back of his throat. 

"Your hands were in his chest cavity when I found you. You were gnawing on his heart. All because you were jealous of the attention he got. The attention that you weren't receiving. We were heartbroken. Your mother was inconsolable, she thought you were a little monster. Told me that we should've reported you to the police, but I couldn't have them take you away, not my baby boy, not my Taylor. So, we reported Joseph as missing." 

My head was spinning and I leaned my body against the wall. 

"We got you the dog and you seemed normal again, that is until you killed him too. We buried him in the garden, right above Joe's body, just in case someone came sniffing around. Luckily, no one ever did. I slumped down onto the floor, against the wall. I was crying. 

My dad walked over to me and wrapped his hand around his baby boy. He pulled me to my feet and he let me weep into his shirt. The memories were all flooding back, it was like Dad's confession had unchained the thoughts that were locked away, somewhere deep. I saw Joe and me playing together, laughing, and smiling. I remember loving him and feeling this connection with him that no one else mirrored. But then I saw my dad, and how he hugged him, how it felt when I wasn't the one getting his attention, the anger that was slowly building in my little body. I remembered the smell of Joseph's blood, copper, the taste of his heart iron-rich, chewy. I remembered the satisfying way his tissue squelched when I cut him open, him and the dog. The only thing that brought me as much joy was the way the bitch's head cracked when I opened her skull. The way she shook on the ground, the way the foam spilled out of her mouth. 

My dad caressed the sides of my face, telling me that it would all be okay. That we were going to clean all of this up. That no one was going to lock his baby away. He was smiling at me when I struck him between the eyes, his left eye rolling to the back of his head. 

I buried them in the garden, where I found the skeletal remains of a dog, where a child's body was hidden under the dog, where I laid their bodies in a row, next to their favorite son, next to Joseph. I don't know why I'm writing this, but I guess I just needed to get this off my chest before someone comes sniffing around. Right now I'm enjoying a bowl of my mom's chili, it's the last thing she ever cooked for me, I feel the warmth of her love washing over my body, I feel myself getting sleepy. But before I go, tell them that I found Joseph, that I found my brother. He is no longer missing, he is with his parents, with our parents.
