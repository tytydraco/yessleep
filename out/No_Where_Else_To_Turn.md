I recently moved into a new apartment, and everything seemed perfect at first. The place was spacious, the rent was affordable, and the neighborhood was quiet. But one night, I woke up to what sounded like whispering coming from the empty room next to mine. I checked the room but saw nothing, so I brushed it off as my imagination, but the whispers persisted every night, growing louder and more insistent.

At first I tried to ignore it, but the whispers began to affect my sleep. I found myself tossing and turning, unable to shake the feeling of being watched. It settled over me like a heavy blanket. The whispers seemed to be calling out to me, pleading for something I couldn't quite make out.

One evening, I decided to investigate fully. Suddenly, as I approached the room, the whispers turned into frantic pleas for help. I hesitated with my hand hovering over the handle, but my curiosity got the better of me, and I slowly opened the door. To my suprise, the room was completely empty, but then an almighty scream erupted from the closet.

I stood frozen in the doorway, my heart pounding in my chest. The pleas for help grew louder, more desperate. I couldn't ignore them any longer. With trembling hands, I reached for the closet door and flung it open.

The whispers stopped abruptly, and the room fell silent. Inside the closet, I found nothing but an old, dusty mirror. As I stared at my reflection, I noticed something chilling â€“ my reflection wasn't mimicking my movements. It was smiling at me, but nothing else.

I stumbled back, my breath catching in my throat. The figure in the mirror remained still, its smile widening as if it knew the fear it was causing me. I quickly slammed the closet door shut before anything else could happen and ran out of the apartment.

After staying with a few friends over the course of a couple of weeks, it was evident that it wasn't just that one mirror, or that it was my house, because it didn't matter what mirror I looked in, I saw the same, *thing,* looking back at me. So, I moved back home.

No one else is seeing what I'm seeing, but I'm most certainly not crazy, so please don't call me that. I can't look into mirrors anymore, but I also can't shake the feeling that whatever is in the mirrors, is still watching me. Sometimes, late at night, I catch a glimpse of a sinister smile in the reflection of a window or a polished surface, but I'm just too terrified to look. I haven't slept in weeks.

Please, someone help me. What are my options here?

I've tried smashing the mirrors or surfaces when I see them... nothing. I've tried leaving...doesn't matter. I've even tried a spell a witch gave me... I got laughed at by, *it.*

Please... It's whispering again and I can't stand it... I have no where else to turn.
