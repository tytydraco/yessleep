This happened about 4 months ago. Im a plus sized woman in my 30s. I would say that my weight is genetic. Everyone in my family is bigger and I haven’t been under 200lbs since middle school. I’m well past the age that all of my friends got married and settled, but dating has been difficult for me, so I decided it was time to be proactive and lose the weight. 

It all started with an office New Year’s party. My boss decided that instead of having a bar we’d do some festive activities. One of them was to write down our New Year’s resolution to be burned in the bonfire she was going to have her husband build out back. Something about the ash releasing into the air and carrying our manifestation into the universe. She’s different, but what else can you expect from someone throwing a parking lot bonfire. 

The party was dying down by the time they lit the bonfire, but I didn’t have anything else going on for the night so I decided to stay a little while longer. My boss passed out post it notes and pencils. When I was ready to leave I scribbled down my resolution, tossed it into the fire, and started off to my car. My coworker Karen stopped me just before I opened my door to chat. She asked me if I was ready to be back in the office from our holiday break, if I had a good Christmas, and other things like that. We chatted about 10 minutes before she asked me what my New Year’s resolution was. I told her I hoped to lose some weight and she gave me the number of her personal trainer. 

For a couple of weeks I debated the idea of using a personal trainer. It would be pricey but I knew I needed someone to hold me accountable. I decided to shoot the guy a text and see if he had any sessions available before or after I would need to be at work. He texted me back before I could even put my phone down. I just assumed that he had been on his phone when I sent the message, but knowing what I know now it feels like more than a coincidence. He told me that he would be able to meet with me that same day at 5 o clock, so after work I went back to my apartment to change and met him at the gym he worked in. 

My first impression was that he was a very nice guy, and as much as I hate to admit it now, he was incredibly attractive. Obviously toned, on the taller side, dressed in expensive brand clothing, and well groomed. He made me feel confident that I was going to be able to lose the weight and didn’t make me feel bad about my size. He even commented about what areas he thought I should focus on so I didn’t completely lose my “sexy curves”. Definitely inappropriate but as good looking as he was it made me blush a bit. He made a few other comments throughout the session but nothing that made me feel truly uncomfortable. The next day at work when I asked Karen about it she said he hadn’t ever made comments like that to her but that she was old enough to be his grandmother so it didn’t surprise her. 

I had done about 12 sessions with him, and felt comfortable with him. He called me one afternoon a couple of hours before our session to tell me the gym was closed for equipment maintenance. I told him I understood and to enjoy his day off, but he invited me to his place to workout in his home gym free of charge for the inconvenience. Between the trust I had established with him and the flirty comments he made, I was actually excited to go to his place. I even thought that maybe he was interested in me. I ran home to change and met him at his place just a few minutes before our 5 o clock session. I knocked on the door and waited just a little bit too long before he opened the door. His usually combed hair was ruffled and he was already sweating, but I didn’t think much of it. 

His house was average sized and nothing fancy on the outside. I can’t say I was surprised he was, as far as I knew, single and living alone. I didn’t expect much yard decor or any flowers. On the inside his house was incredibly nice. It was clean and most of the furniture he had was genuine leather. I could tell it was at least two stories, but there was a closed door in an odd spot of the house. Not like a, “this area was built on after the house had been standing for a while” door, but a “this has to lead to a basement or closet” type of door. It wouldn’t have made sense to be another room. We made a little bit of small talk and my suspicion was confirmed. He told me his home gym was in his basement. 

As soon as he told me we would be going into his basement his demeanor changed, but I don’t know how to explain it. He was acting the same way as always. He didn’t say anything that threw me off, but for some reason something about him just seemed threatening all of the sudden. Maybe it was his smile. It looked different, wider. His eyebrows were sitting differently than usual. I guess the best word to describe him would be rigid. Something inside of me told me I didn’t need to go into that basement. I thank god to this day that I listened to my gut instinct even though it hit me out of nowhere. 

I asked him if I could use his bathroom and told him I would meet him downstairs after. He pointed out his bathroom and told me it wouldn’t be a problem. I went inside, locked the door, and waited to hear him start going towards the basement. The walls were thin so it wasn’t hard to hear what was going on. He opened the basement door and I heard an echoed scream. It sounded like someone yelling for help, but they couldn’t get all of it out. Then there was a thud. My heart dropped. I heard him shut the basement door quickly and run towards the front door. There was silence for a minute, and then I heard it. The deadbolt. He locked the door. 

Full panic set in at that point. He was mumbling something to himself but I couldn’t make it out. He was pacing back and forth for a while, and then he finally called out to me. 

“Cassandra,” it was a question at first then it wasn’t. “Cassandra I know you heard that, it was just the neighbor kids playing. Come on out when you’re ready okay.” 

Bullshit. That came from down stairs, but what do you say at that point. I thought on it, “be out in just a second.” 

My heart was racing. I could hear him walking towards the bathroom door, but it was clear he was trying to tip toe. I knew I had to look for something to protect myself. A razor, scissors, even cologne I could use as mace. There was nothing. What felt like hours passed by. I hadn’t heard anymore movement, so I knew he was still by the door. Then my phone rang. The buzzing startled me so bad I thought I was going to pass out, but I knew it was my only hope so I scrambled to answer. It was Karen. 

She sounded cheerful, but I could also hear confusion in her voice. 

“Hey honey,” she paused “I’m at Cardio Center I thought I’d run into you and Jason. Don’t you have sessions on Tuesdays.” 

This nightmare was only growing more terrifying. Jason. My trainers name is Micheal. I was frozen and Karen noticed because she asked if I was okay. 

“Karen, did you say Jason?” My voice was shaky and I could barely whisper no matter how hard I tried. 

That’s when he started banging on the door. He spoke through laughter, “Your friend’s gonna hear you die.” 

I hadn’t told Micheal that I got his number from Karen. Apparently I hadn’t told Karen that Micheal was my trainers name. I assumed she would know. 

“Yeah, Jason, Jason Richards. Are you playing some kind of trick?” she giggled at herself. 

Micheal had walked away from the bathroom door, I could hear him pacing again. Somehow his distance was scarier. If he went much further I wouldn’t be able to hear him anymore.   

“Karen, I’m with Micheal Sanchez.” My voice broke. I was about to cry. “From Fitness world, the gyms closed today Im at his house.” 

I could hear her soft gasp, “What’s your location?” 

“223 Walnut Avenue,” I was speaking so quiet I wasn’t even sure she could hear me anymore. 

The banging on the door started again. This time it was harder. He was trying to break down the door. 

He laughed again. It was such a human sound but it was laced with an indescribable evil. “Don’t bother with that doll, you’ll be dead long before anyone else gets here.” 

I dropped my phone, and rushed to push my body against the door. He pounded harder and harder. The wood was staring to splinter. He was still taunting me. I started to accept I was going to die. I wish I could tell you that I heard sirens in the distance. That I opened the door and faced Micheal. That I managed to escape him. I can’t. I don’t remember how I got out of the bathroom. I don’t remember the ride to the police station. I don’t even remember giving a statement. 

It turns out that Karen had two numbers for trainers in her phone. She had pre-gamed the office party and given me the number for Micheal in her tipsy state. She hadn’t trained with him in months. He had been fired from Cardio Center for inappropriate conduct with clients. 

When the police came to my rescue they searched Micheal’s basement. They found a college girl who hadn’t been reported missing yet in his basement. He was charged with one count of first degree kidnapping and one count of attempted kidnapping. He had a few more charges from what he did to the college girl he kidnapped but they weren’t made public. I don’t see how what he did to me was an “attempt.” If Karen hadn’t called me who knows how long I would’ve been in that basement, or if I would’ve even made it out alive. Either way, he was sentenced to 50 years without the possibility of parole. I’ll never have to see him again, and he’ll never have to chance to take advantage of any other women.
