[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mqlrnm/simpatias/)

Since I posted my account, I decided to go back and investigate the notebook. But before that, I had made some other investigations.

First, I’ll treat the day I discovered Sophia’s disappearance as day 1, to better organize the timeline of events. That means today would be day 11.

So, I’ll report my progress here, following the order in which I discovered things:

Day 2\*\*.\*\* It was a Sunday. I really shut myself inside all day. Spent most of the time in bed, at my mother-in-law’s house. I’ve always had my ups and downs with mood. And when I get low, I end up isolating myself. My wife was already used to it, so she just decided to support me by giving me some space. It usually worked, but this time I wasn’t just depressed.

I couldn’t stop thinking about the crap I might have done. At that point, I had a theory. Didn’t take a genius. I must have gotten interested in this Sophia. Must have felt guilty for thinking about another woman. Must have found that damn notebook and tried using the so-called “Simpatia” to make an annoying thought disappear. And she disappeared.

Of course, for that, I had to assume the notebook and the things in it were real. But to me, it seemed even more insane not to believe. Besides literally making the girl vanish, I also forgot about her. About the notebook. And God knows what else. That seemed to make even less sense.

If that Simpatia was a spell to make someone vanish, should it also make the user forget? I don’t think so. And the other way around too. If the Simpatia was for forgetting something, that shouldn’t make someone disappear.

On top of that, I also forgot the notebook. “This crap doesn’t work. But I’ll try again.” I remembered my own comment written in the notebook. One I didn’t remember making.

Could that have made things go out of control? Did I perform the Simpatia twice in a row? Well, that was my best theory at the time.

After spending the rest of the day depressed, eventually it was dinner time. We ate, packed our things, and said our goodbyes. I would need to work early the next morning.

On the bus ride home, I had an unpleasant thought. Nothing could guarantee I had really only done the Simpatia twice. What else had I forgotten? I decided to look for where I had noticed this the first time. On Instagram.

I don’t usually follow people I know personally, only content creators I follow. So, by combing through my following list, if I found someone else I didn’t remember, it could be a clue.

I searched the list again and again, several times, until our bus reached the stop near our house. In that inspection, I found two more people I was following but had no idea who they were. Besides Sophia herself, whom I had already unfollowed.

Eliot, a young Black man with braids in his hair. He also hadn’t posted for weeks. “Damn.” I thought. But maybe it was too early to assume he was missing, or that I had anything to do with it.

And there was one more. Edgar. Small, pale, kind of emo-looking. He must have been my age or a little younger. I had never seen him in my life. And, as I thought, his most recent post was 4 weeks ago.

When I got home, I decided it was time to stop keeping this to myself. If I kept thinking about these things alone, I’d probably go insane. Maybe there was something really obvious in all this, and I just wasn’t seeing it.

Lara, my wife, was quite spiritual. Maybe because of her upbringing. Though not tied to any specific denomination. When I told her everything, she not only quickly believed that it could be true, but immediately began thinking of protections and countermeasures. She recommended prayers, rosaries, herb baths, all kinds of things.

But she stood by me the whole time. First, she showed me that my initial assumption about why I would have used the Simpatia to erase Sophia didn’t make much sense anymore. Since there were two other people missing. We decided we wouldn’t touch the notebook again until we had more information.

On Monday, the third day, I was absorbed again by my work routine, and didn’t have much time to deal with all this. However, there was one observation I could make. On the fourth day, I went with some coworkers to an ice cream shop across from the company after lunch.

While pulling out my credit card to pay for the ice cream, I saw it. The same ten-real bill. Old, worn, apparently once wet. The bill I had given to the beggar on the morning of the first day. Which had then appeared again that night, when I bought a popsicle. The change, two two-real bills, were still there. This time it wasn’t just a suspicion, I needed to perform a conscious test. An experiment. Discreetly, I drew a triangle on the corner of the bill. Then I paid.

For the rest of the day, I kept checking my wallet. Minute by minute, anxious. Nothing. I checked every moment, all day, and at night, until I went to bed—nothing. The next morning, it was the first thing I did. And as I suspected, there it was. The ten-real bill, exactly the same. But the triangle I had drawn wasn’t there.

I told Lara what happened, and she thought it best not to use the bill anymore. We didn’t know if it could have some kind of consequence. We put the bill in an envelope and hid it. But no matter what we did, the next day, there was always another identical bill in my wallet. It wasn’t the same bill. They were multiplying.

Nothing new happened in the following days, and only on the sixth day did we make progress.

Lara had gotten in touch with Sophia’s family. It was the only lead we had to keep trying to find out what happened. She told Mrs. Ferreira she had a small podcast, but that it could help spread the story.

The podcast was something we’d wanted to do for a while. Never got off the ground. Probably wouldn’t now either. But it was a good excuse to talk to her. So she went to their house after the gym, and when she got home that night, she showed me the recording:

“Already recording, we can begin. Mrs. Ferreira, do you remember the day she disappeared?”

“Yes. It was a month ago. I noticed she was missing during breakfast, thought she was going to be late for college. When I went to her room to wake her up, thinking she was still asleep…” Mrs. Ferreira’s voice cracked. “I’m sorry…”

“Don’t worry.”

“When I got to the room, she wasn’t there. There were no signs of forced entry, no struggle. The window was closed. Not a single object was missing from the room.”

“I’m so sorry, Mrs. Ferreira. And the night before, did you see her come home?”

“Yes, she got home from the gym at night. I cooked for her. We sat on the couch watching TV, until she went to her room to sleep. That was the last time I saw her.” From her voice, you could tell she was making an effort to hold back tears.

“And your son…” She tried to change the subject. “He was already traveling at the time?”

“No. Edgar got a job offer in Salvador right after his sister disappeared. He couldn’t miss the opportunity, but he calls every day asking for updates.”

A moment of silence followed.

“Edgar? That’s his name?” Lara asked, a bit apprehensively.

“Yes. Look here.”

Another moment of silence. Later Lara told me that at this point, Mrs. Ferreira showed a framed photo. In it were Mrs. Ferreira, her husband, Sophia, and him, Edgar. The Edgar I had found on Instagram. Lara recognized him immediately. The silence stretched a bit longer, then she continued.

“What did the police say about the disappearance?”

“Well. There were no signs of a struggle. No indication of violence, kidnapping, or anything of the sort. The police believe she left of her own free will. But that’s absurd!”

At that moment, she couldn’t hold back her tears anymore, but she continued between sobs.

“My daughter was very loved in this house. She never had problems with anyone. She was a good girl. A studious girl. She had no reason to leave!”

Lara comforted her, and the audio continued for a few minutes with nothing but her crying. Until she pulled herself together.

“As a last question, Mrs. Ferreira, I’d like to ask if you have any theory about what might have happened.”

“I don’t know, dear. Everything about this story is very strange. I think she may have left on her own, but not by her own will. Maybe she was being threatened by someone. I don’t know…”

After that, clearly poor Mrs. Ferreira wasn’t in any condition to continue. Lara thanked her again, promising to send her the podcast when it was released. Then she left.

After listening to the audio, we spent the rest of the night thinking about it. Edgar, the other guy I had found while looking through unknown faces on my Instagram following list, was Sophia’s brother. However, even if he hadn’t posted anything recently, he wasn’t missing like his sister.

Which led us directly to Eliot. The other person I had found while searching. We dug through the boy’s posts, and he hadn’t made any video or post saying he was traveling or anything like that. The only thing we found, that could give us some direction, was that Eliot apparently lived in Salvador. The same city where Edgar was now.

We didn’t make much more progress after that. That night I had a nightmare. In it, I saw Sophia. She looked desperate, running in an endless void. She seemed to be fleeing from something. She was coming toward me, reaching out her hand and screaming desperately for help. But I couldn’t move, and no matter how much I stretched out my hand, I could never reach her.

On the seventh day, I decided to look at the notebook again. Something told me there had to be answers there. I had little time because of work. And Lara had to take care of some college things too. But in the little free time I had each day, I dedicated myself to cataloging the Simpatias in the notebook.

First, I numbered the pages. There were ninety-nine, of which 57 were filled and 42 blank. There didn’t seem to be any torn-out pages. So, to organize things better, I wrote an index on the last pages of the notebook, giving a title and page number to each Simpatia. In total, there were 33.

I had made that list just by looking at the first line of the Simpatias. But there was a lot of text, and comments to verify. On the eighth day after Sophia’s disappearance, I looked at the notebook again. To my surprise, the index at the back of the notebook had vanished. As had the numbers I’d written on the blank pages. The numbers I wrote on the pages that already had something written remained. Later, I remade the index on a separate sheet of paper.

The next day, Saturday, we had more time to continue our investigation. I was thinking of trying to use one of the notebook’s Simpatias. Lara was vehemently against it. But if it worked, maybe it could solve everything. I even had one in mind. One that could bring back everything I had forgotten.

*“To discover something that is hidden: On a Monday before sunrise, you must go to a river or lake. When the first ray of light rises on the horizon, submerge your head in the water three times. Each time you lift your head from the water, you must say one of three phrases: Dad told me to forget, and I will obey. Mom told me to forget, and I will obey. But I wanted to know (say your petition here), so the man at the bottom of the lake told me. After this, turn your back to the lake and repeat three times: ‘Now I know.’ If you did everything right, you must be asleep before midnight that same day. Exactly at midnight, you will receive in a dream what you asked to know.”*

Below, as always, a few comments:

“Each phrase must be said when you lift your head from the water, not before. I lost several weeks messing that up.” It looked like a woman’s handwriting. With a blue ballpoint pen.

Some short comments saying it didn’t work. And the stamp “Trash” that I had already seen on other pages.

At the end, someone filled almost the entire page with a repeated comment: *“Don’t ask what you shouldn’t know”* *“Don’t ask what you shouldn’t know”* *“Don’t ask what you shouldn’t know”* *“Don’t ask what you shouldn’t know”*…

The handwriting in black ink, apparently desperate, more shaky and smudged with each line. “Okay…” I thought “Maybe Lara is right to think this is dangerous…”

Either way. This is my only chance. Maybe this can put an end to this whole story. I had to try.

Today is the eleventh day. Monday. I woke up at three in the morning, everything still dark around here. The nearest river was half an hour away by bike. I managed to arrive before the first rays of sun. Took off my sneakers, stepped into the water’s edge, bent down and got ready. Eyes fixed on the horizon, without blinking.

As soon as the sun rose with its first rays of light, I plunged my head into the water. Lifted it quickly, gasping for air, and shouted:

“Dad told me to forget, and I will obey!”

I had the impression I saw someone at a distance in my peripheral vision. For a moment, I feared I was embarrassing myself. But I had no time to worry about that. I quickly plunged my head a second time. For some reason, I opened my eyes underwater. The sky was already getting light, and I was in the shallows. I should have seen the ground near me, but instead, I saw an abyss, meters and meters away from me. My stomach dropped, as if I were about to fall. I pulled my head up, startled. I was on solid ground. Maybe it had been some optical illusion. Without thinking further, I filled my lungs and said:

“Mom told me to forget, and I will obey!”

The figure in my peripheral vision was now undeniable, someone was getting closer. But I didn’t take my eyes off the horizon. I bent down again, this time making sure to keep my eyes closed when submerging my head. I received the cold embrace of the river. The sensation of falling took hold of my stomach. It was like a magnetic force pulling me down, I felt I would fall. With all my strength, I rose up in a brusque movement, splashing water everywhere. Before even opening my eyes, I gasped and shouted even louder:

“But I wanted to know everything I chose to forget, so the man at the bottom of the lake told me!”

The silence after my shout filled the environment so much, I couldn’t even hear the river anymore. I felt a weight lift from my shoulders. I breathed in relief. But nothing could have prepared me for what I saw when I finally opened my eyes.

In front of me, standing. The figure that had been in my peripheral vision was now standing in the river, right in front of me. He wore what must once have been a suit, now completely rotted by time, covered in slime and moss. His face, swollen and corpse-like, twisted into a yellowish grin. His eyes… I will never be able to forget those yellow, milky eyes, as if I were staring into an animated corpse. Or death itself.

Terrified, I threw myself back, letting out a loud scream. Fell seated in the water, fumbling desperately for the rosary Lara had given me. When I looked forward again, nothing. He was gone. On another occasion, I would have doubted my sanity. But I know what I saw.

It took me a while to get up. Now remembering, as I write this, it’s funny how most people imagine a shock situation, because it’s very different in reality. I felt anesthetized, my heart pounding as if it would burst from my chest. A metallic taste spread in my mouth. By the time I came back to myself, nearly fifteen minutes had passed.

I took my bike and walked it back, unable to think straight. It took me an hour to get home, and when I did, I could only sit on the porch, staring at the horizon for long minutes. As my thoughts began to organize again in my head, and I grew less dazed, I was already late for work. I couldn’t work like this.

I called work to say I wasn’t well and would need to take the day off. Then I stayed there, staring into the void for a few more hours. Remembering that thing in the lake. Thinking about how much Lara, frightened, warned me this could be dangerous. Now it’s too late. It’s already done.

I spent the rest of the day writing this account, to share before going to sleep. And in a few hours, I’ll have my answer. I hope I can handle it.
