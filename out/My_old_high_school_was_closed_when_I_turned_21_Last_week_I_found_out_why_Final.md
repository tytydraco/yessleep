So much has happened since my [last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1923flv/my_old_high_school_was_closed_when_i_turned_21/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I wanted to let you guys know ahead of time that this is the last time I will be posting. I have some loose ends I need to tie up before I can consider continuing this mission.   
  
Cassandra will continue our mission for a while so I can take care of some family business. These last few weeks have been something else, sometimes it’s still hard for me to believe what’s been happening.   
  
Cassandra and I decided we had to take one last trip to Greenridge High School. There were too many questions left unanswered for us to turn our backs on the building.   
  
We still had no idea why people had a different glow, why the trash can was glowing, and especially what the groundskeeper was doing with the dairy. In the back of my mind, I also wondered why he was friendly until I went through the dirt.

\-  
  
We went through the diary page by page, and what we found was extremely disturbing. I can’t take you through every page here, so I’m going to give you some of the highlights.   
  
The diary belonged to Taylor Brown, she was a student at the high school at some point. All of the dates on top of each page were scribbled out by her pen though, and for a good reason.   
  
Taylor wrote about all of the weird and unexplained things she was seeing in high school. On multiple occasions teachers would quit, or disappear, only to be back in the school a couple of days later. Notably, her science teacher quit four times, and each time she came back. Taylor wrote about how the woman was clearly unstable, going as far as to toss rulers at her students but no one found this odd.   
  
Another page talked about how she followed the custodian one afternoon because he had been watching a student all day, the student's name was scribbled out. She followed him to the basement where she said the walls were pulsing and moving. She said it looked like the basement was breathing, she did not stay down there to look around.   
  
We also learned something troubling, appearly, Taylor knew Kira. There are pages upon pages talking about their friendship. They were in drama class together. Taylor said that she didn’t get a major role like Kira. Notably, Taylor was in school the day Kira was murdered. She wrote about how the police came to remove her body, but the rest of the school day went on like nothing happened. Kira didn’t have a funeral.   
  
We filled Kira in on everything we read but she didn’t remember Taylor, she couldn't remember what play she was in either. Cassandra and I decided not to push her too hard, and instead focus on what we did know.   
  
\-  
  
Before we left for our last trip, we organized all of the information we already knew. We saved Kira Jones, we learned her last name from Taylor's diary. Kira did remember her last name once we said it to her. We also saved Hunter James and Coraline Clarke. Kira was glowing blue, Coraline was glowing red, and Hunter was glowing orange.   
  
All of the killers were the same except for the man with the baseball bat.    
  
I went through the list of killers with Cassandra. The red mask killer is the man who murdered Kira in the auditorium. We haven’t seen him since the first day we went back and we are still under the assumption that he is stuck in the auditorium. We are not sure it’s even a man though.   
  
The killer mascot is always upstairs, an area that we haven't explored and will not be exploring anytime soon. He wears the school mascot head and tosses hatchets.   
  
The hockey mask killer was in the gym hallway, an area I would’ve liked to explore more. In the girls’ locker room, I saw a girl escape out of the window, she was glowing green. We suspect that the girl who was glowing green made it out alive, but we have nothing else to go on regarding her.   
  
The woman who throws glass beakers is probably the same woman who Taylor was writing about.   
  
Finally, the killer who murdered Cassandra and Hunter. He was wearing a coach jacket. Cassandra and I believe that all of the killers were teachers or faculty. We could only confirm this if we had anyone's names.   
  
\-  
  
Cassandra and I took the list of names and our backpacks, we left the trio of teenagers at my house and took her car. I figured I would leave mine for Kira in case they needed a way to leave the house. We stressed the importance of all of them staying inside.   
  
“So what is our goal exactly? If this is the last time we are going in.” Cassandra asked me as we got in her car.   
  
“We have to investigate the basement,” I responded as I buckled up.   
  
The drive to the school felt somber, the only reason I wanted to check the basement was because I was sure we would finally find some answers. A room that “breathes” has to mean something in the grand scheme of things.   
  
As we pulled up to the school, I opened the door and looked for the groundskeeper. He wasn’t outside but it looked like he put the dirt in the hole I made.   
  
“We should part right out front,” I suggested to Cassandra.   
  
“I think the door to the basement is in the first staircase,” Cassandra said as she pulled up and we got out of the car. I was armed with my flashlight while Cassandra had a flashlight and a crowbar.   
  
Walking into the high school for the last time felt different. I waited by the door for a second to make sure we weren't going to be jumped.   
  
“Do you think the school gets angry when we remove a spirit?” Cassandra asked me as we moved through the hallways.   
  
“Well, it would make sense. We were fine last time until we decided to help Coraline and Hunter.” I agreed with Cassandra as we slowly checked each of the doorways. Neither of us could remember this part of the building.   
  
“I wonder if Kira was murdered because Taylor was getting curious,” I mumbled as we opened the door to a classroom.   
  
“It is weird that school went on that day like nothing happened,” Cassandra said as she tried to step into a classroom. I watched her face hit a barrier. Cassandra took two steps back and grabbed her nose with her free hand.   
  
“What the hell?” I asked.   
  
I walked over to the classroom and put my foot out. My boot hit an invisible wall. We couldn’t enter this room or any of the other classrooms we tried. We both thought it was weird but decided to keep looking for the staircase.   
  
“I don’t think the groundskeeper is evil.” I signed to Cassandra.   
  
“He tried to kill you.” She pointed out.   
  
When we found the staircase, I entered first. I knew we had to go down but I tried to use the stairs to go up and found another invisible barrier. I made a note of it and turned around to go downstairs.   
  
“He was helpful before I messed with his dirt,” I told Cassandra.   
  
She opened her mouth to respond to me but quickly shut it when we heard whistling coming from the next floor down.   
  
\-   
  
I readied my flashlight, fully prepared to hit a killer over the head with it. I had its name all figured out, I was going to call it, The Whistler.   
  
When we turned the corner we were both surprised to see an old man standing over a mop bucket. He was cleaning the floor.   
  
“Hello?” Cassandra called out to him. I could see her gripping the crowbar harder.   
  
The man put the mop back into the bucket and smiled at Cassandra.   
  
“A Spirit Medium and a Spirit Walker. Come to see the heart of the school?” He asked us as he added more soap to the bucket.   
  
“What?” Cassandra asked.   
  
“The heart? Like, when we open this door a heart will be inside?” I asked.   
  
He only laughed at us.   
  
“Inside you’ll find the place where it all started. You’ll know what to do when you get inside. But, be warned, everything about your lives will change when you go inside.” He said as he reached into his pocket. He reached out and handed me two batteries.   
  
“Your flashlight will need those.” He warned me as he went up the stairs.   
  
We stood there in silence for a moment. My flashlight battery eventually went out, I was pretty surprised and grateful to the man for giving me a new set.   
  
“Are you sure we should go in here?” Cassandra asked me as we looked at the door.   
  
“Are lives have already changed a lot. How could it possibly get weirder?” I said as I watched Cassandra reach for the doorknob.   
  
“I hope you didn’t jinx us,” Cassandra grumbled as she slowly opened the door.   
  
\-  
  
As we walked into the basement we were hit with the smell of old air and gasoline. I crinkled my nose and continued pushing forward.   
  
We used our flashlights to scan as much of the room as possible. Eventually, Cassandra's flashlight settled on the west wall, and we slowly walked over. From where we were standing we could make out a lot of pictures.   
  
As we got closer, we both had to take a second and process what we were seeing.   
  
There were pictures of each of the students on the wall, each one connected to a thin red wire. Each student's picture was connected to a different killer, rarely did students seem to share a killer.   
  
Kira, Hunter, and Coraline were all there. Each one is connected to the killer that murdered them. I watched Cassandra reach up and take a picture of a blonde girl off of the wall.   
  
“Your sister?” I asked her.   
  
“Hannah,” Cassandra said through her teeth.   
  
There was a picture next to Hannah’s, that kid didn’t make it. Cassandra pulled his picture down too, I assumed she knew him.    
  
Everything was here, even Taylor had a picture. She wrote for the school newspaper. The teenagers who were murdered had red wire and the ones who got away had green wire. Taylor didn’t have any wire attached to her picture, instead, her picture was plastered in the middle of the board next to a man we didn’t recognize. Some guy named Noah.   
  
There was too much here for us to get a good look at, plus, all of the papers and notebooks under the board. Someone spent a lot of time putting this together. The longer I looked at everything the more I realized I didn’t know this place at all. This was not the school I remembered.   
  
“Pack up everything,” I told Cassandra as I put my light down to start filling my backpack with as much as it could carry.   
  
“This is unbelievable,” Cassandra said as she shoved as much as possible into her bag. We had to take the board apart to make everything fit.   
  
Once we finished I took my light and pointed it further down the hallway. Something was coming, I could hear boots hitting the floor. Before I could shout at Cassandra to brace herself, something hit my body.   
  
\-  
  
It wasn’t a bad feeling by any means. A wave of cold washed over me, my heart was beating frantically yet I felt still. My head felt heavy for a moment before it all came rushing back to me.   
  
My name is Caleb, and I never went to this school. I went to a private school, and the memories I had of this place were mostly fabricated. I could see my life flashing before my eyes, I saw my mom sending me to the school bus. I saw my father taking me to my football games.   
  
I had no real memories of Greenridge High School. Something drew me here. Something wanted me here.   
  
\-  
  
“Caleb!” Cassandra snapped at me as she pulled me to my feet.   
  
“Holy shit,” I said as I grabbed Cassandra by her forearm.   
  
“Did you see that?” I asked her.   
  
“Yes.” Cassandra gasped as another wave of air washed over us.   
  
The air wasn’t strong enough to knock us down this time, so we both decided to continue pushing forward. I was going to get answers.   
  
As we went deeper into the basement the waves of air got stronger until eventually we found what was causing the air.    
  
In the middle of the floor, a young man was sitting hunched over a book. He was glowing red, a bright red, almost like Coraline was. I could see the blood running down his face, the drops of blood were hitting the glowing yellow book.   
  
“Hello?” Cassandra called the boy.   
  
“You need to leave.” The boy warned. He looked up at us and clenched the book harder.   
  
“She’s coming!” He screamed.   
  
\-  
  
I didn’t have a chance to ask who was coming before I heard a loud screen. I moved my flashlight up as quickly as possible but something threw me back, my feet left the floor and my back hit the wall.   
  
I coughed loudly and fell to my knees.   
When I looked up I watched as Cassandra was tossed to the side, twice. Her body hit the wall once and was quickly lifted again, she was slammed again and this time whatever was attacking let her body hit the floor.   
  
Nothing was here, nothing was grabbing Cassandra. We were being attacked by air.   
  
I quickly scrambled to my feet to try and get to her, and that’s when I saw the woman. She was wearing a long black dress. Her hair was in a tight bun, and her glasses were completely cracked.   
  
She screamed at me again and put both of her hands out. I couldn’t move. My blood felt like it was on fire, my eyes felt like they were going to burst.   
  
“You have to block her magic!” The boy screamed. I could see him doing motions with his arms but I couldn’t move.   
  
“Let him go!” Cassandra screamed as she smacked the woman with a crowbar. Black blood flew all over the floor.   
  
I felt the woman's hold on me release. I could breathe again.   
  
Cassandra swung down to hit the woman again, I watched as she was flung into the air. Cassandra hit a pipe and landed face-first on the ground.   
  
I could barely process what was going on.  
  
Behind the woman, I could see the boy doing arm motions. I copied one, I crossed my arms when she reached out to me. I could feel her energy trying to hit me, but nothing was happening.   
  
I was sliding back though. The main coursing through my bad arm was too intense, but I knew putting it down was going to be a death sentence. I couldn’t keep this up for much longer.   
  
“Cassandra! You have to get up!” I screamed at her.   
  
I could hear my arm breaking. I screamed in pain as my back finally hit a wall.   
  
I should've left instructions to the trio in case we died.   
  
“Die!” Cassandra screeched as she slammed the crowbar into the back of the woman's head. Her body crumbled forward and black blood hit the floor.    
  
“We have to go.” Cassandra coughed out. Her nose was broken, she had blood all over her lips.   
  
“The boy.” I hissed.   
  
“Kid?” Cassandra called into the darkness.   
  
“As long as she lives I can’t leave.” The boy said to us from somewhere. He was no longer sitting in the middle of the floor.   
  
“We killed her.” I insisted. Cassandra slammed a crowbar through the back of her head, no one could live from that.   
  
“She will get back up. Take the book and go.” The boy said.   
  
Cassandra reached down and lifted the yellow book from the floor. I felt sick to my stomach, we couldn’t just leave him here. But I also knew we were not going to beat that woman a second time.   
  
\-  
  
Once we left the basement and started heading upstairs, we could tell something had changed with the school. All of the lights were on, power was back. It felt nice to turn off my flashlight. I wondered what we did, we didn’t save the boy and apparently, we didn’t kill that woman.   
  
As we walked back into the main hallway, we were both shocked to see the janitor cleaning the floor.   
  
“Be safe out there.” He said to us as we walked by him.   
  
“Thank you,” I told him sincerely.   
  
\-   
  
“Do you think we won?” Cassandra asked me as she leaned back in her seat.   
  
“No. It feels like we took the bandaid off of a much larger problem. But, we saved three people and finally have what we need to get answers.” I told Cassandra.   
  
She laughed, and I laughed with her because we both knew we could be sorting through all of those papers for weeks.
