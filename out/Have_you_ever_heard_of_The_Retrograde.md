I first heard about “The Retrograde” when I was about fourteen years old.  There was an old, late night radio show called “Razor Ronnie” where the host would get all kinds of weirdos as guests or calling in.  They’d talk about ghosts and aliens, bigfoot and ESP, and I ate all that shit right up.  But there was one night where some dude called in talking about something that was changing people.  He called it The Retrograde.

It was weird and interesting at the time, but that was almost twenty years ago, and I’d long since forgotten about Razor Ronnie and the Retrograde.  That is, until I met Susan Melnor.  

When I first met Susan, she was sitting in a teal bathrobe watching a game show in the recreation room of the Pine Valley State Sanitarium.  She’d been committed there indefinitely five years earlier after being found both incompetent to stand trial and not criminally responsible due to her ongoing psychiatric issues.  Not that you could tell from looking at her.  She was clean and well-kempt—pretty even, and when she looked over at our approach, her gaze wasn’t cloudy or crazed, but cool and intelligent as she looked between me and the orderly.

“Here to talk to me?”

The orderly gave a small chuckle.  “Yes, that’s right, Susan.  This is Colin.  He’s doing a paper for his doctorial…” he glanced at me as though for confirmation.  “…thesis.  And he asked to speak to you, if you’re willing.”

She had paled slightly, and I could see a new tension in her face and body language as she turned in her chair to face us.  When she didn’t say anything, I took a step forward and spoke up.

“I…I don’t mean to pry.  And if you’re not willing to talk to me about what happened, I’ll go.  I just…I think if I can understand more of what happened, a lot of people would be interested in what you remember about it.”

Her mouth twisted slightly and she gave a curt nod.  “It’s fine.  Just...”  She looked back at the intern.  “Bobby, can we get one of the visit rooms?”

He pondered it a moment and then shook his head.  “Sorry, Suze.  Both full at the moment.  You know how weekends are.  But if anyone comes over while you two are talking I’ll head them off.”

She nodded.  “Okay.”  Susan watched him walk off before turning back to me.  “So you want to know about me killing my husband and baby.”

Swallowing hard, I sat down in the chair across from her.  I already knew a lot.  I’d seen the police reports and court transcripts, as well as two prior mental evaluations that had been made part of the public record back when they were still trying to send her to prison.

By all accounts, Susan Melnor had been a nice, normal woman.  She’d married her high school sweetheart when they graduated college, and she’d worked as a successful real estate agent in the area for years before taking some time off to have their first baby, a little girl named Jeri.  Everyone said she was a good wife and mother, with no history of substance abuse, violence, or mental illness.

Then one night in October of 2015, she drugged her husband during their evening meal.  Once he was fully out, she tied him up and drug him into the living room where she soaked him with gas and set him on fire.  Then, before the fire department could get a call from a concerned neighbor, she took Jeri into the bathroom and drowned her in the toilet.

Feeling her eyes on me, I looked up from my notepad and forced myself to meet her gaze.  “I know what you did.  I want to know why you did it.  Or, at least, why you *think* you did it.”

She gave me a thin smile.  “What kind of paper is this?”

“A psych thesis with a focus on abnormal psychology.  I’m focusing on the correlation between delusions and breakdowns in logic.”

Susan studied me for a moment.  “So basically why crazy people can’t see that their delusions don’t make sense.”

I smiled.  “Or the extent to which they do make some kind of sense, yes.”

She nodded.  “That’s cool.  I wanted to go into psychology for a minute.  Then I took the 100-level class and it was super boring.  No offense.”

I shrugged.  “None taken.  Some of it is boring.  But not this.”

“Yeah, I guess not.  I’ve told plenty of other people, so why not one more.  I killed my husband because he *wasn’t* my husband.  Not anymore.  He’d changed into something else.”

I tried to keep my face neutral.  “I remember reading some about that.  You thought he was possessed or something.  Like an alien or a demon?”

She frowned at me.  “I never said alien.  Or demon.  And I never said possessed.  To me possession is like…like a stranger coming into your house and pretending it’s theirs.  Maybe you’re home and trapped in the basement, or maybe you aren’t there at all, but either way they’re occupying something they shouldn’t be.  This wasn’t that.”

“What was it then?”

Staring at me for several moments, she suddenly flashed a hard smile.  “Fuck it.  Why not?  My lawyers said not to talk to anyone about this part.  They were afraid I could get the needle if I admitted to torturing him, but that’s done now, and I’m probably never getting out of here.  So yeah.  When I killed the thing that looked like Tony…my husband…I tortured it a bit first.  I wanted to know what was going on.  If there was a way to understand, to maybe get my Tony back, even to prove to myself I *was* crazy, though I knew in my heart of hearts that wasn’t true.”  She wiped at her eye.  “Because I didn’t *want* any of this to be real, you understand?  I didn’t want to do what I did.”

Looking up from feverishly taking notes, I gave her a nod.  “I get that.  So you hurt him some so he’d talk.”

She shrugged.  “I tried to hurt him, but he didn’t really care.  I’ve always thought he just told me because he wanted me to know.  Or because there was some purpose behind it I didn’t understand.  But he wasn’t hurting or scared, I know that.  I’d drugged him, tied him up, soaked him with gas, and cut and stabbed him a couple of times, but he just smiled at me.  He didn’t even look groggy any more, and I would have swore he was passed out dead five minutes earlier.  Seeing that terrible smile, I wanted to just burn him then and there, but I stopped myself.  I needed answers, and so I started with the most important question.

**** 

*Where is Tony?*

**He is gone.**

*Where is he gone, you bastard?  Where did you put him?*

**Put him?  I didn’t put him anywhere.  I ate him.  Ate his shadow and took its place.**

*You’re fucking lying!  Tell me where he is.*

**How would I do that, you stupid cow?  Would I shit out blood and bones when I’ve eaten none?**

*I…oh God…I…what are you?*

**You’ve seen, haven’t you?  I’ve seen you watching me.  Seen you see me in here.**

*Yes.  But what are you?*

**The Retrograde.**

**** 

I sat back in my chair as she said the last.  Why did that sound so familiar to me?  Something…retrograde amnesia?  No, it wasn’t that.  Something else…some old, dim memory I couldn’t fully see.  I came back to myself as Susan was standing up and walking away.

“Wait!  I wanted to find out more.”

She shrugged without turning around.  “Sorry, but I’m done talking about that today.  It’s not easy.  Come back another time and I’ll tell you more.”

I started to say something more, but Bobby the Orderly had heard the last and was giving me a stony look as he shook his head.  Leave her be, that look said, and I realized he was right.  I was being an asshole, and if I needed to come back to hear the rest, then I would.

**** 

It took two hours for me to get home, and during the drive I kept fishing for the meaning of The Retrograde.  It wasn’t until I got frustrated and turned on the radio to some afternoon dj that it hit me.  Razor Ronnie.  The guy that had called in that time.

I stayed up half the night searching the internet for information about the Razor Ronnie show and that episode.  The show had been syndicated across five states, staying fairly popular until some larger company bought it out and changed the format a few years back.  Razer Ronnie, aka Lawrence Fencer, quit within six months and the show was dead.  

There was still a small but passionate fanbase online though, and a couple of places I found semi-complete episode lists and summaries covering more than thirteen years worth of weekly shows.  Once I nailed down the episode that the summary called “Caller episode:  Strange sightings and stories.  Poltergeists, gremlins, Retrograde Invaders”, I started looking for actual recordings of the episode.  There were no active databases of the audio anywhere I could find, and so by five in the morning I was posting on several forums with a new online persona and email, asking if anyone had a copy they could send me, and I’d be glad to pay for it.  After that, I collapsed into an exhausted sleep until the following afternoon.

Checking my phone, I saw I had two missed texts and five emails.  The last one was a notification that I’d gotten a reply online.  Sitting up, I went to the forum and found the message.  It just had a clickable link that said:

**I think this is what you’re looking for.**

I considered the threat of viruses for a second, but then I was clicking the link.  It took me to a website that quickly downloaded a .mp3 file labeled “RR813”.  Heart pounding, I started to play it through my phone’s tinny speakers.  The first part was ads, followed by this rant Ronnie always did at the start of every episode about some topic he thought was interesting or funny.

I felt a wave of nostalgia hearing the show, and a part of me wanted to just sit back, let it play, and enjoy it.  Still, I needed to see if this was even the right episode, and if it was, was it at all helpful.  If I could find some strange link between Susan Melnor and a radio show from two decades earlier…well, I wasn’t sure what it’d be, but it’d be something.  So I started scrubbing ahead through the three hour show, stopping every few minutes as Ronnie talked to different callers about the ghost that lives in their tree or the voices coming out of their bathroom drains.  It was a little past the two hour mark when I heard the strange man from my memory speak in crackling tones from somewhere deep within my phone.

**“…when I knew she wasn’t herself anymore.”**

*”Okay now, that’s what I want to get to.  I have people call in all the time with weird stuff.  They say their husband got abducted by aliens.  Or their dog got possessed by the Devil.  Or they went on a blind date with a skinwalker.  So what, my fine gentleman, are you saying was in her?”*

**”Not in her.  It had replaced her.  Said it had come back for her.  To eat her shadow and make things right.”**

*”Just came out and told you all this?  Isn’t that kind of defeating the point of some secret invasion?”*

**”I wondered that at first.  I think I get it now.  I know what I have to do.”**

*”Okay, pal.  Not talking about hurting anyone, right?  Because if you are, I have to end the call and call the cops to check on you.”*

**”I would never hurt another person.”**

*”Okay.  Good.  Glad to hear it.  So…ah, you didn’t ever tell me what these things are.  And why they’re here.  Body snatchers?  Demon monkeys from the Crab Nebula?”*
