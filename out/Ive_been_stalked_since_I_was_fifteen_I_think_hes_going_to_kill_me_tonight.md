I’m writing this because I think I’m in genuine danger. If I am found dead, Cole Miller did it.

It all started on a dating app. I was underage but that was allowed, on this particular dating app. Only fifteen. Swiping, swiping, swiping…

Oof. He’s cute.

I swiped yes, to this boy with dark hair and light eyes; his bio also said he was fifteen. Perfect.

We hit it off. Talking every day. Friendship turned into dates.

But on those dates, this boy was completely different. He would make me uncomfortable. He would touch me in places that I wasn’t comfortable with him touching; especially on the bus.

He wanted to be my boyfriend. I said no. He lost his shit at me. Anger, spitting, rage. Threatening me — that he would kill me one day.

He made friends with my friends, even though I had blocked him. Drove past my house, even though I hadn’t ever told him the suburb I lived in.

‘No Caller ID’ calls were the norm for me. My mother, even answered a few. Asking him to leave me alone. But it was always the same threat, ‘Remember, Maisie, I’m gonna kill you one day.’

We tried to report him to the police, but he had lied about his name. He did not exist. So they didn’t do anything. ‘Keep a diary and you might be able to get a restraining order one day’.

Years went by, and slowly, the calls faded away. The occasional text message here and there from fake numbers still occur, but I started to feel safe. No more unexpected presents that I have to ask the police to check for bombs. No more sitting in front of the TV, staring at the security camera monitors whilst I eat my dinner instead of watching my programme. No more waiting for my friends to message me, saying that they saw him and he spoke about how he’s gonna kill me.

I’m twenty-two now. And for the first time, I feel safe.

Or I felt safe. Until he served me my coffee at my regular coffee shop. I have been going there for a few weeks now. Every morning, I drive past and get a Grande Dirty Chai. 

But the worst part is, I don’t live in Tampa anymore. I live in Vero Beach. Two and a half hours away from Tampa. Did he follow me here? He must’ve. He must’ve. He must’ve. 

He knew my order. Even paid for it with a smile. “On the house, my love.” He had said to me. I cringe thinking about it. But that doesn’t stop my heart, feeling like it’s about to pop out of my chest from the anxiety that I’m feeling. 

On the sleeve of the cup, he wrote a message. 

‘I’ll see you soon xx’. 

When I got home, I locked all the doors and windows of my house. I even locked my cat flap, ensuring that my two cats — Amelia and Hashbrown were inside. 

What if they’re in danger too?

My hands shake at the thought of putting my pets in danger. I only got them because I felt safe enough to finally get them.

I swallow forcefully, before getting out my phone. I should call the police, even though they don’t typically believe me due to the fact that when an unexpected thud in the night occurs, I tend to be quite trigger happy with my phone.

It rings for a few moments, before an officer answers the phone.

“Ah, Maisie, I recognised your number.” He speaks, disgruntled by my phone call. “What seems to be the problem, ma’am?”

The words fly out of my like vomit. “He’s here. In Vero Beach. He served me today at the coffee shop and gave me this note saying that he’s gonna see me soon and-…”

The officer on the other end heaves a big sigh. “You’re right this time Maisie, maybe this something we should look into.” He pauses and I can hear him taking a large sip of coffee. “We’ll investigate in the morning. Until then, sit tight, okay?”

“But Officer, I’m geniunely worried about my safety-…” And click. I hear nothing but faint buzzing from the other end. Did I just get hung up on by a cop? 

I pace back and forth in my kitchen, tapping my fingers against the tub that holds my largest knife. Wondering if I should have it in my hand, now. Just in case. I’d have the best chance if I did.

No. You’re just gonna scare yourself even more.

I sigh to myself, pressing my hand on my forehead before I go to my rear sliding door. Ready to turn off the lights in the backyard, primarily to stop annoying my neighbours and so I stop obsessively staring out of there.

And that’s when I see him. A smiling man in my back garden, with a large knife. Just standing there, smiling at me. He doesn’t move. Almost like he’s frozen. 

I reach for the phone again, but in that moment, I realise that the cops won’t come. They think I’m the girl who cried wolf. It’s just going to be me, and Cole. 

God, talk about a cliche scary movie. All you’d need now is thunder and lightning. 

I can feel my heart pressed against my chest; almost as though it’s about to break free.  But then it hits me, if I’m going to die - this motherfucker isn’t going to get away with it.

So, Reddit, this may be my last post. If I am found dead, Cole Miller did it.
