I’ve tried to ignore the notes. I really have. But they keep showing up.

After I found the third one — the one on my bed that said *“The cracks aren’t cracks. They’re mouths”* — I barely slept that night. I double-checked all the locks, shoved a chair under the doorknob, even blocked the bedroom window with a shelf. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me. Like I wasn’t *alone* in the house.

The next morning, I went to work as usual, trying to act normal. But every time I turned a corner, I felt like someone was just about to appear — always one step behind me. It wasn’t until I got home that things started to get worse.

I was walking through the hallway when I heard it.

Tap.  
Tap. Tap.

It stopped me cold.

The sound was faint, but definitely there. It came from behind the wall — the one between the kitchen and the bathroom. I stood there, holding my breath, waiting. Nothing.

Then again:

Tap. Tap.  
Scratch.

Not like an animal. Slower. Like fingernails on drywall.

I didn’t move for nearly a minute. Finally, I knocked back, just once. Maybe I was hoping it was a pipe or some weird old-house noise. Maybe I was testing myself.

Nothing replied.

Later that night, I was brushing my teeth when I spotted something in the mirror — not a person or shadow, but a smudge near the corner. I leaned closer and realized it was a **tiny piece of paper**, tucked just between the glass and the frame. I pulled it out.

Same yellow paper. Same handwriting.

**"Stop knocking."**

That one shook me. Because that meant whatever — *whoever* — wrote it had seen me do it. Not just seen the house, but seen me *interact* with it.

I started thinking about the previous notes again. Who left them? Why? And more importantly… how?

I remembered what the landlord said when I first moved in: *“Stay out of the attic.”*

I hadn’t gone up there. I’d never even looked at it properly. It was just a square in the ceiling of the hallway with a pull string. I always assumed it was full of insulation and dead bugs, like most attics. But now, with everything that’s been happening, I couldn’t ignore it anymore.

That night, I stood beneath it for a long time. I didn’t pull the string. I didn’t want to see what was up there. I just listened.

I thought I heard something move. Not loudly. Just the softest creak, like someone shifting their weight. I convinced myself it was the wind. I had to.

The next morning, I noticed something new.

The pull string for the attic… it was lower. Only by a couple inches, but I *know* it wasn’t like that before. I’m tall enough to reach it easily, but now it brushed my forehead when I walked by.

I didn’t say anything at work. I didn’t want to sound insane. But when I got home that evening, something was waiting for me.

A new note.

Not folded this time. Just taped to the wall beneath the attic door.

**"It’s awake now."**

That’s all it said.

I stared at it for a long time. I didn’t want to touch it. I didn’t even want to stand near it. I just took a picture on my phone and walked away.

Now I don’t know what to do.

I haven’t gone up there. Not yet.

But I feel like whatever’s in this house… it’s *waiting* for me to.

**Has anyone else ever dealt with something like this? Should I open the attic?**
