I used to dismiss the synchronicities as coincidences.

In primary school, I remember insulting a boy. The next day, another boy insulted me.

Whilst playing football, I accidentally kicked a friend in the shins. That evening, when I was riding my bike, the pedals slammed into my shins.

I punched a bully, causing his left eye to swell and bruise. The next day, on the playground, a basketball hit me in the face, causing my left eye to swell and bruise.

One morning, I pinched a few pounds from my sister’s piggy bank. Then, when I arrived at school, an older kid stole that money from me.

Coincidences, right? I’ve always thought so. In fact, when I became a teenager, I conducted extensive research on the subject. It was confirmation bias, I decided. I was ignoring all of the events that didn’t fit the pattern. That must be it.

The thing is that I’m a good person. I don’t often say mean things about people, and I have never physically hurt someone out of malice. So, I don’t necessarily have an abundance of evidence to support my hypothesis. Still, I have, on occasion, caused harm to people in my life, as has everyone. And I’m absolutely certain that some force in the universe (perhaps a judgemental higher power) always makes sure that the exact same harm is caused to me.

I don’t make a habit of physically harming people, so most of my examples are forms of emotional harm. During my teenage years, I certainly did lots of stupid things and was dealt Karma’s heavy blow in return. I ditched a friend at a party, and then my other friend ditched me. I left my girlfriend for someone prettier, and my new girlfriend left me for someone more handsome. Karma.

I’m now in my late twenties. I always hoped I’d eventually grow out of this superstitious fear, but the coincidences just keep happening. I was a manager for a major legal firm, and it’s a cut-throat industry. I made an employee redundant because we had to find ways to reduce spending. I wasn’t too surprised when I faced the same fate. Three weeks later, my superior shut down our entire branch, making me redundant.

Perhaps you need more evidence. I’m only just getting warmed up, okay?

I cooked a meal for my friends. I’m vegetarian, but I didn’t want to force that on my meat-eating pals, so I prepared a chicken tikka masala for them. Foolishly, I didn’t cook the chicken for long enough, and they all ended up with food poisoning. I was fine. Three days later, however, I ended up with food poisoning after eating at a local restaurant.

Do you need another example? Okay. My girlfriend tripped over one of the shoes I left in the hallway, and she ended up with a nasty cut on her forehead. Later that evening, I ended up with an identical injury after slipping in the shower.

Are you convinced? Maybe you would believe me if you’d spent the last 29 years in my shoes. These events aren’t coincidences. There are too many to count.

Nevertheless, whilst this thought has always filled me with existential dread, I never saw it as a threatening thing. As I said, I’m a good person. I try not to harm people. Most of the harm I’ve caused has been minor and accidental.

Last night, however, everything changed.

I was at the local pub with my girlfriend and a few close friends. We were having a merry time. Everyone in the pub was having a merry time. One man, in particular, was a little too merry.

“Hello, gorgeous,” The man said to my girlfriend, Lauren. “Want a drink?”

I’m not the jealous, over-protective type. I turned my head to face Lauren, and she gave me a look that said she would handle it.

“I’m not interested,” Lauren firmly replied.

The man spat at her. “Well, fuck you.”

“Hey!” I shouted. “Apologise for that.”

The man laughed and asked, “Wanna fuckin’ fight, y’ponce?”

“No,” I replied, looking to the bartender. “I think you should leave.”

Things escalated rapidly. The man shoved me away from him, then he raised his fists. One of my friends stepped between us, and the aggressive stranger immediately landed a right hook, knocking him to the floor.

I saw red.

Before Lauren, the bartender, or any of my friends had a chance to stop me, I charged at the violent man and swung for his face.

One punch.

He fell backwards.

What I did not intend was for the man’s head to connect with the sharp edge of the step behind him.

Paramedics arrived quickly, but they weren’t quick enough. The blow had killed him.

One punch.

One stupid punch.

I’ve spent all day in bed. I’m wracked with guilt, obviously. My friends have tried to console me. They think I’m worried about prison, but I have plenty of legal connections, so I could easily get out of this mess.

However, that won’t help me beat Karma, will it?

I don’t know how long I have. I just know that I’m going to die in the same way as that man.
