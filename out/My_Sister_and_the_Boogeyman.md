I want to be clear, I remember this happening. Regardless of anything else, I believe in my heart of hearts that this happened. 

I woke up in the middle of the night to look at my window. My body felt like it was morning, but it was still dark out. My eyes fluttered and I could make out, across from me, a small glow on my side. I turned, and on the other side of the nightstand, Izzy was gripping her security flashlight and muttering to herself. 

“‘Is okay Sophiie, if we keep the light on then it will be okay. I won’t let him get you this time.” 

I groaned. Sharing a bedroom with my sister didn’t feel like it used to be hard, but the gap between six and ten felt bigger now. 

“Izzy,” I groaned. I tapped the alarm clock/white noise machine between us and saw that it was after one in the morning, “Go to sleep. It’s late. We got school tomorrow.”

“I can’t,” Sophie said, “The Boogeyman is coming tonight.” 

I threw myself down on my bed and covered my face with my pillow. I wanted to scream. 

“One, the Boogeyman is not real. Two, Sophie is not real either, so even if he was real… I wouldn’t trust your imaginary friend about it.” 

“Freddie V told me the Boogeyman came to his house and ate his dog. He said that when the Boogeyman eats things, he eats everything. He doesn’t leave anything behind. ” 

“Yeah well I know Freddie V’s brother and he never had a dog,” I retorted, “And even if he did, Freddie V and his brother are both assholes.” 

“You shouldn’t say that,” Izzy called out. 

“His brother called me worse,” I said, and it was true and he’s still an asshole, “Trust me, and trust me Freddie V has probably said worse than that. Either way, you shouldn’t trust those morons and you shouldn’t trust ‘Sophie,’ and we should go to sleep.” 

“Don’t be mean to Sophie,” Izzy said, "Sophie told me you used to be friends, and she’s scared.”

“Yea, why?” 

“Because the Boogeyman got her once, and she doesn't want him to come again.”

“...go to sleep.” 

I rolled over, pressing the pillow over my head, hoping that I had the final world. Izzy stayed silent, and for a moment I thought I could actually will myself to sleep. But I made the mistake of turning and catching a glimpse of my sister still sitting up, cradling the flashlight. 

I sighed, “Okay, let’s be reasonable,” a phrase my STEM teacher used, “Say the Boogeyman is real and he eats kids and he even ate Freddie V’s dog… wouldn’t we have heard a news story about a dog being eaten? Wouldn’t we hear about kids vanishing into closets or under beds.”

"Mommy got that text about that kid who went missing,” said Izzy. 

“Yeah, but that was just like their dad took them. Like mommy said the kid was in a silver car. Do you think the Boogeyman drives a silver car?” 

“...maybe…” 

“No, Izzy,” I chastised, “No because that would be stupid. And the Boogeyman is stupid and Freddie V is stupid and this is all stupid and you need to just go to sleep.” 

“Okay,” Izzy said sadly, turning off her flashlight. 

“Goodnight,” I said, but soon I just heard her start sobbing

“Ugh,” I groaned, “Do you need me to sleep with you or what?”

“Mhm,” Izzy whimpered.. 

“Jesus, fine, okay.” 

I slipped out of bed and felt my bare foot step on a lego, “Crap.” 

I leaned over to switch on the lamp. When I did, I saw two massive, spiny, gray arms with long and boney fingers lingering over my sister, the fingers bent like massive jaws ready to grab their prey.

I froze, the fingers seeming to pulse, ready to strike like two copperheads.

“What’s wrong?” Izzy asked. 	I didn’t know what to say. I slowly moved forward and reached for Izzy’s hand. I squeezed tight.

“Nothing’s the matter, Izzy,” I said, trying to steady her voice, “I just want you to come into my bed. Okay..”

Izzy was still, I could tell she knew I was scared. I couldn’t stop staring at the purple veins that flowed under the skin of the large arms, and the dried brown flakes underneath its massive claws. The weird part is that I didn’t feel shock or surprise. I felt like this had happened before. 

“Izzy, ya gotta listen to me,” I said, seeing one of the fingers twitch. 

“GO!” I screamed, and I grabbed my sister’s wrists and yanked her back, pulling her backwards as I fell back onto my twin bed.. I grabbed Izzy by the nightgown, but one of the arms jolted out from under Izzy’s bed. 

The massive hand grasped Izzy’s torso, her neck and head fitting right between its fingers as its claws dug into her nightgown. 

“Izzy!” I screamed as I planted my ass into the bed and pulled back, trying to get her out of it. I can remember her screaming my name. 

“Manny, Manny,” Izzy cried out desperately. 

“No, no, no,” I sobbed as I felt Izzy’s small hand slip out of my grasp. I watched in horror as Izzy was yanked sharply under the bed. 

Before I could even react to what happened to Izzy, another hand shot out to grab me. 

I threw myself to the foot of the bed to avoid the grasp. I leapt off of the bed, but tripped as another shot from under Izzy’s bed. I scrambled to my feet and grabbed a chair. I swung around and tossed it hard at the hand as it tried to grab me like it had grabbed Izzy. Then I charged out of the room, my shoulder slamming into the hallway wall.  

“Mommy! Daddy!” I screamed

I charged down the hallway, praying that it wasn’t too late for Izzy. I barreled into my parents’ room and started violently shaking my sleeping dad's shoulders.  

“Daddy! Daddy! Wake up! It’s Izzy! The Boogeyman’s got Izzy.”

Dad shot up, groaned, and slowly rubbed my back, “Manny, relax, it’s okay. Come on.”

He gently jostled mom’s shoulder, “Louisa, come on. It happened again.”

I shook my head, “Please we gotta go! Daddy! We got to go help her… help… um… her we gotta help her…” 

“It’s alright,” said dad as he grabbed my hand and brought me back to the bedroom. I knew I should be scared, but he was so calm. 

I felt dizzy as I came back to my room. The twin beds were gone, replaced by a full bed that sat in the center of the room. There were no Barbie dream houses or little kid stuffies. Just trophies that I had won, photos of my friends, a desk that had not been there before. 

“What happened? Where’s her bed? Where’s her stuff?” 

“It’s okay,” dad said, “You just had a nightmare again…”

I nodded as I sat on the side of my bed, “I had a sister and the Boogeyman came and got her.”

Dad nodded, “I know honey. And I know it felt real… just like last time.” 

Mom followed in  with a glass of water and a melatonin gummy, “And honey, you know you don’t have a sister.” She sat next to me and wrapped her arms around me, “And you know the Boogeyman isn’t real.”

I exhaled, “I know, I know… I’m sorry she just felt real”

“We know,” dad said, “Do you want to sleep in our room or will you be okay?”

I chewed the gummy and took a sip of water, “I’ll be okay. I’m sorry.”

“Don’t be,” mom said, “That’s what we’re here for.”

I tucked myself back in and watched my parents slowly leave. 

And I know, I know. A teenage girl posts about her scary dream, but I don’t know. I’m not adding details. I remember all of this. I don’t remember anything else about this girl, this sister, Izzy, but I remember that night so clearly. I’ve written it down so many times so I don’t forget. 

Because here’s the thing, I’ve talked to my mom and dad about it and they said that Izzy was an imaginary friend, I had a few imaginary friends apparently. They weren’t always called Izzy though. No, before that I had another imaginary sister who I cried about being eaten by the Boogeyman. 

Her name was Sophie. 

And the last thing I remember of that night was looking at that flashlight rolled into the corner and echoing in my ears the words of my sister–real or not. 

When the Boogeyman eats things, he eats everything.
