I’m a creature of habit. I have the same routine every night while in the bathroom: I used the toilet, took a shower, shaved, took out my contacts, and brushed my teeth. But it was during this last step when I heard a strange sound. 

*Gurgle gurgle gurgle*

It was coming from my sink, or so I thought. But honestly, it was late and I had a long day, so I didn’t have the energy to investigate it. Shaking my head, I quickly finished brushing my teeth and headed to bed.

The next morning I thought that it was a dream. I looked at the sink that morning, but nothing was unusual. I shrugged. The memory was fading away, so I just thought it was a dream.

I went about my business as usual that day, quickly forgetting what had happened the previous night. But that night, as I went back into the bathroom, I heard that noise again.

*Gurgle gurgle gurgle*

Suddenly, I remembered the previous night. A dream was only occasional for me, but two nights of the same dream in a row? I lightly slapped my cheek. My hand felt real, and so did the pain. Feeling brave, I punched my counter. It was real, alright. I clutched my hurt hand, and headed off to shower. For a moment, I could have sworn I heard something. Not a sound, but a thin, raspy voice. 

*Feed…me…*

I shook my head. There’s nothing in the sink. What could even fit down there? I took my shower, straining my ears to see if I could hear anything over the roaring water. No luck.

I started shaving, mindlessly going through the familiar motions that I repeated each night to be presentable. Suddenly, in the middle of cutting my left cheek, that strange sound came from below.

*Gurgle gurgle gurgle*

In a panic, my head twitched and my razor cut me. “Shit!” I shouted. Sighing, I looked into the mirror to assess the damage. It wasn’t a deep cut, which was fortunate.However, it did start to bleed quickly, and as I looked at the cut it dripped down the side of my chin and a drop fell. Startled, I quickly rushed to my closet and grabbed a bandaid. I quickly put it on, covering the cut so that it didn’t bleed anymore.

Relaxing, I returned to the sink. I picked up the razor, but I noticed something. There wasn’t any blood on it. Looking into the sink, the drop that fell from my face had disappeared. I looked up to the mirror, and the streak blood was still on my face. I watched as it gathered into a tiny drop and fell into the sink. 

I reached and grabbed a tissue to clean my face off, and when I looked back the drop was gone. My eyes caught some movement down the drain, though. I wasn’t sure but it almost looked like a tentacle was slowly moving down the sink.

The voice came back, stronger now. As if it was dying of thirst and had just drunk from a bottle of water. 

*Feed me. More*

I stared in horror. “Wha…what are you?” my voice replied shakily.

*More*

That was its only response. Horrified, I realized what it meant. “Y…you…” I struggled to say, “…want blood.” 

*Give. Now*

Scared, I could barely think straight. Disgusted and afraid of the thing, I began to back away from the sink, saying, “No.”

As soon as the words left my mouth, black tentacles shot out of the drain towards me. They wrapped around my head and my neck, impossibly strong and pulling me closer to the drain. I couldn’t pull against the tentacles, and I tried to rip them apart with my hands, but more of them shot out and pulled my hands apart. 

My eyes now above the drain, I could sort of see what was inside. A black, gooey mess lay in my drain, with a maw of what looked like thousands of teeth opened up. When it spoke, it was with a voice of fury, of one that would not be denied.

***FEED ME. NOW***

I thought this was where I was going to die. My hands flat against the counter, trying to pull my head back as it was being pulled to the creature. But then my hand felt something. 

Before I realized what I was doing, I grabbed the thing. Suddenly, on its own accord, my hand slashed at the tendrils holding my left hand. The thing cut the tentacles like butter, and the creature howled like a wounded dog. My hand slashed at the tentacles around my right hand and head without me even realizing, and before I knew it I was slamming what looked like a knife down the drain.

An unearthly shriek came out of the drain. The sound pierced through my skull, rattling my head and my entire body. My brain was frozen, but my body started acting of its own accord. I grabbed basic toiletries, and ran out of the bathroom. I threw as much as I could fit in my suitcase as tentacles slid from around the bathroom door. I ran out of my apartment just as the tentacles crushed the bathroom door and rushed at me. I slammed the front door shut and ran out of the building.

I’m currently living in a hotel, looking for another apartment to live in. There wasn’t anything about what happened that night in the news. I still had the knife, which I have never seen before and I’m not sure how it got there. I know it’s ornate and I could sell it for money, but something tells me that I want to keep it on me. Hopefully I can get over my fear of bathroom sinks soon.
