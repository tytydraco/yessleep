I never understood why tiredness feels like shame.
“It’s just sleep,” people say. Go to bed earlier. Less phone. No caffeine after 4 p.m.
I nod, smile, say things like “Yeah, I should,” while knowing I’ll be lying awake again, like someone flipped a switch inside me that only works one way.

Mornings are the quietest. No traffic, no voices, just the fridge hum, sometimes the heating clicking. I sit in the kitchen and stare at steam over my mug until the tea goes cold. The table has a pale scratch across the middle, angled like a razor mark. I run my thumb over it just to feel it’s real.

I work in an office emails, spreadsheets, calendars nobody can align. On my way there I count seams between paving stones and streetlights. At the corner, a pharmacy window changes numbers on its promo posters. Same font, same colors, just a new number. I didn’t care at first. Then I caught myself waiting for those numbers the way someone waits for a song on the radio.

Sleep stopped being “bad.” It just wasn’t there. I fell unconscious, then woke dry mouthed, heart racing, like I’d been sitting in a windowless room. No nightmares, no images. Just blank wakefulness.

Doctors said “sleep maintenance insomnia.” They said “routine,” “hygiene,” blackout shades, light timers. I tried each thing alone to see what worked. Nothing did. After a while I stopped talking about sleep at all. Complaining about it feels like complaining you have to breathe.

One wet afternoon I stopped at a bus shelter where a flyer slapped against the glass in the wind. “Sleep therapy  new method no medication.” A number, an address. No clinic name. I snapped a photo. It felt like writing a stranger’s number on a coaster you’ll never call.

That night I was awake at 3:12 a.m. Pointless to keep my eyes shut. I picked up my phone, the flyer photo lit up, like it had been waiting. I dialed.

“You’re having trouble sleeping,” the voice said.
“Yeah.”
“We can help. But you have to commit.”
“What does that mean?”
“Come tomorrow. 5 p.m.” He gave the address. Then silence, as if sound had been cut from the room.

The building was on a side street I’d never noticed. No sign downstairs, just a buzzer labeled “Therapy.” A woman’s voice crackled: “Third floor.” The stairwell smelled of stone and dust. She opened the door thin, gray sweater covered in tiny pills. “Good day. Have a seat.” The hallway was narrow, humming faintly behind the last door.

Inside: no doctor’s office clutter, no pictures, no plants. Just a single armchair, a side table with water, a floor lamp shaded dark on the outside, white on the inside. A door I hadn’t seen slid open and a man entered mid forties, neat, unreadable. He shook my hand, warm but not soft. 
“Glad you’re here. Please sit.”

The chair was firmer than I expected, fitting my back like a car seat. He sat low, clipboard on his lap. “You may not notice yourself falling asleep. That’s fine. You might hear humming or a click. Ignore it. If images come, let them pass. No resistance.” He glanced at my clenched hands. “Let them go.”

Above me a panel glowed with tiny dots so small they looked like flaws in the ceiling. He adjusted the headrest, leaned close, voice level: 
“Everything ends at three.”

I turned my head. “What do you mean?”
“Breathe,” he said. Patient, practiced.

He pressed something in the corner. The hum deepened. The lights blurred. My mouth went dry, metallic on my tongue.


I don’t know how much time passed. The lamp was on, the room unchanged, but the air pressure felt different. The woman stood in the doorway, hands clasped like she was cold. 
“You can go now.” Too smooth, too quick.

The man was gone. My neck stiff, I asked, “How long?”
“It’s fine,” she said. “The first time is disorienting.” She handed me my jacket, though I remembered hanging it myself. Outside it was already dark. My phone buzzed: 10:47 p.m.

Walking home, my legs felt heavier, streets brighter, city tilted slightly away from me.
The next night was… ordinary. I still woke, but not with the same violent snap. Sometimes dull pain is enough.

I didn’t mention it at work. I laughed at jokes, nodded at shows I never watch. My desk is neat pen right, glass left, monitor tilted back so I don’t see my reflection. I hate that.

The second appointment was the same room, same dots in the ceiling. He asked, “Headache? Nausea?” I shook my head. He tucked a blanket over my knees. “Breathe.” The hum came quicker this time. I thought of milk. Because you can’t think of nothing.

When I opened my eyes the room was empty. My foot was asleep. The woman smiled. “See you next week.” No scheduling. Like it was already set.

The days slid by smooth as train cars. Wake, shower, coffee, work. Grocery shopping: basket always the same order milk, rice, cans, bread, fruit, eggs. But when I reached for milk, one was already there. Same brand. Same cap. I couldn’t remember putting it in. Someone coughed behind me, polite. 
I bought both.

At home everything went in its place. Always. Otherwise the apartment feels like it’s watching. My toothbrush was missing from its cup, lying wet in the sink. I told myself I was in a hurry earlier. 
I moved on.

That night I met two acquaintances in a narrow bar, glasses reeking faintly of cleaning solution. “Sleeping any better?” one asked.
“So, so.”
He grinned, drained his beer, left a wet ring on the table. “It’ll be fine,” he said. “In the end everything ends at three.”
I stared. “Sorry?”
He laughed. “Just a saying. No idea where I got it.” He spun his glass in the ring, like tracing it.

On the bus home, the city slid past. Shop windows mirrored me as if I were someone else. A kid sat across, legs too short for the floor, staring out. Slowly, its head turned toward me, like pulled on strings. It wasn’t a casual look. It was an evaluation. I raised my eyebrows “You okay?” The kid opened its mouth, then shut it. Put a finger to its lips. “Shh,” it whispered, barely audible, and turned back to the window.

My hands started sweating.

I began writing things down short notes, what was where, when I got up, when I felt tired. I wanted to prove there was a rhythm. I like rhythms. They’re little lies that organize the world.
