Part (1)

My name is Talib, and I have been admitted to a psychiatric ward here in Winter Haven, FL. It has been 3 years since I’ve been admitted by the state here as a permanent resident and I think now is a perfect time to tell everyone why.

 I first started working at South Florida Baptist Hospital when I was 23 years old, I lost my grandma at 18, She was the last bit of family that I had left after my parents died in a car accident and when she passed, I was truly alone. I had to support myself and ended up ditching school and hopped around from Job to Job, after a few years I landed an interview at the South Baptist Hospital that my parents were treated at. I told myself I would never set foot in that hospital again, but with no one to fall on I was left with no other choice. The job was simple. I was a Support Technician; I was tasked with cleaning the hospitals six-floors and maintaining a professional attitude with Patients and Other staff members. But 5 months into the job I really started to hate it, cleaning after Doctors and Nurses who act like you don’t exist and even the thought of your parents passing away in the same hospital didn’t help with what I was going through. I never really recovered after their accident, even having my grandma support me I still felt alone, scared of what would become of me, when she passed away. My fears were reality.

The days were long and with the responsibility of cleaning the hospital by yourself can be boring but when done right the day can easily fly. I was about to leave when I got a call from my boss saying that a few rooms needed some clean sheets on the sixth floor. Our Linen guy had to leave early so I was stuck finishing his job with the promise of an hour of comp time. I grabbed a cart and headed to the elevator. Crammed like a pencil in a new pack, I was finally free at my stop. After traversing through what seemed like a traffic jam on I-4. I Finally placed the linen cart in a corner adjacent of the hallway. Turning back around an older lady was waving her hand and calling me over from one of the rooms. Usually, our job prohibits us from talking to patients ensuring that we are not liable for upsetting them or when they hurt themselves, but nobody was helping her so why not? I walked to the room. “Yes ma’am?” “Hey honey do you mind if I can get an extra blanket, please?” she asked. I smiled and turned to the cart grabbing a blanket out the cart and making my way back placing it gently at her feet. “Would you like me to cover you?' I asked “Ahh yes Dear”.

While unfolding the blanket I caught a glimpse of my hands, covered in blood shocked I looked up and was looking at my deceased grandmother as blood streamed from her mouth and onto the floor in the living room holding her in my arms, Feeling her fleeting presence wandering away. I placed my head on to her chest crying and mumbling to myself “I’m sorry… I’m sorry”, “sorry for what dear?” I was back in the room still holding onto the blanket preparing to place it over her legs, I hurried and covered her apologizing “I’m sorry miss...”  Seeing her has been a new normal occasion for me and I can never understand why I was plagued with seeing my grandmother in such a horrible state. Embarrassed by looking like a creep I was hoping she would just thank me and let me go but I was wrong." My name is Clara I hope I’m not keeping you dear, but you seemed troubled do you want to talk for a while?” I couldn’t say no and by the looks of it she didn’t have many visitors, this usually happens to a lot of our patients, and I felt sorry for her, So I stayed, and I tried to keep to myself the best I could.

For the next hour I got to know Clara. She was 46 years old and had a Total Knee Replacement and was stuck here for the next 6 weeks for recovery, we talked about everything, and I was in complete shock when finding out that she had just lost her son in a car accident a year ago. We couldn’t help but relate losing the people that we loved. She was incredibly wise and gave me advice on some of the stuff I was struggling with. She honestly made me happy and felt seen, So every day after my shift I would pay her a visit and talk with her for hours. Weeks went by, and she was moving through her recovery in high spirits and before we even knew it. It was her last day as a patient.

 I promised her that I would see her off at four thirty. She was being transferred out at five o’clock, so I had a thirty-minute gap to go to the gift shop. I started heading to her room patiently waiting for the elevator doors to open I stepped off and started to walk to her room, going around concerned parents and nurses. I stopped feeling the hairs on my neck stand. The air was thin feeling my body shake with fear as this lanky man walked past me towering over the heedless groups of people. It walked with no urgency, taking his hands out of his pockets revealing stained hands rubbing them together as red flakes fell to the daisy-colored floor. I started to follow not only was this guy creepy, but he was heading towards Claras’ room. I Picked up the pace trying to go around the figure, but a nurse bumped right into me spilling a tray of food all over me and her. I tried to apologize but looking ahead I noticed a shadow going into Claras’ room I ran squeezing through families and dodging wet hazardous signs placing my hand on the frame of the door I froze.

The figure was injecting an EpiPen into her leg. Hearing Clara cry out for help, but with no remorse the creature kept stabbing. I didn’t know what to do, but it wasn’t stopping, stabbing two more EpiPens in the same leg. “GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM HER!” I yelled, it turned to me looking dead in my eyes and smiled.  I couldn’t move, in a desperate act to save her I summoned every ounce of courage I had and rushed the tall fucker screaming for it to stop. I woke up, my head pounding, feeling the side of my head pressed against the floor by the security guardsI tried to move my hands but they were bound. Pleading to let me go, I cried out “IT WASN’T ME!” “HE DID THIS, YOUR LETTING HIM GET AWAY!” I tried to look up seeing four nurses attempting to resuscitate Clara as she shook violently on the bed, I was forced to stand up and was dragged from the room I couldn’t look away. I saw my friend slowly die in front of me hearing the sound of her heart Vach machine ring down the hallway. she was dead, and I was blamed.

Due to being in the room alone with the Clara I was taken into custody and questioned by the police on the events of her death and an investigation began I tried to tell them that there was someone else in the room. I swore up and down but couldn’t give a full description. No one remembered seeing a lanky guy with red-stained hands walking around the hospital. They thought I was insane., The story started hitting headlines, The top story?   “A Support Technician Murders Patient!”. Although with the lack of physical evidence Tieng me to injecting Clara with a deadly amount of Epinephrine. The case went cold. Two days later I was let go of my job.

After everything I had worked for washed away by the media and accusations of me murdering my friend, I struggled to find work and fell behind on my rent. I was soon back to square one. Unable to support myself I started living in the woods behind the hospital. Laying up against the tree holding the Card I had picked out for Clara I couldn’t help but replay that awful day in my mind. I can't help but feel like she was just the beginning of something terrible. I have to stop him, I can't let anyone else be the victim of that horrible smile.
