I was at a friend's apartment yesterday for a 4/20 party. It was Easter, and we were planning on getting "high on the holy spirit", if you catch my drift. As the party got more, relaxed, several of us were chilling on my friend's balcony when another friend of mine said something about one of the party members that I didn't know too well. For the sake of not getting a strike or something from Reddit, I'll not go too into detail as to how I responded, but this comment resulted in me telling a really bad joke.

Call it false confidence from how blazed I was, but I really misjudged the situation and let out what was obviously a really offensive statement, trying to get a laugh from those present. It was so apparently offensive that two of the people hanging with us left the balcony, and my friend, Max wouldn't really talk to me afterward.

I should have said I'm sorry, I really should have, because I do regret telling that joke. Not just because what followed, but because I realize how offensive it was in hindsight. Maybe if I said I was sorry right away, it wouldn't have started.

Soon after the silence resulting from my attempt at humor set in, so did the sound of clapping. It was slow and steady. Sarcastic, but overly so. There were several, glaring seconds between each clap. I got the idea that someone really wanted to hammer home how offensive it was and make me feel awful. I looked inside the apartment from the balcony doorway, but only saw angry faces of those guests who were relayed my statement by those who had left right after I told it.

Why didn't I say I was sorry?

"Can't take a joke?" I said looking at the crowd.

The clapping persisted. More rapid this time, it was also getting louder.

"Okay you don't have to be so sensitive." I whispered, grabbing my coat.

I was angry, high, and of course, embarrassed.

I stormed out of the apartment. I live down the block so walking home wouldn't be difficult. At first, I had thought the clapping had stopped. However, that same steady, slow applause continued

"Max?" I said turning around.

No one was there, despite the sound continuing to fill the night around me.

At first I thought it may be in my head, I was high after all. Maybe I'm just hearing things and I'm too baked to know it's not real. It felt like real sound though. It wasn't like I was thinking about the sound of clapping. I was hearing it ring in my ears the same way the music at the party I was at did.

I took off running. The sound followed me as I ran. I quickly unlocked my apartment, got inside, slammed the door, and was sure to make clear that it was locked behind me. There was what I thought was silence for a moment, but quickly realized was a moment of distraction. For after I regained composure and took a sigh of relief in my apparent safety, the clapping started again. Louder and more rapid, that din persisted to fill my head.

"I need to sleep this off" I thought. There had to be something in that weed. I shut myself in my bedroom, hopped into bed, and closed my eyes. I didn't bother getting undressed, I needed the noise to stop.

Soon, I fell unconscious. Sleep took me and the noise halted. I slept for so long, but my relief was short-lived. I awoke earlier this afternoon and the sound was even louder, even more rapid. It is a full on thunderous applause now. I think I even hear cheering, laughing maybe?

I don't know what to do.

I don't think I'm still high, but I really don't know what I feel anymore.

I have a headache typing this out and now I'm beginning to see things. I think I see who is clapping. He is right next to me. The room is empty if I turn around, but I can barely see his face if I look quickly in the corners of my eyes.

I can see him smiling, clapping, silently laughing.



He looks like me.
