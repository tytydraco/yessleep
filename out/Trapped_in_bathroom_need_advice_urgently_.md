I moved to my house a week or two ago by myself for my new job. It’s in a pretty decent sized neighborhood so I was very suprised the first few days when I didn’t see a single other person. I mean I thought the whole neighborhood was abandoned besides me, there were no cars passing through, no kids playing in yards, I’m telling you I thought it was empty.

Then I looked out my window on the 3rd or maybe it was the 4th night since I moved in and saw a guy in the yard of the house across the street just raking the grass at 11:45 at night. There weren’t any leaves or anything he was just raking his empty yard. I watched for a moment or two and then decided to mind my own business and let it slip my mind.

The next day after my first day at my new job I came back to my house and when I went to unlock the door, it strangely was already unlocked, which was odd since I was positive that I had locked it with my new key when I left. I shrugged it off and assumed I remembered wrong and went to my kitchen to make dinner, then found that a few of my cupboards were open, which I didn’t remember opening. I shrugged that off too and went to bed, which I thought I remembered that I had made in the morning but I guess I didn’t after all. When I turned out the lights I looked out the window again and saw the same guy raking imaginary leaves in his yard, at 12:30 this time. I stared for a while but he turned around suddenly and I had to duck down under the window quickly so he wouldn’t see me snooping, that’s when I noticed a strange key on the floor I hadn’t seen before, I ignored the key and peered out the window again and he was already back to raking so I went to bed.

The next day when I came back, my front door was unlocked again, even though this time I knew I had unlocked it. My refrigerator was open in the kitchen too and my shower was running. I was really creeped out, but I couldn’t really remember closing my fridge after making breakfast, and I couldn’t really remember turning off the shower this morning and I couldn’t remember locking the door either, so I just accounted it to having to leave for work in a hurry. I went to brush my teeth and was suprised to find another weird key on my bathroom sink, I didn’t know what it was for and I didn’t remember noticing it earlier. In the hall I noticed another key on the ground too. I figured maybe the last person to live here broke their keychain when they were moving furniture out and didn’t realize it or something. 

When I went up to bed, this time at 3 in the morning I saw that dude again with his rake. I just stood at the window staring, I was kind of tired and zoned out, just wondering what he was doing that for when all of a sudden he jerked his head around and looked at me. I ducked under my window but not fast enough and after a minute or two when I peeked out again he was still staring directly at me, making eye contact. I didn’t know what to do so I just waved, but he didn’t wave back. I went back downstairs to double check the door was locked and then came back up to my bedroom and locked that door too before going to sleep. 

The next day I was really tired from staying up late and I fell asleep at work. When I woke back up the office was empty, the lights were out, and everyone had gone home. It was about 6pm. I went back to my house and got there right as the sun was going down and I found my front door open. Nothing in my house had been moved but the door was open. I was so sleepy that I went right up to my bedroom but when I opened the bedroom door, the guy was standing there waiting for me, his back to the window I had been watching him from, just fucking standing there waiting for me. 

I froze not knowing what to do and asked him if he was ok, and instead of answering, he lurched after me. I turned to run and made it to my bathroom across the hall, and before I closed the door to lock myself in, I turned around and saw him stumbling after me, hunched over and vomiting of hundreds of keys out of his mouth.

I’m locked in here now and I don’t know what to do, I hear him out there looking thought the keys on the ground that he vomited, trying to find the one to my bathroom. I think he’s eating the keys as he picks them up. He keeps scraping the rake on the door and laughing too. What should I do? I could try to jump out the window but he would hear and I would definitely break something. I have my car keys in my pocket but I don’t know if I could jump and then get to my car with a broken leg before that guy comes down the stairs and gets me. What should I do?
