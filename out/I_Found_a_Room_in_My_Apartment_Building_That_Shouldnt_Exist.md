It began with a flickering light in the hallway on the fourth floor. I live on the fifth, but the building is old and strange things happen, so I didn’t think much of it at first. But then I noticed that every time I passed that floor, the bulb was off. No flicker, just completely dead. 

One night, curiosity got the better of me. 

I took the stairs instead of the elevator and stopped outside door 4B. The hallway was unnaturally quiet. No hum from the ceiling vents, no creaking pipes, no distant dog barking. Just me and that one blackened bulb above. I reached into my pocket, pulled out my phone, and turned on the flashlight. 

That’s when I noticed something strange. 

Directly across from 4B, where there had always been a blank wall, there was now a door. 

No label. Solid wood. A dusty bronze knob. The kind of door that looked like it had been there for decades, even though it hadn’t. 

I’ve lived here for three years. 

I know every part of this building. 

I stood there frozen for a while. 

Then, like an idiot in a horror movie, I reached out and turned the knob. It clicked open easily, too easily, like the door had been waiting for me. 

The room was small. 

Square. Bare concrete walls and no windows. But the air felt like it was moving, like the whole place was breathing. The smell was metallic, and I realized my flashlight was flickering even though my battery was full. 

Then I saw it. 

On the far wall. A mirror. Not hung, not leaning. Embedded. Perfectly flush with the concrete like it had been grown into the wall. It was tall, maybe seven feet, and the surface looked like glass smeared with ash. I approached it slowly. 

When I stood in front of it, my reflection wasn’t. 

. . right. 

It moved slightly out of sync with me, like a delay on a livestream. 

I raised my hand. It did too, but a second late. I smiled. It didn’t. It stared. 

Then it tapped the glass. 

I heard it. 

A soft, deliberate tap tap tap. 

. . from the other side. 

I stepped back, heart pounding, and the reflection stepped forward, closing the gap. 

Then it smiled. 

I ran out of the room, slammed the door, and sprinted up the stairs to my apartment. 

I didn’t sleep. The next morning, I went back. 

The door was gone. Just that blank wall again.

No paint scratches, no bolt marks, no sign it had ever been there.

I asked my neighbor in 4B if he’d noticed anything strange. He said, “There is no 4B. That unit’s been sealed off since the fire.”

“What fire?” I asked.

He just stared at me like I was insane and shut the door.

I checked with the building manager. There was a fire. Ten years ago. Unit 4B had been gutted. No one had lived there since.

I don’t walk past that hallway anymore. I take the elevator, every time. But sometimes, just before the doors close, I see that same bulb flickering again. And it looks a little dimmer every time.

Like something is trying to find its way out.
