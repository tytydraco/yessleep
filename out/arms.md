Actually, from the very moment someone turns their back and leaves you behind, the story has already ended forever. No matter how much you cling or how they might come back, it no longer carries any meaning to continue that old story.

The moment someone leaves—that moment is forever. It’s the conclusion of all the days before, whether they were filled with happiness or pain, youth or obsession. You must accept that truth.

Everything that happens afterward is a new chapter of life. A completely new story, and now, you are the one holding the pen to write it. So after that turning point, you must carefully think about how to write your story anew.

I remember the day you left my life, saying we wouldn’t stay in touch like before, wouldn’t go places together like we used to. It felt like my heart was etched with a deep scar. In that moment, I felt breathless, my chest ached in the way those old romance novels or Korean dramas used to describe. I used to think those stories exaggerated things—until I experienced that pain myself.

The days that followed were filled with torment and misery. I struggled to find an ending for myself, unaware that the ending had already been there all along—I just hadn’t accepted it yet.

As time passed slowly, it gave me enough clarity to look back and realize I was beginning a new chapter of my life. That person’s turning away was the permanent end to the previous story. From now on, I am the only one who gets to decide and write my new story. A blank page has been opened. Will I be the one who wallows in sorrow, endlessly longing for someone who has already left, or will I be the one hoping they’ll go far away and eventually realize my worth and return? How ridiculous it is to write my new story that way, isn’t it?

When you hold the pen of destiny in your hands, every stroke you write should bring brightness to yourself. Someone from the past who no longer cherishes you—why drag them along through the long journey ahead? That relationship might have been meaningful in its own way, or maybe they had their own struggles when making that decision. But ultimately, it still means you weren’t important enough in their life. So, in this new chapter, treat them as just another passerby from the past. No need to give them the top position they once held. No need to let them occupy every corner of your mind like before. Instead, write things that are good for yourself. Write a future where no one can cause you pain. Live a life that doesn’t depend on anyone anymore.

There will come a time when you realize how precious tears and love truly are. So save them for someone deserving—and the one most deserving is yourself.

In this new chapter, I hope you forget that old departure, the broken promises, the warmth that no longer comforts, and the sincerity that wasn’t appreciated. Leave all of that on the previous page. Moving forward, write more about happiness.
