*I look out of the window at the pile of rubble where my new neighbours' house stood a few days ago.*

*You have no idea what I'm talking about? No, of course you don't, nobody does. There's no news, no mention in the papers, nothing. As if it never happened, but I know what I saw and what I experienced. But let me explain.*

*My name is San Tacket and it all started two weeks ago.*

*It was a day like any other, I looked out of the kitchen window without thinking and saw a removal van parked in our street. I was curious to see who would be moving into our street. I could see that there were 2 people, a boy in a wheelchair and a woman who was probably his mother. As I had nothing to do at the moment and wanted to make a good impression on the new neighbours, I decided to go over and ask if I could help in any way.*

*Now that I think about it, I probably should have just stayed in the house and done nothing. Maybe none of this would have happened. Well, I went over and introduced myself: "Hello \*I said nicely\* I was watching the removal van from the kitchen window and saw boxes being dragged into the house. I wanted to introduce myself and see if I could help. As it seems we are neighbours now, I wanted to see if I could be of any help". \*The woman said, "Oh, that's so sweet of you. There aren't many kids your age with that much respect these days, if it's not too much trouble could you help carry the boxes into the house then I can look after my son" I said "Yes, no problem" and so I helped carry the boxes into the house. Together we managed to empty the van. The mother thanked me afterwards and I went home.*

*It was now 6pm and I just wanted to lie down on the sofa and relax for the rest of the evening, so I turned on the TV and saw the last few minutes of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. So that's how the evening went, I was sitting on the couch, actually just scrolling through my feed on Instagram. I must have fallen asleep, because when I looked at the clock it was already 11pm. I tiredly got into bed and fell asleep, but I was jolted awake when I suddenly heard a scream. It sounded like it was coming from the house where the new tenants had moved in. I went to the window in the kitchen and looked out at the house, but I couldn't see anything strange. I thought I must have imagined it and went back to bed. The sun shone through my window onto an empty plate that was still on my desk and woke me up, so I got up, went into the kitchen and made myself a sandwich.*

*As usual, I looked through the kitchen window, but this time I saw the boy in the wheelchair peeking out from behind the glass and looking straight at me. My blood froze in my veins, it felt like he was looking straight into my soul. I don't know what it was, but there was something about him that sent a chill down my spine. But I told myself that it was just my imagination and that he was just a normal boy and that there was nothing strange about him.*
