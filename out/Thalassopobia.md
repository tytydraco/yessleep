The wreck was first discovered by some cage divers off the coast of New Zealand. A massive ship, so huge they could see the tallest parts from hundreds of meters above where it rested on the seafloor. The structure was so huge that first they thought it was a building that had somehow sank beneath the waves.   
  
I was a member of an advanced diving team for the Australian government. We were sent to survey the wreckage and determine a possible origin. I thought this was quite odd as they usually would use an ROV for this type of work. The ship was missing the bow, leaving only a massive torn hole. It had a massive paddle wheel coming out of the stern. The whole of the remaining ship was around 90 meters in length. Once we had gotten close to the vessel, we decided to split off into two groups. Two of us would go around to the stern, while the remaining two would go to the hole that would give us direct access to the inside.  
  
I ended up going with Adrian to explore the interior. As we approached I began to feel an acute sense of dread. The hole in the hull was a gaping maw that almost seemed to be calling out to us. Despite my apprehension, we had a job to do. Adrian led the way as we descended into the wreck.  
  
A few meters inside the hole there was a massive rotting wall stretching from top to bottom. Adrian approached a hole in the wall and managed to squeeze through. I followed to find Adrian suspended unmoving in the water. After I tried and failed to get any sort of reaction out of him, I noticed his light shining at the floor, which was covered in a maroon organic substance that was unlike anything I had seen before. I apprehensively raised my own light so it could illuminate the entire space.  
  
The organic substance suffocated the entire space, which seemed to take up about half of the entire interior of the vessel. At first I couldn’t make out what the oddly shaped structures that lined the walls of the room were. As I kept looking, the horrible realization came to me. Their outstretched hands and faces frozen in wails of agony had the same appearance as the rest of the room, but these weren’t part of the construction of the ship. These were people, frozen trying to futilely claw their way out of their eternal tomb.  
  
The next thing I knew, I was being dragged upwards towards the surface. I was told later that the rest of our team found me and Adrian catatonic and had to drag us out of the wreckage. They didn’t get a good look at the room, so me and Adrian were the only ones who saw the bodies. After we were brought back up to the boat we were immediately told to leave over our radio. We all gave our reports about what we found, including the ghastly sight inside the boat, but never heard anything about a return expedition or any new information. We went home like nothing happened.  
  
That was when the dreams started.  
  
I felt the sudden cold cut through me like a knife. All I could see was a fuzzy blue haze. I instinctively paddled upwards and after a few seconds I had breached the surface. A vast ocean stretched out endlessly in every direction around me. Panic set in as I bobbed up and down with the waves. I was stuck treading water with miles of empty ocean below me and no land in sight.   
  
I eventually awoke and ended up brushing it off as nightmares from my experience in the wreck. The next night, it returned, except it was ever so slightly different. This would become the pattern. At first it appeared to be the same vast ocean as the night before. After taking a moment to get my bearings, I felt something beneath the surface. I experienced a brief flash of uneasy panic before calming down and examining the surface of the water.  
  
Dozens of massive earthen spires stretched out from the depths to just below the surface. I couldn’t see any origin, the structures only vanished into the murky blue. They stretched out under the waves as far as the eye could see. The dream lasted about as long as the previous one, and I still didn’t pay it much mind.  
  
The third dream came the next night. Again I was immersed in the waves of the vast ocean, but there was no sign of the mountains from my previous experience. It was only when I allowed myself to sink beneath the waves did I discover the new feature of this dream. Opening my eyes underwater produced little adverse effect, so I could observe my surroundings uninhibited. About 10 or so meters below me the seabed laid home to a massive reef unlike anything I had ever seen.  
  
The coral came in every shape and color I could imagine and many I could not. Perfect convex spirals that ascended towards the sunlight until they reached their apex, twisting horns weaving inward and outward through each other, bushes dotted with small red growths on the ends of their skeletal branches. It was like I had been transported to an alien world completely divorced from anything I could witness on earth.  
  
I swam around the rock and coral exploring the unusual reef for a while before coming across a large area that was covered in many deep holes that seemingly went deeper into the earth. I cautiously approached a strange growth that stood out among the perforated seabed. It seemed to be coming out of one of the holes and descending into another nearby. I reached out to touch its organic surface, and as soon as I made contact the thing began to slither deeper into the hole.  
  
I awoke in a cold sweat. Later that day Adrian ended up contacting me. He was convinced that something was being hidden from us and told me he was going to investigate the circumstances of the wreck himself. He’s stronger than me, I guess. I told him to keep me updated. After our conversation, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Adrian was neglecting to tell me something. It didn’t help that I could keep my mind off of the reef and the creature in my dream.  
  
Sure enough, another dream came the next night. I was back in the ocean, with no sign of the reef. I repeatedly dove beneath the waves looking for anything new, but as far as I could see it was the same as the first dream. Finally, I took a deep breath and exhaled bubbles of air into the water as I descended as far as I could into the blue.  
  
There was a deafening sound. A sound like a great iceberg collapsing into the waves under a great frozen cliff. I panicked and spun around helplessly. There was nothing but the eternal blue surrounding me. But the longer I looked, I began to realize that was not the case. There was something there,  a kilometer away from where I was suspended in fear. A massive serpentine body was just beyond my view, snaking around its gargantuan coils. The beast let out another deafening bellow and I began to move in the opposite direction.  
  
The leviathan was there too, writhing in the murky blue. Everywhere I turned the obscured visage of the monster awaited me. I was surrounded by an inconceivably massive beast with only the sound of its horrible calls and nowhere to run. I cried out, wasting all that was left of my limited oxygen.   
  
I wasn’t in the ocean, I was safe in my bed. None of it was real. The aquatic hell was a figment of my own twisted mind. The horrors of the vast ocean followed me into my waking hours. My thoughts were filled with alien coral and massive leviathans. As I stared into my morning coffee, I felt like I could almost see a wriggling serpent in the black liquid.  
  
Despite my desperate hopes, with the night came a new dream. This one, a true nightmare.  
  
Blackness. Complete and utter blackness with the burden of kilometers of water upon my back. I felt something brush against my leg, then again against my shoulder. Soon I was surrounded by tentacles and fins rubbing against me, their owners completely obscured in the inky darkness. The sounds that filled my ears penetrated to the deepest parts of my soul whilst still being completely incomprehensible.  
  
I was being suffocated by the whispering beings in the depths. A torture that only lasted a few minutes felt like an eternity. By the end of the experience I had run out of air and I could feel the creatures clawing at my gasping mouth as I drowned. At this point the voices were howling in my ears.  
  
The next thing I knew I was upright in my bed coughing my lungs out. I took a moment to get my bearings, I froze in shock staring at my sheets that were now soaked with seawater.   
  
Adrian had been having dreams too. My suspicions that caused me to call him right out of bed were correct. Something was happening to us. Adrian told me that he was going to take his boat out to the wreck during the day. I desperately pleaded with him not to go near that thing again, but his conviction wouldn’t budge. Adrian assured me that he would contact me with his findings the morning after.  
  
The entire day I felt like I was going insane. I was seeing things in reflections out of the corner of my eye and hearing soft whispers everywhere I went. It all came to a head when I tried to relax by taking a bath. As soon as I had eased back and closed my eyes I experienced the most horrific sensation. Something brushed by my leg in the water. I leapt out of the tub and stared into the water void of any semblance of life. I knew the feeling was genuine. There was something in there with me, I knew it.  
  
I tried to stay awake for as long as I could into the night, but despite my terrible apprehension I succumbed. When I came to, I was staring up at a black sky dotted with dozens of bright stars. I immediately realized that this time I wasn’t submerged in the waves. I was laying atop a meager slab of an all too familiar organic substance floating on the surface of the water. While a massive moon shone over the surface of the ocean, its pale light wasn’t enough to breach the surface and illuminate the depths.  
  
Soon the voices came. The voices from the depths, beckoning me from just beneath the surface. I wouldn’t dare follow their wishes, so the only thing I could do in the situation was endure. I sat there, bobbing up and down with the flow of the waves whose sounds became drowned out by the wailing voices for hours. Their cries only grew louder.   
  
After what I would guess was about forty hours of this unceasing torture, I couldn’t take it anymore. I gazed into the abyss, wondering what horrors awaited me there. The voices howled. They knew what was happening. They knew they were finally getting to me. This was my fate. I prepared myself to slide off of my miniscule sanctuary and into my watery grave. It was better than enduring any more of this torment.  
  
Right about as I was about to make the plunge, I was back in my bed. Part of me cursed the fact that I wasn’t able to end this whole thing right then and there, but I was glad I would be able to learn of Adrian's findings. I waited. And waited. And waited. Nothing but the twisting visage of impossible aquatic monsters in every reflection. Every attempt I made to contact Adrian failed. Apparently he was nowhere to be found.  
  
At the time I am writing this, I have been awake for 72 hours. I can’t take it anymore. The voices are now just as vivid in my waking hours as they are in my dreams. They keep calling to me. I can’t take it anymore. The bath I have drawn is almost full. This will serve as a record of everything I have gone through over this hellish week. I have accepted my inevitable fate. It’s time for me to face what’s waiting for me. It’s time for me to face the abyss.
