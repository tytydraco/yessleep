I used to love urban exploration.

Crumbling malls. Dead hospitals. Hollowed-out factories.

There’s something addicting about walking places that were supposed to be busy and alive—finding them gutted, forgotten, and still somehow breathing.

Me and my friend, Chris, had been planning this one for months.

The Red Fern Galleria.

Closed down in 2008 after a series of “unexplained structural issues.” Condemned. Fenced off. No one touched it since. Half the town whispered about it; the other half pretended it didn’t exist.

Perfect for us.

We got in through a service tunnel.

Flashlights cutting narrow tunnels through the dark.

The smell hit first—mold, copper, and something sour, like meat left out too long. I tried not to gag.

Inside, it was worse.

The floor tiles were warped and buckled like waves. Mannequins were melted to their stands. Dried vines curled up the escalators, reaching toward the broken skylights like dead hands.

No animals. No bugs.

No sound except for us.

Every now and then, Chris would call out a “Hello?”

His voice would disappear into the dark like a pebble tossed into a bottomless well.

We made it to the food court.

Tables overturned. Stale trays of uneaten food petrified in the ruins. A faded Cinnabon sign hanging by one rusted chain.

That’s when we heard it.

A faint scratching.

Not random.

Rhythmic.

Chris swung his light toward the noise.

Nothing.

We waited, breathless.

The scratching came again—closer this time.

Slow, deliberate, like something dragging its nails along concrete.

Then we heard it breathe.

A shallow, wet rasp, almost like a dog trying to growl with a crushed throat.

My flashlight flickered, and in that instant between light and dark, I saw it.

Low to the ground. Pale.

Long arms pressed tight to its sides. Elbows bent backwards like a spider’s legs. No hair. No clothes. Just stretched, mottled skin wrapped around a bony frame. Its mouth hung slack—jaw split wider than should’ve been possible—and its eyes were nothing but bulging, milky orbs.

It grinned at me.

And it was fast.

It scuttled up the side of a derelict Orange Julius stand like an insect. Hands slapping the walls, limbs bending wrong, mouth dragging ragged gasps of air.

Chris bolted.

I wasn’t far behind.

We sprinted through the dead mall, the thing chasing low and fast behind us, nails screeching against tile. Every time I glanced back, it was closer. Smiling. Clicking its broken teeth together like it was tasting the air.

We barreled into a department store—shelves collapsed, mirrors shattered.

Chris dove into a maintenance closet, yanking me in after him.

We killed the lights.

Sat in the pitch black, clutching each other’s arms like kids hiding from the monster under the bed.

We could hear it prowling just outside.

Scrape.

Shuffle.

Hhhhhhhuuuhh.

Scrape.

And then…something new.

A voice.

My voice.

It whispered my name, low and gurgling.

Over and over, dragging it out like it was savoring the taste.

“Jasonnnn…Jaaaassssoooonnn…”

Chris gripped my sleeve so tight it hurt.

The thing knew us.

It had seen us.

And somehow, it could become us.

Chris’s fingernails dug into my arm.

We stayed frozen in the dark, barely breathing.

The thing outside scraped slowly back and forth, dragging something heavy across the tiles.

Then it spoke again.

But not in my voice this time.

It was Chris’s.

“Jay…c’mon, man. We gotta move.”

His exact inflection. His cadence. Even the stupid little hitch he had when he was nervous.

Except…Chris was still gripping my arm. Still right beside me. Still whispering breathlessly:

“That’s not me.”

The voice outside giggled.

A sick, hollow noise, like a child trying to imitate laughter.

Then it said, again in Chris’s voice, “Jasonnn…I’m over here. You left me.”

Chris squeezed my hand tighter. “Don’t. Move,” he mouthed.

The scratching sound grew louder, more erratic.

It was hunting by sound.

Every muscle in my body screamed to bolt—but somehow, we stayed put.

Minutes—or hours, it felt like—passed.

The scraping eventually faded.

Chris risked cracking the maintenance door open an inch.

Darkness. Silence.

“We gotta find another exit,” he hissed.

I nodded, and we slipped out.

We kept low, ducking between toppled shelves and burnt-out kiosks.

The mall felt different. Wronger.

The architecture didn’t match what we’d mapped out online—hallways twisting in strange, impossible ways, storefronts repeating, signage written in gibberish.

At one point, we stumbled into an abandoned kids’ play area.

Swings hung from the ceiling by loops of black wire.

A carousel turned slowly by itself, though the air was dead still.

And that’s when we found the first sign of them.

A backpack.

Half-crushed under debris.

A dusty Polaroid camera poking out.

Chris grabbed it.

The film inside was fresh enough to still have photos.

He slid one out.

The photo showed four people—two men, two women—standing proudly in front of the very same cracked mall entrance we’d come through. Grinning. Middle fingers up at the “No Trespassing” sign.

Someone had scratched their faces out.

Beneath it, scrawled in shaky Sharpie, were three words:

“IT COPIES SMILES.”

Chris swore under his breath, shoving the photo away.

We kept moving.

Not long after, we found the rest.

A tattered sleeping bag. A broken GoPro.

A shoe, small and child-sized, tangled in rotten vines.

A trail of deep gouges in the floor, like someone had been dragged backward, clawing desperately.

Chris stopped dead ahead of me.

“Look.”

There, standing at the far end of the hallway, was me.

Same torn hoodie. Same blood-streaked face. Same wide, terrified eyes.

It lifted its hand—and waved.

Chris tightened his grip on the flashlight until it creaked.

“That’s not you,” he whispered.

Before I could respond, it grinned.

Not my smile. Not even close.

It was a rictus grin—impossibly wide, stretching ear to ear, splitting its skin into raw, glistening cracks. Rows and rows of too-small teeth.

It took a step toward us.

Then another.

Then ran.

Chris moved first.

He let out a raw, wordless yell and hurled the flashlight straight at the thing’s face.

The impact cracked against its forehead with a sickening thwack.

The creature stumbled, its head snapping back at an impossible angle, neck audibly popping.

But it didn’t fall.

It straightened—its grin somehow wider now—and lunged.

Chris swung a rusted metal pipe he must’ve grabbed without me noticing.

The blow connected.

The thing shrieked, this awful, high-pitched childlike wail that rattled my teeth.

“RUN!” Chris bellowed.

I didn’t need telling twice.

We tore down a side hallway—dim outlines of dead storefronts flashing by—but somehow, I was faster. Chris stumbled behind, cursing under his breath.

I hit a split in the corridor and whipped right without thinking.

Behind me—footsteps.

But not two sets.

One.

I skidded to a stop near what looked like a busted maintenance stairwell, heart hammering against my ribs.

“Chris?” I called into the dark.

No answer.

Just breathing.

Wet. Shuddering.

And then, from around the corner—my voice.

“Chris! Over here, man! Hurry!”

Except it wasn’t right.

The tone was off.

Too eager.

Too hungry.

I backed up, my heel clipping broken glass, heart about to detonate out of my chest.

That’s when Chris really rounded the corner—blood running down the side of his head, panting hard.

He stared at me.

I stared back.

Two Chris’s.

One limping, battered, clutching a real bleeding wound.

One standing perfectly still, eyes wide and glassy, smiling just a little too much.

Neither one moved.

“Jason,” the smiling one said. “We have to go.”

The other Chris gritted his teeth. “It’s that one!”

“Which one?!” I shouted.

Both reached out a hand.

Both said, at the exact same moment:

“Trust me.”

I stumbled back another step.

The thing that was pretending to be Chris took a tiny step forward, fingers twitching unnaturally—too many joints flexing under the skin, knuckles bending sideways.

And then its face twitched.

The smile cracked wider.

Tiny, needling teeth pushed up from its gums, replacing the human ones like shark teeth growing in wrong.

It wasn’t perfect at copying.

It never was.

I didn’t hesitate.

I swung a broken plank I found on the floor straight into its face.

The thing let out a gurgling hiss, its skin splitting open like wet paper.

Beneath the torn Chris-mask, I caught a glimpse of the real face again—stretched, raw, grinning so hard its jaw cracked audibly.

It scuttled back into the shadows on all fours, leaving smears of blood—or something like it—on the cracked tile.

I turned to the real Chris.

“You okay?” I gasped.

He nodded, grimacing through the blood dripping down his jaw.

“We’re not gonna outrun it. We have to end this.”

“But how?”

He glanced down the ruined hallway, then pointed toward a sign hanging lopsided off a bent frame.

SECURITY OFFICE.

If there was anything left in this tomb to help us, it would be there.

We sprinted.

Every step felt heavier, like the mall itself was pulling us down.

The floors cracked underfoot.

The walls pulsed slightly in the corners of my vision, like something was breathing behind them.

We made it to the door.

Chris kicked it open, and we tumbled inside.

Old CCTV monitors lined the walls, half smashed, buzzing with static.

But one still worked, barely holding on like a dying flame.

And what it showed made my stomach drop.

It was us.

Standing in the food court.

Laughing.

Grinning.

Looking happy.

Except we weren’t alone.

Behind our smiling copies, dozens—hundreds—of other figures crept closer.

All wrong.

All twisted in that same broken way.

The screen flickered.

The figures on it turned.

Looked straight at the camera.

And smiled.

Chris slammed the door shut and jammed a broken chair under the handle.

The air inside the security office was thick—like it hadn’t been breathed in years. Dust floated in the beams of the dying flashlight. The CCTV monitor buzzed faintly, still showing that twisted mockery of us laughing while the things gathered behind.

I could hear them now.

Soft skittering outside.

Tap-tap-tap of nails against tile.

Low, wet breathing just beyond the door.

Chris grabbed an old fire extinguisher from the wall and hefted it like a weapon. I found a broken length of pipe near one of the desks. We didn’t say anything—we didn’t need to.

There was no way out.

Whatever that thing was—whatever they were—they didn’t want us gone.

They wanted us replaced.

Chris knelt down beside the door, jaw tight, eyes darting around for anything else we could use.

There wasn’t much.

A few filing cabinets. A rusted vent too small for either of us to squeeze through.

Dead radios.

Dead hope.

The first hit came a few minutes later.

A soft bump against the door.

Followed by another.

And another.

Then the wood cracked.

Tiny fissures racing across its surface like spiderwebs.

They weren’t rushing.

They were playing.

I pressed my back against the far wall, pipe clutched so hard my hands ached.

Chris’s breathing was shallow, fast.

The monitor flickered again.

Now the copies weren’t just laughing.

They were waving at us.

Hundreds of them.

Smiling.

Waving.

Inviting.

The door splintered.

A hand—long, white, too many joints—pushed through the gap.

The fingers groped blindly, questing.

Chris swung the fire extinguisher, smashing the hand back.

The thing let out a high, keening noise—angry, hungry—and pulled away.

For now.

We dragged the filing cabinets in front of the door.

Piled everything we could against it.

But I know it’s not enough.

They’re just waiting.

They want us scared.

Weak.

Ready to be copied perfectly.

I don’t know how much longer we can hold out.

Minutes, maybe.

If anyone out there knows anything—anything at all about what these things are—how to fight them, how to stop them—please.

Please tell me.

I don’t want to die here.

I don’t want to become…one of them.

I can still hear them laughing.

And it’s getting harder to tell which laughter is theirs.

And which is ours.
