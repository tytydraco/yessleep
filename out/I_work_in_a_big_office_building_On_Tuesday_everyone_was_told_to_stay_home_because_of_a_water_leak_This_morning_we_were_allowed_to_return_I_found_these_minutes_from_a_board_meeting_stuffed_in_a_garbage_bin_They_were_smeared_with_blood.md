Meeting called to order at 1pm by chair Lloyd Barton.

Galligan motions to amend and approve last month’s meeting minutes. Vote totals: 8 ayes, zero nays, zero abstentions. Motion carries.

Chair Barton gives summary of quarterly site management report. Expanded office space dipping below 80% usage due to work from home policies. Brief discussion follows. Board members suggest possible methods of keeping Brightspark Ventures employees in office. Ishiguro motions for exploratory committee to research efficacy of several options. Vote totals: 7 ayes, 1 nay, zero abstentions. Motion carries. 

Point of order, Crumb explains her dissent. Cost of exploratory committee could outweigh benefits. Will need to be justified to shareholders.

Before moving on to finance committee report, van der Graaf offers congratulations to Louis Han, whose wife is expecting twins. Han accepts congratulations. Van der Graaf motions to send gift basket, Barton seconds motion. Brief discussion about where gift basket should be from, with Han consulting. Vote totals: 7 ayes and zero nays. Louis Han abstains due to personal nature of the motion.

Sumpter provides finance committee report. ROI on various tech investments shows downturn year-over-year. Sumpter suggests revitalizing tech portfolio with emergent ideas that have not yet been subject to regulation. Motion to create exploratory committee passes unanimously.

Crumb provides highly positive trade show summary. Van der Graaf motions to offer citation to trade show organizer. Chair Barton seconds. Motion carries unanimously.

Quarterly budget passes unanimously following lengthy discussion around finding further efficiency and capturing additional synergies.

As meeting reaches conclusion, Chair Barton approaches door but doesn’t open it. He makes point of order to other board members. He doesn’t feel like leaving yet. Issues raised during meeting seem too important, the opportunities too exciting, for them to simply walk away. Barton motions to extend meeting. Brief discussion in which other members strenuously agree with motion. Several mention that they wish they’d thought of it first. Motion passes unanimously.

Members settle back in for extended session. Ishiguro kicks off conversation around tech investment. After half-hour discussion, Sumpter collects recommendations for the coming quarter, including enhanced investment in AI tools, deeper analytics, and research into biometrically-enhanced employee diet program. Motion to submit recommendations passes unanimously.

Crumb begins discussion around work from home. Issue is controversial, members split between how to get most from office space investment. Suggestions include more enticing workspaces, familial atmosphere, perhaps artificially-induced by consensually-installed neural implant. Crumb reminds meeting that neural implants are in early-development and not yet available to Brightspark.

Sumpter motions to form exploratory committee into accelerating neural implant development. Motion passes unanimously. Sumpter, Crumb, and Han form committee and move to corner of room to begin development.

Ishiguro motions for members to revisit leaving meeting as original meeting was set to end at 3pm and it is now nearly 10pm, which means meeting has been going for 9 hours. Brief discussion follows where Ishiguro is censured for attempting to walk away when members are this close to solving major issues facing Brightspark. Ishiguro assures other members he merely wished to revisit the leaving issue. Van der Graaf points out that member phones and contact with family are distracting from integral business concerns. Chair Barton motions for phones to be locked away for remainder of meeting. Members vote unanimously to amend motion. Amended motion passes unanimously. Phones will now be destroyed.

Meeting continues. Discussion becomes more bluesky. Brainstorming around philosophy of Brightspark Ventures. Questions arise regarding investment as a concept. Members agree it can be thought of as an organism, metaphorically. What does the organism require? Van der Graaf censured for making crude joke, reminded that Brightspark Ventures is an equal-opportunity employer.

At 4am, after prolonged discussion, members agree the investment organism wants efficiency, robust growth, and a commitment to shareholders. Motion to record this discovery passes unanimously. Secretary Emshwiller drafts it by hand on wall of boardroom. Discussion continues.

At 10am, secretary Emshwiller motions for exploratory committee into sleep. Motion is rejected unanimously. Ishiguro vehemently defends continuation of meeting as members are close to enhancing major Brightspark objectives. Chief Barton censures Sumpter for excessive pounding on table during his defense, leading to substantial damage to both wood and hand. Discussion continues, now regarding potential usage of office space during non-work hours and weekends. Suggestions include: filming locations, garbage dump, slaughterhouse, graveyard.

At 1pm, motion for first bathroom break passes by slim margin. Implementation of motion stalls when members who approach door realize that they would rather not leave. They prefer to stay inside the boardroom. Emshwiller motions for formation of exploratory committee to look into why members seem unwilling to leave. Motion rejected unanimously. Chair Barton proposes members are choosing not to leave due to instinctual knowledge that they are part of the investment organism. The desire of the organism is their desire as well. Motion to continue use of wastebaskets in place of bathroom passes unanimously with one abstention.

Sumpter, Han, and Crumb return from corner of room with results of neural implant development. By pooling resources derived from destroyed cellphones and board room coffeemaker, they now have a working prototype. Chair Barton moves to award Sumpter several citations, trophies, and medals of honour. Cracking neural implant in just 15 hours of work is highly impressive.

As point of pride, Sumpter motions to be first to receive implant. Emshwiller motions to be one to perform procedure due to long-standing interest in blades. Both motions carry.

Procedure is mixed success. Sumpter is moved to corner of room as his now-constant drooling is deemed distracting. Sumpter also censured for lack of contribution and complete cessation of voting.

Chair Barton motions that work on neural implant be continued until solution found. Motion passes. Development in corner of room continues.

At 2pm, Galligan motions that work be paused to procure food. Motion carries. Board members still find it unappealing to leave board room and phones are unusable. Emshwiller motions to consider gastronomical amputation of Sumpter. Board members are split, but motion eventually carries after Chair Barton argues stopping for food at this crucial stage would constitute violation of commitment to shareholders.

Sumpter amputation proceeds smoothly and efficiently. Meat is eaten raw to accelerate meeting timeline. Leftovers are placed beneath heat vent to dry and cure.

Minutes neglected for day 3 and 4 of meeting while members pursue rich vein of potential investment strategies, including the development and mixed-success of prototype of neural implant mark two. Van der Graaf cadaver placed in file cabinet for later use.

Day 5 of meeting begins with Ishiguro proposal that Sumpter be removed from board position as he has been fully unable to contribute since blood loss after 5th gastronomical amputation. Sumpter offers no defense. Sumpter does not move. Chair Barton moves to recognize Sumpter’s resignation from membership. Motion passes. Sumpter no longer part of investment organism. Sumpter cadaver disassembled and left under different heat vent for drying and curing. Secretary Emshwiller requests mandible bone so she can craft blade for disassembly of Van der Graaf cadaver.

Han motions to form exploratory committee to address maggot problem. Motion passes unanimously.

Galligan motion to investigate possibility of sleep rejected unanimously, zero ayes, 5 nays. Galligan censured by members in strongest possible terms. Galligan cadaver placed in storage.

Minutes for days 6 through 10 written in pen that, on later inspection, had run dry. Emshwiller censured by Emshwiller.

Meeting minutes day 11.

Emshwiller proposes meeting be moved into ducts. Asks that motion be expedited due to recent circumstances, including presence of police cars parked outside. Han non-responsive. Crumb non-responsive. Chair Barton non-responsive except for trickle of urine from empty pantleg.  Emshwiller seconds her own motion. Motion passes, 1 aye, zero nays, zero abstentions. Emshwiller gathers remaining dried Barton thigh meat from beneath hot air vent, opens air duct, and climbs inside.

Meeting hears sound of police tactical boots approaching Brightspark board room. Emshwiller quietly proposes the meeting takes a left at the next duct fork. Emshwiller seconds the motion. Vote totals: one aye, zero nays, zero abstentions. Motion carries. Board room door opened. Emshwiller times crawling to blend in with screams of officers so as to avoid detection.

Emshwiller proposes the meeting pauses in front of 39th floor vent, near HR, both to regain some strength and because the meeting has heard noise. One aye, zero nays, zero abstentions. Motion carries.

Through vent slats, meeting observes sneakers and cuffs of gray coveralls. Meeting posits these belong to weekend janitor. Emshwiller reminds the meeting that Emshwiller still has the human mandible that she sharpened to a point to better cut away the fats of former meeting. Emshwiller fingers blade as discussion over what to do with janitor continues.

Meeting abandons discussion upon hearing noise from lower floor. Motion to investigate carries.

Observation through air vents on 38th floor reveal source of noise: a different board meeting is taking place. Meeting recalls 38th floor is headquarters of Angelwing Investment Inc. Emswhiller motions for Brightspark meeting to engage in hostile merger with Angelwing meeting to replace deceased board of directors. Motion carries.

Meetings successfully merged with minor casualties. Emshwiller motions to give herself certificate of bravery. Angelwing board members attempt to veto, but reconsider after example is made. Motion carries.

Angelwing board members motion to be released. Motion vetoed by Chairwoman Emshwiller as Angelwing board members are on probation after veto attempt. Chairwoman Emswiller begins report on value of meeting, on enhancing tech portfolio, on employee diet plan, on development of neural implants, on health of investment organism, and on commitment to shareholders.

4 hour Emshwiller speech concludes with sweeping invitation to the new 11 Angelwing board members, requesting their trust in guiding them to new opportunities. Emshwiller introduces motion to formally join Brightspark meeting.

Angelwing board members propose amendment. Emshwiller speech was compelling, fascinating, but they need time to digest brave new concepts.

Angelwing board members motion to extend meeting for further discussion. They are beginning to see the possibilities. It should only take a few more hours.

Vote totals: 11 yeses, zero nos, zero abstentions.

Motion carries.
