Until I saw what he kept in the basement, I might’ve been able to move past that insecurity.

My name is Sonya, I’m 24 years old, and I started dating Mateo a year ago. We met at university, and we had a connection, but Mateo switched direction after graduating – he decided to study medicine instead. Something that, midway through the course, he ended up quitting. So, we didn’t start dating until our paths crossed a few years later. He was a ‘bonny boy’, as my Scottish mother would say. He had the sort of face that could make a person forget their better senses, and that almost happened to me.

I don’t trust pretty exteriors anymore.

Before I tell my tale, I want you to know that I’m smart. I only mentioned that for the sake of context. That was the first time I ever admitted it. Self-confident affirmations are reserved for boys, after all. Ladies must be modest, and they must never outshine their male counterparts.

I’m being frivolous. I don’t *really* believe that women should douse their flaming bras, pick them up, and strap into the 1950s. Yet, so many people in today’s world do believe that. And it's not just the outspoken, oafish sexists who oppress women – it’s the nice boys too. The ones who tell you how amazing you look, though they wish you wouldn’t lie by using make-up. The ones who tell you that you’re strong for a woman.

The ones who like you as long as you don’t outshine them.

Mateo took me out for dinner on our half-anniversary. An act of romance. And now I see it for just that – an act. Much like everything he said and did. It was performative kindness. Kindness that would swiftly crumple like a house of cards.

“Oh, something funny happened at the lab today,” Mateo chuckled.

“Yeah?” I replied, smiling.

“Smithy told me something that… Oh, wait, do you remember him?” Mateo asked.

“Yeah, wow! I didn’t realise he worked with you,” I said.

“He just started,” Mateo replied. “Anyway, we were reminiscing on our uni days. I told him that I’m dating you. He was impressed that I ‘bagged you’!”

“‘*Bagged*’ me?” I said, rolling my eyes at the wording. “Lovely. Am I a bunch of apples on sale?”

Mateo smiled. “Yeah… Well, you remember how goofy Smithy could be… Anyway, he was talking about you being a ‘Physics prodigy’. Prodigy. That was the word he used.”

My boyfriend continued laughing, and I raised an eyebrow. “What’s funny about that?”

Mateo smirked, seemingly befuddled by my frown. “Well, I… No, it’s just… Obviously, you’re skilled in the subject of Physics, but we’re all skilled.”

I smiled, calming down. “Oh, right... Yeah, silly Smithy! We all received the same degree. I don’t know why he was teasing you.”

“Exactly! Plus, Smithy and I were the ones who actually…” Mateo trailed off. “Well, anyway, shall we ask for the bill, so we–”

“– You were the ones who…?” I interrupted, pressing my boyfriend to continue.

The man shuffled irritably in his seat. “Nothing. I’m going to ask for the bill.”

“No, finish your sentence,” I urged.

Mateo sighed. “It’s nothing, Sonya. Stop making a scene.”

“I'm not making a scene,” I insisted. “I just don’t know why you’re being so weird this evening.”

“I just don’t know why he had to belittle me. I’m a lab technician, and you teach high-school science,” He said, shrugging.

My eyes widened. “Wow... *Wow*.”

“Yeah, I knew you’d react badly. That’s why I didn’t want to say it,” Mateo said.

“That’s why you *shouldn’t* have said it,” I replied. “But it’s disgusting that you were even *thinking* it.”

“I’m sorry for thinking the truth,” He shrugged, snapping his fingers at a passing waiter. “May we have the bill, sir?”

The waiter nodded, sensing the tension in the air and hurriedly scurrying away. He could see the breadth of emotions on my face. The hurt. The anger. The confusion, above all else. After six months of dating, Mateo flipped a switch – he became an entirely different person. He’d never spoken to me like that before. He’d never shown his true colours.

And, at that point in the evening, he still hadn’t shown them.

“The *truth*?” I gasped. “Are you serious?”

He shrugged for the third time, and each dismissive reaction only deepened my rage. But, for the sake of not being branded the ‘hot-headed bitch’, I caged my tongue.

The waiter unwillingly returned with a frightened look on his face, and he silently passed the card machine to Mateo. My boyfriend and I held our argument whilst he footed the bill. I offered to pay, but I was met with silence – silence that, as soon as the payment was made, scared the waiter away.

“You just weren’t cut out for the laboratory. And that’s fine, Sonya. Like you said, we all have the same degree. It doesn’t matter who’s done more with it,” Mateo said.

“Done more with it?” I laughed. “I could’ve worked in a lab. I just didn’t *want* to work in a lab.”

“Okay,” Mateo replied, attempting to take the higher ground by remaining calm. “Don’t be hysterical.”

My fists clenched, as did my teeth. “Well, stop saying hysterical things, Mateo.”

“This wasn’t about you, Sonya. Smithy was winding me up. He implied that you were too good for me,” Mateo said. “And he kept raving about how much of a prodigy you were. I received a first-class degree, you know!”

“So did I,” I replied, seething. “Not only that – I was awarded Top-Performing Graduating Student. That’s why Smithy was making the joke. If you’d actually bothered to turn up to the graduation ceremony, you would’ve known that.”

Mateo’s face whitened. “You… What? That’s not a real award.”

I scowled. “I could show you the certificate. I could even show you the scores from my tests, though that seems a little excessive.”

The man was stunned, but that wounded reaction morphed into fury.

“So what? Do you think grades mean anything? I don’t care about a score that you received three years ago, Sonya. It’s just a number,” He growled, eyes swelling with tears that seemed sorrowful and ferocious in equal measure.

“A second ago, you really seemed to care about grades,” I said.

Mateo attempted to control his breathing, and his demeanour shifted. It shifted unnervingly quickly, in fact.

“I’m really sorry. That was completely out of line,” He said.

“It was horrible,” I spat. “I want to go home.”

“I’m so sorry,” He persisted. “It was about me. My ego was bruised by Smithy, and I took it out on you. Please forgive me.”

I sighed. “I just want to go to bed. We’ll talk about it in the–”

“Sonya!” A familiar voice bellowed.

I twisted around to face Keith Dawson, my Chemistry teacher from sixth form. His scraggly hair was greyer than I remembered, and he was standing beside a tall woman.

“Keith!” I replied, grateful to see anything other than my boyfriend's vile face.

“This is my wife, Martina,” He said.

“Hello! It’s lovely to meet you,” She said.

“It’s lovely to meet you too! And this is my... boyfriend, Mateo,” I said, feigning pleasantry.

“Hello, Mateo,” Keith smiled, shaking my boyfriend’s soft, timid hand. “Did you know you were dating the highest-performing student in her class?”

Mateo’s eyes widened. “You were the smartest at college and university, Sonya?”

“We were actually just talking about that,” I icily said. “What a strange coincidence.”

Keith laughed. “Really? The world does work in mysterious ways.”

“Would you like to sit with us?” I asked my old teacher, before looking at my boyfriend. “If that would be okay, Mateo?”

My boyfriend stifled a sigh, desperately trying to claw his way out of a deep hole.

“Yes,” He said. “That would be fine.”

“Oh, we wouldn’t want to intrude…” Martina said, shaking her head.

“It’s not an intrusion,” Mateo lied. “We’ve finished eating. We were going to grab some coffees.”

“We didn’t get a coffee after our meal, sweetheart,” Keith said.

“Well, that settles it,” My boyfriend announced, smiling weakly. “Join us.”

“Thank you, Mateo! What a wonderful young man,” Keith said.

I thought about how well my boyfriend had cast the very same spell upon me.

The elderly man and his wife squeezed into our cosy booth. It was around half eight in the evening, and the tables were slowly starting to empty, but time flew by. We drank coffee and conversed. I was still deeply stung by Mateo’s words, but I loved him – I loved who he’d been until that evening. I wanted to believe that something else had caused him to snap.

*He didn’t mean to say those things to me*, I told myself. *Something must be wrong at work... Smithy upset him. Yes, that’s it.*

“I must say, this makes me feel young!” Keith laughed. “My daughter’s the same age as you, Sonya, and she’d probably be cringing at the silly things I’m saying.”

“Don’t worry – I’m cringing on her behalf,” Martina laughed.

“Well, no change there,” The man said, lovingly grinning at his wife.

I’ve been thinking a lot about that exchange – the look they shared. I don’t think Mateo ever looked at me in that way.

I know good men are out there. Men who actually see the person beneath the shell. But that’s all I had ever been to Mateo – a shell. And when that soft, simple exterior cracked to reveal the substance within, he didn’t like what he saw.

“So, Sonya, what are you doing these days?” Keith asked.

“I’m actually working as a high-school Physics teacher,” I said, smiling.

“*PHYSICS*?” Keith gasped. “But I… I… No, it’s okay… You still chose to teach Science, Sonya. You chose the wrong type of science, but I won’t fault you for that…”

“Well, I still teach Chemistry,” I said. “You know we have to teach all of the sciences.”

“I know. I’m only teasing,” Keith laughed. “And what about you, Mateo? What do you do?”

“I work as a lab technician,” He bleakly replied.

“You don’t sound too happy about that,” Martina said, smiling.

My boyfriend shrugged. “I just think I could’ve done… more with my life. I studied Medicine for a little while, but… Well, this suits me.”

“You’re so young, Mateo! You and Sonya can do whatever you want with your lives,” Martina said.

Mateo’s face lit up. “Sorry, it’s just been a long week. But it’s Saturday night – I think we deserve to enjoy ourselves. Don’t you agree, Sonya?”

I nodded uncertainly.

“Say, how would you two fancy accompanying us for a nightcap?” Mateo asked Keith and Sonya. “I live across the road – it’s a 30-second walk.”

Keith looked at Martina, and she shrugged. He then cast his gaze to me.

“Would that be okay, Sonya?” The kind man asked. “I already sense that you were just being polite by entertaining your old teacher and his wife this evening.”

I smiled. “Keith, I’d be offended if you were to say *no*!”

I longed to sleep off that awful night, but I didn’t want Keith or Martina to feel bad. And, truthfully, I believed the earlier discomfort of the evening had dissipated.

As we relaxed in Mateo’s flat, the memory of the argument started to flee my mind – alcohol might’ve helped, of course. The four of us drank whiskey in the living room. We laughed, and we cried. We discussed everything from the wonders of science to our favourite Love Island contestants.

“Right, it’s, erm… It’s eleven o’clock…” Keith drunkenly slurred. “And we’re not as young as you crazy kids… We'd better head home… Where is… Where’s Martina?”

“She went to the toilet,” I said. “She’ll be back.”

“Yeah, I… That was about an hour ago,” Keith pointed out, clearly struggling to think clearly. “I’ll go and check on her.”

Though I was also quite tipsy, I laughed as the inebriated man hobbled out of the room. Finding the moment too funny to forget, I immediately texted Tess – my oldest friend. I let her know that our high-school teacher was stumbling around Mateo’s house drunkenly. She didn’t believe me, so I followed Keith into the hallway and snapped a piece of photographic evidence.

“FLESH IN THE GRAPE TOWER!” A distant voice screamed.

The unexpected, disjointed exclamation sent a shock-wave of fear through my body. My phone jolted out of my hand and clattered to the floor. However, in my merry stupor, I didn’t think to pick it up. I simply waddled forwards, chasing the source of the sound.

“In the grape… In the grape tower…” A muffled voice loudly giggled.

There was something deeply disturbing about it. The inflections of the words felt wrong, as did the varying volume. It sounded so unnatural and confused.

I realised that the noise was coming from the basement, and I was baffled to find light spilling through the doorway – the door was always locked. Mateo claimed it had been locked since he started renting the place, and he also claimed that he hadn’t bothered to ask the landlord for a key.

“H… Hello?” I tipsily called. “Are you o–”

The basement light clicked off.

Possessed by an instinctive urge to run, I found myself staring into the colourless crater of Mateo’s basement. From the darkness below, footsteps pattered across the floor. They ricocheted off the walls, coating my back with goosebumps. I felt fear in my heart, but my head was telling me that I had to go downstairs.

Resisting every primitive urge, I descended into the basement.

With every squeak of my unsteady feet against the wooden steps, my fear heightened. I’m not a superstitious person. I’m not even particularly afraid of the dark. Nevertheless, months later, that basement still plagues my dreams.

“Hello?” I called a second time.

Nothing.

I finally reached the bottom of the stairs, and I realised that I didn’t have my phone. I was standing in the darkness, feeling a nearby wall for a light switch.

“Give and… Give… Think,” That disjointed voice wailed.

That was when I saw her. The woman in the corner.

A haunting, shadowy spectre swayed listlessly at the end of the basement. Her form was dimly outlined by the street light pouring through Mateo’s basement window. She was facing the wall and murmuring something.

“Are you okay, Martina?” I asked.

The woman stopped swaying so suddenly that my heart halted. She began to twitch violently, horrifying me – I felt as if I were being enveloped by the black walls of that underground dungeon. But I’d come that far. I had to help her.

Guided by the street light, I stumbled towards the woman. Tripping over various boxes and bags, I slowly neared her, and I started to distinguish bodily features. For starters, it wasn’t Marina. The woman was far too short.

When I was close enough, I delicately placed a hand on the stranger’s shoulder. The twitching slowed, as did her breathing. And then, at a glacial pace, her neck turned. Like a clockwork doll, her joints clicked and ached, as if she were being wound up for the first time in an age.

“Are you okay, miss?” I quietly asked.

The light caught her face, and I hurled.

The woman’s forehead was caving *inwards*, as if it were a deflated football. Skin sealed the horrific slope, but the fresh flesh appeared to have been haphazardly stitched into place. Her eyes were glazed, as if she were no longer able to register the world around her. And drool dripped from her ever-parted, ever-trembling lips.

“I could… Yes… It has to be a thing…” She jabbered nonsensically.

Without warning, her hand gripped my upper arm in a vice-like hold.

“Never mind… Towers… Okay, Mum,” She said, unleashing a hoarse cry.

“... I’m going to get help,” I shivered, prying her strong fingers from my arm.

Before the damaged woman could injure me again, whether intentionally or not, I twisted to flee the basement. And a warm wave of panic immediately drenched my face.

There was a black silhouette at the foot of the stairs.

“Sleep well, Sonya,” Mateo whispered.

The black shape disappeared into the darkness. Blind to his whereabouts, I fearfully tried to raise my hands in defence. But darkness followed a blunt, excruciating blow to the head.

When I woke, my eyesight was blurry. My head felt as if it were split down the centre. As I wrestled my eyelids farther apart, however, my mind started to wake. I realised I was eyeing a blindingly-white surgical light above me, and when I looked away, my vision began to adjust.

I was lying on an operating table in the middle of a grey, soundproofed, box room – possibly only eight by eight feet. There were red stains on the walls. Some were fresher than others.

As the ringing in my pulsating ears started to lessen, I became aware of moans. So, I lifted my head, which was a dreadful idea for two reasons.

It was immensely painful, and it revealed a nightmarish sight.

Sitting in a neat row against the wall, there were three women. Each of them had foreheads caved inwards, though some deformities were less prominent than others. Their eyes were lazily surveying the room, and their mouths gaped. But what broke me was the girl rocking on her legs.

*I recognised her.*

“Chloe…?” I breathlessly whimpered.

The girl’s eyes didn’t meet mine. She was staring at the wall with the same vacant expression as the other women.

“Make the… Okay… Make it better,” She said.

Her voice was full of jarring inflections and volume shifts. And I started to sob, remembering the girl I’d known at university. A girl who had been so bright – so full of life.

“What happened to you?” I cried.

Following a series of sudden thunderous footsteps, the door opened. And, peering through it, I saw a familiar narrow window at the end of a lightless room – Mateo's basement lay beyond the grey, padded, blood-stained box. The man had hidden a prison of horror beneath his flat.

How many nights did I spend above those poor, mutilated women?

“Ah, you’re awake,” He said.

The malicious man was carrying a squirming body over his shoulder, and he placed her beside the other three women. It was the lady I’d first seen in the basement.

“Mateo…” I croaked, wriggling in my restraints. “Please...”

“I was just preparing some dinner for you, ladies,” Mateo said, ignoring me.

The man shuffled around the cramped room and handed each of the women a separate place. Chloe looked down at it, but the other two continued to stare aimlessly around the room – seemingly oblivious to the meals.

“It’s a roast dinner. Okay? Food... Do you understand? You’ve seen food before, silly girls,” He chuckled, whilst helping each of them to eat. “Your favourite meal, Michelle! And Rosie, you love your vegetables. Come on… What’s wrong? Is it the meat? Is it a little tougher than usual?”

“Mateo…” I sobbed.

“Well, I’ve got a secret,” The man whispered, continuing to dismiss me. “It’s a different cut of meat. A slightly *older* meat.”

Mateo paused, and he finally locked his eyes onto mine. They were wide and unhinged, much like the unsavoury smile beneath. And, as I carefully inspected the food, I started to piece together the terrible turn of events. The bloody plates. The *toughness* of the meat.

“Where’s Martina...? Where’s Keith?” I whispered, lip quivering.

The man smiled coldly. “There wasn’t room for them, Sonya. But there’s room for *you*.”

Mateo began to unload the contents of a tool bag, revealing an assortment of surgical instruments, and I started to scream tearfully.

“Why are you crying?” He asked. “I just implied that I *wouldn’t* ever let them eat you, Sonya. There. I stated it plainly for you. Honestly, I thought you were *smart*.”

“Okay, Mateo… Okay… I’ll be dumb… Is that what you want?” I wailed.

“I’m just putting things right, Sonya. You remember what Chloe was like. I made her better. I *love* her, Sonya,” Mateo said. "And I'll love you too. I *promise*."

The man crouched down, and he grabbed Chloe’s limp, lobotomised head in his hands. He placed a kiss on her caved forehead – she barely seemed aware of his presence.

“Potatoes…” She whispered, before groaning painfully.

Mateo laughed sinisterly. “Yes, clever girl. Well done. They *are* potatoes. You're starting to understand.”

“I’m sorry for upsetting you,” I sobbed. “Just let me go, Mateo. You don’t have to do this.”

“It's only a small procedure, Sonya. You won’t feel a thing… Well, you won’t *remember* feeling a thing. You won't do much, actually. Life will be so much easier for you. We’ll sit a Physics test afterwards. I'm so excited to see who scores higher,” He whispered.

“No…” I moaned, watching Mateo remove the drill from the bag.

“Don’t worry. I’ve vastly improved the procedure since I worked on Laurel. You met her earlier. She was my first trial. But look at Chloe – you can hardly tell she’s any different,” Mateo said.

I cried in disbelief. “She’s not Chloe anymore… She’s not even–”

“– *intelligent*,” Mateo finished, smiling. “I’ve freed her of that burden. *And I’ll free you too*.”

As the drill started to whir, I screamed in terror – my mind braced for the horror of surviving as an unthinking shell. The inhuman man inched closer, and a wailing noise sounded in the distance. Frowning at the sudden distraction, Mateo begrudgingly turned the drill off. We could hear clearly.

It was a police siren.

“No… What have you *done*?” He snarled, baring menacing teeth at me.

The man looked stuck. Unable to formulate a plan. As the siren neared at a rapid pace, however, Mateo finally decided to flee. The police officers missed him by a minute, and one of the responders vomited at what they found in the basement.

Sending Tess the photo had saved my life.

In my intoxicated state, I hadn’t properly inspected the picture of Keith's drunken walk. But Tess noticed Martina’s bloody body atop the kitchen table. The photo also revealed Mateo watching me from the shadowed corner of the kitchen.

Whilst I searched the basement, my murderous boyfriend apprehended Keith in the bathroom. Then, he attacked me. He clearly hadn’t realised I sent the picture to someone – he must’ve believed he could clean up everything. But Tess immediately rang the police, and Mateo abandoned the scene without a trace.

The four lobotomised women are currently living under supervised care. I visit Chloe frequently, but it’s incredibly painful to do so. Such a small fragment of her remains – a damaged, incomprehensible fragment. None of her sentences make sense. I don’t even know whether she exists painfully or happily.

What terrifies me, above all other things, is the knowledge that Mateo is still out there.
