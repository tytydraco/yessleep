I live in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. There is an abandoned office building around eight kilometres from where I live. The office building was built in 1989, and quickly abandoned with the company leaving the place in a hurry. A few weeks back, me and a group of friends decided to break in to the office building. The office building was in a bad state, with vegetation growing everywhere, and file cabinets filled with decomposed papers scattered everywhere. We had a fun time exploring all the different areas of the office building, including the CEO's office. However when we reached the archives of the building, I discovered that it was completely empty except for a desk sitting in the far corner of the room. On the desk was a cardboard box full of strange tapes. Being curious, I decided to take them back to my home.

When I got home, I discovered that the tapes have been heavily damaged by weather and age. I decided to send the tapes one by one to a "video restorer guy" in Sydney. I am sending them one by one because it is cheaper. So it has been three weeks since I sent the first tape, and I instantly watched it. The video is strange and interesting:

The video starts off with a message saying that all incoming phone calls to the NIFAR Laboratory are automated to protect the identities of the people. This was strange, as what company automates their incoming calls and why would they need to protect their employees using that method?

I continued on watching. The screen changed to another message saying that the content that we were going to listen to was a phone call between two employees of NIFAR by the names of "Mr Hartnell" and "Dr Smith" on January 18 1989. The screen changed to a worm's eye view of the NIFAR office building, which was the one that I just visited a few weeks back. 

Then, the conversation played. An automated voice who I believe is supposed to be Mr Hartnell was having a conversation to "Dr Smith". However, Dr Smith couldn't be heard on the phone. The automated voice was so weird. It was a strange voice, sounding extremely creepy, as the voice was very off. 

From the one-way conversation, I could piece together that Dr Hartnell was reporting from Boolaroo, which is a town near Newcastle. Their conversation started off strange in the beginning. Mr Hartnell was talking about a "underground cavity" being found in a certain excavation site at the town. I couldn't grasp most of the conversation, as the automated voice and damage on the tape caused most portions to be incomprehensible. However, I managed to understand a couple of more lines. They were both extremely strange as well. Mr Hartnell seemed to be talking about a "fountain" and how it was pagan talk. the last couple of words said in the conversation was Hartnell saying that they would commence excavation and how exploration of the cavity was possible in the next week. 

After watching the tapes, I got really interested. I started researching online about NIFAR. The company was formed in 1981 as a pharmaceutical company. By 1985, they were delving into the realm of age-prevention medicine. The founder of the company, a certain Pontius Greene came up with this theory that a certain spring located somewhere in the world, which it's waters had the power to de-age people. By 1988, they sent out a group of their researchers to excavate a site in India that was possibly where the spring was located. They didn't find what they were looking for, but it seemed like at the site, they discovered some sort of clues that led them to the true location of the spring. In late 1988, they got a contract with the Australian government to excavate in a plot of land in the outskirts of Boolaroo with the pretence of coal mining. In January 1989, it seems like they found something. Somehow everything went downhill after the finding. Many employees went missing, the amount of missing people in the nearby area started to rapidly increase. Soon enough, the company found itself under pressure by the Australian Government for giving a false reason to excavate. For some reason, the company swiftly abandoned the excavation site on December 29 1989. The day before was the Newcastle Earthquake, which was an extremely devastating earthquake that destroyed a lot of towns. The epicentre was Boolaroo. People might believe that the abandonment of the excavation site was due to the earthquake, but due to the close similarities, I believe something more sinister and nefarious took place.

I sent out the second tape for repairs two days ago. I am really waiting for what the next tape will be like. Tape 1 : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPC0KZJJLbE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPC0KZJJLbE)
