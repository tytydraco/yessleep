This story takes place over the span of around 35 years beginning with a dream for I was in the seventh grade at the time. Having a sleepover at a friend’s house remembering telling him at the time about a dream, a dream that I had that night.

Just as we were heading to the local comic shop I remembered telling him about it for in the dream I could see blonde haired girl standing in a picture holding a skateboard. A picture that would come to haunt me years later in a way I would have never felt possible.

As the years went by I would all but forget about having the dream until one night when I was living on my own. When another dream I would have! But this dream would be much more darker! With a much more realistic feel to it! For in the dream I could see a woman standing in flames holding up what seemed to be a paper with something written on it not being able to see what was written on it. Just seeing her face as she Stood there in agony screaming in pain! Saying to me

Don’t Do It 

Pointing to the paper she was holding up in her hand. Just as a strange frightening eerie feeling suddenly came over me! 

A feeling of dread a feeling of I did not choose this person! Of what it meant at the time I had no idea of what was to come or The days that was to come 

When the woman in the flames then suddenly vanished! 

That was when faces of different girls began to appear one by one showing only certain aspects of their face leaving other aspects darkened. As if they were faces from a picture not knowing at the time who they were I would really fully never know

For ever since I could remember I had always had a fear over a movie, with the movie being ‘ Carrie’ that had came out in 1976. Never really knowing why until I went to see the one that came out in 2013 with 
Chloe Grace Moretz
For on that day I would understand why I had always had a fear over this movie. 

That is when it all started! A week or two had gone by with the feeling never leaving me a feeling of something inside of me was urging me urging me to write something!

And write something I did! A binding contract! The first one, but at the time I did not know that many more would follow

That night I could remember being forced awake seeing a hand reaching for my face followed with the feeling of something being ripped through my face! Falling to the floor as I grasping for air! 

As the morning would come I found myself at work feeling emotionally drained from life from a lack of sleep. As a feeling of eeriness was all around me that day a feeling that is really unexplainable and that was when I first saw them! 

With the first one seeming as if he just suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The very first noticeable thing about him was his eyes with what seemed to be a white light coming from his eyes for a split second walking a short distance away from me

And that is when I noticed the second one! Waking towards me! this one a female with a walk that did not seem human even though both of them very much looked human from  a distance. With them seeming to be wearing clothing that someone would wear from the 1940’s . 

And that is when I looked into her eyes! Eyes that one could tell where not that of a human up close as the white around her blackened pupils was more like a solid pure pearl white! Much more than a human eye color could be making it that every photo that I would see after that 

Be that I would only see the person eyes as if I was looking at her eyes! Grinning as she walked by me her looked said it all 

“ You belong to us now”! Just as the male then walked over to me grabbing my hand just as he slid his finger up the palm of my hand with both of them then leaving just as quickly as they came. 

And for the next eleven years the dreams would come and go! Dreams showing me not only girls that I would write a binding contract on. 

But dreams also showing me things that the girl would be doing in a television show or movie’ while at the same time opening a door revealing the next girl.

For example in one dream it showed a famous girl driving a certain car make with the following day showing the exact scene in the show. With the television show being about a popular Witch! But in the dream showing her getting out of the car walking over to a door opening it up revealing the next girl. 

With another dream showing a possible up coming movie possibly starring Elizabeth Olsen! With Elizabeth Olsen playing a Park Ranger being chased through a mountain pass by three individuals. With her co star being another M.C.U actor! Benedict Wong! 

But just as in the second dream as it would show the faces one by one! For one by one! I would encounter each of the girls not all of them but some of them Just showing me that they could until the final one. 

And now back to the second dream, For the papers that the woman in the flames was holding up what I would later on in life thought that could have been binding contracts! But now I believe them to be short stories! A short story! Short stories that was sent in to a YouTuber for a contest around three or four years ago. 

For one day while at work, an actress, Natalie Portman came in shopping with her family with her asking if we had a product in stock in which we did not at the time. But as she and her family walked away I overheard her say that she liked one of my short stories a short story that was sent to this YouTuber. 

A short story titled ‘A Place In Heaven’ Stories by the way that are not published! With the actress being one of others to come, others that I had written a binding contract on. 

Another instance on the short stories happened when two YouTubers being John Campea
and Robert Meyer Burnett was talking about upcoming releases from CinemaCon. 

But just as their stream had seemed to end or so they thought had ended. They then started talking between themselves with one of them seemingly not really being to sure of this Talking about a project that the executives of a certain studio that was interested in it at the time. 

But Robert Meyer Burnett knew exactly what he was sure of he was doing! 

With the studio being Paramount! That was when they had mentioned the name of another one of my short stories titled ‘Abby’ No one else noticed it but me! 
From a short story contest that seemed to never happened! A short story contest that was made to vanish! For whether nothing ever comes of these short stories remains unknown 
With me knowing that 
They done it just to show me that they could!

And now back to the second dream one last time! Just as the faces had come and gone! It showed one last girl with a date above her! A date that to this day I cannot remember all of it exactly as it was written. Just as I then heard a loud crashing noise around me not being able to move feeling arms wrapping around me feeling a tongue sliding up and down the side of my face hearing a voice saying 

“ I will rip the flesh from his body”! 

Just as a second voice then said “ He isn’t dead yet we can’t take him” but then just as the voices began to fade I heard one last thing with on of them saying. “ He will become a girl just before he dies.“ 

35 years later’ Just a little over a year ago while I was working around closing standing there at the service desk when just happened to look up only to see the girl that was in the photo from the first the first dream. And standing there in front of me was none other than Dakota Fanning herself! One by one! Till the final one! With me Never Knowing or Deceived until the my end! 
Until then I will never know 

On a different note! Still belonging very much so with the story itself little over eight years ago while at work.

My pastor at the time had came in shopping stoping next to me to say hi. But just as he did a Laugh! With not only me hearing it but I could see the look in his eyes! Seeing him look suddenly in the direction of the laugh.

It wasn’t even but a couple of months later that I had heard that he just left! Not only the church! But his family as well.

Never to hear what really happened to him but from that day on but I knew in my heart what had happened that day.

The Demon that laughed was basically letting me know that I was going to go through this on my own 

But for now another dream I had and in the dream different things it showed me. Not of any celebrities but of things that I would see.

And the very next day I would see! For in the dream it showed me two different things that I would see on
YouTube that day.

One of them being a woman in a coat walking and the next was a dollar amount. With both happening in the same video the same woman in the coat and the exact dollar amount that I heard.

But just before the dream had ended I was handed a remote! Meaning that the control of what was to come was now in my control the fate of my soul was now in my hands. 

All of the warnings the dreams was now over I saw the video right before the last one was signed! 

The last one has been written the last one that I saw in that second dream.

For from the very first sunrise of me knowing till the final sunset that I will ever see.

That on that day I will know and understand what I chose and what led me to why I chose what I chose 

Knowing and understanding that this was what I asked for.
