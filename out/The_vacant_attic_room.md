My old house was a queen Anne Victorian style, three levels, built from the ground up in my early childhood years! We had all the room to wander, goof around and have the best childhood any kid could ask for! We never delved into ACTUALLY investigating the whole house, but when I was 19, that urge to explore the unknown in the house kicked in, and oh boy did it ever give me the chills!

&#x200B;

One day, when I was home alone, I got the sudden urge to just explore! You know that feeling when you know something needs to be found, but you don't know what, well that hit me like a ton of bricks! I didn't know what I would find, but what I did find and experience, will change your perspective on things you never know about, meaning time travel, and dreaming!

It was a hot summer day, and I was home alone! Mom and dad were out on a camping trip for a few weeks and they left me with guarding the house! Ironic, but knowing I had to work during the time they were gone, they left me to it! Dad built this house, board by board, brick by brick and tile by tile with help when I was a toddler in 1989! I knew he did, because I still get to see those pictures! But what he DIDNT tell me, Im surely going to give him hell for it!

During the afternoon, I went into the attic to look for something my mother told me to go after! I made my way up the stairs, and the whole attic, mind you, was full of stuff my mom keeps for special events and other storage! I found myself looking over EVERYTHING, because I love to see where mom keeps stuff knowing I know nothing about where things are!

I was looking over one shelf when I saw a unknown door!

"Thats odd" I said to myself, "never seen that door before!"

I climbed over the shelf and approached it!! It was smaller than a normal door, and it was tucked into the side of the room! I grabbed the handle and got an instant shock of adrenaline! You know that feeling when you expect something to happen, that's the feeling! I opened the door to darkness and nothing happened!

I shrugged it off and went back to what I was looking for! I found the prize and went back downstairs and enjoyed the rest of the day! Mom called and told me that I should expect them tomorrow afternoon and asked if I could prepare dinner for that evening! I gladly obliged

That evening, I went back to the attic to investigate the door a little more and see how long it had been there! Thats when everything changed. I climbed the stairs to the attic and saw a faint light coming out. I slowly opened the attic door and saw the light coming from the unknown door and made my way cautiously to it! I was just about to open it when a blast of hot air it me and I was out.

I came to in a field in bright sunlight, and I looked around to see where I was. Thats when I saw a HUGE castle standing in front of me! Medieval looking and ominous, I knew I had just time travelled back into the age of swords and mystical beings! I heard a sound come from behind me and I swung around to see a man on a horse, all dressed in clothing, circa 1200s!

"Hello there, you are an odd fellow!" He said, in a very old English Accent. "Do you know your way?"

"No', I said, stuttering a bit

"Lets take you to the high king and see what he makes of you!" as he grabbed me forcefully to my feet!

We made our way into the castle and there before me was the biggest and most decorated room I've ever seen! Colors of all kinds and just jeweled with riches no one could imagine!

"My lord, I have brought to you a lonely traveler! He is not known to these parts! I found him in the field near the moat!" He said as people gathered around to study me.

"Ah, someone who is foreign to us needs to be heard!" The king said, standing up "who are you strange fellow?? Where does one live!"

"Im sorry your royal majesty, I'm not from this realm! I am a figure from distant years!" I said, looking directly at him

"Distant years??" He said Shockingly, "tell me, young one, what years are you from?"

"I'm from the time of cars and rifles! Times to where you need no one to fight for anything except for honor and pride!" I said with great pride, "I don't know how you will take this your majesty, but I'm a time traveler! I'm from future years!"

Just then everyone around me took a step back as the king made his way to me, scowling and trying to make sense of me!

"Future? Time Travel? Dear boy, we have never heard of such things! Until we get to the bottom of all this ruckus, we might need to put you in the dungeon! UNLESS, you show us great power from this future realm, we will grant you pardon and I'll make you a part of my high court!" He looked at me angrily, waiting for my reply

"I would be honored your majesty!! Your wish is my command!" I said, holding my head high, wondering what I got myself into.

The next thing I know I was being led into this courtyard where there was three men lined up, blind folded, on their knees with cloaked figures holding on to them!

"You will do this execution deed, this will show if you are from the time you say! Pick your weapon dear friend!!" He said with a smirky smile

I had to do as he said or my head would be next. I looked over the choice of weaponry, and saw what I was good at, archery! So I grabbed the arrow and bow and proceeded to wait for his command for the event!!!

"Ok strange fellow, make your due haste and show us your power!" 

I made my stand directly angled next to one of the men and had them all lined up in my sights! I had to line them up like I was getting three deers at once, not missing the spot I needed to line. I pulled back on the bow and counted to three, releasing the arrow and the crack of it hitting the first gentleman resonated through the whole courtyard then they all fell, the last man having the arrow straight through his brain, blood hemorrhaging out of this mouth and head.

"My heavens, dear friend that was the best shot of an arrow I've seen in ages! What is your name young man!" I noticed he was holding back tears as he looked into my eyes

"I would like to keep my name anonymous your majesty! I'll hold that true and you have my word on keeping this bow and arrow next to me!" I said, dreading my words

The next day was my worst challenge! I woke up in this dream or whatever it was called to several knights needing me to come out side and help!

I get outside and see the whole castle is under attack! I grab my bow and arrow and start shooting! Then it happens, I'm hit! A bow from an unknown angle gets me in the chest and in through the lungs! 

Thats when I wake up SCREAMING to my parents in the room!

"HEY HEY HEY! You ok, you were really breathing heavy and moving alot! Mom called me home because she was worried you were having a medical issue!" My dad said, wondering what was wrong!!

"Did you want me to tell you what was going on!? You'll never believe what I'm going to tell you!" I said laughing but I did have one question for my mom.

"Hey mom, where did you find me?" I asked

"I found you in the attic, passed out on the floor. You didn't wake up when I shook you so I carried you to your room and put you to bed. Thats when you started acting strange and I called dad!" She exclaimed

As I got out of bed to go to the bathroom, I noticed a sharp pain in my side! I got to the bathroom mirror and pulled my shirt up and there on my side was a small incision at the top of my lungs!

Like I said, Time Travel can be real, but sometimes the reactions can be real and you'll never know if the history will back it up
