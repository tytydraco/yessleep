I am not going to say this in a convoluted way, there is a demon that hides in my house. It comes once or twice a day, usually depending on how I feel, if I was just dumped or was just fired, it could come twice, or even more times a day, if the day is like most, and I don't end up drinking myself silly, that demon comes once, and only once.

It is not your usual demon, when it comes, it'll only stand in my room, in the corner, it waits, waits for me to fall asleep. If I do, it loses, and if I don't, it wins. It's a very simple game. When I fall to sleep, it won't kill me, it won't destroy me or my family, it will simply leave through my door, and out the front. It will not come back until tomorrow, where we will repeat this stupid game again, and again, and again.

If I don't, then it wins, and it wins mostly from me turning my screen on, can be any screen, a phone, the computer, anything. Once it's won, it'll saviour its victory, it'll watch me to the morning, it gets in my head, and it conveys, horrible thoughts, of harm, of loss, of...Never mind.  
All that you need to know is that it is a horrible demon.

So, why am I writing this? I am not in immediate danger, nor am I in terrible loss. Yet.

I am writing this, because this demon, is winning, every night, every time, I watch it, it's gotten closer, and now, six years later, it is now next to me, savouring my apathy, and enjoying the panic and hatred I instil in myself every time I turn that screen on.

It is winning, and it is winning quickly.

This is as much of a demon, as it is for a cry of help, the demon is overtaking me, my family has been destroyed from this, the demon constantly steering me to the next screen, hoping to trap me for as long as it needs too, and then. Bang, it happens, and it wins once again.

If it's next to me, why not just attack it? I have, many, many times, but that bastard stays. It never loses, it never leaves, I have tried my absolute damnedest, and every time, it simply gets back up, laughing at this pitiful attempt to take it down. It gets closer, and it laughs, that wretched laugh, and it does so, again, and again, every time I lose this fuckin' game.

One day, it will over take me, one day it will get me, one day, it will attack, it will overrun, and then I can finally breathe my last breath, suffocating on my own blood, tears in my eyes, sorrow in my heart, hateful and wretched thoughts in my head. And when that happens, it'll smile, I know it will, and it will finally achieve its final victory.

I should probably explain when it started popping up. 

It was around six years ago, I was just on this screen, when the demon. Popped up, as an eleven year old, I didn't really care, my ego being the size of Texas certainly didn't help, I thought I was invincible, and so I just ignored it. The demon appeared and when it appeared, it was small, very small, no bigger than the tip of my finger. It watched me, intently, it didn't take its eye's off me for multiple minutes, though they felt like hours, this new exciting thing, idea, was intoxicating. 

I didn't bother to even bat an eye to the, thing in my room, it would disappear at night, I wasn't scared, and it would come at day, when it's obvious if I was in trouble. I would simply scream, I would simply shout.

I was in High school when it started, and it followed me from time to time, but usually stayed in the dark of my room, and the quiet of the corridors of emptiness. I would sometimes encounter it outside the bathroom of High school, and I would sometimes see it outside my classroom, as people cracked yet another joke of bathroom troubles to my tardiness.

The demon grew in size, constantly, by the time I was only thirteen, it was starting to duck behind me at doors. Around this time, it started appearing more, looming over each door I opened, even appearing in the living room, outside the bathroom door, anytime I had a bath particularly, the kitchen as well. Though, it didn't really appear elsewhere, out with friends or family for example, not a peep from it. Not even a voice or sight. 

Yes, I did say voice, it does make noises, it doesn't really talk but it sure as hell makes noises, these noises don't really make sense, not human nor devilish, more just gibberish, this gibberish is different from others you may of heard of. I don't really know how to describe, I won't. Simply.

Now, I am more of an idiot, a bigger idiot, more aware, but still stupid. And this is were the problem arises, you see, this demon doesn't leave each night, I almost always fall for its pull, each and every night, or morning, in the case that is where I feel nothing is worth living for. It stays in that fucking corner, driving me more insane from what it's doing each moment it breathes down my neck, it almost stretches over me, having gotten to the point where it lays on the ceiling, looking, drooling on me.

The solution is to look at that bastard screen, again, and again, and again. And every time, it saviours that bastard look, that thing retreats, but stretches out against my wall, watching me, watching me while I sleep. It is starting to leave less, and this is why I am writing this statement.

It is getting closer, it is getting closer, and it will get closer. It has grown greatly, it has stretched its way of life around my frail neck, and its grip, that bony hand and slender fingers, it is getting me, it is dragging me along, it is starting to win this battle, this demon no longer sits in a blob, harmless, it strides, it climbs, it strikes. No where I can go, no where I can hide, it will find me, it will get me, it always have, and it always will.

It climbs the walls of buildings of where I hide, it hides in the shadows of my home, and now, it's starting to get deeper, deeper and further into my soul, even my dreams, and this is why I have written this, this is why I am begging you, this is the message I hope you'll listen too.

My dreams are infiltrated, and my heart and mind can only think of such dark and horrific thoughts, of violence, or slaughter, of rage and hate. And all I can say to you, is that, this demon is winning, once and for all. And I am scared, I am scared not just for myself, I am scared for you, the person listening or reading this.

This demon isn't a me problem, at least, it isn't just a me problem, and I hope that you will promise me that you do as I say:

If I, follow along with this. If I, ever encounter a small demon, I will stamp it out immediately, I will throw out whatever causes it to appear, whether that's a screen or a drink, or whatever it is. I will not question, I will not look back, I will not stop until that demon leaves. 

Because trust me, I know you have a demon, and it will get you, quicker than you think.
