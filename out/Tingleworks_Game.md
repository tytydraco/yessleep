Here once was a mysterious user on Reddit known as Tingleworks. No one knew where he came from or what he wanted, but his posts always seemed to be about strange and twisted games. He would invite users to play, promising them rewards beyond their wildest dreams. But those who accepted soon found themselves in a nightmare.  One user, let's call him John, received a friend request from Tingleworks. Intrigued by his bizarre posts, John accepted the request and started playing one of his games. But as he progressed, he began to feel a sense of dread creeping up on him. The game was unlike anything he had ever played before, and he soon realized that it was a trap.  Tingleworks was not just a harmless user on Reddit, he was a psychopath who enjoyed torturing his victims through the internet. He would hack into their devices, control their webcams, and watch their every move. And once he had gained control, there was no escape.  John tried to log out of the game, but it was too late. Tingleworks had already taken control of his computer and was now using it to spy on him. John could feel his heart racing as he realized that he was trapped in a game that he could not win.  Days turned into weeks, and John became a shell of his former self. He had lost all hope of ever escaping Tingleworks' twisted game. He had accepted his friend request, and now he was paying the price for it. The lesson here is simple, never accept a friend request from Tingleworks. You never know who might be behind the screen. Also not only in reddit did Tingleworks appear, also a lot of platforms such as discord actually more usual then Reddit. 

As John continued to play Tingleworks' game, he began to notice strange things happening in his home. Objects would move on their own, doors would open and close by themselves, and he could hear whispers coming from the shadows.

He tried to ignore it, thinking it was just his imagination playing tricks on him, but the eerie feeling only grew stronger. He would wake up in the middle of the night, covered in sweat, unable to shake the feeling that he was being watched.

One day, while playing the game, Tingleworks suddenly appeared on his screen. John could see his twisted grin, and his eyes seemed to glow with a sinister light. He knew that he had made a grave mistake by accepting his friend request.

Tingleworks began to speak, his voice deep and distorted. "You have made a grave mistake, John. You should have never accepted my friend request. Now, you are mine to play with, and there is no escape."

John tried to shut off his computer, but it was too late. The game had taken control of his system, and Tingleworks had gained access to his home network. John was trapped in a digital nightmare, and there was no way out.

The days turned into months, and John's sanity began to slip away. He would scream and cry, begging for Tingleworks to release him, but there was no response. He was alone, trapped in a world of darkness and terror.

And then, one day, the whispers stopped. John was left in complete silence, wondering what had happened. But he knew deep down that it was not over. Tingleworks was still out there, lurking in the shadows, waiting for his next victim to fall into his trap.

From that day on, John lived in constant fear, knowing that Tingleworks was always watching, always waiting. He never forgot the lesson he had learned, to never accept a friend request from a stranger on the internet. The price was too high, and the consequences were too terrifying to imagine.
