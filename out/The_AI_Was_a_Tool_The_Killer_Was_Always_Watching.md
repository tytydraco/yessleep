[Part 1 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j0q6u6/i_asked_an_ai_for_a_writing_prompt_it_wanted_me/)

The police were no help.

Two officers came to my apartment—one young, barely out of his twenties, and the other older, exuding the kind of exhaustion that came from seeing too much. They took my statement, checked the door, glanced around the house, and barely looked at the phone before handing it back.

"It’s locked," the younger officer said with a shrug. "Not much we can do unless you can unlock it."

I stared at them in disbelief. "What about the notifications? There’s a post on the dark web putting a bounty on me! I saw it—he saw it!" I pointed at Jake. "My address was in a deep web post! Someone is literally paying to have me killed."

The younger officer sighed, clearly unconvinced. "Ma’am, unless you have direct access to that post, there’s no way to verify your claim. The dark web isn't exactly a place we can casually browse." His tone was detached, as if I was wasting his time.

"But what about the AI prompts? My poisoned milk? The car that almost hit me?" I realized I was sounding frantic, but fear clawed at my throat. I needed them to do something. *Anything.*

The older officer let out a slow breath. "We’ll file a report, alright? But you don’t have a suspect, and—" he waved a hand, "a damn computer ain't something we can slap cuffs on."

"Computer?" I echoed blankly, before it clicked. "You mean AI."

"Yeah, that," he said with a tired nod. "Look, lady, I get it—you’re scared. But we ain’t got an actual crime here. You didn’t drink the milk, you weren’t hit, and nobody broke in. Without solid proof, our hands are tied. I know it ain't what you wanna hear, but the best thing you can do right now is find somewhere safe to lay low. You got someone you can stay with for a few days?"

Jake jumped in before I could answer. "She can stay at my place."

That seemed to satisfy them. They took preliminary details, advised me to visit the station if I found more concrete evidence, and left.

But I wasn’t sure about going to Jake’s place. Something about it made me uneasy. **The AI's words echoed in my mind—‘Your close friend will betray you.’** I hadn’t known Jake that long—maybe a few months, give or take. Maybe I was being paranoid, or maybe my instincts were screaming for a reason.

Instead, my thoughts drifted to someone else.

Matt.

We had been together for four years before things fell apart. He wasn’t perfect—he had a temper, acted impulsively—but he wasn’t cruel. **I couldn’t picture him orchestrating something this elaborate just to hurt me.**

I pulled out my phone and, for the first time in months, called him.

He answered almost immediately. "Priya?"

I explained everything, my voice tight with panic. There was a long silence before he finally spoke.

**"Come to Hollow Pines."**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

Jake didn't like it.

As I packed, he lingered nearby, arms crossed. "Priya, you know what Matt did. He thought we had an affair. He slept with my girlfriend just to get back at us. He ruined both of us. And now you're running to him?"

I zipped up my bag, avoiding his gaze. "I just... I need to go. I need to think. And Hollow Pines is the only place that feels safe. We used to spend holidays there."

Jake sighed, rubbing his temples. "Fine. But be careful. And come back."

I hesitated for a moment before kneeling down to scratch behind Thunder's ears. "You'll be okay with Jake, right?" I murmured. The Lhasa Apso wagged his tail but whined softly. I looked up at Jake. "Take care of him for me, will you?"

Jake sighed again, running a hand through his hair. "You know he doesn’t like me much, but yeah, I’ll look after him. Just don’t take too long."

Hollow Pines was the lake house owned by Matt’s parents. The drive was two hours, but it felt like an eternity. My mind raced, trying to make sense of everything. Something was gnawing at me—some detail I couldn’t quite grasp. **Something that didn’t fit.**

I was sure now—someone was trying to kill me. The poisoned milk, the near accident, the AI prompts, the dark web bounty—it wasn’t just paranoia. But who?

It couldn't be the AI, could it? No, that was ridiculous. AI didn’t have free will, didn’t have motives. **Did it?** A shiver ran down my spine. The rational part of me knew better, but the events of the last twenty-four hours had shredded my sense of certainty.

Then who? And why?

Jake had been quick to offer me a place to stay. Too quick. But he had also been the one by my side through it all. And Matt… Matt had every reason to hate me, but would he go this far?

I had never cheated on him, not really. But I had been defiant, refusing to cut Jake out of my life when Matt demanded it. Was that just stubbornness, or was it something more? An emotional betrayal? Matt had always believed the worst, and I never gave him the reassurance he needed. Did that make me guilty in a different way? Did that make me someone worth destroying?

And then there was Jake’s ex. The woman Matt had slept with out of spite, convinced Jake and I had betrayed him. We had never spoken after that—she had no reason to hold a grudge against me. Or did she? The thought sent a fresh wave of unease through me. Was I so focused on the wrong people that I was missing the real threat?

My fingers tightened around the steering wheel. No answers. Just fear, curling in my stomach like something alive.

It was still dark when I reached the lake house, the faintest hint of dawn creeping over the horizon. Matt greeted me at the door, his expression tense but relieved.

"I wasn’t expecting you," he admitted, running a hand through his hair. "But it’s good to see you. Really."

The warmth in his voice was disarming. Inside, the scent of old books and pine filled the dimly lit living room, triggering a flood of memories.

"I owe you an apology," Matt said, his voice low. "I wasn’t in a good place when we broke up. I acted like an ass. I’ve been working on myself—therapy, journaling, all of it. I know I messed up. But I want to fix things. Maybe even... us."

The words settled around me, unfamiliar but not unwelcome. This was the Matt I had fallen in love with—the one who made the world feel safer. **For the first time in hours, I let myself relax.**

We sat by the fireplace, reminiscing over cheap beer. The warmth, the nostalgia—it was too easy to slip back into old comforts. My eyelids grew heavy.

Then, suddenly, I jolted awake.

A thought surfaced, sharp as a needle.

The last AI prompt: **‘You will be murdered, trapped in a lake house with an ex who wants revenge.’**

Murdered in a lake house. The coincidence was too precise. Too deliberate.

I turned my head slowly. Matt was still there, staring into the fire, his beer half-empty.

I forced a smile and stretched. "Hey, Matt... mind if I crash in the study? Just feeling a little off."

His eyes flicked to mine, and for a split second, something unreadable passed across his face. Then, he nodded. "Sure. Whatever makes you comfortable."

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

I retreated to the study, but not before making a detour to the kitchen. My fingers closed around the handle of a knife, **and I tucked it into my belt, hidden beneath my sweater.**

Inside the study, Matt’s laptop sat open on the desk, the screen dark. I hesitated before tapping the space bar. A login page flickered to life.

I tried an old password.

**Priya321.**

The screen unlocked instantly.

A sick feeling crawled up my spine as I clicked through the open tabs. And then I saw it.

A dark web post. A bounty. **My bounty.**

The username: **SupersaneJoker.**

And as I stared, a message flashed across the screen.

**Time left: 24 hours.**

My breath turned to ice. It wasn’t just paranoia. Matt must have made a key to my apartment. I took away his key when we broke up, but he can still have a duplicate key. He could have poisoned the milk. He could have orchestrated the car accident. **I had locked myself in a lake house with the person trying to kill me.**

The study door creaked open. I jumped.

"Priya?"

Damn it. I had forgotten to lock the door.

I turned slowly, forcing my hands behind me to shield the laptop. As I did, my fingers instinctively wrapped around the knife at my belt, pulling it free in one slow, deliberate motion. I kept it low, hidden behind my leg. "Yeah?"

Matt stood in the doorway; his silhouette framed in dim firelight. "I was wondering if you wanted a nightcap."

I hesitated. **There was something unsettling in the way he watched me—too still, too unreadable, as if weighing something in his mind.**

"No thanks," I said, my voice steady. "I’m just going to bed."

His eyes narrowed slightly. "You’re acting weird."

"Just tired."

He took a step forward. His gaze flicked past me—to the laptop. His expression shifted. **He knew.**

"What’s that?" he asked, voice tight.

My stomach lurched. "It was like that when I found it."

Matt frowned, stepping closer. **Too close.** "That’s not possible. I haven’t used my laptop today."

Panic surged through me. His gaze dropped slightly, his brow furrowing as his eyes locked onto something—my hand. A flicker of confusion crossed his face, then realization. His posture tensed, his breath hitching just enough for me to notice.

His expression twisted. "What the fuck, Priya?"

I didn’t wait. I slashed at his arm and ran.

I expected him to chase me, to grab me, to yell—but he didn’t. Instead, he just stood there, holding his wounded arm, watching me. **His face was unreadable—frozen in something I couldn't quite name.**

The eerie stillness made my skin crawl. **Why wasn’t he running after me? Why wasn’t he stopping me?**

I forced myself to think, to move. On my way out, I grabbed my phone and keys off the table, my fingers fumbling in my panic. Every second felt agonizingly slow as I stumbled toward the door.

My breath came in ragged gasps as I fumbled with my keys, my heart hammering against my ribs. Every second stretched unbearably long. I yanked the car door open, threw myself inside, and jammed the key into the ignition. The engine rumbled to life as I drove away from the house, hands gripping the wheel too tightly. When I finally dared to glance back, Matt was still standing in the doorway, the soft glow of the rising sun casting long shadows across his face. His expression was unreadable, his posture unnervingly calm.
