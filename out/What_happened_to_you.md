'I was getting ready for bed when I heard a rustling noise from my backyard, as I was home alone that night I decided to check it out as only my 2 puppies would be awake at night and I don't want them to be in danger.

I checked the rose bushes that surround the fence in my garden, Nothing was there.

As I was about to go back into my house I heard the rustling again, this time it was closer to me. I stopped moving, a force started gripping at my arms, I grew weak, then everything went dark.

I woke up in a room, It was too bright to see anything. I think it's a white room. I can just about make out a silhouette of a woman, I think she has long brunette hair. She's wearing a psychiatrist uniform. I'm not crazy. I don't have mental health issues. What is going on?

"Good morning Alexander. How are you feeling?" The psychiatrist asked, I can finally see her clearly, She has Brunette hair with emerald green eyes.

"W-who are you? and why am I here?!" I exclaimed, The brunette then explained that on THAT night I was attacked and got severely injured on my head and fell into a coma for a month or so, and apparently lost my memory. Wait, I think I know her, I think she's my ex-girlfriend.

"Anyway, would you like to go on a walk with me dear?" The psychiatrist questioned, she has a name tag on, it says that her name is Scarlet. I know Scarlet, She's my friend, not my ex-girlfriend. I nodded then I went to look at my clothes. They were white and grey. White is probably the worst colour to wear but I don't mind.

While me and Scarlet were on our walk, We saw other people, in the same position as I am. Everything went black again.' 

Someone finished reading everything in my diary. I was blindfolded and I think I was handcuffed to a chair. I can't move. I can't talk. I can't see. I'm shaking. I'm feeling as if I'm going to die. I am going to die. This is the end.

Suddenly, someone took the handcuffs of me and pulled me into a hug. Who is hugging me? I don't know. They take the blindfold of me. It's Scarlet. I try to talk but all that comes out is a screech. Scarlet assures me that I'm in safe hands. I don't believe her. I feel as if she's going to kill me. I try to push her away but all that happens is her tightening her grip. 

Scarlet pulls away from the hug and.. she gets shot.As her body falls to the ground, I started crying. "My- My friend" I stuttered. Her blood splattered all over me. I kneel down next to her limp body, holding her in a tight hug. I hold her more tightly as I feel a presence behind me. The presence of a killer. A man who just killed my best friend. He sits next to me. The man is... My Father? My 'father' spoke up, "She wasn't who you thought it was." The man beside me disappears. Scarlet disappears, but her blood remains on me. I take a look around the room. It's my bedroom. I wasn't here before. How'd I get here? Someone help me get out of this world.
