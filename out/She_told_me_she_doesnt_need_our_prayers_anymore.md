—and I believed her.

My family and I've always been devoted Catholics throughout my life. We've prayed rosaries every night, attended Sunday Masses, and I, personally, serve as an Altar Server in our parish and a parish pianist/choirmaster.

But no one is as devoted in our family as my grandmother, a loving and beautiful wife to my grandfather. Unlike me and my other family, who simply attend mass on Sunday, or for me, serve on Sundays or other special masses, my grandmother was different; she was simply that devoted.

She attended mass every day, not missing a single one in our parish, she often joined processions, novenas, and went to confession frequently. She was not like my parents, she was not like my siblings, and not even our grandfather. She was a Catechist who frequently taught in elementary schools on the Catechism and helped uplift others who doubted their faith or maybe, even returning.

That's just how devoted she is.

My grandmother passed away at one year ago, peacefully at the age of 81, and to this day, I still think of her, and she told us all one thing before she died, to continue praying for her soul and adding her to our personal prayers and intentions as well as mass being offered up to her.

So we did, we always did, we never forgot about it. Rosary? "Lord, we pray for the soul of Bernila Escasa..." Masses? We always go to the commentator every Sunday to add her to the list of prayers and intentions. And when the eucharist is being consecrated at mass, I always whisper her soul to be brought up.

And I never ever forget to pray the Chaplet of the Divine Mercy for her soul.

That's just how things went and one year later, we still found ourselves doing it... until I stopped for one reason.

I was praying the rosary alone in my our altar filled with sacred images of Mary, Crucified Jesus, my personal favorite Saints (Saint Bonaventure, Saint Ignatius, Saint Thomas of Aquinas), and even my grandmother's favorite saints (Our Lady of Fatima, Saint Therese, Saint Pope John Paul II, Saint Lorenzo Ruiz) and I was there in my usual routine, praying the rosary, it was Sunday so I was praying the Glorius mysteries.

And I felt a strange uneasy warmth in the room, something felt so warm as I prayed, and then I saw a light appear before our ceiling, a wind suddenly burst and blew the candles' fire out, and then... I saw her... she... appeared right before me...

I didn't know what to do, I thought I was just sleepy after that midnight service in the Easter Vigil, it was 9 PM and it ended late, I was exhausted at that time and I didn't know if that was just the case... but no... she appeared right before me and as if faith has it, on the time of Christ's resurrection, Easter Sunday.

Something inside me felt... strangely warm... I couldn't contain my tears... then she went close to me and said "Gabriel, my dear, thanks to all of you, I made it to heaven, I don't need your prayers anymore, I'm now with God, the blessed Mary, and all of his saints." and she vanished, I couldn't contain my tears anymore and just cried... I did it... she made it... She's no longer in purgatory.

 —or so I thought...

I believed her, my grandmother was not a liar, I genuinely believed she was now a Saint in heaven, and that I could pray to her like any other Saint, I believed she showed me.

My prayers became different, it wasn't for her soul but actual intentions now. I stopped praying for her soul, and I started praying to her and requesting prayers to her like any other Saint. I felt happy she was now in heaven, and it removed my doubts about God not existing.

I told my parents about it. At first, they couldn't believe me, until she appeared again... right in front of us saying what he told me too and that's when my family's doubts stopped, we stopped praying for her soul and prayed to her like a canonized Saint.

We prayed to her.

Her picture, once just a memory framed on the altar, became almost an icon. We whispered to her like we would Saint Joseph, entrusted intentions as if she sat beside Our Lady herself. It felt right. Itfelt good.

We were no longer praying for her.

That was a mistake...

Things started to change for the worst.. My mother began hearing knocks at night. My father grew angry for no reason. My little sister said grandma visited her too—but now with a face she couldn’t describe. The smell of roses at first... but then sulfur.

My parents started arguing now more frequently, it became a habit, and then for the first time, my mother slapped my Father...

—They never argued ever; if they did, it never got that intense.

That night I couldn't sleep. It just felt so uneasy. I prayed to her again at night, and this time, it didn't feel as warm as it once was before...

Then the dreams began.

I saw her again—but not with the peace I remembered.

This time, she was in a grey room, still and kneeling. There was no light except a faint, distant glow—red, flickering, as if from some fire too far to touch but too near to ignore. She didn’t speak. She didn’t move. Only her eyes met mine, and I swear to you, there was pain in them. Not an accusation. Notshame. Just... pleading.

I woke up drenched in sweat. I lay there in the dark, holding my breath, trying to convince myself it was nothing. A dream. My mind is just too tired. But something gnawed at me, something deep and slow. I didn’t tell anyone. Not my parents. Not even our parish priest when I assist on Sundays.

And over the next few weeks, I began to notice something. The house, once so alive with devotion and grace, began to feel… hollow. Not dead. But not alive either. The Rosary was still said every night, yes—but it felt different. Like we were going through the motions. Words without fire. My voice in the choir, once so full of longing and praise, trembled with something I couldn’t name. Even our home altar, surrounded by the saints and the candles, felt cold. Like they were watching. Waiting.

And then it happened.

I was at the altar alone one night. I lit the candles, knelt, and bowed my head.

“Saint Bernila… pray for—”

I couldn’t finish it. My voice caught. My tongue felt heavy. The air in the room shifted suddenly—colder, heavier. And then, with a sickening crack, the wooden crucifix on the wall above the altar fell. Just fell. The nails holding it hadn’t come loose. They were ripped from the wall. I heard them hit the floor.

I didn’t move. I couldn’t.

I just sat there, staring at it.

I was too shocked...

And that same night, I didn't go to bed, I went to my computer and found a file of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, I searched and searched and there, I found something that made my skin crawl...

"Each man receives his eternal retribution in his immortal soul at the very moment of his death, in a particular judgment that refers his life to Christ..." (CCC 1022)

And further:

"The Church does not canonize the dead through private revelation, but only after rigorous investigation, miracles, and with the authority of the Pope."

I realized the horror.

We had stopped praying.

We had presumed her salvation—an act condemned by the Church as presumption, one of the sins against the Holy Spirit. We had turned away from the sacred duty of intercession for the dead. We traded the hard labor of love for a comforting lie. Perhaps she had come to beg for prayers—and a darker thing came after to mock it.

Worse yet... we had begun asking for her prayers. If she were not in Heaven, to whom were we really praying to?

I flipped through the Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas, trembling at what I read in the Supplementum, Question 69:

"Some souls are detained in Purgatory for a long time not because of the greatness of their sins, but because they are not sufficiently prayed for by the faithful.

Then one paragraph caught my eye and struck me like a cold stone upon my chest:

“Although we may hope and trust in God's mercy, the Church does not presume to declare anyone a saint without solemn investigation, miracles, and proof of heroic virtue. The Church alone, guided by the Holy Spirit, has the authority to canonize.”

My hands trembled as I turned to the Rituale Romanum, which read:

"Apparitions, though possible, must be tested. For Satan, transformed into an angel of light, may deceive, especially those who grow proud in spiritual consolations."

Was that warm light really her? What have I done? Please tell me what to do, I don't know what me and my family have done anymore, I think we just cursed our house forever of the demon, please help me, help us, what do I do?  
  
Did… I… condemn her to hellfire? I… just don’t know… I’m… guilty…
