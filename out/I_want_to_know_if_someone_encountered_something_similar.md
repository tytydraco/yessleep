English isn't my first language, so I got some help from chat GPT

When I was little, from the age of 3 to 12, I was friends with jinn. I used to think I was just imagining it, but as I grew up and searched for confirmation, I found out they were jinn because they had the same characteristics, names, and behavior as my friends. A woman I met when I was older told me the same thing happened to her, and they acted the same way with her as they did with me.

Anyway, the things that used to happen, I'm not sure if they were astral projection or not, but they would sit me calmly on the ground, hold my hands, and walk with me. When I would look behind, I’d see my body still sitting there. They would take me to another land, in a different time, and we would fly in the sky. I saw creatures that were neither human nor animal... My memory is strong, but not to the point where I can remember details. I remember it like a broken record that keeps playing.

There were also demons that would chase me, but I didn’t know why. Several times I almost got abducted when I was little, and there was one who would appear in my dreams all the time. My friends would warn me about her, telling me to close my eyes and not look into her eyes if she appeared in my dreams or in real life.

All these memories are strange, but I’m sure they happened.

They were so short that when they stood, they could fit under the bed. Their limbs were long, and they didn’t look scary. They would bounce around the room like rubber balls. I still remember the first time I met them. I was at my uncle’s house, and my cousin told me he wanted to introduce me to them. I agreed, and then they appeared to me. They were hanging from the ceiling and under the beds. When I agreed, they began to come out of their spots. Since then, they became my friends.

The scary demon who would appear in my dreams, and whom my friends warned me about, would always come to me. The dream would seem normal at first, but suddenly a drawer, door, or cupboard would open, and the atmosphere would change. It would become cold and terrifying. Bubbles would start to appear from the opened cupboard and swirl around me. Her face would appear in the reflection of the bubbles, but I never saw her directly.

When the dream got to that point, I would freeze in fear, unable to breathe or run. Her face seemed normal, like that of a human—tall, wheat-colored, and not scary—but her presence and gaze were terrifying. She neither smiled nor frowned, and her face had no expressions, just a cold, chilling presence.

She didn’t speak, but I would hear a voice in my heart telling me her name was Salafa. The same dream would repeat over and over, with the same girl, the same coldness, the same stillness, and the same name. I would wake up from the dream, drenched in sweat, trembling, and with all due respect, I’d be so scared I would end up wetting myself.

Even now that I’m older, when I remember Salafa, I get chills in my body and feel a cold rush through me. I’m not sure what would happen if I saw her in real life, or what would happen if I looked directly into her eyes.

My whole life, I’ve been afraid to open a cupboard, drawer, or locked door, and I still don’t open them.
