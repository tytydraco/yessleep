Skinless angels flew by, becoming nothing but dots on the beautiful eye stabbing red of the limitless sky. 



I observed the morning train shooting at them occasionally as I sipped on my Irish coffee swinging back and forth on my old trusty chair. The creaking of old wood was the only sound besides the constant background music. The melody drilling into my ears. 



***EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE***



 My enjoyment of the warm feeling of blood flowing down my neck was interrupted by the robotic voice of the Inspector.



*Rules are Broken* 



*Rules are Broken*



*Rules are Broken* 



His speaker mouth declared as dead eyes stared at me, reflecting only the light of his aureola. 



*How, so? Are talkin’ ‘bout the damn Gurldes again? I fucking told ya, I ain't taking care of that. That between your lavalamp ass and the Club gang.*



I answered less than eloquently, greatly annoyed at my morning solitude being disrupted. 



*Rules are Broken* 



*Rules are Broken*



*Rules are Broken*



The Inspector pointed a glass finger at my backyard. I sighed and stepped off my porch feeling my naked feet sinking into the red void. 



*I’ ll be damned!* 



I exclaimed, staring at the pair of mouths right in the center of my backyard where my statue previously sat. Enormous tongues occasionally wetting lump lips. I blinked, not believing my eye. Groan escaped my mouth. Some Adjusted Runners must lay down in my back yard. 

  


 Smoking, I waited as an eyeball bigger than my house appeared. It looked at me. Colourful iris was sliced by my knife before I crawled inside, slogging through the white jelly.



I came on the other end to a forest of tower blocks with magenta sky and tails covering the ground as far as my limbs could reach.



Jumping into the fountain at the center brought me into the good old Mushbar. It was empty as usual. I walked to the counter. Azid H poured me a shot of pink liquid then they plucked green mushroom from their left shoulder and dropped into the glass, spilling some liquor on the fuzzy surface.



*Special drink for a special king! \~* ✩♤



They chirped looking down at me with mismatched eyes. I quickly broke eye contact so as not to get high from their hypnotic gaze less, I would find myself coupling with the Inspector inside Diamond tower. Giving my brother a near eye attack. The best teacher is your past. 



*I have anomaly* 



*No…a….na…o…ly* 



I heard the squeaky voice of Dukie behind me. I did not dare to look back at his malformed visage. Terrifying combination of clubawful Runner features and Gurldes.



*Great*. 



*With the Fourth One waking up, all the fun stuff is happening!*



Azid H. giggled, flicking their scaly neon pink tail. Thought seemed to come to them as they clapped.



*Oh! Maybe COC is pranking you?! My dad said Duke was suspiciously quiet recently.* 



*I ain't trustin’ anythin’ that snake says.* 



I waved my hand dismissively. Dukie agreed, melting into the cracks of tails leaving only clothes behind. Deciding staying in the bar any longer would end up with me intoxicated out of my Spade, I left with a heavy sigh. 



Coming back to my part of the void, I found it absolutely overflowing with Runners. I groaned having my laziness to blame but instead decided the Fourth One is the culprit.



Lighting a cigarette I rolled my sleeves up and got to catching the vermin,  putting them into one twitching pile. 



The relaxing melody of the void was replaced with mouth insistent chattering. On the verge of anger a brilliant idea came to my mind.



My tentacle swiftly picked up a new Runner. It was screaming, a sound quite welcoming. I throwed it into the gaping maw. It bit the runner into two pieces. Absolutely crushing my hopes, moments later it spit out the pest. Now the two halves crawl around. Dirtying the beautiful void.



I noticed a rectangular device. The Runner must have dropped it. Something made in Diamond Kingdom? Deciding I could at least try, I spent a while figuring out how to use the technology.



All I want is my peace in solitude to return yet as I write on this device, drinking Runner whiskey I keep hearing the insistent wet sounds of the two mouths kissing passionately. 



So does anyone know how to deal with them?
