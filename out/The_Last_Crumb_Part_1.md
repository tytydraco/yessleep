We all do it. Reach into the bag of chips with our hungry finger, searching out the last lick of salty flavour to finish our hurried snack. Then, inevitably, we toss our aluminium prey, sated for now, never thinking about the molecules left behind. Until recently, I’d never imagined what it might be like to be that last crumb. To be hunted down, then discarded. 

Now I do.

It was the height of summer in the city. The sun bounced off the steel buildings, pinged around large glass storefronts, and seemingly landed directly on my face as I attempted to serve customers coffee. Sweat pooled under my shirt in my lower back, and my cap could no longer contain my overt perspiration, as beads of liquid streamed past my temples. 

“I’m so sorry for the heat, ma’am” I apologised to the flustered customer, who was getting redder every second, a combo of both heat and anger. “Our A/C has been on the fritz, can I offer you an ice water on the house?” 

“Sure, but it’ll boil over soon enough” she muttered under her breath, accepting my meagre compensation as she accepted defeat and shuffled down the counter. 

I understood her frustration, but part of me wanted to rip off my soaked hat, throw it in her face and scream “try working for eight hours for minimum wage in this sweatbox!” Alas, it wasn’t in my nature. It was too hot to bother anyway. 

More sticky hours passed, dozens of iced coffees passed slickly from my hands to the patrons, and finally it was time to call it a day. 

“See you tomorrow boss”, Moira yelled as she whisked herself out the door, desperate to get away from the heat and the closing shift duties. Boss is a stretch—I’m the assistant manager but that title only comes with a paltry pay-rise and more responsibility. I set about cashing up and locking doors, when I noticed something as I cleared the long forgotten corner table. 

A large gnarled brown mug sat squarely in the centre of the table, looking strangely like the bark of a tree, seemingly untouched yet empty. I stared at it for a second. It was far too humid today for anyone to have ordered a hot drink, and besides, our mugs are white and boring, not like this ornate nature-inspired ceramic. Inspecting it further, I lifted the mug, unsurprised to find it empty of liquid but not completely void of contents. 

At the bottom was a small bean. Green and shaped like the offspring of a coffee bean and a cashew. Without thinking I pocketed it in the pouch of my apron, placed the mug in the dishwasher, and finished my nightly duties before closing the shutters and heading home.

Morning came with some relief. I had the day off and I was about to spend all day doing my favourite thing - gardening. I lived in a ground floor apartment, rented from a wealthy second cousin and therefore affordable for my crappy salary. The best part about it was the small garden adorning the back, only accessible from my apartment. The weather had cooled impressively overnight, and I armed myself with gloves, trowels, spades, and seeds, and set about preparing my modest summer crop of veggies and flowers. 

After a couple of hours, I took a break, knees aching from kneeling and dirt rubbed on my face from careless swiping of my brow, and sat with a lemonade on my back porch, surveying my work so far. 

It was wash day, and I’d laid some of my clothes out to dry on the rack outside, taking advantage of the season. Suddenly I remembered—that weird seed! I placed my lemonade on the floor next to me, leaving a few drops at the bottom of the glass, and glanced over at my apron. Surely the seed wasn’t still in the pouch? It was. 

Perhaps high on the scent of fertiliser and weed killer, I decided to plant it in a special pot I’d picked up at a garage sale last fall, giving it pride of place right next to the back window. I was excited about what it might grow, but not naïve enough to recognise that it probably wouldn’t grow at all, and was most likely some weird candy I’d never seen before. 

Still, a few hours later I was pleased with my gardening work. Only a few seeds remained in the zip lock baggie I used to keep them in, kept alive by the hope they may end up in the soil along with their buddies someday. I went inside to take a shower, binge watch TV, and order a pizza. A reward for a job well done. 

I always save the pizza crusts for last. I like to use them to wipe up the pizza grease and any cheese that escaped the first culling. I know it sounds gross. Tonight I was too tired to finish though, and left one solitary crust alone, doomed to be trashed without any pastry brethren by its side. 

I yawned, threw the blanket off my lap and made my way to the bedroom. The couch was often my bed on the weekend when I was too lazy to move, but tonight something compelled me to head to my bed and get a good night's sleep.

I awoke to heavy rainfall. So thunderous it reminded me of machine gun fire, and jolted me awake in a panic. I swung my legs out of bed, padded over to the window, and opened the curtains. Great sheets of rain were bathing the city, so thick were the drops that it made it hard to see shapes. Oh well, I thought. Rain will be good for my crops. 

With that thought, I went back to sleep, dreaming of a huge, lush garden where I could forget my dull life, surrounded by exotic flowers of all colours and shapes, so many that I could lay back and disappear forever within their rainbow of petals. 

\---

Bleary eyed and aching, the sunlight streaming through the window woke me earlier than I’d have liked. I rubbed my sore calves–clearly I overdid it with the gardening. Rubbing my eyes, I slouched my aching feet into my slippers and made my way to the kitchen for a caffeinated pick-me-up. 

What I saw was entirely unbelievable.

Just beyond the kitchen window, the strange seed had shot up overnight, producing a large, thick green stalk; it must have been 3 feet wide. I ran outside to get a closer look, and craned my neck to take in its monstrous height. The plant stretched into the sky, beyond the clouds, and it sprouted spikes every foot or so up the stalk. Almost like a ladder, but one that resembled a terrifying monster-cactus rather than something used for cleaning the gutters. 

As I stared up at the horrifyingly huge plant, I stopped to notice the weather. It was still, cool, yet a mist was descending over my garden and the city skyline. A sudden breeze swept over me, humming as it did so. I couldn’t hear any words, but something within that wind was whispering to me. Compelling me to climb the plant and discover what lay at the peak. 

Without missing a beat, or changing out of my PJs, I placed a hand on one of the protruding spikes, and lifted myself up, one spine at a time. As I climbed higher, seeing the roof of my apartment building much faster than I anticipated, I noticed my hands becoming slicker. The spines had been sticking me with smaller spikes, leaving my hands bleeding from numerous tiny holes. Somehow I couldn’t feel the pain, or didn’t want to. All I wanted to do was climb. 

As I entered the clouds, the air became thinner, leaving me gasping with every stretch to reach the next spike with my bloodied fingers. But eventually, I made it to a plateau, where the tree extended into a large green surface. I collapsed at the top, and didn’t recover in time to notice what was approaching me. As I lay on my side, gasping for air, a large shadow covered me before I could collect myself. 

Turning around slowly to the sound of deep, guttural breathing, I saw him. A giant of a man, 20 feet tall at least, with rippling muscles bursting through his tattered clothing. I froze in fear, and stayed frozen as he wordlessly picked me up with no effort at all, and carried me across the green landscape to a large hole in the ground. 

Survival instincts kicked in. I knew I had no chance to overpower him but I began kicking my legs as hard as I could into his ribs (gardening injuries permitting), and flailing my arms to escape his grip. It was no use, he didn’t even react to my attempts, despite me using all my strength. His dark eyes didn’t stray from his path. 

\---

He dropped me into the hole. It was deep, dank, and stunk of manure and death, and I landed with a thud that made me yelp with pain upon impact on the hard dirt floor. He leaned over the hole, stared at me for a few seconds, then walked away, his footsteps shaking the floor. 

The walls of the hole were jagged, but the mud was too slippery to try to climb, as I learned almost immediately. 

The walls cast shadows against the corners, shadows that were hiding secrets.
