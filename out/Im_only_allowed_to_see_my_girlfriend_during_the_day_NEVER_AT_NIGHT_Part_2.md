**Part Two**

Thanks for your patience. Had a health issue that came up where my lungs filled up with fluid but I’m lucky to have the best team of nurses and caregivers who, although they are unable to push off the impending touch of death’s hand, aid in getting me well enough to write this warning. Everyone around me knows getting out these pages is this dying old man’s purpose and I’m grateful for the people, pills, and everything poked and prodded into me that helps me fulfill this mission. When I left off, I was driving out of Tuxedo Park. Below is my account of what happened afterwards. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 

I wait two days to reach out to Jean, maybe three. I call out of work too. I am in a state of shock from what I have just witnessed. It’s impossible to close my eyes without seeing that demonic face. My fear is so overwhelming that it overshadows the fact that I’m also suffering a broken heart. I don’t have the tools to process that I am paralyzed in a state of PTSD and the one person I would normally go to for comfort is also the reason for my PTSD. I am wrought with fear that something has happened to Jean and that prevents me from calling sooner. Finally, I heed the advice my dad, my Nonno, and generations of men before me would tell me to do if they knew the state I was in. “Buck up and be a man.” I tell work I’ve come down with a bug and I’ll be in tomorrow. Then I call Jean’s house. 

Doug picks up. “Hello?” He sounds about as down as I am. This is strange for Doug, the glass-half-full counterpart to my little sister. 

“Hi Doug. Just calling to check in on Jeanie. And you and the baby.” 

There is a long pause. Then bewildered and spent, he relays, “We lost the baby. And Jean is… is…”

I can’t take the waiting, and I verbally shove Doug as if growing frustrated with the poor guy is going to force a better answer more quickly. “What the hell is going on with my sister?” 

Doug breaks down. Like me, he too is holding a lot in. “Jean’s not okay. She thinks… something took the baby… I know how crazy that sounds…” A muffled sob cuts through the silence. He's covering his mouth to keep from crying “You know Jean, when she gets something into her head— she really thinks this happened and... I can’t— can’t convince her otherwise.” Once he has gotten this out, he chokes back more tears.

I soften my tone. “Can I please talk to her?” I beg. 

“She’s not here. The night we lost the baby she was so convinced that it was… the— thing… a monster…” 

There is so much shame and hesitancy in his voice when he tries to explain what Jean experienced. Right then, I want to tell him she’s not crazy, I saw the evil – I saw my girlfriend transform into the demon less than a mile from their house. I want to scream into the phone: “Whatever Jean saw, trust her. It’s real.” But I can’t. Although these abundantly real events are unfolding before my very eyes, I still don’t know if I can trust what I saw that night in the corn field. I refuse to admit, even to myself, that what I saw was real. Accepting that Elisa transforms into a demon at night is a reality I am not ready to face. Because if I do… it means I am responsible for the loss of Jean and Doug’s child. It means that there is no such thing as a future with the woman who, last week, I believed I would spend the rest of my life with. 

Doug continues, “What Jean thinks she saw— messed with her head so much— that she tried to— take her own life.” He cries longer, before stopping himself, and doing what his dad, his grandfather, and generations of men before him would tell him to do if they knew the state he was in. He bucks up. “I took her to the hospital nearby and they put her in a sort of holding. She’s there now.” 

I get the address. I tell him everything is going to be okay. This is a lie; I have no idea that it will and my gut tells me it won’t. But it’s all I can give Doug right now even though it is nowhere near enough. 

I drive back up to Tuxedo Park. Even in daylight, the glimpses of the main street on the way to the hospital make me relive the panic and terror from the last time I was here. I see each minute of everything that happened in the corn field again and again. By the time I pull into the address, I am shaking and pale. I splash some water on my face, shove everything down, and prepare to see Jean.

“Holding” is some real padded walls, loony bin shit. Several patients I pass mutter to themselves. Holding unearths another level of more realistic fear. Let’s say, you’re confronted by something your mind can’t handle — in a corn field or maybe in a battlefield - this sterile, inhumane, abusive cell block…is one of your better options.

Jean is in an actual straitjacket and because there are rather deep scratches all over her face, I understand why. She looks like death. She barely acknowledges my presence when I enter the padded room. I request that they bring in a table and chairs, and when I palm the orderlies twenties, boom, request granted. Jean is being treated like an animal, which is most likely not helping better her state. I naively hope that this attempt at civility might remind her of her humanity, even momentarily. I try to further bribe the orderlies to have her straitjacket taken off but I’m rebutted with some head shakes and a “no can do.” 

I take a seat and she sits across from me. 

“Hi Jeanie,” I say. 

She doesn’t respond. 

“I am so, so sorry you lost the baby.” I hang my head down when I say this. I don’t know why but I can’t look her in the eye. 

She softly cries and moves her cheek toward her shoulder to wipe her falling tears. Saying this is difficult to watch is the understatement of the century. I offer her my sleeve and move my arm toward her face to help her— 

“Stay the hell away from me.” She stiffens and backs her chair up.

“Okay, okay, I was only trying to help.” 

“This is your fault.” She spits out. Not venomously, but factually. 

“I know. I know.” Although I have no idea, I somehow can feel she is right. I make my voice slow. “I can’t imagine how hard it must be, but can you tell me what happened that night?” As terrified as I am to pull this thread, I need to know. I owe Jean this. 

And for a little while, Jean seems to find a coherence of mind; she remembers who she is. She straightens her posture and takes a breath. “I was getting ready for bed and Doug was in the other room watching the game. It wasn’t too late, but it was already dark and I get tired earlier and earlier these days. Or I did…” 

For a second, the loss of her baby hits her. She gives herself some brief seconds to grieve, but then she does the female version of “buck up,” and moves on. My heart breaks for her. But Jean is strong. She keeps going.

 “Then I lay in bed and I’m falling asleep, but this thing… it’s like a snake, but it’s a deep blood red… it comes down from the ceiling, no, the roof, and it’s heading straight for the baby. I think I’m in that bizarre in-between where I’m asleep and dreaming but it feels like I’m awake… I’m thinking: *this is onnnnne trippy nightmare*… But then the snake thing is hovering right over my stomach, and it opens its mouth… but it’s not a regular snake mouth… it’s this monstrosity with no eyes, wider than an open palm, and the whole mouth is lined with thin, razor-sharp teeth…” 

Her breaths grow more trepidatious with each sentence. The horror of reliving the experience of facing evil and then the courage to push through it and share what you have witnessed… what Jean is brave enough to do that day has taken me almost forty years to get out. But like I said, she is the stronger one. She goes on. 

“That mouth, the razor teeth, they bite down into my stomach. Hard. And fuck, the pain. I’ve never felt pain like that before. It’s like someone took hundreds of needles and stabbed you with them all at once, but then each of those needles grows its own hundred needles and those are stabbing you too. And they are all sucking the life… out of me. The baby out of me. It feels like I am being torn in half. 

And I’m being lifted off the bed but for some reason I can’t scream. Everything is being drained from me too fast. And this monster is lifting me off the bed… I’m thinking, Jesus-Mary-and-Joseph, **this isn’t a dream at all… this is real… this is happening**… I try to fight it but it’s so strong. And it’s wet. It’s like… a tongue. I dig my fingers into it, but it doesn’t flinch. And I’m too weak. I can’t protect me or my baby no matter how hard I fight… I know how this must—” 

Before she can finish, I interrupt, I need her to know, “I believe you.” Everything stops. 

“You do?” She’s in disbelief. “If you can help me take this off, there are these marks where the thing bit me— You can hardly see them but they’re there— Doug says he saw them— ask Doug.” She goes on, each word twisting on itself. She is sane enough to know how fucking crazy it all sounds. 

“I believe you.” I repeat. I probably say it a few more times. I have no idea how this tongue is connected to Elisa, but Jean is a straight shooter if there ever was one and if she says this happened, it did. 

“Once the thing has sucked everything from me,” she braces herself, “ripped my baby out of me… It drops me back onto the bed and it… recoils… back to the roof. Then, I scream. I can finally scream, and Doug comes running in.” 

The only thing I can be thankful for is that this is the end of the story – or so I think. I know it must have been brutal to live through, but helplessly listening to the people you love going through hell and back is its own special kind of torture. She looks off despondently and resigned. Not dead yet, but how Jean looks – well, like she had had the life sucked out of her. Then she speaks into a vacuum, like she’s going to the sunken place in that movie *Get Out.* She was here, but she’s moving further and further away. 

“Doug says he believes me but I know he doesn’t. There is a crack in the ceiling and the roof… where the tongue came in… Doug thinks he remembers the crack must have been there before.” 

Then she goes wild-eyed. A memory seems to be possessing her and it is taking over rapidly. There is something menacing about her. Her eyes relax and an uneven smile eerily spreads across her face. “The thing that attacked me… that… animal. It wasn’t human…" 

“ENOUGH.” It’s out of my mouth before I know I said it. But I can’t listen to Jean talk about her that way. 

“What?” Jean insinuates. Then she gets up and encircles me. Pacing around me to show her dominance. My frailty. Elisa’s culpability. In its own chilling way, Jean gets close to my ear and hisses, “That’s what it is. *An animal*. But while it was taking so much from me…*It left its imprint on me*… It was showing itself to me: showing me how to find… *Her*.” 

Now Jean looks so petrified, she’s losing her breath. Must have been how I looked that night in the corn field. And then Jean comes undone. “Her face… her face… The devil… IT’S HER!” 

She forcefully thrashes and violently SLAMS her head on the edge of a chair. She rises up and a trail of blood comes down, dividing her face in two. Before orderlies rush in, she gets in another SMASH to the side of her head. More blood. One tries to restrain her, then another comes in to help. They hold her down and subdue her. And I sit there and watch. When she’s sedated, I back out of the room.

Before she’s finally subdued, Jean fights to shriek, “IT’S HER! IT’S HER!”. 

I get myself out of this place as urgently as I can. My cowardice is revolting. 

Later that night, when I’m home alone, I have a dark night of the soul. There’s no such thing as caller ID or iPhones, but it doesn’t matter, I have an idea of who is calling my landline and what they have to say. I ignore the phone calls and collect deeper into myself. I know that everything that happened is entirely my fault, but I’m too small to accept responsibility. I don’t sleep. 

For the next week, I have two modes: “awake” and awake but with my eyes closed. Throughout it all, I think of Elisa. In human form. And every time, always when I least expect it… this cozy bouquet of reminiscences gets sawed apart by FLASHES OF THE DEMON. Despite it consistently being interrupted, dreaming of her and fondly recounting the sheltered, innocent interactions of falling in love is the only thing that seems to bestow upon me any escape. 

Even though I am still primarily in disbelief, some pieces of Elisa begin to make sense. The rule of never seeing her at night. The scars. Even our last fight, the last time I saw her in her kitchen and I asked her what she does at night, and she replied, “I eat.” I can’t affirm the fact that she is a monster, *if* she is a monster… but I connect dots. Looking back, I am sifting through every moment with her and holding it up to the light of truth. Or was it a lie? *Was the ladies’ high tea where she overheard of the company in financial distress a lie? Was her passing on this information, helping me move up in my career, was that a lie too? Why? Every time she told me she loved me, was she lying?* 

At work the next day, I’m a ghost. In a shell. I’m a mess. I can’t keep my calls straight. I go outside and smoke cigarettes. I don’t smoke. I’m clumsy. I haven’t actually slept, like really sleep, since I saw her transform, and that was… three… or was it four days ago? I reach for the phone. I tell myself: don’t call her. Yet I continue to dial. RING, RING. The ring of a real phone, they were called landlines back then, still are. 

She picks up. I don’t know it, but I’m smiling. 

“Hello?” Elisa questions. She knows it’s me. We can read each other’s minds like that. 

After everything that’s happened this week, I can’t bring myself to talk. I just listen to her breathing on the other end and something about it makes me feel better. I forgot she could make me feel that way. 

“I know it’s you, Will.” 

I get sad. A thought bubbles up: This has gone too far… I’ve seen too much… It’s never going to go back to me and Elisa. “Elisa and I”, she would correct. The woman speaks nine languages and I don’t speak English good. That was a joke. Anyway, it hits me like a ton of bricks; this might be the last time I ever talk to her. It’s really over. 

She goes on. “I hope you’re okay. Though I have a feeling you’re not. I called your mom. Sorry. She’s worried about you too. Just call her back, okay? I know we’re not seeing each other anymore, but that doesn’t mean I don’t care about you, Will. I love you.” 

I hang up.

“You look like shit,” Smithson, one of the higher-ups, comments to me walking by. He’s not wrong. 

I’ve already lost Elisa, I can’t lose my job on top of that. I decide then and there to let this all go and try to plug up my sinking ship, steer it toward healthier waters. I beg one of the guys for a tranquilizer, anything that will let me sleep. I start taking them every night. I still have my nightmares, but in the cold light of day I can function and when I can’t, I get good at faking it. 

For the next year, I focus into work. I get into racquetball and play at the most elite of clubs to improve my connections and social standing. I get a new place on the Upper East Side. Yeah it’s bigger but the main reason I do this is because every nook and cranny of my apartment reminds me of Elisa. I get all new furniture, but for some reason I can’t bring myself to get rid of the ring. 

As the seasons change, Jean moves from holding to a mental health institution, and then eventually back home to Tuxedo Park. She spends most of her days fairly sedated from a steady dose of pills but her doctors say she’s making progress. Smithson tries to set me up with one of his wife’s friends, a pretty gal, Kelly. We go out a few times, sleep together a few more, but she’s no Elisa. She eventually breaks it off. I don’t blame her; it’s pretty obvious I’m trying to fill a void. 

The only way I can get through the day is by pretending Elisa never happened. I implant a new reality into my husk of a man: one where I never met her, never fell in love with her, never saw what I saw in the corn field. Like the sleeping pills, I still dream about her, but in the cold light of day I can function and when I can’t, I get good at faking it. 

My birthday rolls around. Smithson and the boys ask me to dinner, I tell them I’ll be with family. My mom wants to cook for me, I tell her I’ll be with Smithson and the boys. Really, I just want to be alone. As I finish up the day at my desk, while the sun is still out, my phone rings. It’s *her*. 

“Happy Birthday, Will.”

I’m so surprised, I make myself talk. “You remembered.” 

“Always,” she says. 

“I’m sorry I was such an ass,” I admit. The last few months have given me time to think: while I might never be able to scrub my memory of her, in this moment I can atone for my stupidity. 

“Apology accepted. I know you were hurt and I’m sure Jimmy goaded you,” she returns. 

*Huh?* “Thanks”, I say because I don’t know else to respond with. 

“Anyway, have a good birthday. Take care of yourself.” Then she hangs up. 

I stand at my desk, confused and disoriented by the unexpected call. *How did she know about what happened with Jimmy?* I realize I can find out the answer to that right now. I make my way to Jimmy’s trading desk. He’s not there. Figures, he’s probably off having a martini with the boys. I gather my things to take the train home. No, I’ll walk. It’s a few miles and I’m in the wrong shoes, but I need to burn these blazing thoughts off. 

The more the phone call settles in, the less I can pretend a world without Elisa is real. Everything reminds me of her. I’ll see a woman with long black hair and think of her. A pantsuit in a store window and smile. I see a group of Filipina nannies talking and try  to understand their *tsismis* (gossip). I can make out a little…I decide because it’s my birthday, for one night, I let myself think of her and remember the way she, we, used to be. Tomorrow, I’ll go back to pretending she’s not there, but tonight she is alive inside me. She never left.

 I go home and gaze at the engagement ring; I imagine it on her slender fingers. Then I walk to Bahay Ko, the Filipino restaurant, and order her favorite foods, dishes that quickly became my favorites too: pancit, lumpia Shanghai, and finish it all off with halo-halo (the most delectable ice cream, beans (trust me it works), jellies, all mixed together in a dessert).

There are paper table covers and I have a pen in my back pocket so I begin to sketch her. I loved drawing when I was a kid and I had to take an art credit in college which helped to fine tune my ability. I get lost in sketching out Elisa’s elegant face, the contours of her body, her shapely legs… 

Soon the owner, Carmelita, an older, motherly woman, comes to collect my check. 

"Did you enjoy the food, *Pogi* (\*handsome)?” she asks. 

“Oh Carmelita, everything was delicious! I’m Will, by the way. I can’t believe you remember my girlfriend’s nickname for me.” I keep everything in the present intentionally and this woman affirming my delusion feels marvelous. 

“I know, Will, because you are pogi.” She pats my shoulder as she picks up the check. Her affection feels genuine and caring. Then she gulps and her eyes magnify. She’s frozen, staring at my sketch on the table. 

“The Manananggal,” she whispers. 

“The what?” I ask. 

“She’s a monster in the Philippines. Like a vampire. How do you know of her?” She points and touches my drawing. 

I look down. **I haven’t drawn Elisa at all. Instead, I have unknowingly, subconsciously sketched the demon from the corn field: the corpse-like skin, the wings, the monstrous face, the black eyes…**

 “This is a ***real*** monster?” I anxiously inquire. 

“Very real. I encountered her when I was a little girl in Cavite. You have seen her too?” 

I nod and Carmelita puts her hand over mine with great concern. “God help you, Will. I didn’t know she was here in the states.”

 \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 

The next day I live in reality. Not the one where Elisa never happened, or the one where I pretend I’m still with her, but actual reality, where what I saw in the corn field is something other people have seen too. Since that night, a small part…no, a large part… of me has believed I lost my mind. And Jean lost hers too. Maybe it’s genetic? But Carmelita’s words remind me: I am sane and what happened really happened. Elisa is a Manananggal. 

My new modus operandi makes me sharper than ever as I go through the day. After lunch, Smithson calls me into his office and gets right to the point. 

“Hey Will, I know you have a lot on your plate, but…” 

“Throw it at me,” I urge. Right now, I want all the distraction I can get.

“Great!” He’s relieved. “We need to split up Jimmy’s Rolodex and we’re wondering if you can take a share.” 

Oh gosh. Fucking Jimmy. In as diplomatic of a way as I can manage, I tell my boss, “I’m a team player and happy to pitch in, but I’m not picking up the slack of a drunk. Jimmy can do his own damn work.”

 Smithson sighs and rubs his temples. “Will. Jimmy died in the hospital this morning. Not a lot is known about how, except it was all very sudden. He’s from a good family and his folks want to keep this all very hush-hush until they know more. So if you could help keep this discreet, we’d appreciate it.” 

I’m stunned. I tell Smithson, “I’ll take as much of his client list as you wanna give and of course I’ll keep this quiet.” 

He hands me a stack of Rolodex cards and I take them to my desk. I quietly go through them one by one. Thank heavens I don’t have Elisa. 

Later I am so unnerved, I take a smoke break. Despite Smithson’s warnings to keep Jimmy’s death discreet, spooked whispers still circulate. I keep to myself and don’t engage but a thread on the patio pricks my ears: 

*“My cousin, she’s a nurse in the ER at Mount Sinai, and she says Jimmy died of the same thing that Old Fashioned did…”* 

Old Fashioned was the nickname for the CEO of the company Elisa told me about. It was his favorite drink, I guess... So Jimmy died of blood loss a day after Elisa somehow knows he “goaded” me on. Old Fashioned died the same way, two days after Elisa tells me he’s fudging his company’s financials. The dots I’m connecting are hard to ignore. For the first time since our break up, I’m actually glad that we’re not together. The people who directly cross paths with Elisa seem to have an early and brutal expiration date. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 

When I get home later that night, I decide it’s time to sell the engagement ring. Maybe Christie’s will buy it back or I can find a jewelry dealer to take it off my hands. I throw it in my briefcase and open up the yellow pages. For those of you who don’t know, the yellow pages is a thick directory of every shop that provides a service and their number and information. It’s like old school, paper Yelp! As I look through the jeweler section, my phone rings. 

“Hi honey!” It’s Mom and she sounds like she used to before Jean’s mental break. 

“Hi Mom, is everything okay?” 

“Oh sweetie, it’s better than okay. At long last, our family has a reason to celebrate! Your sister’s pregnant again!” She’s so happy I can feel it through the phone. 

I’m overjoyed. I’d hoped Jean would recover but remained cautiously skeptical. She’s the strong one. I can start to picture our lives rebuilding from the wreckage. 

“Sometimes prayers really do get answered,” Mom pronounces. 

“This is one of them,” I reply. 

When we hang up, I fall to my knees and thank God. I’ve never been much for prayer, but gratitude should be reserved for moments like this. It’s nothing short of a miracle. Jean and Doug have a second chance and I’m elated for them. Then a chilling darkness trickles through me. I have to protect Jean and the baby. I can’t let Elisa get them. Jean won’t survive it. My family won’t either. 

Tonight I skip the tranquilizers. I can’t forgo any mental acuity tomorrow. I’ll get up early and attack the day. I have a new directive: **find out how to kill Elisa.** 

Even with the addition of Jimmy’s clients, I work with an unprecedented speed and focus. When I’m done, I take the train to the New York Public Library and collect all the books I can find on Filipino mythology and legends. Legends my ass. I rapidly scour the glossary for any information on the Manananggal. Carmelita was right, I sketched the demon with the accuracy of someone who had real experience with her. Everything is exact except—I failed to draw her long serpentine tongue. This is what she uses to drill into roofs and attack her victims from above. She devours her victims by sucking the blood out of them, her favorite being the fetuses of pregnant women. I don’t need a book to tell me what Jean lived through, but seeing the truth printed and bound gives me a fortitude that I never thought I’d need. 

She can’t die in sunlight. *Well I knew that.* A stake through the heart won’t kill her. T*hank God, because I don’t know if I could do that to Elisa. Not in human form, and sure as shit not in demon form.* The only thing that kills the Manananggal is finding their lower-half, which she keeps hidden, and throwing salt over it. This will kill the upper-half as it flies around. I put my faith in this solution. Everything else in the books has been proven true and I pray this salt will slay the demon once and for all. The sun is already down so I’ll have to wait for tomorrow. 

My colleagues at the bank think I’m gunning for employee of the freaking year. No joke, guys are pulling me aside and asking me if I’m taking anything to give me my edge and where they can get it. Two years later, Tom Wolfe will release *Bonfire of the Vanities* where he terms men who do what I do “Masters of the Universe”. Wolfe comes up with this idea while observing me. In these forty-eight hours while I’m plotting to kill my ex so that my family can survive, I learn something so invaluable to my career it makes me rich beyond measure. I’m about to die and since there’s no better time to pay it forward, here’s the trick: Having a purpose far greater than money, gives one a wieldy laissez-faire attitude which, in turn, allows other wealthy people to entrust one with their money. Yes, it’s grossly ironic and the hardest part is finding that purpose. On this day of work, I make deals and speak every word like it is my last. If my measly money moves work, yippee ki-yay! If they don’t, I could be dead tonight. 

I finish up around 2:30 and tell my assistant I’ll get to the rest of today’s business tomorrow, if there is one. Early this morning, I picked up a Chevrolet Cavalier with Massachusetts plates. This is the most popular car in 1985 and I need every advantage I can get. 

In the car, I change into sweatpants, a sweatshirt, and another trusty baseball cap, a Red Sox one. I am dumb enough to think the Sox cap may throw off any suspicion Elisa might have on the road. I even don a sticky mustache from an old Mr. T Halloween costume. I look like a real dork, but another real dork. 

This is going to be different from the last time I tailed Elisa. First off, that was in summer, 1985. It was hot and the sun set later. It’s now October, a year later, the high is fifty-eight, and today the sunsets earlier. By 6:30, it will be completely dark. 

Same drill, I head to her building on Central Park South and tuck the Cavalier in the back of the taxis. As I watch Elisa exit, a long black coat covering jeans, I notice another key difference: Ronaldo is standing outside the Benz. He hands her the keys and walks away. Tonight, Elisa will be driving. 

This slight deviation from the itinerary is enough to scare the living bejesus out of me. I’m scared out of my mind already, but somehow Elisa driving solidifies the fact that there is so much I don’t have control over tonight and one wrong move means my death. I wonder if my heart will actually stop from fear, or if it will continue to beat as the demon siphons every drop of blood from me. How long until I die? While I am terrified of dying, especially in this barbaric way… I am most petrified of what will happen to Jean if I die and no one is left to protect her. 

On the road, I hang far back from Elisa, who is a shrewder driver than Ronaldo. She constantly checks her mirror to make sure she’s not being followed. Every time I am close enough to notice this, my anxiety spikes. I am given a sliver of solace when—instead of crowed highways—she takes the FDR… to the Queens Midtown Tunnel… to 495 East. She’s not heading to Tuxedo Park. She’s making her way to Long Island. 

I’ve made the mistake of getting too close though. She checks her mirror and stares directly at me. SHIT. Then she expertly cuts across the lanes and takes the next exit. I have no choice but to follow… All the while she uses her eyes to drill into me. *This a test.* 

I abruptly try to take the same exit, but incompetently do so. Lots of long honks and “Fuck you”s and one “Are you trying to kill me?” I see Elisa pulled over at a gas station, not pumping gas. She’s waiting for me. I pass her. I can’t get caught. I pull into a random driveway a few doors down, get out of the car, and walk into a stranger’s backyard. The children playing on a swing set yell “stranger!” when they see me. I run back to my car. 

Elisa is no longer at the gas station and I speed back onto 495, where I pray she will be. I realize we’re in Queens and she probably can’t stop in such a populated area – more people to notice a half-woman demon-beast on their roof. When I get back on the highway and see her car further up, I thank my lucky stars and keep more distance between us. 

The sun has nearly set when she exits somewhere in Glen Cove. I’m having trouble breathing now. I am so far back, it’s hard to follow her. No more Sox cap, I’ve put on an overcoat and a ski cap. When the roads get more rural and emptier, I wait longer to follow. Each turn feels like a round of Russian roulette. 

Sweet Jesus, I find her car parked in front of an apple orchard. I keep going and park far, over two miles up the road. Now that I know the dreadful sequence of events, my plan is to hide out in my car for the transformation, then wait for her upper-half to fly away… Then finally, I make my way back to the orchard and search for her lower-half. Kill her with salt. Drive off knowing my loved ones are safe. I am so naive. 

It is dark now. Only a half-moon tonight which will make the search-and-destroy part harder. I am crouched down on the floor of the back seat of the Cavalier, each passing second is a frightful eternity. The bag of salt I am clutching onto slips from my clammy palms. Then high above me, I see the demon tear through the darkness, wings and shredded organs backlit by the half-moon. And seeing her for the second time makes it no less terrorizing. It’s taking everything I have to contain my raw, unrelenting panic. Once I am able to do so, I walk out of the car and head back to the orchard.

In what feels like the longest walk of my life, I make it to the orchard, when an unthinkable, unforeseen horror besets. The demon is swooping back. I run for the cover of the nearest apple tree which, in the dead of fall with shriveled leaves and no fruit, is barely any cover at all. She is sweeping over the autumn orchard, scanning for the prey half-witted enough to believe he was the hunter. I see a dead deer carcass in the distance, if I can make it to there… maybe…maybe… I have a chance. Now, she is hovering so close I can feel the gust of her colossal wings. The acidic burn of her breath as she unfurls her serpentine tongue. And as she sinisterly narrows down toward me, she emits an ear-shattering screech somewhere between a howl and a mating call.
