Hey, it's Clara. I've just got to tell you about this bizarre journey I had with a new app called 'Memory Lane.'  
  
It's supposed to add color to old black and white photos. I was really excited to see my family's vintage pictures come to life, especially the ones of my great grandparents wandering the city in the 1920s. It felt like stepping right into a time portal, you know? Trying to imagine the incredible lives they led.  
  
But things took a weird turn super fast. This app started inserting strangers into my family photos. These unfamiliar faces were just mingling with my relatives, and at first, I thought it was some kind of software glitch. But these faces were eerily lifelike, showing up in every single photo I processed. When I reached out to the app's customer support, all they gave me was bland “try restarting” advice.  
  
Then things got really spooky. I started having these super vivid dreams about these unknown people. They were whispering things, but it was all muffled and unclear. It was downright creepy, like my brain was replaying my day but with a horror twist. Despite it all, I tried to just keep going with my daily life.  
  
But here’s where it gets truly wild – I was rushing home from work through downtown earlier today, and suddenly, I saw one of these faces from the photos!  
  
She was standing there by the old laundromat, staring straight at me. My heart practically stopped. I kept blinking, thinking I was hallucinating, but she was still there. I started wondering, am I going crazy? Was this some bizarre coincidence? Maybe the app was mixing up my family photos with those of this odd-looking lady?  
  
Curiosity got the better of me, and I started moving towards her. But as I got closer, I was literally rooted to the spot. This person looked so unnatural, almost otherworldly. She had an enormous head and a tiny body, with an unnaturally short torso and limbs. The best way I could describe her, or it, is as if she/it were an adult-sized baby dressed in ragged clothes, all covered in the shiny, slick substance of a newborn. She looked almost translucent, as if her bones were not fully solid yet.  
  
Frozen in place, debating whether to run or stay, she suddenly waved back at me with this really creepy smile. Then, in a weird, baby-like high-pitched voice, she said:  
  
"Hey there, sister. Enjoying your time with your cute little family as you grow up? I'm your unborn sister, lost to a miscarriage..."  
  
I was terrified beyond words. I somehow managed to get my heavy legs moving and half-ran, half-crawled back home as fast as I could.  
  
Once I was home, I started searching online frantically for any kind of explanation. What I found was chilling – tons of people using 'Memory Lane' were encountering deceased relatives or individuals claiming to be family from some alternate existence. Stories of ghostly relatives and phantom pets were all over the forums:  
  
"An old lady knocked on my door, and claimed she was my grandma’s older sister who died of cholera",  
  
"Help, my uncle who died in the war is just standing at my lawn, and his head is dripping blood",  
  
"What the hell, I saw the stray cat who I used to feed but ran over by a car a year ago just dragging her half body through my garden",  
  
Digesting these unsettling lines, it suddenly dawned on me – 'Memory Lane' wasn’t just reviving old photos. It was as if it was bringing back souls, the souls who might have still been in our lives, had things gone a bit differently in the past.  
  
I’m still trying to process all this, so I felt I needed to share this story with someone who might listen. Please, please don’t go looking for 'Memory Lane' in your app store. Cause some memories, it seems, should remain just that – memories, undisturbed and left alone.
