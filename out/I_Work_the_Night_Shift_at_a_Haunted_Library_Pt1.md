9/8/25



The public university I work for is on the decline. Staff positions are being cut, construction projects take years to complete due to shrinking budgets, and most of our technology is sorely outdated. As employee’s, it's our job to put on a brave face and serve the students as best we can, lest they catch on to the fact that their tuition might be better spent at another institution. Despite staff cuts, there are ten full time positions at the library, and I’m the only one willing to work the night shift. My coworkers all have children they need to go home to at a reasonable hour. I however, am domestically unattached and have managed to hold onto a teenage-like nocturnal sleep schedule well into my twenties. Staying up late and going to sleep in the wee hours of dawn is natural for me, and the weekend gives me enough time to socialize if I so chose.



The night shift is typically uneventful. Unless it’s around finals when a bunch of students are pulling all-nighters, I’ll usually have less than ten people in the large building at any given time, mostly freshmen dozing on couches, trying to avoid their ill-chosen roommates, and then the rare bibliophile or two. There are a few obligatory duties I have to perform like shelving, pulling resources for professors, and making sure the printers are stocked with paper. But other than that, I have a lot of free time to read or write or scroll social media. It’s an entry-level library position. Even though I finished my MLS this past Spring, I haven’t worked in the field long enough for anyone to take me seriously. So, I have to bide my time until I’ve earned at least a few gray hairs. It isn’t a bad gig though. As long as I finish my sparse amount of work, no one is really around to tell me what to do. 



Of course, I’m not completely alone. Campus police are on call in case anything alarming happens. When I first started, I was advised to call them anytime, even if I just felt a little uncomfortable. The library supervisor, an older maternal figure, was uncertain about hiring a woman for my position, especially one who still looked so young, because I would be in charge of securing the building. But before interviewing for this job, I worked as a behavioral technician in the homes of maladjusted children, and I assured her there was no situation that could scare me more than bedbugs, hoarder houses, and having to face the 300 pound mother I just called CPS on. The library didn’t strike me as a dangerous place anyway. Everything there was free to check out, so it’s not as if I would get held up at gun point.



I have had to call campus police a few times. Once when a group of girls reported a man staring at them while the blanket on his lap rapidly moved up and down. And another time when a student I suspected of being homeless became a little too infatuated with me. Each time, campo took nearly half an hour to show up, despite their building being right down the street. I still made sure to file reports so the incidents had a paper trail, but I've begun to doubt their effectiveness. The worst incident was when I discovered a nest of blankets and trash down in the boiler room, which I only visit about once a month to stock up on ink cartridges. The scene, with its balled up clothes and dark colored piss-bottles was extremely unsettling. But then it turned out it was just a student with a budding YouTube channel trying to do an overnight challenge thing. All the footage he collected was confiscated and he got expelled. He hasn’t tried to come back since, thank god.



During my first month of work at the library I was occasionally unnerved by the large empty building, but that was to be expected. I got used to the strange noises that accompany a structure built in the 1900’s, such as the massive bang that happens every night around 9pm when the old air cooling system shuts off. It sounds the same way thunder does when it’s right outside your house. But now I don’t even startle when it happens. There are still a few poorly lit corners of the stacks I don’t like to linger in, but I always knew my fear was unfounded.



That was until last night. I was doing rounds at 2:30AM, a half an hour before I closed. I always walk around and count how many people are in the building so that I can be sure they’ve all left by 3AM. I took note of two students on the main floor, and one on the ground floor by the old abandoned government documents office. We used to have a gov-docs librarian, but after he retired, the college removed that part of our budget and we were unable to re-fill the position. Now that area is filled with dusty, mildewing tomes that I’m not even sure exist in our digital catalog. I’ve wondered before why we don’t just toss them. If you’ve ever been inside a library and smelled something like stale B.O., there’s a good chance that’s not the patrons, but the smell of mildewing books. That smell shows up a little bit throughout various parts of this library, but is strongest in this corner. The student appeared to have nodded off, a hoodie covering his head, which was slumped down on the desk he sat at.



I didn’t bother to wake him since the announcements I make through the PA system usually do the trick. I walked back upstairs to the PA. “Attention please, the library will be closing in thirty minutes. For safety reasons, students are not allowed inside the building after 3AM. Thank you.” This was the spiel I gave every night. The script was typed out on a yellowing piece of paper taped down next to the microphone. I sat down at the circulation desk and noted as the two main-floor students shuffled out. It was 2:45AM and I went back to the PA. “Attention please, the library will be closing in fifteen minutes. If you have any items to check out or return, please do so now. Thank you.”



It got to be 2:55 and the student from downstairs still hadn’t left. I made my final announcement, dreading that I might have to walk back downstairs and shake him awake. “Attention please, the Library will be closed in five minutes. For safety reasons, students are not allowed inside the building after 3AM. Please begin moving towards the exit.”



I waited another minute and when he didn’t show, I went back down stairs feeling exasperated. When I reached the gov-docs corner, no one was there. The desk I’d previously seen him at was empty, although the chair was askew, as though he’d forgotten to push it back in. I rolled my eyes and did a sweep of the ground floor. It was empty. “*Oh god”,* I thought to myself, “*not another YouTuber.”* 



I went back upstairs, wondering if the student had left and I just missed it or if I was misremembering somehow. Despite my doubts, I decided to call campus police. If a kid decided to stay inside the library after closing and got hurt somehow, I was not willing to be liable. 



“Hello, Campus Police.” The on-shift officer answered.



“Hi, this is Mary over at the library. I think I might have a student hiding somewhere in the building after hours and I can’t find him. Could you send someone over to look around?”



“Absolutely, I’ll send someone over now.”



She hung up and I waited ten minutes for someone to arrive, which was actually a record pace for them. I sat at the desk while the guy walked around. It was nearly 3:30 by the time he returned, a little out of breath. “Welp, I couldn’t find anyone. Are you sure the kid didn’t leave while your back was turned?”



“You checked the boiler room?” I asked, past experience bubbling up.



“Yeah, I looked everywhere. The building is empty.” He assured me.



“Alright,” I sighed in relief. “He must’ve left when I was still finishing up my rounds. Sorry to waste your time, officer.”



“No worries, you get home safe now.” I locked up behind him, still feeling a little uneasy. I had done my due diligence though, so I turned out the lights, grabbed my bag, and made my way down to the loading dock doors by the parking lot. As I moved through the dark building, shadows seemed a little more menacing than usual. I heard a crash from the gov-docs corner. My head whipped around instinctively towards the noise, but it was too dark to see anything. I picked up my pace towards the technical services office where the exit was. I felt like something was right on my heels by the time I burst through the door to the parking lot. I ran to my car, haphazardly flung my work bag across my body into the passenger seat and locked the car doors behind me.



I pulled out my phone as I caught my breath. It was 3:34AM. Campus police would probably think I was insane if I called again to report the noise. But if I didn’t report it and the morning shift people showed up to a trashed building, I might be the one to blame.



“Hello, campus police.” The officer picked up again.



“Um, hi.” My palm was on my face as I tried to explain the situation in a way that didn’t make me sound like I was off my meds. “This is Mary again from the library. I’m out of the building in my car now, but as I was leaving I heard a loud crash on the bottom floor. I was thinking maybe you would want to take another look around.”



I’m pretty sure I heard the officer sigh on the other end of the line. “Look, ma’am, all our officers are out on other calls right now. I’ll have someone look into it as soon as possible. In the meantime, maybe you should go home and get some rest.”



Ugh, she called me ma’am. I’m too young to be respectfully referred to as ma’am which meant one thing: they think I’m crazy. That officer probably went back to the office and told everyone about the library lady who’s losing it. I was also pretty sure I heard other voices just outside the range of the phone, so I wondered if all the officers were really busy, or if she was just placating me. “Oh, o-okay. Thank you.” I hung up, feeling embarrassed but also frustrated. I drove home, wondering if I should’ve argued harder for them to take me seriously.



… 



When I got to work today, my manager pulled me aside. There’s a one hour overlap of the day shift and the night shift, that way we can catch up on work related updates. “I spoke to the chief of campus police this morning”, she began.



My eyes widened, the concern from last night rising back up. “Did they find someone? Was there any damage?!”



She paused, clearly put off by my sudden excitement, so I composed myself. “Well, no. He said they came back this morning at 5:30, and the building was empty. Nothing was out of place.”



My heart sank. “Oh”, I said, trying to seem calm, “it’s just I saw someone. And that noise was so loud, different from the air-cooler one…” Despite my conviction after the phone call with the rude officer last night, self-doubt crept back into my chest, along with a sense of dread. 



“It’s an old creaky building Mary, no one could blame you for getting spooked every once in a while. When we hired you though, you assured me you had nerves of steel. Have you been feeling alright? Is there anything wrong in your personal life?” She spoke sympathetically, but all I heard was a threat to my job. After all, she had wanted to hire a man for the position. Thanks to my paranoia last night, I let myself get caught acting like a girl.



My first reaction was indignation. But my brain quickly filtered through all the responses I wanted to make, finding that none of them would be congruent to keeping my job. I landed on resignation. If she wanted stability, that’s what she would get. I assured her everything was fine, and that I only called the police a second time out of concern for the university’s assets. That seemed to reassure her.



“One more thing”, she said as I was turning to leave. “What time did you leave the building last night after campus police came?”



“Um, a couple minutes after 3:30, I think.”



Her expression darkened, she seemed angry. When she collected herself she said, “I hope you know we are unable to pay you for any overtime.” I was taken aback, overtime had never crossed my mind and I assured her of that. “Well in the future, be sure to leave right after your shift ends at three. There’s no need to let work bleed over into your personal life.” I thanked her and left the office.



Now I’m sitting at the circulation desk. It’s another quiet night so I’ve had plenty of time to write everything out. I tried to explain everything here in as unbiased a way as possible. Am I being paranoid? I feel like I know what I saw and heard, but I’m also not so egotistical as to think I couldn’t make a mistake. The air cooling system just shut off with its loud boom, rattling the building in the process, so I’m about a third of the way through my shift. I’m worried about what might happen later, but I’m determined not to call the police again. I will write again tomorrow if there are any updates.
