Chattering about weekend plans filled the humid air around me. A boat trip down the local national park,  practice for a big football game,  a date with their big crush,  the list just kept on expanding. People leaning over their backrests and across the aisle in between the bus seats. All in all an almost comedically lighthearted atmosphere.  Well for everyone else. I sat there with my eyes glued to the window pretending to listen to my boyfriend getting all excited about the new game he was gonna play after getting home today. Just one more block and I would be able to see it. Not unlike an addict seeing their dealer sell them their next dose I gasped as the object of my obsession forced its way into my field of view. House number 04 on Halloway Row. 

A normal house every way you looked at it. With its two stories, an open window with flowers on the windowsill haloed by long orderly strands of ivy, a neatly kept lawn and a pathway so straight you might feel insecure. One couldn't be blamed if they felt suffocated by number 04's aggressive normalcy. That is except one very problematic detail. A perpetually open front door. Creeping up on me whenever I do not keep myself busy with other matters, stalking me through the landscapes of my fantasy. 

Regardless of whether I dream about my future with my love or the perils of my work life eventually I will round a corner, turn over a new page in a document, or open a drawer and find myself in front of the door. It beckons me like a siren with its song. Almost as if it was telling me that it stood open just for me, an invitation that I had no choice but to answer with my presence. "Honey are you all right? I gotta get off at the next stop. Don't lemme go without a kiss". Oh god, he has to get off already? Considering the distance between 04 and his stop I must have lost 20 minutes rambling to myself again. Feeling bad I gave him a long and intense kiss and told him to swing by mine tomorrow. The time between getting home and the approach of nightfall, when I would make my move, felt excruciatingly sluggish. As if the minutes had to wade through molasses to make their way around the clock. In the end, I managed to fill my time with preparations for my mission, and before I knew it I was standing at the beginning of the pathway without any bends.

My goal was finally in front of me with all that separated us being a step forward into the dimly lit hallway. I had spent a lot of time mulling over how I would feel when it finally happened, a part of me hoping that it would just turn out to be a silly boogeyman my mind had made up.I wished it was that way, that I could have just turned and walked away. 04 shattered every expectation I could have ever formed in my tiny obsessive brain. The vortex of temptation and terrified curiosity that had been keeping me fixated on coming here was replaced by a hypnotic sensation. At that very moment when I was confronted by this gateway into my very own abyss all my desires, wishes, and dreams about my future were hunted down and vored by the pressing need to enter. 

This was laughable, I must have been standing there for god knows how long. I finally gathered my courage and stepped forward. Immediately I was taken aback by a change in the air. No longer was I surrounded by the chilly summer night, no almost as if I walked into a cloud of perfume, the air became more dense and heavy. The hallway itself was about 12 feet long with a coathanger above a small table on the left and a mirror on the right. Turning toward the clothing I noticed quickly that not two of those pieces could belong to the same person. Sizes mixed and matched, completely different styles. The dust layers on them got thicker the closer you got to the wall. Underneath on, the small table was a bowl with an impressive assortment of keys.

Deciding that it was time to leave the floor behind me, the singular door was my only option. Slightly ajar and underlined by a halo of warm light. Cautiously, with my ear pressed against the door, I began pushing it open using the tips of my fingers. The living area that I entered sent every alarm bell in me into a red alert. My eyes first made their way to a large dinner table, completely decked out with plates and cutlery but the chairs faced away from the table and the plates were upside down. Next a sofa right behind the dining table. Facing toward a TV and a shelf.  The shelf however was not only empty but pushed halfway in front of the TV. Whatever lived here tried its absolute hardest to make it look like a human dwelled within these walls but didn't quite get it right. 

"Hello, dear visitor,  how nice of you to come by just when dinner is ready!". I spun around while falling backward at the same time. The floor knocked the wind clean out of me but that didn't matter at that moment.  All to get away from that voice without any form of intonation or rhythm to its speech. Just like the living area, every bit of that sentence was uttered with the intent of sounding human but it failed at the last step. Like a milkman falling on the porch in front of a home shattering the bottles seconds before they could be delivered. Oh so close to success, yet impossibly far away at the same time. 

With my back to the now-closed door, I raised my gaze at the perceived threat. A woman, small in her stature, doll-like in her appearance. Her skin was spotless, not a single crease or beauty spot dared disturb its perfection. Her smile was way too wide to be acceptable,  her dress neat and creaseless. Oh god and her eyes. Looking at, yet straight past me. Devoid of any shimmer. Dead like glass pearls. It probably noticed that its disguise did not do the trick so it walked over to the light switch and flipped it. 
Panicking and still out of breath I scrambled to my feet trying to regain control over my hands enough so that opening the door was not an impossible task anymore. Meanwhile, the dark room was filled with the sound of tearing skin. Soggy slapping echoed through the void, creating a gut-wrenching melody as whatever it was climbed out of its faulty disguise. Finally, the door gave way and I stumbled into the hallway,  just that it wasn't 12 feet long anymore.What was a dimly but still-lit short stretch before seemed like a dark void now. Out of other options, I booked it towards the spec of light that shimmered far off in the distance. Tremors caused by huge feet filled the space behind me as they kept gaining distance from me. Enclosed by the walls and darkness I no longer felt like I was in a house getting chased by a monster but more akin to a fool stuck in a train tunnel at the wrong time with inevitable death right behind me in the form of a cold steel giant. 

With a final desperate jump, I hit the gravel ground in front of the door. Only moving inches at a time I dragged myself away from 04's voracious maw. Not paying any attention to my nails breaking and splitting. My skin gave way to rough stones and dirt filled my mouth but my fear did not allow me to stop. Feeling like I was far enough away after what felt like an eternity of slithering on the ground I felt like a piece of raw meat. I needed to see how far I was away. Mustering my last bit of strength I risked a look over my shoulder and saw the house's closed door not even 3 feet behind me. The distance I covered was less than a foot. Hope took my last bit of energy with it when it left my body,  I passed out then and there.

This is being written on my boyfriend's laptop from the hospital's overnight ward. A neighbor called emergency services after seeing me lie there. Whatever you do, don't make my mistake. Resist the urge of an open door and ignore it.
