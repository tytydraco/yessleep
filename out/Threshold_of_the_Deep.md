There is no map for the waters beneath the cypress, for they run deeper than the earth itself. What moves there is not life as we know it, but something vaster, older, unbound by our hours and seasons. The swamp is only its skin.” -Dee Dee Star Burns

My name is Sophia Pembroke. I was fifteen in the summer of 1926, old enough to understand the tension in my parents’ voices when they thought we were asleep, but still young enough to believe the world’s darker corners could be explained by science or scripture. I was quite a silent girl, always in my mind. I would keep a journal, scribbling everything down as if writing might hold the world steady.

I had never thought of my family as adventurous. My father, Harold L. Pembroke was a bank clerk in Charleston, steady as the tick of a ledger clock; my mother, Gertrude, was a quiet woman whose world revolved around our church and her garden. Yet, in the summer of 1926, a strange notion seized my father’s imagination. He declared we would take our holiday “off the beaten track,” as he called it — deep into the wetlands of southern Louisiana.

He had been reading travel circulars for months, and one evening after supper he produced a glossy brochure printed with crude engravings of cypress trees, rustic cabins, and a smiling man hoisting an enormous catfish. “Unspoiled solitude,” he read aloud. “Nature at her most primeval. Fishing, birding, clean air. None of the vulgar amusements of the resorts.”

Mother’s lips tightened at the word “primeval.” She preferred Myrtle Beach, or failing that, Asheville’s mountain air. Yet Father had already paid a deposit. “It will be good for the children,” he said, meaning my brother Henry and me. “We are too cosseted by city life. We need to see something real.”

So it was that on an oppressive June morning we boarded the Seaboard Air Line Railway, our trunks labeled with tags promising “Pembroke — Bayou Retreat.” The train cars smelled of coal and hot varnish; the conductor, with his brass buttons and clipped accent, looked at us as if we had booked passage to another planet.

The ride south was a long descent into another world. At first we passed neat farms and stands of pine. Then the land flattened, the air grew heavier, and the vegetation thickened into tangles of green and brown. Cotton fields gave way to marsh. By the time we reached the station at LaFourche Parish, the heat struck us like a wet hand.

Waiting with a mule cart was a man named Baptiste, arranged by the proprietors of the cabin. He was small, wiry, his face like old leather. Around his neck hung a small pouch of something pungent. When my father tried to tip him in advance, he shook his head gravely. “Don’ give me money ‘fore you get there, sir. Bad luck.”
The track through the swamps narrowed to a footpath, and for the next hour we jolted along, hemmed in by cypress trunks thick as columns and hung with moss like gray, rotting lace. Insects droned a single endless note, and frogs croaked unseen. Even Henry, normally ebullient, fell silent.

At last the trees parted to reveal our lodging: a cabin raised on cedar pilings above black, motionless water. It looked sturdy but lonely, as if abandoned by the world. Around it, the swamp extended without horizon, only dark pools between trees, their surfaces stippled with floating green.

Baptiste set down our trunks and said only: “Stay near. Stay high. Don’t go out past the moss line after dark.” When my father tried to press him for more, he muttered something in French, made a sign with his fingers, and departed.

Inside, the cabin was plain but sound — wooden floors, iron bedsteads, a small iron stove. Yet I had the sense of intrusion, as if our presence had disturbed a stillness older than we could imagine.

That evening we walked into the small village half a mile away to buy bait and provisions. The villagers were a mixture of French and English stock, many with pale eyes and high, sharp cheekbones. They watched us with what might have been curiosity or mistrust. In the bait-and-tackle shop, an old man with a drooping mustache wrapped our hooks and lines in brown paper.

“Stay to the channels,” he warned when Father asked about fishing. “Don’t stray beyond where the water shines silver at dusk.” 
He leaned closer, lowering his voice. “There’s a family still out there — or somethin’ callin’ itself a family. Used to be people from town. Took to the water. Had children born wrong. Eyes big as moons. Skin slick as fish. They sing at night, soft and low. If you hear it once, you’ll not forget.”

Father laughed uneasily, but I saw Mother pale. Henry whispered, “Fish people?” and the old man shot him a look of such intense warning that it silenced us all. “Some say,” he muttered, “they don’t belong to us at all. Some say they belong to Dagon.”

Father’s knuckles whitened on the porch rail. “Dagon,” he repeated, the name sour in his mouth. “Tell me- who is Dagon?”

The old man’s eyes flickered towards the dark water, as if afraid it might overhear. “Ain’t rightly a ‘who,’” he rasped. “Older than the bayou, older than the sea. Folks round here say Dagon’s a name we borrowed for somethin’ vast ... .somethin’ that don’t much care for names. It gives dreams its own, and takes back what was always its.”

Father stared at the old man for a long moment, his jaw working as though he had more words but couldn’t find them. At last he gave a short, brittle laugh that didn’t reach his eyes. “Sea-gods and fish-folk,” he muttered, shaking his head. “We came down here for a bit of air, not to trade ghost stories. I thank you kindly for your….hospitality.” He tipped his hat, took mother by the arm, and steered Henry and me toward the dock, but his glance lingered on the black water longer than it should have, as if weighing the man’s words against the strange stillness of the swamp.

That night the cabin creaked and swayed above the water. Mosquitoes whined against the netting, and I dreamt of pale faces rising under the floor.

The next afternoon Father, with his characteristic optimism, insisted we explore the bayou by canoe. “The guidebook says the fireflies at dusk are like a fairyland,” he said. Mother demurred, but he prevailed. We paddled out just as the sun fell behind the cypress.

It was beautiful at first. The still water mirrored the fireflies until we seemed to float in a galaxy of gold. But as the light dimmed, a different sensation crept over me — not fear, but a pressure, as though the swamp were holding its breath.

Then came the sound.

It began as a low vibration felt more than heard, rising from the water beneath the canoe. My ribs trembled with it. Henry put his hands over his ears. It grew into a chord, deep and bubbling, like a choir singing underwater.

Shapes rose around us, chest-deep in the black water. Their eyes gleamed like coins in the lantern light, their arms long and oddly jointed, fingers webbed. One opened its mouth impossibly wide, and from it poured that humming note, joined by others until it became a chorus.

In that resonance I felt something stir beneath us — not life, but immensity, pressure, age. The water was a thin skin stretched over unfathomed gulfs.

Father paddled frantically. One of the creatures clambered onto a cypress root, limbs bending insect-like, its skin gleaming. For one instant its face turned to the moonlight, and I saw a visage half-human, half-slick spawn of the deep.

We reached the cabin by some Providence, but the humming followed. The porch boards creaked under wet feet, the screen door rattled, and from beneath the stilts the vibration rose again, shaking the timbers. Mother whispered prayers, Father sat white-faced with the rifle across his knees, and none of us slept.

At dawn, without a word, we packed and fled. Yet as the swamp receded, I felt its shadow cling. We had glimpsed a fragment of something vast, tied not merely to the swamp but to the sea, to ancient depths where Dagon waits, and beyond him, to that greater horror whose name even now I dare not speak.

We returned to Charleston in silence, as though the swamp’s humidity had seeped into our lungs and stiffened our tongues. The train clattered past pine barrens and rice fields, yet none of us spoke of what we had seen on the black water. Even Father — who had once treated fear as a character defect — seemed to shrink into himself, staring out at the passing scenery with a banker’s pallor and a sailor’s haunted eyes.

Mother tried to restore normality at once. She threw herself into the church ladies’ auxiliary, hosting teas, embroidering altar cloths, pressing hymns upon Henry and me as though sacred music might drown out the other hymn we had heard. Our brick house on East Bay Street smelled of starch and camphor, but behind it, in the garden pond, water striders skimmed and dragonflies hovered, and I saw Henry staring at them with unnerving fascination.

Henry was nine, and in those days still carried the roundness of childhood. Yet he began to change in small ways that Mother at first called “growing pains.” His appetite grew prodigious but strangely selective — he rejected bread and meat yet devoured fish with a near-animal hunger. He spent long afternoons at the edge of the tidal marsh watching the pluff mud bubble, whispering to himself. Sometimes I’d catch him with his trousers rolled up, wading knee-deep in the water, humming a low, throbbing note that set the egrets wheeling.

Father withdrew to his study, surrounding himself with the ledgers and blueprints of his bank work, but sometimes I’d hear him pacing at night, muttering “The swamp took him… the swamp took him” as though Henry were already lost. His once boisterous laugh disappeared entirely. The only time he touched the piano now was to plunk a single, droning bass note over and over, the exact interval that had quivered through our canoe in the bayou.

As for me, I turned to books. I haunted the second-hand stores along King Street, sifting through cracked volumes of folklore, travel memoirs, and the banned ethnographies of the occult section. In a tattered pamphlet on Louisiana folk beliefs, I found a hand-inked reference to “the marsh people of Y’ha-nthlei” and “Father Dagon of the Gulf.” A shipping gazette out of Newburyport mentioned a town called Innsmouth where “certain families are peculiar in their features and habits of bathing.” The names formed a secret constellation. Dagon. Deep Ones. R’lyeh. All whispered of something older than our species and broader than the ocean trenches.

Mother, alarmed by Henry’s pallor, consulted doctors. They found nothing amiss but prescribed cod liver oil. “It is good for the boy,” they said. Yet I saw him hiding the spoon, his lips slick, humming under his breath. His eyes, once brown, now had an odd glint in certain lights — a silvering, like fish scales. His jaw seemed subtly altered, the muscles pulling in ways that left a faint hollow beneath his ears. At night I would hear him moving about, and once I found the bathroom basin full of brackish water. He had been soaking in it.

In March of 1927, Charleston was lashed by a late winter storm. I woke to find Henry standing barefoot in the garden pond while thunder rolled over the Battery. He was up to his knees in water, arms limp, mouth open, emitting a low, bubbling vibration. The water rippled outward from him, not from the wind but from something beneath, and for an instant I saw a pale hand break the surface and sink again.

I ran for Mother. She dragged him out, trembling, soaked to the waist. He blinked at us as though he had been asleep, then laughed, a sound strangely doubled, like two voices at once. Father only stared and muttered a prayer in a language I did not recognize.

Henry’s notebooks, which I found later under his bed, were filled with sketches of architecture that no child could have invented — spiraling pylons, sunken temples, and angles that hurt the eyes. Names scrawled between the drawings: Y’ha-nthlei, Father Dagon, Cyclopean Throne. Some pages were wet and smelled of salt.

The neighbors began to whisper. Mrs. Armitage from next door crossed herself when she passed Henry. “He’s got the look,” she said to Mother. “Like those seamen from up North. Best keep him out of the water.” Mother burst into tears and slammed the door.

By summer, Mother’s health had collapsed. She took to her bed with a slow-burning fever that no doctor could name. She woke in the night clutching at invisible things, whispering “It’s coming up through the floor… it’s coming for him.” Father, who had once championed the swamp holiday, now roamed the house at night with a revolver, checking windows and drains. He had aged ten years in one.

And Henry — Henry had begun singing. Not a tune one could reproduce on any instrument, but a sequence of submerged vibrations that seemed to come from his chest and the walls at once. When he sang, water beaded on the windowpanes even on dry days. His sleepwalking grew worse. More than once I found him at dawn standing ankle-deep in the marsh behind our garden wall, eyes closed, head tilted as though listening to something far away.

It was then I knew: the swamp had not let him go. It had marked him. It was calling him.

I tried to stop him. I burned the sketches, tore up his notebooks, poured his brackish water down the drain. But at night the smell of tidal mud rose from beneath the floorboards, and I heard a faint splashing under the house. Even our dog would not go near the cellar.

Three years passed. Mother died in ’29, her last words a half-whispered plea to “keep Henry from the deep.” Father followed soon after, a hollow man with blank eyes, a victim of a stroke brought on by some unspoken terror. I alone remained, staring across the empty dinner table at Henry, who still hummed, who had grown taller and thinner, whose skin now had a slick sheen even after drying himself.

By then I had ceased to doubt. The swamp had a hold on him, on us. The hymn of the Deep Ones was seeping through the barriers of time and geography, carrying Henry back toward the water.

By 1934 I had learned to live with ghosts. The brick house on East Bay Street was empty now, its windows bricked with shadows. Mother’s death in ’29 had left a hush, and Father’s slow demise two years later completed the silence. Only Henry remained — and then one June morning he too vanished.

A fisherman upriver claimed he had seen him at dawn, barefoot, trousers rolled to the knee, walking toward the tidal marsh with his head tilted back as if listening to distant thunder. “He was humming,” the man said, “like a bullfrog, only deeper.” His footprints led to the waterline and stopped. Nobody was ever found.

I might have left it at that, telling myself Henry had drowned, but I knew better. The others had already gone before him — Aunt Lydia first, then poor Mr. Garrison who tried to intervene — and each loss hollowed me like a shell. Some nights I can still smell the marsh on their clothes, hear the wet gurgle of their breathing as they changed. His notebooks — those I hadn’t burned — still lurk in the attic, pages warped by salt and damp, filled with names I have learned to pronounce but never to comprehend. Y’ha-nthlei. Dagon. The Cyclopean Throne. I keep thinking that if I can burn them all, I can burn the memories, but they remain, like a watermark in my skull. I don’t know why it hasn’t taken me. Maybe I was never what it wanted. Maybe I was always meant to watch. I wonder if the thing in the water can see through my eyes, if every word I write only deepens its hold.

 Perhaps that’s why I still write — not to remember, but to try to drown it with ink before it drowns me with tide.
I spent the next months poring over old shipping manifests, ethnographies, and forbidden pamphlets from a Boston bookseller who dealt in “esoterica.” All the patterns converged on the same grim geography: Innsmouth in the north, Y’ha-nthlei beneath the Atlantic, and in the deep bayous of Louisiana, a backwater branch of the same lineage. I read of the “Covenant of the Black Gulf” — a hybrid cult whose members “kept to the swamps, away from rail lines and paved roads, and spoke a patois older than the French.” Every decade or so, children vanished from nearby parishes, their names scrubbed from records, as if history itself had grown ashamed.

By August of 1934, after sleepless nights and unnumbered cigars, I took a leave from my teaching position and boarded a train south. I carried only a satchel of clothes, a revolver, and Henry’s warped sketchbook.

The Louisiana I found was both changed and unchanged. New oil derricks rose from marshland, but the cypress still leaned over black water, their roots like arthritic claws. At LaFourche Station I hired a motorboat from a man named Dupre who recognized neither me nor my destination, and preferred not to. His boat sputtered through the channels under a blistering sun while mosquitoes pattered against my veil.

At last we reached the same landing where Baptiste had once left us. The cabin sagged on its stilts like a wounded animal, moss grown thick upon its roof. Windows gaped, broken; the porch boards were soft underfoot. Inside, our initials were still carved on the mantel, but the fireplace smelled of brine.

I left my bag on the cot and went out at dusk, lantern in hand. A hush had settled over the swamp — not silence, but expectancy. Even the frogs seemed muted. Fireflies glimmered in erratic constellations. Far off, something splashed.

I made for the village, such as it was. Half the houses stood empty, boarded or burned. The bait shop was still open, but manned now by a younger, gaunter man with silver eyes. He recognized me — or thought he did.

“You kin,” he said. “You got that look.”

“I’m looking for my brother,” I replied.

He glanced toward the water. “He come back. Took his place.”

“What place?”

But he only shrugged. “Best you leave ’fore dark.”
When I pressed money into his palm, he pushed it back and whispered, “They sing tonight.”

That night, the hymn rose.

At first it was distant, a tremor on the edge of hearing. Then it swelled until the cabin’s walls trembled. It was deeper now than the sound I had heard as a child — fuller, resonant, almost articulate. I went to the porch with my revolver and lantern. The water shimmered with phosphorescence, and out among the cypress a procession moved.

They came by the dozens, pale shapes chest-deep in the black water, torches of some greenish flame in their hands. Their faces were not masks but flesh — slick, finned, eyes gleaming like coins at the bottom of a well. And at their head was Henry.

He was taller than I remembered, his shoulders narrow and elongated, his limbs jointed strangely, his skin glistening like a seal’s. His hair was gone, his eyes lidless, his mouth wider than any human mouth, and when he opened it the hymn swelled like an organ chord. In his hands he bore a staff carved with spirals and runes I half-recognized from his sketchbook.
They halted before the cabin. Henry raised the staff. The water between us heaved and a voice — or rather a vibration — emanated from the depths, making my bones ache. I saw forms stirring below the surface, massive and slow, like the shadows of whales but wrong in proportion, jointed, finned, some with limbs that flexed like trees in a current.

Henry spoke then, not in English but in the bubbling tongue of his dreams. The congregation answered, swaying. The water parted slightly and I saw steps of stone descending into darkness, lit by faintly glowing growths. A smell rose up — salt and rot and an iron tang that made me gag.

“You do not belong here,” Henry said at last, in a voice doubled like an echo underwater. “This is the threshold. It calls only its own.”

“Henry, come back,” I shouted, but the words sounded pitiful, drowned by the hymn.

He tilted his head and smiled — a strange, slack-jawed smile, neither cruel nor kind, but pitying. “I am home,” he said simply. “You are the exile.”

Then the hymn surged to a crescendo, shaking the cypress. The congregation began to sink, one by one, slipping down the steps into the black beneath. Henry lingered a moment longer, hand outstretched as if inviting me. Behind him, the water bulged, and something immense rose just enough to break the surface — a ridge of scaled flesh, a glimpse of an eye like a drowned moon. Then he too descended, and the black closed over him.

The hymn cut off. Silence fell so absolute it roared in my ears.

I stayed frozen on the porch until dawn. The water was still, empty but for dragonflies and scum. No steps remained, no phosphorescence. Yet the boards beneath my feet were damp with salt water.

I left at first light. The villagers would not meet my eyes. As the boat carried me back to the rail station, I felt the hymn still thrumming faintly in my bones, like a distant drum. Henry was not gone; he had crossed a threshold. And the threshold remained.

Two years passed after I saw Henry descend the stair of stone. I tried to resume a life, but the swamp had grafted itself to my mind. It rose in dreams, in the humid corners of my boarding room, in the hiss of rain gutters at night. Students whispered that I had “taken to staring at nothing,” and my lectures on classical literature veered toward sunken civilizations and drowned cities no historian would name.

By 1936, I could no longer deny the summons. I had begun to dream not just of Henry but of the place itself: a stairway winding down through phosphorescent water; a gate of barnacled stone opening onto a cathedral of green-lit columns. My ears rang with a sound below hearing, like a tide throbbing under the earth’s crust.

Strange occurrences spread beyond my dreams. Newspapers carried small, easily overlooked notices: entire shoals of fish washed up belly-up along the Carolina coast; divers off New England reporting “columns of carved basalt” far below; sailors whispering of “a second Sargasso” south of Bermuda where the water bulged unnaturally. In every clipping, I saw Henry’s sketches, the same geometry, the same angles.

In February of that year, a parcel arrived without return address. Inside lay a shell — a massive spiral unlike any gastropod known to science, its surface etched with runes. Beneath it, on a slip of water-spotted paper, only two words in Henry’s hand: “It Opens.”

I resigned my post at the college and booked a passage to New Orleans under an assumed name. From there, following coordinates half-hidden in Henry’s old notebooks, I rode by freight to the bayou and hired a pirogue from a man who would not look me in the eye. As we poled into the channels, thunderheads rolled above, though no storm was forecast. The air smelled not of rot but of brine, as if the Gulf had crept miles inland.

At dusk, I reached the ruined cabin. Its timbers sagged; moss hung thick as curtains. Yet on the porch lay a fresh garland of some pallid weed, still dripping, arranged in a spiral — a sign that the place was watched. Inside, the walls pulsed faintly with dampness, and on the floor someone had painted a glyph I recognized from Henry’s notebook — a set of nested curves surrounding an open eye.

I did not sleep but drifted in a half-state. Around midnight the hymn began again, deeper and richer than before. Not a chorus now but a tide, a subterranean orchestra swelling and falling. The lantern glass trembled with it.

I stepped outside. The swamp glowed faintly, as though its water contained liquid stars. Between the cypress, shapes moved: villagers, yes, but no longer entirely human. They bore no torches this time. Their eyes themselves shone. Some crawled on all fours, limbs stretched to insect lengths; others moved upright but with a rolling gait like sea creatures under gravity.

Henry emerged at their head, taller still, his skin stippled with scales like coins set in wax. A crown of coiled shells rested on his brow, and his throat pulsed as he emitted the hymn. When he spoke, it was a bilingual utterance — a human voice overlaid with the abyssal resonance of the deep.

“It rises,” he said. “The threshold is thin. Come see.”

They led me — not by force but by a gravity I could not resist — through knee-deep water to the stair I had seen before. This time no illusion: carved basalt steps, broad and ancient, descending into blackness lit by a slow pulse of green light. Barnacles clung to the risers. I smelled kelp, rust, and something sweeter, almost intoxicating.

Below, a cavern opened: a vast amphitheater of stone with columns spiraling up to a surface of water that was no longer the swamp’s. Shapes the size of cathedral spires loomed in that water, stirring slowly. Murals carved into the walls showed the same forms, drawn with reverence and terror: creatures with limbs and fins, faces only half-suggested, rising from a vortex.

Henry raised his arms, and the congregation formed a circle. The hymn became words, or something like words, a litany of syllables so ancient they bent the air. The water below shivered and parted, revealing a chasm filled with lightless depth. From it came a smell like tides over stone that has never seen the sun.

I saw now what their summoning sought: not Dagon himself, who was but an intermediary, but a flicker of something more terrible. Between pulses of green light, an eye opened below the chasm — not like any earthly eye, but a vertical slit of phosphorescence vast as a tower window. It opened, focused, and shut. When it did, my knees gave way.

Henry gestured to me. “It dreams, but it turns,” he said. “It stirs because the stars are right. We have sung it awake in its sleep, but soon it will wake.”

I felt words rising in my own throat, syllables I had never learned but now remembered, like a language from a forgotten ancestry. My hands twitched toward the gesture the others made. Some part of me longed to step forward, down into the chasm, to lose the fragile line of the self and become part of the vastness.
I wrenched my eyes away and fled back up the steps, stumbling through the congregation. None stopped me. Perhaps they knew my fate was sealed regardless. Behind me, the hymn climbed toward a climax so vast it seemed the trees above must topple. Lightning flickered, but no thunder followed.

I burst onto the porch of the cabin, fell to my knees, and covered my ears, yet the hymn vibrated through the wood, through the water, through my bones. I had seen the prelude. The rest would come.

At dawn, the swamp lay still. No steps remained. No congregation, no Henry. Only the cabin sagged behind me, and a single shell lay on the threshold, etched with the rune for “Return.”

I left Louisiana again, but this time I did not tell myself it was over. The thing below the swamp was awake now. Henry’s words tolled in my mind like a buoy bell: It stirs because the stars are right.

I have not been whole since the night I fled the stair of stone. The years since 1936 have been a limbo of sleeplessness and damp dreams. I teach no more, write no more. My evenings are spent hunched over a shortwave receiver, scanning the dial for a note I cannot name. At times I think I hear it — a vibration below the hum of static, a thrumming tide — and my palms sweat with recognition.

The world itself seems to tremble on the cusp of revelation. Newspapers carry small, inexplicable accounts: fishermen netting creatures “not of any known species” off the Carolinas; Caribbean divers glimpsing “impossible ruins” far below safe depth; gauges on scientific expeditions recording “deep-sea pressure anomalies” rising and falling as though something were breathing under the crust.

I cannot say when the boundary between waking and dream collapsed entirely. Perhaps it began with the letter. It arrived in April of 1938, no stamp, no address, only a barnacled envelope. Inside: a single photograph — Henry, bare to the waist, standing ankle-deep in water beneath a vaulted stone ceiling, arms raised as phosphorescent forms spiraled around him. Across the back, in his hand: “Soon.”

Since then, sleep brings no respite. I am again in the stair, descending. I see a gate of basalt, a cathedral whose pillars spiral like seashells, and at the center a chasm where light dies. I wake with brine in my mouth, footprints of wet silt across my floorboards, and shells on the windowsill that no earthly tide could have placed.
By July the radio no longer matters; the hymn has moved into the city. Storm drains gurgle with it. The harbor water rises an inch each week though no moon explains it. Gulls wheel inland and die on rooftops. Even the newspapers cannot ignore the tides of fish washing up in grotesque formations, as if spelling words.

I knew then that I would not be spared. The threshold was not merely in Louisiana; it was everywhere now, a global upwelling of something vast and half-waking. And Henry — Henry was its herald.

On the 23rd of July I boarded a southbound train again, not as a man fleeing but as a man called. My dreams had shown me the hour. The stars in my almanac matched the symbols in Henry’s notebooks. I arrived at the bayou under a sky like green glass. Even the air had changed: thicker, tasting of iron and salt.

The swamp awaited me. Not just water now but a moving mass, tidal pools swelling as though a hidden lung exhaled below. The cypress leaned at new angles, their roots gnarled into spirals. Between them, phosphorescence pulsed like a heartbeat.

I reached the site of the cabin. Nothing remained but pilings, barnacled and wet, yet a path of shells curved outward into the swamp. Without thinking, I followed it.
Ahead, a congregation had gathered, larger than any before — villagers, strangers, figures in slick cloaks, and beings that were no longer pretending to be human. In the center stood Henry, crowned with a headdress of coiled shells, his arms outspread. Around him the water rose in a slow, circular swell.

He turned to me, and his voice carried over the hymn — still doubled, but now immense, a tone that made the cypress shudder. “It wakes,” he said. “Come witness what was promised.”

The congregation parted. Before us, the water opened, revealing a descending avenue of stone. This was no stair but a boulevard, broad enough for armies. Its walls glistened with murals showing epochs before man, oceans without continents, and at the end of every scene the same shape rising — a shadow whose outline hurt the eyes, limbs and wings and coils too many to count.

I stepped down. The air grew thicker, cooler, yet electric with pressure. Below opened the cathedral from my dreams, columns spiraling up into darkness. The chasm at its center boiled with phosphorescence. The hymn reached its zenith.

Then the chasm split.
A mass rose — not the whole, but a mere tendril of it — vast as a tower, plated in barnacle and scale, dripping luminous water. An eye opened, vertical and lidless, glowing green-white. It saw us.

All sound stopped for an instant. In that pause I understood — not with language but with something older — that this was not Dagon, nor any intermediary, but one of the true powers, a dreaming mind turning in its sleep. The bayou had been its eyelid; Henry and the cult, its dreamers. And now it was looking back.
I felt my selfhood disintegrate. Memories fell away like flakes of old paint. The eye did not hate or love; it recognized. In its gaze was the pull of the deep, the inexorable reclamation of all things that crawl upon land.

I do not remember how I escaped. One heartbeat I was standing before the opened eye, its pupil as wide as the horizon and darker than any night sky I had known; the next I was collapsed on wet grass miles inland, my knees sunk into mud that smelled of old iron and rotting blossoms. The hymn was gone, or not gone but so faint it might have been memory, a thread vibrating somewhere in the marrow of my bones. My clothes reeked of brine and something older, a mineral sweetness that reminded me of blood and lightning storms. My hair had dried stiff with salt, and when I touched it my fingertips came away white. In my palm lay a shell I did not remember taking — a spiraled thing the size of my hand, etched with lines that moved like writing when I blinked, shifting from one shape to another like a dream trying to be recalled. It pulsed faintly, warm one moment, ice-cold the next, as if keeping time with a heartbeat under the soil. I could still taste the swamp’s metallic water at the back of my throat, a flavor like rust, tide pools, and electricity. I tried to spit it out but it clung to my tongue, sour and sweet at once.

Since that night the harbor has behaved like no harbor should. The water rises without moon or storm; ships moored at the docks drift higher each dawn as though some invisible flood tide is lifting them from below. Fish leap from drains, silver arcs over cobblestones, flopping across brick streets as if desperate to escape a current no one else can see. Wells bubble with brackish foam. Entire streets sweat a thin sheen of salt that crystallizes overnight into lace-like frostwork. When I brush it away it clings to my skin like spores and leaves a sting behind. At night the hymn comes up through my floorboards, swelling, retreating, swelling again, like a tide pressing its forehead against my walls. Sometimes it carries a human voice, echoing phrases from my own childhood lullabies; other times it is not a voice at all but a vibration that travels through the bones of the house, through my ribs, through the ink in my pen, making every word I write tremble. I write because I cannot sleep; I write because the sound demands a shape.

My hands ache with cold even in summer. My dreams have become cities inverted beneath the tide, their windows bright with unhuman stars. Bridges of coral span impossible distances between towers of bone-white stone. Creatures — or citizens — drift through these submerged streets, their gestures patient, ritualized, neither swimming nor walking but sliding along unseen currents. In some dreams I am one of them, wearing the pressure of the deep like a second skin, moving without breath or heartbeat. I tell myself I was spared, but when I wake at three in the morning the marsh is on my skin, cool and endless, and the ceiling above my bed ripples like a surface about to break. The faintest draft smells of brine. Every nailhead in the floorboards is crusted with salt. I think: I was sent back, returned as a herald or an anchor, left behind to write the threshold into being on dry land.

Daylight no longer reassures me. Reflections bend the wrong way in mirrors; glass warps like water when I approach it. My shadow carries salt water, dripping even in crowds. In the hush of libraries, in train stations, I hear the hymn stitched between footsteps, an undertone in the noise of engines. Once, a child hummed the same phrase as she passed me and her eyes turned the color of sea-glass for a heartbeat. I am becoming porous, a vessel. Perhaps I always was. Perhaps that is why I survived — not because I was spared, but because I was chosen. The thought chills me more than death.

I can feel changes in my body now. There is a tightness along my ribs as if something presses from within, expanding with each breath. My veins feel cool, my skin too thin. I am attuned to the pull of tides even hundreds of miles from the coast; I sense moon phases in the ache of my teeth. My breathing slows at night until it matches the rise and fall of some far-off current. My dreams grow longer, more vivid, more physical.

 Sometimes I wake with damp hair or grit under my fingernails, though I have not left my room. Sometimes, standing at a window, I smell barnacles and cold iron and know the water is on its way.

The swamp was never a place but a hinge between worlds, and hinges do not stay shut forever. Every sunset feels thinner, the sky stitched with seams of green light like veins under translucent skin. The streetlights flicker in tidal patterns, off and on, off and on, as if mimicking some unseen chart. The insects of summer no longer sing but click in pulses, like clocks wound by a foreign hand. My neighbors complain of dreams they cannot describe. There are fewer birds each morning. Dogs refuse to cross puddles. Cats stare at drains and hiss at the echo of water. Each dawn, more shells appear on my porch, wet and faintly warm, arranged in patterns that change if I look away.

The changes have reached me too. Sometimes my reflection lags behind, mouth moving in words I have not spoken. Sometimes my skin smells of ozone and copper. The hunger in me grows stranger: I crave saltwater, raw shellfish, the tang of brine. My lungs ache when I breathe air too long. It no longer feels like breathing; it feels like waiting.

One night soon the hymn will crest again, louder than tides, deeper than thunder, and I will not wake on land. Perhaps none of us will. Perhaps the land itself will wake and walk back into the sea, and the hymn will no longer need to call — it will simply be, a depth without bottom, a sky without stars, a threshold with no other side. When I close my eyes, I see that endless green-black vista beneath the cypress roots. I feel its pressure on my bones. It waits for me. It waits for everyone.

Already my handwriting ripples like ink on a tide. Perhaps this is no warning but a baptism, and the hymn that began as a whisper in the marsh has at last become the only song there is, a note that will outlast sky, stone, and soul alike. My heart beats slower and slower as I write this. The walls pulse with the tide. My breath leaves in bubbles. The surface above me trembles. My tongue tastes of salt and iron. My eyes sting. My skin feels thinner. And still, impossibly, I write — one word, another, each dissolving into salt, each carried away by the deep.
