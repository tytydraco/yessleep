[This Isn't My Dog (Part 1) : r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o0sgfe/this_isnt_my_dog_part_1/) 

“Momma!” the high-pitched voice called from downstairs.  “I’m home!” the pitter-patters of his tiny feet rang through the house.  The squeaks of the stairs followed soon after.  I got up from my chair and headed into the hallway.

“Hi, Lu!” I exclaimed with open arms.  “Come here, buddy.”  I squatted down as he ran to me with a bright and big smile.  I gave him a big embrace and lifted him up a bit, Lucius squealing with excitement.  Mahesh came up the stairs soon after.

“Hey, honey,” he called, walking to the both of us.  He walked a bit slowly and had slight bags under his eyes.  His hair was a bit messy, and the sleeves that were once neatly rolled up were now shoved on his elbows, one movement away from falling down.

I placed Lucius back on the ground and told him, “Why don’t you put your backpack in your room and take out your homework, Lu?”  “Okay!” he exclaimed, jumping up and down  “Can I play with Lucy after?”  I hesitated, the choice lingering heavily in the air.  “We’ll see baby.”  “Yay!”  He then sprinted down the hall and into his room.

Mahesh laughed, “I thought he was going to smack into his doorframe.”  He ran his fingers through his hair and walked closer to me.  “Rough day?” I asked, moving some loose strands away from his eyes.  

He held my waist and responded, “Yeah, we got a new shipment of merchandise so that’s practically what I did all day.  That and about seven customers that were just never happy.”  He breathed a heavy sigh with a slight smile, “This is not what I imagined would happen when I got a higher position at work.”  “No one ever said managerial work would be easy,” I replied before kissing his nose.

“Yeah,” he responded tiredly.  “Just glad to be finally home.”  I patted his chest, “Well then, you can take a shower and get settled while I get dinner ready.”  He backed away slightly to crack his neck.  “Okay then,” he said, the pops loudly resonating from his bones.  “What’s on the menu?”

“I was thinking about green chile stew,” I replied, folding my arms along my chest.  “We have some chile that’s been in the freezer for a while.”  “Sounds great, honey,” he responded with a slight smile.  “I’m going to change my clothes now.”  He yawned and walked down to the room opposite Lucius'.

While left alone in my room, I sucked my teeth awkwardly.  The situation with Lucy was just going to be another thing he had to deal with.  There’s no way I was just going to leave it, so I decided to let him relax for a short while.

The kitchen became warm, the heat from the pot and stove warmed up the room.  The scent of hot chile filled the house and made my nose run.  I blew my nose into a paper towel as I heard footsteps coming down the stairs.

“Something smells good in here,” Mahesh remarked, much more chipper than when he came home.  “I can’t tell you how hungry I am.”  He walked over to the pot and stuck a finger in.  “It tastes good,” he told me, placing the soup covered finger in his mouth.  “It is a bit hot though.”  I grabbed a towel off the counter and hit him with it, laughing, “Maybe it’s because you stuck your finger in a pot of boiling soup.”  He responded with a small slap to my rear.

“Momma!” Lucius exclaimed, running into the kitchen with a piece of paper.  “I finished my homework and made my bed!”  “Good job, baby,” I told him, placing a mixing spoon into the pot.  “I’m almost done with dinner so get ready to eat, okay?”  “Okay!” he called, turning the corner and running back upstairs.

Mahesh shook his head in amusement.  “I wish I had energy like that,” he said, leaning on the counter.  I turned to face him, “Youth really is wasted on the young.”  He replied with a slight chuckle.

“How was your day, Ellice?” he asked.  I paused before replying, “It was…good.”  “How was Lucy?”  I stayed quiet and took a deep breath.

“Weird,” I said.  “I had to leave her outside most of the day.”  “What do you mean?” he questioned, his stance becoming less relaxed.  I stopped stirring the pot before explaining, “She kept just sitting there and watching my every move.  She’s not at all energetic, but I don’t know if it’s just because she was gone for so long.  It creeped me out, Mahesh.  So much so that I had to leave her outside with some water.  Even then, she was watching me from the window in my office.”

“Damn,” he replied, blinking a few times.  “That is weird.  Especially because Lucy hates being outside by herself.”  “And she almost bit me,” I interrupted, the thought coming back.  Mahesh looked at me in shock.  “What do you mean?” he asked, gently grasping my body and searching for any marking on my body.  “Are you alright?”

“Well,” I began, trying to remember the details clearly.  “I don’t know if she was just hungry and lunged at the food, but she was just so close to my hand.  It might’ve just been from nerves that I freaked out so much, but she was just so calm beforehand.”

“Did she just do it that one time?” he interrogated, now holding my shoulders.  “Yeah, she didn’t get that close to me afterwards.”  I looked toward the doorway leading out of the kitchen.  “I’m worried about letting Lucius play with her, but I think we’ll be alright if I’m constantly watching them.”

“She did act normal when she came home and played with him last night,” Mahesh added, staring at the floor in thought.  “I’ll help you keep a close eye.”  “Did she try to bite you when you fed her last night?” I asked.  “Nope.  She just ate the food normally.”

I breathed a sigh and continued to stir the soup.  “Maybe she just doesn’t like you,” he said in an attempt to break the tension.  I gave him a look of annoyance.  “Sorry…” he apologized, going back to his previous leaning place on the counter.

“Also,” I began, turning off the stove.  “Please tell me when you let her out of the cage.  She scared me half to death.”  “What do you mean?” he asked, his eyebrows furrowing.  “As soon as I stepped outside,” I continued.  “She was already out of her cage and standing near the door.”

Mahesh looked at the ground in thought.  “I don’t remember letting her out.  I don’t even think I went outside this morning before I left.”  My eyes widened in horror.  “Mahesh, what are you talking about?” I questioned, moving closer to him.  “Are you saying she just got out on her own?”

“No, no, no,” he responded, holding me by my arms.  “I probably just didn’t close the cage correctly.  It has been a while since she’s been here.”  I stared at his chest and calmed myself down.  “I guess so,”  I replied, almost embarrassed.  “I’m sorry honey, it’s just with all the things from today.”  “Don’t worry, Ellice.”

He kissed my forehead and said, “I’m hungry, let’s eat.”  Moving his head to my level, he looked into my eyes.  “It’ll be alright baby.  I’ll feed her tonight and make sure that I close the cage right.”  I nodded.

“Lucius!” I called.  “Time for dinner!”  Small pitter-patters could be heard through the ceiling.  “Coming!” he exclaimed, his voice wavering as if he were driving on a bumpy road.  I laughed, praying he didn’t fall down the stairs as he sped to the kitchen.

Mahesh lightly grabbed my arm and gave me a sweet smile.  He then ran to Lucius and picked him up, spinning him around.  I took a deep breath, composing myself for my son.

He ran up to me, his little legs taking him as fast as they could.  “Food!” he cried, jumping in place.  “Food!  Food!”  “Calm down,” I told him with a smile.  “You’re going to hurt yourself.”  “She’s right,” Mahesh added, picking up the squealing boy.  “Let’s let momma serve the food.”

“Do you want a big or a small portion, you two?” I called, ladle in hand.  “Big!” Lucius called from over his father’s shoulder.  “Me too!” Mahesh said, spinning around with him.  I chuckled and shook my head, serving soup into a bowl.

Mahesh then took Lucius to the living room while I set the table.  I smiled slightly, as it was always so nice to be together and eat.  My eyes traveled past the table and toward the door of the backyard.  I could only see the top of the dog bowl from the threshold of the door, but it reminded me that we still had to let Lucy inside to eat.

“Is it time to eat?” Mahesh asked, breaking me out of my trance.  “O-oh,” I began, glancing at the dinner setup.  “It is.  Let’s sit down.”  “What about Lucy?” Lucius asked, hopping off of the couch.  “Can she eat with us?”  “O-of course, Lu,” I stuttered, folding my arms along my chest.

“Let’s go make her favorite, buddy,” Mahesh said to him, motioning toward the kitchen.  “Yay!” he exclaimed, running to the cabinets.  We kept the salt and canned tuna near the bottom so he could make it for her by himself.  It just became a habit, so we never moved it after Lucy went missing.

Mahesh stepped outside to grab the dog bowl.  He looked around to check for Lucy, but it didn’t look like he saw her.  He picked it up, miscalculating the weight and spilled some water on the floor.  He turned to me, confused.  “Did you refill the water bowl?” he asked, water dripping down his arm.  I shook my head, also staring at the almost full water bowl.

“Dada!” Lucius exclaimed, holding the can of tuna.  “Let’s fill the bowl now!”  “Alright buddy.” he replied, stepping slightly outside.  He dumped the bug filled water into the grass outside and cleaned it in the sink.

The two of them put together the salty concoction as I waited nervously at the table.  I looked over to face the yard, hoping I wouldn’t see the dog’s beady eyes, seemingly staring into my soul.  I released a breath I didn’t know I was holding when she wasn’t there.

“Finished!” my son cried, making me flinch.  He held the bowl in his hands, it looked massive compared to his small body.  He placed it next to the table, the normal spot where she always had eaten.  “Momma!” he called, jumping.  “Let Lucy in now!”

“I got it, buddy,” Mahesh replied, ruffling his hair.  He headed toward the door as a lump formed in my throat.  I felt so stupid for worrying.  “*It’s just a creepy dog,*” I thought, unclenching my jaw.  That singular thought brought me back to reality.  “*What am I even thinking?  It’s a creepy dog.  That’s exactly why I’m worried.*”

As soon as the door opened, Lucy bolted in and began jumping on Mahesh’s leg.  He chucked a bit, glancing up at me in confusion.  I swallowed, calming my nerves.

Lucius then ran toward her and I panicked.  I reached out to grab and pull him away, but realizing at the last minute, I yanked my arm back.  I folded them along my chest and cleared my throat.  Lucy turned her attention toward Lucius, licking his face over and over.  I couldn’t ignore my gut any longer and pulled him away a little harder than I should’ve.

“What’s wrong, momma?” he asked, looking up at me in confusion and worry.  “N-nothing,” I stuttered, gently pulling him away.  “We just need to eat now.”  I led him away with a hand on his back.

“I want Lucy to eat by me!” Lucius asked as he hopped into his seat.  “Let’s have her sit next to me, buddy,” Mahesh said, flashing him a smile.  “I miss her too.”  Lucius pouted a bit but was quickly distracted by the soup in front of him.

We all started eating without any problems.  Lucius and Mahesh complimented the food, bringing a smile to my face and easing my nerves.  It took a while until I looked to the side of Mahesh.  Lucy sat on the ground, staring at the tuna in her bowl.  She tilted her head, seemingly searching for something.  I shuddered, Lucy always attacks her bowl whenever we give her salty tuna.  We would barely start eating by the time she was whining at us for more of her favorite concoction.

Mahesh noticed my gaze and followed my eyes.  He gave me a look of confusion, wondering the same questions as me.  He stayed silent before suggesting, “Maybe she just doesn’t want it.  She has been gone for a year.”

I sighed worryingly, looking back down at my food.  Her strange behavior had changed now that there were more people in the house, but does a dog really forget their prior favorite food?  Wouldn’t they sniff it at least?

Mahesh stood up, the chair scraping along the floor.  “I’ll see what we have in the fridge,” he began, petting Lucy on the head as he passed.  “I didn’t have time to get dog food today, so I’ll get some tomorrow.”

“What’s wrong, Dada?” Lucius asked, stew dripping down his chin.  “Lucy doesn’t want salty tuna today, buddy,” he replied.  He took the bowl, setting the tuna aside in a separate container.  He came back with some leftover pulled pork and she ate it with no problem.

Dinner went well after that without any complaints or issues.  I kept glancing over at Lucy every few minutes to make sure she wasn’t doing anything weird.  Whenever he noticed, Mahesh would tap the side of my leg with his foot, bringing me back to the present moment.  Lucy ate her food without a hitch and like a normal dog, a clear display of her personality change from her behavior earlier in the day.

I washed the pans and dinner bowls as Mahesh took Lucius and Lucy to the living room.  I don’t recall ever having washed dishes so fast in my life.  The sounds from the room next to me were normal, just a father and son playing with a dog.  However, to my still suspicious mind, I was wary of every odd sound.

I lazily dried my hands, water dripping from the tips of my fingers as I made my way to the three of them.  Just as the sounds told me, nothing odd or worrying was happening.  Mahesh was lifting Lucius as Lucy jumped on his legs in an attempt to get the boy.  They all wore smiles, but my gut churned in my body as I hastily wiped the access water on my pants.

“Let’s sit down now,” I said, reaching for Lucius.  “We just ate and it’s not good to run around so much so soon.”  He laughed as he was passed into my arms.  I set him down in front of me and he hugged my legs before running back to Lucy.

“I missed seeing him this happy,” Mahesh began as we sat down on the couch in front of the two.  “The fire in his eyes is back.”  I chuckled, bringing my eyes to watch the pair.  “Yeah, it is.”  My smile slowly faded as I drew in a sigh.

Mahesh brought his hand to my face, moving a piece of hair away.  “It’ll be alright,” he began, his voice soft and gentle.  “I meant to tell you earlier, but I called the vet and they can look at Lucy the day after tomorrow.”

I quickly turned my head, saying, “Actually?”  He nodded with a small smile and I breathed a sigh of relief.  “I thought it would at least take a week.”  “I did too, but Dr. Lawrence moved some things around and was able to squeeze us in first thing in the morning.”

“That’s a relief,” I remarked, bringing my attention back to Lucius and Lucy.  “Her change of behavior is just eating away at me.”  “I understand,” Mahesh began, laying his arm on the couch around me.  “But relax a bit.  It’s not like we’re in a horror movie and Lucy acts just fine when all of us are here.”

I turned to face him, feeling my face scrunch in annoyance.  “You’re joking, Mahesh.”  “H-hold on,” he continued, holding a palm out in front of him.  “I’m just saying that maybe Lucy feels most comfortable around Lucius.  She was closest with him prior to getting lost, so it’s possible she doesn’t trust us right now.”

“You mean she doesn’t trust *me* right now,” I added sternly, calming my facial expression.  I turned back to the questionable animal.  “Well…” Mahesh started, eyes fixated on the ground.  “I don’t know, honey.  We’ll get everything figured out soon enough.”  I sat back, letting my posture slouch.

Lucius pet Lucy’s head and she responded by licking his hand.  I sprung forward in my seat, ready to pry her jaw off of my son’s arm.  However, it was not needed.  He simply giggled as she pulled her snout back, panting.  Before she could fully close her mouth, Lucius looked at her with worried confusion.  His head shot up to look at me.  “Momma!”  Without hesitation, I lunged forward, holding him by his arms.

“What’s wrong?” I asked, inspecting the hand that was licked, the shine of spit still on it.  “Is everything okay?”  “Lucy’s missing a tooth!” he exclaimed, pointing to her mouth.  I let go of him and kneeled in between the two.  I brought my hands up to open her jaw, just as I had done many times before.  Instead, I stopped midway through, the memory of when I fed her earlier rearing its ugly head.  I looked at Lucy, seemingly asking what to do.  She stared at me coldly, my hands launching back to my chest in response.

Mahesh joined me on the ground, doing the job my instincts were afraid to do.  “Oh, what?” he stated, peering into her mouth, his fingers grasping her dull teeth.  Lucius wasn’t wrong, Lucy’s right canine tooth was snapped off.

“Was she missing a tooth when she came back?” Mahesh asked, looking at me in a confused shock.  “No,” Lucius replied, stepping closer.  “She had all her tooths.”  “Did she lose it outside?”  “I-I…” I stuttered, blinking as if it would help me remember.  “I’m not sure.”

Suddenly, a horrible memory flashing into my mind, sending a shiver up my spine.  “Mahesh,” I began, standing up as steadily as I could.  “Watch Lucius.”  Before he could ask any questions, I quickly made my way to the stairs.  “*There’s no way*, I thought, walking toward my office.  “*There’s just no way.*”

I returned to the living room shortly after, hand encasing a small object.  “I thought it was a piece of drywall from the ceiling,” I told Mahesh, handing out the strange white structure.  “I found it after she almost bit-”  I stopped myself, glancing over at my son, his small eyes filled with worry.  “...when I fed her this morning.” I continued.

He took the object and inspected it, turning it around in his hand.  “Well, I’ll be damned," he started, moving it toward Lucy’s open jaw.  “It’s her tooth.”  He lightly placed it under the small gap in her mouth.  It was a perfect fit.

Mahesh sighed with a chuckle, “She must’ve snapped a cracked tooth.  I’ve never seen this happen, even when I was a kid.”  I placed a gentle but firm hand on Lucius’ small shoulder.  “Why do you think it was cracked?”

He stood up, taking the tooth with him.  “There’s no way a dog can break its canine from biting down that hard, especially at her age.  It had to have been cracked.”

“Is Lucy going to be okay?” Lucius asked, shuffling slightly towards his dad.  He reached down and patted his head.  “She’s going to be just fine,” he assured.  “She still has the rest of her teeth so she’ll be okay, bud.”

Lucius looked up at him, excitement returning to his expression.  “Does that mean we can keep playing?” he asked, bouncing up and down.  “Yep,” Mahesh replied with a grin.  “It sure does, buddy.”

“Honey,” I called, staring daggers at him.  He looked and gave me a confused shrug.  I motioned toward Lucy with my eyes and back to him, disgust and fear on my face.  “I’ll sit on the floor with them,” he mumbled, his calm demeanor relaxing my tense expression.

I breathed out a quick breath and walked to the couch.  Mahesh sat to my side on the rug, leaning back on his hands that propped him up from the floor.  “Alright,” he began under his breath, turning his head to face me.  “You have to understand why I downplayed it, right?”

“Because I’m already freaking out?” I asked, arms locked across my chest, a pit of guilt building in my stomach.  “That and not to scare Lu,” he replied, gazing at him.  “He’s a smart boy so I don’t doubt he’s already noticed your unease.  There’s no need to make him more worried.”

I looked at my son, the bubbly boy enjoying time with his puppy.  A slight smile appeared on my face, the sight reminiscent of when she became the new addition to our family.  “I know you’re worried, honey,” Mahesh continued, looking back at me.  “I am too.  We just have to hold out for one more day.”

“Easy for you to say when you’re not home with her all day.” I said, a bit more harshly than I meant.  “Ellice,” he started.  “She scares me, Mahesh.  She sits and watches me all day.  I don’t know about you, but that’s terrifying.”

“Ellice,” he repeated, leaning his head on the couch cushion.  “I see how much it worries you and that’s why I got the appointment as soon as I could.”  Feeling the pit of guilt grow, I brought my attention to Lucius and Lucy.  “It’ll all be okay, honey,” Mahesh assured, placing a hand on my knee.  “We’ll get it all sorted out.”

He might as well have not said those words at all because I didn’t catch any of it.  My focus was set on something already.  Lucius was too distracted by the dog toy in his hand to look up, giving her the sickly perfect chance.

A pair of beady eyes stared directly into mine.  As if time stood still, she watched me, seemingly aware of the conversation taking place.  The feeling of being an intruder in my own home returned, all too similar to the majority of the day.  My breathing stopped, fear surging through me like a tidal wave.

“Ellice!” a sharp voice broke me out of my trance.  I whipped my head towards Mahesh, my heart still racing a mile a minute.  “Did you hear me?” he asked, lightly caressing my knee with his thumb.  The small gesture helped me to calm my nerves slightly enough to speak.  “I-I did,” I lied, looking back at Lucy.  Her previous behavior was gone, changed back into her playful puppy attitude like a light switch.

Mahesh gently patted my leg, bringing me back to reality.  He sighed and stood up, scratching the back of his neck.  “It’s been a long day for all of us,” he started, looking at me sympathetically.  “We could all use a good night’s rest, especially you.  I’ll put Lucy away and you can take Lucius up.  I’ll be there to tuck him in.”  I nodded, slowly moving up from the couch.

Mahesh informed him that it was bedtime and to tell Lucy good night.  He gave her a quick hug, his small hands sinking into her fur.  I wished so badly to rip him away and throw Lucy out of my house.  He shouldn’t be hugging her like that.

Mahesh whistled at Lucy, signaling for her to follow him.  She followed closely, the clacking of nails along the floor making me nervous.  I stood up quickly and went toward Lucius, holding out my hand.  “Let’s go, Lu.” I said as he took my hand.  “Okay, momma.” he replied with a yawn.

I sat on Lucius’ bed, my hand grasping the warm area of his leg from under the blankets.  I moved it up to his face, brushing some hair from his green eyes.  “Did you have a good day, Lu?” I asked, giving his cheek a quick pinch.  “I did, momma,” he responded with a smile as bright as the sun.  “Playing with Lucy was super fun too!”  I gave him a nervous smile and looked away, debating whether I should ask him the question that’s been on my mind all afternoon.

“Hey, Lu?” I bit the bullet, trying to hide the concern in my voice.  “Has Lucy tried you in any way?” I questioned, my eyes meeting those of the confused boy.  “Nope!” he replied happily.  “Lucy wouldn’t do that.  We just played.”  “Oh, a-all right then,” I said with a swallow, my palms becoming sweaty.

Lucius yawned again.  “Why didn’t Lucy eat the salty tuna?” he asked, rubbing his eyes.  “Dadda said she didn’t want it today.”  “T-t-that’s…” I stuttered, clenching my hands together to keep them from shaking.  “That’s why, Lu.  Sometimes we don’t want to eat our favorite food, and that’s what Lucy’s feeling today.”  “That makes… sense,” Lucius replied with his eyebrows scrunched, still confused.

I moved my fingers across his forehead, feeling every soft strand of hair under my fingers.  My baby boy truly is my angel.  He’s so sweet and innocent, so small and fragile.  I don’t care if Satan himself came, I would protect him at all costs.

“Ah,” I exclaimed, holding up my pointer finger playfully, also in an attempt to distract myself.  “I have an idea, Lu.”  “What is it?” he giggled, kicking his feet.  “We should make a code word,” I told him, gently grasping his hand.  “If a person, animal, or anything tries to hurt you, you need to have a word to shout from the top of your lungs.”  “And you’ll come save me?” he added, beaming.  “Of course,” I assured him with a comforting smile.  “Either your dadda or I will come rushing as soon as you say it.”

“What’s the word?” he exclaimed, bouncing in his bed.  “Calm down,” I told him sweetly, placing a hand on his chest to signal to stay still.  I brought my finger to my lips and tapped against them as I thought of an easy word for a six year old.  “Tuna!” Lucius exclaimed, bouncing once again.  “I’ll yell ‘tuna’ and you and Dadda can come save me!”

I laughed slightly, giving his hand a squeeze.  “That settles it then,” I began.  “‘Tuna’ is the magic word.”  He giggled, repeating the word before laughing again.

“Remember, Lucius,” I started, my tone becoming more serious.  “Only use it when you’re in danger.”  He nodded, slightly frightened by my change in mood.  I gave him a small smile and leaned down to kiss him.  “Good night, Lu,” I told him, his warm face meeting my lips.  “Good night, momma,” he yawned before giving me a kiss in return.

I walked out of his room slowly, not wanting to let him out of my sight.  Before I had more answers, this was the most I could do.  Just a simple code word.  “*I pray I never have to hear it.*”

One might’ve thought I was dead.  I’m not sure if anyone tried to wake me up, but if my phone hadn’t rung, I probably would’ve slept until noon.  My eyelids fluttered, refusing to stay open completely.  I inhaled sharply as if in a panic.  After rubbing my stinging eyes, I quickly reached for my phone on the nightstand.

“*Mahesh?*” I questioned in my head, rubbing my eyes once more.  “*Isn’t he sleeping next to me?*”  Without bothering to check the schrodinger's cat in my bed, I answered the phone.

“Yeah?” I yawned, small tears forming in the corner of my eyes.  A small laugh could be heard from the other side of the phone.  “Did I wake you?” Mahesh asked with a playful tone.  “I guess so,” I replied, glancing over at the empty spot in the bed.

“Sorry for not waking you,” he continued, shifting to a casual voice.  “You were practically passed out.  I figured that you were really stressed from yesterday so I let you sleep in.”

“Oh, I see,” I replied with a chuckle.  “Well, thank you for that.  I didn’t realize I was that tired either.”  He laughed, “You can go back to sleep if you want.  Lucius is safe at school and I already fed Lucy and put her outside.”

“Ugh, jeez,” I sighed, pinching the bridge of my nose.  “I’m sorry you were put on the whole morning routine.  I won’t be like this tomorrow.”  “Don’t worry about it, Ellice.  It’s not like this happens all the time.  You were stressed and tired, no biggie.”

“Thank you, honey,” I praised, finally getting up from my bed.  “I’ll pay you back for dinner if you pick up your favorite.”  “Really?” Mahesh laughed.  “I might let you sleep in all the time if this is the result.”  I rolled my eyes, “Not paying for your food is just as easy as paying for it.”  “Yes, ma’am.”

“Alright, baby,” Mahesh began, ending with a sigh.  “I have to get back to work now.  Call me if anything happens with Lucy, but you shouldn’t have to interact with her too much.”  “Got it,” I replied with more disappointment in my voice than I meant to show.  “Have a good day, Mahesh.”  I blew him a kiss over the phone.  After he did the same, a dial tone played.

I stood there for a moment, my brain trying to adjust to the difference in routine.  The lack of the normal, hectic morning that helped me prepare for the day left me feeling groggy.  I raised my arms to stretch, letting out an audible yawn.  Unintentionally or not, my eyes traveled toward the window overlooking the backyard.  I swallowed a newly formed lump in my throat, walking toward the glass.

I inched my head over the ledge at a snail’s pace, hoping to see a happy dog chasing some butterfly.  Perhaps everything could magically become normal again, but I knew better.  As I peered out the yard, more dying grass coming into view, I caught a glimpse of a head of fur.  I froze for a moment, afraid of what lay ahead.  I continued the movement, my heart racing as my breathing quickened.

Two large, black eyes stared up at me from the yard.  I was a fool to hope for anything different.  Her eyes peered at me, seemingly knowing when I would look.  Perhaps she was always staring in the first place.

I jumped back, more afraid than I should’ve been.  This was nothing new by this point.  I turned to look at my phone.  “*It’s not anything different, but I’ll still let him know.*”  After sending a quick, “the dogs staring at me again,” I rubbed my eyes and headed out of my room.  I still had my job as well.

My office didn’t feel as roomy as it usually did, and the window facing the backyard certainly didn’t help.  Despite the bile building up in my stomach, I made my way in, sitting in my chair.

“*First things first, emails.*”  Opening up the tab, I didn’t expect to see anything unusual.  There were the standard project check-ins, upcoming meeting reminders, and Desiree accidentally hitting ‘reply all’ again.  Sandwiched in between the messages was a sender that caught my eye, “[janson.clara12@chmail.com](mailto:janson.clara12@chmail.com).”  I clicked on the email, too confused to read the subject line.

*Dear Mrs. Iyer,*

*Good morning, I hope this email finds you well.  Let me start with saying that everything is fine with Lucius.  In fact, he’s as happy as he was when you first got your dog.  He’s not even in my class anymore but I can hear him from the next room over.  I’m sure he’s just as bubbly around the house as well.*

*I’m contacting you regarding a conversation I heard as I was passing his classroom.  I think he was talking to another girl, but he mentioned waiting for Lucy to act the same.  He said she was scaring you and he doesn’t think it’s really her.  Well, that’s what I gathered from a children’s conversation.  I remembered our talk from last year and figured I should still inform you.*

*Please let me know if there’s anything I can do on my end.  I hope you have a nice day.*

*Sincerely,*

*Clara Janson*

I froze in place, my hand hovering over my mouse.  Lucius had noticed the entire time.  Despite Lucy acting almost the same around him, he doesn’t think it’s our Lucy.  My throat began to tighten as my face grew hot.  A million thoughts raced through my mind, wondering why he didn’t tell me or if he was scared of her in some way but just didn’t show it.

After taking a deep breath, I sent her back an email thanking her and asking her to keep an ear out for anything he might say.

“*Just one more day,*” I thought to myself, massaging my temples.  “*Just one more day and everything will all be explained.*”  I laid my head down next to the keyboard, the immense amount of sleep the night before not doing its job.

“*Will everything be explained?*” the thought crept into my mind.  “*What if it’s not?  What if it all gets brushed aside and nothing is done?*”  I glanced up at the window, the nausea bubbling in my stomach, begging me not to look.  “*I’ll throw that damn dog out myself.*”

The rest of the day went without incident.  I ignored Lucy the entire time and only went downstairs to eat.  Like a child through dark halls, I peeked around the corner to make sure she wasn’t looking at me through the backyard doors.  Per usual, she was, her eyes becoming more sickly the more they met mine.

I waited anxiously for Mahesh to get home, unable to focus on my work or anything that would be usually relaxing to me.  It was just so awful.  Every hour gave me an ounce of relief, but it was a drop in the ocean compared to the knot in my stomach.

Finally, my body relaxed with the sound of the front door opening.  “Mommy!” Lucius cried out from the front of the house, small thumps making their way closer.  Faster than I thought he could go, he burst into my room, leaping from the floor and onto my bed.  He crawled his way across and I grabbed him to pull him into a hug.  He giggled as I kissed his face and hair.

“Did you sleep all day, momma?” he asked, eyes big in amazement.  “No, Lu,” I laughed, hoisting him up onto my leg.  “I just woke up from a nap.”  “*Well, trying to nap.*”

Mahesh came up soon after, looking much more lively than the day before.  He wore a warm smile with an undertone of concern.  “That’s good,” he began while making his way to the bed.  He leaned across the bed and planted a kiss on my cheek.  “Did you leave the room at all?” he joked with a sarcastic tone and a snarky smile plastered on his face.  “Yes, I did,” I replied with an eye roll louder than my words.

“Dadda brought home China food!” Lucius butted in, bouncing on my leg.  “Can we eat now?”  “We can, buddy,” Mahesh replied.  “Go put your school stuff down.”  Just as fast as he jumped into my room, Lucius left.  His nearly empty backpack bouncing with every step.  Mahesh chuckled before turning to me.

“How did everything go with Lucy?” he asked, sitting on the bed to remove his shoes.  “Fine, honestly,” I responded, letting my back slouch.  “I mainly just ignored her all day.”  “Was she still staring at you?”  I laughed nervously, “What do you think?  She just knows exactly where I’m going to go.”

He laid down on the bed, his head resting on my lap.  “Well, that’s every dog that’s been left out for a while,” he stated, looking up at the ceiling.  “Yeah, but she would’ve been jumping at the door a year ago,” I mentioned, brushing his oily hair with my fingers.  “Especially if she was hungry or thirsty.”  “Well,” he began with a sigh.  “The appointment is tomorrow morning, so we’ll get everything explained.”

I stared at the buttons on his shirt, my worries from the day before coming back to mind.  “Lucius doesn’t think the dog is Lucy,” I blurted out.  Mahesh’s eyes immediately locked on mine.  “Or rather, he knows she’s acting differently than she usually does.  I got an email from his former teacher saying that he was talking to another girl about waiting for her to act like Lucy again.”

Mahesh scrunched his eyebrows in confusion, asking, “What?  Did he mention anything like that to you?”  I shook my head in defeat, feeling as if I failed somehow.  “Not a single word,” I told him with a sigh.

He stretched his hands up, bringing them to my head.  He placed his fingers on my temples with a slight pressure, moving them in circles.  “It’ll be alright,” he began, a light smile appearing on his face.  “We’ll sort everything out, Ellice.”  He then laughed, “And then we’ll feel stupid for worrying so much in the first place.”  I let out a slight chuckle, relieving more tension than I thought it would.  “Yeah,” I began, the stresses of the day fading away with every passing second.  “I hope so.”  

He then wrapped his hands around my head and pulled me in for a kiss, making an audible ‘mwah’ sound along with it.  “Alright Ellice,” he started, the rumbling of his stomach interrupting us.  “Let’s go eat.”

And that’s what we did.  Mahesh checked on Lucy, and it looked like she did eat her food that was left out from the morning.  That put me slightly at ease.  My stomach still churned every time I caught her looking at me, but this was a start.  The rest of the evening flew by without a single problem.

I’m writing this now after we went to bed.  I couldn’t fall asleep so I figured I’d ask the internet if there has been any other occurrence like this.  There seemed to be a lot of stories about strange happenings here, so I figured I’d try my luck.

The vet appointment is tomorrow morning, and it’s brought me more anxiety than comfort.  I don’t care how minuscule, if you have a single idea about what might be going on, please let me know.
