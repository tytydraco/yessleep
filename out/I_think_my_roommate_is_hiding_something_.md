"Did you check the reel I sent you last night? It's hilarious!" I said while sipping my morning coffee, looking at my phone. I could finally relax for a bit.

Nasheed didn't answer. 

I glanced up, only to catch him staring at his hands absent-mindedly. Dude wasn't even blinking. I frowned and called him again, loudly. He almost jumped from his skin, spilling some orange juice on the table. 

"Y-yeah? Sorry, I-" he trailed off. 

"You okay?" 

"I'm, I'm fine." He tried to smile.  

I perused Nasheed's face. He ticked all of the boxes for great genetics. I mean, this guy had gotten shit ton of chocolates and letters on Valentine's Day for 3 years straight. I sometimes caught him on his phone, cheeks all red. When I snatched it away, I saw his inbox filled with the craziest confessions. I jokingly said that his fans would probably open a shrine one day. On top of that, his family was super rich. Dream life, no?

So when I told you that Nasheed resembled a ghost, take it literally. Sunken, hollow eyes devoid of life. His usually slick hair was now unkempt. Sallow, pearly skin. Cheekbones so protruding that they'd make a model jealous. The hell?

"Man, what's up? Are you feeling sick?"

Nasheed rubbed his temples.

And then I saw it. 



For a second.



His eyes turned dark.



Just for a second. Then normal again. Probably a trick of light?



He sighed.

 "I don't know, Nibir. I've been feeling terrible for the past 4 days. You were busy with coursework, that's why I didn't bother you."

 Well, this was an excuse. I knew that Nasheed refrained from sharing his problems with anyone, but damn, this seemed serious. The mountains of deadlines I had prevented me from noticing such a drastic change. His voice, which was as beautiful as his name, sounded hoarse. I got up and came to his side. When I put my hand on Nasheed's shoulder, I was surprised by how cold it felt, even through the thick fabric. He flinched slightly. 

"I am booking an appointment. I'll break your jaw if you say no." 



The doctor concluded that Nasheed was just extremely tired from the heavy course load and that he should rest and drink a lot of water. Yada yada. Deep down, however, I sensed something was wrong. We were talking about the man who worked for 15 hours straight without collapsing (He said he didn't mind. Insanity if you ask me). I nagged Nasheed relentlessly for the next few days to dig out the issue, but he just refused and stated that he was alright. Liar. I'd lived with him long enough as roommates to identify that at least. 

"Why the fuck are you being so stubborn? Just tell me, Nash. You can't continue like this." 

Nasheed exhaled with great difficulty, drooping his head. After a while, he raised his thinning hand to shoo me away. Feeling hurt, I stormed out of his room. This was the first time we fought. 

I did make small talk after the initial tension dissolved, but it always progressed to silence. Yes, I’m a shitty friend, but hey, perhaps he just wanted some space. Nasheed had informed the university of his sickness, staying shut in his room all day as a result. We still ate together, but he avoided meeting my eye. His condition remained the same more or less. Even so, I could tell that he was struggling with something. 



Occasionally, when I woke up at night to drink water, I'd take a peep at his room. I swear I could see a black shadow slipping inside the door’s crack. Maybe I was just groggy?

I realised I wasn't hallucinating when my sleep was interrupted by a nightmare. I gasped awake, immediately sensing a macabre presence. I shivered. When did the temperature drop? 

 With shaky hands, I switched on the light. Nothing-



A shadow.

 

Slipping past my door. I barely saw it. I spent the rest of the night covered in my blanket, not getting a wink of sleep.



I had classes starting from 8:30 a.m up to 12 pm . Due to my unpleasant nighttime experience, I trudged through campus, begging myself to pay attention to mundane lectures. I missed Nasheed. It was lonely without him. Of course, my extrovert attitude garnered many friends, but the shy, introverted nerd was the yin to my yang. I decided to directly confront him about his troubles after going home. As I brought out my phone, horror struck me- it was dead. In the hurry, charging it slipped past me. What a lovely morning.

I pumped caffeine in my blood to keep myself pushing. The shadow thing wouldn’t leave my mind. What the heck was it? Did Nasheed have any idea? Honestly, I was creeped out. As soon as the clock struck 12, I was gone with the wind.

Have you ever encountered complete silence? Like the *absolute* absence of sound. I could hear my heart beating as I entered our apartment. Stepping cautiously, I was greeted by darkness. Mind you, this building let in a good amount of sunlight even when the curtains were drawn. However, it looked as though the brightness was sucked in. I fumbled with the switch. No luck. Despite knowing there was no electricity, I plugged my phone in the charger after my eyes barely adjusted. It lit up. Eh?

“Nasheed?” I called out nervously whilst waiting for my phone to display the home screen.

“Yeah?” came the reply. I froze.

Why did his voice sound like that? It was sort of…mechanical?

Bing!

I yelped when the notification popped up. 1 message from Romeo (Nasheed’s nickname, as you can guess).

“Nibir, I tried to contact you, but you didn’t respond. I told Baba to send a car to pick me up. Gonna be at home for a while. And I am sorry for what I did. I promise I’ll explain everything. I just need some time.”



I stared at the text in disbelief. Who the heck spoke to me just now?



Laughter.



Chills ran down my spine. I strained my eyes to see.



“Turn on your flashlight, dipshit.” It said in a raspy, exasperated tone.

A moving mass emerged from Nasheed’s room. The temperature dropped abruptly, raising goosebumps on my skin. Two glowing red orbs fixed their gaze on me. My vision cleared for a bit. I wish it didn’t. This thing… was shifting. If liquid ink were a person, it would be similar to that. And God, the face. Sometimes it looked like Nasheed. And then like mine. And then both of us, at once. The only features that didn’t change were its eyes and mouth. It was *sneering* at me, showing jagged teeth.

“Aw, are you scared? It mocked. “Is poor little Nimo going to run?” 

My heart dropped to my stomach. Nimo was the pet name given to me by my mom. She passed away years ago. How did it know?

The shadow glided forward, standing a few feet away from me. Ever so slowly, I pocketed my phone while backing away. My entire body was sweating profusely despite the coldness. I bumped into the sofa, leading me to buckle up in pain.

It rolled its eyes. “Tsk, tsk, you are SO pathetic it’s funny. I wonder why Nasheed even considered being friends with you. Did you ever realise that he was suffering? Oh, such pity. You are always so full of yourself, how would you notice?

My head spun. What bullshit was it spewing? 

“Wh-What do- do you mean?” I squeaked.

It let out a blood-curdling chuckle. “I really want to rip out that brain of yours and study it. *Think,* you wuss. Reflect on your friendship. Or should I say, ahem, your usage of Nasheed. Don’t you fucking dare act surprised.” It saw my eyes go wide. “He pretended to not understand your motives. For 3 whole years. He knew you were downright envious of him. Yet, he clung to you desperately. You were the closest person in his life. But what did you do, asshat? When you saw the attention he got from everyone, you were blinded by jealousy. Soooo”, it hissed, “little wittle Nibir decided to hatch a plan. He became friends with the timid Greek God and started to incorporate himself in his life. More and more. His admirers gradually became your friends, too, hmm? Oh, why did I forget the girlssss? When was the last time you had a girlfriend? 5 years ago? 6?”

“You are lying!” I cried. I wanted this to stop. It was getting harder to breathe.

The thing now stood before me. I cowered in fear. 

I blurted out, “Who- who are you?”

“Who am I? Such a philosophical question”, it guffawed, sending tremors down my torso. “Well, you could say I’m a manifestation of Nasheed’s anger and frustration. He was quite good at hiding it, ya know? He yearned to break free, but at the same time  couldn’t bear losing you. I got attracted to the tremendous negative energy that he was unable to contain anymore. He wanted to protect you, douchebag. Aaaand, you hated that he lived a posh, happy life, amirite? Guess what, his stepmother emotionally abused him in his childhood. He was always told that he wasn’t good enough. Why do you think he turned out this way?”

I couldn’t say anything. Fuck it, what was there to say? The shadow ceased the alternating of faces and bent down inches from my nose. Its voice became menacing.



“Listen up, shithead. I’m letting you go this time, but remember, I’ll always be around. Now that I’ve materialized, I can easily bring upon destruction, ya hear? If I catch you doing dirty tricks again, I’ll *hunt* you down. Wherever you are.”



With a shrill ‘WHOOSH’, it vanished. The apartment was bathed in sunlight instantly. I broke down, hot tears streaming down my face. Utter despair wrapped me from all sides. Eventually, I gathered myself up and texted Nasheed that I was coming to his house to talk things out. 



Wish me luck.
