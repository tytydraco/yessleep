I named him Hannibal after the Carthaginian general. Not because I expected him to cross the Alps or outmaneuver Roman legions, but because I have a habit of naming my pets after historical figures. I was in the military for a while—history’s always been my thing.

Hannibal came into my life about six years ago. A scrawny, beat-up tabby who wandered into my backyard one winter and never really left. He got a little chubby over the years, lazy even, but he was my cat. He liked to sit on my desk while I worked, or curl up on my chest while I watched TV. Standard cat stuff.

And then, four days ago, the FBI took him.

I thought it was a prank at first. A weird one, sure, but what else do you think when two guys in dark windbreakers knock on your door and flash FBI badges? I spent long enough in the service to know a fake badge when I see one. These were real. And so was the warrant they shoved in my face before pushing past me into my house.

“What’s this about?” I asked. I hadn’t broken any laws. No weird online activity. No shady dealings. Hell, I don’t even have parking tickets.

“Just a routine investigation,” one of them said.

“What kind of investigation?”

“Can’t disclose that.”

That was how the next ten minutes went. Me asking increasingly frustrated questions, and them dodging every single one. I could’ve stopped them, maybe—forced them to explain what the hell they were doing in my home—but I knew better. Interfering with a federal investigation is a one-way ticket to making your life a lot harder than it needs to be. So I watched.

They checked everything. Closets. Cabinets. Under the couches. They even opened the fridge at one point, which made me snort because what, did they think I was hiding a fugitive behind the milk?

Then one of them dropped to his knees and peered under my bed. He went very still for a second before muttering, “Gotcha.”

I barely had time to process that before he pulled back, tugging something with him—Hannibal.

My cat, my slightly overweight, middle-aged brown tabby, hissed and writhed in his grip, his claws raking wildly against the agent’s hand. The guy swore under his breath and nodded to his partner, who handed him a pair of thick, heavy-duty gloves—the kind you’d use for handling dangerous animals.

“Whoa, whoa, whoa—what the hell are you doing?” I demanded, stepping forward.

The agent barely spared me a glance as he struggled to get a firm grip on Hannibal. “Stay back, sir.”

“That’s my cat!”

Hannibal let out a scream—I didn’t even know cats could make noises like that. It was raw and panicked, the sound of a cornered animal. He twisted and bit down hard on the agent’s wrist. The man yelled and yanked his arm back, and his partner swore.

“Careful!” the second guy snapped. “Make sure it doesn’t touch exposed skin.”

It?

The first agent finally wrestled Hannibal into the cage the second guy had unfolded. They snapped it shut, latched it, then stood up and turned for the door like this was just another Tuesday.

I stepped in front of them. “You can’t just take my cat.”

The agent with the scratch mark locked eyes with me. His face was pale, sweat beading on his forehead. “Interfering with a federal investigation is a crime,” he reminded me.

I could feel my pulse hammering in my throat, but I forced my voice to stay even. “Then tell me what the hell you’re investigating.”

“You’ll be informed if and when the investigation concludes.”

And just like that, they were out the door.

They put Hannibal—still yowling—into the back of a classic Mustang. That detail sticks with me because, seriously, what kind of feds drive a vintage muscle car to an operation? It didn’t fit. None of this fit.

I watched them pull away, my cat locked in the cage between them, and then I stood in my doorway for a long time, trying to make sense of what had just happened.

I called the police an hour later, still half-convinced this was some kind of mistake. Maybe a case of mistaken identity? Maybe Hannibal looked like some rare breed of smuggled feline and they’d realize their error and bring him back?

But when I spoke to the cops, they just told me, “The FBI confirmed the agents were legitimate. We can’t give you any more details at this time.”

That was it. That was all they would say.

It’s been four days now. Four days without Hannibal. No calls, no updates. I’ve scoured every corner of the internet for anything—any possible reason why federal agents would kick down someone’s door and confiscate a housecat.

Nothing.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know why this happened.

I just want my cat back.
