part one 

Amnesia and sudden marriage to my first love'  i read the caption, of a black screen on my tiktok for you page. "what the hell does that mean?" 

I look up from my phone. My friend Robin has been getting this video on her page, its just a black screen, saying something in Chinese. The most unsettling part was the music that played. Uncanny. 

"This video keeps popping up, this is like the 5th time" she said with annoyance . The video is so unsettling. Why can't we share the video? Is this a real video? It has reposts, i don't get it. 

"Maybe its like the next ring, like instead of a tape, its a video on tiktok!" Angela said trying to ease the uncomfortably of the video and the deafening silence at the dinner table. The type quietness that makes you want to just cough to stop the awkwardness 

Angela and Robin are two good friends of mine, I've known them for 7 years. We met in middle school and have been together since. We've graduated this may and just trying to get by as newly adults 

"leave a comment, just in case the video comes up again" I said, Robin started to type her comment, the sound of her fingers tapping the glass on her phone was the only thing we could focus on. I wanted to take a screenshot of the video to to see if anyone on my public story had seen the same video too.

\*Click\* i began pressing on the power button and bottom volume button. 'Tiktoks can't be screenshoted' the hell? I swear I could screenshot, I scroll up. \*click\* i take a screenshot of the next video. 'Screenshot saved to gallery' 

"Angela, im gonna send the video to you." I clicked Angela's profile and shared the video to her. She opens her dms "video dosent exist" she spoke, she shifted in her seat. The tension in the room killed the laughter we had a few minutes before the video came up. 

"we should just ignore it, I don't think this video is anything big." Robin said, she placed her phone face down on the table to stay off of it. 

A few minutes passed of small talk with gaps in between. "I gotta head home, i have work in the morning." My eyes directed twords the 3 pained window, its 6 pm but dark, the blinds were open and you could hear the wind. The south plains are wind central. Texas gets real dark in the winter and 40 degrees made going out very hard. I grab my jacket, it hung on the chair to the left of me. I said my goodbyes and got into my car turning the heater on. 

My Bluetooth connected, music played as normal, singing along to original Panic! Made my nerves ease. I need to know more about this video, i love creepy media and unsettling things but because its happening in real time. Im obsessed. 

Im posting this to see if anyone else has seen or knows anything about this video. I will update if anything happens.
