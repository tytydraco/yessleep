I’d heard the stories. Everyone had. About the Whispering Stalker, a creature that roamed the forests, stalking its prey with a slow, relentless pace. They say you hear it first—a whisper just behind you, low and coaxing, calling your name. Then you start to feel it, a presence lurking just out of sight, getting closer, always closer. The last thing you hear before it takes you is the sound of its dry, rasping breath in your ear.

I’d never believed the stories. Not until I found out who it really was. The truth was that it was a man in his late 20s, finding young women to murder and use to his hearts content. I found that out from my Uncle, a police officer who warned me of who my father really was and why he worked so late. The story was burried by the town, but it couldn't disappear from me. 

I was hanging out at Chris’s place one afternoon when I mentioned it, the usual cryptid banter. "You ever heard of the Whispering Stalker?" I asked casually, sipping my soda.  

Chris snorted. “It’s just another one of those creepy stories people tell around campfires. Like that damn Wendigo crap.”  

Mia, who’d been listening quietly, frowned. “No way. My aunt told me about it when we were kids. She said it was real. People went missing out in those woods.”  

I laughed, but I wasn’t really joking. I could see it in their eyes. They were already buying it. And that’s when I planted the seed.  

“You know,” I said, leaning in like I was sharing some big secret, “there’s a place, not far from here. It’s where the Stalker’s been spotted the most. They say you can hear it if you’re quiet enough. If you listen long enough, you’ll hear it whispering your name, calling you in.”  

Mia shifted uncomfortably. “That’s messed up, man.”  

Chris was more skeptical. “You really think we should go looking for this thing? Sounds like a joke.”  

I let that doubt settle in the air. “I don’t know. I think it might be worth checking out. We could hike into those woods tonight, see if we hear anything. If nothing happens, we turn back. If we hear something… well, maybe we’ll be the ones to prove it’s real.”  

Mia hesitated. “I’m not so sure about this…”  

“Come on,” I said, keeping my voice light. “It’ll be fun. We’re not really gonna find the Whispering Stalker. It’s just a story, right?”  

Mia finally gave in, probably because she didn’t want to seem like the scared one. Chris reluctantly agreed too, but I could tell he wasn’t fully on board.  

That night, we met up in the woods. It was cold, the moon hidden behind clouds, casting the forest in a thick, dark blanket. We had our flashlights, but the beams barely cut through the trees. I could feel the tension between us, and I knew it was the perfect time to make it real.  

I led the way, pretending to look for signs of the Stalker—scratches on trees, disturbed ground. I let the silence grow, let the tension build.  

Then, I made my move.  

I started to whisper—just faintly at first. A low, barely audible sound, something that might be mistaken for the wind or the rustling of leaves. But it wasn’t. It was me, using a recording I made a few days prior. 

At first, Chris and Mia barely noticed. Then, I made it louder, clearer, like a whisper right behind them.  

“*Chris... Mia...*”  

They stopped dead in their tracks. I watched as their faces shifted from confused to terrified. I let it hang in the air for a moment before I spoke again, this time a little louder. “*Come closer...*”  

Mia’s eyes went wide. She looked around, her breath quickening. “Did you hear that?”  

Chris laughed nervously, but it was shaky. “Okay, okay, that’s enough. This isn’t funny anymore.”  

I didn’t stop. I couldn’t. “*Come closer...*”  

Mia’s voice was trembling now. “Please, can we just go back?”  

But it was too late. I’d already set it in motion.  

In a panic, I grabbed the rope from my bag. I was quick, but calm. I had them where I wanted them. Chris.. Tripped.. backward into the underbrush, and Mia froze, trying to understand what was happening.  

I didn’t give them the chance to fight back.  

The forest was still. The wind had stopped. It was so quiet that all I could hear was their panicked breathing and my own. I watched as the fear set in, as they realized what was happening. The Stalker wasn’t coming for them. I was.  

It was quick. Too quick. A few stabs, just enough to keep them quiet, and it was over. Their bodies were heavy on the ground, their faces twisted in fear, still trying to scream but unable to. I didn’t feel anything. Not guilt, not fear. Just… satisfaction. I had continued what my father had to stop. 

I dragged their bodies deeper into the woods, making it look like the Stalker had taken them. There were signs, broken twigs, torn fabric. No one would suspect me. No one ever did.  

The next morning, I went home. I washed the blood off my hands. I acted like nothing happened.  

But then, tonight...  

I was lying in bed, replaying the events in my mind, my heart racing from the thrill of it. I was drifting off to sleep when I heard it.  

That faint whisper.  

At first, I thought it was just the wind, the trees. But then I heard it again.  

“*Alex… Alex…*”  

I froze. My blood went cold.  

It wasn’t my mind playing tricks.  

The whisper came again. Closer this time.  

“*Come closer...*”  

I slowly turned my head, and there, standing just outside my window, was a figure.  

It wasn’t tall, not like I expected. It was hunched, its face hidden under a dark hood. Its body was long and thin, like a twisted version of a man. And from beneath the hood, I saw its eyes glowing faintly, yellow and unblinking.  

The Whispering Stalker wasn’t a story.  

It was real.  

And it was waiting for me. To punish me for doing its job.
