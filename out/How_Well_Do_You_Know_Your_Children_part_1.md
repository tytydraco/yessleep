People pretend to understand their children’s lives, but in truth, they’re often lying to themselves or their friends to save face. You wouldn’t believe how many crying mothers come to me, desperate to find their kids, only to discover them in some drug den, squandering their “college money.” That’s other people’s kids, right? Never your precious angel. But that’s the lie we tell ourselves. 
Despite our best efforts, our children are their own people, free to use their will as they choose. 

I did everything right in my parents’ eyes, especially my father’s. I graduated high school, went straight to the police academy, and climbed the ranks in my midsized city. I became the youngest chief homicide detective, partly because the previous chief succumbed to a brutal heroin addiction. 

It wasn’t long before I met Jessica, the love of my life, the most beautiful brunette God ever created. That is, until our daughter, Becca, was born—she became my entire world. Watching her grow, exploring the wonders around her, was what I looked forward to every day. Everything changed when Becca turned fourteen. 

It wasn’t teenage angst; it was Jessica’s stage-four ovarian cancer diagnosis. We were the perfect family until then—family dinners, summer vacations, never missing Becca’s extracurriculars. After the diagnosis, we grew stronger for a time, but watching the brightest light in your life fade to nothing would break even the strongest man. Seeing my frail wife take her last breath changed my fourteen-year-old daughter. 

Becca dropped all her activities and threw herself into her studies. As a father, I was proud of my honor student, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss her talking to me. Her high school years passed like this, but I stayed positive at home. I never wanted her to carry the weight of her broken father. 

That is until I was alone in the big, empty room where I once held my beautiful wife, the darkness sank in. It’s hard to describe the horror of that solitude. I’d sit in the middle of my bed, the walls racing in opposite directions, my skin shivering as a black hole opened in my chest, pulling in the misery the walls fled from. I didn’t cry or moan—just trembled, wishing tears would release me from that cosmic pressure. 

You might think opening up to Becca or seeking family counseling would’ve helped. I tried. For two years after Jessica’s death, we saw grief counselors, psychiatrists, you name it. It stopped the day Becca came home from school, tears in her eyes, and said, “Please, no more shrinks, Dad. They can’t bring Mom back.” Her words confused me—no one was trying to resurrect Jessica. I said, “They’re just helping you process, sweetheart.” She looked at her fidgeting hands and whispered, “I know. I just want it to stop.” That day, I saw a pain in her deeper than at her mother’s funeral. I canceled all future sessions. 

When I dropped her off at college in the next state, I told her how proud I was. She hugged me tightly and said something that seared into me: “You don’t have to pretend to be strong anymore.” It was four years before she contacted me again. 

I lasted six months before I started drinking. Even though Becca rarely spoke when she was home, she gave me purpose, a reason to hold it together. But her words haunted me like a broken record: “You don’t have to pretend to be strong anymore.” I kept my job for another six months before taking early retirement at fifty. I wasn’t ready to stop working, but my drinking had taken over, affecting my ability to lead. I’d sneak drinks at work, chuckling to myself, “At least it’s not heroin—this job must be cursed.” I didn’t want to end up a disgrace like my predecessor, so retirement was the logical choice. 

I sold my home, downsized to a smaller place, hoping the walls wouldn’t race away. They did, and the void in my chest remained. With my remaining money, I bought a small office and became a private investigator, figuring I was the only boss who wouldn’t fire me for drinking. 

The next three years blurred with cases of infidelity, wayward kids, and odd jobs—until Becca called. At three a.m., I woke groggy, still buzzed, but her voice sobered me instantly. “Daddy, please come get me,” she said, followed by unintelligible garble. I always knew her location through Find My iPhone—not to stalk her, but because I never stopped paying her bills to support her through college. 

Her annual transcripts, sent without words, were her way of saying she was okay and thanking me. I didn’t need her calls, just confirmation she was safe. 

That night, she was ready. I drove like a man possessed to an oversized frat party. There, I found a brown-haired, blue-eyed girl slumped against a red sports car. It was Becca, just sleeping. I carried her to my car. 

The next morning, she woke to the smell of pancakes and me in the kitchen. Despite her hangover, her face lit up, and she rushed me with a bear hug, apologizing for not calling, saying she loved me over and over. Apparently, a sorority girl bragging about a Lake Tahoe trip with her father had triggered her, leading to drunken tears and her call to me. 

That sorority girl was the best thing to happen to me in years—she gave me my daughter back. Becca was now the happy, strong woman her mother had been before the cancer. Over the next few days, she shared her life: her law major, her love for yoga, and why she’d stayed silent. 

She thought contacting me would drag me back into her pain, believing she was an anchor holding me down. She now knew that was never true. 

We started talking weekly. One day, she called about a guy she met at a coffee shop near her yoga class. They talked daily, but he hadn’t asked her out. She laughed, saying she’d give him one more chance tomorrow and promised to keep me posted. She never did. It’s been two years, and Becca still hasn’t been found. I’ll never stop looking for the man who took her.
