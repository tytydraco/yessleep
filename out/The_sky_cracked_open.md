I don’t talk about that night. No one would believe me anyway—not without seeing what I saw, hearing what I heard. But lately, something’s been humming in the back of my skull, like a signal waiting to be answered. I need to get this out before it gets worse.

It started with a hum.

I live alone on the outskirts of a dying town in northern Arizona. Closest neighbor is five miles off. That’s how I like it—quiet, undisturbed. I’m a night owl by habit, always fiddling with old ham radios in my shed, scanning through static like I might tune into God.

That night, it wasn’t God.

Around 2:13 AM, the static on my receiver snapped into something rhythmic. A pulse. Soft at first. Then louder. Then words. Not English. Not anything I knew. Just this garbled voice repeating something, glitching like a scratched CD: “Ek-sha… tik-ra… ek-sha… tik-ra…”

I froze. The signal wasn’t bouncing off anything local. I had the gear to tell—it was straight down from the sky. Direct.

My shed lights flickered. My radio shorted out. And then… silence. No crickets. No wind. Not even the buzz of the power lines out by the road. It was like the world had inhaled and forgotten how to exhale.

Then the sky cracked.

Not thunder. Not lightning. The damn sky cracked. Split in a jagged line of light—like a broken mirror bleeding white. And from that fissure, something slid out.

I couldn’t see it clearly at first—just movement. A shimmer, like oil on water, warping the air around it. Then it solidified. Tall. Lanky. Limbs too long, like someone stretched a human until it nearly broke.

It didn’t walk. It unfolded.

I didn’t move. I couldn’t. Every instinct told me not to blink, not to breathe. I was prey, and that thing… it was the trap.

It looked at me. No eyes, but I knew it looked. I felt it inside my head, like a cold needle threading through memories. Childhood. My father’s funeral. The first time I kissed a girl. All of it, sifted through in seconds. It tasted me.

Then it spoke—no mouth, no sound. Just a thought, loud as thunder and slick as oil.

“Not ready.”

I collapsed. I don’t remember falling, but I woke up in the dirt hours later, blood crusted around my nose and ears. My watch was frozen at 2:13 AM. The sky above was calm again. But there were footprints. Long, deep impressions—three-toed, like talons—leading away from the shed into the woods.

I should’ve run. Should’ve called someone. But curiosity’s a disease.

So I followed.

The woods were wrong. Trees leaning the wrong way, shadows twitching when nothing moved. The deeper I went, the quieter it got, until even my own footsteps stopped making sound.

I found the circle in a clearing. Burned into the earth. Charred, blackened, but pulsing faintly beneath the ash. In the center: a small, metallic cube. Smooth. No seams. No reflections. Just cold.

I picked it up. That was my second mistake.

The moment my fingers touched the metal, something clicked in my brain. Like a door opening. Images flooded my mind—flashes of cities melting, people levitating into beams of light, time collapsing into itself. A countdown started behind my eyes.

“Not ready,” the voice echoed again, fainter this time, as if buried behind glass.

When I woke up again, the cube was gone. But something else stayed.

Now I hear it every night—the hum. It’s louder now. Constant. There’s something beneath it, too. A whisper. Words I shouldn’t understand, but I do.

They’re coming back.

Not just for me. For everyone.

I think I was scanned. Tagged. Like some specimen in a petri dish. And that cube? It wasn’t a gift. It was a key.

I’ve seen the sky crack twice more since then—quick slits, gone in seconds. Always followed by lights in the trees, animals acting strange, electronics dying for no reason. The last time, my reflection didn’t match me. Just for a second. But it smiled.

I don’t sleep anymore. Not really. I see their shape in the fog, in my windows at night, hovering just behind the glass. Watching. Measuring.

Waiting for the countdown to end.

And it’s almost up.

They said I wasn’t ready.

But I think we all will be… soon.

And we won’t have a choice.

I’ll keep you updated….if I’m able. If I’m….me.
