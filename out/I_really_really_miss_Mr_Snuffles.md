I'm sure everyone has had an imaginary friend. Whether it be a little girl, a little boy. We'd always grow out of them and eventually they wouldn't visit as much.

Mine wasn't like that, tho. Mr Snuffles was not my first friend, I remember Carla when I was 5. She had curly blonde hair and ocean blue eyes. Next was Marc when I was 9. He preferred me calling him Mars tho, no biggie. I was into space at the time as well.

Then came Mr Snuffles. He wasn't exactly like the typical imaginary friend, Mr Snuffles was around 11 feet tall. He had a pale and slender frame to the point you could count his ribs exactly. He usually took refuge in my closet or under my bed or on particularly bad nights he would watch me by the windows. But sometimes when I felt nice I would clear up the corner of my rooms full of clothes for Mr Snuffles. 

Mr Snuffles never left my side. I've grown attached to him over the years, He talks to me now but in... inhuman whispers, mumbles and gurgles. But I can still understand what he's saying for some reason. It's like a universal language.

Mr Snuffles would stay with me when my parents were fighting, When I needed help with my homework, when mom and dad forgot to cook, Snuffles would make me close my eyes and bring me to the closet world. There would be a big long table full of delicious food. I would eat it with Mr Snuffles and even tho he had no face I could tell he was smiling. 

I've been to multiple psychiatrists, but all of them said Mr Snuffles was just a "coping mechanism". But I don't care, they all just wanna take him away from me. He never left me like dad did. He never drowned himself like mama. He even covered my ears when mom threw the bottle at dad.

They're all getting concerned now. As time passes I feel like Mr Snuffles is not so imaginary anymore. Maybe it's because I'm going thru a midlife crises, being in my 30's with an imaginary friend isn't really the norm.

Im approaching my 36th birthday now. Mr Snuffles said he's going to have to leave soon. But I don't want him to leave, he's all I got in this cruel stupid world. 

I know one way I can be with Mr Snuffles. Maybe if I leave this world I can stay with him forever in his. Mr Snuffles is heavily against this tho, so I've not been thinking about it. 

But today is different, I can't find Mr Snuffles anywhere. He's still here I know it. The bear jaw he gave me years ago is still sitting in the middle of the pentagram I drew for him so he could go to his world faster. 

Well it's too bad now I guess. Maybe he's figured out I'm giving him to the thing keeping him out of my room on those bad nights. Maybe he knows I'm good with that entity that's watching him from the windows but that doesn't matter. I've got all I need to go there and take Mr Snuffles back.

Once I give 3 imaginary friends to the Dreamstalker I'll finally be reborn into a normal happy family. I'm sorry Mr Snuffles but I've come so far and I won't risk it for you.
