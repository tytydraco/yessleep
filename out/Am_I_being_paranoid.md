Someone is behind me right now. I’m fairly certain. No, someone is DEFINITELY behind me. I can feel it.

I daren’t move. Hopefully I’m just being excessively paranoid.

I’ll explain. I have always been planning to go on a vacation to South Korea, as I have been locking myself up due to the pandemic. The government basically forced us to wear this band that tracks you and would alert you if you have left the house. These regulations are finally lifted, and I have been itching to go on a vacation. Yesterday, I finally arrived. I was LITERALLY over the moon. This hotel room is over 1000 square feet, which is way more spacious than my shitty 100 square foot apartment. It was suspiciously cheap though.

I explored the hotel room. There was this small cabinet that was covered in dust. It had a card on it that said "DO NOT OPEN". I am a curious person, so naturally I opened the cabinet. It had a rock in it that looked like it was from another planet. I took it out and inspected it. I instantly had a feeling of unease, like I shouldn't have picked it up. I immediately put it back in its original place.

Suddenly, I heard a shuffle. I was instantly on my guard. “Oh well, it was probably just the wind,” I thought. Or was it…?

That night, when I was in the bathroom, I felt like there was someone behind the shower curtains. I felt uneasy. However, I found no one (as expected). I laughed it off.

Something similar happened to me when I was trying to sleep (I have insomnia). I felt like there was someone standing right next to me, watching me. I got up into a sitting position with a jerk, looking around in fear. This time, I saw a shadow. I was seriously creeped out, but I passed that off as an illusion and drifted off to sleep slowly.

Today, as I was browsing the city, I always felt like there was someone following me, someone that wanted to harm me. Someone whose intentions were malicious. Someone who wanted to kill me. It was seriously unsettling. I wanted to get to the bottom of this and I immediately turned around when I had that feeling of being followed, but I yielded no results.

As I was having dinner back at the hotel, I had the feeling that someone was behind me again. This time, however, I feel like that person was HOLDING SOMETHING. I turned around and saw the exact same shadow I saw last night, except I saw it for a whole second. I shouted loudly, “Who are you? What do you want? Why the fuck are you following me? I’m seriously creeped out dude, fuck off.” No response. I was starting to question my sanity.

And right now, as I’m typing this, I feel it again. Someone’s behind me, and this time I’m certain. It’s getting on my nerves. I'm literally going to shit myself. This person is approaching me slowly, like a predator who is about to catch its prey. Is "he" even a person? I’m seriously scared. I can feel that something’s pointed right at me. Probably a gun. It’s getting closer. I am about to have a mental breakdown and cry. I want to scream out loud. I want to call for help, but I know it’s useless. No one is going to be able to help me. It’s too late for that. It’s way too late. I can feel the gun getting pressed painfully upon my neck.

I’m going to die.
