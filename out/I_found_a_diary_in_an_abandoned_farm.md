*This is now my third logbook. It helps me to come to terms with the overall situation. That's why I'm doing this. Maybe I should keep my space free for something more important, but as long as I still have room, I won't risk losing the thing that keeps me from losing my mind. Being able to record my thoughts is a great help to my mental health. Similar to a diary, which brings us to the topic at hand.*



*Ever since the parasite started rampaging through the cities, turning people into cannibalistic monsters under its control, I've stayed away from cities. I focus on looting individual buildings outside the city for supplies. So far I've been able to keep my head above water, even though I've been encountering more parasites recently.*



*Be that as it may. I've broken into a farmhouse. I found two infected people there. I released them both from their torment. I then searched the house for all kinds of supplies. I found this diary from a Mrs Oshnikov. I found the contents very interesting and I'll just read them out. Please note that I skipped some pages with irrelevant information.*



Day: 65



‘These are terrible times, honestly. My father took my sister and drove her to the city to get medical treatment. I stayed here to look after the rest of my family. I want to make sure they're okay. I also taught myself how to shoot a gun. I hope I never have to use those skills, but I'm afraid it's already too late for that.’



Day: 72



‘When I was getting some firewood today, I saw a person in the forest. He was making abnormal noises. This person was infected. For the first time, I saw the parasite take over a person with my own eyes. It doesn't seem to be controlling the host. It seems more like it is using it as an empty protective shell. Parts of his skull were no longer there. Only tentacle-like outgrowths on his head, hands and a few other parts of his body. A sight you won't forget in a hurry. When he noticed me, I shot him in the head. That seemed to be enough to kill him. As you can see, my shooting training paid off.’



Day: 98



‘Our livestock was infected. We had to get rid of all of them. One by one we had to kill them. At least I got to see the infection in its infancy through to complete takeover with my own eyes. Even if I would have liked to have spared myself the sight. They keep talking on the radio about how we should all stay calm. But you don't have to be a doctor to realise that they're lying to us and trying to hide what's really happening. But maybe they don't know any better themselves. The way the parasite is developing, it doesn't seem inconceivable.’



Day: 140



‘My family was infected while I was foraging for supplies in the woods. I try to help them, but when I think that there seems to be no immunity, my hopes are slim. If there's no way around it, I'll redeem them. I won't let them turn into those things.’



Day: 147



‘I am devastated. All of them died. In this house. I don't know what to do. The parasite reached their brains and from then on I had no choice but to kill them. I buried them. I know I have to be strong. But it would be bad enough to lose just one family member. And I've lost them all. So I don't mind my tears. My mother, my father, my sister, my grandmother. They are all dead. How can I go on living after all this? What sense do I have to go on living?’



Day: 177



‘I really struggled with whether to take my own life. After all, I'm alone now. I don't have anyone else. There are no instructions from the government either. They're probably all dead by now or they're hiding somewhere and leaving their people to die. I have decided to give my life meaning. I want to find a cure for this parasite. Which sounds ridiculous, especially since the last emergency centre in Moscow closed down a few weeks ago. So I don't even have a clue where to start. Maybe I should go there to get some information to work with. The doctors will certainly not have stood idly by and documented a few things.’



Day: 189



The emergency centre in Moscow was empty and everything was quiet. Apart from the distant cries of infected people and the wind, you couldn't really hear anything. There was no sign of life in the city. Moscow was dead. Walking through there gave me a very unsettling feeling. In the lab, I encountered a few parasites, which I successfully evaded. I took everything I could find and went back home. With a few samples of the parasite that I took from my family's bodies and the information from the books, I decided to start my experiments. I know it's macabre to dig up the rotting bodies of your own family for something like this but I'm in a very desperate situation. Whoever is reading this other than me, please bear with me.



Day: 201



‘I was able to gain some valuable information about the parasites. They seem to be very intent on involving other living beings in their biological processes. It makes no difference to them whether they are humans or animals. If they are not able to bind humans or animals, the parasites seem to combine into biomass, which in turn acts as a breeding ground for new parasites. This is obviously how they multiply. I have already seen a lot of such biomass in Moscow and in isolated areas of the country. It is moving more and more towards nature and is also infecting wildlife. Sometimes the parasites have even made infected people part of it. I guess it makes sense biologically. I was also able to find out how my family got infected. Apparently the groundwater was contaminated and both my family and our animals drank it. I was already focussing on using canned food because I was worried that something like this could happen.’



Day: 230



‘I'm going to leave this diary here so that anyone who gets lost here will find it and hopefully read it. I'm away at the moment to get a few things. Take whatever you need from the house but please do NOT go to the basement. Your wellbeing and maybe even the wellbeing of humanity depends on it. I was so naive. For God's sake. I felt like I was on the verge of a breakthrough and I didn't stop. And I created something. The cellar door is sealed and it has to stay that way. Otherwise, there's nothing to stop this thing from wiping out all life on the planet. Unless I die trying, I will try to return soon with something that can put an end to it. I'll be back soon.’



*This was also the last diary entry. She has apparently not returned since. Judging by all the dust on the diary, she is probably already dead. I'm curious to find out what that is down there. But I don't think I need to go down to the cellar to find out. As if that thing down there in the cellar already knew I was there reading this. I can hear it banging on the doors and trying to spread out in the small room. It makes the whole house shake and lets out the most terrifying bestial roar I've ever heard. If it breaks free, may God protect me and humanity.*
