Part I: https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1he965z/the_stranger/

I’ve never been superstitious, and I, technically speaking, still had no reason to be. If you’ve read my last post, you could be thinking the same thing. There’s nothing in there that I’ve described that could not have some sort of rational, mundane explanation. The odd handprints could possibly be from some harmless prankster. The cats could’ve gotten spooked because cats just get spooked by nothing sometimes. The gust of wind I felt could’ve just been a gust of wind on an otherwise calm night. Even the voices could’ve come from some asshole that missed their calling as a voice actor or ventriloquist. The could’ve heard my wife and I talk before and just figured out how to mimic us. I really wish I could believe all that. I really do. But RocksAnn and I have an awful gut feeling that most, if not all, of the recent shenanigans and goings on are part of one real life paranormal horror show. And the show must go on.

After that night, we stopped seeing the handprints on our vehicles and windows. We started seeing them around the house instead. On countertops, the walls, the tv, the couch, the fridge even. We also started finding bare footprints. Our guest was feeling free to make themselves at home, it seems. And our cats; they all started behaving differently. Rorschach, our kitten, became increasingly skittish. Normally, he hated being in his cage, which was where we fed him. He was always crying and nagging to get out as soon as he finished eating. Now he was reluctant to come out, and when he did he preferred to stay under the couch. Häagen-Dazs behaved similarly, but with more aggression. Often she would stare and hiss and something that wasn’t there, or at least nothing I could see, she would calm down after that but still stare in the same direction. Tarrare, though, seemed relatively undisturbed, her only thing being that she seemed to run around more, and was just a little more frantic. She was always the more, well, simple of our cats, happy as long as she got her meals on time.

My wife and I were both in sorry states. For one thing, our house was freezing now. No matter how high we put the heater, we felt like we were in Alaska, despite living near the border of Mexico. There was a heaviness to the house now. It felt like our souls stayed at the door and we were husks inside our home. We spent a lot of our time outside, going for long walks, sometimes til our feet burned. We didn’t like being in the house. We didn’t like our cats being there either, so until we could figure out our situation, we took the cats to my in-laws. It was a chore explaining why we needed them to pet sit when we weren’t going anywhere. After hearing about the handprints and the cold and all the rest, they thought our house was demon infested. Wasn’t surprised to hear it from them. They were very religious to the point they were at times reluctant to purchase secondhand items out of paranoia about whether or not they would unwittingly buy something demon-possessed.

“By now the whole house must be infested,” said Rosa, RocksAnns mother. “Only thing you can really do now is move out and let it have your house. You don’t want it to have your souls.”

“It isn’t that simple,” RocksAnn said. “We moved here because we can’t afford to go anywhere else right now. It could be years before we’re able to make any kind of move.”

“And besides,” I put in. “We don’t know for sure what exactly it even is. How do you know it’s a demon and not something else? Maybe it’s something we can’t understand.”

“Whatever you think it might or might not be,” Rosa rebuffed, “Do you really think it has good intentions towards y’all?”

It was hard to argue with that. It felt like we were being toyed with in our own house. That feeling wasn’t made any better the next morning when I walked into the kitchen. As I grabbed a mug to make coffee, I found something new on the counter. Dirt, but not a handprint. It was an arrow. It pointed to the kitchen window, and toward the cemetery. I heard a shatter. When I looked at the floor, I only then realized that, in my shock, I had let my mug slip from my hand. If that arrow didn’t signify malevolent intent, I don’t know what did. Either our stranger wanted to kill us, or he wanted us to finish the job ourselves. I showed my wife what I saw, and we could only sit in stunned silence. My wife was in a numb state. She was staring blankly out the window. I was the opposite. Anxious and fidgety, I almost jumped out of my skin every time I heard the smallest sound. I would’ve been shivering even if I wasn’t freezing cold. Finally RocksAnn spoke.

“What are we going to do about this?” It wasn’t the first time either of us asked that question, but we needed a final answer, an answer I didn’t have.

“I don’t know. Even if we try to move, we’re gonna have to be in and out of the house for a while.”

“All the more reason to start moving now,” she urged. “How long can we stay before we’re driven insane?”

“I know,” I sipped my coffee. Everything tasted more and more the same each day. Murky. “I wish we didn’t have to spend one more day here. Or night.”

“It’s better than being here forever,” she was still staring out the window. Finally she looked at me. “My parents are offering to let us stay in their trailer until we can find a new place. It won’t be ready until tomorrow, so we’ll have to make do with one more night here, unless we can afford a motel.”

We could barely afford two days of groceries right now much less a motel. “One more night it is,” I replied.

We tried to spend most of our time out of the house. We walked at the park, went by the thrift store, went by the post office, anything to keep us out of the house. Eventually though, we had to go back home. We actually fell asleep a little more easily that night. Maybe knowing that we would soon leave this nightmare behind set our tired minds at ease.

Sometime in the middle of the night, my slumber was rudely interrupted. I awoke in a sneezing fit. It wasn’t really surprising, I had allergies off and on. I went to the kitchen for tissues. When I touched my face though, my shivers from the past days melted away in a white hot rage, though I was still scared to the bone. I felt dirt on my face. I’d had enough.

“Get out of our damn house!” I shrieked at the top of my lungs. I heard my wife run to the bedroom door before I finished my sentence. “Get out! Get out now! Leave us the fuck alone! I swear I’ll burn this house down with you in it!”

“What happened?!”, my wife asked.

I grabbed her hand and placed it on my face.

“Oh my god,” was all she could say.

“This thing stole our home. It’s stealing our life away.”

“We won’t let it take anymore,” she assured me as she held me close. After I calmed down I noticed something.

“RocksAnn, do you feel something?” I asked.

She looked at me with a nervous look on her face. “No?”

“Exactly. The cold is gone.” Her eyes lit up once she realized.

“You don’t think-“ she began.

“That we’re safe now?”, I finished. “Too early to tell. I guess we’ll see over the next few days maybe.”

We spent the next several days in the house. Miraculously, everything seemed back to normal. The chill was gone. We didn’t find any handprints or footprints or anything inside or outside. Most importantly, we felt alive again. Actually alive in our own home. We couldn’t figure out why though. Why was one show of outrage enough to banish the stranger? As it turns out I’d get more answers than I hoped for.

One afternoon, while I was washing dishes, I found myself gazing out the window and towards the cemetery. It still looked quiet and peaceful despite everything. My musings were interrupted by a familiar sounds. The same pawing I heard the night I let the stranger into our house. It was slower this time. My heart dropped at the noise. I couldn’t stomach the thought of going through all this again. No way I was going to let it in again. I heard something else though. My wife’s voice, not talking, but sobbing. Then they sobbed in my voice, then in both of ours. Another cruel joke to toy with us. RocksAnn, who’d been in the living room, was by my side now. We listened to the pawing and the crying. What if it didn’t stop? Or what if it came back again and again? While it cried, it spoke in our voices.

“I-I-I’m…s-s-sor-sor-ry,” it groaned. “D-Did not-t wan-nt…hurt-t. On-nly w-want h-hel-p. Pl-ease. I’m…so…c-cold.”

RocksAnn and I looked at each other. We were taken aback by how they spoke, not that they used our voices, but how they used them. They sounded absolutely pained. And that last thing they said. Were they really living such a miserable existence?

“P-please!”, they started again, “F-find g-grave. Dig.” The sobbing faded, and so did the cold chill by the door. My wife and I talked throughout the rest of the day about our experience. We went back and forth over whether this was some kind of trick, or our stranger really did need help. Even if they were sincere, what could we do? Obviously they wanted us to find and dig up a grave, what for, we couldn’t say. We eventually decided it couldn’t hurt to drop by the cemetery. So that’s what we did the following morning. We took a walk through the cemetery, not knowing what we were looking for. We combed over every tomstone, hoping our stranger might’ve left some kind of sign. Our search paid off after maybe an hour or so of looking. One tombstone I can’t remember who it belonged to, it had a dirt arrow on it, pointing to its right. We followed the aisle of stones further, until we came to a small plot with a dirt handprint on its stone. It had one name on it: Stan. There was no year of birth, nor any statement about the person or his life. Their year of death was 1893. RocksAnn and I felt the chill return for a brief, silent moment, then it was gone again.

After another lengthy discussion that afternoon, my wife and I came to a decision. We were going to help this stranger, Stan. We didn’t like the thought of defiling a grave. But if we didn’t, Stan might never be done with us, and whoever he was, we didn’t want anyone to be doomed to an eternal lonely cold. That night, we took a shovel and found Stan’s grave. RocksAnn held the flashlight while I started digging. It was a cold night, but not freezing. I guess Stan decided it best not to disturb us. It didn’t take long until I hit an old and worn wooden coffin. After clearing away the dirt I pried it open with the shovel. What we saw inside will haunt us more than anything else that happened prior. The body was so small. It couldn’t have been more than ten years old at the time of death. This stranger, this kid, had been wandering cold and alone for well over a century. Had he ever tried to ask anyone else for help? If he did, it hadn’t worked until now.

What did he need now? We dug up his grave. Was there more we had to do? We decided to look in his tattered pockets for anything to clue us in. To my surprise, I did find something. RocksAnn shined a light on the small stub of paper I’d pulled out. It was a train ticket. This poor kid must’ve been wanting to go home, and never made it back in life. We weren’t sure if this was what he wanted now, but we couldn’t figure what else it could be. So we covered his grave, and booked it to the old dilapidated train station. It was currently being reconstructed, and passenger trains never stopped here. We didn’t know what we expected to happen, but we stepped onto the platform with the ticket and waited. Before ten minutes had passed, a mist set in and covered the ground. It rose to our knees, and in the dark, the platform and track were completely invisible to our eyes. Then we heard the blaring of a train horn. No, not a horn. It was the howl of a steam whistle, coming from our left. The sound of it rumbling along the tracks filled the air and grew louder with each passing second. That was when he finally approached. Stan’s cold chill filled the air once more, but it was different now. The cold wasn’t so oppressive now. It felt lighter, more endurable. I hoped it was for Stan too.

We never saw the train. We didn’t see it stop at the platform, though we heard it slow until its wheels screeched to a halt. We didn’t see Stan step aboard a passenger car, though the chill of his presence vanished, and the ticket in my hand whisked away in a sharp breeze. We didn’t see the old locomotive begin its departure, though we heard the cry of its whistle which then echoed through the cold desert night, and felt the smoke from the engines smokestack in our lungs. We didn’t see the train vanish into the night, though the galloping of the engine and its cars slowly fades into the distance. We saw nothing on that platform but a mist that came and went. We saw nothing, but RocksAnn and I both knew it was over. I hoped our stranger made it home safely.
