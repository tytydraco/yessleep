I never wanted to move back into my childhood home.

It wasn’t just the bad memories—there was something off about the house itself. My mom used to say it was just old and creaky, but I remember the way the shadows never seemed to fall right. How certain rooms always felt colder, no matter how high we turned up the heat. And then there was the scratching noise in the walls.

“Probably mice,” my mom used to say.

But mice don’t laugh.

When my mom passed away last year, I had no choice but to come back. It was cheaper than renting, and I thought maybe, as an adult, the house wouldn’t scare me anymore.

I was wrong.

The first night back, I barely slept.

The house was so quiet I could hear every groan of the wood, every whisper of wind sneaking through the gaps in the windows. I kept telling myself it was just my imagination, that nothing had changed in the house since I’d been a kid.

But then, at around 2 a.m., I heard the scratching.

It started faintly, like fingernails running along the inside of the walls. Then it grew louder, more frantic.

I sat up in bed, my heart pounding. “Just mice,” I whispered to myself, repeating it like a prayer.

The scratching stopped.

I let out a shaky breath and was just starting to relax when I heard the laugh.

It was faint, barely audible, but I know what I heard. A low, wheezing chuckle that made my stomach twist into knots.

I didn’t sleep at all after that.

For the next week, the noises got worse.

The scratching grew louder and more constant. Sometimes I’d hear the laugh again, soft and raspy, always coming from the walls. I tried telling myself it was just the house settling, but deep down, I knew that wasn’t true.

One night, I got brave enough to investigate. I followed the sound of the scratching to the living room, pressing my ear against the wall.

I could hear breathing.

By the end of the second week, I was losing it.

Every time I closed my eyes, I felt like I was being watched. I started hearing faint whispers, too low to make out, but just loud enough to keep me awake.

I decided to rip open the walls.

It wasn’t easy. The house was old, and the plaster crumbled as I hacked at it with a crowbar. I made a mess, but I didn’t care. I just wanted to prove to myself that there was nothing there.

But I found something.

Inside the wall, hidden between the wooden beams, was a tiny opening. A crawlspace.

The crawlspace was barely big enough for a person, but there was stuff inside. Old blankets, a rusted flashlight, wrappers from snacks I didn’t recognize.

Someone had been living there.

I felt sick as I reached for the flashlight. I didn’t want to shine it inside, but I couldn’t stop myself.

The light illuminated a small figure crouched in the back corner.

It was a man.

He was pale and thin, his clothes tattered and dirty. His head tilted at an odd angle as he stared at me with wide, unblinking eyes. His lips stretched into a smile that was far too wide for his face.

And then he laughed.

The same low, wheezing chuckle I’d been hearing for weeks.

I screamed, stumbling backward, but when I looked again, the crawlspace was empty.

I boarded up the wall that night.

I told myself it was over, that whoever—or whatever—I’d seen was gone. But deep down, I knew better.

Now, every night, I hear him.

The scratching. The laughter.

And when I wake up, I see him standing at the foot of my bed, his too-wide smile glowing in the darkness.
