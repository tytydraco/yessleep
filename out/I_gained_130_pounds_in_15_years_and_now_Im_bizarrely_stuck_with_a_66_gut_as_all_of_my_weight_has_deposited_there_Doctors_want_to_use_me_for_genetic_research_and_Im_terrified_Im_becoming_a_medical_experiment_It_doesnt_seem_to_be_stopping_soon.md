I never thought I’d be writing this, especially here, since this is a true-to-life story (and feel free to AMA), but after what’s happened to my body in the past year and a half, it feels like I’m living in someone else’s skin—no, someone else’s nightmare. I’m 31 years old, and in just 1.5 years, I’ve gained over 130 pounds. What’s terrifying is that almost all of this weight has gone straight to my belly—like, nowhere else. It’s as if my gut has developed a mind of its own, expanding beyond reason. Now I’m sitting here with a round belly that measures 66 inches around. If you saw me, you’d think I was overdue with triplets.

It all started after I moved cross-country for a new job—one where I’m sitting at a desk for hours on end. My lifestyle changed; I wasn’t moving around as much anymore. I knew my diet wasn’t great, either, but nothing could’ve prepared me for the way my body started to change. At first, I noticed some weight gain, but it wasn’t normal. I remember waking up one morning, and my gut had visibly expanded overnight. It wasn’t just a little bloating. I could feel my skin stretching, like someone was blowing me up from the inside.

I thought it was some sort of fluke. But every day, my belly grew bigger. It wasn’t gradual—it was like someone was inflating me with a pump. I would wake up and my gut would be bigger than the night before. Soon, none of my clothes fit. My shirts started riding up, exposing the underbelly I desperately tried to keep covered, but my stomach had become this growing, uncontrollable mass. Every time I thought it might stop, it would just swell again, and soon, I was outgrowing clothes faster than I could buy them.

I’m required to wear a uniform at work—a button-up shirt—and every morning, squeezing into that shirt became a nightmare. The buttons pulled so tight I thought they’d pop off. In fact, they did pop more than a few times, right in front of my coworkers. Imagine the humiliation. My belly was pressing into my desk, making it impossible to sit comfortably. I had to sit far away from it, like I needed extra space just to accommodate the globe that was forming around my waist. Getting in and out of my car? Forget it. I had to struggle just to wedge myself behind the wheel.

The worst part is the doctors don’t know what’s happening to me. I’ve been to countless specialists—endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, dietitians—you name it. They’ve tested me for everything: Cushing’s syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance. You name it, they checked it. But every test came back negative. And now, I’m starting to think they’re not interested in helping me anymore.

I can see it in their eyes. I’m no longer a patient to them; I’m a case study. They keep talking about me as if I’m some kind of medical anomaly, a walking experiment. One doctor even told me they’d “never seen a belly like this before,” and another made a joke, saying I looked like I was “overdue with triplets.” They don’t see me as a person—they see me as an object of fascination.

And then came the suggestion that terrified me: experimental treatments. One of my specialists hinted that my case is so severe they want to spearhead genetic research, using me as a test subject. I can’t tell if they’re more interested in helping me, or in seeing how far my body will go. It’s horrifying, because I can’t stop this—no matter what I do, the weight just keeps piling on. I can feel my body stretching, swelling, and I’m powerless to stop it.

My life has completely changed. I can’t even tie my shoes without getting out of breath because my gut is pressing into my legs. Sitting up in bed has become impossible—I have to roll out of bed every morning. Even sitting down at a restaurant is humiliating; I can barely fit into booths because my belly presses against the table so hard, I have to sit uncomfortably hunched over. I’m no longer living in my own body—my body is living its own life, and I’m trapped inside of it.

And the stares. People treat me completely differently now. Strangers on the street stop and gawk at me like I’m some kind of sideshow freak. They point at me and ask when I’m due. One guy actually shouted, “Damn, when are the triplets due?” as I was struggling to get up from a bench. I tried to laugh it off, but inside, I was horrified.

My town even ran a story about me in the local paper, like I was some kind of medical mystery. They filmed me walking down the street, measuring my belly on camera as if I were some kind of specimen. I’ve had kids ask their parents if I’m pregnant. It’s dehumanizing, and yet, every day I wake up and I feel my belly stretching further, like it’s not finished growing.

Then, there’s the worst part. The weight gain has completely thrown my hormones out of whack. I’ve been experiencing extreme fatigue, mood swings, and worst of all, an embarrassing level of arousal. Every time someone stares at me or comments on my size, it triggers something in me, something I can’t control. It’s like my body wants to be humiliated. The doctors noticed, too. They’ve started asking me about the “psychological effects” of my condition, and I’m too mortified to tell them the truth.

I recently had to visit my family for a reunion, and it was a disaster. They hadn’t seen me since before the weight gain. The looks on their faces—shock, dismay, disgust. I could barely fit into the airplane seat on the way there. When I arrived, my aunt whispered, “Are you sure you’re okay?” as if I had turned into something else, something monstrous. The whole trip was a nightmare. I was wedged into seats, struggling to move, humiliated by my own body.

And despite all of this, I still don’t have any answers. The doctors are now talking about taking even more drastic measures—testing me, studying me, seeing how far my body can stretch. I don’t feel like a patient anymore. I feel like I’m part of an experiment I never signed up for. I don’t know where this is going to end, but I’m starting to fear that I might not have any control over it anymore.
