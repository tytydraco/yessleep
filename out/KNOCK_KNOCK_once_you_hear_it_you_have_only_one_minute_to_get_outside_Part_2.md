The next morning, I hop the stadium fence. Now I *really* need to clear my head.

I lazily tie my running shoes. Been working at half-speed this morning. A sleepless night will do that to you. But then again, how can you fall asleep when every creak jolts you awake?

I stretch out my Achilles. Still tender, but they say a full recovery can take up to 24 months. It was easy to recover from the ACL in high school, but an Achilles tear in your thirties hits differently. I hit start on my watch and try to work up to a sprint. I ain’t setting any records today.

Before I leave, I run into Ryan Rubino again. You can spot a guy wearing a visor a mile away. We chat for a bit longer this time. The distraction feels nice. He asks me if I want to get dinner with him. That would break all my rules of wanting to keep things casual. But then again, he knew me back when I was a rule-breaker… so I smile and say yes.

I get in my car and drive to work. I’d rather pay 45 bucks for parking than get clawed at by another crazy person. Or worse, be the crazy person clawing at someone.

Before I get to my desk, I stop by my supervisor’s desk and ask if I can work from home. He looks at me like I just requested to take his corner office suite. He then lectures me on the importance of having a collaborative work environment. I thank him for the TED Talk and leave.

I don’t spend a minute at my desk actually working. Not when you have Reddit to devour to try to find out what the fuck is happening to you. After endlessly scrolling through random subreddits, I find a couple of cryptic posts mentioning something similar happening—

*IF YOU HEAR IT, RUN! YOU ONLY HAVE ONE MINUTE…* Check.

*THE LONGER YOU WAIT THE MORE INTENSE IT GETS…* Check.

*EACH PASSING DAY GETS WORSE. IT STARTS TO REVEAL ITSELF…* Lovely.

I message each of the users. It’s not until a couple hours pass that I realize that none of the accounts have been active in weeks. WEEKS!

Call it a curse, hex, spell, voodoo bullshit, whatever you want. I just know that I can’t let it win. I can’t let it dictate *my* life. That’s when I come up with a game plan.

Unfortunately, I work on the 18th floor of a skyscraper. So, if the knocking happens at work then my odds of getting outside in time are slim. But maybe not impossible.

I look down at my watch and hit start. I quickly run past a row of cubicles and head straight for the staircase exit.

I sprint down 18 flights in a flurry. Descending down with rapid strides. My feet pound against the concrete. I push the side door open….  1 minute and 35 seconds. FUCK!!

Stairs won’t work. I get back to my desk and chug some water. Let’s try option #2. ..

Once again, I hit start on my watch and sprint past the cubicles. My coworkers probably think I’m crazy. I slam the “down” button at the elevator bay. DING! It arrives within 10 seconds.

I press for the lobby and then repeatedly smash the “close” button. The elevator descends down. Nobody’s joined me so far. Count that as a win. I check my watch. Good timing. DING! The doors open and I sprint through the lobby and exit through the front…

56.86 seconds. Not a lot of room for error.

I consider this an eventful day at work and pack my things. Leaving a little early has never hurt anyone. Especially if it means you don’t die a miserable death in front of your coworkers.

I don’t typically do two-a-days, not since high school at least, but I don’t have any other option. I hop the fence. It’s time to train harder. Get faster. Stronger. I may not know how to stop this curse, but I can definitely outrun it.

I dig my shoes into the turf and press start. I finish the first lap in under 56 seconds. Jesus, I haven’t ran that fast since college.

I take a short break and go again. I’m not just determined anymore. No, I’m mad. Pissed. And let me tell you, when you run with rage, you can really fucking fly…

I break 55 seconds. I give myself another short break and then line up again. I dig my shoes into the turf and press start…

My adrenaline takes over. I’m on pace to break 53 seconds. I round the turn and—

*POP!* I tumble to the ground, grabbing my leg. Please, not my Achilles. Not again.

I try to walk it off but I can barely put weight on my foot.

I just pray it’s a minor strain.

\*\*\*

I attempt to fall asleep, but the biting cold makes it nearly impossible. Yet, the sad reality is, there's no chance of me catching any sleep tonight. For the second consecutive night, the freezing temperatures and the anxiety of the knocking hold me captive. In moments like these, I wish Alexis was still here. She was the only person who could calm me down.

I grab my laptop and log into Facebook. Jesus, the suburbs have changed me. I try to remember my login information but it’s been years since I’ve used it. After a few attempts, I log in and browse through photos of Alexis and me. A collage of drunk memories.

I reach into my pocket and take out the lighter. I juggle it between my fingers as I click through the photos. If I linger too long on any particular photo I begin to cry. I keep clicking, basking in the nostalgia. But then— I jolt backward... There's something in the background of one of the photos.

That demon-like figure. The same one that stood behind me in the kitchen. I rub my eyes and try to look closer but… the figure is gone. Fuck. I really need to get some sleep.

I toss and turn in bed. I look outside and realize I only have one option…

I open my closet and take out a bunch of clothes: thermal long johns, fleece sweater, wool leggings, snow jacket and pants.

I become a Russian doll of warmth.

I grab every blanket I have and bring it to the deck outside.

Nothing like camping in your backyard in the dead of winter.

At least I can close my eyes.

\*\*\*

Two days have passed and my leg still doesn’t feel better. I’ve pushed off getting an MRI. Being locked into a machine for 45 minutes feels like it’s tempting fate. The alternative is that my leg doesn’t get better and then I’m really tempting fate. That’s when I make my decision.

Injected with gadolinium, I'm instructed to remain motionless. They give me a button to use for communication. I look at the doctor and ask “What happens if I hear a loud noise?” The doctor calmly responds, "That's to be expected. It's why you have the headphones." Ah, yes. It’s cute that you think headphones will drown out the satanic knocking noise.

They strap me onto a table. “Claustrophobia is normal. Just try to stay still.” I simply nod back at them. Claustrophobia is normal. Getting assaulted by some demonic entity isn’t.

The table begins its slow journey toward the machine. I close my eyes. My finger hovers over the button. Ready to push it at a moment’s notice. I know that I can leave this room, dart down the hallway, and get to the back exit in about 45 seconds. I calculated it while waiting in the lobby.

The machine powers on. It creates a cacophony of loud thuds and whirs. I open my eyes. That was a mistake. Sweat drips down. I begin to breathe rapidly. Fuck, am I staying still enough? My heart races, doubts creep in. The thuds intensify, echoing louder.

And then I hear—

A KNOCK. Or so I think. The line between reality and illusion blurs, and I lose focus. Disorientation takes hold, and before I know it, my eyes close, and my body goes limp.

And then, consciousness slips away.

\*\*\*

I open my eyes to find a group of nurses hovering above me. Guess I’m not dead. They check on me and tell me that I passed out. None of the doctors realized it until the scan was over.

A sense of relief passes over me. I collect my things and get out of there as fast as I can.

As the day goes on my leg begins to feel better. Maybe the rest is working. I’ll know more next week.  I stumble into work, late once again. If I wasn't a consultant I would have been fired days ago. I know that because everyone else here gives me a jealous glare.

I take a seat at my desk and finally get to work. I just need two, maybe three uninterrupted hours.

I open my marketing deck and start making tweaks. And then… a SHADOW APPEARS.

My head snaps to the window, revealing a man wielding a bright yellow squeegee— phew, just the window washing crew.

After doing the minimum amount of work to justify my hourly rate, I log back into Reddit. I still haven’t received any messages back. They must all be on a tropical vacation, enjoying themselves after successfully beating this curse. That’s the only rational explanation, right?

I think about what other research I can do. I tap my pen on my desk, thinking.

*Tap tap.*

My eyes widen. That wasn’t me. Oh, fuck…

I start my watch and leap out of my desk. I sprint directly to the elevators, dodging anyone in my way. I’ve been preparing for this moment all week.

I repeatedly hit the call button. I look down at my watch, only 12 seconds have lapsed.

*TAP… TAP…*

I try to ignore the sound. My foot anxiously shakes. The elevator is taking forever.

*KNOCK. KNOCK.*

My eyes dart in whatever direction I hear the noise. Up, down. Left, right. I can’t stop following it. The knocking gets louder. My eyes dart rapidly. I can’t control my head anymore.

*KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.*

All of a sudden… Everything turns upside down. I can’t find the elevator button. Doesn’t matter, I don’t have time anymore. I look around, still disoriented…

I see a sign…

**⊥IXƎ**

Shit. That’s the staircase. Not enough time for that either. I need to find another way to get out.

I steady my breathing. I need to focus. Get back to seeing straight.

C’mon Delaney. You’ve got this. You’ve fucking GOT THIS.

*KNOCK… KNOCK... KNOCK… KNOCK…*

Now focused, I see that my coworkers are staring at me. I look at my watch, I only have 30 seconds left. And I’m stuck on the 18th fucking floor.

My head whips around. Searching for an exit. And then I realize there’s only one way to escape.

***KNOCK… KNOCK... KNOCK… KNOCK…***

Computer monitors fly at me. I dodge them, having no idea if they are real or not. The lights from above come crashing down. I keep going, ignoring everything.

I go into the break room and grab a metal chair. Only 20 seconds left.  I rush to the window and—

*BANG!!!*  I throw the chair against the window.

I start to see the shadowy figure. It stares directly at me. FUCK YOU.

*BANG!!!*

The window cracks. My coworkers try to stop me but I fight them off. Only 10 seconds left. I let out a primal scream and fling the chair again…

*BANG!!!*

The window starts to shatter. **5 seconds**. I see the figure clearer. Red pulsating eyes. **3 seconds**. It taunts me. I use all my strength and launch the chair one final time at the window…

*BANG!!!*

The window shatters and I leap out. Free-falling as my watch hits 60 seconds.

I open my arms, bracing for impact.

*BAM!*

I land onto the scaffolding two stories below. Thank god it was window washing day.

I hoist myself onto the platform next to the window washing guy. He blinks wildly at me. I catch my breath. My coworkers hover over the edge of the broken window, aghast.

I exhale a sigh of relief. I look up and request someone to grab my things.

I don’t think I’ll be going to work tomorrow.

\*\*\*

A waiter leads us to the table closest to the front, as per my request, of course.

Ryan pulls my chair out for me. Didn’t expect such chivalrous behavior from a visor-wearing gym teacher. Tonight he looks cleaned up though.

After the tumultuous day I had, including launching myself out of an office building, I decided to text Ryan. I crave a distraction and, who knows, he might have information about the student who bolted out of the classroom.

My gaze drifts down to the menu. I don’t normally do dinner dates. What do I get?

“You've been here before, right?” Ryan attempts some small talk. “Never,” I reply.

“Wait. Seriously? Best pasta in Cook County. Especially to carb load.”

“Oh, I didn’t realize we had a track meet tomorrow?” I playfully grin back.

Ryan laughs. “Don’t you miss those days?”

“That I could eat a plate full of pasta and still look like a twig?”

“All of it,” Ryan says with a nostalgic smile. “I just miss all of it.”

We continue to reminisce about high school. The pranks we pulled. The parties we attended. The people. Wondering where everyone ended up. It's only when Ryan briefly leaves for the bathroom that I realize, for the first time in years, I'm not instinctively looking for an exit on a date. More importantly, it's the first time in days that I haven't thought about the knocking.

Upon his return, and after some playful banter, Ryan broaches the topic of "hopping the fence." I attempt to change the subject, but he persists. “Is it because of Alexis?” he asks.

Shit.

He wants to get serious.

I look up at him and nod, trying to fight back tears. Discussing Alexis feels like navigating an emotional minefield. Even my parents knew better than to bring her up.

But I can't lie to him.

With a somber exhale, I open my mouth, ready to talk…

\*\*\*

It was the winter of 2007, our senior year.

Alexis, in her cardinal red Stanford sweatshirt, and I, sporting my blue and gold UCLA gear, had committed to our respective schools out west, both getting a full-ride. We were ready to get out of this bubble. Out of Illinois. Out of the cold.

Courtney Miller’s parents were in the city for a Bulls game so she decided to have a bunch of people over. Play some beer pong. Flip cup. You know, practice for college.

Alexis wasn’t drinking that night. Still nursing a hangover from the night before.

We were all laughing, drinking, smoking. Living our best lives until I received a buzzkill of a text—my mom was having a seizure, and I needed to rush home.

I stumbled out the door, keys in hand, navigating through thick, slushy snow. Just as I was about to drive away, a knock on my car window startled me. It was Alexis.

“The fuck are you doing?”

“Going home.”

“You’re drunk!”

“I’m good. I’m fine. I promise,” I stammered.

Alexis gave me a look. “Give me the keys. I’ll drive.”

Rolling my eyes, I handed her the keys. The car skidded as Alexis peeled out, knowing I was due for new tires. "You're an idiot," she smiled.

“I know.”

We blasted music and chatted, reminiscing about our senior year, the parties, and the people. Alexis reached into her pocket and handed me a disposable lighter. "Here. Keep this," she said. "Light it whenever you're feeling alone, and it'll be like I am right there with you."

A cheap disposable lighter suddenly meant the world to me. I pocketed it and thanked her with a smile. Our conversation shifted to Courtney, and I encouraged Alexis to make a move, but she confessed to still figuring things out, nervous about her first kiss.

I told Alexis there was nothing to be nervous about. She said girls are different. We turned to each other and laughed—

*BERRRRRRR BERRRRRRRRRR.*

Suddenly, our laughter was interrupted by a blaring horn. A big rig approached, prompting Alexis to swerve, sending the car skidding off the road.

*BANG!*

The next thing I know, I found myself hanging upside down. Slowly opening my eyes—

*KNOCK KNOCK.*

A sharp knocking sound on the glass. I turned to see Alexis attempting to break it to escape. Bloodied fists pounded against the driver side window, a piece of wood puncturing her chest.

The car was upside down, on the side of the road, smashed into a fallen tree.

*KNOCK KNOCK.*

Alexis kept pounding, her efforts growing weaker. Broken glass surrounded me as I struggled to unbuckle my seatbelt—

My knee twisted, pain coursing through me as I crawled out through the shattered window—

*KNOCK KNOCK.*

I heard her knocking, desperate and faint. Yelling for her to keep breathing, I limped towards her side. The knocking turned into a light tapping sound as I reached out to save her.

But it was too late.

No more knocking. No more tapping. I just saw Alexis’s lifeless body.

\*\*\*

“So, who wants dessert?” the waitress interrupts with a giant smile. Talk about terrible timing.

Ryan shakes his head and requests the bill. After the waitress leaves, Ryan reaches for my hand. At first, it feels uncomfortable, forced almost. But then I decide it’s time to finally let my guard down. I embrace his warm and calming presence.

“The medics told me that she died upon impact. But I didn’t believe it. Still don’t. I really think I could have gotten there in time. I know I could have,” I tell him as I whisk a tear away.

Guilt kicks in, and I become tense. Ryan tries to reassure me that it was out of my control, but his eyes tell a different story.

I exhale deeply and dry my tears. “She could have gone to Stanford. Set records. At the very least, she could have gotten the hell out of here,” I say as I compare that dream-like scenario to my own shitty reality.

Ryan signs the receipt and looks up at me. “You couldn’t help Alexis; I know that pains you. But that doesn’t mean you can’t help others…”

I shake my head, not understanding. “I think you’d be a great coach,” he says in a tone that suggests there’s a job opening.

I shrug and tell him, “Visors don’t look good on me.”

We both laugh.

Before I know it, we’re back at his place. Yanking each other’s clothes off. I need a minute to catch my breath but I can’t stop kissing him.

I slide off my pants as he gets on top of me. He kisses my stomach. I lay my head down and my eyes roll back, basking in this moment. He continues to work his way down when—

*Tap tap.*

No no no no no. Fuck that. This can’t actually be happening. NOT RIGHT NOW.

I don’t get up, not yet at least. Maybe I was just hearing things? I run my hands through Ryan’s hair trying to enjoy the moment—

*Tap tap.*

My head darts up.

“Sorry, I’ll go slower,” Ryan says. I shake him off of me and quickly grab my clothes.

“That was amazing! Truly,” I say as I frantically slide my underwear back on.

“Uhhh… So good that you have to leave mid-way?”

*Tap tap.*

I finish putting my clothes on and I dart out of the room.

“Wait!! Delaney, wait!! Ryan says as he chases after me.

*Tap tap.*

My body shakes after each tapping sound. Ryan notices something is off, “That sound. It’s nothing. I promise. It’s just the water dripping from my sink.”

Wait, how does he hear the sound too?

Whatever. I don’t have time. I swing my jacket on and stumble out his front door. I walk home in a fit of anger. I can’t let this thing continue to torment me.

As I walk home, the streetlights above me flicker on and off. I feel like I’m going insane. It’s almost been a week now. I’m physically and emotionally drained. I can’t spend my life jumping out of office buildings. I ball up my fists and SCREAM. It echoes down the empty street.

I can’t shake the anxiety. I fall to my knees as I struggle to breathe. A car flashes its lights behind me. I don’t look back; I just want it to go away. The car slowly approaches. The windows roll down…

Ryan asks if I want a ride home. I shake my head stubbornly. Little does he know that this is my safe place. Outside. In the fucking cold.

He insists. The last thing I want to do is talk about this. He slowly follows along in the car.

“Delaney, just get inside. It’s freezing,” he tells me, now in a more demanding voice.

“I can’t. It’s not safe.”

“I promise. **It** won’t hurt you,” he tells me.

Wait.

I look at him.

And that’s when he tells me…

“I hear it too.”
