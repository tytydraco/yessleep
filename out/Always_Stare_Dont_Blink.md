"I'm not going in," I repeated for the fourth time already, but Paul was not listening.

"Come on, it's only an urban legend. Nothing's actually going to happen," Paul insisted.

"Karl, what do you think?" he asked. Karl stood blankly, staring at Paul.

"I mean, we're doing nothing else," Paul said nonchalantly.

"Well, look, I have homework, so I'm going to go home," I said, picking up my school bag from the ground.

"Look, 10 minutes. We just have to see what it actually is," Paul tried to persuade us again.

"It's a creepy house that just looks deserted. There's nothing in it other than rats and needles, probably," I said, growing more frustrated.

"10 minutes in and out. We just want to see what's going on," Paul insisted.

"No, you want to see what's going on. All I know is that place is deserted, done and dusted. karl, are you walking home?" Karl lives in my direction, so I would be walking by his house.

"Yeah, screw this. You're on your own, man."

"But guys, come on," Paul began to beg.

"Hey, you heard him. Needles and rats. I'm not into that," Karl said, walking by Paul.

"I feel you both are going to regret it. I bet you there's something really cool in there."

"Well then, you go find out and report back to us tomorrow," I said, throwing the bag over my shoulder. Karl and I began to walk away, leaving Paul standing outside the gates of the old abandoned mansion. That was the last time we ever saw Paul.

The next day at school, there was a report that Paul had gone missing. When I first talked to Karl, he asked me if we should mention the old mansion. I said no, thinking Paul wouldn't be that stupid. How wrong I was. A couple of weeks later, there was still no sign of Paul. A 16-year-old high school kid had vanished.

One Autumn evening, Karl and I were walking home from school. The wind was picking up. "Do you ever think Paul actually went in there?" I asked Karl as we walked by the old mansion. The mansion is located down some back roads; it's the quickest way home for both of us. For weeks now, we had stared at that mansion as we walked by, wondering.

"I mean, if he did go in there, is he still there?" Karl mentioned.

"Maybe we should just check it out," Karl said, curious.

"The police surely would have checked it. Why do we have to go in? What if he never went in and this is one of those dying wishes?" Karl said.

"Don't say that," I winced.

"Why?" Karl questioned.

"Because now we have to do it." We stood in the same place we last saw Paul, staring at the two-story mansion with eight windows looking back at us, the roof barely holding on.

"So, what was this urban legend again?" I asked Karl.

"She'll never run, she'll never walk, just don't blink," Karl recited poetically.

"Right, okay. Let's check it out." The gates were about eight feet tall, more like a railing with sharp spikes at the top. We threw our bags into a nearby bush and began climbing the railing. As we jumped down, our feet sunk into the gravel below. We walked the ten-meter stony path toward the front door. The door was old, creaky, and splintered. There was no doorbell or handle, so Karl let himself in. The door moaned as he opened it. Everything was dark, the place derelict. Wallpaper was peeling off, and the carpet was torn up. The house had a basic layout: a sitting room to the left, a dining room to the right, what looked like a kitchen at the back, and stairs leading to the upper floor.

"I can't see very much," Karl said in the dark. Light barely got through the boarded-up windows.

"Use your torch on your phone," I suggested. We both rummaged through our pockets and found our phones.

"Okay, I got it," Karl said. "That's better—whoa."

Karl's light shone on the wall where the wallpaper used to be. In big, bold writing were the words "Don't blink."

"Looks like we're not the first ones here," I said.

"Look, there's more," Karl said, scanning the walls. "Just stare, don't blink," he continued to read.

"This is starting to freak me out, man," I said, hoping this was just an urban legend.

"Should we go upstairs?" Karl asked.

"Is it safe?"

"I think so." We began walking upstairs, one creak after another. "Eyes open, watch her and she'll watch you. Don't blink." These were the words on the wall leading up the stairs. When we reached the landing, there were two doors, one to the left and one to the right.

"Okay, why are we even doing this? Can we just go?" I started coming to my senses.

"Come on, we're this far now. We may as well explore a little," Karl said quietly, already with his hand on the door handle to the right. Leading with the phone torch, he opened the door to reveal a double bed, a closet, and a dressing table, with one giant window facing the front garden. There was no more light coming in from the boarded windows. It was now dark, and the only light we had was from our phones. One by one, we stepped inside.

"What's that?" Karl asked as he walked over to the dressing table. He picked up what looked like a photo. "This must be her," Karl said, lighting up the photo with his phone torch.

"Must be who?" I asked.

"You know, the girl—the one from the urban legend," Karl explained.

"Urban legends can't be true. It must be someone who just used to live here," I said, walking over to Karl for a closer look. It was a picture of a girl who looked around our age, 16 or 17. The photo was black and white, showing her in what looked like a white gown, taken in the front garden of the now-abandoned house. Her smile was wide, and her eyes were wide open, staring.

Suddenly, the door to the bedroom started creaking. It was closing, and as it fully closed, it revealed a life-sized doll standing in the corner. We hadn't seen it at first because it was behind the door.

"Okay, what is that?" I said, but in an instant flash, the doll looked up. Our phones' lights shone directly on the doll's face. It was smiling, staring at us, and in another flash, the doll stepped forward.

"Don't blink, don't blink," Karl said with wide eyes. "That's her, that's her. Don't blink."

"What?" I said in a panic, unable to get the words out. She stepped forward in another flash.

"I was blinking!"

"Stop blinking! The more we blink, the closer she gets. Do not blink," Karl ordered frantically. We both stood frozen, staring at the life-sized doll.

"What do we do?" I asked, barely able to catch my breath.

"We need to leave the room," Karl said.

"She's blocking the door."

"I know," Karl replied, coming to the realization. In a flash, she stepped forward again, now just one meter away.

"How did she do that? I didn't blink!" I said in panic.

"I did. I'm sorry," Karl explained. "Okay, I'm going to take a few steps to the left; you take a few steps to the right. Keep your eyes on her. We need to get her away from the door," I said, coming up with the only solution I had.

"Karl, what happens if she touches us?"

"I don't know," Karl fought back tears. Our eyes were so dry from trying not to blink. We both moved steadily to the corners, keeping our eyes on her.

"I got dust in my eye!" Karl screamed. She was now right in front of Karl, his eyes closed shut. She raised her hands, grabbed his face, and pulled open his eyelids. He just screamed, and then silence—he was gone. She stared right at me. I slowly backed away toward the bedroom door, keeping my flashlight on her at all times.

"Please don't, please don't," I whispered to myself as tears welled up in my eyes. I had to blink. I blinked once, and she was already halfway across the bedroom, her head tilted slightly to the left, eyes wide open, staring into mine. Her smile was so horrible, hell would hate it. I backed out onto the landing, my hand on the door, carefully staring at the eyes I never wanted to see again. 

The door moaned as I closed it, and I felt relief when I heard the door handle click. The door was now closed. I turned to make my way downstairs when suddenly, two figures stood in my view on the other side of the landing. I shone my light on them—it was Paul and Karl. Their eyes were closed.

"Always stare, never blink. Always stare, never blink," they repeated again and again. They both opened their eyelids, revealing no eyes, only black voids. "Always stare, never blink." I ran down the stairs as fast as I could. They kept repeating the phrase. 

I burst open the front door and fell onto the gravel. I could still hear them: "Always stare, never blink." I ran to the big black gate, jumped halfway up, and threw myself over. When I got home, I told my mom and dad everything. They didn't believe me.

Not until they found out that Karl was also now missing. We told the police, and they conducted a search of the old mansion. They obviously found nothing. It's been a few weeks now, and due to the stories that were being told about the old mansion, they decided to tear the place down.

Karl and Paul were never found. They were never seen again—except in my dreams, standing on the top of that landing and staring into those dark voids.
