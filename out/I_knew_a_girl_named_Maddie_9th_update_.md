I don’t know what the last month has brought. I don’t even know if these messages are being sent out to the right time. I just… I can’t know.

My cabin has been patched thanks to your efforts. The winter has just barely encroached, but the linings and padding I’ve found have been lifesaving, at least, in the future, when snow will prevent me from exiting my shelter for weeks at a time.

There have been no further communications from Peter. Nothing else from Maddie. Nothing save the figures of dead animals wandering closer and closer to me, every time I wander too far off from my small semblance of civilization. I’m sorry if the latest picture fails to upload, but I managed to capture one of them, as it stalked me on my daily hunt.

I don’t know what they are.

I’m tired. I spend most of my time scrolling through text message histories and photos. I lay on the sleeping bag, watching the lichen grow and the warmth fade. I don’t know who I am anymore, am I a part of this cabin, or am I part of the forest which slowly eats and rots away the food that you’ve all brought me. Am I becoming something else entirely?

The lights are dimmer each night as the sunlight fades and whatever energy I have to muster up to clean the solar panels is too much most of the time. I watch the fading lights, the creatures who stalk me, they get closer and closer, and I no longer fear them, because they do not fear me.

Where are you?

Do you remember the forest?

Are you a part of the forest?

**u*u*88**

My little girl, taken from me by clawed hands, descended into madness the first few night, looking, praying, running, yelling, calling Peter. Nothing went through, not until I sat on a ledge and saw the deer for the first time. It made the air feel like static, and I knew I had to stay, to get them back.

 The cabin was my sanctuary, my place of peace.

Until it became a place of unnatural growth, of my wooden hands barely able to type this final instalment. I can’t leave, I can’t stay. I can’t ever go back to Peter, not without her, not without Maddie, not without her, not without me, not without me, not without me.

I am not the only one here anymore. I can feel them crawling through the cracks, they don’t scare me. The lights are no longer on, they can fester and take what they like. They can eat my food, make holes in my cot, laugh while they are jumping on my desk, they are but shadows, and they can’t harm me,

Every day I follow the tracks. I am no longer cold. I no longer feel the cold. I am something different. I have become something that doesn’t need shelter, or food, or the sanctuary of my cabin. I am at one.

My hands tremble and resemble hooves as I write this, I can no longer distinguish the two. I write this as a warning, do not remember the forest. Do not remember the forest.

I wander into the night, and I see her, I see the deer with the lichen covering her antlers, and beside her, another, nudging her slightly toward the pond they stand by.

I look into the pond, and I see the silhouette I drew so long ago in my daughters nursery, the silhouette of a pregnant deer, covered in moss, almost too human to be real.

You don't remember Peter. You don't remember your life, you just remembered the forest, and the shapes darting around you, like something you will soon become.

But at least, you finally understand, that you've found her all along.
