A flash of light hardly noticeable against the glare of the Sol Class Star Argos heralds the arrival of man for the first time to this solar system. This historic arrival will renew man’s quest for other intelligent life and forever change humanity’s view of the universe.

  
“Ok, Gentlemen, to your stations.” Captain Jason ‘Jam’ Karth announces, “Commence orbital insertion. Begin landing craft release.”

  
“Landing crafts are detaching from life support feeds,” calls out the Life Science Officer. “Launch commencing”

  
“Bring up the main viewer and open up a channel to them.” Commanded the Captain.

  
Holographic projectors display a life-like three-dimensional image in the viewing area ahead of the helm. Static buzzes momentarily as the audio channel switches over to the landing crew’s communications.

  
“Comms check, Intrepid to Hunter One, Comms check.” The lead ship radioed back in.

  
“Intrepid, this is Hunter One; we read you loud and clear. Docking clamps are disengaged, and bay doors are cycling open now.” The image shifts from the departing ships to the bridge crew of the main landing support vessel.  

“Mic check is good. This is Jack Harmin, mission leader; we are free and clear and heading to landing zone Alpha.  We will advise you of our status again once we land.  Wish us luck, Intrepid; we don't want any dinos walking on us”.

  
Everyone on the bridge laughs as the Captain chuckles. “Better that one step on you than eat you; we wouldn't want the animal rights people giving us grief over you poisoning one of them.”

  
“Funny Jam, very funny, save me some food, we'll be home for supper.” Harm laughs and reaches to cut the connection. “Oh, and Intrepid, do us a favor: keep those fighter jocks on their toes, just in case.”

  
Caleb ‘Slammer’ Jones keys in, “Roger that Hunter One, we'll be ready, just say the word if you need us.”

  
“Landing craft clear and away, sir,” the life sciences officer calls out.

  
“Ok, nothing more for us to do now but wait for Harm to report back. Everyone stand down and get some rest before the real fun begins.” The Captain looked out the windows at the blue jewel hanging in the night beyond the bow of the ship.

  
The fleet of landing craft starts their descent to the surface of this uncharted oasis.  Elos, a planet discovered five years ago by a robotic survey unit. The surveyors launched three years before man finally broke the lightspeed barrier in 2025.  Luckily for the exploration crews sent out to chart the now accessible void, these old robot surveyors had help reporting discoveries like Elos. The International Space Administration sent crewless hyperspace transmitters into the depths of space to act as re-transmitters should any older craft find planets capable of supporting life. The explorers no longer need to wait centuries for the robots to report back.

  
“Beautiful planet, John, maybe we should make ourselves a home down there and tell Humanity to bugger off.” Harm looks over at John Ranstan, his co-commander.

  
John smiles, “Forget it, Harm, you know you couldn't live an hour without your Holonovels.”

  
“Yeah, well, what about you and your women addiction?”  Harm chuckles.

  
“Hush, damn you before one of the ladies on this tub finds out.” John winks and grins mischievously.

  
“Heads up, old buddy, coming into the atmosphere, everyone buckle up and prepare for touchdown.” Harm tenses as he maneuvers the landing craft into the glide path for descent.  
“All craft, button-up nav antennas and prepare for atmospheric turbulence.  Increase anti-grav units to compensate, and pitch noses 2 degrees down.” Harmin broadcasts to the rest of the landing fleet.

  
Firing orbital thrusters, the flotilla of landing craft extend atmospheric stabilizers and descends into the planet’s stratosphere. As the group of craft descends through fluffy white clouds all too similar to Earth's, Harm thinks over the data on the planet. Only the second Earth equivalent planet to be found in 100 years. Eros is a planet currently experiencing the equivalent of Earth’s Jurassic period.  Unlike Earth, there doesn’t appear to be any larger carnivores that inhabited Earth’s dinosaur era.  There are large land creatures, but the ones spotted by the robotic surveyors seem to be of a type similar to a brontosaurus or triceratops. A few winged creatures not much different from the birds found on earth now, making this pretty much an ideal situation for colonization and exobiology.  
A thud breaks Harm out of his reverie.

  
“Turbulence is picking up; there appears to be a small storm going on below us,” John says. “We should fly out of the disturbance in seconds.” 

  
The craft’s main windows billow with the black wisps of heavy cloud cover.  Suddenly, the ships break through to blue skies, bluer than has been seen on earth in many decades.

  
“Stunning” Harm sighs. “Let’s hope they keep it that way. I may want to retire here.”

  
“You retire? HA, not bloody likely, more likely you and me are going to get killed one day on some godforsaken shithole like Begala prime.” John shivers from the memory.

  
“Oh, come on, what’s the chance of finding another species of animal plated with organic armor that could withstand blaster fire.” Harm smiles as he adjusts some glide computations.

  
“Well, we’ll discuss that possibility later. Right now, the radar shows that we are coming up on the landing site.”  John adjusts the resolution of the 3D radar headset. “Thermal scans show no life signs in the general landing site. Radar and robot probes show good soil composition, solid bedrock underneath, no surprises that I can see”.

  
“Ok.” Harm cuts in the inter-ship intercom: “All ships, the landing site is green. I repeat, landing site is a go. Descend as soon as you are ready.”

  
Hunter One and the rest of the landing craft descend gently on a combination of thrusters and anti-gravitational fields.

  
“Touchdown in five, four, three, two, one, touchdown.” Harm looks over at the landing display and watches as each 3D representation of his fleet lands and turns green on the map. As the last one turns green, he keys the ship’s comms. “Intrepid, this is Hunter One, all birds down safe. Beginning scans of atmospheric quality and roll out of all ATVs.”

  
“Roger, Hunter One, we received the message and are standing by to deliver any assistance you might need.  Good luck and happy hunting.” The waiting spacecraft acknowledges.

  
Harm flips off the toggles for the craft’s flight systems and gravity units. “Ok, Life Sciences, what's the air like outside.”

  
“Temperature is thirty-two point two, two Celsius, a nice balmy earth day, air composition ninety-nine point nine, nine percent earth equivalent with point zero one percent methane probably due to the nearby swamp.  There are no known airborne pathogens and no unusual elements in the micro-scan. I give it the green light, sir, it should be like breathing earth air before industrialization.”

  
“In other words, the best air our lungs will likely ever get the privilege to use,” Harm smiles. “Ok, let us open this tin can up and smell what Mother Nature got cooking.”

  
Harm touches a pad switch, and the ship begins to rumble as hanger doors fold up along the side of the beetle-shaped ship.  Ramps extend out from both sides of the ship, sliding down to contact the ground with a thud.  Three long-range robotic surveyors float out on small high-capacity hover fans, pausing to take a compass reading using the landing craft’s transponder as its North Pole.  Once the crafts calibrate their compasses, the three robots speed off at supersonic speeds on preprogrammed flight paths. Their goal is to survey distant parts of the continent for future landing sites for colonists.

  
Harm stands up and checks his data links and comm-links. “Ok, men init your systems and download the maps, I just want a standard survey first, and then we can start mineral digs.”

  
His crew unbuckles and moves toward the back of the crew cabin. Cycling the airlock, they walk out into the vehicle storage area. Several hover platforms equipped with multiple geological survey devices roll out on platforms as six all-terrain vehicles are guided by cargo robots onto the ramps leading outside. Four hover-type scouts are set on the ground outside the vehicle bay. Each craft crew moves to their prospective transportation as it is unloaded from a ship. The maintenance chief and his robotic helpers power up the vehicles and run last-minute checks on electronics and power plants.

  
“Ok Boss, everything appears to be good to go, you can have my babies now, but you better bring ‘em back as you got them.” The Chief chuckles as he says this and turns to a workbench full of assorted parts, that only he knows where they go.

  
Harm looks over the field as the other ships unload their crews and equipment, keying the comms he begins his standard pre-mission spiel. 

“Ok, I want all standard safety procedures followed. Stay alert, get lax, and you could get dead. I want a standard survey spread.  Survey Platforms One and Five, I want you to head vector six zero six with a six-kilometer spread between scan beams.”  Harm looks down at his tablet for the mission plan. “Use full spectrum scanning and stop at the southern marshes and hold there until the eastern team finishes at the eastern marsh edge. Both teams then head toward the coast until you meet at the southeastern tip. Link up and get some readings on that chain of islands, then head back here.  East crew Platforms 2 and 4, same spread as One and Five, but your vector will be three zero three.”

  
The first two sets of hovercraft flew off to their destinations.

  
“Platforms Three and Six, head west at vectors nine zero eight, eight-kilometer spread.” He points at another set of pilots. “Seven and Eight, head north vector twelve-twelve, same spread. Ok, the rest of you will start on the mining surveys and colony location mapping." Harmin looks over at the rest of his crew. "Shell and Mica, gear up and follow John and me, we are heading to the depressed area in the northeast, I want to see what caused that. If it’s a meteor or asteroid impact, I intend to see how long ago it was."

  
The various teams move off to their assignments.  Harm’s team starts the journey towards the largest single landmark seen from space.

  
“Harm, the radiation level is starting to rise.” John said.

  
“How high?” Harm looks over at his friend with concern.

  
“About point five, five, two, on the tri-beta scale,” he reports.

  
“You sure you have that thing calibrated right? Tri-beta is only present at the landing sites of hyperdrive ships.” Harm looks over at John’s screens.

  
“Well, that may be, but the reading is there, and the closer we get to the depression, the higher it’s rising.” John scowls at the reading. “If it keeps rising like this, we will be at levels equal to that at the IO Starport.”

  
“Link me to Shell on the private channel,” growls Harm.

  
“Linked.” Replies John.

  
“Shell, you see the rads?” Harmin asks the other driver.

  
“Sure do, Harm,” A southern female drawl comes back across the comms. “Do we need to worry?”

  
“Not yet,” John says. “The radiation is in the tri-beta wavelength.”

  
“That’s not possible.” Tila Shell said in disbelief.

  
“Yeah, I know, but the analyzer seems to be working right.” John returns.

  
Harm grunts as the vehicle’s multiple wheels drop in and out of a large hole. “Could there be a crashed ship near here?”

  
“We are the first Terran ship to visit this system.” Shell curses loudly over the comm as her vehicle bounces hard from the hole. “Shit, Harm, why don’t we upgrade these things to some of those new hover rigs?”

  
“Because the company will not go for it, they say it’s not a necessary expense, besides only runty weaklings ride in those luxury machines. This abuse will make a man out of you.” Harm grins as he replies.

  
“Ah, excuse me, but if you hadn’t noticed, I’m not a man.” Shell protests.

  
Harm chuckles slyly. “I’ve noticed, believe me, I’ve definitely noticed.”

  
“Well, if you want to keep noticing, I suggest you talk to the bean counters and see what you can do!” Shell admonishes.

  
“Uh, guys, I hate to break up your foreplay, but the meter just spiked again, we have now officially reached rad levels equal to IO Starport”. John's voice has a note of astonishment as he reports the levels.

  
Harm stops the vehicle and Shell pulls up short behind him. “What the fuck Harm? Are you trying to wreck us?”

  
“No, I want a flyover before we go any farther.” Harm reaches over and changes the com system over to Intrepid's frequency.  “Explorer Group One to Intrepid.”

  
“Go ahead, EG One, we read you.”

  
“We have a radiation anomaly near the northeastern depression. It has us a little worried, so I’m requesting a flyover, I don’t want any unexpected problems,” Harm reports back.

  
“Copy that EG One, what kind of radiation emissions are the flyboys looking for?” Asks the communications officer.

  
“Tri-beta in large quantities,” replies Harm.

  
“Roger that, got them coming in,” comes the reply.

  
Twin sparks flash high in the sky above them, followed by twin sonic booms, the only two weapons allowed on the explorer ships. Two hypersonic fighters, capable of Mach 15 or better, sweep down over the fifty square-mile depression, bringing to bear military quality radar, threat assessment, and radiation sensors.

  
“Knight Flight to EG One, tri-beta rads off the scale all over the plateau, there appears to be several large mounds with high concentrations near the middle of the depression. No threats are visible, it looks safe apart from the radiation,” Transmits the lead ship.

  
“Thanks, Knight Flight. Safe return guys, thanks for the heads-up.,” Harm calls.

  
“Roger EG One. Be careful down there, replies the flight leader. “We will sit in Geo orbit until you give us the all-clear.”

  
“Copy and thanks again.” Harm cuts the com.

  
“Okay. Everyone put on your rad shields and move out.”

  
Each of the team straps on a small armband that starts emitting a small humming sound as they turn them on.  Driving to the edge of the depression through the small, thin forest, the strangeness of the entire scene is deeply impressed on the minds of the exploration crew.

  
“My God!” Shell exclaims. “Harm, do you know what this is? It’s a real Alien spaceport!”

  
“Shell, let’s not jump to any conclusion,” warns Harm. “Those mounds and structured outcroppings could just be natural formations of an as yet undiscovered erosion process.”

  
“Bullshit Harm, and you know it,” Shell growls over the intercom.  Growing ever more excited, she nearly yells into the mic. “Look over to the left, something just flashed like a strobe or metal turning in the sun.”

  
“Ok, ok, if this is a real artifact sight, we need to follow all the guidelines.”  Harm looks over at his friend. “John, you and Mica set the mobile scanner up, while Shell and I take the rovers down that ramp-like incline and have a look around.”

  
As John and Mica get out of their rovers, both cargo sections release legs and detach from the back of the rovers.  They start assembling parts of a robotic survey scanner as the rovers move off to the ramp to the inside of the depression.

  
“Shell, take it slow, I’m not confident of how firm this ground is.” Even as the warning is spoken, the whole slope along with both vehicles slides slowly down the incline.  “Damn. Hold on Shell, keep it straight, and we should be ok.”

  
The vehicles rock and shudder as the unstable ground slides and shifts on its slow trip to the bottom.  
John looks over where the vehicles started down. Grabbing Mica’s shoulder, he whirls him around, pointing toward the slope.  “The rovers are sliding out of control”.

  
They both run to the edge of the thirty-foot drop.

  
“Can we do anything to help them?” Mica asked as they looked down at the descending patch of ground.

  
“No, they’ll be at the bottom before we can do anything to stop them.” John grimaces as the rovers smack into each other with loud crunching sounds as they pile up on the bottom.

  
“Harm, Harm! SHIT.” John yells into his mic, with no response, he turns back toward the detached cargo bays as he locks the com open.

  
“Come on, let’s get the climbing gear and get down there fast,” he yells, frantically grabbing the gear.

  
Quickly, they don their climbing gear. Each pack is a low-power anti-grav unit with just enough juice to float a full-size adult down a cliff at a safe speed. This is coupled with a compact winch unit designed to lift the climber and up to three hundred pounds of gear back up most mountainsides.  Attaching the hooks to the cargo sections, they drop down the cliff face as fast as the units will safely allow them. Hitting the bottom at a run, they pop the quick-release buttons on the packs.

  
“Come on, Mica, hurry” John starts yelling on the still open mic. “Harm, Shell, are you guys ok? Harm, Shell, answer us, damn it.”

  
Reaching the rovers, the men dig at the bottom of the driver's doors to get enough room to open them.

  
“Harm, are you ok?” John reaches in and grabs Harm’s shoulder and helps lift him up off the steering console.

  
“Ow!” Harm reaches up to the small trickle of blood coming from his forehead.  “I’m ok, how is Tila?”

  
I don’t know, Mica is with her, I’ll go check.”  John runs over to the other rover.  “Mica, how is Shell?”

  
“She’s coming around, looks like she's got a bump on the head and her arm may be sprained.” Mica helps Shell out of the rover.

  
“Stop hovering over me like a med bot, damn it, I’m fine. Move so I can check on the damage to Old Betsy.” SHell franticly looks over the crashed All Terrain Vehicle.

  
At that, Harm, who had just walked up, burst out laughing.  “Will you listen to that boys, a little bit ago she was threatening mutiny if she didn’t get a new hover unit, now she’s all tore up over a little dent in her rover”. He snickers more, then sways dangerously.

  
“Sit down, Harm, before we have to pick you up from a face plant.” John admonishes his old friend  


Walking around the two rovers, Tila Shell sounds like an insurance adjuster as she gives a verbal estimate of the damages.

  
“Nothing unfixable, a dent here, a dent there, nothing Chief and his mechanical monkeys can’t bang out. ‘Course, Chief will skin us alive when he finds out we dinged up his babies.” She grimaces.

  
Harm manages to sit down before he passes out.

  
“Ooh,” he moans, fighting the tunnel effect around his eyes. “Ow, I guess my head is softer than it looks.”

  
Both Shell and John rush over to him.

  
“Harm, what caused that slide, the ground looked solid enough.” Shell applies gauze and healer spray to his wounds.

  
Before Harm can reply, Mica shouts out.  “I know, look!”   He points back up the slope. Gasping, they all gaze at an exposed sheet of golden metal uncovered by the slide

  
“What the….”  Harm stops mid-sentence; his mouth drops open wide enough to fit a starship in as he takes in the impossibility of the scene before him.  Shaking the cobwebs from his head, Harm issues orders.  “John, Mica, get that surveyor running and get it down here fast.  Shell, contact the other teams and get them here fast, then call the Captain. And tell him what we’ve found.”

  
“And what are you going to do, Boss?” Shell says snarkily.

  
“Puke and find something for this huge migraine” Harm smiles weakly.

  
Shell winks at him. “Wimp.”
