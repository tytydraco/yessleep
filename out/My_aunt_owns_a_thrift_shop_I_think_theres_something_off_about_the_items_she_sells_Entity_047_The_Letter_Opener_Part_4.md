Aunt Gigi got back twenty minutes later. As soon as she walked in the door, I nearly assaulted her, shouting in her face everything that happened. “I could have died!” I whined as I followed her to her office.

“You wouldn’t have *died*. You would’ve still been alive, inside your body, just, not… in control of things.”

“That’s even worse!”

“I’m sorry. I never should have brought you here.” She shook her head, then looked up at me. Her eyebrows knotted. “Wait, what’s that?”

“This?” I asked, pointing to the scratch below my eye. “That’s when the demon-poltergeist thing tried to gouge my eyes out with a knife.”

She paled. “Which knife exactly?”

“Uh…”

“Nadia, this is *important.* Which knife?!”

“Wait.” My heart began to pound. “You’re not—are you saying—the knife is an entity?!”

“*Everything in this store is an entity!”* she shouted, before getting up and hurrying out of the office.

*I should’ve thought of that. Of course… if I’d grabbed anything with a price tag on it, it was an entity. Of course.*

*Oh, no.*

She came back with two knives. The first was what appeared to be a chef’s knife, though the edge was browned with rust. The second was a thin dagger, possibly a letter opener—not the one from Aunt Gigi’s office, that we’d stabbed Entity #099 with.

She set them on the desk before me.

“Which one, Nadia?”

“That one,” I said, pointing to the letter opener.

“Fuck. Fuck, fuck, *fuck.”* She buried her head in her hands.

“What?!”

Without a word, she hurried past me into the shop. She came back, holding the manual, frantically flipping through it. Without a word, she plopped it down in front of me.

*Entity #047*

*Class IV*

*Presentation: An ornate letter opener, with a silver blade and an obsidian hilt. The blade is engraved with sigils that remain indecipherable. The hilt is engraved with a Viking rune that roughly translates to “SEPARATION”.*

*Safety Precautions: #047 is safe to handle by conventional means in its inactive state. It is activated by the presence of blood. If it touches the living blood of another human, it will temporarily translocate that human into MZ-51-9 (colloquially known as “The Shadow World” by supernaturalists.)*

*Recovery Procedures: None known.*

*Origin: #047 was found in northern Denmark, buried under layers of ice and soil, with other Viking artifacts.*

“The *Shadow World?!”* I shouted.

“It’s temporary,” she said hastily. “See? Right there. It says ‘temporary.’ So you won’t be gone forever, you’ll just—”

“How long?”

“Um… well… I don’t know. Time passes differently there. And it’s not really quite that different, the Shadow World. It’s actually superimposed on this world, so you’ll be in the same location and see all of us, even, you just won’t be able to interact—”

“How long?!”

“It’s dependent on how much of the blade was in contact with your blood, and for how long. My guess is just a few hours. Although, it may feel… a *bit* longer… for you.”

“A bit longer? Days? Weeks? Months?” I spat. “*Years?!”*

“I don’t know.”

But I could see the transformation already taking place. I hadn’t noticed it before, but the edges of my vision had become… desaturated. Like beyond a certain point, the world was black and white. And smudged, like paint. I blinked, rubbed my eyes, and whirled around. The effect didn’t go away.

“I can see it,” I told her. “My peripheral vision’s black and white.”

She gave me a sad look.

I ran out of the office to find Kira. I told her everything. She began to cry. “What if you die in there?” she asked, her voice wavering. “Do you die out here, too?”

“I don’t know.”

She wrapped me in a hug. “This isn’t fair. Your aunt sucks.”

“I know. I think we should quit, maybe.”

“That would probably be for the best.”

When I opened my eyes again, half of my vision was in black and white. I could see Kira’s rosy cheeks and pink sweater, but everything outside of my central vision was smudgy and gray. I noticed movement now, too: figures walking to and fro in the darkness, smudges of white, flitting back and forth.

Like ghosts. Spirits.

“Will they hurt me?” I called to Aunt Gigi.

She didn’t turn around.

And then I realized. Kira was screaming. Her mouth was open in an O, but there was no sound. “Kira?” I shouted. “*Kira!”*

No one reacted.

I whirled around, at the specters flitting around the edges of my vision. As soon as I looked at them, they disappeared. Like staring at a dim star. Only seeing it indirectly.

*Fuck.*

Kira and Aunt Gigi were clearly moving in slow-motion. Maybe half-speed, maybe less. I frantically ran around the shop, screaming for help. Nothing. I ran out onto the sidewalk. I cried for help. The people walking around didn’t even give me a glance.

Then I felt a hot, searing pain in my arm. I yanked back—to see, for a second, a ghostly man looming over me. His skin was light gray and his eyes were dark, sunken pits, staring deep into my soul. As soon as I looked directly at him, he disappeared.

But I could still feel the pain shooting up my arm, from where he held tight to my arm. He was still there—just invisible to my central vision.

I yanked and flailed and struggled away. I fell right into the street. An SUV barreled towards me and I screamed—but the car passed right *through* me.

I was a ghost.

I ran back into the shop. Paced around, arm still pulsing with pain. When I tried to touch anything, my hand went right through it. Like it was an illusion. I stood in front of the antique suit of armor that Aunt Gigi kept at the back of the store. Extended my arm through its chest. My arm went through the thick metal, through the cavity, and out the other side.

Actually. The cavity wasn’t empty. I could feel pulsating warmth under the cold iron of the chest plate. I shivered and yanked my hand back out, heart pounding.

*Holy shit.*

Okay, so the suit of armor was an entity. I should’ve known that. That shouldn’t have been a surprise. Kira and I had gone over the manual, but there were almost a thousand entities, so we’d skipped quite a bit.

I took a deep breath—actually, it wasn’t a breath. I couldn’t breathe here. But I felt my chest puff up as *if* I were taking a breath.

I stared at the suit of armor.

And then I realized it was faintly glowing.

There was a faint, gold glow around the entire suit. I glanced around—and realized every item, every entity for sale, in the shop was faintly glowing gold. The dresses on the rack. The books on the shelf. The rocking chair in the corner. The vintage music box on the table. They were all glowing, faintly, colors of gold and purple and scarlet.

I wandered back towards Kira and Aunt Gigi. Kira was sobbing. Aunt Gigi was comforting her. I stood next to them, wrapping my arms around them, but of course they couldn’t feel me. I didn’t know Kira was such a crier. It was touching.

I stepped back.

And then I noticed something.

There was a sickly green glow coming from Aunt Gigi’s chest.

*What the…*

I leaned in. She was wearing a necklace of some kind, and it was glowing green. It was a pendant of some kind. Hidden under her cardigan, which was buttoned up to the neck.

My brain started and stuttered a few times as the pieces fell into place.

Aunt Gigi… was *wearing* an Entity.

And she was purposely hiding it.

Hours passed. Kira went home. Then Aunt Gigi. I was left all alone in the dark shop, nothing more but a ghost. At least the other ghosts didn’t seem to bother me here. Maybe they respected that this was *my* space.

I came to at 2:37 AM, lying on the floor, my entire body convulsing like I’d just touched a live wire.

I ran to the bathroom and puked my guts out.

I grabbed my phone to call Kira, my parents, to tell them I was okay—but then I realized, I wasn’t sure I wanted them to know I was back.

How much did Aunt Gigi know about the Shadow World?

Did she know that I knew she was wearing an Entity?

So I walked to the 24/7 convenience store, bought an enormous Slurpee, and walked back into the thrift shop. I turned on the lights, incandescent bulbs flaring in the glass-blown sconces, and texted Kira.

*Meet me at the thrift shop.*

*Now.*
