Hi guys, sorry for english mistakes but not my native tongue.

I've just received the strangest phone call of my entire life. It was coming from an Australian number, from the same city where I live, in this same country.

For context, I received it straight after I relocated into my new apartment, after 1 month at the hotel, because I'm new in town. This apartment has really huge windows, and a balcony, and because I'm on low level in the building, people can see a bit what's happening inside from the street.

When I picked up the phone, a certain named David introduced him, pretending working for a company helping to get our assets back after our money being stolen, in a very direct, threatening and aggressive tone. Because of the noise from the street and people chatting behind him, I didn’t understand what he was saying at first, and he got really mad about that, about me asking him to say it again. The way he spoke to me was very strange, full of confidence and quite robotic.

And the creepy twist happened: he asked me to get closer from a window, so that we could understand way better each other. This guy knew what was going on, because I was at the opposite side of my windows, really far from them. The fact is that starting this moment, I understood that something was really wrong with this call and that I better should to not play his game. I then decided to say "done", which was false because I don't moved at all. 

He knew I was lying, and asked me to go directly outside, meaning in the street I guess, so that he could hear me better and speak with his real voice. My doubts were confirmed, I was talking with someone using AI. All this call wasn't a prank speech already recorded from the caller part, few of my answers and sentences were completely unexpected and incongruous to dismiss this hypothesis, and the answers of this famous David were quite consistent. He was a real human using AI.

I hung up after that, feeling totally spied on and violated in my privacy, and afraid that he could collect I don’t know what data about me if I let the call last too long. 

I've been through many research on internet, with potential similar cases, I've take a look at the phone number on the internet but I don't find anything wrong. To let you know guys, I'm new in the country, there's no way my phone number which is all new has been sold to I dont know which scam/phone phising company.

Last important point of context: relationship with my manager has been really bad since I started working here, 3 weeks ago. This guy is really xenophobic (I'm not a native Australian) and hates me, treating me like a waste of time/energy. I had an interview with him yesterday to talk about my situation and it went really bad, him getting really mad, rude, nervous, angry and yelling at me because I was complaining about the current situation at work. He really scared me, and he knew he went too far and will have HR issues with such a behaviour, because all of these HR + other managers are aware of the situation and he's already getting into trouble.

This guy is truly crazy, nervous and dangerous and knows everything about his employees (he has no life, spend all his day on monitoring my actions). He knows where I live, and I really consider the possibility that this guy is behind this fucking creepy story. But if that was the case, would it be possible for him to mandate anyone to give me a scaring call? With a non-anonymous phone number ?

Guys this shit was truly scary and I feel really unsafe, I already want to move from this shitty appartment. What are your opinions about it ? Maybe some of you have experienced the same kind of story ? Was that juste a scam call? But if so what's the use ? I mean they don't earn any money if they call me. The objective of this call was just to really scare me. Nothing financial or whatever behind.

Thanks guys,

Stay safe.
