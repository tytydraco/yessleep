Here’s a preface: You probably won’t like me. I’m an alcoholic, a deadbeat, and I’ve probably been called a ‘dick’ on more occasions than I’ve been called my own name. You could hurl pretty much any insult in the book at me and I’d probably say “Yeah, fair enough.” But, I promise you this: If there’s *one* thing I’m not, it’s crazy.



Then again, nobody really thinks they’re crazy, do they? Even if they’re fucking nuts. There’s a guy who basically sleeps on the floor of this rundown shithole dive I frequent who I’m convinced can do nothing but wriggle on the floor and make the sound ‘Grup’ over, and over, and over again. Million bucks says he’d swear he’s the sanest man in the room, though, if anyone could understand a fucking word he said. 



Who knows, though. Maybe one day I’ll be down there with him, writhing around on the cracked, unwaxed tiles of some crappy ‘establishment’, speaking nonsense and flailing my arms around trying to snatch up the discarded butt of an old cigarette with only one puff left in it before it’s nothing but ash.



Point is: I’m broke, and I don’t mean the everyday ‘getting by’ kind of broke, I mean the *real* kind of broke. The actual *having no money* kind. 



Ask my parents for money? They’re dead. Ask my friends for money? Hah! What friends?!



You want to know how hard up I was? I wasn’t even *winked at* in his will, but I had tried *desperately* to sell my late Grandpa’s cabin and pocket the cash, which, I might add, he’d built with his own hands. 



Actually, that’s precisely what I’m here to talk about. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t sell it! Don’t get me wrong, I never had a change of heart. I just *couldn’t* sell it. They wouldn’t let me.



I would have done it all over the phone if I could, spare myself the effort of actually getting up and going somewhere, but I had no idea who I’d even call. Finally, I’d decided I should ring the town hall up there in the boonies where his cabin was, see if I was too late. Maybe the thing had already sold; he had been dead for three years, after all. 



Know what they told me?



“We don’t know, sorry.”Fucking *town hall* doesn’t know if the place is abandoned or not. Isn’t that supposed to be, like, the ONE THING they do? Keep records of this shit?!



I had no choice. Either I head up there and figure this out for myself, or I starve.



Took me *three buses* and *fourteen hours* to get up there. Lucky for me, I had nothing better to do- a regular occurrence. Twelve more minutes of walking and I was there.



Standing before the cabin, my last hope, I didn’t know what to think. There were no signs staked in the *very* overgrown yard, nor were there any cars parked in the long gravel driveway, nor were there even *any* lights. Praying that I wasn’t too late to nobody in particular, I made my way down the road to what I had been assured was the absolute cheapest motel around, bar none. 



There it was: The Heart Ache Motel (or the ‘Hert Che Motel’ as the sign read, seemingly having had the misfortune of both ‘a’s shorting out at once). The rickety roadside building could only be made out ever-so-slightly in the encroaching dark, but I could see that The Heart Ache Motel was absolutely the ‘You’re *totally* not gonna die in your sleep, honest!’ type of establishment- murder magnets, I called them. 



I couldn’t care less, though, so I booked in for a night with what little I had left on hand. I still had my debit card, of course, but I hardly had *anything* on that; I guess I just found the idea of a homeless man with a debit card oddly amusing, and that sure as hell seemed to be where I was heading.



Entering my room, I wasted no time before flopping on what the Heart Ache Motel loosely referred to as a ‘bed’. Moments later, though, I heard a knock on my door. 



Groaning in exhausted frustration, I shambled over to the door and pulled the thing open with an ear-piercing screech of rusted metal on rusted metal ringing from its hinges, half-expecting to find the motel clerk standing out there, ready to kick me out because my cash had *somehow* been declined. That’d be just my luck.



But, it wasn’t.



It was a woman.



Her face softened into a warm smile as she saw me, while I stood quiet and dumbfounded in the doorway. 



“Jonah?” 



I said nothing. I only nodded.



“Oh, my…” Her lip quivered. She was beginning to cry. “I’m *so* sorry for your loss…” She sniffled, wiping away a streak of tears from her cheek, before she dove towards me and wrapped her arms around my abdomen, catching me in a tight embrace.



I was obviously baffled as she sobbed into my chest. I felt her tears soaking into the torn fabric of my grimy t-shirt as her body hugged against mine.



I was confused, but I didn’t move. Pathetic as it sounds, this was the first time I’d even touched a woman in *years* now, and I was hesitant to cut it short with any unnecessary questions like ‘Who are you?’ or ‘How do you know my name?’



Tears still streaming down her flushed cheeks, she finally pulled back and wiped her face clean. “Sleep well…” She murmured through choking breaths, turned on her heel, and with that… She was gone. 



For a few more seconds, I stood in the doorway like an idiot, before finally retreating inside. However, I couldn’t even make it across the room to get back in bed before the phone suddenly rang, which frankly scared the shit out of me.



“Hello?” I muttered weakly as I picked up the receiver, slowly sitting down on the edge of the mattress.



“Jonah?” A crackling voice replied.



“... Yes?”



“I’m so sorry for your loss.” 



“... Who is this?” I finally managed to ask.



“Bob,” They replied as if it was obvious. “Bob Tucker. Lucy said you were in town, and… Well, I *had* to call.”



Lucy… I figured she must’ve been the woman just now. Guess she was spreading the word.



“Is this about my grandfather?” I furrowed my brows as if I were giving a squint of suspicion to some invisible man across the room.



“‘Course!” Bob exclaimed, “Who else?”



“... Thanks, I suppose…”



“It’s the *least* I could do. You take care now.”



“You too…” I mumbled, placing the receiver back down on its base. 



Moments, and I mean mere *moments* later, the phone rang *AGAIN*. Some guy named Frank something-or-rather, calling to say what else but he’s sorry for my loss. Then came a woman named Laura Brown. Then Mike Lasco- ‘Mikey’ as he *insisted* I call him. Then Ron Holmcrest. Then… God, I don’t even remember, it was ENDLESS, a never-ending stream of condolences and ‘I’m so sorry’s. Lucy must’ve been a real blabbermouth. 



Eventually, I unplugged the phone so I could finally get some sleep, and you’ll never guess what I woke up to. Letters. A whole *stack* of them held together with elastic bands, all from people I’d never even heard of before expressing their you-know-whats.



I’d had it. Why the fuck were so many people so torn up about the death of some old man who, might I add, was probably a bigger douche than I was? Concerning, yes, but nothing that half of a lukewarm bottle of brandy from my bag at 8 a.m. couldn’t fix. A few swigs of my medicine and I was right as rain, stumbling down the road drunkenly back towards the cabin. I needed to know whether there were people there, ‘cause then I couldn’t possibly weasel my way into selling the place.



Twenty minutes later I was shambling up the cabin’s walkway. Still no signs. Still no cars. Still no lights. No signs of life whatsoever. 

Before me stood the front door. For some reason, my drunken mind’s first instinct wasn’t to knock, but instead to lean in and peer through the glass of the French door. Unfortunately, I’d only ever been there once before as a young kid, so I couldn’t tell you if there was anything amiss for the life of me. What I *can* tell you, though, is that as I scanned across the cabin’s interior… my blood suddenly turned cold.



Eyes. Staring right at me. 



Adrenaline coursed through my body, but I neither fought nor fled: I froze. As I stood there, pressed against the glass, I found the door suddenly giving way as I tumbled inside, smacking my chin *hard* against the hardwood floor as a fine spray of blood speckled the ground. 



Cursing loudly, I finally scrambled to my feet, looking up shakily as I clamped a hand down on my throbbing jaw. 



Fuck me.



A picture.



Just a fucking picture. It was a big one at that, though; almost as tall as I was, the ornately framed picture displayed a suited, sternly resolute man staring at the camera- at *me*. I recognised him immediately.



“Hey, Gramps.” I groaned, dusting myself off. Guess the place *was* abandoned. That, or the new owners have shitty taste in art and this is all a huge mistake. 



Honestly? I was too drunk to care.



As my heartbeat slowed and I came back to my senses, I began to notice the most bizarre, god-awful smell I had *ever* smelled. I mean this was *bad*, like shit and rot and awfulness with a hint of potpourri. I covered my nose and looked around, eyes watering from the stinging miasma.



There, to my right, was the source of the smell. A looooong mahogany dining table stretched across the room, lined with seats, and before each seat sat a plate. On each plate was a hefty helping of what I assume was once food, only now it had gone so thoroughly rotten it was nothing but reeking, discoloured masses covered in maggots and mould. It was like a dinner preserved in time… Well, except for the food, that is. THAT had *certainly* aged. 



However, at the head of the table was a massive, regal-looking chair which had been almost completely buried in a heap of flowers. Daisies, tulips, roses… Some seemed old and wilted, others fresh and lively. They did almost nothing to mask the stink though, if that was what was intended.



Weirded out as I was, I had to get away from that damn smell, and as my feet carried me away, I soon found myself descending the stairs into the cabin’s cramped basement. I didn’t know where my feet were taking me, but I didn’t care, as long as it was away from that putrid mess.



As the glow of morning light slipped off of my skin, I descended deeper into the brisk darkness. As if I were on autopilot, my body moved ever forward, further and further… 



Until I came across a door.



It was clearly a very old door, battered and chipped, weathered and dirty. All by its lonesome it stood at the end of the hall, completely silent and perfectly still. It wasn’t lost on me then, nor is it now, that among the ornate furniture and snooty French doors, this thing stood out. I mean, it practically looked like it had been lifted from some sunken wreck, yet here it was. In my Grandpa’s basement. And HE put it here. He *had* to have! He built the damn place after all.



I turned the rusty knob. Nothing. I didn’t know if it was locked or the crappy thing was stuck, but it wouldn’t budge. Still thoroughly hammered, I took a small step back before launching myself forward, throwing my weight against the door with a dull thud. Nothing. Again.



Again, I threw myself against it to no avail. 



I *know*, I *know*, it was *just* a door, but… God. I wanted to get in. I *needed* to get in. I don’t know why but I felt like… I don’t know, like behind that door was the answer to a question I hadn’t even *begun* to ask. 



I slammed my shoulder into the door.



I don’t fucking know! I was drunk, what do you want from me?! The best, and I mean the *best* explanation I can possibly come up with is that I drunkenly stumbled across some weird door in my grandpa’s basement, and I wanted to know what was on the other side so badly because I hoped there was some heinous shit back there that would make me not feel so bad about dumping the crappy old man’s house, but even THAT feels wrong. I NEEDED TO GET BACK THERE.



I just *needed* to, and the longer I threw myself against that door, the more I *needed* it. 



I was so caught up slamming against that door that I never even heard the footsteps above me, or behind me, as a hand gripped my raw, bruised shoulder. I was so fucking scared I couldn’t even scream.



I turned.



Two cops stood behind me; one had their hand firmly over my shoulder, and the other was practically shining a flashlight in my face.



“You can’t be here,” said the closer one.



“I knoooow…” I slurred pathetically, hanging my head low.



“Come on, Jonah,” said the other in a soft but commanding tone. 



Defeated, I trudged behind them down the hallway, up the stairs, and out of the cabin. A patrol car now sat in the previously empty driveway, and, almost instinctively at this point, I held up my wrists to be cuffed.

But I wasn’t.



I was merely given a slight smile and was told to put my arms down. I wasn’t under arrest. I was confused, but I wasn’t complaining. 



They asked me where I was staying. 



I told them the Heart Ache Motel.



They offered to drive me there.

I accepted. As they opened the door for me, I stepped into the patrol car- the first time I’d voluntarily done such a thing in my life.



Not a word more was spoken the whole way back. They drove me to the motel in silence, waved me off, and drove away. I was alone again.



With nothing left in me, I stumbled up to my room, rolled onto the rickety bed, and lay there quietly, waiting to sober up.



Well, I’m sober now. For the moment, at least. I’m still thinking about that damned door. 



It’s been a day and I’m at the library using their computers. I’ve been trying to find a realtor who can help me out with my little scheme for hours but everyone, and I mean every SINGLE ONE, has told me ‘I can’t’. When I ask why the fuck not, they either hang up or say something like ‘I just can’t’. 



I’m still thinking about that door! I don’t know why!I need to say this stuff, talk about it, get it out. I can’t stop THINKING ABOUT THAT DOOR!And you know what? Maybe I should! Maybe I *should* be thinking about that door because you know what? When those cops came, who I’ve realized KNEW MY NAME, who SOMEHOW FOUND ME IN THAT DAMN BASEMENT… As we left that basement, it wasn’t just me. 



We were *all* staring at that door.
