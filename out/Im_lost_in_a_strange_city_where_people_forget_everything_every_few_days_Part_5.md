I’m sorry I wasn’t able to update you all yesterday. As you will see reading along, unfortunately my plan to get up and post it at the proper time at which I’ve been allowed by the subreddit lately did not work out as it should’ve, and by the time I was awake, it was mid-afternoon – a time which I did not want to get stuck making the new norm for posting. As a result, I just had to combine today’s and yesterday’s posts together as one, and pick a time that will be more convenient for both me and all of you for posting updates: in this case, 10:00 AM.

I’m sorry again for the inconvenience. Despite most of my time being spent traveling, these past two days have been…interesting to work with.

**Saturday**

**(11:54 AM - 12:17 PM)**

I’ve been lying in bed staring at the ceiling for about a half an hour now, thinking about everything that happened last night, procrastinating on *everything* — including writing out this post. I still don’t know why I feel the way that I do. I really *should* be happy to know that I’m not alone anymore, but something about it just fills me with dread. It’s like I’ve broken an unspoken cardinal rule of this city by bringing someone else into this, even though no one knows it but me, even though it was a complete accident, even though he was already on the brink of reaching that conclusion, anyway.

Maybe it’s the fact that he really *was* on the brink that troubles me. Looking back on everything that Clayton had said last night and re-reading all of our notes for the purpose of getting it all perfectly straight in this post, it’s becoming only more clear to me that there’s no way I can hope to keep him safe by just letting him remain in blissful ignorance of everything that’s going on around him; if I do, he’ll just figure it out eventually anyway, and if he does it alone, I have no way of knowing what he’ll try after that. I have to be there, I have to be the one that reminds him, and I have to make sure he doesn’t try anything crazy. I don’t want to see him become the next victim of whatever’s out there beyond those walls just because he got a little too curious, and no one was there to stop him. 

Apparently, his parents already met a similar fate when he was very young, and old Margaret from the Archives — a family friend, who was still quite old then, I might add, at 63 — had to take him in because he had no other surviving family.

But, I’ll talk about all that in more detail and go over the rest of his writing later. Right now, I’m going to see him. He left me his coat last night so that I’d have a logical reason to stop by his place, and gave me his address. I’m going there with everything we wrote last night, and I’m going to try to explain. He said the coat would be enough for him to want to hear me out. I just hope he’s right.

(4:48 PM - 5:21 PM)

Well, to make a long story short, it worked. I admit, I felt pretty terrible completely destroying his understanding of reality for a second time, and I still can’t help worrying that I’m dooming him in some way by doing it, but what’s done is done, and there’s no going back now — there hasn’t been for awhile.

I’d have updated this sooner, but I’ve been in a bit of a rush after our talk to secure a carriage up north and get some time off from work before nightfall. I decided it was best to just take the week off, which, thankfully, my boss let me have. It’s not a short trip, even by carriage, and I don’t know how long we’re going to actually end up needing to be there, if I have to schedule my visit to their archive like I did here; I’d rather have too *much* time on my hands than too little. Not that I expect to actually *have* that much time with the resets dragging me back every 3-4 days, but at least I’ll have the free time to travel back again, should I need to. 

Clayton is coming with me. It was a bit of an impulse decision, but I asked him to come along. I feel a lot a better about leaving Myosotia if I don’t have to worry what’s happened to him in my absence, and besides, he could prove useful in getting me into the Archives out there, if they happen to remember him. He’s told me he’s been out there in the past, so if nothing else, he might be a helpful guide.

I’m waiting for him now by the carriage, near the northern gates. Once he arrives, we’ll be heading off north, and I’ll hopefully have more time to bring you all up to speed on our conversation last night.

**(7:39 PM - 8:17 PM)**

We’ve been traveling for over two hours now, and won’t be in town until sometime late tomorrow. It’s a bit farther north than the cabin where my “parents” lived, and much farther west, so it will be a long ride. Considering that, if I do have to schedule my visit with their Archive, I’m getting all of that down on paper from whoever I have to go through; that way, if a reset happens before that time, I’ll still be able to go there in the future.

There’s something more ominous about the road tonight that I can’t put into words. Nothing in particular has really changed from the last time I was out here, so maybe it’s just my perception of things that’s different. 

Maybe it’s the fact that I’m riding beside someone whose parents were taken by whatever’s out there, before he was even old enough to have any lasting memories of them.

Even with the curtains fully drawn like this, you can tell that something just…isn’t right outside. It’s always dead silent at night, except for the wind — and I mean *dead* silent, like all other sound has been swallowed up by the shadows. No sound of birds or crickets chirping, no rustling of the grass or the leaves — you can’t even hear the sound of the dirt or rocks outside being disturbed by the carriage itself. You can feel the cabin rock, occasionally tilt from a particularly large stone its wheels pass over on one side or the other, but it’s completely and utterly silent.

I can tell, from the way he keeps glancing at the curtains on his side, that a part of Clayton wants to look outside even more than I do, but I can’t allow that. Not now. Not until we know more. He knows as well as I do that it’s very likely no one has ever looked out those windows at night and still kept their sanity in the process.

I’m going to focus on keeping him company for now, so the temptation doesn’t have any chance of overcoming him. I can always come back to write more once he’s asleep.

**(2:19 AM - 5:40 AM)**

Clayton fell asleep about an hour ago. I’ve been writing and rewriting the email to my Uncle since then.

It’s hard to know what to say to someone in this situation. How much is too much, and how much is too little? The fact that my father hasn’t answered doesn’t inspire much confidence in how well I was believed — if it was even seen at all. 

Sometimes I wonder if there’s even a point. How likely are they, *really*, to open a random email from a new address that likely ended up in their spam filter the moment it’s sent out? Are they looking for me that desperately? Why even would they? Who would suspect that their spam folder is going to contain an email from their missing son who probably vanished in front of them a month ago? And if my father doesn’t, I don’t see any reason why my Uncle would.

I think I just need to take a break from it for awhile. I have to keep a level head. I have to get this right. If I don’t try at all, I’m just throwing my chance away completely. I can’t afford to do that now, even if it is a small one. Everything counts right now.

Maybe after I’ve spent a little time doing something else, I’ll be able to focus better and be a little more positive. He’d definitely be asleep right now, anyway, if time is the same here as it is there. It can wait a few hours.

For now, I’m going to work on bringing you up to speed on everything that happened last night at the hotel. I have all of the old notes and writings here with me, and I even asked him earlier to rewrite a few of the events he still has a clear memory of in more detail for all of you, so I’ll be referring to and even quoting some of those as I go along.

I guess the first thing we should start with is what I mentioned earlier, about his parents, since that’s the event I have the most information about. I don’t know if I’ll be able to get everything down tonight because I do need to rest, but I’m going to try to at least get this part done and then finish it off in tomorrow’s post, since I’ll have nearly all day to do so before we arrive in town.

Like I started to say this morning, when Clayton was just a toddler (around 3 years old, according to his notes), his mother and father left the city walls on foot shortly before dark, never to return. 

Nobody seems to know the reason it happened; according to Clay, all that seems to exist are a few matching eye witness accounts stating that around 5:40 PM, the couple walked up to the gates with their son in their arms, sat him on a nearby bench and told him to wait for “Grammy” (Clay’s nickname for Margaret at the time), and then left.

One woman who was concerned for his well-being came and sat with him until Margaret arrived. 

Margaret maintains that she had been asked to meet them there near evening earlier that morning, so that they could go shopping without having to worry about Clayton; she had no idea that they were planning to leave whatsoever, and they’d seemed their normal selves at the time when they had asked her to do it. And since Clay had no known living relatives, it fell to her to decide to keep him, once it became clear they weren’t coming back.

Clayton told me that the aftermath of his parents’ disappearance was the first time he felt something weird might have been going on here.

“I’ve kept a book at home to help me remember them.” he wrote for me earlier, “I asked Gram (Margaret) about them a lot when I was little, and I’d write down all of the details in there, a bit like we’re doing now with this. I wanted to always be able to picture the people they actually were when I thought of them.

“However, it was strange…the more I inquired with people about them, the more I couldn’t help this uncomfortable feeling in my stomach. I couldn’t quite place what was troubling me back then; I assumed it was simply disappointment that I wasn’t getting as much information as I’d hoped for, and ultimately, I stopped trying. But when I look back at it now, as an adult, I understand what it really was; it wasn’t that they were telling me very little, it was that what they were each truthfully doing was repeating the three precise stories about them that I’d heard so many times, only using slight variations in their wording and the amount of details they’d give. It was as if no one could remember anything else about them, at all, and whenever I’d ask them for more, they’d merely tell me they were sorry, they weren’t very close with my parents. Even Gram will never tell me very much about them in detail. I know she’s growing older, but it’s impossible, isn’t it? She was the one singular person whom I knew was close with them, and she knows so very little that everyone else doesn’t already.”

I’m not sure what all of you are thinking, when you’re finally able to read all of this, but at least to me, it feels a lot like the way I’d describe the way people go about their daily lives here since I arrived: they remember people, sure, but only the people they see frequently enough that it becomes “typical”, and I’m assuming because they forget the individual details of any encounters — like Clayton remembered that I’ve been his server for awhile, but forgot the details of any actual conversations we had — they’re still just left with the most basic descriptions possible if they’re asked to talk about someone they know. 

Does this mean the resets have been going on that long? The worrying part for me is that so much of the rest of what Clayton tells me gives me the impression that the resets are recent, because aside from this incident, his memory has mostly been fine until I got here… So, did it go away for awhile and then come back? Is this something that happens periodically across the eras, and I just happened to get unlucky when I arrived, or is there something I’m not seeing here that I should be?

**Sunday**

**(3:08 PM - 3:21 PM)**

…Well, this is beyond embarrassing. I actually had to go back, clean up, and finish that last paragraph because I fell asleep in the middle of writing it, and only just woke up roughly 20 minutes ago.

I thought it would be obvious I wouldn’t want to sleep this late in the day, but Clayton — who has been wide awake for awhile now, I should add — was absolutely no help to me, anyway, just shrugging and telling me, “Well, you looked exhausted.” *Thanks*, Clay. You’re a real hero for that one.

I was planning to send this post out after I’d finished that part, even if it took me a few more hours (I had to wait until after 8:30 AM to post it, anyway), but since I really would rather not set a new subreddit-required precedence for posting these in the middle of each day, and I don’t think I’m going to have the time to get it done before a reasonable time in the evening as long as I still have to worry about the curtains staying closed, I’m going to just have to wait until sometime *tomorrow* morning to post it. 

*And*, if it isn’t obvious enough from the fact that I fell asleep before I was ever able to take a break from writing to you all so I could get back to it, I still haven’t finished that email to my Uncle, either; after we have a small lunch out of the few things we brought with for the journey, I guess I’ll be getting onto that. 

I still don’t entirely know what direction to go with it, but I can’t keep stalling forever, either. I’m sure I’ll figure something out.

**(4:59 PM - 6:25 PM)**

I finally sent the email out. I’m not exactly confident about it, but at least it’s done, and with an hour to spare before nightfall. Speaking of that, I wonder what they’re going to do if we arrive at the city *after* nightfall; I know in Myosotia, it’s standard practice to wait outside the gates until morning, so I’d have to assume it would be the same here, but the way I was given an estimate of a late evening arrival makes me wonder if that’s actually the case. 

I suppose we’ll find out.

For the time being, I want to use what little daylight I have left to try to finish telling you all everything I learned from Clayton the other night — about why and how he came to suspect something was wrong with everyone’s memories, and the strange things he’s seen happen.

I apologize if this reads as slightly more in a hurry than usual, but an hour isn’t nearly as long as I’d like when going over these sorts of things, and I’d prefer not to have to stop in the middle of it again. I can always go into greater detail (or ask Clayton to give me more detail, if I don’t have more at the moment) in the future if any of you want to know more specifics than I’ve given.

As I said, the way people spoke about his parents was just the beginning: he hasn’t mentioned any other notable oddities yet that happened before I arrived, no, but there have been plenty *afterward*.

It was small things, at first; details such as finding a pen or another object in a place he didn’t remember leaving it in his house and couldn’t imagine ever doing on purpose, waking in his bed early in the morning with all of the lights still on in the house, or waking up and realizing he must’ve forgotten his coat at work or another place he usually frequented, and then having to go get it — the sort of things you might easily just attribute to being exhausted from a long day at work, or, at the very most, in the case of the former two, some sort of haunting.

Over time, though, things started to happy that made him start to question his sanity: 

Visits to friends’ houses would occasionally result in him waking up with objects they’d let him borrow still in his possession, which he’d awkwardly have to return — though, he notes, they seemed strangely unbothered by it and accepted it happening, in the same way as he usually had just casually accepted things being moved from their usual places, and would even make up excuses for why he might have done it, until he began to feel crazy for thinking it was strange.

He would sometimes have trouble bringing to mind what exactly he’d done the day before, if it differed a lot from his usual schedule.

He’d sometimes vaguely recall going to certain places to get things on his shopping lists, but find that despite crossing the items off, he left without getting any of what he’d gone there for, and, to make matters worse, if the stop wasn’t a part of his usual schedule, no one would remember him having been there, either, making him start to doubt if even had, and how, if he hadn’t, the items had ended up crossed off on his list, when he clearly didn’t have them.

And then, particularly, there was the one instance which he says was the final breaking point to him wondering if there was something larger going on:

For important context, it had been raining for about five days prior to my first post on this subreddit; because it had lasted for almost two resets, we had *all* gotten used to the rain,  — so even your average forgetful citizen had learned through the frequent repetition and developed schedule that seems to work so well for them that they should better than to go out each day without *at least* an umbrella or a rain resistant coat of some manner. Reset or no reset, everyone knew about the rain.

With that in mind, by the time the reset happened on the day of my first post, Clayton had still been at the Archives and had long since taken off his jacket and umbrella and left it by the door, for when it was time to leave. Obviously, though, when the reset hit and he finally woke up, he was already back in his bed at home. That’s simply how it works here, no matter what.

And, it was because of that that he finally couldn’t fully ignore the impossibility of what had just happened, no matter how much anyone else might have acted like it didn’t need so much consideration. When he got to the door to get ready to leave, he immediately realized that not only had he somehow left his jacket and umbrella *at the Archives* while it was pouring rain outside, but he had also managed to walk home *without them*, without his suit, socks, or shoes getting wet at all in any way — despite the fact that, even by his own reminders left on the counter, it was going to have been pouring outside all day, *especially* around the time he would have been coming home, and it was still drizzling slightly by the morning. 

All of that was still fresh on his mind by the time that I met him and reminded him of the conversation that he’d forgotten having, and apparently that and my apparent interest in reading about strange cases of people with amnesia was the last push it took to fully convince him that he needed to find answers. He apparently immediately went home and got the book that he’d written in about his parents, documented the umbrella incident and my conversation with him in the back, then went back to the archive with it in tow and started searching the records for any proof of anyone experiencing the things he had, something he might have overlooked when he was gathering the books for me. He’d apparently gone through about five shelves worth of books by the time I found him the next night, and had even come to discover that for some reason, there’s no record of most of his other family members that he knows he had in the books whatsoever. 

That’s one of the reasons he wants to come with while I research mine; he wants to see if all of my family members have a clear “paper trail”, so to speak, or if at some point my family just seems to vanish from the records like his does.

I don’t know what that could possibly mean, other than that some people are so unremarkable or make so few connections that they tend to be forgotten because of the resets erasing their short term encounters with others, but I intend to get to the bottom of it one way or another.

Unfortunately, though, for now, I have to sign off. It’s already past nightfall, and I need to make sure I keep Clayton company. He seems to be less focused on the outdoors tonight. I’m glad of that. I want to keep it that way.

**(10:18 PM - 10:22 PM)**

We finally arrived at the city — Hortens, it’s called, and an odd name for a city, at that, I think, when it sounds so much like a name you’d give to a human of some bygone era; strangely, it seems that unlike Myosotia, this place actually has a system working to accept carriages inside after dark. I didn’t get to observe it firsthand, of course, as we couldn’t open the curtains until we were inside the city walls, but I’m told they have an outer wall and second gate for the “docking bay” (my words, not theirs), where the carriage is to arrive and the second gate is to be closed behind it, before it is allowed to proceed through the main gates and enter. 

I wish they had this back in Myosotia. It’s so much more convenient. We’re walking to a hotel now, to try to book a room. With any luck, we’ll be unpacked and ready to rest within the hour.

**(11:05 PM - 11:08 PM)**

We’re unpacked in the room. I was about to sleep and set an alarm for 10:00 to post this (I reasonable time for posting from now on, I think), when I went to check my email, and realized I had a reply from father:

“I miss you, Michael.”

That was it, just these four words. Nothing else. Why isn’t there more? Why doesn’t he sound more frantic, more excited, more….*anything*? Why doesn’t ask where I am? Why doesn’t he seem desperate to find me? How do I even respond to that?

…I need to go to bed. I’ve been pacing the room for the past 10 minutes, just trying to understand. I was going to wait until the next post to even mention it because I know this post is long enough, but I need to know what all of you think about it. I’m so confused.
