The phone alarm I'd set last night blared so loud it shook me from my wonderful dreams straight back into reality and almost on the floor as I struggled in that half-awake state to keep myself from falling off the bed. I groaned in annoyance and defeat, stopping it, and it took all the strength I had to lift myself off the pillow and sit on the edge of the mattress, rubbing my eyes. I didn't get enough sleep for what was coming.

I was startled when a shirt covered my head, reaching for it quickly and then looked to the wardrobe in the hallway, the view to which was obscured by my roommate Anthony who'd already put the bottoms of his scrubs on but was still wearing the tank top he slept with. He was brushing his teeth and took the brush out to speak to me, some toothpaste dribbling down the corner of his mouth as he did.

"That's your third alarm man, hurry up and get dressed. We've been waiting for this all week, can't afford making a bad first impression, yeah?"

He was right, both of us have been very serious about impressing our attendings during rotations, as it can only bring you good things in the future, and here I am risking the coming days just for five more minutes of sleep. I remember how bad me and Anthony had started off in first year, almost getting into a fight that one time, but here we are in fourth now, roommates, best friends, and always hyping each other up, watching our backs. I could say pretty safe now that I'd trust this guy with my life.

Within ten minutes, Anthony and I were in the elevator, heading for the bus station. I was rubbing the sleep away from my eyes still when I spoke.

"What did you say the attending's name was? Michaels?"

"Michaels is next," Anthony began. "Sawyer is the one. Get your head together already, man. Need you at your hundred for this."

"Sorry, sorry... I just didn't sleep good."

I bought myself a coffee that I downed quickly before the bus had even arrived, and the drive was just short of fifteen minutes. Despite me sleeping in a bit, we arrived early again, though I knew Anthony wouldn't let us oversleep. He's much better at this getting up early stuff than I am.

We walked a bit before reaching the hospital, and at its entrance we already saw some of our colleagues, who I must add, don't get along with us very well, or they'd say the same about us, so we just enjoyed the silence in each other's company until we got the call to go in.

Skipping over the boring details of waiting on the rest of the group, about half an hour later there were eight of us under Dr. Sawyer - a fifty-something, white-haired, slightly hunched man with glasses and a neatly trimmed mustache.

"Good morning everybody," Sawyer started while flipping over various notes on a clipboard. "You'll have to excuse the hasty introduction, but the ward is incredibly busy and we have lots of work to do. You all know me already, and I will get to know you when you make your first stop by me one by one, once I finish touring you around." He remained silent for a few moments as he scratched away on one of the notes with a bright red pen, then cleared his throat. "I will lead you around the rooms with patients in them and we'll skip over the empty ones, then you can choose which patient, or patients if you're feeling up to it, you would like to aid us with. Now follow me."

I overheard two of the women in my group whispering to each other about how unapproachable Dr. Sawyer appeared from this introduction and huffed. Anthony would constantly tease me about it and makes jokes, but I always found the stern and direct teachers and attendings more likable and realistic than sweet-talkers. So far, I had no reason to make negative assumptions about him, but I reckoned he is serious about his work.

Admittedly with how fast we were all moving and how big of a group we were, we probably looked like disoriented flies wondering where to fly next in contrast to the ward's busy rooms and hallways. We'd step over each other, bump shoulders and whisper as Dr. Sawyer led us from room to room telling us about the patients in contrast to the staff's organized movement and activity. The air smelled of antiseptic and beyond the open door of some rooms I could see patients and nurses talking, laughing, watching TV or enjoying a book on their own. Like he'd already said, it really was busy here. I wondered if I'd even have a moment where I wouldn't see another face at all with all these people around.

Dr. Sawyer told us about the old lady in room 412 who'd fallen down the stairs a few days ago, about the apprehended delinquent in 413 that had his arm broken trying to run from the police, and the young boy in 415 with his broken leg after football practice, but he'd skipped 414, the door to which had been slightly cracked open and I glimpsed a woman with shoulder-length hair facing away and out the window from her bed. Attendings are people too, though, so it wasn't strange, though maybe a little weird how a doctor might forget their patient...

It was half an hour after the tour was concluded when Anthony and I were grabbing a can of soda and some chocolate bars from one of the vending machines while chatting about who we wanted to "claim".

"Thinking about the geezer with the fake leg, I'm sure the man could use some laughter while learning how to walk at like, what, 70? 170?" Andrew sipped from his soda and smirked.

"I'm sure he's not going to find it funny if you say he's over a century and a half old in front of him, dude." I shook my head and continued, "Anyway, I was thinking about the boy in 415, you know, with the broken leg... and now that I remembered, didn't you see that girl? In 414?"

Anthony smeered his entire mouth in chocolate trying to take a single bite from his bar and murmured, "Nuh-uh. Didn't mister doc skip over that one?"

"He did," I nodded, "but I saw someone in there. Looked like a young girl."

"So go get her player."

"Shut up. You're still talking like you're 20."

"Hey, I just like you. Not as much anymore, though, after this."

We threw some banter in between our conversation for a little longer before both of us split again. I'd already passed by Dr. Sawyer and told him I'd most probably take the boy in 415, but I'm sure he wouldn't mind if I changed my decision. He didn't note us down or anything so I thought nothing of it, and started making my way to 414.

Still standing in the corridor outside the room, I took two seconds to look through the still cracked open door and saw the woman was in the same position I'd first seen her. Though I knocked audibly enough I'm sure, she made no effort to turn and face me, I allowed myself in, stepping just inside and clearing my throat with a second set of knocks which worked to draw her attention.

I'm a little shy to admit that I was immediately smitten by her beauty. Her hair was blond to the point of golden, her facial features perfectly aligned and her eyes were so delicate it was as if she was caressing me with just her sight. Her face turned from a confused frown to a friendly smile, likely when she registered the green scrubs I was wearing, letting her recognize me as staff.

"Excuse me, miss, I don't mean to bother you," I began, "I'm a student on rotation."

She nodded and waved me over faintly, then spoke with one of the most gentle voices I'd heard.

"Please, come in. You are not bothering anyone."

I smiled so wide I was glad to have a mask covering my face right then. She was so pretty, and I could tell Anthony was going to make fun of me and be all 'I told you so' when I tell him about her.

"I'm a student on rotation, I wanted to meet you and, if you're comfortable, learn about why you are here."

"Absolutely, that's no problem at all." She gestured to the chair by her bed and I sat facing her. I wanted to take my mask off, but stopped in the middle of lifting my arm up to do so and let her continue speaking. "My name is Melissa, it's nice to meet you."

"The pleasure is mine, miss Meli-"

"Just Melissa, please." She shined that beautiful smile again and brushed some hair away from her forehead. Damn, is all that intentional from her or what?

"Right, Melissa, I'm Luke. Just Luke, please." We both shared a lighthearted laugh. "How old are you, if I may ask? Why are you in here?"

"Oh, I actually just had my twenty-sixth birthday two weeks ago, and the doctors are keeping me here until I recover from birth. I had my sweet little boy just two days ago."

"Ah, congratulations Melissa. I'm happy for you, and I'm sure you're excited to be with your son. What's his name? Where is he now?"

"Thank you, Luke. Well, it wasn't the easiest of births, and he was a little sickly. They are making sure he is okay enough to the point where being near each other isn't a risk to either of us."

I nodded along and smiled while she spoke, but a question rose in my head, and it was that this isn't the type of ward to handle these medical situations.

"But why are they keeping you in this ward?"

"The hospital's full, they had to move me because I wasn't in emergency need of any treatment or medication."

I lifted a brow but hummed in agreement. That makes it even stranger that Dr. Sawyer skipped her room when she isn't even supposed to be here. It's a bit difficult to forget that if you ask me.

I felt the lack of sleep get to me as a light headache ruined the sweetness of the conversation and made me groan quietly. I excused myself and returned the chair to its previous position, making my way to the door of 414. Before going out I turned to Melissa again.

"I have to go now, but I'll be back a bit later and I'll get you some food. You need to stay well fed post birth, I'm sure you've been told."

"That's not necessary," she started, "But it's very kind of you. Don't worry about me, Luke."

Exiting the room, I took in after shutting the door just how lively everything really was right outside. So much talking, footsteps, carts, systems, yet inside the room I couldn't hear any of it. It didn't strike me as odd right then though.

I did come back to Melissa some short time later, giving her a bottle of water and a tray of food - some salad and a desert, as from the way she put it she wouldn't eat much anyway, but when I returned to her room for the third time I didn't expect to see it completely untouched, right there on the table I'd left it, not moved an inch.

"You're not hungry even a little?" I inquired, going to adjust her IV stand, seeing that the fluid bag was completely empty.

"No, Luke. Thank you, really, I just want to sit and rest a while longer. Is it a problem?"

I spoke back while unhooking the bag. "Not at all of course, just concerned. And I need to get you a new infusion. Can you show me your arm, please?"

Melissa nodded and pulled out both her arms from under the blanket, and I was surprised to see she had no IV. Maybe this was from before? No, she's still recovering, she needs it. It made no sense.

"Where's your IV? Did the doctors take it out?"

She looked at me, expression as puzzled as mine, and then that sharp headache hit me again, worse than last time. I squinted and held my free hand up to my forehead, rubbing my temples. I decided then that I'd get some painkillers for myself, along with a new bag and IV line for Melissa. I told her I'd be back in a few moments and exited the room.

Silence.

Total, unnerving silence.

The hospital was just as brightly lit as before I'd come in, floors so clean you could see your reflection in them, sunlight seeping in through the windows, yet not a soul to be heard. Not a face in sight.

Had lunch break come already? But even then, how could so many people go all at once? They wouldn't even fit in the cafeteria. I walked around, expecting to see someone just around every corner, but it was like I was the only person the entire building. When I went into one of the staff rooms, there were no other nurses, no janitors, no doctors.

My face burned hot and my breaths shot in and out of my chest. I started speed-walking down the halls again, calling for Anthony, for Dr. Sawyer, for any of my colleagues, yet nobody replied but the echo of my own voice, like I was in a cave, when suddenly:

"Luke?"

It was the distant voice of Melissa, coming from the hallway of her room. I turned and full on ran towards it, almost bumping into her as she turned the corner into the main corridor.

"Melissa? Why are you up? Where is everyone?"

She held her hands clutched to her chest and looked past and around me, then ignored my question.

"What's going on? Is something wrong?"

"It... it damn feels like it. I can't find anyone."

Melissa and I traversed the entire ward more times than I could count, even allowing ourselves to walk into other patients' rooms uninvited. They were all empty, beds made, floors, tables and windows clean. The entire building looked even more untouched. Hell, it was.

"Oh dear God." Melissa blurted out behind me, making me jump. I turned to look at her. "My baby, where is my baby?"

She was looking at me as if I knew the answer. Truth be told, the fact I was technically staff, and did not, made it all the more horrifying for me.

I reached out a comforting hand to her shoulder and I could see her eyes water as she realized I could not tell her what she wanted to know.

"We're going to figure this out, okay? There's a phone in the nurses' room, let's try that. We'll find everyone else and we'll make sure your baby is okay."

Melissa nodded frantically and hastily followed as I made my way into the eerily empty space that had my best friend and colleagues just minutes ago. I dialed Anthony and as more and more rings went through a hole opened in my stomach, growing deeper with each tone.

Nobody was going to pick up.

I tried again, this time trying to call other friends, but again, nobody was picking up, and the entire time Melissa would, out of nowhere, beg me to reach someone and help find her son.

I hate to admit it but I slammed the phone hard enough for the whole table to shake, causing Melissa to gasp and take a step back. I knew it was not her fault, acting like this, but it only made the situation that much worse for me. Keeping my arms supporting me on the desk, I took a deep breath and held my eyes shut, trying to think of any logical explanation for all this, which I of course, could not find.

"I... I'm sorry, Melissa, just... damn it, I have no idea what's going on."

"What about the other wards? Let's go and ask someone, they can't all have left us, right?"

Left us? Why would they leave us?

"Yeah... yeah, okay. Come with me."

We walked through the empty halls, the smell of antiseptic still strong, but once again no one was around to fill the void of so much space. It didn't matter, though - I knew that once we get to any of the other wards, we'd find so many people there that would give us a plausible reason for why we were suddenly all alone in here, and we'd all laugh and I'd have to explain to Dr. Sawyer why I startled a patient and led them to the nurses' station...

Except none of that was going to happen.

We walked for longer than it should have taken us to realize that no matter how many corners we turned, how many steps we'd taken, there was no exit door. We had passed through the same hallways a few times now, and even by Melissa's and the nurses' rooms a handful of times without even noticing.

We were walking in circles.

And with each turn I started noticing the hospital deteriorate around us. Windows and walls became filthier and stained, doors were showing signs of wood rot, rooms cracked open to let out a bad stench.

Both Melissa and I were in full panic mode by then and had started running, making the changes come even faster. There were overturned chairs, peeled walls and broken lamps, and in mere minutes it was like I was in a totally different hospital - one not full of life and work, but of something sinister. Something that couldn't be real.

I felt like I was about to lose consciousness at any given moment, my legs felt weak and the blood in my head was pulsing so hard I thought my skull would burst. Again, I let my emotions get the better of me:

I don't know how many loops of the hallways we'd made by now, but at some point Melissa had started calling out, as if expecting there to be more life in what looked like an abandoned drug den more than it resembled the hospital we were in.

"Please, is anybody there? Where is Shaun? Where is my baby?"

After hearing one of those questions repeated for what I felt was the hundredth time, I stopped and grabbed one of the toppled chairs, screaming and throwing it against the wall. Melissa, too, screamed in response and pulled back, curling into herself as I pushed myself against the other end of the hallway and slid down, laying my head in my lap and trying not to cry myself. I was scared. Very, very scared.

This is not possible.

Melissa had suddenly become uncharacterisitcally silent, and when I turned to face her, my eyes surely watery and red, she gasped and took a step back. It made me realize how unhinged I look from her point of view, and I let a tear roll down my cheek before wiping it away, standing up and speaking to her before approaching, having already freaked her out enough.

"I'm sorry, Melissa... I don't know what's going on. But we'll figure it out, okay? We're going to be fine and, and we'll find your son." She seemed to ease her guard and with a sob of her own, nodded to my statement. "We'll find Shaun."

"Wh- what are we going to do, Luke? Where are we? Everything is so..." She scanned the rotting walls of the hallway, afraid to even speak the word. "...dead."

I struggled to find an appropriate response as I, too, was running out of ideas. There was only one place I could think for us to go and check out that may have something to help us, but even that was a far reach.

"I don't know what state it is in now considering the whole hospital is... dead, as you put it. But maybe Dr. Sawyer's office could have a phone, or, or..." I couldn't find any other possibility, anything else that could let us reach someone.

Luckily Melissa didn't let me finish and nodded, her footsteps much quieter and more distant now, walking further behind me... I couldn't blame her.

The door to the doctor's room was just as decrepit as the rest of this building by now, and I'm not sure why I felt so much disappointment when I entered and he was nowhere to be found. A tiny part of me was hoping for a miracle, but of course, that would be too good to be true.

The office was spacious. What must have been a colorful patterned carpet was now torn and dirty, covering about half the room's size. There was a large bookshelf with tons of folders, on his desk lay scattered papers and books. A cushioned chair was slid under it in the leg room, and he had a large TV mounted on the wall with a couch by the bookshelf and a coffee table between them. Right by the desk there was a door, which I opened to see that it was a closet, though there was nothing inside.

Melissa stayed at the door, keeping it slightly cracked open and peering outside as if afraid someone was watching us. Honestly, that would feel like a blessing right now.

I went through the drawers of his desk and through all his paperwork, hoping to find anything that might hint at what's going on or magically find us our way out. You could guess how that turned out.

My last idea was to look at the bookshelf. The folders were all dated, and on the top row there were ten of them spanning the last ten years. I grabbed the most recent one and started flipping through each of the document sections inside. They were various papers for the given patient. I skipped forward a little and found the patients around Melissa's room - the old lady, the delinquent, the football boy, and for some reason I left her section for last.

The moment I flipped her file open was when a dreadful thought creeped into my mind and I slowly turned my head towards her, expecting her to already be looking at me like in a horror movie, but no - she was still looking outside the office.

Why did everybody in the hospital but me and Melissa disappear?

I shelved the question for a while longer and opened her file. It was dated two months ago, was incredibly short, and even had what I thought would be a release date.

The same date when she was admitted.

My distrust grew more and more, I shot a quick glance at the woman and then back to the file, hoping she hadn't seen me. Finally, with a deep breath, I began reading.

*Young woman, 26, taken in after painful contractions in the middle of the night. Call made by parents, SO not present or mentioned. Patient unfortunately passed during childbirth. The baby, a boy, was stillborn. Parents contacted.*

I must have reread the entry at least three times. The entry that claims Melissa had passed in childbirth, yet here she was, standing a few feet away from me, trapped in what feels like a circle of Hell itself.

"Luke?" My head jerked to the door where Melissa was looking at me with the same nervous expression, hands once more clutched to her chest. "Did you find anything?"

I couldn't tell what I was feeling at that moment. Dread, yes. Fear, sure. But anger, too. My blood was boiling. I was alive - I knew it for certain. I woke up that morning, in my room with my best friend throwing me a shirt and scolding me to get ready. I took that damn bus to this hospital and I spoke to Dr. Sawyer. I was alive, and more than halfway ready to save lives myself. This woman there, this witch - she must be responsible for what is happening to me. And she is not meant to be alive.

She is dead.

I tore her file off from the folder and threw it at her. She flinched and cowered in the corner.

"You're scaring me!" She yelled, her breaths hitching and her eyes tearing up.

"Read it."

I didn't move. I stared at her as she sheepishly reached for the file and sobbed while reading - until she stopped.

"No..."

She looked up at me, her eyes still producing tears but it was like she failed to register the crying.

"You're not real. You weren't from the start. You're the reason I'm in here."

"No, Luke, I don't know what this is!" She stood up, looking at the file again and taking a step closer to me.

"Stay the hell away! What even are you? I'm not gonna let you hurt me!" I kicked the table forward a little, which to my surprise did not deter her.

"Please, I don't know what's going on, Luke. I'm just as scared as you are... and my son-"

"Your son is dead, just like you should be. You're nothing, Melissa - you're a demon! A ghost!"

My accusations were like knives, each word cutting into her and making her crying more hysterical, but when I mentioned her son she stopped.

Melissa looked at the paper again and let it fall from her hand. She tried to wipe her cheeks, but they were soaked mere moments later again. In that instance I didn't see a witch or a demon, or whatever else was going through my head at the time. I saw a broken woman, alone and afraid.

But that couldn't be the case. It made no sense.

And my suspicion was confirmed by what happened next.

"I'm not... dead." Her voice was so faint I could barely make out what she said, and I almost didn't hear it properly, because something else caught my eye - as she spoke, one of her teeth fell out.

I watched it in horror as it dropped on the ground - it was long and sharp, almost definitely a canine from what I could tell where I was standing. I stared at it a moment and took a step back.

When I looked up at her again, she'd already changed so much - her hair was thinner, and her face looked like she had just lost half her weight in the span of a second.

The sight of her tooth and sudden physical changes made me gag. Her breath caught while she tried to speak through the tears and gasps.

"Luke, I'm so scared." She continued approaching me, her arms held out as if attempting to grab onto me. "And my son-"

Fear took over me. The hospital that couldn't exist, the fact that everyone was missing, the rapid change of Melissa's appearance, it was too much to bear-

I grabbed her by the shoulders and threw her back.

She stumbled over herself trying to keep her balance, spinning around midair and I heard a loud thud and crunching sound as she fell onto the floor, hitting her head against the coffee table.

Melissa lay there motionless and I felt my own breath hitch too, my throat burning and my entire body trembling by what I had just done - I don't know if I even meant to.

She moved her left arm slowly, then her right, and pushed herself up, making a painfully slow, horrifying attempt to look at me - it was like watching a puppet on strings.

There was a giant gash where she'd hit her head, oozing blood that had already covered half her face. Her hair had a patch completely torn, with some of it sticking on her blood. She stood up, accompanied by the disgusting sound of cracking as her knees moved.

Her gaze met mine - broken, afraid, confused. Her left eye remained shut due to the injury and blood, and she could barely make a step toward me. Despite that, she continued, approaching me so slow, her arms outstretched the same, as if expecting a different outcome - as if I hadn't just done what I did.

"Please, Luke... my baby..."

I couldn't move. Couldn't reply.

With each step Melissa began decomposing more and more. Her teeth fell out seconds apart from each other, one by one. Her skin grew tighter over her bones and the wound on her head seemed to be getting bigger. Blood had soaked all her clothing by now, her knees started shaking and I could see she was giving it her all to keep herself standing. How she could even walk was unexplainable.

Then, a crack, and her right leg gave in, Melissa's entire weight came crashing down onto the floor, the elbow of her arm taking the most damage. It popped as soon as she hit the ground and I saw it twist at an angle it shouldn't be able to.

It caused me to snap out and move, my back hitting the closet door behind me.

Melissa's cries grew louder and more desperate. She was dragging herself across the floor now, using only one arm and one leg, and left a trail of blood, hair and skin where she'd been. The whole time she was trying to speak through her weeping.

"Save him, Luke..."

She lifted her head from the floor to face me.

I was met with almost half of an exposed skull, patches of sinew and muscle barely holding on, while the other side of her face was so sunken it was like looking at a mummified corpse. I could see no tears from all the blood.

Blindly reaching behind me, my palm danced against the closet door until it found the handle. I pushed it open and ran inside, shutting it and putting my entire weight against it.

Melissa crawled and crawled for what felt like an eternity, begging me through gargles and yelps to find her child, then she finally reached the closet door. She weakly pushed and banged against it. Three times was all she had the strength left for.

She inhaled as deep as she could and spoke, or tried to, as much as her vocal cords had the possibility to anymore.

*"My baby... please..."*

I heard one final thud, this time on the floor, and silence blanketed the outside of the closet.

After I could no longer hear her I could not hold myself back and vomited, picturing the gruesome sight that would await me when I come out.

I don't know how long I stayed inside. The smell of both rot and my own guts made me that much sicker, but the adrenaline kept me from fainting. Finally, gathering the courage and strength, I pushed hard against the door, but flew out and almost fell over myself.

There was nothing.

Melissa's file, the coffee table, everything was as I left it after... after what happened. But there was no body, no blood.

But the stench remained.

I ventured out into the hallway, and once I'd started to calm down the reality of what I'd just witnessed began setting in. I was disturbed, terrified, and alone. The only other person that was with me, if she was even real, was Melissa. Now she is gone too. I walked back to room 414 hoping to find her in the middle of its rotten remains, as pretty and welcoming as I'd seen her when I first entered it, but it was as empty as everything else.

My next stop was the nurses' station.

Empty.

I stood in the center of the room, staring into the wall, and then released all my emotions in a single scream that lasted so long I couldn't find my voice after it. Tears rolled from my eyes, snot from my nose, saliva from my mouth. I didn't know what to do. I was lost.

I approached the phone once more, dialing Anthony's number.

*Ring. Ring. Ring. Ring. Ring.*

No one answered.
