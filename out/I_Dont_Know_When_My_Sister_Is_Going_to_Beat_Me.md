I was five years old when a stranger came to my house and took me into the back of their car. They took me to the hospital, and a bunch of strangers talked to me. They were on the phone for a couple of minutes. Apparently, I had a sister named Cassie. I never knew I had a sister. I asked the strangers why I was going to live with her. They said, “She’s of age. She’s 21 years old and can take care of you.”

We drove to her house. I didn’t know how far the drive was, but I fell asleep during it. Cassie was at the door smiling when we arrived. I walked in, trembling, while Cassie grabbed my hand and led me to the bathroom. Whenever my daddy took me to the bathroom, it usually meant I was going to get punished. But Cassie got a towel and pajamas.

For some reason, I was never allowed to bathe, shower, or wear pajamas at my mom and dad’s house. There was a big bathtub, and she turned on the water. She was talking softly as it filled. I saw her long fake nails tapping on the edge of the tub. I didn’t understand what she was doing, so I ran for it. I tried to leave the bathroom, but she turned off the water and grabbed me again, locking the door behind her.

I started banging on the door. I heard the water stop running. Cassie said, “Come over here. We’re going to get all clean. Come on, Sarah.” She undressed me and put me in the warm water. As she scrubbed me, she washed my hair. Layers and layers of dirt came off. I asked her why she was doing it because I didn’t understand. She wrapped me in a towel, took me out, and drained the bathtub.

I started crying. She shushed me gently and began putting clothes on me. Then she took me to the kitchen. The only time I got to eat before was when Mom put food on the floor and I had to lick it off, or when I earned it. I wondered why Cassie was taking me there. She asked what I wanted to eat. I just stayed quiet, thinking it was a trap. I thought it was something to get me punished.

Cassie started making spaghetti. When she gave me a plate, I accidentally peed in my brand-new pajamas. I knew if I had done that at home, I would’ve gotten the hairbrush. Cassie said, “That’s okay. We just have to clean it up.” She took me to the bathroom again, took off my pants, wiped me off, and put a diaper on me. It was so embarrassing. Then she said, “There we go. That’s a lot better. This will keep you clean.”

She cleaned off the kitchen chair and let me eat. She rubbed my back. I didn’t know why she was doing that or what punishment was coming. After I finished eating, she said, “It’s getting late. We’re going to bed.”

I was never allowed to sleep in a bed before. I had to sleep on a trash bag in the garage. Cassie took me to a room with a big bed. She put me in it, then climbed in beside me and turned off the lights.

After about twenty minutes, she fell asleep. I looked around for a way out, scared about what would happen. My parents never treated me the way Cassie was treating me. I thought it was all a setup for a beating. I finally fell asleep.

When I woke up, Cassie was lying on her side with her arm stretched out and the blanket over her. I was inches from her. I stayed still, knowing I was going to get beaten in the morning.

Cassie woke up around seven and told me good morning. She took me to the bathroom, grabbed some clothes, and undressed me. The wipes she used were cold. She put on a new diaper, then a brand-new dress and leggings. I stood still, confused. At my parents’ house, I would go days without changing my clothes, and that was always fine. Why did I have to change here? It didn’t make sense.

She took me to the kitchen and poured a bowl of cereal. I was never allowed to eat cereal before. I watched her, wondering why she was letting me eat. She fed me cereal and gave me milk.

Then she took me to the living room. I sat there, shaking and silent. She turned on a movie. I was never allowed to watch movies. She asked, “Do you want to watch Cinderella with me, Sarah?” I stayed quiet, just looking at her. She turned it on anyway and sat me on her lap. I didn’t know what to do, so I fell asleep, certain she would beat me later.

When I woke up, the movie was over. She gave me a little squeeze and asked if I’d ever had McDonald’s before. I said no because I didn’t know what that was. She smiled and told me to get in the car.

At the restaurant, she ordered chicken nuggets for me. It came with a toy. She got a hamburger and fries and gave me some of her fries. I didn’t know why she was giving them to me. I spilled my milk, panicking because I knew that would mean a beating. I ran and hid under the bed.

I heard Cassie calling, “Sarah, Sarah, where are you? I’m not going to hurt you!” That’s exactly what my mom used to say before she beat me. I stayed hidden until I felt the bed move. Cassie found me and gently pulled me out. She told me it was okay and that I shouldn’t hide from her again.

Why didn’t she want me to hide? She took me to the bathroom again, changed me, and wiped me off. Then she gave me some toys. I was never allowed to play with toys before. My parents always said they were for spoiled kids. But Cassie let me play. I was terrified she would do something, but she didn’t.

I kept wondering why she was doing all of this—and when she was finally going to beat me.

At dinner, she made spaghetti again. Afterward, she gave me another bath, put on clean clothes and a diaper, and tucked me into bed beside her. She lay there quietly and said, “Tomorrow will be a better day.”

I knew that meant I was going to get beaten tomorrow.

When is Cassie going to beat me?
And why isn’t she?
This isn’t what’s supposed to happen.
My parents would have always beaten me.
