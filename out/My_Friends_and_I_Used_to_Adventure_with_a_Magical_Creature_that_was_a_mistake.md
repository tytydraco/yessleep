Boarding up this house, my last stand, to protect myself I had this funny thought: all this hate was once love.

The fruit of Omertà’s hatred for me rotted outside. Rain splashing from the sky pet Mr. Alan’s corpse making his broken and snapped neck wiggle and dance as if worms infected his body. Medical professionals would say it would be impossible for his neck to be squeezed and twisted in such a way, a cartoonishly evil wringing like a wet towel. However, that’s the power of Omertà.  Benni, one of my best friends, lay beside her dead daddy; her skin drained of color, her body dripping from drowning, and her lips open and begging for the air she didn’t receive. Again, Omertà’s handy work. 

Omertà was my best friend for ten years. She was Benni’s for even longer.  Omertà came into my life and made everything better, including school. If I had an issue with somebody, Omertà handled it. She wouldn't tell me how. For now, let's say she made them a shadow of themselves.

Regardless, no one bullied me anymore. My school days blurred, easily forgettable for years and my after-school activities were epic, the type of adventures you should write on stone tablets so they could always be remembered.

A couple of weeks ago you would have been jealous of my life, I spent my school years adventuring in impossibility, living a life every kid who ever obsessed over the books of Narnia, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, would give up their ability to read for. I joined the Big Three—that's Omertà, Little John, and Benni—and made it into the Big Four.

The four of us would go on to be legends; ask anyone.

Ask your local dwarf who stopped the elves of the Carolinas from abusing them. Ask the gremlins who fought the dragons they brought to Earth. What about the Farmers who protected their herds from giants and solved the mystery of the Crawling Bat?

It would be cool if my first time writing of our adventures would be about any of that. No, unfortunately, I have to tell you about how it all ended. The end is the most honest part anyway. Word of advice: if a supernatural creature befriends you and asks you to travel with them through the Green Back Alleys of Earth be careful. Understand your friends will treat you as well as they treat their enemies one day, okay? More on that later.

Evil and gore won my night in the end but I planned for it to be special and full of love for my friends. That night, we would celebrate my twenty-first birthday. By the American definition, I became a man. So, I had to start acting like it, standing up for myself and all that. How would I do that? I decided I would drink for the first time with my friend Little John and tell Benni how I felt about her. 

After finishing my homework for college, I ran a nice bath. After running the bath, I donned my best suit and black loafers, and then I shaved the little mustache that sprouted on my lips. Reader, I am not stupid. The bath just wasn't for me to bathe in.

Without prompting from me, the water bubbled as if it was boiling, so I hurried with my shaving.

Speaking of spray, I put on about eight spritzes too many of a cologne Omertà got me. The smell was cool and gave that woodsman vibe. But its real advantage was that it was from a Fae group, so it placed a little glamour on me. I could look younger, older, bigger, thinner, chubby-cheeked, or perfect-jawed—whatever the woman beside me wanted to see.

The bath writhed and spit. Omertà was summoning me and I guessed she was getting impatient. Rushing, I went into my bathroom dresser and took out a special bottle disguised as mouthwash. I used the cap as a shot glass and tried to guestimate how much to pour myself of ambrosia, the drink of the gods.  It was my first time drinking and I knew it could be intense so I didn’t want to overdo it. I should have chosen a weaker drink.

The bathtub water flicked and boiled, and panicking I poured a swig. It trickled down my throat like water.

My vision turned into a hazy circus, my spine tingling, and my face grinning. I normally walked into the bathtub to get transported, but this time I took two sloppy steps and fell face-first in the tub.

The water wasn't boiling, but it was hot. My skin roared. As I fell face-first and let the water overwhelm me, my world turned. Flipping upside-down, I stood dry and safe on a street in the Green Back Alleys of Earth, the place where the supernatural congregate.

In a stream in the street, Omertà swam and leaped out, her mermaid fins immediately turning into legs.

"Jay-Jay, come on," she begged. "We're late."

"I'm... a... come on," I said, slurring and happy thanks to the ambrosia.

Omertà stunned in her short green dress. Her golden eyes blinked at me twice. It’s odd I never saw her as more than a friend despite her beauty, maybe there was always something to frightening about her.

"Are you drunk?" she asked drunkenly.

"No..." I lied drunkenly. "You are."

We smiled in silence at each other.

"Well, don't act drunk," Omertà said. "Benni is going to kill us."

“Okay, okay,” I said.

“And don’t do that thing,” she said. “Don’t ask her out.”

“Nah, nah, I know you’re trying to spare my feelings in case she says no but I’m going to do it, even if she says no. I’ll be okay and we’ll still be friends.” I attempted a big drunken thumbs-up but ended up waving my hand hello instead.

“No, I’m telling you not tonight.”

“What? No, it’s my birthday. I planned this. I’m a man and sticking up for myself and yeah, y’know.” I said. 

Out of our minds and under the influence we stared at each other smiling. Something fierce rested beneath her smile.

“It’s my birthday,” I said and my voice cracked. “I’m a man,” I thought to myself and didn’t say. What a man, huh?

“Not tonight,” she said with a finality of tone I could only dream of.

Mentally, I crept back inside the lockers I had been shoved into as a kid. Omertà fought my battles and always had my best interest so I guessed I’d shut up and listen this time. Kids, don’t be like me. Stand up for yourself.

I let the ambrosia take my sadness away, I still had the drink with Little John anyway.

"Happy birthday, Jay-Jay," said a voice so cheery it could only be Benni.

Benni ran over to us in her best dress. I walked over to her; we were in a will-they-won't-they phase in our sort of friendship, sort of romance. Oh, wow, since she's gone now, I guess we never will. It's crazy because right now it's obvious I loved her.

Hugging her felt like hope in the flesh, and at that moment I would have bet my soul we'd work out. It was just a matter of time. Maybe it would have been.

As the sun must fall and the seas must rise to consume the Earth, all good things must come to an end, as did my embrace with Benni in a euphoric blur, I'm unsure who let go first, but we both chuckled after. She walked away to greet Omertà next.

"Omertà!" Benni greeted her.

"Benni," Omertà said, and well, the mermaid wobbled, cross-eyed, and missed Benni completely, falling flat on her face and laughing the whole time.

"Omertà!" Benni scolded. I giggled in such a way I guess it made it obvious I wasn't sober. "Jay-Jay!" Benni groaned.

"Little John," Little John said, announcing his presence.

"Little John!" we all joined in.

"They're drunk." Benni pointed at us, and her voice had a certain thirst to it that screamed she wanted to lecture somebody. Little John's eyes whispered longing, hunger to cut loose and enjoy the moment with his friends.

"Oh, um, did you try the ambrosia?" Little John asked me. “Happy Birthday by the way.”

"Yeah, bro, it gets you like..." I meant to make the okay sign with my hands but instead made a five. My motor functions were failing me. So, instead, I just said, "It's really good."

Little John—who like every Little John ironically fit his namesake—shrugged and slumped those big shoulders of his.

"Oh, I’m a little loopy so I left it,” I said feeling my empty pockets. “I'm sure Omertà can make another portal," I said.

Omertà wobbled a finger in front of her. "No, a little difficult right now. We have to stay for a bit."

Too drunk to acknowledge how odd it was that Omertà couldn’t make a portal now I let it slide. Omertà could make a portal out of almost any body of water.

“Yeah, besides,” Little John said. “I don't like drinking a lot in public. Have to keep appearances, you know?"

"Yeah, sure," I said.

"But I'll be over this weekend. Save me some."

"Hmm," Benni managed between frowning and judging.

We walked through the Green Back Alleys of Earth, in a city called the Serpent's Eden which is pretty much Vegas for the strange and supernatural. Bright lights, dark rooms for dark creatures, shenanigans, super-structured Elvish restaurants, pristine insides, vomit and drunks on the outside. 

The peaceful smell and sound of saltwater streams in the street filled our nostrils and trickled into our ears —both Atlanteans and merpeople can't be outside of water for long. A special full moon hung in the sky and kept the night a jacketless warm, like a gentler sun so werewolves could wander around. Little John nearly drooled awing at the beauty of sirens and other Inhumans. My eyes rested on Benni.

Unfortunately, after ten minutes or so I couldn’t walk anymore and I wanted to go home. In a battle for control of my body, the ambrosia was winning. Gracious in defeat I giggled and enjoyed the ambrosias effects but each step I took made the world wobble. Benni, Little John, and Omertà took turns keeping me from falling.  I decided tonight maybe should be a movie night rather than an exploratory night.

“Guys, I need to go home or just sit on a bench or something for a bit.”

“Oh, okay,” Benni said. “Let’s find a - -”

“No!” Omertà said.

Stunned, I raised my hands in surrender. Benni took a step back, nerves getting the best of her. Little John opened his mouth to speak and then shut it.

“He doesn’t look well,” Benni said.

Despite her drunkenness, Omertà grew grim.

“We stay,” she said with a deep frown, revealing wrinkles in her skin that were hundreds of years old. “We stay tonight.”

“Why?” Benni asked.

“It’s important,” she said her frown only deepening, revealing more and more age. How did I think I understood this woman…this thing? This thing existed before my country was founded. When humans were still deciding right and wrong, the nature of evil, Omertà existed, probably swimming by.

“Yeah, yeah, it’s co- co --cool, Omertà. I’ll stay.” Stuttering again, I felt like that little kid getting pressured into something he didn’t want to do again, except this time Omertà couldn’t save me. Omertà was the cause. Maybe, some things can’t change.

Benni helped me the rest of the way as we walked. I prayed she and Little John didn’t leave my side that night, something wasn’t right with Omertà. Of course, the two would leave me.

By Omertà’s scheming, the gang and I, didn't go to our regular spot that night; instead, we went to the Sacrificial Lamb for poker, stumbling through other degenerate gamblers to find the table we wanted.

Omertà and I wobbled into vacated seats. A guy and his genie friend named Jen left because she wasn't having a good time—poor girl, she looked like she wanted to off herself.

Benni and Little John didn’t play. They hung out behind us and watched.  In general, Benni railed against degeneracy of all kinds, she wouldn’t even make a bet on the sound rising the next day. Little John wanted the appearance of being perfect so he only gambled when just the four of us hung out in private

Omertà would use their wants to draw them away from me.

Anyway, we got to playing poker. Of course, as drunk idiots, we were the first ones out. But of course, as drunk idiots, we bought back in.

Giggling and gathering my chips I froze when I realized Benni was gone.

“Hey, Omertà. Where’s Benni?”

“Oh, I told her I had a friend who wanted to hear her thoughts on supernatural adoption so she went off to talk to him.”

I swallowed hard and pretended that didn’t bother me. That was normal for us-ish It would be normal if it wasn’t for this night. To understand us, you'd have to understand what all of us wanted.

Benni preached the gospel of adoption to every supernatural creature we encountered. She believed in a Fairly Odd Parents situation where magical creatures would adopt and help the loneliest and most harmed humans. This could create a sort of supernatural harmony, potentially. 

Yes, so it was normal-ish for Benni to go off like that.

So, I got on and played the next game of poker. The table of supernatural miscreants happily obliged us. Omertà and I were giggling idiots who had the whole table laughing and were pretty much giving away all our money. So, of course, we prepared to buy in a second time.

“Thanks, Om,” Little John said. “I’ll see you later.” Little John walked away taking any feeling of safety I had with him.

“Hey, John,” I whispered to him, hoping to stop him without causing a scene. 

“Hey, John,” I said louder.

“John!” I yelled and fear leaped from my gut and traveled through my voice trying to reach him but the room’s celebrations covered my pleas.

“Relax, Jay-Jay, you’re so scared tonight,” Omertà said. “I just gave him a lead on who to talk to. Y’know, he’s always looking to schmooze.”

Again, normal-ish.

Little John wanted a revolution of genuine justice, change, and an intersection of the supernatural world and the regular, all led by him, of course. He had big "I'll be President one day" vibes. So, appearances were everything to him. He evangelized to no one; they would one day be under him anyway. However, his one saving grace was he lived by the motto "If I want to save the world, I must first save myself."

So, yeah normalish but by this point I was full-on panicking.

If you’re wondering, I had no grand theory on how to save the world, personally.

Omertà had her own plans for a better world that were already so far in motion we just didn't know them yet.

I played a panicky game of poker and we lost our money again and bought in a third time, Omertà fronting me the super-natural coin.

This time a Satyr, our game master, put his hand on my shoulders. Hid odd goatish eyes seemed pitiful.

“That’s a bad idea,” he said.

“Don’t you mean baaaad,” Omertà said, imitating a goat’s cry, she got a bit racist against the other species when she drank.

The Satyr’s unwavering eye contact didn’t allow me to chuckle.

“It’s three buy-ins max and then you must finish the game,” the Satyr said.

“Yeah, that’s how poker works,” Omertà said.

I rose to leave. Omertà's powerful hands pushed me down and turned me to the face the game.

“We’re fine, ignore him,” she said.

In a champagne glass reflection, I saw the Satyr shake his head.

Alcohol lessening its effects allowed us to thrive. We did win the game. We cleared out the whole table; the only one left was a merman and his quiet companion, a freckled-faced high school human, standing behind him in silence.

“Hey, Jay-Jay,” Omertà said.

“You know why I wanted you here and just you?”

“No…” I said tapping my foot under the table like a scared rabbit ready to run.

“For that briefcase in the middle, we just won. Inside of it is a silver trident, the only thing that could kill a mermaid. I want you to have it.”

Shocked but not yet relieved I waited for the catch. “What?” I asked. “Why me?”

“Well, I wouldn’t want it at my place that’s too obvious if someone broke in they could kill me. If it has to exist, which it does unfortunately, I want you to have it.”

“Not Benni? You’ve known her longer.”

“Nah.”

“Why not?”

“You’re soft,” she said and shrugged.

“Oh,” I said.

“I know you’d never hurt me.”

“You know calling a guy soft isn’t a good thing.”

“Awww, Jay-Jay,” she said and squeezed me for a hug “It is for me,” she said and the anxiety of the night left me in a cool breath. Hugging her back, I let the tension of the night slip away. Omertà really was my best friend. 

That ebony briefcase was the least important of my winnings. It would also include some more magical items and favors from creatures of the mythological variety. What a good night. I was so relaxed I didn’t even mind the scowl the merman across from the table gave me.

"Good game, man," I said. "Omertà and I will split our winnings, so that's it for us."

"Oh?" the merman said. The gills on his neck ruffled as he spoke. "But I'm still in, so the game isn't over."

"Um... yes, it is. No buying after 2 AM—those are the rules," Omertà said. She could always be tougher with the supernatural than me.

"Oh? But everything fun happens after 2 AM. Besides, I'm not buying in. I've always had this extra collateral."

Omertà and I exchanged glances. The merman spun his finger in the air three times, revealing his arm was covered in chains, and following that chain was a clamp around his companion's neck.

"Why do you look so surprised?” he asked. “You're at the Sacrificial Lamb. That's the whole gimmick. One of you owns the other so you can sacrifice them anytime."

I looked at Omertà, she looked at me. We looked at a human on a horse marching a leprechaun through the building, an orc with chains on a goblin, and a gray-skinned girl riding a minotaur.

"Do you own me, Omertà?" I asked.

"No, what? No way!" her face pleaded innocence this time, not a wrinkle showed on her perfect face.

“Have you been lying to me? Have I been your slave or something this whole time?”

“No,” she said. “Jay-Jay listen I have never lied to you. We’re friends.”

I eyed her and did not believe her. The ambrosia spoke to me, it made me mad. Anger bubbled in my guts and I had to let it out. 

“Liar!” I yelled to her. I never spoke to anyone that way.  Before I met Omertà, I’ve had people steal from my wallet and put their money in my pocket and I still didn’t dare to call them out. That night I finally had enough.

My heart raced; my hands shook; my mind bounced between guilt over letting myself be used again, pity for my own foolishness, and confusion because what if she wasn't lying. I stood up from my chair and backed away from her.

The satyr stomped his hooves before commanding me.

“Sit and finish the game,” he said.

“I don’t want to play anymore.”

“Then you forfeit yourself.”

“What?” Omertà said. “No, I don’t own him.” 

The satyr ignored her.

“Sit or else,” he said.

“Do not threaten him!” Omertà commanded, her wrath gnarled her face again and it made me feel good. A friend sticking up for a friend, right?

Fear bullied me though. I feared that this whole business I was engaged in for years was a trick, that Omertà was pretending to be my friend. *And why wouldn't that be the case? It happened in middle school and elementary. Perhaps that was all I was meant for. I wasn't meant to have friends.*

I smacked the poker chips across the table.

The satyr yanked me by my collar and pulled me to him. 

“Do not move the chips!” he bellowed.

Omertà rose. 

“Do not touch him!” she said and emphasizing her words she punched the Satyr in the jaw sending him to the floor.

I still don’t know if that was friendship at the time or an act.

I rushed inside the restroom, desperate for alone time. 

The walking merman rampaged through the door and crushed my time of contemplation. The now slaveless creature charged me.

"Hey, wait—" I got out before he grabbed me by my collar and pushed me across the room until my back collided with a mirror on the wall. I gasped for breath. Stray glass tore my flesh. More pieces rained down and clattered on the floor.

His tattoed stony arms—as tough and rough as stones built to make ancient cities underwater—pulled me closer to his face. 

"We have a game to finish," he said, his spit tasting of salt water.

The ocean's stench blasted from his mouth: rotten eggs, sulfur, and all the dead and decaying bodies tossed into the sea. Flecks of ocean muck landed on my face. Sand bristled from his face onto mine as his expression contorted into uncontrollable rage

“I don’t want to play anymore!” I begged.

“Because you cheated? You and Omertà? That scene about you fighting was just an act. Clever Boy.”

"N-n-no, I swear."

"You lie," he said and pushed me again against the wall. Shards of broken glass went into my skin like spikes. "Shall I send you to the farm?"

"I don't know a farm. What farm?"

"Now, I know you think I'm a fool! You travel with Omertà—you know the farm."

"I've never been to a farm. I live in the suburbs."

"Funny, human. Then perhaps you should visit," he said with a smile, and flakes of sand fell from him. With the speed of a fairy and the gentleness of a rabies-infected demon, he opened his mouth and with one deep breath literally stole all the oxygen from my lungs. I passed out.

Tossed in darkness, I felt my body swell like a massive bruise. I stayed that way for a long time until I managed to peel my eyes open. My body felt swollen. I awoke at a farm, in a barn to be specific. My senses overrode into action. Cramping with hunger my stomach growled. My dry lips burned to the point of pain, and my throat thirsted, begging for anything to drink—the hay even seemed appetizing. I shook my head at that. No, I couldn't be that desperate, not yet. Light streamed out from the windows in the barn; it was morning.

I sat up and collapsed back down like a dumb baby getting used to my body. A smell, a liquid stench, prompted me to go forward. I crawled toward the smell of a bucket in the corner of the barn. Throat begging, stomach roaring, and feet and hands pattering over each other in a primal pilgrimage, the kind that made mankind cross deserts.

I nearly tumbled, knocking the bucket over once I reached it. I steadied myself by burying my hands in the dirt. Only then was I honest with myself, only then did I admit what it was I wanted to lap up in voracious mouthfuls. 

Pee. Urine. Piss.

I mourned that version of me that could drink from it. I was jealous that at least their thirst would be quenched.

My thirst was that great. 

I didn’t drink it but I wanted to. Ashamed of myself, I closed my eyes. Once opened, I stared in the bucket.

I did not see what I expected. The reason my body felt so strange was because I was in a different body.

My eyebrows, eyelashes, and hair were gone. I screamed, my face stretching into a fatty mess. All color from my skin vanished, not turning me white as in Caucasian but white like paper. No teeth remained in my mouth of black gums. I stood up and saw my body: I was massive and naked, a giant baby of muscle.

Running out of the barn, I reached a cornfield. I stopped to gape at the people in the cornfields who hung like scarecrows, people identical to me. In this upside-down world, actual scarecrows prodded them with pitchforks.

On a road behind me, an elf steered a black carriage full of not horses, but men who looked just like me in my current form. I ran further. On the side of the barn ran a trough where more men like me ate on their hands and knees like pigs from the perhaps 100-foot-long trough. They were like pigs but wrestled like men, jostling for position to debase themselves in the filth they were served.

Further still was a family of fae gathered below a makeshift wooden stage and watched, clapped, chatted, and sang as those who looked just like me were whipped, cut, and beaten in a bloody and bone-revealing mess.

"Ah, Tolkien without a pen. I messed up," a voice from behind me said. It was a scarecrow with a massive pumpkin head too big for his body; it made him take a couple of steps to his left and to his right like he was trying to balance the weight.

"You weren't supposed to be out of the barn yet," his voice was like an adolescent boy's. Mind you, I was scared, but the way he wobbled with his big gourd was comical. I opened my mouth to speak but noticed I was missing a tongue.

"Hi, I'm Little Crane. I'm your new master. Sorry, I was just filling up a bucket to give you a drink," he adjusted the legs of his overalls. I smelled what was in the bucket.

Reader, I am more ashamed than you will know, but it is more important to be honest. Reader, I wanted to drink what was in the bucket and stepped toward him.

"Yeah, good boy, good boy, no need to be ashamed. Your body's changed now—you're designed to want this. It's how we keep you around." I took another step toward him.

"Who sent you here? Merfolk probably—they're one of the few who can do that. The merfolk are the biggest donors to the farm. Was it Omertà?"

I stood right above him. He raised the bucket up to me.

"Welcome to the farm," he said, and I buried my face in the warm bucket. "That's right. The longer you stay, the thirstier you get. It's only been a few minutes and look at you. Look at how you changed."

One week. It took one week for Omertà to figure out how to bring me home. In that week I did things I will not describe to you, but I promise I will never judge another man again in my life.

It was another week before I could talk again.

It was another week after that before I could ask Omertà about what still haunted me. *What was that place and how many people did you bring there?*

Like I said before Reader, all this hate was once love. But was the hate always [there?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Finchink/comments/1hbv7wv/prologue_below/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
