I thought this was going to be another easy yet tedious job. I thought all I had to do was to look after Ben and the house, and everything would go alright. If only I knew how wrong I was.   
 

 For some background, I was born and raised in South Jersey, and my childhood was relatively simple. I was 13 when I began babysitting for relatives such as my uncles and aunts, and once I turned 15, I started babysitting for other people for some quick cash. Fast forward to two days ago, when I got a call to babysit for a friendly couple. The job was simple: Be at their house today at 5 P.M and babysit their child, Ben, until they came back from their date at about 11 or 11.30 P.M. They paid me $15 an hour, and the next day school was canceled due to heavy snow covering a lot of the streets outside. Plus, I really needed that money to buy a new game that I wanted to play with my friends.

This brings us to today, where nothing out of the ordinary was happening for a little while, it was a dark windy night, and it had been snowing severely all week. It had now been a boring twenty minutes since Ben was tucked into bed. I had been slowly browsing through social media on my phone when I first heard it. It was a low rattle from upstairs, ‘nothing too concerning’ I tought to myself while continuing to browse social media on my phone for another two or three minutes before my ears were blasted with a high-pitched scream. It was Ben. I gripped my phone hard and instantly jumped up from the couch, and I rapidly ran upstairs. I booked it into his room the moment I made it to the second floor, and what I saw will haunt me for the rest of my short life.

 Ben was not alone, his bedroom window was wide open, and right on top of his bed was something, I don’t know what to call it, it had all the characteristics that resemble a human, but it was too large to be a human, it was very furry with grey fur covering all of its muscular body, it had eyes that emitted a light-red color and its hands were like that of a chimpanzee, but with only four fingers that could probably easily cruch a melon. It was feasting on Bens body, blood and human parts were splattered all over the room. I was frozen in fear. I tried to slowly back out of the room, but the thing had noticed me already, it looked straight at me and all I could do was run, which is what I did. I ran into the second-floor bathroom and locked myself in there. I could hear the loud footsteps of that thing getting closer and closer to the bathroom door, and suddenly everything went silent. I peeked under the door and saw that it was just standing there, menacingly, and then I heard my mothers voice through the door: "Art, open the door, everything is going to be alright." it said in a calm tone. I froze in terror, and I could feel that my heartbeat became increasingly rapid. What was that thing, and how did it imitate my mothers' voice so well? It also took me a few seconds to realize that it called me by my nickname, Art. My full name is Arthur, and I like to draw a lot, so my parents found it fitting to call me Art.

  Everything was silent for a few more seconds before that thing started slamming on the door. I could hear it speaking, talking to me in many voices at once. It kept screaming for me to open the door and that everything was going to be alright. I called 911, but because of the heavy snow, they said it would take some time to send a patrol unit here, I pleaded with them to be quick and hung up. Since my phone was about to die, the last thing I decided to do was document what happened today and pray that my death would be a quick and painless one.
