I don’t even know if anyone’s ever going to read this.

I’m just dumping it into Notes because it’s the only app that still opens right now, and the battery icon’s been stuck at 18% for… I don’t know, a while. Long enough that I’m starting to hate that number. The time in the corner says 2:17 a.m. and hasn’t moved.

If this ever pops up on somebody’s screen and it just reads like some guy falling apart, that’s… yeah, that’s probably accurate. I’m not going to pretend I’ve got this under control. But if you’re the kind of person who wanders into stairwells with no signage “just to see where they go,” I need you to read this all the way through.

And then I need you not to be that person.

I work nights in building maintenance at St. Alban’s Medical Center in Phoenix. Technically, my badge says “Building Systems Technician II,” which sounds like I should have a lab coat, but in reality I still plunge toilets and un-jam automatic doors.

St. Alban’s is one of those hospitals you drive past on 7th Street near the 202 and don’t really notice. Beige concrete, mirrored windows, sad little shrubs that die every summer and get replaced every winter.

I’m thirty–four—wait, no, I had a birthday in June. Thirty–five.
My brain keeps defaulting to thirty–four like it’s trying to save me one year on the wear-and-tear.

Night shift is usually quiet. A couple nurses, one ER doc, a sleepy security guard. The building settles into this constant background noise: HVAC, ice machines, telemetry alarms, wheels on linoleum. It all turns into one low hum. You don’t notice it until it stops.

The night this started, I was covering for Kyle, who called out “sick” but I’d bet a week’s pay it was because the Coyotes had a late game. Midnight to eight. I grabbed a cup of cafeteria coffe before they shut down at eleven. It already tasted like the pot was on its second day.

Around one, my radio crackled.

“Facilities, this is admitting,” Rojas said. “We’ve got a flickering light in the old admin corridor. It’s giving Mrs. Harvey a migraine.”

“Copy,” I said. “I’ll head up.”

The “old admin corridor” is the forgotten wing on three that used to have HR and billing before they moved everything downstairs and half-online. Now it’s dusty records, empty offices, and people who don’t want to be found.

I grabbed a ladder, a spare 2x4 LED troffer, my tool bag, logged it, and took the service elevator up.

The doors opened onto a dim hallway. Motion-sensor lights clicked up as I walked: hoodie, scuffed boots, badge with a curling “HAPPY 35” post-it.

The bad light was easy to spot—one panel twitching bright/dim/off like it couldn’t pick a setting. I set the ladder up, climbed, and popped the diffuser.

The plenum above should’ve been a throatful of sound: air handlers, duct noise. It was still. Cooler, too, just enough to raise the hair on my arm.

The LED panel looked fine. Wiring solid, no heat marks. The sticker on the back, though:

LITHONIA LIGHTING 2G7 2X4 TROFFER 4000K.

We use 2GT8s. I’ve written that model number so many times my hand could do it alone.

“Sure,” I muttered. “Typos all the way up the chain.”

I gave a tired little laugh.

Then everything turned off.

Not just the light. The building.

HVAC roar, ICU beeps, distant traffic—gone. My ears rang in the vacuum.

The panel flared once and died.

The corridor dropped into solid black so fast my stomach lurched. I grabbed the ladder.

My flashlight was on my belt. I fumbled it out and clicked it on.

The old admin corridor was still there.

Sort of.

Same beige walls, same brown handrail, same desert print with “COMMUNITY” under it. But the hallway was longer, stretched. More doors than there should’ve been, like someone copy-pasted a few extra. The far end sat too far away.

“What the hell,” I said. Hearing my voice helped.

I climbed down. My boots hit the carpet with no sound.

That, more than anything, made my skin crawl.

I turned to where the elevator lobby should’ve been.

Gone.

Fifteen feet away: a beige wall with a red EXIT door and glowing green sign.

I turned the other way.

Same thing. Red EXIT door. No elevators. No stairwell. Just two outs that hadn’t existed a minute before.

I walked to the nearest door. Through the wired glass, I saw another hallway: same carpet, same doors, fluorescents buzzing.

“Breaker tripped,” I told myself. “Weird re-route. Old prints. Whatever.”

I hit the bar.

The door swung open. When it shut behind me, it sounded thin, like a fridge door.

I turned immediately to wedge it open.

Drywall.

No door. No EXIT sign. Just a blank wall and an empty extinguisher cabinet.

“Nope,” I said. “Nope nope nope.”

The hallway could’ve been any back-of-house corridor. Low-pile carpet, handrails, metal doors: 317, 319, 321. The number plates leaned a little, like whoever stuck them on did it fast.

I tried a handle. Locked. Another. Locked.

The wall clocks were the same cheap black-rimmed model we use, but all of them showed 2:22. Second hands frozen.

My phone still said 2:17.

I hit a T-junction with an overhead sign:

← 300–312
→ 300–312

I picked left.

The smell shifted to faint chlorine, like a drained indoor pool. My footsteps made zero sound. I stomped once; the silence stayed.

“Hello?” I called.

My voice echoed back a half-second late, slightly off-pitch. Like somebody was playing me back on bad speakers.

I kept moving.

The vending machine nook looked almost normal: machine, round table, three stackable chairs, bulletin board with a flyer—SAFETY MEETING WEDNESDAY 2PM – MANDATORY—no date filled in.

Behind the glass: chips, candy, soda. At first glance.

Then the differences: DORITOS → DORIOTS. SNICKERS → SNICKER. Diet Coke → COLA LIGHT. The Lay’s logo with LAYS’S under it.

The keypad was a single row of 0–9 instead of a grid. The bill slot was just featureless black.

The lower panel hung open. Inside, the metal spirals were braided through each other in impossible loops.

On the floor, six candy bars in a perfect circle, wrappers peeled back. The chocolate was scored with straight intersecting lines like a simple wiring diagram.

I stepped back without realizing it until the table bumped my legs.

My phone buzzed.

I jumped hard enough to drop the flashlight. It hit the floor silently.

Banner: LOW BATTERY — 20%. It had been at 60% when I left the shop. I know it had.

Time: 2:17 a.m.

“Okay,” I said. “No. You’re wrong.”

The machine’s hum cut out. The lights above dimmed a notch.

From farther down the hall, I heard a slow drag. Thick fabric on tile. Something heavy pulling itself.

My mouth went desert-dry.

I snatched up the flashlight, flicked it off, then on again by reflex. The beam swung down the corridor.

At the edge of the light, something passed across the hall.

Not a body. An absence. Light darkened where it moved, dimming the fluorescents beyond it. It slid sideways smoothly, then vanished around a corner.

Like a shadow jumping with no person to cast it.

I turned the flashlight off without thinking. Some old lizard bit of my brain shrieked that light made me too visible.

The hum crept back.

I didn’t go see what it was.

I walked the other way.

The corridors kept changing.

I passed through an unmarked doorway and carpet became mottled linoleum; walls turned glossy white; older square fixtures buzzed overhead. Safety posters popped up: WORK SMART, WASH YOUR HANDS, OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR FAMILY, with faces that blurred if I looked too long.

A stretch where every door was CLOSET 1, CLOSET 3, CLOSET 5. All locked.

Around the fifteenth corner I tried marking my path. I slid a torn piece of paper under a door, tied a strip of my blue lanyard around another handle.

Three lefts and a right later, I came to a door with the same lanyard tied on. Same knot. Same frayed ends. Four faint streaks dragged in the paint beside it, ending in neat half-moon erasures.

I left the lanyard. Moving it felt like messing with someone else’s job.

Eventually the hallway blew open into that fake airport.

Ceiling lost in shadow. Big square tiles under me in a pattern that almost looked like a city map. Endless rows of four-seat clusters, vinyl too clean, bolted to the floor.

Gate signs: A1, A3, A5, then B, then AA, AB, AC. Farther letters smeared. Big gray screens overhead glowed blank.

Way across: a wall of glass.

“Outside,” I said. “Has to be.”

I walked toward it.

It never got closer.

No matter how many steps I took, the glass stayed the same distance away. Gate C7 and C8 passed me for the second, third time.

My legs shook. I dropped into a chair. The vinyl didn’t squeak.

Beyond the glass, the world was more of the same—gates, chairs, another glass wall. Like mirrors misaligned.

Then something huge moved across that repetition.

Not a plane. A bulk, a negative space sliding along the concourse beyond. Wherever it went, the gray outside darkened, washed out, then darkened again. The glass vibrated in my spine.

The blank screens glitched. For a second, a line of green pixels tried to spell something—GAT, maybe—but scrambled.

I had to remind myself to breathe.

The thing kept going. No edges, no limbs. Then gone.

I stood up and walked away from the glass.

The restroom was a trap, but not the way you think.

RESTROOMS sign with arrows both ways. I picked one. Beige corridor, heavy door, stick figure with arms bent too high.

Inside, tile, stalls, sinks, mirror. Perfectly clean. No trash, no graffiti.

Seeing myself in the mirror almost felt like waking up. Same tired eyes, same hoodie, same crooked badge.

Then I saw the silhouettes behind me.

Three tall, thin shapes at the far end of the room, in the reflection only. Darker than the rest. No faces. Arms hanging too low.

I didn’t turn around. I just didn’t. Some part of me equated turning with stepping off a roof.

I stared at the mirror and pressed the faucet.

Water arced out. Clear. Real.

In the reflection, it hit the sink and vanished. No splash. No ripple. Just there, then gone.

The silhouettes didn’t move.

I stepped back.

In the mirror, they were closer. One stood right behind my reflection, close enough it could’ve rested its chin on my shoulder if it had a chin.

“Okay,” I whispered.

I stepped forward again. My reflection followed. They stayed.

Up close, the nearest one wasn’t smooth. It was textured, like the side of a building at night. Behind the black, I saw hints of bricks, vents, seams. In its chest, a tiny glowing EXIT sign pulsed backward: TIXE in the glass.

Inside the curve of its shoulder, where bone should’ve been, a miniature hallway ran—carpet, doors, tiny exit signs. Wrong angle to be a reflection of anything behind me.

All the faucets along the sinks were running now. Perfect arcs. No sound.

I turned.

Empty bathroom. Stalls closed. No silhouettes.

The far stall door creaked open. The sound came in torn pieces: squeal, then thump, then hinge noise, all out of order.

That broke me.

I bolted. The door smacked the stopper with a sound my brain refused to process. My shoulder clipped the frame, impact muffled like padding.

Outside, the concourse was gone. Just another low beige hallway.

I didn’t look back.

I found a stairwell next.

Clean green STAIRS sign. Door painted a slightly different beige. It smelled like every hospital stairwell I’ve ever trudged.

Down one flight: landing, big white 3. Down another: 2.

“Good,” I said. “Basement next.”

Down again: 3.

“That’s not funny.”

Back up: 4.

I went up and down, watching the numbers: 3, 2, 3, 4, 2. Different stencil styles, like different people painted them at different times. My heart tried to crawl out of my throat.

I started laughing, high and wrong, the sort of sound you hear yourself make and instantly hate.

“Fine,” I said. “You win.”

I bailed. On the other side of the door, the hall was different. The sign now said STORAGE.

I left stairs alone after that.

Other spaces blurred together: a cafeteria with perfect fake food, fork prongs fused together; a parking level marked P2 where concrete thinned under my foot and the “ceiling” was black glass full of shifting floor plans.

Everywhere I went, I started seeing my own life leaking through. The strip of blue lanyard I’d tied on a door showed up on others. A weird ladder scuff from 3 West reappeared on a wall I’d never seen.

A flyer that used to be blank suddenly had a date written in my handwriting: 10/12.

I don’t remember writing it.

My reflection degraded. Whites of my eyes going gray. Irises losing color. A half-second lag between me and mirror-me. Background sharp, me fuzzy.

My footsteps stayed silent. Clapping sounded like it was happening one floor down.

I don’t think there’s a big moment where something eats you. You just slowly get edited into the background.

The more I saw of the tall things—the Residents—the more they felt like… coworkers.

I watched one “fix” a hallway. Its arm, a cluster of flat pads, pressed to the wall. The surface folded, doors sliding, signs moving, scuffs vanishing. It shifted its hand; the exit sign jumped sides.

It rotated around an axis that shouldn’t exist, and for a second I saw tiny stairwells and waiting rooms inside its chest. Then it was gone, and a red EXIT door glowed where it had been.

It looked exactly like the one outside our mechanical rooms. Same chipped bar, same hinge patina, same scuff in the corner.

Through the glass: St. Alban’s basement. Gray tile, bulletin board with the old Ironman sponsorship flyer Sanchez loves to brag about.

Warm air rolled through the gap.

“If this is real,” I told it, “you’ll have the squeaky tile under the second sprinkler head.”

I hit the bar. The tile on the other side flexed and gave that exact squeaky-wheel feel through my bones.

I laughed, sharp and ugly. “Okay. Maybe…”

I stepped through.

The door shut behind me.

When I spun around, it was just cinderblock and paint. Bulletin board, flyer, blank date. No door. No EXIT.

The boiler roar was gone. The air went flat again.

I slid down the wall and, eventually, pulled my phone.

2:17 a.m. Battery: 18%. Wi-Fi gasping at a bar, then nothing.

I opened Notes.

I’ve walked until my legs ache, sat until my head swims, walked again. Time means nothing. My phone insists it’s still 2:17.

The lobby I’m in now has walls covered in black-and-white photos. Empty streets, overpasses, stairwells, loading docks. No people, no cars. In every photo, somewhere, a door.

I’ve been playing a messed-up Where’s Waldo with them while I type.

One is the old admin corridor. I can see the “COMMUNITY” print and the dent in the baseboard where Kyle dropped a tank and pretended he didn’t. I’m 90% sure it’s the same dent, anyway.

In that picture, the SERVICE door at the end is closed.

There’s a tall, narrow shadow behind the wired glass.

The photo next to it is a stairwell landing with a painted 3. My shadow is there mid-step, blurred, one foot off the ground.

I don’t remember anyone taking it.

My battery icon hasn’t moved. Still 18%. Time still 2:17. The Wi-Fi symbol keeps flashing like it wants to show something, then gives up.

Something’s moving in the corridor outside. That same drag of heavy fabric and deeper groans, like metal under stress. The photos nearest the corner vibrate in their frames.

I don’t think the Residents are hunting me. They’re just… doing whatever their version of a job is. Punching a clock somewhere I can’t see. I’m the glitch.

Feels like everything gets dumped on maintenance eventually, one way or another. Floors, walls, systems… people. We’re the catch-all folder.

If this Note somehow leaks out—if whatever passes for network traffic in here spills into yours—maybe it’ll help someone.

If you work nights, if you’ve ever been last out of a building, if you’ve ever walked down a back hallway and thought it felt a little too long, or the air was too still, listen.

When you see a door you’ve never seen before in a hallway you know by heart, don’t open it “just to see.”

When exit signs point both ways to the same room numbers, turn around. Go toward noise.

If you walk down a corridor and your footsteps don’t make any sound at all, don’t be a hero and take another step “just to see.” Look for your mess: the ladder scuff you made last winter, the coffee stain nobody cleaned, the burned-out bulb you keep meaning to replace. If they’re not there, if everything looks freshly installed and wrong, back up until the world looks worn again.

If you find a vending machine where all the brand names are off by one letter, just keep walking. You don’t need a bag of DORIOTS that badly, I promise.

If you walk into a bathroom and every faucet’s already running and the water doesn’t move when it hits the sink, get out. Don’t check the mirror. Seriously. Just don’t.

And if you ever see a tall, thin shadow at the end of a hallway that your eyes keep sliding off, like a blind spot—

—don’t call out to it for help.

Because it might hear you.

And it might try to help, in the only way it knows how:

by making room.

The air in this lobby is thicker now. The ceiling’s climbed higher; the corners are lost in shadow. Some of the photos have changed—one empty street now has a St. Alban’s sign way in the background.

The hum in the walls is getting deeper. Less HVAC, more construction. Like cranes and concrete shifting somewhere just behind the drywall.

I know a little more now than when I first panicked at that EXIT door. Enough to maybe nudge things for whoever ignores all this and stumbles in anyway. A hallway that doesn’t fold under your feet. An exit sign that actually points somewhere better.

I’ll be the one smoothing walls you never see, pressing too many fingers into the paint and sliding doors a few inches this way or that.

Until then, do me a favor.

Stay in the loud parts of the world. Doors slamming, carts squeaking, somebody complaining the coffee tastes like mud. That’s the good stuff. That means you’re still in the real layers.

And if admitting calls you at 1 a.m. about a flickering light in a wing nobody uses anymore, grab a ladder if you have to.

Just do me one favor and leave the door that says SERVICE alone.
Let the headache light flicker. You can live with that.
