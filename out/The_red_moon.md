The moon has always intrigued me. Every single phase of the moon seems special. My personal favourite is the full moon. It is quite attractive indeed. Especially, if the moon is red. The colour of the moon matters to me. Unlike myths, creatures like us do not turn unless it's a rare red moon. I bet you can see the moon like the size of a tennis ball. It appears quite big to our eyes, at least 5-7 times bigger than normal human vision can perceive. 

During the moonlight night, my bloodlust increases to it's peak. I always find a lazy prey because they are usually easy to chase. Once I find them, I eat their flesh and leave their mutilated bodies in the wood. The people of my town rules these murders as crazy animal attacks. Although some of them know that it's not just an ordinary animal, but something more sinister. 

I always keep my trails hidden and watch out my back. No one is safe in this small town, not even creatures like us. 

The transformation is really painful. All the bones in my body breaks and crunches during the red moon. I cannot help myself but groan in pain when the transformation takes place.  I am not exactly a warewolf....but something between a warewolf and a beast from hell. 

Yesterday was a red full moon and I was ready to hunt. I crept theough the forest floor looking for my next prey. I heard a distant cry of a child. I ran towards the source of the sound. To my surprise, I saw a little girl, about 4 years of age, holding a teddy bear in her hand and crying out for her parents. She had beautiful blonde hair and was wearing a pink frock. As I lept closer to her, she looked at me with awe. She stopped crying and walked towards me. I couldn't help myself but bursh her cheeks. She was tiny compared to me and surprisingly wasn't afraid of my hideous form. 

She held my hand and said "take me to mommy". 

I complied. I held her hand and we walked through the forest. After walking for a while, I saw a small cottage and the girl pointed towards it and said "home". I took her to the backyard and set her free. As she was walking towards her house, a hyena lept from behind and tried to attack her. The parents were already out at this point. The father was holding a rifle. I couldn't control myself and jumped onto the hyena and tore off it's throat. 

As I did so, the father shot me and I started to bleed. Before running off into the forest, I looked at that little girl who was now crying in her mother's arm. The father began to chase me but somehow I managed to outrun him. 

It's been 12 hours since I was shot. I cannot forget that little girl and how that last surviving part of my humanity was brought back by her. I have bled quite a lot and now the bleeding has stopped. I am hiding in my basement, waiting for the hunters to arrive and end my miserable life. But I will have no regrets. Atleast I'll know that I have done one good thing before my demise. And message to that little girl-- if you ever grow up and see my post, remember that I will be there to protect you.
