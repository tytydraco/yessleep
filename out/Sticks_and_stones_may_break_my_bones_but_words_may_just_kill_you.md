I stood outside, watching as others walked through the heavy wooden doors into her funeral.

I couldn’t bring myself to walk through those doors. The guilt was overwhelming. 

I didn’t even like her. Actually, that’s an understatement. I hated her. For years. I despised her. I raged against her, and secretly wished for her life to fall apart. Prayed for it to all the Gods. These feelings only faded somewhat after the first few years. But even when I no longer felt the familiar burning resentment, I could never bring myself to wish her well. I still secretly longed to witness her downfall. 

Now, she was dead. And maybe, just maybe, it was my fault. 

I found out about my…skill…just a month or two ago. I think I developed it only then, maybe. Because I for sure would have noticed if it had been there earlier. 

There was this celebrity. I’m not going to say who they were, I don’t want all their family, friends and fans coming after me, thirsting for my blood. 

I just read a report about some horrible freaking things they had done. Like, seriously horrible. They were being charged, witnesses were coming forward, the evidence seemed solid. But they showed no trace of remorse or guilt, still denying everything fervently. 

“I really wish \_\_\_\_\_(their name) would just fucking \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_(their way of death) and just fucking die already,” I remember saying to my partner. I can’t say what I said exactly, or you guys might be able to figure it out.

And the next day, it was out in the news. They had died. In exactly how I had described it. 

I remember being freaked out, but quickly collecting my senses. I could not possibly be able to magically cause someone’s death, just by some stupid words. It was just a huge coincidence that they had died the way they had, just the way I had said it would happen. My logical side is pretty strong, so I was able to get over the shock and anxiety within a day or two. I mean, magical thinking never helped anyone. 

The next time it happened, I found it much harder to deny it. 

Someone had walked into my path, and I had course-corrected to avoid him. He then swerved and walked straight into my path again. I barely had time to shift before he slammed his shoulder into mine, nearly knocking me off balance. I cursed, and turned to glare at him. He smirked. 

“Oh just fuck off and die, won’t you?” I yelled, then turned away to hurry off in case he tried to start something. 

I had barely gone halfway down the street when I heard gasps of dismay and yells of concern. 

I turned around, to see a small group of people crowding around something on the ground. I walked over, a little anxious, and mostly curious. 

There he was. The shoulder-slammer. On the floor. Foaming at the mouth. He clutched his heart, choking on his own saliva, then someone rolled him on his side. As his body flopped onto the left, I could see the look of shock, fear and panic in his eyes. Then his eyes met mine, and he stopped moving. Someone began to perform CPR on him. I just stared, helpless, trapped in his hollow gaze that was still laced with pain and fear. 

I just stood there, frozen, until the sirens came into hearing. I watched, dumbstruck, as he was carried into the back of the ambulance by the medics, who continued to perform CPR on him. 

“He’s not breathing, I can’t get a heartbeat,” the CPR woman told the medics. 

I watched as the ambulance drove off. 

The whole saga with the celebrity came back to mind. Did I just…kill someone else with my words?

I…there’s just no way. At least, that was what I thought. 

For the next few weeks, I kept trying to convince myself that everything was one major coincidence, that if I went to see a therapist, they would tell me it was just magical thinking, that our thoughts could not possibly influence reality. Or the world would be in chaos by now, and everyone would have won the lottery. I tried really hard, but I couldn’t convince myself. I got really careful about what I said, making sure to never wish death on anyone again. 

I experimented too, with good things, like wishing Socrates back to life, stating that I had won the lottery, shouting out loud that I would become a super smart genius, but none of that happened. It seemed that whatever did come true, it had to be death. 

Last week, I ran into that bitch. I shouldn’t speak ill of the dead, but her death and my overwhelming guilt can still not drown out my hatred. So I guess I should have said that I hate her. Not that I hated her. 

She was really the bane of my existence for a full year or so, and that year and few months were enough to drive me into a deep depression, burn myself out, and contemplate homicide. 

I won’t burden you with the details of that whole ordeal, but suffice it to say, I was properly traumatised. Whenever my mobile phone vibrated, chills would run down my spine and I would find myself hyperventilating, fearing that it was her. Okay I’m going too far down the rabbit hole, I’m going to stop reliving that whole affair. Anyway, good things came from it. I found a few others who had undergone her torture too, and we bonded, formed a support group that we jokingly called “The Survivors”. Maybe that name wasn’t such a joke. We forged really close friendships based on that shared experience of living through and surviving her machinations. 

Anyway, I ran into her at the department store, as I was browsing the barbecue section.

She stared at me as I froze, then smiled a chilling, sickeningly fake sweet smile, and said, “Oh hi. I’ve not heard from you in so long. I really do hope you’re doing well, you know, considering…”

I just gaped at her, words refusing to form with my tensed jaw. She smirked, then walked by me, flicking her hair into my face. The brush of her disgusting strands against my skin made me feel contaminated. Violated. Her presence, her words, her aura, everything felt horrible. I wanted to scratch her whole existence and bad vibes from me, from the space she had just occupied. My gaze focused on the boxes of charcoals and fire starters, and I muttered, under my breath so that she wouldn’t hear, “Kill it. Kill it with fire.”

She was gone that night. Died when her house went up in flames. Thankfully, she was the only one home. 

When I heard the news, a strange mix of emotions settled on my heart. Shock, horror, guilt. I felt tonnes of those. Intense shame and fear of myself too. What kind of a monster was I?

But there was a rush of relief too. And an inkling of glee. Yes, glee. I know, I’m a monster. I basically killed her, and felt joy and relief. 

The little inkling of glee grew, as I slowly moved through the shock, horror and guilt of it all. I’m ashamed to admit it, but that evening, just a day after her death and a mere hour after I had learnt about it, I began to chuckle. Then laugh out loud. Then I burst into gleeful cackling for a good twenty minutes. I just couldn’t stop. All the fear, the anticipation of when her next sabotage would fall, irrational though it might be, all of that left, and in the empty space the fear left behind, relief and unadulterated joy just seeped in, first in a trickle, then a flood. 

When I’d stopped cackling, the guilt resurfaced. The horror did too. Who was I? What was this horrible power that I had? 

“I’m so fucked up. I killed her. I killed her! She’s dead, and it’s my fault. I killed someone. Oh god, I’m so screwed. I’m going to…” I stopped myself mid-sentence. I had almost said, “die”.

That was when the fear hit me in full gale. I couldn’t ever say the word die. I couldn’t get angry and say things I didn’t mean. I couldn’t curse someone in anger, I could make dramatic statements about myself or others. I had to never, ever, say the word, “die”, again. 

Right after not being able to will myself into her funeral, I went for my therapy session. I needed help. And I figured, psychologists had to keep confidentiality, right?

At the clinic, in the safe space of the therapy room, I poured my heart out. The therapist just sat there, quietly, listening and nodding encouragingly. When I was done, at first, she did everything I hoped she would. She validated my feelings, she made me feel heard, understood, seen, and most of all, she didn’t treat me like a monster. She seemed to feel compassion for me. 

Then she began telling me about magical thinking, like I’d never heard of it before. I tried to cut her off, but she persisted. 

“Coincidences happen, that’s how magical thinking is created in the first place. You wore a red shirt and your favourite football team won, and you wore it again and it won again. You create an association with the red shirt and your team winning. It’s how superstition starts, it’s how we develop magical thinking.”

I sighed. 

“I know you don’t want to hear this, but magical thinking is truly something that can cause further issues. Like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Have you heard of that?”

I nodded, feeling defeated. 

“We can manage this in a simple way. We just have to do some…exposure therapy.” I stared at her blankly, her words not really sinking in. 

“You just have to say that someone will die. Keep doing that. Keep saying that. And each time you do it, you are proving to yourself that your thoughts don’t have power. Because they don’t. You can’t will someone or curse someone to death. And your mind has formed that association, and the best thing to break that association is to prove it wrong.”

A long story short, she spent the whole session convincing me that it was all just a series of unfortunate coincidences. She was good. I felt nearly convinced by the time I left. I agreed to come back again the next session, to try out some exposure activities. 

But while my logical self is dying to grasp at her explanation, to believe her, I have a deep-seated gut feeling that she’s incredibly wrong. And that an exposure session would lead to multiple deaths. 

But I want help. I want to prove it to myself that it’s wrong. Or prove it to her that it’s true. I want someone to believe me. I want to not believe it, at the same time. 

The next time I went, she barely went through the usual niceties before saying, calmly and simply, “Say that I will die.”

I gaped at her. “What? Didn’t you hear me last time? You could really die!”

“I know,” she said, smiling reassuringly. “But it’s a coincidence, and I’ll prove it to you, not at anyone else’s expense.”

“I won’t do it.”

“You have to,” she said, her expression turning serious.

“No I don’t,” I said, and stood up to leave.

She marched over to the door and locked it. 

“You’re not leaving until you say it.” She crossed her arms.

“You’re not allowed to do that! Therapists aren’t supposed to…” 

“Watch me,” she said, smirking.

My mouth open and shut haplessly, and I just stood there, trying to make sense of what was going on and what I could do. 

She took a step nearer to me. “Say it.” Her tone sounded almost threatening. 

I shook my head. 

“Say it,” she snarled, taking another step forward. “Say it, you chicken. You loser. Say it, coward.”

My eyes widened as I began to feel the world spin a little. This couldn’t be happening. 

“SAY. IT.” She spat, a few drops of her spittle hitting my face from close range. 

“You’re going to fucking die!” I yelled, squeezing my eyes shut, finally snapping. 

There was a long silence. 

I slowly opened my eyes, to see her smiling at me, almost impishly. 

“You did it. And I’m all fine. See?”

I stared at her, not daring to breathe, waiting for a heart attack or a stroke to hit her. 

She just smiled at me, a touch of arrogance in her expression. She stayed very much alive. 

“How…how is this happening? I swear, it really all did happen. You should be dead!” I stammered.

She looked at me curiously, an odd look in her eyes. It seemed like she was gleeful. 

“Well, it was all a coincidence, like I said. Or maybe,” she said, looking away slyly for a brief moment, “you aren’t the one controlling the deaths.”

“What?” I asked, uncomprehending. 

“What?” She responded, putting on an innocent expression. 

“I’m sorry, I need to get out of here,” I said, and bolted for the door. To my relief, she didn’t stop me from unlocking the door and running out. 

“I’m charging for the full hour!” She shouted after me. 

I don’t know what the hell just happened. Should I experiment more? Do more exposure? See if it was really all just a coincidence? But what if today was a fluke, and future attempts get someone killed? How could I live with a deliberate killing of an innocent soul?

What the hell went on in that clinic? Was she allowed to do that? Don’t psychologists and therapists have like, a code of conduct?

What did she mean that I didn’t control the deaths? And why didn’t it work for her, was it all a coincidence? 

My mind is in shambles. Help me out, please. What should I do? Go ahead with the exposure activities? No? Avoid saying the word death or kill or die ever again and hope I never ever slip up? Go back for therapy? Never go back there again?

Please, just help me out. Any advice is appreciated, please[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkSeas/)
