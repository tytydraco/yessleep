This happened 2 weeks ago . I haven’t really told anyone because I don’t want to sound paranoid, or worse, like I’ve lost it. But I stayed at a Hilton hotel while traveling for something personal, and I swear to you, something was off. Like, deeply, wrong. 

You know that feeling when your brain says “run” and you don’t know why? That’s how I felt the entire time I was there.

It was a nice Hilton with clean lobby, polite staff, big mirrors, that kind of too-perfect lighting that makes everything look sterile. My room was on the 3rd, all the way at the end of the hallway. I remember thinking it was weird how quiet it was. No kids running around, no doors slamming, nothing.

We checked in around 9:00 p.m. and I was hungry so decided to walk down to the vending machines for a drink and snack. After that my brother and I took the elevator back up. We accidentally got off on the wrong floor. That’s when I felt it.

Like someone was behind me.

I turned around.
Nothing.

Not just empty and dead quiet. Too quiet.

We went back in again, I joked to him to easy my anxiety, “don’t you feel like someone is following us?” 

He agreed. 

As I was walking back to my room, I heard a door close softly down the hall. Not a slam. Just a gentle click. When I turned around, all the doors were shut. No footsteps. No voices. But I swear I heard someone’s voice. Not my brothers . Just behind me, like someone was  whispering but loudly enough for us to hear.

I stopped walking.

The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. 

I stood still for a long time, long enough that the sensor lights dimmed slightly, and then I moved again. This time I felt like something was RIGHT behind me. 

That was the first time I really felt scared.

It happened again the second night. Same hallway. Same feeling. This time, I wanted breakfast. My mom and brother left without me so I decided I’d catch up after I got ready. 

As I turned the corner to head to the elevator, I heard it, footsteps behind me. Slower this time. Like they weren’t trying to match me anymore. Like they wanted me to know they were there.

I spun around.

Still, no one… 

That night I woke up at 3:17 a.m. to the sound of something knocking .  I was so confused, But I could hear it, I know I wasn’t half asleep. 

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

Eventually, it stopped.

In the morning, the door was locked , but my backpack I had set down in front of it was tilted slightly to the left. I hadn’t touched it.

I don’t know what followed me in those halls. Maybe it wasn’t a ghost. Maybe it was just a person, or my own fear. But whatever it was, it knew I was there. It stayed just far enough back to never be caught. But I still feel it sometimes, especially in hotel hallways.

To this day, my mom and brother don’t believe me. 

And I don’t stay on the New York Hilton anymore.
