As I sit here to outline this cautionary tale for you, I realize how very young I was when this started — my heart breaks for that broken little boy, but my God, did he complicate things. 


The first part of the story, the part that I need you to learn a lesson from, begins about three weeks before my sixteenth birthday. I won’t sugarcoat it. The truth of our circumstances here really do help to explain our decision making; terrible at best. 


Even as sixteen year old boys. 


We met as kids. We were both in the same emergency care home in Mississippi waiting on foster placements. As eleven year old boys, we already knew adoption wasn’t on the cards for us, we weren’t exactly a hot commodity. 
In a strange way, we felt lucky that we had each other. We didn’t really feel all that lucky about much else, so it was nice when both of us found foster homes in the same school district for a while when we were both 15. Felt like a gift, really.


I’m sure you’ve heard this part before. A couple of vulnerable kids link up and become drug addled statistics by their early teenage years. It was bad.
Bad places, bad people, bad choices. Both of us; Carl and I, got pretty heavily hooked on meth and oxy. 


One night, just before I turned sixteen; the buddy I mentioned, Carl, had walked in on me — a state I’d put myself in *on purpose.*


I’ll spare all of the worst details — thoughts that led me there and what Carl actually walked in on and just say this; Carl saved my life that day. I wouldn’t be alive if it weren’t for Carl and his drive to keep me here. 


Now, we thought it best we didn’t involve any adults or reach out for professional help. We hadn’t found adults to be particularly trustworthy or helpful and we could only see the disasters that often came from involving an adult.


We talked a lot that night, he made me promise that things would get better if I’d stick around. 


I said that I would, but I made him promise that he would kill me if things got much worse. 


I knew that I meant what I was asking of him. I’d already failed once and I wanted to know that if things got worse, he would finish what I couldn’t. 

If things got better, fine, he wins. I’ll stay. 


If things got worse, fine, I win, he’ll see me out. 


*It seemed a fair deal.*


“I’m not just killing you, dude.” said Carl, “I get what you’re asking me, but what if your lust for life comes back just before I send you to the shadow realm?” 


“Carl. I mean it. I’ll show you, get me something to write on.” I replied as I scanned the room with my eyes, “and a pen.” 


I spent the next minute or so whipping up an ‘assisted termination’ document on the back of some overtly crude drawing that began as homework. 


Pen lid in my mouth and a grin from ear to ear, I signed my line with a flourish before placing it on the table and sliding it over to Carl with one hand. 


“Okay, Mr. Sir, this is my proposed agreement. As you can see,” I spiralled my finger around his name to draw his attention, “this is you.” He giggled at me but then furrowed his brow and looked down, I guess he was finding the subject matter a little heavy.


“If things get bad- well, if things get worse and you can see that I’m not okay,” he shook his head and opened his mouth to speak but I continued, “I need you to take me out the game.”


He sighed and encouraged me on with the raise of a brow, “but first you’ve gotta show me a sign, show me that it’s on your mind.” 


He gave me a ‘are you dumb’ with his eyes and then followed with, “you want me to send you a sign that I am thinking about killing you?”


I giggled, “Yes, something that could only have been from you. No phones or emails though, I might miss it.”


He smiled at the idiocy, “that *would* be tragic.” 


“Mr. Sir, please.” I said, mock-serious. “Step two is about trying to make me smile or laugh or something. If I can still smile, I might not be ready. See if you still can, you know?” 


I nodded like a salesman trying to hypnotise a client, but he bought it and nodded with me as if what I was saying made any sense


“Finally, step three.”, using the end of my pen to accentuate my points, “if after steps one and two, I haven’t pulled the plug on this operation, fill this out” now spiralling my finger around the ‘Date of DEATH’ line.


The pushback I’d paused for didn’t come so I continued, “fill the date of death out and return it to me, that way, I can contact you any time up until that date to make it stop.”


I extended my pen to Carl and he looked at me for a moment before he looked down and signed the paper. I was a little shocked, I did think that he might hesitate a little more but he could see how desperate I was.


**‘I, [My Full Name], on the 16th May 2008, request that [Carl’s Full Name] is to have completed his assistance to my termination at his discretion as long as the following three steps have been completed without any pushback from [My Full Name]. 

A sign that it’s coming. Show me that you’re acknowledging that it’s time for you to help me. 
Make me smile, see if you still can. Show me something that I can enjoy. If it makes me smile, I might not be ready.
This contract! Return this contract to me with the ‘Date of DEATH’ completed, that way, I know exactly what to expect. 


Date of DEATH [________] - if all three steps have been fulfilled and [My Full Name] has afforded no resistance. 

Signed - ________  (My Full Name) 
             -________  (Carl’s Full Name)’**


Because we were early-teen drug addicts, we found it both hilarious and completely necessary to sign in blood, too. Of course. So next to each of our names was our respective bloodied thumb print — *edgy.*

I’d love to say that this is the most disturbing and intense deal that I’d ever made.


But it’s not even close.


I’m getting a little ahead there, though.


After we made the deal, we went about life as normal teenage degenerates for about 18 months. This was my personal rock bottom, a lot of shit went down and long story short, it was 120 days in rehab or way longer in prison. 
I took rehab and - I remember this clear as day - on day 44, my girlfriend came to visit me. She was pregnant.  I was *changed.*


I loved Carl and I meant it every single time I’d told him that I would wait for him. My baby girl got me to stay sober, but he didn’t have that. I didn’t judge him and I prayed for him most days but I couldn’t bring him back into my life, it wasn’t safe for the little family I’d built. 


I tried to be kind, I send money any time that I see he’s back in county jail. I send letters when I know where he is living and like I said, the day he comes to me and tells me he’s done with the drugs and he wants to change, I will help him. 

Well, I would have.


The next day that is important was not too long ago, now. It was October last year, 2024. I’d not long since been home from work in the evening when I heard my dog barking. No doorbell or knocking, though so I let it be. A minute or so later, he’d started barking again so I thought I’d just give the porch a once-over. 


As I got to the porch I could see through my front window that something had been left on my doorstep, but whoever had left it had got a head start given that I’d ignored the dog the first time


Upon opening the door, I was hit by a stench that I am all too familiar with as a born and bred Mississippi resident, dead animal. I

I couldn’t source the smell immediately and my attention was pulled to a little metal lunch box on the doorstep, one that a kid would use. Kind of old fashioned. 


I’m not sure how I didn’t connect these dots sooner, but the smell was coming from the lunchbox. A discovery that I made unintentionally as I picked the lunchbox up and the contents spilled onto the floor, a dead crow and a burned up spoon.


My brain was scrambled initially but I felt my body understand what was happening before my brain caught up. 

I knew this lunchbox, it was Carl’s stash box from when we were kids, this spoon I knew pretty intimately, too. 


The bird was a reference to a story from when we were younger. Again, I’ll spare you the gore but essentially there was a guy who I owed a lot of money to and one day, to send a message, he’d left a dead crow on my doorstep too. 


Confusion and disbelief plagued me for a day or two as I tried to contact Carl through various means, all of which proved futile. A very weird practical joke, I thought. I hadn’t even considered the contract. 


Two days after the lunchbox, I’m pretty much calm now and I’m just pulling up at home after a week’s worth of work on a Wednesday and as I step through my door I kick a stack of letters that have been pushed through the postbox.


After taking care of some personal restroom matters, I tracked back through the house and picked up the letters, the very top letter was the problem. Resting atop glossy leaflets and white posted envelopes was a small, square birthday-card type envelope with nothing addressed on it. No words at all, no postmark, no stamp. 


When I picked this envelope up, I could feel from the weight distribution that whatever was in this envelope was smaller than the envelope itself, my curiosity peaked. I was careful when opening it not to damage what was inside, an effort wasted when the shock of what I saw caused me to drop it entirely. 


It was a Polaroid picture of Carl and I, only Carl’s face had been scratched out for the most part and a huge, creepy, smiling mouth had been plastered over mine. Writing these words, I don’t know how this didn’t prompt me to think about the contract, but I didn’t. I thought maybe Carl was in a bad patch, lashing out at someone who escaped the cycle. I didn’t blame him. 


I spent some time that evening reminiscing and thinking about Carl, thinking about the days I spent making bad choices. I thought a lot, but I didn’t think about that deal we’d made. 


That night, my mind wandered back to the Polaroid. I’d scooped it up with whatever else had been posted that day after I’d dropped it in my earlier shock. I couldn’t recall when we’d taken this picture, so I thought I’d go look again. I still couldn’t really tell, but what had my attention in this moment wasn’t the photograph, it was a few mail items back in the pile.


It was a white envelope, A4 sized with the hard back. There was nothing on it though, the envelope was entirely blank. 


Just like the envelope that housed the Polaroid earlier, my stomach churned and my fingers suddenly felt like worms. Something was terribly wrong, my body knew before my brain. 


I’ll have to finish this tomorrow, getting it all out feels good but it’s a lot to get through in one night. *This was just the beginning.*
