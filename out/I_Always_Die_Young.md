I can’t exactly recall the first life I had lived, but it must’ve been around the time of the American Civil War, I think. Don’t quote me on it. I vividly remember my first death, though. You don’t forget the first time your lungs decide they’ve had enough of you. I remember a man in a sweat-stained linen shirt, carrying me on his back toward what looked like a lake. The surface shimmered like oil, catching the sun and throwing it back at us. I think there was a woman behind us, dragging along with a baby in her arms, and two boys running ahead through the grass. She shouted at them — to wait, or not to run, I can’t remember which, but her raised voice made the baby start crying. She sat down by the water, rocking it, humming something low and breathless. The boys stripped off their clothes and dove in. The man set me down and undressed too, then ran after the boys. 

I remember spotting a funny looking tree near the bank. I started climbing it while they swam. The bark was rough and cool. I remember it flexing beneath me. Then the world tilted in slow motion. The sky flipped, the lake rushed up, and for a second, I thought I’d learned to fly. 

The fall tore the breath out of me, and the cold water flooded through my ears, down my throat, and behind my eyes. I have died many times since then, and one thing that sticks out between all of them is how similar drowning and burning feel. The cold bites first, but then everything turns hot, a slow, spreading heat that crawls through you, boiling from the inside.

I remember water pressing me down harder and harder, as if it wanted me quiet. My heart was stuttering, and the sound in my head turned into a roar, then the whole world folded into color. Red, white, black, all turning together until they went still. 

The next thing I remember was crying and screaming inside someone else. Everything still burned, but it was a different kind of fire, it felt wet, and raw. Then someone cut away what felt like part of my body. Voices shouted around me in a language I didn’t understand, and then I was pressed into the arms of a woman. I slowly opened my eyes and saw her face ridden with tears. I believe back then I was Korean, though again don't quote me on that. 

I was trapped in the body of a baby, watching the world unfold again from the beginning, and the older I got, the more the lake felt like a dream or a lie I told myself for no particular reason. That was until I died again. It was sickness that time around. My skin was blooming with red sores that oozed when I touched them. My mother held my hand while I burned alive again. Then, again I saw colours swirling together, folding in on themselves like a kaleidoscope. When I woke up again, I was crying inside another body. 

After that, I died again and again, and I’ve never made it past fourteen. I’ve been a monarch’s son and a thief, a Nazi and a rabbi, a peasant, a girl who sold ribbons by the roadside, a boy who drowned in a quarry before he could spell his own name. You get the idea. After a while all the deaths and births blended into one long flicker of the same life. Once I lasted twelve hours. Another time, eleven years, and through it all I stayed awake inside, watching it happen.

The worst years are always the first ones. Being a baby is hell. Nobody tells you that. You’re a consciousness inside meat that doesn’t fit right yet. Everything itches and swells. Bones stretch too fast, joints ache like they’re full of gravel. You can’t see straight, can’t speak, can’t move how you want. You know what pain is, but not how to describe it. You scream, and they coo and smile, thinking you’re adorable. 

I stopped trying to explain what was happening to me to the families I kept landing in. I’ve watched the world drag itself from gunpowder to nuclear fire. I’ve seen flags change, countries fall, and men repeat the same mistakes in higher definition every time. But one thing never changes: when a small child tells you they’ve lived a couple dozen lives before, the best you can hope for is nervous laughter.

Growing up with a mind that’s centuries old in a body that never makes it to adulthood — it’s like being trapped in permanent adolescence. My thoughts are too big for my brain. Every time I start to understand the world, I’m yanked out of it. Right now, I’m thirteen — approaching my personal record. This time, I’m the son of a police officer and a teacher. We live  in Anchorage. I’ve already made a list of all the possible ways I could die here. Bear attack’s at the top. I’d like to go out in a way I haven’t before. I’ve stopped trying to escape it. Death finds me no matter what. I can only hope that one of those days I will die forever and this whole predicament will be over. But knowing my luck, I’ll open my eyes again, gasping and blind, staring up at another face I don’t recognize, crying for air that doesn’t want me.
