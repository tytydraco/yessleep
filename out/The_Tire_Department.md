I never thought a grocery store would scare me shitless like it did. 

I worked at a local chain of grocery stores in the receiving department, so I drove forklifts during the night and dropped pallets full of merchandise, A pretty boring job if you would have asked anyone else. But not during the night shift. I worked from 9 p.m to 5 a.m. I slept most of the afternoons and that was just my life. My buddies at work were chill, nothing to complain about.

And then, they mysteriously started leaving.

First it was Riley. He was a younger kid, about 18 or 19. He got his forklift certification as soon as he started. He was a quiet kid but joked around with the guys occasionally. 

One day, he ran into the manager's office before we all left at the end of our shift. He was breathing ragged, like he had just seen a ghost. Pale as a fucking piece of paper. "I never want to come back here ever."

And he never did. 

We all chalked it up to him just having a breakdown and being stressed out about the job. No big deal. 

But then Dan, a seasoned professional and probably one of the best guys on the team, stopped showing up to work after a night shift. From what I was told, the night went pretty smooth and Danny didn't have any problems that night until after he went into the tire department.

What he was doing in there, I'm not really sure. Tires got their stuff delivered straight to the garage, so we really never went back there to drop stuff. 

But whatever, he was older so maybe he just was sick of doing the same shit right? 

Wrong. So fucking wrong. I wish it was that simple. 

Curious by the amount of lift drivers that kept leaving, one night after I had dropped all the pallets I needed, and I was sure nobody would notice I was gone, I slowly walked down to the tire department at the front of the store. The curbside department was empty next to it. It was just me there. 

The garage was dark. The long window against the back wall with three chairs against the wall stood still. I almost laughed to myself. Maybe these guys were crazy! I walked up to the glass and peered in.

Air compressors, batteries, all types of equipment lay still in the darkness. Except for this oil slick near the garage doors. It was shimmering bright in the fluorescent light. I leaned closer into the glass, thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me. Then, it oozed. Or morphed is a better word. It started to spread like rain in a water gutter. Sliming over and then beginning to cover some of the spare tires lying around in the corner.

I couldn’t pull myself away from the glass. The thing then started to pick up the tires, becoming an amalgamation of rubber and oil. It grew bigger and bigger, and it instilled so much dread into me , I could’ve cried.

A weird, distorted face appeared on the top of it, melting and growling. It was feral. It was hungry. And with a sickening drip onto the ground, it laughed and started to move towards the door. 

I stumbled backwards. Trying to pick myself up off the ground and then taking off running. Two quiet guys in merchandising gave me wide eyes as I ran past them back to where the forklifts were parked. My body felt cold, chilled to the bone. I was hopeless. I felt like I’d never not think of that fucking creature again. I felt the need to bleed out, to hang, to break every single bone in my body at once and surrender.

I followed suit of my predecessors and I never came back. And if you’re reading this, this is my last recollection of this harrowing experience. It has plagued me for 4 years and I cannot take it anymore. The shotgun is loaded and I’m ready to die.  

“Stay out of the tire department.”
