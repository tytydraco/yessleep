As a wee tot, I didn't have much in the way of technology save for my trusty N64. I'm betraying my age here, I know. So, I spent most of my time playing outside, saving the princess with my trusty stick- I mean, my legendary sword the seals the darkness. Certainly my imaginary world was markedly better than the reality of my home growing up.

Where better to embark on these adventures than during our family reunions in the heart of West Virginia? We all met up ever year at this colonial style house, in the middle of land owned by my mom's side of the family where you're one turn away from Wrong Turn. In retrospect, I'm surprised all of these rich hoity-toity types showed up this deep in the boonies year after year. Well, I digress, back to my play time. 

Blade of Legend in one hand, and a Blue Frost Gatorade in the other, I had set off on my quest. This section of the land had been used for farming and grazing land (I guess?), so the fields and meadows were partitioned by creeks and small tree lines. That was perfect for breaking my game into levels. Being a bit older this year, and markedly more brazen, I pushed farther into the lands of the Ganondorf Dragmire. Yeah, that's his actual last name, look it up. 

Then, I spied it - a dungeon to explore. In reality, it was just this dilapidated old house that looked like it had been on fire once. I could tell it was painted white at some point, by the heavily curled white flakes coming off the wood. I never went inside of it. Actually, I didn't even get that close. I had been studying it for what felt like a few minutes when I heard my mom calling for me. We all know THAT yell, that you can pick up on the wind for miles. She was mad, and rightfully so. The sun was already starting to go down. I hadn't been out there that long... had I? I didn't have time to dwell on it, I could already feel my ass cheeks stinging. 

Mama's got to make a show in front of her traditional, conservative family amirite?

Well, that brings us to today. It's been a few years since I've been able to make it down here for a reunion, but I made it. I knew Grandpa wanted me to come see the progress he's made on the property. I'm actually pretty damn impressed at what he's able to do in his old age and given that he hasn't actually lived here since his childhood. New water well dug, a bridge built over one of the creeks I mentioned earlier, and a whole laundry list of other items. 

This morning, I had kind of overheard my mom talking about a dream she had the night before. I didn't catch most of the details, I was thinking about hiking the hills on the opposite side of the property. Anyway, I did hear her say something about a white house. I had forgotten about it completely and didn't connect the dots until I was a few miles into my hike. I remembered that house from before, but it was on the other side of the property so I figured I'd go check it out again tomorrow. 

I had gotten back from my hike, and spent time being talked at by other family members. At some point, I recalled Grandpa lived here as a kid so I thought about asking him, but he was busy prepping for the bonfire so I resolved to ask him then... I wish I hadn't.

When I asked him, he blew the FUCK up in front of everyone. He categorically denied the house's existence, and told me he'd shoot me if he 'caught me snoopin' again.' He'd never been like this before.. I mean sure, he was stern, but still very kind before. He stopped, realized everyone was staring at him in disbelief and then he stormed off. I wanted to ask my mom what her dream was, but it wasn't the right time. I'll ask her tomorrow.

Well, I'm up in my room as I'm typing this. It's getting late, and I don't hear Grandpa snoring, which means he's awake. His boots aren't by the door. I think he's going to take a walk tonight, and I'm going to follow him.
