I started stealing at a young age, started with small things like money out of my dads wallet; at 15 I broke into my first house and at 20 I broke into a museum, so when my partner in crime Tony asked me if I was down to rob some rich assholes I agreed.

We arrived at the huge 3 story mansion surrounded by at-least 10 acres of beautiful land covered with flowers and yard decorations, I turned to Tony and said
“These rich fucks are asking to be robbed” as we’re hopping the 6 ft gate, Tony just laughed the same twisted laugh as usual.

We made our way up the drive way and around the back to jimmy a window open without being seen, climbing through the window I was left speechless, the house looks way bigger on the inside, after filling sacks with weird decorations and silver cups when Tony yells 
“Hey Robbie check this out!” 
I ran over and to see a basement door protected by a key pad, I said “Shit Tony, this is your specialty” 
But Tony was already on it, once he broke through using something I can understand we went down the dark stairway feeling for a light switch when *click*, “got it” Tony said as the room lit up we saw nothing but a vase on a pillar, when some reddish smoke substance started leaking out almost like dry ice.
“What the fuck” I say looking at Tony who has the same puzzled look;
“I don’t know but it’s probably worth a lot” 
Carefully walking to the vase Tony picks it up and just freezes; “you okay man?” I say

when Tony turns around and I can see the red substance rushing up his nose and turns and laughs that same diabolical laugh, but something’s different, his eyes are just a blood red, and his stance is different like almost a sway but I don’t know just different, I tried to knock the vase out of his hands to stop whatever is happening when he grabbed me by the throat like I weighed no more then a feather and slams me into the floor, I screamed as I felt my back almost shatter and started clawing at his arms and face trying to get him to release his grip when he tosses me into a table.

Struggling to get up I grab a table leg and start swinging at him but it doesn’t seem to do anything but make him laugh as he snatches it from my hand and try’s to slam it across my head I quickly ducked and limped my way to the stairs as fast as humanly possible, Tony just laughing as he follows me, when I see the same red smoke forming around my legs, hurrying I make it to the top and slam the door behind me knowing it wouldn’t be able to stop him, even if he didn’t know how to break through the security, his brute force alone would shatter most doors. 

Making my way to the front door quickly trying to unlock it when more and more smoke fills up the room, barely able to breath at this point I open the door when Tony laughs and said “This was fun” as the smoke grabs me and slings me out onto the yard, thankfully a rose bush caught my fall, trying to stand up now seemed pointless especially with all the new holes in my skin, as my consciousness starts to fade a hear a car slam threw the gate and the scared hung of tires, probably about 10 people hopped out of the dark colored van all holding guns with weird uniforms with an even stranger of logos on each persons arm, as my visions fades darker and darker I smile thinking “at-least the fuckers coming with me”
