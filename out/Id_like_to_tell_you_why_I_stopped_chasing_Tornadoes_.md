I never thought my fascination with storms would lead me to the brink of something so inexplicable, so unfathomable. For years, I was a devoted tornado chaser, chasing the thrill of nature’s raw power across the plains, driven by a desire to understand the mechanics of these tempestuous forces. But everything changed on that one fateful day.

It was a late afternoon in May, the sky a tumultuous canvas of dark gray and green. My team and I had been tracking a particularly violent supercell, one that promised the kind of destruction that seasoned chasers like me lived for. As we set up near a field with a clear view, adrenaline flooded my veins. I felt alive. But what I couldn’t have anticipated was the surreal encounter that awaited us at the heart of that storm.

The tornado formed suddenly, twisting down from the clouds with a deafening roar. My heart raced as I watched the funnel become more defined, its tail stretching down, claiming the earth. It was then that I spotted it shimmering at the center of the spiraling maelstrom. It was unlike anything I had seen; an alien machine, a metallic structure that pulsated with light, churning in sync with the chaos of the tornado. My mind struggled to comprehend what I was witnessing. I grabbed my camera, my hands trembling, capturing every moment of what felt like a fever dream.

In that instant, the storm intensified, and a brilliant flash of blue lightning forked from the sky, illuminating the scene around us in an otherworldly glow. It was as if time stopped, the world around us swallowed by that blinding flash. But when I regained my sight, my heart sank into a pit of dread and the other chasers, my friends, had vanished without a trace. One moment they were screaming in awe, adrenaline coursing through us all, and the next, they were gone, leaving me alone with that horrifying vision.

Panic surged through me, but I was compelled to review the footage immediately upon returning home. I needed to understand what we had seen. Hours melted away as I poured over the recordings, trying to rationalize the impossible. Minutes turned to hours and hours to days. 

That's when I received an unexpected knock at my door. When I opened it, I was met by a trio of stern-looking individuals dressed in dark suits. Their badges read ‘Department of Anomalous Affairs,’ and I felt a chill cut through me. They demanded my footage the proof of what I had captured. I hesitated, instinctively clutching my memory card. But their unwavering gaze and firm tone made it clear that refusing was not an option. They confiscated everything, and as they turned to leave, I caught a glimpse of their expressions cold, calculating, devoid of humanity.

Days passed, and dread settled in like a winter fog. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. It started innocently enough; an unfamiliar black car with tinted windows would appear whenever I left my house. At first, I convinced myself it was paranoia a side effect of the trauma I had just endured. But the more I tried to dismiss it, the more frequently those cars showed up, lurking in the shadows, always a few blocks behind.

I felt trapped, and my very existence snatched into a world of fear and uncertainty. I thought about my chaser friends, about what they must have experienced... are they still alive, if so where they were taken to? I had seen something terrifying, something that broke the boundaries of our understanding, and now I was left with shadows watching me, remnants of a reality I could no longer grasp.

I've since retired, leaving behind the thrill of the chase, for the chase had turned into a nightmare. The thrill of nature’s fury paled in comparison to the dread that now clung to my every step. I left the storms behind, but the storm that began that day still rages on in my mind, a tempest of fear, loss, and the haunting question: What did I witness that day? And will I ever see it again?
