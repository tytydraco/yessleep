It was my first year in college, and my heart raced with excitement when I received my acceptance letter. The first thing I did was search for a place to stay, knowing the commute from home to the university was far too long.

After a few days of searching, I found a student-friendly dorm just a few minutes' walk from campus. It seemed perfect.

On my first day moving into the dorm, I met my roommate, Dave. He was a kind-hearted, tall, and impeccably neat guy who graciously introduced me to the other students in the dorm. We shared a bunk bed—me on the top and him on the bottom. Everything seemed fine and normal, but I couldn't help but notice a peculiar dark spot in his eye.

One day, he caught me staring and explained that he had been born with it. I didn't want to pry further, so I let it go.

Dave was an outgoing type of person; we sometimes walked to campus together. Despite being a first-year student like me, he seemed to know more about the campus than most. Although our personalities were polar opposites—him extroverted and me more introverted—we hit it off well. He was fun to hang out with.

One night, after a particularly exhausting lecture, I returned to the dorm to take a shower and unwind. After cooling off, I went straight to bed. Dave was already there, possibly asleep, but he kept murmuring words too softly for me to understand. I figured he might be from a province and speaking a dialect I didn't know. His eyes were moving beneath his eyelids, and I assumed he was sleep-talking or dreaming, which I thought was a good sign he was having a restful night.

I climbed up to my bunk and tried to shut my exhausted eyes, feeling the heaviness of sleep overtaking me. As I was drifting off, the bunk bed started to move slightly, then shook a bit more. I figured Dave was just shifting below, so I didn’t give it much thought and tried to sleep.

Hours later, I was jolted awake by a sudden, violent shake of the bed. In the dim light, I peered over the edge and saw Dave in the same position he had been in when I first climbed up. This was odd, considering how much he had been moving around lately. Frustrated, I whispered, “Dave, stop moving, I’m trying to sleep.” Exhaustion weighed heavily on me, and all I wanted was to rest.

In the morning, Dave seemed more energetic than usual, and I noticed the dark spot in his eye was gone. Curious, I asked, “Is it me, or is the dark spot gone from your eye, Dave?”

He shrugged and explained that sometimes the dark spot mysteriously vanished. He had consulted doctors and specialists, who dismissed it as a minor mole in the eye. I found his explanation somewhat convincing, though the sudden disappearance of such a prominent feature seemed peculiar. I nodded and continued with my morning routine, pushing the oddity to the back of my mind.

Weeks passed, and the dark spot reappeared, this time in Dave’s other eye. My curiosity gnawed at me, but I kept my questions to myself, not wanting to seem nosy. Yet, the shifting dark spot bothered me like a forgotten song lyric, just out of reach but incessantly nagging.

More days passed, and I pulled myself together, trying to ignore the unsettling eye condition Dave had. We hung out a few times, and he really was just a funny, kind, and hard-working student. Everything seemed to be sailing smoothly in our college life.

Then another night came. After a long exam day, I returned to the dorm exhausted. Dave was already asleep, as usual, his murmurs filling the room again. This time, his words were louder, though still incomprehensible. As I listened, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up; it sounded like he was speaking in a language I had never heard before, in a low growling noise.

I climbed up to my bunk, but sleep eluded me. The bed shook slightly again, just as it had before. My mind was too exhausted from the exam to react, but the uneasy feeling lingered, making it hard to fully relax.

Suddenly, the room grew colder. I pulled my blanket tighter around me, shivering. The temperature drop was sharp and unnatural. I glanced at Dave; he seemed unaffected, still murmuring in his sleep. Restless, I couldn’t shake the conviction that something was wrong with Dave.

Unable to bear the mystery any longer, I decided to stay awake and observe. As Dave slept, his murmuring grew louder and more intense. His words, still foreign, had a sinister undertone. Then his body started to twitch and convulse, the bed shaking violently.

I leaned over the edge of my bunk, heart pounding. Dave's eyes flew open, glowing faintly in the dark. The dark spot in his eye seemed to pulse, as if alive. A chill ran down my spine. I whispered, “Dave?”

He didn’t respond, but the murmuring stopped abruptly. He opened his eyes, and I saw that they were entirely black, the darkness enveloping his entire eyes. Maybe the angle and the shadow of the dark caused it but then he gave me a cold look, then closed them again. The room fell into an eerie silence. I lay back down, trembling, unable to shake the feeling.

The next morning, Dave acted as if nothing had happened, his usual energetic self. But I couldn't ignore what I had seen. It was terrifying. I had never in my life seen a sleep-talker so intense. It felt like Dave was a completely different person that night.

Now, I’m genuinely concerned about Dave. He seems like a good guy, but when he sleeps, he becomes a completely different guy. I confronted him about the strange things he does in his sleep, but he just denied it.

I keep wondering, what's wrong with him? Is he not aware that he growls and speaks in a different language while he sleeps? If I were doing something odd in my sleep, I’d want to know. Maybe it’s just me, but I’m worried about him. Perhaps I was wrong to pry, but I can’t sleep at night because of it. I’m scared of what he does when he sleeps, and I don’t know how to react.

I tried to ignore it, but it kept happening. Dave seems completely unaware. Is it epilepsy? Or maybe somnambulism? I can’t help but wonder. Then that night occurred again. As usual, he was already asleep when I got to the dorm. I showered and tried to sleep. In the middle of the night, the temperature dropped sharply; it felt icy cold. I tried to tuck myself under the blanket, then I saw Dave standing, facing the door. He was completely still. I was freaked out.

I called, “Dave, you okay?” He didn’t respond. I called again, “You okay, buddy?” He turned to look at me, his eyes closed. I was terrified. Dude freaks me out in the middle of the night? I just want to sleep, but Dave’s behavior is unusual. This is scary—too scary. I can’t handle this kind of pressure, so I jumped out of bed, wanting to leave the room. Dave was still standing, blocking the door, staring at me with his eyes closed. I knew he was looking.

I approached him and reached for the doorknob. He then started to talk: “Hello, Keith.” Yes, that’s my name. I was shocked. Is he really asleep or sleepwalking? What is this horror show? Is he messing with me? I twisted the knob and jolted to leave the room, but Dave grabbed my shoulder. He was strong, pinning me to the wall while still holding my shoulder. I SHOUTED. I couldn’t handle the overwhelming fear. I was absolutely terrified.

Dave woke up suddenly, tears streaming down his face. He let go of me and whispered, "He was controlling me!"

"What? Who's controlling you?" I asked, my voice trembling with concern.

"My brother!" he replied in a chilling, sinister voice. Then, he grinned, a smile stretching from ear to ear, his eyes turning completely black like coal and brimstone. I jumped back, my heart pounding in my chest.

I ran, my legs moving faster than they ever had. I bolted down the stairs, waking up other students. They asked what was happening, but I couldn't speak. Fear had taken hold of me, rendering me mute. I was terrified of my roommate.

The next morning, I didn't go to school. I waited for Dave to leave first, then I packed my things and left. That was the last time I saw him. I transferred to a new school and started my studies in Manila instead.
