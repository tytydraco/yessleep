**June 24, 2021**

She continued her grisly transformation, tendrils waving like wicked antennas, the air around us growing colder and more oppressive.

"Becca, it's me, Noah," I pleaded, trying to pierce through her madness. "You have to fight whatever this is. You’re stronger than this!"

She paused for a moment, her severed fingers ceasing their squirming dance in the snow, and I saw a flicker of recognition in the writhing mass of her eyes. But it was short-lived. Without warning, she lunged at me. Her free hand, still clutching the scalpel, slashed at me in a frenzied attack. I stumbled backward, but she was on me in an instant, scratching and biting with a ferocity that was nothing short of animalistic.

Her detached fingers, now unnervingly animated, slithered towards me, twining around my legs, tugging and pulling, forcing me onto the icy snow. I gasped as one looped around my neck, its cold touch stinging like a frigid brand.

She opened her mouth, revealing even more tendrils, each one hissing as they stretched towards me. Suddenly, the sharp pain of her scalpel penetrated my side, the icy cold blade cutting through my flesh.

“Bleed with me…” she whispered sadistically, as she twisted the scalpel, causing excruciating pain to erupt from my wound. I could feel the warmth of my blood staining the ice beneath me.

She leaned in close. Her voice was a chilling whisper that froze my blood. "They're coming, Noah," she said. "Can’t you hear them? They've been calling to me, singing to me. It's a beautiful song... a song of rebirth, of transformation."

Her severed fingers tightened around my throat, cutting off my air supply. My vision blurred and darkened. In sheer desperation, I groped for anything I could use to defend myself. My fingers curled around the cold handle of my ice ax. With a swift, desperate swing, I struck her at the base of her neck.

She gasped, her grip around my neck loosening. I rolled her off me, scrambling to put distance between us. But she quickly recovered, pulling the ax out of her neck with an unholy strength. A dark, pungent liquid oozed from the gaping wound, staining the snow with its sickly hue.

“Becca, please don’t do this,” I pleaded with her.

She brandished the ax, a primal scream erupting from her lips as she charged at me. My hand instinctively went to my side, gripping the handle of Katak's meteorite knife. As she ran towards me, I braced myself, aiming the blade at her. With a terrifying shriek, she impaled herself on the knife, her momentum carrying her forward until she slumped against me.

With an agonized whimper, she staggered backwards, the fierceness in her eyes dimming. Her tentacled fingers stilled, the squirming tendrils retracting into the emptiness of her eye sockets. She looked up at me with a terrifying mixture of fear and confusion.

As Becca fell backward onto the snowy ground, her appearance shifted, morphing into an achingly familiar form. My heart pounded in my chest as I looked down into the face of my grandmother, Anuri. The icy landscape around me faded, replaced by the aged walls of our childhood apartment.

I glanced at my hands, covered in blood, but they weren't mine. They were large, scarred, aged from years of labor—my father's hands. The ceremonial knife in my grip transformed into a crude switchblade, its edge ominously glinting in the dim light, fresh blood dripping from it.

In the corner of the room, a small figure huddled on the windowsill, wide eyes filled with terror. It was me, younger, smaller, bearing witness to a horror no child should see. The night my father, driven by a drunken rage, took the life of the one person who meant everything to me.

"No," I cried, rushing to the figure on the floor. Dropping to my knees, I cradled my grandma in my arms, my tears freezing to my face. She looked just like the night she died.

In an instant, my surroundings shifted. No longer was I in the warmth of my home, but back in the arctic wilderness. It was no longer my grandmother I held in my arms, but Becca. Her skin, once flush with life, was now as pale and cold as the ice that hemmed us in.ds

The once monstrous tendrils retracted from her eye sockets, revealing the blue irises I knew so well. A strangled gasp escaped her lips as the harsh wind whipped around us. I could feel her body shuddering with each ragged breath she took, a frail echo of her former vitality.

My gaze fell on her chest, where a dark stain was slowly spreading. Using Katak’s knife, I ripped off a piece of my jacket and pressed it against the wound, attempting to stem the bleeding, but it felt like trying to dam a river with twigs.

"Noah...?" she croaked, her voice barely audible over the wind.

"Becca," I said, reaching for her hand. It was icy cold. "I'm here."

"Stay with me," I said, cupping her face in my hands.

I could see fear and confusion in her eyes, but also recognition. She reached up, her hand weakly clutching mine. "I'm so cold," she croaked out, a faint hint of her old self returning.

I wrapped my arms around her, pulling her close to me. My heart pounded painfully against my rib cage as I held her against my chest. Her breaths came in short, uneven gasps, each one slower than the last.

"It's going to be okay," I lied, trying to infuse my voice with as much confidence and warmth as I could muster. I knew her condition was dire, the life seeping from her as surely as the blood staining the snow beneath us. But I couldn't let her last moments be filled with fear and despair.

“Noah, I…” she struggled to say.

For a moment, I saw a spark of the old Becca in her eyes, the fierce determination that had always defined her. But then, her eyes rolled back in her head, and her body went limp in my arms.

"Becca," I whispered, "stay with me."

Her only response was a soft, gurgling sound, as if she was trying to speak but couldn't. Her body grew colder, her skin turning a sickly blue.

"No," I muttered, shaking her. "Becca, wake up!"

But it was too late. With a final, shuddering breath, she went still. The hand I was holding fell limply to her side, the icy chill of death already creeping into her skin.

I wasn't sure how long I stayed there, holding Becca's lifeless body, before I finally managed to stand up.

With the last shreds of my strength, I made a decision. Becca deserved a proper farewell, not to be left on this cold, desolate landscape as carrion.

In a daze, I began to gather rocks from the surrounding area, hauling them over to the spot where Becca's body lay.

In the harsh Arctic wilderness, you couldn’t dig a grave in the permafrost. There were no flowers to leave on her grave, no trees to make a coffin, just cold, indifferent stones.

Once I had enough rocks, I set to work constructing an inukshuk, a cairn used by the Inuit as a marker to help the recently deceased to find their way to the afterlife.

Each stone was a silent tribute to the woman who had been my companion, my confidant, my friend. Each stone was carefully selected and placed, forming a silhouette that mirrored the human form. The tallest stone for the body, a pair of stones for the arms, and a smaller stone for the head. The work was hard, and the freezing wind didn't make it any easier, but I forced myself to continue, focusing on the task at hand as a way to escape the grim reality of what had transpired.

Next, I laid Becca's body beneath the inuksuk, folding her arms over her chest. With a heavy heart, I said my final goodbyes, whispering them into the icy wind, praying that they would reach her wherever she was.

“Naglakpik inuup qaumanaq, pulliunarmiun timmuutaq.” “Your spirit lives on in my memories, never forgotten, never incomplete”

Lastly, I placed Katak's otherworldly knife in her hands. I didn’t know why, but I thought she would have more use for it than I would.

With the last of my energy drained, I stepped back to take in the sight. The inuksuk stood tall against the pale sky, its form contrasted against the snow-covered landscape. It was a ghostly figure standing vigil over Becca's final resting place, a silent sentry keeping watch over her as she journeyed to the spirit world.

**June 25, 2021**

I must have wandered for what felt like hours, perhaps even days, with no sense of time or direction. The icy landscape stretched out indefinitely, a vast expanse of desolation as if the entire world had succumbed to the frost. I was numb, both physically from the piercing cold that infiltrated my clothes and skin, and mentally, from the shock of what had occurred.

Every gust of wind, every crunch of snow beneath my feet, seemed to echo Becca's presence. Each shadow cast by the moonlight transformed into demons, coming to claim me. My side throbbed with a persistent pain where Becca had stabbed me, a cruel reminder of the nightmare that had become my reality. The wound was probably infected by now, or maybe I was succumbing to hypothermia. I didn't really care.

Each gasping breath felt like an accomplishment, each blink a momentous effort. My mind, once sharp and alert, now wandered aimlessly in a fugue state.

Suddenly, a shadow flickered across the white canvas of the snow. The shadow caused a shiver of dread to seize my body. I squinted, shielding my eyes against the weak sun, and made out the silhouette of a helicopter. Its rotors were a mere whisper in the icy air, the dull throb of its engines barely audible over the wind's moan.

In my haze of fear and exhaustion, the helicopter was another menacing figure, another Ijiraq sent to torment me. I couldn't risk it. I couldn't bear the thought of falling prey to those shape-shifting demons again. With trembling fingers, I fumbled in my pocket, my numb fingers finding the reassuring grip of the flare gun.

With a shaky hand, I fired the flare. The sudden light, brilliant against the gray sky, arched upwards, a fiery serpent against the dull expanse. The sharp smell of gunpowder filled my nostrils, momentarily overpowering the stench of decay that still clung to my clothes. It was a desperate attempt to ward off my tormentor, a signal flare that carried more of a plea for mercy than a call for help.

The helicopter veered towards the flair, like a moth drawn to a flame.

The last thing I remember was the sudden brightness, an intense spotlight blinding me. A rush of noise, the helicopter descending, shouting voices, the crunch of boots on snow. And Then, with a nauseating lurch, the world turned black.

**August 1, 2021**

When I regained consciousness, the frosty landscape was replaced with white sterile walls and a rhythmic beeping. I was in a hospital, the incessant beeping originating from the machines monitoring my vitals. My frozen clothes were gone, replaced with a thin hospital gown, and the once throbbing wound now bore a clean dressing.

The first few days in the hospital passed in a haze, as I drifted in and out of consciousness. There was always someone there when I woke up – a nurse, a doctor, an official from the Environmental Protection Agency. Their faces drifting in and out of focus as I wrestled with my own tortured thoughts.

As the days passed, my strength began to return. I began to sit up, to speak, to ask questions. With each question, I was met with a flood of information, each revelation more horrifying than the last.

They told me about the drill, about the toxic hydrogen sulfide released into the air. They spoke of a devastating wave of poison that had decimated both the research station and the nearby settlements.

The scientists explained the symptoms, how exposure to hydrogen sulfide could result in severe neurological damage. They talked of disorientation and paranoia, of vivid hallucinations that seemed so real, they had driven some to madness, to violence, even to murder.

They described how the villagers had wandered off into the snowstorm, disoriented and confused, driven by hallucinations to their doom. Only a single newborn infant, miraculously untouched by the poison, had been found alive amidst the ashes of Silap Inua.

The personnel at Outpost Aurora had fared even worse. They'd destroyed their only means of escape, dooming themselves in their madness. Some had succumbed to the toxic gas, while others had fallen victim to their own colleagues, driven by their poisoned minds to horrific acts of violence.

The doctors explained that the things I'd witnessed – the terrifying encounters with the Ijiraq, talking ravens, the monstrous transformation of Becca – were all products of my poisoned mind. They weren't real. They couldn't have been real.

I wanted to believe them, I really did. It was easier to accept that I'd simply been hallucinating than to confront the horror of what I thought I had witnessed. The people at the research station, the villagers – they were all victims of a terrible accident, not some supernatural force. It was tragic, but it was rational. It was something I could understand.

But there were things I just couldn't shake, things that didn't fit neatly into their hydrogen sulfide theory. The village, for instance. Yes, they'd found the burned-out remains of the settlement, but not a single trace of the villagers themselves. Search parties had painstakingly combed the surrounding area for days, enduring the harsh elements, all in vain. Not a single body was recovered. Thirty people just don't disappear without a trace, not even in a harsh, frozen landscape like this one. Where were the bodies? Why weren't there any signs of a struggle, or of the panicked flight they described?

And then there was Becca. The recovery team found the inuksuk I'd constructed for her, but when they'd opened it, expecting to recover her body, they found it empty. There were bare human footprints, leading from the cairn to the sea. Footprints that, according to the weather records, were made days after the gas cloud had dissipated. How was it possible? How could a dead woman, encased in a tomb of ice and stone, simply walk away?

**July 7, 2023**

In the aftermath of the horrifying events at Outpost Aurora, the authorities declared the entire area a disaster zone. The high levels of residual toxins, along with the lingering risk of additional leaks from the deserted drilling site, rendered the area too hazardous for habitation.

The remoteness of the disaster allowed the subsequent relocation of the surviving Inuit tribes to be done clandestinely. During this period, I was consumed by a profound sense of guilt and duty to assist my people. As an Inuit and as one of the few survivors of the incident, I felt a deep connection and responsibility to those who had also lost so much.

I worked tirelessly to help facilitate the relocations, ensuring that my people were moved safely, with dignity, and with as little disruption to their way of life as possible. I provided guidance on cultural norms, tradition, and practices, ensuring they were preserved and respected in the relocation process.

During this period, I also found the strength to return to my academic pursuits. I completed my PhD in Anthropology, my dissertation focusing on the resilience of Inuit societies in the face of severe climatic and socio-cultural disruptions.

After the completion of my doctorate, I realized I no longer had the stomach for field research. The trauma of what had unfolded had left deep imprints on my psyche, making the once thrilling prospect of Arctic exploration a haunting reminder of the fragility of life. Instead, I moved back to Anchorage to accept a university lecturer position and have tried to live as normal a life as possible.

Yet, even as I carve out this new path, my past remains with me, especially in the wintertime, when snow falls like a blanket over the city, obscuring everything in a shroud of white. On these nights, I often find myself drawn to the coast. I walk along the shoreline, gazing out over the frost-kissed waters, half-expecting to see a figure emerging from the icy depths.

Becca – or rather, the thing she became. Her memory lingers, a ghost in the snow, a specter in the sea foam.
