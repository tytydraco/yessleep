# Prologue

As a 15-year-old boy in 2015, I had a lot of mixed feelings about summer break. Part of me was ready to finish school and homework and run to the hills of freedom. The other part knew that this would be the last time I would see any of my friends until next year. Which also means it's just gonna be me, my parents, and my younger brother. We live in a small town about 20 miles away from the school I go to. There was a school here at one point, but I believe it burned down. Our town didn't have enough money or something to build a new one, so the city over made a deal where they would start letting kids from our redneck town enroll in theirs, and just like that, a 30-minute bus ride, just me and my brother.

There were no kids here, just Devon and me. I didn't have a phone or a computer yet, so I didn't have any way to occupy my young, adventurous mind or keep in touch with others. On top of that, my parents work hard at a pig farm; they were both managers in different parts of the farm, so I didn't see them much. When ever they are home they don't have a chance in hell to deal with our bullshit of which we had buckets full. This one time, I carved a bow and arrow from a small apple tree I cut from one of our town's many abandoned houses. Turns out my dad knew that guy who owns the house, and that tree was the owner's son's tree, who just died of cancer a day before. My parents were rightfully disappointed, so as punishment, I was to stay indoors when they weren't around. My dad let me keep the bow. I think a piece of him was proud that I had made the bow all by myself, and even remarked '' You might even be able to bag a buck with this if you can get close enough."

A week later, I shot into my bedroom door to see if I could. And to be honest, I have no idea if it can kill a deer but it sure can fuck up a door. Arrows would fly through the door like a round from a railgun, ramming itself through a 3-inch sheet of depleted uranium, piercing itself into the wall inside my room. He took it, obviously, and to this day, that door has 30 arrow holes. Our town and the towns around us also started reporting an increasing rise in missing kids, so this temporary jail became permanent. So, needless to say, I had a lot of free time. But this summer was going to be different. My next-door neighbors had agreed with our parents to keep an eye on us when they were not around. This way, we could go outside and be free, but we had to ask for permission first. The Waters were very nice to Devon and me. They treated us with the same love and care as they would their own. They were an old couple who paid me occasionally for taking out the trash and mowing the Lawns, Etc.

Mrs Waters or Ernie was like a grandfather to me, he would teach me about life with tales of his own and tell me about his time in the army. He liked to make stuff. and would sometimes have me help. He's the one who showed me how to make a bow, but now that's a secret we don't tell my parents. We met them through their grandson, who sometimes comes and visits them. He was also part of the deal. His name was Jake, but only Ernie called him that. We called him JJ. He was over positive, but not so much that it was overbearing, just tolerable. he liked sports, girls, and dirtbikes, and our town offered us none. So we would hang out at his grandparents' house and the nearby woods. He liked the idea of us all being by ourselves at my house, he said it was cool because we could do whatever we wanted. Quickly, he found out how boring my place is. We had a TV for entertainment, and that was it. But he had a phone with YouTube and an Xbox, which also meant we had more freedom and could travel further than before in both the real-life world and the digital world. If we needed help, JJ could always call for help if we needed it. Or so we thought.

# Part 1

I'll never forget that summer. It's what made me, and why I can't trust anyone again. I was sitting in my last hour bio class, drawing, and talking to my friend Sean. We'd often play this game where someone draws a picture of a man, girl, or just a stick man, dog thing, and pass it to each other. Anytime it was passed back, you would add something to the drawing. This almost always lead to a big dick nazi with a drinking problem and just so happens to like cowboy hats don't ask I have no idea why.

"Bro, I think she likes me," Sean said with his head down, drawing some little hairs on our soon to be cowboy nazi rod.

*"What, who?"* I said, confused.

*"You know, Haven,*" Sean said as he passed the paper to me.

*"Haven, isn't the girl who just got with Ricky?"* I said with a smirk.

Sean, clearly upset, put his head down and tried to say something before being interrupted by Mrs. Feather.

"Draven, Sean, that better be notes and not a you know what on a Russian bear."

*"It's not, it's notes,"* I said nervously.

*"Then, why are you passing it around?"* she said with a got ya look on her face.

*"I just had a question about viruses,"* I said in a rush.

*"Well, go on, what's the question?"* She said with an annoying face. I couldn't think of anything. Sean looked just as lost as I was. He wasn't going to help any, so in a panic, I said,

*"What is a virus?"* A kid I didn't know, or rather didn't care to know, a couple of desks back, yelled

*"Sure, that's such a dumb question, give her the paper."* And what felt like the entire school laughed. Sean lowered his head further into his arms from the second-hand embarrassment. The kid even doubled down and said,

"A *virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent*Â that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. *We just read that a few chapters back.*" Thankfully, Mrs. Feathers must have realized I was getting eaten alive, because she stepped in.

*"Thank you, David, but I think Draven is asking what a virus classifies as, in terms of a living organism, right?"*

*"Sure?"* I shrugged, having no idea what she was talking about. But I knew if I went along with Mrs. Feather, she would keep the wolves away.

"That's an intriguing question, Most biologists say a virus doesn't fit into any of the 7 classifications of living organisms. They are not made of cells, they don't grow or make their own energy, or even keep themselves in a stable state of being." She stated

*"So they're not alive,"* I ask\*.\*

*"We don't know for sure because they have goals and can, in a way, be born and die."* She shrugged.

*"So, what are they?"* David asked with wide eyes.

*"A bunch of proteins and genetic material that want to live and replicate inside you. I heard they can rewrite your DNA,"* said one of the other kids in the class.

*"No, well, some," the final bell interrupts her, "but we will talk about this next year."* Sean and I darted out of class just in case she wanted to see the little drawing still.

*"That was close,"* I said, moving closer to Sean in the hall.

*"Nah, it's the last day of school, what's she gonna do, kick us out? Anyway, if I get a car over the summer, I'll come and see you and we can hang out and go to that hole."* Sean said quickly as he walked away from me and over to Ricky. Not wanting any part of it, I made my way to the bus.

I looked into the blueish grayish sky and the many empty corn fields our long bus ride had to offer. I thought about what he said about how he would come and hang out if he got a car. I didn't even think about it, but he was about to turn 16 in a few days. And his parents would most likely get him one. Not that he was spoiled or anything like that. It's that Sean's life had always been cruel to him. From birth, death was already trying to take him. he had a bad liver and had trouble breathing. And at that age, finding a new liver would be almost impossible. All the doctor thought for sure he wouldn't make it to three months. he made it four years before they were finally able to fix him up. He was there, little miracle, and they would do anything for him. But the hole, what does it mean? I chalked it up to maybe I misunderstood him, but I had a weird feeling like I was forgetting something, something important. Whatever it was, my quiet thinking was interrupted by a super pumped Devon.

*"Dude, I can't wait. Do you think JJ will be there when we get home?"*

*"Probably not, he has to get ready, plus we don't know when he gets home from school,"* I said, still looking out at the passing world. "

*"Yeah, probably an hour or something," Devon* said while relaxing his jumpy body in the seat behind me. right before springing back up. *"Do you think he has Minecraft on his Xbox?"*

*"I hope so,"* the ride came and went, and before you know it, we were home, and to our surprise, he was already in our house with Mr. and Mrs. Waters.

*"We thought we would get everything ready for you kids while you were at school."* Mrs Waters said in a cloud of smoke from her cigarette at the dinner table.

*"Yup, we picked up Jake here, early so y'all can get to your fooling quicker,"* Ernie said with a smile, sliding his hands into the top of his overalls and leading back into the seat next to her. Mrs. Waters extinguished her cigarette into my mother's ashtray and stood up.

*"Alright, we're gonna head out. If you need anything, you know what to do, and please, Draven and Devon, don't knock, just come in, you scare me every time,"* she said on her way out the door. Ernie, not far behind her, chimed in,

*"Yeah, knocking means only cops and salesmen. Now if you boys wantcha a Sodapop or if you get hungry, come by, food will be ready at 5."* We thank them on their way out.

As soon as the door shut, Devon and JJ started a game of Black Ops 2 Zombies, a video game we weren't allowed to play. Well, we weren't allowed to play any video games. But our parents would let it slide if a kid brought a console over, which didn't happen much. But never shooting games, to our surprise, Devon and I were awful at shooting games.

*"Why are you guys not training?"* JJ shouted as I went down for the seventh time.

*"Dude, it's just a game, and we can't train; we don't have an Xbox,"* I said, confused. JJ snapped his head to me,

*"The zombies, train the zombies," Jj said frantically.*

*"Sounds pretty gay,"* Devon said in a low voice.

*"Alright, whatever, let's play something different, you guys need a little more practice,*" JJ said.

*"I thought we were doing ok,"* I said in a low tone.

*"It's round 3,"* JJ said, annoyed.

*"Let's play Minecraft,"* Devon pleaded. JJ bounced the idea around in his head for a bit before saying

*"No, I was thinking about going outside."*

*"And do what?"* I asked.

*"I don't know, hang out in the woods, maybe go to the hole,"* JJ said. There it was again, the hole.

*"What are they talking about?"* I said with a confused look on my face.

*"Yeah, I forgot that we're going to turn it into a clubhouse,"* Devon said, shooting out of the couch.

Just like that, it hit me. Across the gravel road, just behind our house, was a cornfield. If you walked straight for a few acres, you'd find a wall of trees that separates our life from the natural one. You'll find a knee-deep pond consumed with moss and trees too old and stubborn to die. And if you continue uphill, there's a large, old, weeping willow, its roots spread vast and far, most of which were visible due to natural erosion, they weaved and knotted themselves in such a way that no human hands could ever hope to recreate. truly hard to put into words.  Just a few feet in front of it, there's a hole.

It's about 12 feet deep. The first 5 feet down is just big enough to fit through, with plenty of loose roots and rocks to grab onto, then opens to a large pocket. Just big enough to be a clubhouse. You can see all the roots that hold the dirt up. And it's just as beautiful below as it was above. The smaller roots droop down with little chunks of dirt stuck to smaller roots branching off them. *"How could I've forgotten that? I don't remember telling anyone about it. I've only been there once by myself."*

*"I don't know,"* JJ said, with a smile, looking at me. Pulling me from my train of thought, *"Draven could be lying."*

*"No, it's real. I've been there. I don't know when, but it's there."* I said confidently

*"Then, show us,"* JJ said with a look on his face like he didn't believe me.

*"I tried, and I found nothing. I found the pound you were talking about, but there was no tree, no hole.*" Devon added.

*"I don't even remember telling you guys about this,"* I said.

*"Well, you did, show us,"* they both began chatting, *"show us show us!"*

*"Fine, let's go,"* I said while walking to the door.

*"Alright, but you're going over there to ask them,"* Devon quickly said, putting his finger on his nose to show he was no go.

*"No, it's fine, I've already texted them and told them we were going to the woods, and they said we were good to go,"* JJ said, shaking his iPhone in his hand.

*"Hell ya, let's go,"* Devon said excitedly. So we made our way across the road and into the corn.

*"I'm so glad the corn isn't grown yet it would suck to have walk throw that shit,"*  Jj said walking next to me.

*"Well, you'd better be ready because soon we're going to be walking in this every day,"* I said while looking into the freshly plowed field.

*"Sure,"* said Devon.

*"Hey, there are the trees,"* I said. This surprised me because I wasn't sure if I made it up.

*"Ohhh, trees,"* JJ said, *"I'm so impressed."*

"*Shut up,"* I said, looking at the large amount of tall, skinny black locust trees, it was not like I remembered. It looked about right, the walk felt shorter, but I don't remember this many trees. They were so close together, anywhere from a foot apart to so close they might as well be one.

*"Watch out for the thorns there, everywhere,"* Devon said, pulling some from his arm after just three steps in the maze-like woods,

*"Well, yeah no shit there locust trees,"* I said with a little laugh.

*"I DONT GIVE A FUCK."* He said, looking done with this already.

*"Here, let me lead,"* I said, brushing by him as he looked at his arm. We continued, walking into every thorn along the way before coming into a rather large clearing that I don't remember as well, but there it was.

The pond and its moss and the willow just up the hill.

*"Must have been the wrong pond,"* Devon said, taking it all in.

*"Ok, now where is the hole?"* JJ said with his arms out?

*"This is the Show Me State after all."* Said Jj.

*Hold up, it's up there, alright."* I said, pointing at the willow on the hill. As we walked closer, you could start to make out the roots' handy work, I almost jumped up with excitement. My walk turned into a happy little run. They tried to keep up, but I was there in a flash. And there it was,  the hole.
