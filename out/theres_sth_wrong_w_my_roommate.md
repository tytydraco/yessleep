First, English isn't my first language so please excuse my grammar or any mistake.
Final terms(exam) were near so i have to stay in my college hostel. So i started living w 2 new friends in one of the drom room. Well i really don't know them. But they were really friendly. Let's name (eva) for my weird roommate. The other roommate was fine let's say her(anne).

 The first week went very well everything seems fine.we three got to know each other. Last Sunday anne received call from her parents . Her grandma died so she has to go to her home for like a week i guess. She went home and now me and eva are in the room. So lately i started noticing some weird things about eva . It's been few days since anne went home. The first day eva was quiet and she was also zoning out for few times. I didn't think too much i just ignored and started reading. 

I thought she needs time Until it's night. She suddenly started talking a lot and asking me about the paranormal activities that I've ever faced on my life. I was kinda scared like she was so sudden. The next day was also same she was quiet and all of a sudden she started talking a lot. And next morning i woke up with pain and scratch in my arm. My bed was above Eva's bed like it is attached (two story bed i guess). I called Eva for help because it was really painful (my arm). She didn't listen. I went down from my bed she wasn't there. 

I thought she went for class but there were no classes to attend at that time(4am). It's winter so it was so cold dark and fog outside. So she can't go outside it's obvious. I checked the bathroom she wasn't there and when i was returning to my bed i saw eva sleeping in her bed. The door was still closed i didn't hear any sound of opening or closing. The window was also shut. I was really scare at that moment. How did she get there..i searched her everywhere in our room even in bathrooms.

 And most scary part she then suddenly opened her eyes and started me. She wasn't looking me she was looking through me like there's sth behind me . I could see the fear in her eyes. And again she closed her eyes so fast i tried to wake her up although i was scared. But she didn't wake up.i went to bed because there were still few hours left for classes. Those few hours were really nightmare for me . I could feel somebody's watching me from the corner of the room in the dark. 

I tried to sleep but i couldn't. Eva was just below my bed.
Finally it's morning 6am and i wake up put my dress collected my books and came out of my room before eva.
I told all these incidents to our hostel's teacher. She believed me and told me to stay carefully. She was somehow scared too. And i didn't talk about my arm to any one not even w the teacher. I didn't talk w eva all day .we barely met each other today in class. Our classes were over i went to my room changed my dress and went to cafeteria for some food .

 And there i met eva, she was staring me it was so creepy. She was sitting alone and asked me to join her. I joined her after all she's still my roommate. And suddenly she asked me about how my arm is. I was totally freaked out because i haven't told about my arm to anyone i even wore full sleeve clothes so that they couldn't see my arm. I didn't gave answer because i was too stunned. She repeated her questions but in very serious tone this time. 

Then i lied saying it's ok now. She made a face like she knew i was lying. And she then asked how that happened i lied again saying i mistakenly fell in bathroom. Then she shouted at me in front of whole cafeteria "STOP LYING I KNOW EVERYTHING".

I was so panicked couldn't think of anything I don't even know how that happened and she is telling me she knows everything when she was sleeping like a dead person at that time.I run to my room and started rethinking everything.
Now I'm writing this sitting in my study table. I don't know what's happening.


"DOOR OPENS"
EVA ENTERS THE ROOM AND STARTS TO STARE THROUGH THE WINDOW NEXT TO ME.
"Be careful today's night anything can happen" SHE SAID IN A VERY LOW VOICE AND WENT OUTSIDE. 
i don't really know what will happen today and what should I do now ???
