They dragged us down a hidden stairwell that smelled of rust and pus, into a cavity the architects had never intended, a wound in the mall itself. The walls narrowed and the air grew hotter, the sound of dripping liquid echoing with maddening persistence. My lungs struggled, every breath clogged with the odor of charred plastic and putrefying meat.

At the core we found the source. A tumor of flesh filled the chamber wall to wall, pulsing and sputtering like an organ cut loose from its host. Its surface was a swollen landscape, glistening with translucent blisters that wept yellow pus in steady drops. Golden tubes, crude and countless, pierced its hide, their clear walls filled with fluids both dark and glowing; nutrients or poisons, it hardly mattered. The monster’s breaths were wheezes, cavernous and ancient, drawn from lungs far larger than the room could hold. It stank of rotting seawater and sweet decay, of something preserved past the limits of time. The floor beneath it quivered with each pulse, and I realized with horror that the mall itself was feeding this thing, its bones and walls nothing more than scaffolding for the living mass.

We were thrown to our knees before it, the others bowed low in rhythmic spasms, their movements synchronized like worshippers at some grotesque liturgy. Josh stood upright, his eyes now black pools that reflected no light. The tumor shifted, and I thought I glimpsed faces pressing outward from its surface, stretched thin as parchment; teachers, facilitators, students, all absorbed, their mouths opening in silent screams that merged into the low bass of the creature’s breathing. I could not move. The Zone Rangers flanked me, equally paralyzed, their eyes reflecting the pale ooze as if transfixed by an alien moon.

As it turned its unseen attention upon me, I felt the carousel’s song rise again from the ducts above, cheerful and inhuman, summoning me to ride forever.

Ernie, trembling but unwilling to bow, raised a broken pipe like a spear. His voice cracked as he shouted,  
“We’re not letting you take him!”

He rushed Josh with desperate strength, the echo of his cry swallowed almost instantly by the chamber’s hungry acoustics. But Josh, no longer entirely human, caught him with unnatural grace and hurled him against the fleshy bulk. The surface split willingly to accept him, membranes stretching like lips. Ernie’s scream curdled the air as he was engulfed, the sound muffled into wet gurgles that rose and fell like a drowning hymn. The tumor convulsed, its tubing throbbing as if in ecstatic response. A moment later, Ernie stumbled back out, but changed; his face now sliding and twitching in that same inhuman rhythm, skin crawling as if it remembered other owners. His eyes flickered recognition, then drowned in madness. He lunged at us with a strangled roar, a puppet of the flesh.

The cavern descended into chaos, a symphony of wrenching steel and rupturing flesh that seemed to rattle the bones of the entire mall. Bella struck the mass with her wrench again and again, each swing cracking bone-like ridges and severing pulsating tubing, the clangs ringing out like church bells tolling for the damned. The air filled with the stink of burned meat and corroded metal, thick and unbreathable, every lungful tearing at my throat. Zane lashed at Josh with a length of cable, his hands trembling but his aim true, sparks jumping where metal met wet hide, the arcs illuminating Josh’s face; wide, impossible, stretching his face like an oil slick. Both Josh and the other’s movements no longer belonged to a man, but to a marionette jerked by unholy strings, their limbs twitching and snapping in angles that mocked Josh’s exact movements.

I scurried along the walls, desperately sliding my hands across the wall until I felt corroded panels still alive with flickering lights. Buttons and dials pulsed faintly as though feeding the monstrous tumor at the chamber’s heart. Each switch I flipped seemed to awaken another scream in the ducts, another convulsion from the mass that anchored itself to the mall. The sound was unbearable, thousands of voices woven into a single, mind-shattering note. The ducts groaned, shaking loose rust and dust like the coughing lungs of an ancient god. My panic deepened as I realized the very building was breathing with us, breathing against us.

We moved as one despite our terror, desperation soldering our mismatched souls into a single will to survive. Bella jammed the wrench deep into a main valve, twisting with all her strength until steam hissed like a dying breath and rivets popped from the walls like bullets. Zane ripped free the tubing in fistfuls, rancid fluids spraying in every direction, coating us in a stench that clung to skin and soul. The liquid burned on contact, leaving welts that pulsed in time with the creature’s own heartbeat. Josh shrieked, his voice overlapping itself in impossible harmonies, and lunged at me with jerking steps. I slammed my hand down on the fire alarm, its shriek echoing like a judgment trumpet across every level of the mall. The sound did not merely fill the air, it filled our bones, shaking our marrow, summoning echoes from corridors that had never known human voices. Josh and his cronies were no less affected, holding their misshapen ears in agony.

The walls trembled as if the mall itself was rising from slumber. From every vent came the carousel music, thin and warbling, a child’s tune drawn out into a dirge. I could see it in my mind, the carousel spinning in the darkness, rods piercing bodies that bounced in dreadful rhythm, eternally rising and falling to music no longer meant for joy.

We pressed forward, each action tearing at the heart of the thing. Flames erupted where cables sparked, setting banners and plastic drapes alight. The tumor writhed, its surface splitting open to reveal faces; facilitators, classmates, custodians, etched in transparent flesh, their mouths wide in soundless screams that merged into the alarm’s shriek. My stomach turned as I recognized some of them, those who had zeroed-out, now eternally grafted to the flesh, absorbed into its immortality. Their eyes rolled endlessly, following us in cycles as if trapped in a living ledger, tallying our every sin.

The chamber buckled. Fluorescent lights exploded in showers of glass and mercury, plunging us into a strobe-lit nightmare. Josh lunged again, but Bella swung the wrench one last time with a guttural scream, striking his temple. His head twisted too far, snapping like a hinge, yet his body continued to stagger toward us. Zane looped the cable around his limbs, jerking hard until bone cracked like kindling. Still Josh lunged, a distorted hymn echoing from his throat until the collapsing wall crushed him, silencing him in a spray of red mist. The creature howled, its voice not of one throat but of a million, echoing across dimensions, a vibration that seemed to pulse beyond the mall, beyond the county, perhaps even beyond the world.

The flesh mound writhed in agony, its tubes thrashing like serpents, its blisters bursting in explosive sprays of pus. Its howl was not a single voice but thousands; facilitators, students, janitors, all howling in overlapping despair, a chorus that rattled teeth and spine. The mall above began to burn, flames devouring banners, kiosks, pods, every false edifice of commerce and learning. Alarms wailed, sprinklers failed, and in their place came jets of blood-tinged water, spattering the screaming walls. The air reeked of charred plastic, ozone, and rot. The thing bellowed through every duct and corridor, its cry echoing in thousands of throats across the LearningZone, as though the whole student body had become its choir. Lights shattered, escalators collapsed, glass storefronts imploded in showers of shards. The mall itself seemed intent on swallowing us with its death throes.

“Through here!” yelled Zane, “This should lead us out.”

We scrambled into a storm pipe, the metal rattling under the mall’s convulsions, bolts loosening as though reality itself sought to spit us out. The tunnel vibrated like the throat of a colossal beast, hot gusts of air propelling us forward as if we were phlegm expelled by some titanic cough. Behind us the mass screamed again, and I swear I felt the sound as fingers dragging down my spine, promising we were only escaping a fragment of its body.

At last, we tumbled out of the pipe onto the shoulder of the highway, gasping under the indifferent night sky. The air smelled clean, a cruelty after what we had left. Cars slowed, headlights sweeping over our ruined faces, their occupants staring as if we were revenants risen from tar. None stopped; they accelerated instead, unwilling to risk contagion of whatever we carried. Behind us the Eastbrook Mall roared with fire, its glass ceiling collapsing inward in sheets of molten light.

Embers ascended like unmoored souls, drifting heavenward before vanishing into the dark. The flames painted the horizon crimson, and for a fleeting instant it seemed as though dawn itself had arrived to cleanse the world.

We stood there, the three of us, watching our prison collapse into ash. Bella’s hands still clenched the wrench, knuckles white, as though she feared letting go would invite the thing to reclaim her. Zane’s goggles reflected the inferno, and in their lenses, I thought I glimpsed faces dancing in the flames, not consumed but waiting. My own reflection in the highway guardrail showed eyes wider than I thought possible, pupils dilated into endless black, and I knew the carousel’s rhythm still turned inside me. Yet the silence between heartbeats whispered of unfinished horrors. It wasn’t destroyed, not truly. I couldn’t shake the thought that somewhere beneath the ruins, in the depths no flame could cleanse, that thing might still twitch, dreaming of us, dreaming of others, its roots stretching unseen to every LearningZone that had replaced every dead mall across the nation. The carousel would keep spinning, and sooner or later, we would be called back to ride.
