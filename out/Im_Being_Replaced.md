I know the title sounds crazy. Hell, I may be crazy. But I need someone to know this before I'm gone.

It all started last month, when  my friends and I went on a birthday roadtrip across Texas. We were all 21 (or older) now, so we barhopped frequently and put our livers to work. But nevermind that- The issue didn't start there. It started when I was driving late one night, I was the designated driver; the most sober of the bunch. We stopped in a little town I can't remember the name of. It was foresty and empty, lines of towering pine trees swaying in the gentle wind. I was driving at a slow pace, but it still seemed like a long while before I finally parked the van in an empty lot. The pavement was cracked and worn, and there weren't any buildings nearby that I could tell. I put the van in park and looked out the windshield. A sense of curiosity befell me, seeing the vast dark with trees just out of view. Impulsively, I decided to scope out the area. Everyone was sleeping, so I didn't see any reason not to. I crept out of the RV and into the darkness.

Using my phone as a flashlight, I scanned the area. What I saw was nothing but trees and more trees. Above was a star filled sky without light to corrupt it, constellations in their ever present poses, staring down at me with twinkling eyes.The chill of the night hit me then, and I felt a bit paranoid about coyotes or bears- nothing I couldn't ignore. Though a bit on edge, I walked around the parking lot, taking effort not to step into the grass. My gaze met a fence line in the distance. It was just barely out of range of my light, and directly behind the RV. I mean, a bit of trespassing couldn't hurt, could it? You can probably guess how wrong I was, based on the very nature of this post.

Anyway. I jumped the fence. On the other side, my sneakers sunk into muddy soil. I aimed my phone forward. Surrounded by brush and cattails, a small pond lay enclosed entirely within the fence. From what I could tell, its borders didn't extend much beyond it. I looked into the murky water, taking steps closer to it. It was then that I noticed a faint glow, at the top of my vision. I don't know how I missed it. I looked up, and jolted in surprise, though I was unable to run. I was frozen, staring at it. "It", or perhaps I should say "she", was floating above the water, her bare form glowing faintly. She was emitting light- her skin so pale it glowed, with long white hair wet and silky. I blinked. She remained. Her face was an assortment of features that one could only describe as beautiful- though like in a dream, you couldn't entirely pinpoint her features.

She flew towards me. I tried to run, but my feet got stuck in the mud, pulling me to the floor in wet disgust. I stared up at her, on my side, feeling like prey to something vile. Despite the beauty, I knew it was wrong. So wrong. I can't explain what she was, or if she was even real. I held my breath, and she came beside me. Kneeling, she took my face in her hands. The warmth of them radiated throughout my body, and they were soft. She spoke to me softly. I couldn't make out the words, her voice was like bells and pitches all overlaid into one, ringing pleasantly yet indecipherable in language. My heart felt as though it was trying to escape from my ribs. I didn't fight back despite every molecule of me screaming to run. I took a breath again as she leaned down to kiss my forehead, and suddenly all went black.

I woke up soaking wet. I was on the floor of the van, morning seeping out the windows. Everyone was asleep. I sat up, rubbing my eyes before I remembered what I'd seen. The fear hit me like a bus, and I looked around carefully, examining each crevice and each face carefully as to make sure she wasn't hiding. I got to my feet quickly. I couldn't wake them- not when I had no idea whether or not what happened was real. Not when I was a sopping mess, hyperventilating and cold.

I was hesitant to get out of the van again, but I did, bringing my change of clothes with me. There was no sign of danger. I wrung my clothes out and shook the water from my hair. My hands were pruned with moisture. I put on my new clothes and tried to step inside the van, but something stopped me. An intense nausea crawled its way up my stomach and to my throat. I swallowed, trying to keep it down, but it forced its way through me, and murky water escaped my mouth and splattered on the pavement below. I stood there, dizzy, looking at the reflection of the sky in dirty water. Water. I couldn't understand why it was water. Something within me told me that this was a secret, something sickly and horrible that no one should know.

I ignored that instinct. That afternoon, when my friends were up and I was 50 miles out of that town, I told them. We were eating McDonald's breakfast and lounging as they tried to nurse their hangovers.

"I saw something last night," I think I said. "Something paranormal."

Amy laughed, trying not to choke on her hashbrown. "What?"

Jeremy and Heather looked at me the same way. They didn't believe me.

"I swear I saw something. It-" The words escaped me. I felt my memories of it fade, and all that left was lingering fear.

"Look, dude. Don't be scared, it was probably just a deer." 

The conversation didn't go on much longer than that. I remembered the event once I was finally home, when other symptoms began to show.

It started with an itch. My skin felt endlessly uncomfortable, and I scratched my arms raw before I realized I should stop. I booked a doctor's appointment the next day.

My doctor had nothing to say. He prescribed me an anti-itch cream, and sent me on my way, even after I tried to tell him something was seriously wrong. 

He said, "Get some better sleep," And I did. But within my dreams, the thing called to me, its language I could never decipher.

It was slow-paced suffering until the third day; that's when the next symptoms began to show. Now I hear ringing bells- soft, like distant wind chimes forever swayed by a gentle breeze. My vision blurred with every note, and I could no longer sleep. The sound consumed my mind entirely. It kept me up until I was too exhausted to open my eyes. 

Whatever sickness this was, it was going to kill me. I'd decided that within a week of my infection. My brain felt- feels like it's deteriorating, each hour another memory fades. I wake up in the middle of doing things- calling my parents, writing notes, scrolling through my photos. It's like I'm pulled back into lucidity by my own, fading will to survive. Texts get answered before I get the chance to. Nobody seems worried at all. It seems like, whatever it is, is stealing my body and my mind entirely. This brings us to today; the day I'm sure I will die.

It's not a kind of death where one would find my body, rotting in my bed, mush on the mattress. It's a death of my mind, my consciousness, my soul. It ate away at every piece of me, gathering all the information it could until I had nothing left. Nothing but fading memories of who I love are. I can feel that it's all gone now. I can't remember my mother's face.

I just want to be held again.
