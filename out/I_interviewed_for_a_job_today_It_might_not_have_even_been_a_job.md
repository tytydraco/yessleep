I am in a small elevator filled with too much air. The walls are wood-plated. The floor buttons do not have numbers.

Next to me stands a chubby man with a red tie and blue suit.

Hell of a storm out there, he says. I blink at him as I parse his words, with the knowledge that the skies have been clear all day. I nod at him, and he shrugs, hitting an unlabeled button and turning around to face the corner. I don’t know what color his eyes are. The elevator trawls upward.

The doors open after what seem like minutes, revealing a waiting room. The walls are beige, but they have some cigarette burns on them. On one of the walls is a poster of a cat hanging from a tree branch. Kill Yourself! The bubbly text on the bottom reads.

The man in the blue suit looks at it and begins to laugh. It’s a wet, scoffy laugh. Where is the bathroom, he asks the secretary through happy tears. The secretary points towards a nearby door with a cartoon man on it, and the man in the blue suit shuffles through the door. His laughter is now muffled and much louder.

Please have a seat, the secretary says. He’s filling out some kind of form, but when I look down at it, there’s no ink coming out of the pen. I follow his instructions.

Are you the guy? The voice echoes. I look up from my thumbs and there is an unnaturally tall man standing by the secretary’s desk. His shoulders almost struggle to hold the weight of his massive skull. We had spoken on the phone a few days ago.

I nod and get out of my seat. Big-Head-Man shrinks into himself out of instinct, but quickly returns to his original stature. The secretary is sweating, I can see it from where I stand now.

Big-Head-Man leads me down the hallway, and as I pass the bathroom, I hear him choking. The man is choking.

\--

Congratulations, he says, and extends a clammy hand towards me. It’s a little too close to my face because his arms are so very long. Is he going to boop me on the nose? I shake it quickly and firmly and when I let go his hand stays out a second longer than it should.

I’ve got a phone call to make, he says, but I trust you can escort yourself to your office. Once you leave this room, make three right turns, one left turn, and when you see a hallway, go ahead and turn down.

Turn down? I ask him.

Turn down, he says. Turn down into the floor.

How do I turn down into the floor? I nod and leave his office because I will figure it out when I need to. My back is turned to him as I exit the room and I hear someone getting out of their chair. I turn around and he’s readjusting his position. He gives me a little grin and a nod.

I make the three right turns and one left turn. There are footsteps behind me. The man is still choking in the bathroom. I hear snickering. I’m at the hallway. Turn down? Why are there no numbers? Kill Yourself!

I don’t put my arms out to break my fall as I hit the floor. There’s a wet little crack and just like that something warm is on my nose. There’s laughter behind me.

Oh my god, Big-Head-Man says behind me. Oh my god, he actually did it. We like to joke around here but I didn’t think you’d actually follow through.

I force myself to laugh a little because I need this job very badly. May I use the bathroom, I ask. He nods slowly.

The man in the blue suit isn’t in the bathroom anymore. I wash the blood off my face and in the mirror I can see another poster behind me. It’s got the same branch on it as the one in the waiting room, but the cat isn’t on it anymore.

It’s time to get to work.
