I’ve always loved the woods. The way the trees close in, muffling the world, feels like stepping into a secret no one else knows. My girlfriend, Lena, didn’t share my obsession—she’d rather dissect a murder podcast than tromp through dirt. But I’d begged her for weeks, and she finally caved. A camping trip, just the two of us, deep in the forest a few hours from town. No phones, no noise—just us and the wild. I’d texted my brother, Jake, our coordinates before we left, a habit from years of solo hikes. You never know.

The first night was everything I’d hoped. We fumbled with the tent stakes, laughing as they bent under our clumsy hands. I built a fire, the flames crackling as we roasted hot dogs on sticks. Lena’s dark hair glowed in the light, and she smirked, saying, “Okay, fine, this isn’t terrible.” We fell asleep to the creek’s gentle gurgle, her head on my chest. For a moment, I thought I’d converted her.

Then morning hit, and the world went quiet.

I woke up to nothing. No birds chirping, no leaves rustling—just a thick, suffocating silence pressing against the tent. I unzipped the flap and found Lena crouched by the dead fire, her knees pulled tight to her chest, staring into the trees.

“Eli,” she whispered as I stumbled out, “you hear that?”

I rubbed my eyes, squinting at the gray dawn. “Hear what?”

“That’s the thing,” she said, her voice barely audible. “There’s *nothing*. No sound at all.”

I forced a laugh, trying to shake the unease creeping up my spine. “Maybe the forest’s just hungover. Let’s eat and hike it off.”

She didn’t smile back. Her brown eyes flicked to the trees, wide and unblinking. “It’s not right, Eli. It feels… wrong.”

I ignored the prickle on my neck and dug into our granola bars. But as we ate, I couldn’t shake it the silence wasn’t natural. It was like the woods were holding their breath, watching us.

We packed light and followed the creek, my boots sinking into the damp earth. About a mile in, we stumbled on it: a cabin. It squatted in a clearing, its wood blackened with age, windows boarded with splintered planks. The roof sagged, moss choking the shingles, and a rusted padlock dangled loosely on the door, unlatched.

“Hunter’s shack?” Lena asked, her voice tight as she stepped closer.

“Maybe,” I said, though doubt gnawed at me. No paths led here, no tire tracks or boot prints—just this rotting husk in the middle of nowhere. I nudged the door with my shoulder, and it groaned open.

The air inside hit like a punch damp, sour, laced with decay. Dust coated the single room, swirling in the weak light. A crooked table leaned in the center, one leg shorter than the rest, next to a chair with a cracked seat. In the corner, a trapdoor gaped in the floor, its edges worn smooth. Faint footprints small, child-sized trailed through the dust to its edge.

“Someone’s been here,” Lena said, her breath hitching. She grabbed my arm, nails digging in. “Eli, we shouldn’t be here.”

“Relax,” I said, prying her off. “It’s just an old hideout. Let’s see what’s below, five minutes, then we’re gone.”

“Are you kidding?” she hissed, her voice rising. “This is how people die, you idiot! Trapdoors in creepy cabins don’t lead to treasure they lead to bodies!”

I smirked, grabbing a stick from outside to lift the trapdoor. “You’ve listened to too many podcasts. It’s probably just a cellar. Come on, Lena, live a little.”

She glared, her lips a thin line, but followed me anyway. “If we die, I’m haunting you first.”

The trapdoor creaked open, revealing a ladder vanishing into blackness. A cold gust rushed up, sharp with a metallic tang like blood, I realized too late. I flicked on my flashlight and started down, Lena’s shaky breaths behind me.

The ladder dropped us into a tunnel, the ceiling so low I had to hunch. Dirt walls glistened with moisture, and the air thickened, clogging my lungs. The metallic smell grew stronger, stinging my nose as we shuffled forward.

The tunnel widened into a chamber, and my flashlight beam trembled as it swept the room. Shelves lined the walls, packed with glass jars—dozens, maybe hundreds. Inside, dark liquid sloshed around pale, floating shapes: a lung, a liver, something coiled like intestines. Some had labels scrawled dates and initials, the oldest from 1968. In the center sat a metal table, its surface crusted with dark stains, a leather strap dangling from one edge, stained and frayed.

Lena choked, stumbling back. “Eli, what *is* this?”

“I don’t know,” I stammered, my mouth dry. “Maybe… some psycho’s lab?”

“Lab?” she snapped, her voice shrill. “These are *organs*, you moron! We need to get out now!”

Before I could answer, a sound cut through the silence a low, guttural hum, rolling from deeper in the tunnel. It wasn’t a machine; it was alive, a wet, throaty vibration that made my bones ache.

“Run!” I yelled, shoving her toward the ladder.

We scrambled up, the hum swelling behind us, thick and hungry. I slammed the trapdoor shut, my hands slick with sweat, and we bolted from the cabin. The sound chased us, seeping through the trees, louder with every step. I glanced back nothing but shadows shifting in the doorway.

We didn’t stop at the campsite. I grabbed our packs, Lena snatching the tent poles as the hum grew into a roar. We sprinted down the creek bed, branches clawing at my face. My lungs burned, but I couldn’t slow down—not with that sound drilling into my skull.

“Eli, it’s closer!” Lena screamed, tripping over a root. I hauled her up, her wrist cold and clammy in my grip.

“Don’t look back!” I shouted, though I couldn’t help it. The trees behind us swayed, bending like something massive was shoving through. A shape flickered—tall, hunched, too fast to focus on.

The creek twisted, and we veered onto a ridge, my boots sliding on loose gravel. The hum turned jagged, splitting into wet, clicking growls. Lena sobbed, her legs pumping beside me. “What is it, Eli? What’s after us?”

“I don’t know!” I yelled, my voice cracking. “Just keep moving!”

We hit a ravine, the drop too steep to climb. I spun around, flashlight shaking in my hand. The trees parted, and it stepped out tall, skeletal, its skin glistening like oil. Its face was a hollow mask, eyes black pits, mouth a gaping slit leaking that hum. Jars hung from its bony frame, clinking softly, filled with things that twitched.

Lena screamed, and I threw a rock stupid, desperate. It bounced off the thing’s chest, and the hum spiked, deafening. I grabbed her hand, dragging her along the ravine’s edge. The ground shook as it lunged, claws raking the air where we’d stood.

We ran blind, crashing through brush until the car loomed ahead. I fumbled the keys, the hum so close it rattled my teeth. We dove in, and I floored it, tires spinning on mud before catching. The thing loomed in the rearview, shrinking as we hit the highway.

We didn’t talk until town. Lena curled in the passenger seat, trembling. “What was that, Eli?” she whispered finally.

“I don’t know,” I said, gripping the wheel. “But it’s over. We’re safe.”

I was wrong.

That night, at 3 a.m., my phone buzzed. A text from Jake: “You okay? Checked your coordinates—no cabin on any map.” Then an audio file. I played it, and the hum poured out—low, alive, recorded from his end, miles away.

Morning came, and Lena was gone. No note, just her shoes by the door, her purse untouched. I’ve been back to the woods twice, alone. The cabin’s there, but the trapdoor’s fused shut, like it’s hiding something. That thing’s jars, its hum they haunt me.

Last night, I woke to the sound again, not in my ears but in my chest, thrumming in my ribs. It’s inside me now, growing. Lena’s gone, and I think it’s been waiting for me all along hunting me from the silence.
