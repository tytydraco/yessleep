Hi

I, a 17 year old, am on vacation in Spain. Me and my family are on vacation in this huge family house in the middle of nowhere. Their are no houses nearby our house. We basically spent the day with chatting, swimming, playing card games and drinking. Every day was the same, until today.

This night I went to bed just like everyone else, the only different thing with this night was that it's 2 hours later than usual. I gotta admit I have drinking a bit myself. So dead tired, I went to sleep with my 2 roommates, my uncle and younger sister. After some laughing for 10 minutes we decided it's time to sleep. 

I woke up 3 hours later while it was still dark outside. I woke up due to a family member standing at the end of my bed. Confused and tired I stand up next to my bed asking what's wrong. He asked me to get a charger upstairs. He asked it stonecold without any emotions. I turned around and reached out to my nightstand to grab my phone. When I turned around he was gone, without making any noice. (For info: their room is the closest to the living room upstairs while my room is the furthest away.) At that point I also realised something else. I could see him, perfectly, even though the room was dark and you couldn't see anything in the dark. Also, the door was closed while he was there, even though it's always open. My roommates also didn't notice anything while they slept unbothered. I thought I was sleepwalking and put my phone back on my nightstand and went back to bed. That was the biggest mistake I could make. While I tried to sleep again I felt something. Something uncomfortable, I felt 2 eyes staring at me. I didn't dare to open my eyes and decided to sleep as fast as I could. It obviously didn't work. It didn't matter to which side I tilted my head, at the right side of my bed I felt his eyes looking at me with his face removed a few inches from mine. At my left side I felt the same, but the only difference is I imagined a gray skinned woman with black hair and no eyes, ready to bite me with her sharp teeth. I couldn't take it anymore and opened my eyes. All I saw was a dark room. The uncomfortable feeling was gone, well... Kinda. I didn't feel sleeping anymore and decided to comfort myself while thinking about everything I liked. Eventually I felt asleep. 

The next morning I woke up like nothing happend. But something was off. I always put a long pillow next to my bed on which I put my clothes. This morning however, it was different. My clothes where exactly how I put them down. The only difference is that my pillow wasn't below them but on top of them. Also my phone was under my pillow in bed. Not on the nightstand where I left it charging.

I can't imagine what happened if I went upstairs. And I know this story might not sound too crazy, that's because it happend to me this night. I am here for more than one week, so I hope it doesn't happen again.

If you ever go to the hills around Barcelona and you get to sleep in a family home surrounded by nothing but tree's. Just know to not follow your family member in the middle of the night if he or she asks you for no logical reason.
