You know that small, obscure café inside of every hospital that serves mediocre at best coffee, cold and hard pastries, and only has one table inside the entirety of it that is dirtier than a literal junkyard? Well, I work there.

The hospital I work at had a weird ass architect, the guy put things that normally would go together (like an operating room next to the emergency room) in complete opposite corners of the hospital, while things that should be far apart (like a church and a morgue) right next to each other. The café, “Cafe Mocha” (not an original name, I’m aware) is directly across from the church. No problem with that, except for the fact that next to the church is the morgue. And across from the morgue, and next to the café, is the daycare center.

Customers will start eating their food inside the café and literally puke it out onto the floor when the body of a motorcyclist cut in half by a truck roll by on a gurney, or a grieving widow will walk out of the church and run right into the body of her husband who died of cancer. Or, a toddler will ask the daycare attendant, “Why is there an arm sticking out of that bag on that rollie-thing?”

It sucks seeing the tragic stories of death roll by into the morgue every day, but I’ve learned to deal with it. Unlike the usual, yesterday was calm. Few customers, but not many, came by ordering miscellaneous things, until eventually 10:00 PM came by.

My routine goes as so, I turn off the machines, throw away the pastries we didn’t sell, collect the tips and split them between me and Nancy (my coworker, but she was sick all week), turn off the lights, and shut the big metal roller door to lock up.

I’m normally out of the hospital by 10:15 PM, but as I was walking toward the exit to the hallway, I heard someone yell out from inside the daycare center.

I turned to my left and saw Lisa trying to quell the anger of some child screaming his lungs out.

Lisas was overworked. Simple as that, she was almost constantly stressed, and eventually her employer made her go on a vacation to cool off. Lisa’s kind though and is great with children. Out of everyone I know in the hospital, she’s probably my best work friend. The first day we met, she ordered a frappuccino and I completely messed up her order, and ended up spilling it all over her blouse. She still uses that against me to this day.

“Charlie, take a deep breath with me, alright?”

“NO! I DON’T WANNA, WHERE’S MY MOM!”

The screaming was... concerning, but I walked in any way to see if I could help.

“Hey, bud, why don’t you play with this for a while.” I said, handing the kid having a hissy fit on the floor my cell phone, already loaded up with Candy Crush.

The boy on the floor, probably five or six, had fluffy brown hair, a pair of dark blue jeans, and a mint hoodie on grabbed my phone from my hand, and his attention immediately was absorbed into the screen.

“Thanks, Aiden.” Lisa said, giving a small smile.

Normally Lisa would have two other attendants helping her out, but it seemed they had left already, leaving her with the brat on the floor. I felt a bad for her, the girl had been left with a literal demon having a temper tantrum that looked like a seizure.

“Hey, you want me to just... chill with you in here while you wait for the kids parents?” I offered.

“Seriously? Oh, thanks Aiden.” Lisa smiled, normally she was stressed by the kids and always looked panicked, but the quick flash of happiness that flew across her face made my heart light up.

We both sat down on opposite sides of the small waiting room to the daycare, and just talked. It was nice hearing about her vacation she’d had recently, and how her home renovation project she was doing herself was going well. She chose “eggshell white” for the bathroom. We were quickly interrupted, however.

Pastor Samuel burst into the room, a bit of an annoyed look on his face.

“Lisa, I know how hard you work every day, but I beg of you, please keep the children's crying to a minimum. There’s a woman who just lost her child in the church, and I don’t need this reminding her of her child every second.”

Pastor Samuel was older, probably fifty or sixty, but it wasn’t like his hearing was that bad. The kid, now sitting on a couch in the daycare, hadn’t been crying for ten or fifteen minutes. He just continually played Candy Crush, giggling whenever he won. Sort of cute, definitely the opposite of what he had just been doing.

“Sorry about that earlier, but we calmed him down a while ago.” Lisa replied awkwardly.

“I could hear the crying from in here just a second ago, same with the mother.” Pastor Samuel didn’t seem to budge on the idea of someone crying, he seemed slightly agitated.

Pastor Samuel was a kind man, he volunteered at different organizations every weekend, a food bank was even started in his name. It wasn’t like him to get so angry, however, when it came to any member of his congregation, he didn’t take any bull.

“Pastor Samuel, I promise you that there’s only one child in here, and he hasn’t cried once since... 10:10 PM.

“I checked the time exactly when the crying started, it was at 10:14 PM.” Pastor Samuel wasn’t going to let this go.

“Listen, I-” Lisa was interrupted by the sudden screaming and crying of someone.

Lisa groaned, got up from her chair, and walked into the nursery, but stopped.

I followed behind her and saw Charlie sitting on the couch with my phone in his hand perfectly content, yet the crying continued.

I turned back and faced Pastor Samuel; he seemed perplexed as well.

“Is he the only child inside the daycare?” he asked, looking into the daycare.

“Yeah, his parents were supposed to pick him up an hour ago, and noone else was registered all day.” Lisa replied, a bit anxious, holding her arm.

The crying got louder, and we turned to the door opposite to the bright, and cheery daycare, themed with rainbow. The door to the morgue was open just a hair, and the crying seemed to be coming from there. I walked out the daycare and to the small door with the words above it in bold, “MORGUE.”

I looked behind me, and there was Pastor Samuel looking over my shoulder at the door. Lisa was in the doorway to the daycare, holding Charlie’s hand, in his other hand my phone, he probably got bored of the same Candy Crush level I’d been stuck on since August.

Suddenly, the doors to the church burst open, and Ms. Cheng ran to Pastor Samuel, silently crying, not the source to whatever was wailing.

Ms. Cheng immigrated from China when she was seven, as I’ve been told an infinite number of times. Ms. Cheng was a regular at the café, ever since her son went into a coma after suffering a seizure at school. She sat at the end of his bed every Saturday since 2018, waiting for some sort of sign he might wake up. Her husband had died a while back, so he was all she really had. The staff of the hospital, doctors, nurses, even the janitorial staff knew her by heart, and we treated her like family. Literally. She brought dumplings to the staff's Christmas party last year. I knew something was wrong when she didn’t order her usual latte today, and I’d heard rumors from other doctors her son had died in the night. This confirmed those rumors.

“What... what is that wretched noise.” She said, sniffling and wiping her eyes as she did so, holding a bible in her right hand.

If five people standing next to the morgue wasn’t enough, Mr. Flores walked in with a pair of cheap knock off AirPods, quietly whistling to himself. He was mopping the floors and staring at the ground, but looked up once his eyeline met my shoes. He didn’t take out the airpods, and just gave a quick wave, before turning back and shutting the metal gate that divided the small hallway and the rest of the hospital. He locked the door and turned back behind him still seeing us, and finally took out one of the earbuds.

“Uh. What you doing here still?” He asked in broken English, confused to the number of people outside the morgue, until the sound of the crying hit his ears.

Mr. Flores had worked at the hospital longer than I had worked there. He’s the head janitor at the hospital, yet even in his position he still insists on cleaning the area’s most people don’t want to (mainly being the hallway I work in). He’s also in charge of locking up each night, which is probably what he was doing until the crying interrupted him. I don’t normally see him at night, because I’m usually long gone by the time he arrives.

As soon as he heard the crying, Mr. Flores got the message, and quickly looked at all of us. He looked concerned and took out a big ring of keys and walked in front of me. Nudging me aside, he opened the door to the morgue, and stepped inside. Surprisingly, next to enter was Ms. Cheng, the morbid curiosity of what the noise was must have gotten ahold of her. I walked in next, and Pastor Samuel followed quickly behind. Lisa stood in the doorway of the morgue still holding Charlie’s hand.

Ms. Cheng looked around for a second, all of us still in complete silence, and pointed at one of the small doors in the wall of freezers that kept the bodies cold.

“Is... noise coming from freezer?” Mr. Flores asked, yet we all knew the answer to that.

I looked around the room, and while the noise was concerning, I was surprised how no one even seemed to have noticed the body on the gurney in the middle of the room, covered by a thin grey sheet.

I turned back to the freezer, and now Pastor Samuel was directly in front of it, reaching a hand out, but stopped himself.

“This is wrong. This must be some sort of prank. We should not disturb the dead.” Pastor Samuel proclaimed, taking a few steps back from the freezer and accidentally stepping on a lab coat and shoe behind him, strewn across the floor.

The crying continued, but it seemed to get quieter, like it knew we could hear it, and decided to put less energy into the wailing. Mr. Flores shook his head.

“Sick prank, people are messed up in the head.” Mrs. Cheng crossed her arms, walking out of the morgue, essentially pushing Lisa aside, and Pastor Samuel power walked behind her.

Suddenly, Lisa yelled.

“Charlie!”

Charlie had suddenly run ahead, giggling, somehow gotten out of Lisa’s grip on his hand, and pushed Mr. Flores before stopping straight in front of the freezer and grabbing the handle to which the noise was coming out of.

“Charlie, stop!” I yelled, but we knew what was about to happen.

The little brat pulled the handle downward.

The door to the freezer sprung open, and the bed that slid in and out of the freezer’s “drawer” like system barreled out, hitting Charlie square in the forehead, causing him to fall over.

The crying coming from the freezer was quickly replaced with Charlie’s, and Lisa ran toward him, horrified by the very small injury the child has sustained.

“CHARLIE! Oh, my goodness, oh my goodness, are you alright? Where does it h-” Lisa stopped, looking down at the drawer that had come out of the freezer.

On top of the table was Mr. Andrews.

Mr. Andrews was a bright man, even though he was constantly put through depressing situations, he never let that keep him down. He always was smiling and bought a ham and cheese sandwich every single day from the café. He wasn’t a patient, however. He was the coroner.

Mr. Andrews had a scalpel in the left side of his chest, the torn flesh was able to be seen near the area of the wound, his face was frozen with a horrified look, and the tie and flannel shirt he wore every day was stained with blood. The glasses he wore had a crack in the right frame, and one of his shoes was missing. Mr. Andrews was supposed to be in the morgue, but he was not supposed to be dead. Judging by the looks of him, the death had been recent, but not recent enough to be the source of his crying.

“BANG!”

Suddenly, the door to the morgue closed shut, locking, leaving me with a daycare attendant, a janitor, and an injured brat with the body of a murdered man.
