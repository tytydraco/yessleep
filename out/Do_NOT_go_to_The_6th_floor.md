Title: Do NOT go to The 6th floor.

"Welcome to the Patterson's motel, on the 4th floor, there's 2 beds and 1 TV with a bathroom and a small kitchen. John Lee Carson age 46 killed himself with a gun and his girlfriend with an axe on this very bed."

I said into the recorder, my words echoed through the room like thunder, each syllable infused with a palpable intensity that held everyone's attention captive.

"They say the reason why he killed her is because he was doing a sacrifice, but what for?" My voice carried a weight of mysteriousness, as if i already held the answer within his grasp. 

"Stay tuned for the horrors that await in this hunting place," i announced, my voice tinged with theatricality. With a click, i ended the recording, shedding my facade and collapsing onto the bed, exhaustion weighing heavy on my weary frame.

**Unraveling the Enigma of the Grand Dolphin Hotel**

'The Grand Dolphin Hotel, a prominent fixture in New York City, has captivated the imaginations of locals and tourists alike for generations. Established by Steven Hanks on October 6, 1906, and opened to the public on December 6, 1966, this historic landmark holds more than just luxurious accommodationsâ€”it holds a dark secret.

The hotel's sixth floor has become infamous over the years, its history marred by a series of inexplicable tragedies. One such incident occurred in room 69, where Henry Morrison, a 34-year-old college professor, was discovered dead with a knife in hand. Despite investigators ruling it a suicide, speculation surrounding the circumstances of his demise persisted and he also was the only one on the 6th floor.

The sixth floor garnered further attention in 1934 when it was dubbed the "devil's floor" due to its association with the number six, reminiscent of the biblical 666. However, the true horror unfolded when 200 individuals staying on the sixth floor were tragically found dead the following day, all having taken their own lives. This shocking event led to the temporary closure of the hotel as authorities grappled with the inexplicable loss of life.

Upon reopening, the hotel took drastic measures to address the haunting rumors surrounding the sixth floor. It remained sealed off to guests, shrouded in mystery and speculation. While some dismiss the notion of a haunted hotel as mere superstition, others remain wary of the chilling warnings associated with the Grand Dolphin Hotel's sixth floor, till this day the Grand dolphin hotel remained open.'

"Sounds interesting, this will definitely boost my book sales," I remarked to myself, a sense of anticipation tingling within me.

"This room is definitely not haunted," I assured myself, casting a quick glance around the room to dispel any lingering doubts. With a sense of determination, I made the decision to retire for the night, knowing that big plans awaited me at the Grand Dolphin Hotel.
