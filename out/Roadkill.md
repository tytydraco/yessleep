Some people believe that only humans possess a soul. That we alone are the wisest and the highest beings, meaning we alone are better than anything else out there.
And others see the world in a bigger frame,
Knowing that all around us breathes and lives. They carry deep empathy - a quiet awareness for nature and the creatures
Within the world we are building around them.
                                 
                                        .  .  .  .  .

Ever since I was a kid I always felt out of place. Being forced to live with my grandparents when I was six, forced me to mature faster than the other kids around me. 
My grandparents always seemed annoyed with my childlike behavior towards things. Dismissing the “nonsense” I spoke, Scoffing at the hours I spent with toys, As if my imagination was a waste, Better traded for something “useful.” 
I had always hated how distant they were, how they avoided any real emotional connection with me. I felt like such a burden, constantly aware that my presence might be an inconvenience to whatever they where doing. I tryed to avoid asking questions, and knew to only watch my cartoons when they would go to bed.
Though my youth spent with them wasn’t the most enjoyable or memorable, I do have several memories of my time around there farm. Each afternoon, I’d hop off the school bus and make my way to the barn. Always looking forward to the quiet company of the creatures who never minded my presence. I enjoyed peacefully being able to be myself, not being scolded at for talking to loud, or for asking too stupid of a question. They never cared what I did, or what I said. 

Another memory I have on the barn, is the first time I learned about our finishing barn.
I was around twelve when my grandmother decided I was old enough to know about this part of the farm. She led me down a narrow path I had never noticed before behind the barn, Its dirt worn by countless footsteps mixed with a few pebbles that scrunched and cracked when walked over. At the end stood a weathered barn. Its rusted metal roof rattled ever so slightly through a breeze, mixing precariously with the sound of grunts and squeals.
A fence enclosed the back where pigs all milled about. There round bodies looked like pink and brown dots scattered behind the fence from a distance.
It was there I first learned the truth—
When I learned about our slaughter stock.

Over time, I found myself walking down that worn path every weekend, just before breakfast.
With a notebook, pencil case, and towel in hand, I’d sit just feet from the fence,
Watching the pigs—resting, eating, playing—
And unaware of there upcoming fate.
Most days, I sketched the young piglets nestled beside their mother,
Struck even at a young age by the image of life and death so near to eachother.

Some days I would sit outside till lunch, sharing whatever snacks I brought with the pigs before I had to leave. And Others, I would have to leave early before my grandfather arrived.

I think that experience I had as a child, the love of animals intertwined with the fascination of death, lead me to where I am now. Allowing me to ease the grief and sorrow of others. Showing them the beauty of death, to preserve a quiet connection between life and what lies beyond.

( Fourteen years later … )

My phone alarm blares again, casting a harsh glow across the dim room I’ve been hunched over in for hours. I silence it quickly, glaring at the screen—2:30.
I told myself I would be asleep hours ago. 

Maybe that Adderall wasn’t the best idea.

I quickly roll my chair over to the side drawer, fingers rummaging until they find a few more pins. Just a few more, and I’ll finally be done. Nearly my entire weekend has been swallowed by this piece for one of my neighbors, the hours blurring together in a haze of pins and needles with stubborn determination. I lean in, carefully pressing each final pin into place, double-checking that nothing feels loose or looks sloppy. 
She’d been very specific with her request for this piece, her cat in a perfect sitting posture, head tilted just slightly to the right, and his tail held high. 

Rolling back in my chair I take sight in the piece that consumed my whole weekend. A slow tired breath left me as I finally moved the piece off my work bench into a soft bed of tissue paper, folding each corner around it like a blanket. The box closed with a gentle thud, and I carried into my kitchen carefully placing it onto the countertop.
 
I slowly treded into my bedroom, sliding off my slippers letting them tumble somewhere into the clutter beneath my bed. The mattress sighs beneath me as I crawl under my blanket, pulling it up to my chin until I’m cocooned in its warmth. The room is quiet except for the faint hum of the ceiling fan, and for a moment I thought sleep would come easily. But it doesn’t.
 I lay in bed for a few moments staring into the dark, before accepting the fact I’m somehow wide awake. With an agitated sigh, I scoot up against my headboard, reaching over to unplug my laptop. The screen flares to life, momentarily blinding me, the harsh white light spilling across the walls and washing my whole room in its pale glow. 
I figured it would be best to check any socials I have, just to see if I’d picked up any new followers since this weekend or maybe even gotten a few personal requests. Recently, I’ve been trying to build more of a social media presence, mostly because my personal hobbies alone can’t pay the rent. Part-time, I sell tattoo designs and 
sketches; mostly to friends, though every now and then I’ll get random requests from people. Another hobby I do is taxidermy. These days, I sell my pieces online, usually of smaller animals like mice or rats. 
For some reason, people go crazy over tiny rodents dressed in personalized little outfits? 
I also do larger animals too, but mostly by request. Over the years, I’ve tried to get more traction for my pieces, attending events, setting up pop-up booths whenever I can—but the truth is, people aren’t always comfortable with taxidermy. They’ll admire my work for ages, take photos, even ask questions… but when it comes to buying, most just walk away. 

Playing around on my laptop, with the feeling of sleep slowly creeping up to me, I notice a new email notification slide into the corner of my screen. I click it without much thought, expecting spam mail, or a sale from a website i forgot i was subscribe to. Instead, it’s a business inquiry.
Not only was it strange to get one this late at night, It also wasn’t sent to my work email. In fact, it had landed in an account I rarely use, one I don’t even list anywhere online. This was my personal email only used for subscriptions or junk mail. 
My fingers hover over the trackpad, caught of gaurd by this. Slowly, I click on the email and begin to read.

Hello, 

I realize this might be an unusual request, but I was wondering if you ever have worked with reptiles? I have a pet turtle, and I’m interested in the possibility of having him preserved. I understand this isn’t a typical commission, but I thought I’d reach out anyway. I know a friend who recommended you through Instagram, and I was immediately impressed with your work. I work as a Wildlife Biologist, and I particularly appreciate when animals are preserved in a way that doesn’t humanize them. 

If interested, please get back with me. I will be attending the Wildlife and Habitat expo in Springfield this week, I hope to see your booth there!

Thank you,
Keith

It’s three o’clock now. My eyelids feel heavy, and every part of me is begging for sleep. I still feel a bit uneasy over how he got my personal email, although I didn’t know if it was just my lack of sleep making me more paranoid that I should be. Hesitantly I start typing a reply,

Thank you for reaching out and for your kind words about my work. I have occasionally worked with reptiles, and I’d be happy to discuss your request further. Could you provide a few more details about your turtle and what you’re hoping for in the finished piece?

And yes I was planning on attending the Expo next week. I would love to meet you there. Also, may I ask how you got ahold of this email? This is mostly used for my personal needs. If you would like I can offer you my work email, or you can find it linked on all my socials!

Thank you,

I gently close my laptop and set it carefully on the table beside me. Sliding back under the covers, I tug the blanket up around my shoulders, trying to ease the restless tension in my mind. My eyelids feel heavy, my thoughts still buzzing from that late-night email and the tiny spark of confusion from how that email was even obtained? 

Turning over to my side, I lay there for a few more moments until I eventually feel myself finally drifting into sleep.
