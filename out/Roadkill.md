It was getting hot in the Uk, no not 10˚, I’m talking 25-30˚. Driving home after yet another backbreaking shift at a job I was pressured into, my mind was simply on autopilot.



I’d driven these suburban roads countless times, with their only hazard being the speedbumps. At least the cool breeze through my buzzcut and burnt orange sunset was a positive. It was late at that point, somewhere around 9:00 as I rounded the final corner.



Hitting the start of that small hill my house resides on; there was a pigeon just doing its thing in the middle of the road. Nothing new, I thought as I begrudgingly slowed down to sub-20mph. The little shit barely avoided becoming an ornament on my bumper, as it shot out at the last possible second.



There was no sound, but the advent of feathers on the road behind me indicated the fowl didn’t get off scot-free.



Quickly flicking from my wing to rearview, it had landed on the pavement, now seemingly staring back at my car. Obliviously bouncing over the first speedbump, my focus was quickly trained back on the road ahead.



Though it seemed okay, I could tell it wasn’t normal. Something about its proportions, maybe one wing was smaller, or its leg was a little too thick. Regardless though those features didn’t stand out as important.



Understandably pissed off, that experience was quickly shoved into the useless memories department of my brain ready to be forgotten.



That would have been the case if it hadn’t escalated.

Same time, same road a couple of days later, again there was the pigeon dawdling at the start of my hills incline. Taking action once again, this time to the extent of an emergency stop, the dumb bird just flapped off to the side of the pavement, observing as I departed.



My increasingly rational mind thought up a scenario where the government was checking people’s willingness to stop in the event of an animal on the road, utilising their drone pigeons.



Though its basis was on as stable ground as the ocean, I did feel better abound not driving it into the tarmac, mechanical or not.



With those previous experiences fresh in my mind, my final journey home for the week was altered. Opting for a different route, in order to theorise weather that bird was in fact singling me out, I took a right, rather than a left.



Yes, the road works shutting off that lane was a deciding factor, though that small portion of my brain still wanted answers.



Funnily enough, he’d brought his friends this time. Five, I repeat five pigeons across the same stretch of road, only 1 kilometre long. Each incident, had them darting away as I slowly lost patience and refrained from even touching my break by the last one.



That final bird, being the one I’d seen all week. Lingering there in the centre of the road, its brainless almost mocking head cocks sought to infuriate me further.



Messaging my parents, didn’t give me any reprieve. My father barked that increasingly common line, “you’re not a child anymore Harrison, stop lying and ack like a man.”



Five days down, five birds still alive. Rucky numbers in most fps games and far from how my father would have delt with them.

That weekend was equally as warm, hitting heights of 32 degrees. My lazy ass slumped back in my desk chair, two fans on me and one on my pc. No driving = no birds, or so I thought.



Grabbing a drink and making my way back to my room, my gaze was grasped by a pigeon sitting on my balcony. The old Victorian house I resident at had small extensions, not fit to stand on, though surprisingly welcoming for the occasional bird.



Thinking nothing off it, I hopped back onto my chair, enjoying the incoming breeze from my open window.



That fact alone froze my previously clammy body, as I was petrified in place. I hate insects in my room, so I only ever crack my bedroom window open an inch or two. As my body thawed, allowing just my head to turn, that same uncanny bird peaked its twitching head under my uplifted glass pane, as a glazed over white eyes scanned me.



I’ll admit, I freaked, grabbing the metal flask to my side and using it like a ram, forcing the bird back and slamming the pane down. The bird twitched again, as I got a better look at its overall appearance.



Practically nothing about the ‘bird’ could be described as natural. That milky white eye was massive, far larger than should have been able to fit into the socket it bulged from. Similarly, its ‘feathers’ were nothing more than patches of matter fur, hair and the occasionally sparce quill.



Worse of all were its feet, if you can even call them that. Three small burnt blistering human fingers sprouted from the creature’s leg. Those soft, wet thuds as it crept from one side of the window to the other almost made me gag as I tried not look.



Its other appendage was a short, hairless pawlike structure, though significantly small, forcing the creature to waddle with a limp.



From a distance its colouration and makeup could have passed for a natural creature, but up close, the horrific facsimile was nothing more than a mishmash of organic parts.



Taking a step back and reaching for the toggle for my blind in an attempt to avert my eyes, it opened its cracked beak, letting out a raspy guttural squark.



Though my headphones were supposed to be noise cancelling, that creatures’ shrill caws still pierced my ears and just my luck, it was relentless. Somehow, I managed to get a couple hours sleep that night, though waking in the morning and peaking from behind the blind, it was still there, scratching out its incessant tune.

Thankful my parents were returning from their weeklong holiday; I was hoping that my farther would at least be able to shoo it off.



Getting chewed out again for ‘acting like a girl’, my father scoffed at my account as he entered the front door. Sighing and relenting, he strode up and into my room. Opening the window and coming face to face with the creature, he spoke.



Though it was faint, I could hear him mutter under his breath. “Pigeons, again.”



Peaking from behind, another bird had joined my roadkill-esque stalker.



Though not nearly as grotesque as its compatriot, the other pigeon was equally as misshapen, giving the silhouette of a living breathing creature, though adorned with a haphazard arrangement of miscellaneous parts of other fauna.



Bellowing back to me in his familiar demanding tone, my fathers voice cut through the duet of broken squawks.



“Make yourself useful and bring me something to smack them off with.”



His venomous order had me on my heels as I ventured across the hall and into his room. I knew far too well that he kept a bat behind his wardrobe and though my mother didn’t condone it, she was idle in his presence.



Moments before reaching out for the doorknob, a high-pitched wail emanated from the first floor as the squawks only grew louder, slowly contorting into what I can only describe as gleeful laughter, followed by a thud.



Though in my heart I think I knew what they’d done, orders were orders. Gripping the bat and slowly stepping back into my room, my father was gone, and so were the creatures.



Hesitantly stepping to the window, bat outstretched in my trembling hands. Peaking just over the eclipse of the chipped stone balcony, was a body, lying face down in the grass of my front garden.



A swath of creatures encircled, as they quietly crept closer. There had to be around four or five, with the larger creature easily identifiable. That bird limped over to the body, before hopping on to his upper back. The perimeter of malformed pigeons cued as the larger one pecked.



After only a few seconds of picking at the cadavers’ throat, it let out another unholy caw, this time resembling the broken scream of a person. Its call to devour elicited the gang of creatures to gorge themselves.



I couldn’t look down there, regardless of how he was. Soft ripping and snapping sounds followed as my mind crafted a disgusting vision, imprinted on my psyche.



Her screams quickly followed. Shouts of ‘get away’ or ‘leave him alone’ only momentarily paused their evisceration. What she hoped to gain from her hysteric please, I don’t know. Just stepping out there, however noble, had only sealed her fate.



Oh, she screamed, unlike my father she was definitely alive, at least for the start. That same clawing, ripping sound had me balled up with my hands over my ears, trying in vain to block out their frenzied swarm.



It wasn’t quick, at least he’d been silenced in one swift motion. The persistent pecking only seaced with a word. A name.



Turning slowly, that crude organism was plastered to the window. Its mattered covering now a mixture of skin, fur and feathers, though stretching out from the rounded numb of its wings were three bony appendages, mimicking fingers.



Flocked by its now quire of malformed raptors, it opened its snubbed beak, revealing a sparce spread of small human teeth and a long pink tongue.



Then it spoke again.



In a broken scratchy attempt at human speech, to my fractured mind, it really sounded like that creature said my name.



\---

  


In the days since, I’ve had a multitude of calls and texts about my absence, though killer birds isn’t a strong excuse. I even called the police, said something or someone was trying to break in, it wasn’t hard to make it sound believable, but she stopped me.



Only asking if I’d seen any strange birds.



Thinking these creatures were known and they’d be willing to assist, I blurted out what I’d seen and what had happened.



She let me rant, cry and sputter out the events of the last week, before saying sorry and hanging up.



Repeated calls all resulted in a deadline. Maybe those creatures tampered with the fuse, or I was just being confined to my fate.



It wasn’t like I could wait for anyone to just stumble over their bodies, looking down to the lawn below, nothing more than a small pool of stain grass remained in their wake. With me not having any other living family in the country, it wasn’t like I could coerce anyone to freely feed themselves to the swarm in hopes of rescue. 

Could I make a run for it? Undoubtably pointless.

Peeking out from behind my blind, they’d grown. Not just in size but in quantity. Every available branch, power line and spot on my balcony was covered in birds, all in varied stages of modification.

That things now forward-facing eyes gleamed back into mine with a twisted smile cracking as it contorted across that creature’s twisted face.

It must know I can’t stay here forever.

Those ever-present squawks repeat as more join the cacophony of calls, all scratching out my name.

That misplaced feeling of relief for not hitting what I deemed a poor defenceless animal, inverted. Its malicious ego intent to render me unappreciated, like carrion by the roadside.
