I watched Father resuscitate a dingo. It was late at night on the side of the road. Our ute’s twin spotties beamed light across Father as he knelt in the gravel, his lips wrapped over the dog’s muzzle, pumping breath into its nose. 

Aglow against the backdrop of dark sky, he looked like an actor on a stage, performing some bizarre one-man play. 

I was twelve years old.

Soundlessly, in the remote distance, wires of lightning struck the earth. Like photographs, each flash exposed the stark desert beyond.

Raising his reddening head, Father took a huge intake of air.

“It’s female,” he said breathlessly.

I stood beside the ute and watched.

“C’mon,” Father said to the limp dingo. He grabbed the animal in both hands and shook it hard, then blew into the dingo again and this time the dog’s feet twitched.

Ribs protruded from under patchy fur. Strings of drool hung from the corners of the dingo’s muzzle as it smoked breath into the cold air. Its wild eyes blinked.

Father rubbed its chest and spoke to it softly—words I couldn’t hear.

“Son,” he called to me. “Help me get her up.”

Together, we moved her to the ute’s tray. He pulled a length of thick chain, scraping it violently across the tray of the ute. The dog spun her head around.

Father hung the chain around her neck. I can’t say why—she was dazed and weak.

“Roadkill,” Father said, patting the dingo’s head.

I would have named her something less gruesome.

Once we were moving again, I watched her through the cabin’s rear window. We drove into the dark barren landscape to the loud rattle of Roadkill’s chains sloshing in the tray of the ute. Father leaned forward when he drove, always speeding.

“Take this,” he said, removing something from his shirt pocket.

He handed it to me, and it poked my skin. A misshapen ring. More like a metal thimble, specially machined so the elongated tip formed a sharp triangular blade, about an inch long. The blade hooked slightly inward.

“You’ll use that to train her,” Father said.

We tore into a dirt road that led downhill into a deep crevasse of exposed red granite until reaching our home—an abandoned mine.

“Roadkill is yours, son,” Father said as we slowed. The ute shook over jagged rocks. “She’s your project.”

I weighed the demented thimble in my hand, solid and heavy.

I looked over my shoulder at Roadkill. Jostled in the tray, she lay splayed, exhausted. The chain Father put around her neck scraped back and forth across the metal.

“Okay,” I said, sliding the thimble onto my thumb.

But I knew I’d never use the cruel device on Roadkill. Not ever.

Later that night, in his homemade laboratory, Father helped birth a new litter of bioluminescent mastiffs. For years he’d experimented with biohacking—injecting animals with DNA he edited himself using his own centrifuge, thermocyclers and transilluminators. Mail ordered equipment. Father’s goal was to create an enhanced breed of canine. Stronger. More muscular, more obedient, and with a longer lifespan than any in existence. And he wanted them to glow in the dark. A perfect guard dog.

The pregnant mastiff’s alien green eyes were stolid and unblinking as Father yanked a puppy out by the head. A web of blood vessels protruded from the skin of her distended stomach so severely I thought they might burst.

As Father delivered the pup, tongue lolling, the mother didn’t yelp or make anything resembling a dog noise. Instead, in a human-like way, she sucked pockets of air into her mouth as though the pain were so great she could hardly breathe.

Father held the puppy up by the scruff of its neck like bloodied sock. He wiped a film of mucous from its closed eyes, massaged its tiny, wrinkled body with his large, gloved hand, and coaxed it to breathe. The puppy squirmed. It was as though Father gave the creature life.

“The provenance of dogs is in experiments of man,” Father said. “An experiment we’ve conducted for thousands of years. Mastiffs obeyed Genghis Khan.”

He brought the puppy to my Mother’s den. I followed, eager to see my Mother. Father hadn’t let me into her den in two days and I’d been thinking about her all that time, and about the raspberries in my front right pants pocket, soaking through the fabric. They had globed into a wet mass.

Mother lay on the bed in the centre of a cathedral of exposed rock. Rows of lit candles encircled her bed, illuminating the reddish-brown walls.

I stepped behind Father as he approached the side of her bed.

He lowered the puppy onto Mother’s chest. Her head was propped on pillows. Plastic tubing curled from her nose and wrists. A catheter snaked from the lower half of her bandaged body to a network of bags hung on metal hangers next to her bed.

The humid air stung of iron.

Vacantly, Mother stared up into the shadowed cavernous ceiling. The little pup almost disappeared into the folds of her breasts, staining her bandages with mucous. Blindly, the pup squirmed and nosed her.

Mother gave no reaction.

I gripped the raspberries in my pocket. Father snapped off his latex gloves, untied and stripped off his soiled apron, and left the room.

In one movement, I lifted them to Mother’s mouth, cupping them over her lips. Eyes locked on the doorway to watch for Father, I held the berries, waiting for Mother to open her mouth.

She needed fruit. Something fresh. It had been four days since I could sneak anything in. I just needed a moment, before he returned to the den.

Pupils cornered in the bloodshot whites of her eyes; Mother’s gaze met mine. She shook her head.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

She eyeballed the door, then, with caution, her mouth opened and received the raspberries. I tilted them into her mouth, careful not to spill any.

A low growl cut the room. My body jolted.

In the doorway were two luminescent green eyes.

The eyes of the pup's hulking mastiff mother.

Without thinking, my hand unclenched and the entire fistful of raspberries tumbled into Mother’s mouth. The mastiff stepped towards me, growling and barking.

Mother choked and coughed up the raspberries. I scooped the saliva-soaked berries from her face and chin and neck, all while snatching looks at the advancing dog. But I couldn’t hide the evidence in time.

Mother coughed as Father entered the room.

He saw the mess on Mother’s face.

Without speaking, Father patted the mastiff, calming it, and came to the side of the bed. He stuck his fingers into Mother’s mouth and pried out raspberries and flung them.

Leaning her forward, he banged on Mother’s back with the flat of his hand until a raspberry popped out and Mother ceased her fit. He took the pup from Mother’s bed and placed it on the floor in front of the mastiff. The dog incessantly licked her pup.

Father looked at me and exhaled through his nose.

I swallowed. “I’m sorry,” I said.

“You know she’s on a strict diet, but you’ve been feeding her this.” He glanced down at the berries. “How many times?”

“Just this time,” I lied.

Father’s eyes narrowed at Mother.

“Is that true?” Father asked her.

I shouldn’t have lied. Mother hadn’t asked for food, ever. And now, I’d put her in danger. It was my fault.

Mother’s voice was weak and raspy. “I asked for them.”

“No, she didn’t!” I said. “It’s my fault.”

Father’s eyes widened at both of us. “You’re a pair of lying runts,” he growled. Focusing his piercing gaze on me, his hand gripped my shirt collar.

“I see where you inherited your rebellious streak.”

Crouching, he brought his face close to mine. His eyes studied me, like I was a mathematical equation to be solved. “Each disobedient act is an insult to me.”

His breath had a foul vinegar stench and his bushy unkept moustache dripped sweat. The last thing I remember is the back of his hand rushing into me.

\#

I woke to the smell of faeces. It made me cough and wrinkle my nose.

A shaft of moonlight spilled into the cave through an opening above.

When I moved my arm, I felt fur. It was Roadkill. We were curled up next to each other on a hard metal floor. Metal bars surrounded us.

We were in a cage.

Father had locked me up again.

Pain bloomed in my face. I rubbed my cheek, and it felt swollen.

Roadkill panted. The air was hot and damp. My eyes adjusted to the low light.

When I reached out to pet Roadkill’s head, she growled.

In a calm voice, I spoke to her. I told her I meant her no harm and wanted to be her friend. I told her Father would let us out and I’d take care of her and I’d never hurt her.

While saying these things, I placed my hand on her side, and she didn’t growl. She let me stroke her fur, and I kept talking to her.

“I plan to get Mother out of here,” I whispered. “Will you help me?”

Roadkill nuzzled my neck and leaned on me.

Together, we fell asleep.

\#

It was four years later when Mother got pregnant.

On my sixteenth birthday, Roadkill at my side, I stood in the doorway to Mother’s den and watched her huge stomach rise and fall to each laboured breath. Her skin was the colour of tallow, her lips cracked and bleeding.

She watched me with wet, pleading, eyes. Morning sunlight reflected off the moist cave walls, giving the air an ethereal golden shimmer.

While Father knelt at the foot of Mother’s bed like an entranced supplicant, I crept up next to the bed. Father’s eyes were closed, his hands holding the small family bible—the one always tucked in his shirt pocket—he muttered to himself words I couldn’t hear; his face serious—brow knitted.

Mother cupped my cheek in her hand and mouthed “I love you” and I mouthed the words back and grasped her pale hand. It felt so weak it could have been dead.

\#

Every birthday Father took me to Uncle Rosco’s to go hunting. It was a one-hour drive, deeper into the outback. Uncle Rosco’s bush shack came into view and Father downshifted. The engine growled. Roadkill paced uneasily in the ute’s tray, pressing her nose against the window to check on me.

I’d looked back at her most of the trip, thinking about escape.

Puzzling over how to get Mother out.

As our ute pulled up, the shack door opened and Uncle Rosco slowly emerged, wheeling his wheelchair onto the porch. A grin cut his face.

\#

When Father left to hunt on his own, I stayed with Uncle Rosco, and we played cards. He inspected his hand.

“God damn it. You want to swap?” Rosco said.

I shook my head.

“How’ve you been holding up?” Rosco asked.

Arranging the cards in my hand, I thought about Mother.

Roadkill rested her muzzle on my lap.

“I’m alive,” I said, scratching Roadkill on the head.

“I’m sorry about what your Mother did,” Rosco said. “Must be hard for you.”

I nodded. Around the time he began experimenting on her, my Father had lied to Rosco and said my Mother left us. Abandoned us for another man.

In a slow gesture, Rosco laid down a two of hearts.

I picked at the top of my cards.

“She never left,” I said.

My words hung between Uncle and me.

“My Mother never left,” I repeated.

Rosco looked me in the eye. Wrinkles on his bald head stretched and his scalp hardened solid.

My left foot twitched, tapping the floor. “Father keeps her locked up. Like a prisoner. He’s been experimenting on her. Biohacking.”

Uncle Rosco stared at me, unblinking.

For a long time, we said nothing. I shifted in my chair.

“He’s killing her,” I said.

Rosco laid his cards on the table and swallowed. He rubbed his jowls.

“There was always something … off … about him.” He checked out the window. “Before you were born, he lost his job at a laboratory. Never spoke about it—but he got sacked I reckon. Cause he could never get another job. Had a nervous breakdown and moved out here. You know, when we were kids, he always played too rough with the animals. Hurt them. To get some reaction. Your nanna hoped it was a phase, but … One time we found a dead cow in the field. Mutilated. Your dad swore it was dingoes. No dingo could do that, not what we saw. Poor thing had been flayed to ribbons. Its organs cut out.”

“I need your help,” I said.

Atop the table, Rosco twiddled his thumbs.

“She’s pregnant. She needs a doctor.”

Rosco cursed under his breath and shook his head. “I’m too old and fat, and...” He smacked the armrest of his wheelchair. “Hell, what can I do…”

“Will you call the police?” I tried.

He snapped his eyes onto me. “And get my own kid-brother jailed? Betray my family? You better take that back.”

I shook my head. “No, no, I’m just thinking. I’m big enough to move her now. If you tell me where a doctor is, I’ll get her there.”

The floorboards creaked as he wheeled himself back from the table to a credenza. On top was an old black telephone. Rosco grabbed it and yanked the cord, ripping it from the back. He turned to me, pointing.

“No one’s calling the cops. Understand? No one.”

“I understand.”

“We’re family. We’ll sort this out among ourselves.”

I nodded.

He pushed himself to the table and took a deep breath. “I’ll tell you what you do. When your Father’s busy out bush, you bring her here. Take the ute. I’ll be ready for you. We’ll load her into my truck, and I’ll get her to a hospital. Nearest one’s about a day’s drive. But ...”

My palms were sweating. A distant wind chime jangled in the breeze.

“You’ll have to stay here and answer to him. It won’t be pretty.”

I sighed with relief.

“I’ll have to answer to him too, when I get back. I don’t know what he’ll do.”

“I don’t care,” I said. “As long as Mother gets help.”

Rosco’s eyes shifted to the window. I followed his gaze. Framed in the blazing sunlit field of dirt and scrub, a dark figure in a wide brimmed hat approached. It was Father. A rabbit corpse swung from his hand. Flanked by dogs, rifle over his shoulder, he walked towards us—like a shadowed arbiter of death.

\#

Two weeks later, Father came to my room in the morning and told me he was going for a long hunt on foot with his mastiffs to set snare traps.

“I’ll be back late. Maybe even tomorrow morning.” He hung the ute keys in front of my face. “In case you need it.”

I went to grab them and snatched them back.

“One scratch and you’re mincemeat,” he said.

I nodded and he tossed them over. It would be enough time.

After Father had been gone a few hours, I got what I needed from the toolshed.

With a sledgehammer, I busted open the door to Mother’s den. Roadkill barked as we stepped in. Eyes half-closed, with hardly enough strength to move, Mother shook her head as I collected her into my arms and lowered her into the wheelbarrow.

“No,” she said. Barely a whisper. “Don’t. Your Father...”

“It’s okay, I’m taking you to a hospital,” I said.

Her eyes softened as though in sadness for me.

I unhooked the bags of fluid on the rack next to her bed and piled them in on top of her. Heaving the wheelbarrow out of the den, I pushed Mother to the ute and hoisted her into the tray.

Getting in after Roadkill, I fired up the engine. The loud roar lifted my confidence. My clothes were drenched in sweat. Wet palms on the steering wheel, I drove out of the abandoned mine, into the blistering sunlight of midday.

\#

It was an hour drive, speeding to Rosco’s shack. On approach the door opened, and he emerged in his wheelchair. I parked the ute out front.

“You made it,” he said, when I stepped out. Roadkill followed. Rosco wheeled himself to the rear of the ute. I opened the tray so he could see.

The large pregnant body of my Mother lay inside, covered in bandages and tubes and plastic bags of fluid. Eyes closed, she rolled onto her side.

Rosco stared at her, unmoving. He cursed and spat.

“That psychopath,” he said.

“Let’s get her into your truck. He’s out setting snare traps. We don’t have long.”

Rosco appraised me. “You look like hell. Let’s get you some water first. Her too. She’ll need it for the trip.”

“Alright,” I said, and leapt up onto the porch. “Let’s hurry.” I opened the door inward, Roadkill at my heels.

I paused, arrested by the sight before me. 

My body stiffened. I didn’t believe my eyes at first.

Behind me, Rosco cackled.

“I’m disappointed,” Father said. He sat at the card table wearing his broad stiff-brimmed hat and leather hunting jacket. Across the table lay his rifle. Carefully, he took a bullet from his jacket pocket and slotted it into the chamber.

“Got the mutt?” Father called. I turned and saw Uncle Rosco had leashed Roadkill and was holding him tight.

“Got her,” he called back.

A loud scrape of wood. Father’s chair crashed to the floor as he rushed me. With tremendous force, he shoved me out the door.

My leg swung back to stop from falling but I stumbled off the edge of the porch and tumbled ass over head onto the dry hard ground. Dust plumed around me.

Roadkill barked and lunged at Father, but Rosco held her back.

Standing on the porch, rifle crooked in his arm, Father stared down at me.

I got up and spat a wad of dirt.

Rosco laughed and coughed.

“You continue to defy me,” Father said. “This might be the only way you’ll learn.”

He aimed the barrel of the rifle at Roadkill.

“No!” I started towards him.

He aimed more carefully. “One more step—I pull the trigger.”

“Don’t,” I said, my voice cracked with panic. My hands went up in surrender. “Don’t kill my dog.”

“What would you prefer as punishment?” Father said, his eyes piercing me from behind the gunstock. “Go on, tell me, you filthy runt. How should I punish you instead? I’m curious. What have you got to bargain with?”

My heart raced. I looked at Roadkill. She leapt towards me and whimpered, but Uncle Rosco yanked her back to his side.

“I’ll fight you,” I said, and looked at Father.

The anger in his face transformed into smiling curiosity. “Fights are boring if there’s nothing at stake. Besides, I’d run you into the ground.”

I reached down and raised my pant leg. Strapped to my ankle was a hunting knife in a leather sheath. Father had given it to me years earlier. He’d trained me to use it.

Unsheathing the knife, I raised it in my hand.

“To the death,” I said.

Father grunted. Maybe in surprise. He looked at the flat bushland beyond, then up at the bright sky. “Maybe today is the day you die.”

He placed the rifle down and leaned it against the door jamb. From under his pant leg, he took out his own hunting knife. “The dingo means that much to you?” He strode down the porch steps, eyes locked on me.

I retreated—the knife held in my outstretched hand.

Father strode into the open field and crouched forward; his deep-set, flinty eyes, levelled at me under the brim of his hat. It was as if they peered at me from hell, tracking my every movement.

 About ten feet apart, we circled each other.

I mimicked his stance, lowering my shoulders, bending my knees. Crouching, I was still taller than him. Father was a short, lean wisp of a man. His corded muscles taught and thin. 

“I’m almost proud. Didn’t think you’d have the guts for something like this. Especially not for some mangey dingo,”

He lowered closer to the ground and made a swiping advance. I shuffled back, but not in time. The knife sliced my leg open above the left knee.

Rosco cackled in the background.

Limping back, I kept my eyes on Father. He stepped around me in a tightening circle, like an animal pacing a cage.

“I wonder if you’re ready to die. Or if, at this moment, regret is seeping into that slow useless brain of yours,” he said.

I swung my knife at him, once, then twice, slashing the air.

He dashed back and side-stepped.

“How long do you think I’ve been planning this?” he said, face stolid. “Take a guess.”

“Shut up.” My arm swung in a wide arc, and mid-swing I shifted my weight to plunge the knife at his crouched legs. He lunged to the side, but not quick enough. My knife sliced his thigh. A superficial cut.

“Damn,” he said, grinning. “Lucky boy.”

Barely pausing, he strafed. I turned my body and attempted to block. He was too low. Sprinting past, he ran his blade across my waist.

I retreated, the hand holding my knife, shaking.

Blood poured down my stomach. It was warm against my skin. I limped away from Father, holding my side with one hand. The blood seeped between my fingers.

Roadkill barked.

“Years,” Father said. “I’ve been planning this for years, son.”

Shuffling back to gain more distance, warm blood trickle into my boots. My eyesight dulled. Flies buzzed in my face.

Father bolted at me and slashed. I tried to parry his attack, but the side of my forearm got split open. Pain enflamed my arm.

I dropped to the ground and rolled away.

Flailing, I stumbled back to my feet and re-oriented.

Dust rose with a strong gust. It blurred my vision. My knife was gone. I wiped my eyes to clear the dust but smeared blood across my face instead. Squinting, I turned and saw Father pacing in the distance. Like some predatory apparition, his figure wound through clouds of sunlit dust.

He didn’t know I’d dropped my knife. Glancing down, I searched for it.

“It was a test,” Father said. “I didn’t intend to kill you for failing. But I see now you’re too broken to fix.”

My knife was gone. Blood squelched inside my boots.

“Fuck you,” I said, batting flies from my face.

All I could taste was irony blood.

From the dust, Father emerged and caught sight of my hands.

“Lose your knife, did you?” he said. “You don’t look too good, son.”

I limped, circling him, shuffling my way closer to Uncle’s shack.

“Plan on grabbing that rifle?” Father said, nodding to it with a grin. “Go on. See if you can get it.”

Crouched, I stepped back toward the porch. Father leapt forward and swiped at me.

I paused, unmoving.

Enclosing me, he jammed his knife into my side.

My abdomen exploded with pain.

Father’s eyes were chest height. I grabbed his head with both hands. On my thumb was the demented spiked thimble of metal he’d given me years earlier. The training tool he’d made me wear every day, even though I refused to use it on Roadkill.

In a blood-drunk rage of adrenaline, I sunk the sharp triangular tip into Father’s eye, pushing my thumb in as far as it would go.

Father screamed. Dropping his knife, he clasped his face with both hands, and collapsed onto his back, wailing in agony. Blood gushed from his eye socket.

Collecting his knife from the ground, I kneeled on top of his chest and sliced open his throat, drawing a red line with the edge of the blade.

Blood foamed from the cut.

All noise ceased. Father’s body lay in the dirt, motionless. He was dead. Thank Christ, he was dead.

Hand covering the wound in my side, I looked up to see Uncle Rosco, sitting in stunned silence. Roadkill escaped his grip and ran to me. She licked the cut above my knee.

Uncle Rosco and I exchanged glances. The look on his face was one of sheer terror. Then he turned to the rifle propped against the door jamb.

The gun was almost within arm’s length of him. About fifteen feet away from me.

I began to sprint, but my wounds flared, and my vision blurred again.

Uncle started pushing his wheelchair.

A white flash of pain filled my body, doubled me over—and I fell. I thought I might blackout and die, but instead managed to raise my head from the ground and see Uncle Rosco pick up the rifle.

“Sick him!” I yelled to Roadkill, pointing. “Get him, girl!”

Snapping alert, Roadkill ran at Uncle, growling.

Struggling with the rifle from the seat of his wheelchair, Uncle Rosco lifted it to aim, but seeing Roadkill, he panicked and fired.

The loud crack split the sky open. I squinted and my head felt as if filled with blood.

Roadkill pounced onto Uncle Rosco and throttled him. He screamed and the rifle clattered to the floor as he fought to get the dog off.

Was I hit? No. He’d missed. Crawling, I heaved myself to the porch.

Arms pulling my body up the steps, I lifted my legs and forced myself onto my feet. Grasping air, I staggered and fell onto the rifle, hugging it as I went down, flipping onto my back. Slippery in my bloody hands, I pointed it at Uncle.

“Roadkill, stop! Stop it girl!” I shouted. To my command, Roadkill ceased chewing my Uncle’s neck and came to me.

Using the rifle as a crutch, I levered myself off the floor and found my balance.

Uncle Rosco whimpered; his wet eyes filled with a mixture of fear and hatred. His hand held the gash in his neck that leaked blood down his chest. He snorted and choked, and tears streamed down his face.

“Got a first aid kit?” I asked. “And a map?”

 \#

Under the bathroom sink I found a first aid kit and dressed my wounds best I could. The cut across my stomach hadn’t been deep enough to tear muscle. The hole in my side was the worst, but nothing vital got hit. Uncle Rosco had locked himself in a closet to sob and whimper, and that’s where I left him.

“Mum,” I said, climbing into the ute’s tray, my voice hoarse.

Laying in the ute, her large pale body was naked, save for yellowed bandages around her chest and stomach. She was awake now, eyes wide.

“You okay? Let’s get you to hospital,” I said, holding a bottle of water to her mouth. Roadkill barked in agreement, bouncing her front paws up onto the tray.

Mother held her bulbous stomach and grabbed me by the arm, ignoring the bottle. She put my hand on her belly.

I felt a kick.

“Look,” Mother said. She peeled the bandages down her stomach. Her bare belly was like an enormous semi-translucent egg, corded with veins. I leaned over and saw something move beneath the skin.

Two glowing green eyes.
