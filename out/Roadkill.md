 

I strained to force open my crust coated eyelids as rays of sunlight beamed full force into my face. My head pounded, pleading with me to shut the blinds. I nearly gagged as the stench of my own rancid breath wafted out of my dry sticky mouth and collided with my nostrils.

I lazily glanced over at the alarm clock. Twelve minutes past one. I rolled over and shut my eyes, attempting in vain to quell the thunderstorm raging in my head.

Suddenly my stomach lurched and I shot out of bed, darting down the hall to the bathroom. I’d barely lifted the toilet seat when scalding hot vomit flowed from my mouth like burning magma. Yep, there was no doubt about it. I’d blacked out again.

I spat the last remaining chunks of puke into the bowl. I pulled the handle and as I watched the remains of last night’s liquid dinner swirl down the drain, I tried to recall even a sliver of my wild misadventure. I couldn’t remember a thing after I took my seat at the bar in Slim Jimmy’s.

I’d become a regular at Slim’s after I’d caught my girlfriend of three years cheating on me with my childhood best friend. The bar had become a sort of safe haven for me, somewhere I could go to share a laugh with fellow patrons and drown my sorrows. But what no one tells you is, no matter how many shots you throw back, no matter how many beers you kill, your sorrows have a nasty habit of bubbling back up to the surface. 

I brushed my teeth, purging the foul taste from my mouth. By the time I stepped out of the shower my hangover was beginning to subside a bit. I still felt completely sapped of energy and my stomach hadn’t entirely settled, but the hammering in my head had devolved into a minor headache. 

I haphazardly tossed my clothes into my room and slunk into the kitchen. After chugging a couple glasses of water, I poured myself a bowl of Fantastic Flakes; an obvious Frosted Flakes rip off (I make minimum wage, don’t judge).

I turned to the medicine cabinet and began rifling through it in search of Tylenol or Advil. I slammed the cabinet so hard that it nearly flew off its hinges when I realized that I’d depleted my supply a couple days prior following yet another long night at Slim’s.

“Hey hey hey, what’s going on in here?” a concerned voice called, followed by a head peeking from behind the door frame.

“Sorry Zach everything’s fine, I just ran out of painkillers and this hangover is wreaking havoc on me,” I admitted wearily. 

“I think I might have some in my room. Let me go check,” he chimed as he disappeared back around the corner.

Zach and I had been roommates since college. We’d bonded over how excruciatingly boring our shared calculus class was and we’d stuck together ever since. We’d grown especially close after my relationship abruptly ended and sometimes he’d accompany me on my drunken escapades. Did Zach go with me to the bar last night? I couldn’t remember. 

“You’re in luck. Found some Tylenol on my nightstand,” he grinned as he re-emerged into the kitchen, extending his palm triumphantly. 

“Dude you’re a lifesaver. I owe you one.” I grabbed the pills from his hand and greedily tossed them back, chasing them with another glass of water. 

I joined Zach on the couch, my third bowl of cereal nearly gone. He’d been watching the local news. I plopped down next to him as a petite blond news anchor began her segment; 

*Police say the body of Lauren Beckett was found in the middle of the road in the early morning hours on Peachtree Avenue. A medical examiner determined that Lauren, twenty-six, was killed on impact in a likely hit and run. Police urge anyone with information to call crime stoppers at 888-CASH.* 

“Man it takes a real fucked up person to hit someone with their car and just drive off like that,” Zach muttered, shaking his head. 

“Yeah must’ve been a true monster,” I agreed solemnly. 

“Soooo, long night again?” Zach prodded. 

“Yeah you know, the usual. You didn’t happen to go with me did you? I can’t remember shit.” 

I was eager to know if he'd accompanied me in case he could shed some light on anything that might’ve gone down last night. 

“Nope. Did have to repark your car this morning though. You gotta stop parking in the front lawn man,” he chuckled. 

My eyes grew wide as saucers and I broke out into a nervous sweat. 

“I-I didn’t. Tell me I fucking didn’t,” I stuttered, staring at him in shock. 

“Ha! You should see the look on your face!” he taunted as a wave of relief washed over me. “But seriously though, I think you ran over some roadkill or something. Looks like you might’ve dented your front bumper.” 

His shit-eating grin melted back to his normal chill demeanor and I knew instantly that he was being serious this time.

Dented was an understatement. My jaw hung open as I gawked in disbelief at the mangled front end of my car. 

“I must’ve hit a deer,” I thought as my mind struggled to process the message my eyes were relaying. My bumper was hanging on by a thread and blood spatter caked the grill of my 2020 Ford Fusion. 

“FUCK!” I screamed, pacing back and forth, a cocktail of emotions coursing through me. I’d just paid off my car note the previous month and I’d already managed to wreck the damned thing. 

Out of nowhere, a bout of rage enveloped me and I began furiously kicking my vehicle as if it were to blame for the state I found it in. On what must have been my six-hundredth blow, a glint within the grill caught my eye. 

I curiously bent down to investigate. The foreign object was lodged too deep to be able to discern what it was. After a few frustrating attempts to reach it, I retrieved a long screwdriver from the garage. 

I jabbed at the thing before it finally came loose, dropping to the ground with a soft plop. I blindly swept my hand beneath the car until it came into contact with something solid. I pulled the elusive item into view. 

I immediately dropped it back to the ground. 

All the color drained from my face. My head started to spin and my vision grew hazy. Hot bile crept up my throat and a torrent of undigested corn flakes flew across the driveway, unable to be forced down any longer. 

The object trapped in my grill was a human finger. 

I made a beeline for my room in a zombie-like trance. I couldn’t even begin to process what I had just seen. 

“Hey man, is everything okay? You look kinda pale,” Zach asked quizzically. 

“Yeah fine,” I mumbled as I threw the door shut to my room. 

I climbed into bed and hugged my knees to my chest, rocking back and forth. The scene around me blurred as tears threatened to overflow from my eyes. I was sweating bullets as a million thoughts raced through my head simultaneously.  I couldn’t have killed someone. I wasn’t a murderer. Surely if I had hit someone last night I would’ve remembered, or at least tried to help them. 

Right? 

I was still lost in my horrified stupor when I perceived a knocking at the front door followed by muffled voices. I was too petrified to eavesdrop, but a couple agonizing seconds later I had my answer to the identity of our visitors. 

A rapid pounding on my bedroom door startled me out of my trance. 

“POLICE PUT YOUR HANDS UP!” 

I hurriedly obeyed as cops flooded into my room, guns drawn. A tall beefy officer with muscles bigger than my head lifted me up and forcefully slammed me against the wall. He handcuffed me while a scrawny policeman with glasses read me my rights. It was all too much. Everything started to go dark around the edges. I blacked out.

I opened my eyes. I was in the back of a police cruiser. Panic overtook me and I began to hyperventilate. Then Zach trotted up to the car. He lightly rapped on the passenger window. Muscles slowly rolled it down. 

“What do you want?” he barked. 

“Can I talk to him? It’ll only take a minute.” 

The officer reluctantly agreed. 

“Make it quick,” he growled impatiently. 

“Zach, help me! You have to get me out of here! You know I’m innocent right?” I blurted, slinging words a mile a minute. 

“Dude I know it looks bad, but just calm down. I’ll help you however I can.” 

His words brought with them a tiny sliver of fleeting tranquility. 

“Oh and Mason, thank you,” he murmured, almost imperceptibly. 

I was utterly confused. 

“Thank me for what?” I asked, perplexed. 

His stern countenance twisted to form a wide manic grin. 

He leaned in mere inches from my ear and whispered, “for letting me borrow your car last night.”
