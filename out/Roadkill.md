Let me explain before you think I'm weird. I’ve always been a food enthusiast. Growing up, my father was a great cook, and I was lucky enough to experience a variety of traditional dishes, especially his delicious curries and spicy meals. For a long time, these flavors brought me joy. But as I grew older, my palate started to crave something new—something exciting that would thrill my taste buds like never before.

I tried everything: gourmet restaurants, trendy food trucks, and even fast-food chains that promised mouthwatering delights. I spent a small fortune in my quest for the next great meal, but nothing seemed to hit the spot. Each dish felt like a rehash of something I’d tasted before, lacking originality and the spark that once thrilled me. I began to feel disillusioned with food. The endless search for something different left me with a growing sense of dissatisfaction.

One day, while hanging out with my friend Daryl, he casually mentioned a cookbook he’d come across. I couldn’t believe my ears when he said it was all about cooking roadkill. At first, I thought he was joking. Who in their right mind would even consider such a thing? But as he read the description at the back of the book, I found myself intrigued. There was a certain thrill in the absurdity of it all. Here was a way to explore uncharted culinary territory, a chance to create something entirely new from ingredients that most people would simply overlook.

Daryl wasn’t going to use the cookbook himself; he had no intention of following through with it, and he hadn't read it either. He didn’t have the time or attention span for such an endeavor, so he handed the book over to me. I hesitated, but my curiosity gnawed at me until I accepted it. As I flipped through the pages, I was struck by the author’s passionate writing style and the detailed instructions. The recipes were oddly enticing, and I felt a strange thrill at the thought of trying it myself.

Days went by, and I kept mulling it over, my mind racing with possibilities. Could I really do this? It seemed grotesque, but also oddly exciting. Culinary innovation often requires stepping outside the box, right?

So, on a rainy afternoon, my heart pounding with a mix of excitement and apprehension, I set out on my quest. I drove along quiet country roads, scanning my surroundings for a fresh kill. What kind of person was I becoming? But when I found what I was looking for, I felt a rush of adrenaline. This was it.

I brought it home, cleaned it meticulously, and followed the cookbook's instructions to the letter. The process was strange, yet oddly satisfying. As I cooked, the aromas filled my kitchen, and I marveled at how something so seemingly grotesque could transform into a mouthwatering dish. I was amazed at how the flavors began to meld and deepen as the meal came together.

Finally, it was time to taste my creation. I plated the dish carefully, trying to ignore the nagging doubts in the back of my mind. As I took my first bite, I was taken aback. It was absolutely delicious—rich, savory, and unlike anything I had ever experienced. I couldn’t believe it; I had stumbled onto something remarkable. This cookbook had unlocked a whole new culinary world for me.

I couldn’t wait to experiment more, to dive deeper into this bizarre culinary adventure. I was ready to explore new flavors and push the boundaries of my cooking.

Still don’t know what to do with the guy's bike though...
