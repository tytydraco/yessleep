Before I was even 18 years old, I already knew how ridiculous this business was.  I knew because my dad used to take me to work with him even though he wasn't supposed to.  Every single day he used to hide me in the back of his car.  Frankly however, It was not that intense as I imagined it to be.

 The first time he took me was back in 2020, during the height of covid and quarantine; although he started working at this particular site back in 2019.  I won't say where this was but, it was a big property divided among multiple security guards.  My dad's section was entirely made up of offices with a dirt lot next to us since it was the edge of the entire property.

And man, this site was so dramtic and ridiculous.  If you had to categorize this site as a genre, I could call this: Drama, romance, crime, mystery, sci-fi (we even saw ufos), paranormal, etc, fucking etc.

Crime

When my dad started to take me, he told me stories about one of his co-workers when he first started working there; let's call him Vane.  The things he would do.

My dad said, "One of the office people called the property manager saying that his door lock was changed and that he had to break the door down to work.  The property manager then called my boss.  We would later find out that Vane changed the locks and store his guns and ammo and would just every night after his shift take them back with him."

"Didn't your boss say anything to the property manager?" I asked.

"No." He said so boldly.

"Why not?!"

"Cuz he's also shady."

My dad would go on further on how annoying he was.  He would ultimately complain to his boss (let's call him Isaac) and ask him to never have Vane as a co-worker ever again.

"My boss, after all the shady shit he would find out about this guy Vane, would still not fire him.  But finally just moved him to another site.  I later found out he got caught doing the same shit again.  I would not be surprised if Isaac still hasn't fired him."

Paranormal

"One time, I was partroling.  In the middle of it, I saw in the middle of the parking lot, something horizontal.  There was no light or anything all I could see was a silhouette of something.  It kind of looked like a pole.  As I got closer, to see what it was, and closer, suddenly as if it sensed me turned to face me.  It scared the shit out of me but somehow I didn't make a noise besides stepping back a little.  It was a man, but, the way he looked, it would be understandable if he was homeless but, his clothes looked normal.  Not only that, his smell was...demonic.  It was literally demonic.  I set aside his description and then just told him you can't be here.  He said nothing, but I just walked away hoping when I get back he'd be gone.  I was a little distance away from where I was, and suddenly I hear sprinting and stomping coming towards me I turn around and pull out my pepper spray but he just stopped and stares at me.  'Better get the fuck on!' I said, while making sure he sees me shake the pepper spray.  I walked away again but this time facing him, and nothing happened afterwards, I came back, and he was gone."

Ufos

Everyday, after everyone was gone, my dad would freely let me out of the car.  Not to just fuck around or anything, merely to stretch and just stand while still making sure no one sees me just in case.  We were talking in the middle of the night when I suddenly look up, and see a blinking light.  I know what this sounds like, a blinking light would mean a plane.  But no, because it was low enough for us to be able to hear sounds of a plane, but it made no sound.  It was low enough that we were able to make out its shape.  Believe us when we say, it straight up looked like that space ship from the movie "Aliens 2".  I pulled out my phone, right after I did, it turns.  The sky was clear, but in the middle of it was this lonely small cloud, where this ship or whatever started flying towards it.  As soon as it went either behind it or inside it, whatever the case, we never saw it again.

Conclusion

These stories don't directly relate to how this industry works, but they taught me the amount of possiblities in it and how it is.  There were times when my dad was arguing with his co-workers, for example, and I would just be ducking in the back seat, listening to the stupidity of his co-workers' arguements, and the utter shadiness of his bosses (not all of them just a couple), all together just seem like a kind if industry you should not be in, because being a security guard, requires nothing.  Literally nothing.  Isaac was straight up Patrick Bateman, just less psychotic, more like thuggish, at least I hoped so.  Again, I can't say where this took place but, it was somewhere in California.  My dad most likely wouldn't approve of me talking about this but, oh well.  I learned this, being a security guard should be one of those last resort jobs.
