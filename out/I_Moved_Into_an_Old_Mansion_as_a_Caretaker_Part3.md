[Part2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lxzomg/i_moved_into_an_old_mansion_as_a_caretaker_part2/)

When I stirred awake, my neck stiff and aching, the light in the room had turned a pale gold. The clock on the wall read 6:02 PM, and the sun’s final rays were barely holding on to the horizon.

But the bed beside me was empty.

Justine’s crib stood still and silent. The covers on the bed were rumpled, abandoned. Cathy was gone. So was George.

I shot up, knocking the chair over. *“Cathy?”* I called, voice cracking. “*George*?”

No answer.

I ran to the adjacent rooms, flinging open doors—nothing. Bathroom: empty. Kitchen: undisturbed. I checked the hallway, the back porch, even the laundry room.

Silence.

The packed bags were still there by the door, exactly where we had left them. Unmoved. Untouched.

This can’t be happening.

I pinched the inside of my forearm hard—so hard I felt the skin break. Blood welled up in a tiny crimson bead.

I was awake.

I rushed outside, scanning the garden, my eyes darting toward the swings—but they hung lifeless. I ran to the meadow, somehow hoping to find my family resting there. No luck.

I even circled back to the grave at the edge of the property, but they were no where.

Dread settled deep in my chest.

By the time I stumbled back to the front porch, the sun was gone. Night had fallen. Shadows pressed against the windows.

There was only one place left. I had been avoiding it all this time—but now, I couldn’t.

I grabbed a crowbar from tool shed outside and stepped back into the house when the old radio in the hall hissed to life with a crackle.

 *“Someone seems to be in a tearing hurry*,” a deep voice crackled through the speaker, slow and mocking.

“*Planning to break down doors now are you, Tom? You really think that’s going to get you the outcome you want?”*

But I didn’t stop. I stormed upstairs and swung the crowbar with everything I had. Blow after blow, I attacked the door until my arms screamed in protest. But it was useless. The wood didn’t even splinter—it was like striking solid metal.

And then, the radio hissed back to life.

Only this time, it was George’s voice.

***“****Mom, where do you think Dad is? I don’t feel so good... When can we get out of here? Are we going to die?”*

Cathy’s voice followed—worried, but doing her best to stay strong.

*“Don’t worry, sweetheart. Everything’s going to be okay. Your dad will find us. He will get us out of here,*” she said gently.

The radio cut to silence. I stood motionless, a tear rolling down my cheek.

I let the crowbar fall from my hand, its , then slowly descended the stairs and sat at the base, hollow and numb.

 *“What do you want from me?*” I asked at last, eyes still fixed on the floor.

*“I want your time, Tom. All five years of it. Just like it says in your contract,*” the voice replied.

“*So, there’s no replacement coming today at 7, is there?”* I asked, the words dry in my mouth.

*“I’m afraid not, Tom,*” the voice answered—almost sounding sympathetic.

“*Who are you*?” I asked, finally turning to face the voice.

“*I am Mr. Whitaker. The caretaker of this mansion.*”

My mind flicked to the photograph. “*Were you the man seated with the children in that old picture George came across?”*

“*I’m afraid not,*” the voice replied. “*That was the warden. He ran the orphanage that once operated here, many years ago. From what I’ve heard, he wasn’t a kind man.*”

The voice crackled, then continued.

*“Stories still linger about how he treated the children—strict isolation, enforced silence, days without food.”*

*“Discipline, he believed, was best maintained through fear. And when that failed, the cane did the talking. Which, by all accounts, was nearly every day.”*

*“Things got so bad that one day - somebody messed with his favorite radio, and it would no longer work.’*

*“Bereft of any auditory comfort, the warden, in an effort to nab the culprit, unleashed a wave of torment on the children that lasted for weeks—so depraved it changed them permanently.”*

*“From that point on, the warden was a marked man and it was only a matter of time before his end came.”*

*“It started with a bowl of soup laced with rat poison. As the warden rocked back and forth in his chair, clutching at his throat and foaming at the mouth, a dozen or more children came at him from all sides like feral dogs, ripping into him with whatever they could find – cleavers, forks, skewers, even rolling pins.”*

*“The ensuing carnage was so graphic that it led the remaining staff members to flee, never to return —leaving the children in charge of the mansion and their own destiny.”*

*“However expecting a group of children to administrate and delegate responsibility was easier said than done. With no common enemy to confront, they soon began to turn on each other. One chaotic night, a gas leak went unnoticed during a brawl, and a section of the building erupted in flames—claiming the lives of everyone left inside.”*

*“Since then, their spirits have never left, Tom. They still roam these grounds,” the voice finished, dissolving into static once again.* 

A long silence settled over the hall before I finally spoke.

*“As unfortunate as this is, what does any of this have to do with me, Mr Whitaker? “And if you are already the caretaker, then why bring me here to do the same job?”* I asked, my patience wearing thin.

*“I can’t fulfill the role in full, Tom,*” he replied. “*I exist only as a bridge between this world and the other. But I need someone living— of flesh and blood—to carry out what must be done here.”*

*“Which is what, exactly?*” I snapped, trying to keep my anger in check.

*“To help them find their freedom, Tom,*” Mr. Whitaker replied after a pause, his tone calm and matter-of-fact.

I stumbled back a step, as if the weight of his words had physically struck me.

“*No… no, this wasn’t the deal,*” I muttered, shaking my head as I began pacing at the foot of the stairs.

*“This isn’t what I signed up for. I was told caretaker duties—maintenance, oversight… not this*,” I said, my hands running through my hair, fingers tugging at the roots.

*“You can’t just spring this on me! You can’t expect me to deal with angry ghosts and trapped souls just by waving a contract in my face!”*

I stopped mid step, eyes darting, as if the walls themselves were listening.

*“But do you know what truly scares me more than even the ghosts, Mr. Whitaker?*” I asked, my voice barely steady.

*“It’s that I don’t even know what’s happening anymore. I don’t know if I’m awake or dreaming. I don’t know if any of this is real or just some kind of nightmare I haven’t woken up from. I can’t distinguish between the past and present—it’s like they’re all running in parallel.”*

I whipped around to the radio, eyes wild.

“*What the hell is this place?”*

There was a long pause in the hall almost as if Mr Whitaker was carefully choosing his response.

The radio crackled back to life a few moments later, his voice cutting through the uncomfortable silence.

*“Think of it like reading a book, Tom. When you read, the words leave an imprint on your mind, creating a sort of duplicate—a memory. You internalize it, interpret it, and process it. Depending on its impact and your own conditioning based on your personal life experiences, it might inspire action. It might even shape your perception of the past, present, or future. Or it might do none of those things and simply remain... a memory.”*

*“But tell me, Tom—just because you’ve created a copy of that book in your mind, does the real, physical book cease to exist? Of course not. Both versions exist—side by side.”*

*“With time, you’ll learn to navigate this place—and fulfil the task expected of you.”*

*“But the more important thing for you to understand is that there are rules here. As the caretaker, you’re assigned to help only one child earn her freedom. That child is Charlotte.”*

*“Do you see any other beings hovering in the hallways of this mansion? No, right? That’s because if there’s one thing everyone here has learned—it’s to wait their turn. That makes your job much easier.”*

*“The sooner you help her… the sooner you can leave.”*

Mr. Whitaker’s voice trailed off into static once more.

*“I just stood there motionless feeling completely lost. But I knew I was trapped and it was looking increasingly difficult to talk my way out of this.”*

*“What happens to my family?”* I finally asked.

*“They’ll be fine, Tom... as long as you hold up your end of the bargain,*” Mr. Whitaker replied.

“*And what if I refuse*?” I dared, finding myself staring at the old radio set.

There was complete pin drop silence in the hall, while I could feel a bead of sweat roll down my forehead.

And then the large knob of the radio set started turning clock wise automatically, as the radio burst into a wave of static again.

The radio flared to life again, but this time, it was George’s voice—sharp and alarmed.

“*Mom… Mom, what’s that behind you?”*

A pause. Static. Then a sudden, scraping distortion surged through the speaker—followed by Cathy’s gasp.

*“Stay behind me, George. Justine,”*

And then chaos.

Their screams tore through the hall—wild, frantic, as if something immense and monstrous was closing in on them. George shrieked, his terror raw and unfiltered, while Cathy’s cries twisted into panicked commands and broken sobs. Little Justine began wailing in the background, her sobs cutting through it all like needles.

I dropped to my knees.

*“No! Please!*” I cried, hands clenched in my hair. “*Stop this—please!*”

And then… silence.

The knob on the radio, which had been turning steadily on its own, clicked to a halt.

Everything stilled.

A moment later, Mr. Whitaker’s voice returned, calm and low:

“*Rise, Tom.”*

I hesitated, still shaking, but slowly got to my feet.

*“I want you to say it—in your own words. That you’re ready to take on your role.”*

I swallowed hard, wiped my face with my sleeve, and stood.

“I’m ready,” I said, my voice hoarse but certain. “I’ll do it.”

*“Good,”* Mr. Whitaker replied. “*Now step forward and return the dial to its original position.*”

I approached the radio, placed my hand on the worn brass dial, and slowly turned it counterclockwise.

It resisted slightly—then gave way—clicking back into place.

It wouldn’t turn anymore.

The room grew deathly quiet, like it was holding its breath.

Then Mr Whitaker finally spoke again.

*“Now go on Tom. Go upstairs and meet your family”*

I didn’t wait.

I rushed up the stairs, heart pounding, and reached the large doors. The key was already in the lock—turned. I gripped the handle, pushed the doors open, and stepped inside.

The air was warm—tinged with the faint scent of antiseptic and talcum powder. A television murmured softly in the background. George was sitting on the edge of the bed, legs swinging idly as he watched his favorite cartoon. Two suitcases sat zipped and ready in the corner next to him.

Cathy stood nearby in a beautiful floral dress facing the crib, gently rocking it with one hand, her eyes fixed on her new born daughter.

The scene hit me like a wave. I knew this day. I had lived this day. It was the day Cathy was discharged from the hospital after giving birth.

Cathy suddenly turned toward me, her eyes lighting up when she saw me at the doorway.

“*Took you long enough*,” she said with a tired smile, glancing at the paper in my hand. *“Why do hospitals take so long to get billing done?”*

I looked down, and there it was—crumpled slightly, but unmistakable. The discharge receipt. The ink still fresh.

She nodded toward me, her expression softening. “*Come here . Stand next to me*.”

 “*You know, Tom*,” she began as I walked over, still rocking the crib gently, “*we’ve been going back and forth the past few days, and I was dead against your idea at first…”*

She paused, lifting the baby with practiced ease, resting the bundle against her shoulder.

*“…but now I have to say—I like it. In fact, I like it very much.”*

She looked down at the baby, her voice warm and certain.

“*Dear Charlotte*,” she whispered, brushing her fingers over the baby’s cheek. “*Yes, sweetie pie. That’s what Mom and Dad have decided to call you. It took its time… but it’s been worth the while.”*

A few minutes later, we all prepared to leave. George slid off the bed and walked ahead without needing a word. Cathy followed with Charlotte tucked close to her chest, wrapped in a soft blanket.

I paused at the door, suitcases in hand, my eyes fixed on the threshold like it might shift or vanish beneath me.

I took a breath, then slowly lifted one leg and stepped over. The instant my foot landed, I expected to be back in the cold mansion, but I found myself standing in corridor of a busy hospital.

Ahead of me, Cathy moved briskly, Charlotte in her arms. George turned to glance back and gave me a grin before pushing open the double doors at the end.

We emerged into the sunlight of the hospital parking lot.

Cathy climbed into the back seat with Charlotte, carefully adjusting her dress as she cradled the infant. George slid into the front passenger seat beside me

As I got behind the wheel, I glanced in the rear view mirror.

Charlotte was nestled comfortably in Cathy’s arms, but her eyes—those tiny, unblinking eyes—were staring straight at me through the mirror.

Locked in.

For a long, impossible moment, she didn’t blink.

And then… she closed her eyes. Slowly. Deliberately. A silent gesture of completion.

I gave the faintest nod in return. I understood.

Then, I looked at my own reflection in the mirror. I looked tired and worn out.

But at the same time, I could hear a voice—excited—echoing louder and louder in my mind with each passing second.

*“Well done, Mr Whitaker, Well done. Freedom at last!”*

I started the car, turned on the radio and started driving.

Meanwhile, George sat silently, his eyes fixed on the radio, his face serious and contemplative. His fingers rose absentmindedly to his front teeth. He touched his incisor and paused—something about it bothered him.

And then, the radio flared into static.

A deep, ragged voice burst through.

**“Son… help me, son…..HELP ME!!!!”**
