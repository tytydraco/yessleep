Hey guys, sorry about not posting for a while. The internet went down and we had to figure out how to fix it. And yes, I said we. I will get to that, though.

Since my last post you guys have given me some incredible advice. I would not be alive without you guys. I think that I will survive until the end of this. And I thank you guys for keeping me alive for that first night after my post.

I have kept a journal of everything that transpired since my last post, and I will continue to update it until the snow is gone. Whether that takes months, years or even decades. This post is me copying down my journal so far.

I posted my situation on Reddit with the remaining internet. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to get another post out, though. However Someone reminded me that the clipboard that Mr Terry had was still downstairs, so I went back down and read the clipboard. It was a list of my family members with an X next to everyone but me. My name was highlighted in red with a note.

“my son, I Hope I don't have to kill you. If you are reading this, you killed me. I hope you don't lose sleep over that fact. I'm not exactly the person I made myself out to be. I have done horrible things. My death is an overall benefit to you and everyone around you. I'm only doing this because I have to to survive. If I kill your family before you kill me, I am sincerely sorry. My boss is very strict. I hope you can bring yourself to do whatever it takes to live on. This does not need to be the end.
Love...
Dad”

It's been a while since I read the note and I'm still shaken about that fact that he was my actual dad. He always seemed fatherly, but he was like that to everyone. The more I think about it, the more it hurts my brain, yet it makes complete sense.

After going to sleep, I had a really creepy dream. The whole world just covered in snow with me, alone, standing in a white void. It felt way too real. I hade to convince myself that I was actually awake after I woke up.

I convinced myself to go and grab my "dad" from the snow after someone wrote to me about the consequences of me giving up. I'm waiting for him to defrost right now. I have a camping stove I am going to use to cook him once he isn't a popsicle.

On another topic, after I find something to break through the roof with, I'm going to venture outside and find a taller building to take refuge in. I think I might be able to make it to Saint Paul where I can get into the Mall of America. Hopefully anyone inside will accept me once I get there. This apparently a worldwide thing. People are calling it the next ice age.

I think the snow is thinner near the top of the house, because that's the only place I can get internet. but the blistering cold will make it difficult to get very far once I break through. I forgot to mention it, but it's been around -40 degrees for the last few days. It's not that the sun went out, because a small amount of light makes it through the snow while I'm upstairs

I really hope I didn't just hear what I thought I heard. It was a scratching sound coming from the window. Sorry if this looks weird, I'm writing this as stuff happens. Freaky shit is going on, though it's not like this is a stereotypical horror story, so it can't be a monster or some shit. I'm going to go check it out.

It was just a cat. That was fucking scary, though. It was just looking for food. It was really cold so I brought it inside and let it lay on my heater. Poor thing was nearly frozen solid. I now have a companion, though. It's a cat so it might run away as soon as I get back upstairs

My dad is sufficiently unthawed, so I'm going to go cook now, I will hopefully update you all later. I'll try to just think “long pig” while cooking. Hopefully that prevents me from vomiting.

Until next time, friends.

Hey, it’s me again, Jason. I’m Sitting in a pile of snow right now with Devi. That’s what I named my cat. It’s been about a week since my last entry and I thought I might start writing down what’s been happening in the off-chance that I survive this.

I made it outside and it’s really hard to navigate towards the big city when you have no point of reference, so I just started walking in a direction that felt right. Progress has been slow, but it will be worth it, right? I actually met someone today that pointed me in the right direction. Apparently there’s a full settlement in the MOA, so I was right to start going in that direction.

I think I am about halfway there, but I feel like I’m being followed. And the presence doesn’t feel human. I think I need to hurry, but here I am, writing on a damn pad of paper while the… thing… could be nearby. 

On a brighter note, however, my cellular data is still working. Most of my friends have texted me to see if I’m alright. I told them that I was and where I’m heading. Preston still hasn’t texted back though. I really hope that he’s alright. 

Until next time, friends

Hey. It’s me again. I’m genuinely shocked that I’m alive after that encounter, though. The thing I wrote about 4 days ago caught up to me and it was DEFINITELY not human, but I can’t really say that it was an animal, either. It was digging through the snow with tendril-like arms. It’s entire body was a pale white, and it seemed to… warp reality? I’m not even sure what was happening. The space around looked like that wavy look that the air above hot asphalt has. I’m not really great at describing that effect. I think it’s called a mirage?

Anyways, it emerged from the snow and just sorta… looked through me Like I wasn’t even there, but it acknowledged my presence at the same time. It looked hungry, despite not having a face. The next few minutes were a blur, I don’t even remember what happened, just that I woke up surrounded by people and both of my legs were almost completely shattered. Someone heard me scream and came to get me. I was apparently unconscious for a day.

I’m sitting inside the caribou coffee shop right now. And I’m writing this after someone explained what happened to me. The creature was a complete illusion, caused by my long exposure to the snow. It was real, it can and did physically hurt me, but it is only able to harm someone after a full day of contact with what we’re now calling “pale snow”. Pale snow has a hallucinogenic property that causes the creature, which they decided to call “the snowy stalker”, to become visible to the human eye.

It cannot hurt someone unless they can see it. The Snowy Stalker is everywhere, yet nowhere at the same time. Really something that you have to see to believe it exists. Everyone sees it slightly differently, but it’s still the same premise. Long, lanky legs, short torso, tendril-like arms, no face, and its movements seem to be non-Euclidean.

I just realized that it might be a beast from the 4th dimension, considering that it moves in an extremely weird way, and everyone sees it slightly differently. Riley seems to agree after some thought. I’m being wheeled to the main area to tell people about my theory. If I’m right, then things are going to get complicated extremely quickly.

Until next time, friends

That was my last entry since I left my house. And I completely forgot to mention that day 3 of me being outside is when the internet went out. We have fixed it though. But we did lose Daniel to the snowy lurker. Apparently once someone has seen the lurker, they are never safe when on pale snow. The difference between regular snow and pale snow is that pale snow is completely 100% white. You cannot see the terrain of that snow. Imagine black 3.0 except white.

Devi is alright, and still sitting on my lap. I might lose my legs though. They really are shattered. 

One more thing I should mention is that my friends are on their way. I have warned them about the pale snow.

The doctor came to talk to me about half an hour ago and yeah, I will be losing my lower legs. It’s not as bad as it could have been, I could have lost my entire lower body, but I’m still pretty emotional right now. I will try to respond to any comments, though

Until my next post, friends
