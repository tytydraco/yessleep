It's been six long years since I lost my wife to a brutal murder. The pain has settled into a quiet ache, a scar on my heart. Life had moved on, or at least, that's what I thought until a stormy night shattered the silence.


A knock at the door, a sound so ordinary, yet it carried an extraordinary weight. Opening it, I found herâ€”my supposedly departed wife, standing there, soaked and disoriented. Disbelief hit me like a tidal wave. The mystery that unfolded was like something out of a surreal tale.
She couldn't recall the details of her death, just fragments of a blurry encounter with a shadowy figure. The authorities were baffled, reigniting the investigation into her murder. Our friends and family grappled with the surreal events, questioning whether it was an elaborate hoax or something more otherworldly.


The media pounced on our story, turning our lives into a public spectacle. In the midst of the chaos, my wife and I sought answers, consulting experts to unravel the enigma.
Skepticism surrounded us-was this an imposter, a long-lost twin, or some intricate cover-up? As my wife came down the stairs she had a knife in hand coming to me as I backed up and said what are you doing but before any more words could get out and then she stabbed me. She had then said " I was never your wife I was her friend. I had put on some makeup and a wig and fooled this entire fukng town Stabbing the knife in harder "I know how you killed your wife"


but then my eyes closed. In fact I did kill my wife. This was because the day she died I had seen her phone. And on her phone was some messages with her coworker, about how she ever liked me so the night of her death I went up to her room and stabbed her 27 times. I jump out of my bed realizing it was a dream. As I was getting up I had gone to see my "so called wife" and there she was sleeping on her bed. As I had gotten her up and asked her who she was.
She had said. Oh so you figured me out. With shock in my eyes regarding my dream I had rushed to the kitchen grabbing a knife but l was too late. That dream had came true. My wife's friend had stabbed me As my consciousness waned, the brutal truth unfolded. 

The specter of guilt and remorse haunted me, revealing the dark reality of my past. The supposed return of my wife was a twisted game, orchestrated by her friend, who sought revenge for my heinous act. In the dimness, I regretted the choices that led me here, realizing that confronting my wife with the truth could have spared us both. The echoes of my actions reverberated in my fading thoughts, and as the world slipped away, I grappled with the consequences of a life marred by deception and tragedy.
