Family is everything to me. It may sound cheesy, but it’s true. Ten years ago I was lucky enough to meet a girl who is now my wife, and five years ago I received the honour of becoming a father, and then for a second time only a few months ago. We are very much what most people would consider a “typical” family (husband + wife, two kids, house in the suburbs, slightly unaffordable car loan, you get the idea). It is something I personally wear as something of a badge of honour, despite it not being unique or rare. For me, however, it feels special, especially since my childhood was thwarted with uncertainty, chaos, and seemingly endless family dramas. I do all I can to make sure that my kids have a better upbringing than I did.

It is therefore something of an anomaly in my family that to this day, I am still on great terms with my elderly grandmother who lives alone. It’s something I’ve grown to treasure, especially in the absence of my other “family” members. We speak over the phone frequently, perhaps much more frequently than the average 30 year old. There is one big problem though, not only do we not live near one another, we don’t even live in the same country. You see, I’ve moved out of a rural village in Eastern Europe at a young age to seek a better life in the West (something many were doing back them) and to set up normal family life. The consequences of this was leaving behind my own family (most of who may as well have lived in other countries themselves), including my beloved grandmother. This meant that I am only able to speak with her by either using the traditional method of a telephone (as she did not have any tech beyond a digital radio), or in-person when I would go back to my home country, which did not happen more than twice a year on average.

Last year, I was scheduled to fly to see my grandmother as it was her birthday. My wife had been suggesting for a while to buy her some kind of gift that would allow her to speak with me via video. I always thought that this was a silly idea because I did not think she would be able to grasp any technology which required touching a screen (oh how wrong I was…). However, this year, I thought that it’s worth trying. So, I went out and bought a tablet that was capable of online video chats, and I flew out excited to see my grandmother and wondered what her reaction would be. 

Whilst I was not confident she would be able to understand my instructions on how to make video calls, I also knew that this was a genuinely intelligent woman. She spends most of her free time watching various news channels, so she is generally on top of everything that is going on in the world, and is acutely aware of the fact that devices such as the one I was about to give her is something that is used in everyday life. This obsession with the news concerned me. I could tell that she was too invested in it. Despite being highly intelligent, she typically believes everything that appears on the news, including the random ‘experts’ that tend to frequent these news shows. This is most obvious when she calls me up to tell me about the latest conspiracy theories in relation to world-domination, pandemics, climate change, you name it. I’m telling you this point with the benefit of hindsight. This was not on my radar when I made the decision to purchase her a product that increases accessibility to viewing this type of content.

Skipping forward a few months, I could not have been any happier with the outcome. I was now able to speak with my grandmother who means so much to me online via video. Being able to see her face whilst we talked meant a lot for me, and I knew that it meant a lot to her also. When we talked, we always covered every topic we could think of, including how my wife is doing, checking whether our health is good, asking about the kids, and of course, the latest batch of conspiracy theories. I initially did not pick up on the increased frequency of these, which seemed to have been growing in absurdity. She also started to use the phrase “what the news media won’t tell you is…” which is when I started to catch on. Could she really have figured out how to sign up to Twitter to see the batshit opinions shared by others? I showed her the App Store once, maybe she found something weird in there?

As the months went by, I remained on good terms with her but the frequency of the calls increased substantially and she only called me to tell me about the new theories (or what she started to call ‘hidden facts’) and nothing else. Before, she usually weaved these in at the end of calls, but now they seemed to be the only agenda item. The things she was saying also became uglier. I could tolerate the occasional comment about denying the existence of the pandemic or questioning manmade climate change, but she started to talk personally about people, and how they were lesser. When I asked where she is getting her information from, she replied that she and her friend watch this “intelligent man” on the tablet that I purchased her, and he tells them things about the world that nobody else has told them yet. The man seemed to me like a loony propagating dangerous conspiracy theories in return for clout and money. To them, he seemed to be the man who had answers to all their questions. Knowing this, I asked whether this “man” has asked them to pay or donate to them, and to my surprise they said no. Apparently, he was only there to give advice on how to lead a better, “uncontaminated” life. When I asked what exactly this entailed, my grandmother would shut down the conversation, and instead ask me about whether my acne had cleared up (it did, fifteen years ago). This concerned me greatly, and since it was her birthday coming up again, I knew I had to raise this again with her and take a look exactly at what she is watching once I arrive.

Visiting my hometown always served as a useful reminder as to why I left. I arrived at the train station in the evening, since my flight got in the late afternoon in the nearest city with an international airport two hours away. The snow has piled up as it usually did at this time of year, and I could only see really about thirty metres ahead of me because of the grey fog, only through which yellow lamp post lights and lights from nearby apartments could break through. This, combined with the very typical Eastern Europe housing estate aura (google *panelak* if you are unfamiliar), made for a very grim journey uphill to my grandmother’s apartment. After some time, I made it to the block of flats, and made my way up the worn down, decades old staircase of the flats, before reaching the fourth floor and ringing the bell. As always, my grandmother seemed delighted to see me and gave me a bear hug, and invited me in to immediately start feeding me the local delicacies. Her hospitality is something I could never have complained about. After a selection of soups, main courses, and deserts, I finally sat down as I always have on the chair towards the right of the room, facing towards the television, which to my surprise was turned off.

“Grandma, is your TV broken?” I jokingly asked. The TV has always been on and I genuinely cannot recall a time when the TV did not have one of the 24 hour news channels playing on it. My grandmother on the other hand, only seemed to be surprised at me for asking this question.

“The TV is off because it rots your brain” she firmly stated. “I thought your generation would know this best… about how it can manipulate you, lie to you, and distract you from your true purpose in life.”

I’d point out that she has never spoken like this before. It sounded as if she was some kind of preacher and not the normal down to earth grandmother I had come to know. Instead of pointing out the absurdity of this statement (as I don’t even know where I would begin), I asked her to explain further and asked her to show me what she now watches instead so that I can understand. I hoped this would help me try to steer her back on course.

“Too many these days think that the world revolves around them. They commit acts that are truly despicable and believe things that are told to them on the news. I found this man on your tablet who helped me discover my true purpose in life, and taught me how to lead the last few years I have on this earth”

She then took out the tablet I had given her (she must have dropped it a few times since then), turned it on, and showed me the screen where all the apps are. Every single app on the screen were the default apps that came with the system, with the exception of two: the app I installed for her to communicate with me, and another app which had no name and the icon were red and black chequered boxes. She masterfully clicked on the app, and instantly a man’s face appeared on the screen. The face was extremely realistic, but it was clear to me this was not a livened as it seemed somewhat computer generated. A little bit like a hyper realistic AI image where people have three nostrils. The man had a long face and tall, skinny ears which you could barely see. The most defining feature of his face were his eyes, which were bright blue, a probably twice the size of a normal person.

“Hello again Madam, I was starting to get worried we would not speak today” the man stated in a voice which was very clearly computer generated (think of the voices you here on short social media videos). “Do we have a guest again today?” He asked, his eyes turning to face me.

“This is my grandson Ryan, he has come all the way from England to visit me on my birthday. He will be staying here for the next few days.”

“Lovely to meet you Mr Ryan, it’s a shame that you are not one of your more typical guests of your grandmother’s, I was beginning to get a little excited” stated the man before disappearing off the screen. Once he did, the app seemed to close as the normal tablet page reopened.

“He does that sometimes” my grandmother explained “but he’s usually there when I click on the chequered button. He’s a really nice man once you start to talk to him you know”.

My grandmother started to put down the tablet at this point, as if what just happened was perfectly normal. I obviously had so many questions at this point.

“Is this the man you’ve been getting your news from?”

“Yes, he talks a lot of sense you know. He tells me all sorts about what his happening in the world and explains why things are the way they are. Actually, he’s better than the news readers because he also tells me how I can help in making sure that the world is a better, less contaminated place”

“Sorry, what exactly do you mean by this?”

“The best way to stop sinners is to rid them off this world Ryan, back in the day we used to do this, and in some parts of the world, it’s part of the justice system”

“And what did he mean by having your typical guests over?”

“Well, when I see someone who I know is a bad person or has done a bad thing in the past, I will invite them over for dinner and tea to discuss things. We usually talk about where they went wrong and what will happen to them as a result”

At this point I wanted to leave and firmly put my grandmother into the list of family members I will never speak to again. This was too weird even for me, but curiosity got the better of me and I had to ask further.

“And what does the man on your tablet propose will happen to them as a result?”

“Well, they die. I don’t like doing it, but it needs to be done to make sure that the world is less contaminated with sin and evil”

I should have left and ran away by now. This was not a normal interaction. I should have left and called the police and probably some kind of exorcist. I didn’t though. I was too intrigued in what my grandmother had to say. It did not quite hit yet that my grandmother invites those who she considers sinners into her house to kill them to help make the world a better place. Typing this out makes me feel sick. Instead of doing any of this, my immediate thought turned to the practicality of this wicked system. The flat was immaculate, and certainly not anything that resembled a slaughter house. That evening, I was in every room of the flat as there were only two. 

“What happens when they die?” I asked. I was not able to ask a more comprehensive question than this. I was shocked and in a state of incredible confusion.

“Well, I know that you are squeamish so I was not going to tell you this. But after the tea sends the sinners straight to sleep, my next guests help me to get rid of the body when I serve them dinner” she paused for a second to await my reaction “do you remember my friend Barbara? She was my last guest, and today the remaining parts of her have vanished… in you.”

Apparently this was my limit. This was also the day when I learned that in fight or flight I choose the latter. I practically jumped down the set of stairs leading out the block of flats and slid down the hill leading away from my grandmother. 

I am now sitting in the waiting room of my hometown’s run down train station. I have no idea what I should do or even where to start. This woman needs help, but preferably needs to be sent to an asylum. Why was that app installed on her tablet? Was she specifically chosen by some cult? How many people did she kill and made eat other people? Why are last minute plane tickets so expensive? What will I say to the authorities? Does anybody know of any good therapists?
