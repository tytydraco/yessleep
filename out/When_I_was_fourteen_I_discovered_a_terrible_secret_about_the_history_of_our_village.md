My best friend, Leelah Caldwell, had an unfortunate upbringing. Clara Caldwell, her mom, was known as the village crazy. I think that most people forgot her name after a few years, because by the time Leelah and I were old enough to walk into town by ourselves, we would only ever hear people refer to Clara as “the crazy lady” or “your crazy mother” if they were talking to Leelah. Her dad, Beau Lesnyk, lived on the opposite end of the village, down by the beach, and didn’t care one bit about Leelah or her twin brother Holden. The reason for his disinterest was rooted in Clara giving Leelah and Holden her last name, not his. This happened because Beau disappeared when he found out Clara was pregnant, and he didn’t come back until the kid's second birthday, when he showed up drunk at the party and threw up on the pile of presents that everyone had brought. 

Everyone seemed to be aware that Beau had made his bed and was refusing to lie in it, but all they talked about was how Clara had gone crazy because of her rebellious nature and her refusal to name her kids correctly. My parents both thought this was bogus, but they were outliers on that part. 

Now, if you asked Clara or either of her children about what had happened to her, they had a completely different story. Leelah and Holden both said that their mom had seen something. Something sinister, something so evil, that it shocked her to her core and rewired her brain. They said this thing got inside her and planted the seed of fear, and it had blossomed and dug its roots deep inside Clara’s soul, where it would stay planted forever. They said it made her act weirdly; it was why she attempted to chain Holden up in their cellar, claiming that she was just trying to keep him safe. It was why she wandered around the village sometimes, walking up to people and asking them about someone that nobody had ever heard of. 

In school, we learned about the origins of our village, and one of the stories that everyone was taught was about the God-like being that saved the village. It went a little like this: years and years ago, the early settlers were dying rapidly due to starvation and illness that ran rampant throughout the village. They were running out of places to bury the dead, and then one day, someone discovered a cave in the far east side of the village, a few miles in the woods. It was a large cave with a dead end, but they decided it would work to store the dead bodies that were piling up. 

One day, as some of the men were moving the bodies up to the cave— a slow and grueling process, considering how many bodies they had to move and how long it took to get to that side of town— they ran into something that was waiting for them just outside the cave.

This thing that they saw it told them the village belonged to it, and that the settlers had overstayed their welcome. It said it was responsible for the illness and death that permeated the village, and it all of this would continue until each and every person in the village was dead. 

According to the story, and the way it was written down all those years ago, the men were up by the cave for three days trying to negotiate with that thing. And finally, just before sunrise on the third day, they came up with an agreement. The men walked back into town and gathered the rest of the living settlers and told them what had happened and what they had agreed upon to guarantee their survival and safety: they were going to offer human sacrifices to this thing, and, in return, it would allow them to continue living on its land. 

Because most people had lost the majority of their families, it didn’t take very long to convince everyone that this had been a good call, and soon they were all in agreement. The deal was that they would offer human sacrifices to continue to live. There needed to be a balance, and this was how they would guarantee it. Since there weren’t many of them left alive, however, the thing had agreed to take the bodies of the dead as sacrifices; one for each person still alive.

Over the next few decades, this continued. In school, we read the writings of some of the early settlers and some of their descendants who wrote about this agreement years later, although a lot of the writings are partial, with missing details and smudged or missing portions of the writing due to how long ago these events took place.

Eventually, about forty years after the agreement was made, the thing vanished, and not a single sacrifice was made after that. Everyone just assumed they had paid their dues, or that this thing had died or moved on to collect sacrifices from a different village. And since then, we’ve been allowed to live in the village in peace, without worrying about the sacrifices. 

This thing, this creature that asked for human sacrifices from the early settlers, was the thing that Clara claimed to have seen. She said she saw it three years ago, up there by the same cave in the story, and that it had spoken to her and told her something. The people who believed her story at first tried to ask her about it and what it had said to her, but when she wouldn’t tell them, claiming that it wouldn’t allow her to share this ugly secret with anybody, they turned on her and began to tell everyone that she was crazy. 

My parents, who were usually contrarians, said they didn’t really know who they believed in this specific case. They acknowledged that it wasn’t right to give Clara the crazy label, but they never outright said that they believed she was right, or that they fully believed her story at all. 

One summer, when Leelah and I were fourteen, and her mom had been crazy for almost four years, we decided to sneak off into the woods and try to find the cave that this thing appeared to reside in. We wanted to see it, to know once and for all if her mother was telling the truth. We set off into the woods early in the morning and walked for what felt like hours, looking for the cave. Just when I started to think that Leelah’s mom had made all of this up, we found it. 

We pushed through thick foliage, scratching up our arms, and there it was. It looked like any other cave: a hole in a giant piece of rock. There was no menacing feeling like I had imagined; it all seemed so… normal. We stood there for a few seconds, mouths agape as we stared at the cave in front of us. And then after seconds of silence and surprise, Leelah jumped over a tree trunk that stood in our way and began walking towards the cave.

I hesitated, though, staying behind as I silently watched her approach the cave entrance. She walked right up to it and took two steps inside, looking around. 

“Hello?” I heard her voice echo as it bounced off the walls of the cave and into the empty woods. 

“Leelah, maybe we should-” She ignored me and fully disappeared into the cave. 

I sighed and then took three deep breaths before I followed, heading down toward the cave entrance and peeking inside. But Leelah had gone deeper, and I could no longer spot her blue sweater or her blonde hair. I took another deep breath as I stepped into the cave. 

It was dark inside, and it smelled and felt humid. I continued walking, keeping my left hand pressed to the wall of the cave as I went deeper, searching for Leelah. 

“Leelah?” I called, my voice bouncing back at me. 

I got no answer. 

I began to feel scared. Suddenly, the humidity in the cave was suffocating, making it difficult to breathe. The cave walls felt like they were closing in on me, about to crush me to death, and the smell of wet stone filled my nostrils, making me dizzy. 

I stopped walking, overcome by an overwhelming sense of doom. 

“Leelah?” I shouted, not caring about who or what heard me. 

“I’m over here!” She called, her voice coming from a few feet further into the cave. 

I forced myself to keep walking, keeping my eyes off the floor of the cave, afraid that I’d see the skeletal remains of the original sacrifices. After some of the longest seconds of my life, I found her. She was just standing here, waiting for me. 

“Did you find anything?” I asked her. 

Before she could answer, a deep rumbling started from within the cave. The wall under my left hand vibrated. 

“I think we need to get out of here…” I said, not waiting for her response. 

“I need to show you something first,” she replied. 

I shook my head, motioning for her to follow me back out, but she didn’t move. She simply stood there, staring at me. 

“Come on, Leelah, we have to go. You can tell me about what you saw once we’re out. I think this cave is going to collapse.”

As if on cue, the rumbling started up again, louder and stronger this time. I held my hand out toward Leelah, begging her one more time to leave the cave with me. This time, she smiled and took my hand, just as a blinding pain spread over the side of my head, causing everything to go black. 

When I came to, my vision was fuzzy. I blinked rapidly, trying to figure out where I was and what had happened. I was lying on the ground just outside the cave, and Leelah was sitting beside me, her arms hugging her knees as she cried softly. 

I sat up slowly, my surroundings still spinning slightly. 

"What happened?” I asked. 

Leelah lifted her head, turning to look at me. 

“Did you see it?” She asked. 

“She what?” I replied, confused. 

“Do you remember? Do you remember them?”

I stared at her in confusion as she scanned my face for any traces of these memories. As I looked at her blotchy skin and teary eyes, one thing came to mind. 

“Holden?” I asked. 

“And Jazmyn,” she nodded. 

I sat up straight, suddenly fully alert. “Wait. When?”

“I don’t know exactly. I think like two years ago. It’s been slowly coming back to me.” She wiped her face as more tears fell. 

“I-I don’t understand… How did we forget? How did everyone forget?”

We spent a few hours talking in the woods, trying to piece together the bits of our memory that were suddenly coming back to us in flashes. Eventually, in the middle of the night, we seemed to fully understand what had happened. 

The sacrifices never stopped. They were always happening, always necessary in order to keep the balance. The only difference was that now, nobody remembered them. After sharing our experiences inside the cave, we came to realize that I had never seen Leelah. At least, not the real Leelah. Instead, I had seen it. It had shown me the truth, what had actually been going on for all these years. It had shown Leelah, too, and shown both of us the truth about what was going on. 

The more we remembered, the more sense it made. I did remember Holden and Jazmyn. Holden, Leelah’s twin brother, and Jazmyn, my twin sister, both of whom had been taken by this thing. We had memories of playing together, all four of us, and the more time passed, the more vivid the memories became. 

I could remember Jazmyn’s face, her hair, how she liked to wear different colored socks, and she was allergic to peaches. I could remember Holden, too, how much he looked like Leelah, the freckles on his nose, how he would save up money he got from helping Mr. Patton gut fish to buy packs of his favorite grape bubblegum, and how he was my first kiss. 

Nobody else remembered, though. We tried. For a few weeks, we tried to remind people, but they began to treat us like we were crazy. The only person who believed us was Leelah’s mom, because she knew too. She had experienced what we had. She said it appeared to her as Holden. That’s what led her into the cave in the first place; she thought Holden had snuck off into the woods. By the time she realized it wasn’t him, it was too late. She had reached out to it, and she saw what would happen. She saw the truth, and saw it would eventually take Holden, and that there was nothing she would be able to do about it. She knew everyone would forget. 

After we spoke to her, she calmed down. She seemed more normal, more at ease. It probably helped knowing that other people believed her, that she wasn’t alone. 

As the years passed, we began to realize why Clara had acted so crazily. Once we remembered, once we knew what was going on, we couldn’t forget. I left the village, moved to a faraway city at the age of 19. It became unbearable to live there, especially after my mom got pregnant again with twins. 

Everyone had twins. Every single birth in that village was to twins. In the five years I lived there before leaving, I was painfully aware of one of the twins going missing. Nobody ever acknowledged it, though, because they couldn’t. I spent one summer tutoring twin girls, Julia and Trinity, and all I could think about when I saw their faces was, *which one of them will eventually go missing and be forgotten?* The answer was that Julia would, and the cycle would continue, without anyone being able to stop it.
