You know the moment when you're at the top of a rollercoaster? You know the feeling of the first 3, 4 seconds of the drop? As much as you adrenaline junkies say it's amazing, don't lie - it's absolutely awful, terrifying.

That's how I felt two hours ago.

*Clink.*

I live in one of these duplex type of homes - a house split in two. One side, mine. The other, the neighbor's. Or, right now, no one's. No one lives next to me. It's for sale.

Don't imagine it's something fancy - I've rented it out to have more room for my paintings. It has a simple layout: downstairs, my living room and kitchen, with a tiny service bathroom. Upstairs, two bedrooms, one mine, the other turned into a painting room, because I can't sleep in the smell of oil paint.

I was hanging up some paintings in the upstairs hallway, the one that shares a wall with the other home. As I raised my hand with the nail, and my hammer, I tripped (which was odd by itself, because I never trip on thin air) and, since my hand was already swinging, I quickly pulled my other hand, with the nail, away, afraid to hit my finger. My hammer went straight into the wall - carboard walls, typical to cheap American homes.

I stood there in silence, staring like an idiot at the hole I'd just made.

I hadn't expected the wall to be so *thin,* so that I could see the darkness from the other home. It was extremely odd and off-putting - I hated living next to no one. That home had been for sale for ages.

In the silence, I suddenly heard movement on the other side. Confusion, then fear, then disgust swept over me. *Please. No rats. It's all I ask.*

Hesitant, I peaked through the hole, trying to see the culprit. The other room definitely needed to have windows, so the darkness would not be too bad, I thought. Still, my mind was fuzzy: how on earth did I manage to break into the other home? How? I knew the term *paper-thin walls*, but I'd assumed that was just an exaggeration.

In that moment, I know I wasn't the wisest - it wasn't exactly the best decision to put my eye right into the opening of a stale, dusty room. Even if there *were* rats, that made it even more unsanitary. Those were the thoughts playing in my head, which were cut short all of a sudden.

I pulled away, eyes wide, mouth open, scarcely breathing.

There it was. The drop of the rollercoaster. Well enough, I'd seen another eye looking back.

The house was silent, but not a welcoming silence, or a comforting one, the one I'd gotten to know since living alone. No, this silence was like a being on its own. I felt it moving through my walls, and I feared it wasn't the only one.

*Clink.*

How do I know it was me who was looking back? Well, I have a scar on my left eyelid. Walked into a wire when I was a kid, lucky it didn't blind me. Two hours ago, I'd seen that same scar through the wall.

My mind raced for answers. *It's a mirror. It's a fucking mirror.*

That's what it had to be. The other room had a double-sided mirror on the wall. I put my finger through the hole, expecting to feel the glass.

I felt skin.

I think I've never screamed so loud before in my life. No, first, I think I gagged. I'm trying to remember the right order of things, but I can't. My throat is still sore from that scream. I could not think of a reasonable thing to do, because that wasn't a reasonable situation. What if it was a dead body?

No, I'd heard it moving.

I've been pacing through my living room since. I've stopped to type this, hoping someone might know how to help.

*Clink*.

From time to time, I hear this sound. A clink, coming from the hole.

The first time I heard it was an hour ago. It was almost imperceptible. Now, it's the same sound, but I feel like it's become deafening.

I turn to look, and I see that whoever is on the other side is dropping pins on my floor, through that hole. Clink. A pin falls, followed by another.

I don't know what's scarier - the fact that someone is on the other side - me, perhaps? -, or the fact that it knows I saw it.

It's a really thin wall, and I'm afraid something can break through it from any side. Tonight, I'm sleeping at my friend's.

Tomorrow, I don't know what I'll do. Wish me luck.

As I'm zipping my back up to leave, I hear another clink. I turn, and, from the door, I can see an eye peeking through the hole in the wall.

I get into my car. I'll hit post now, then fire up the engine and get out of here. I have one more thing to say - the upstairs room, the one stuck to my home, the one where the hole is supposed to lead, has no windows.

I don't know what's in there, and how long it's been lurking. I don't even want to think about the fact that for the last year I've been living next to that thing.
