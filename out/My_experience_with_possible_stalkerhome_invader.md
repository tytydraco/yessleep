Some backstory; I was with my ex for 7 years and we had 2 kids together. We stopped being in love long before we broke up, but we still stayed together for the sake of our kids. Eventually we did break up and she began dating a new guy, but I was still a co-parent and spent a lot of time at her house to help with the two kids.

During our time together for the last year or so before we split she'd get random deliveries of flowers and clothes, no name or note. There was no obvious choices for who this could've been, she had no (blatant) stalkers or people who had crushes on her. 

Then, when she began dating her new partner, on two separate occasions when he visited someone slashed his cars tyres. First one could've been a coincidence since its a rough area but twice seems targeted. 

When I'd stay over to do the night shift for our son (born blind, no regular circadian rythym, spent a lot of nights awake) there was at least two instances where me and the dog both thought we heard the door open - but by the time I got up to check there was nothing there. Just assumed it was my exes sister who lives across the street from her dropping something off after working night shift maybe. However around this time my ex did lose her keys, no idea where they went.

But then one Friday she was taking our daughter to school while I looked after our son before she went away on a weekend holiday with her new boyfriend. I was doing some chores for her before she left including laundry, namely bedding so I had to remove her bedsheets and such. Nothing was amiss in her room. She came back and I left, but we had the dog who I had to swing by to look after every few hours or so while she was away. 

So a few hours later I swung by to feed him and let him out, the dog gate at the top of the stairs was still fine and in place (dog had a habit of going upstairs to piss in our daughters room for some reason) so I left. I came back again around midnight, and as I was about to leave I saw the dog gate was propped against the wall. I assumed the dog had gotten upstairs so went up and checked every room, no piss but there was a condom wrapper on my exes bed. I assumed her and her boyfriend got busy when I left that morning as it wasn't there when I took the sheets off to wash, so ignored it and left. 

When she came back I brought it up, saying she should bin her condom wrappers incase our baby son finds it and chews etc? But she insists she doesn't use them, she has the implant. Then I remembered, the dog gate was neatly propped against the wall. If the dog got upstairs he'd have knocked it flat. 

So that leads to the current theory of whoever was sending her these gifts while we were together got salty that after we broke up she got with someone else. Slashed his tyres. Probably got a high from letting themselves into the house on a night, but quickly left once they heard me and the dog get up to check. Probably took the house keys one of these occasions. Then when she was away, let themselves into the house and left a condom wrapper on her bed to maybe cause an argument between her and her new boyfriend? Imply she was cheating? But the fact that someone was potentially entering the house with what I can only assume was bad intentions still freaks me out to this day.
