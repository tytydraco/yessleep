I woke up early to the sound of screaming. I couldn't see anything, but I could hear my brother's voice scream get quieter and quieter yet somehow more intense, as if he was moving away.

 

I tried to go to where I first heard his voice and though it is dark, I know my sister is there with me.  She is as scared as I am, but she doesn't know what happened to our brother either.  No sign of mom and dad either. 

Suddenly, we both feel a huge pressure or force almost crushing us from above.  The next thing I know, she too starts screaming and I can no longer feel her presence as well.  What is happening? Her screams too make it seem like she was lifted and taking somewhere. 

 

I decide to try to hide, but it's too late. That force occurs again, and I feel a huge pressure on both sides of my head.  I'm lifted into the air as my body writhes trying to get let loose.  I can see the morning sun just appearing over the lake and then darkness again. 

 

I'm with my sister again in a cold dark place with a metal floor. 

We've found my brother, but he cold and still.  His head was crushed, and he is no longer moving. We move to the other side of the circular room from him.

 

Terrified, I hug my sister and tell her it's going to be all right... but I know that it's not. I don't know what's happening and I'm scared too, but I just want her to feel ok. 

 

A bright light, then screaming and someone else falls in from the light. 

I don't know who they are, but they are as scared as I am.  About 15-minutes pass and finally our neighbor falls in.  "Have you seen our parents?" I ask.  Silence.   Then he finally answers me..   
“I thought you knew.. they were taken a few hours ago in the wee hours of the morning. I’m so sorry.”  
  
My sister and I are crushed at the news. 

As we settle in our new life, I go over to my brother's corpse to morn when the light appears.  My brother is lifted into the air but he is quickly thrown to the side.  I guess because I was standing next to him, I am then  lifted into the air.  I know that I can't fight it.  I yell goodbye to my sister and pray. Maybe there is something that I can do to stop whatever happens next and save her.  

 

I can see the lake and as I am being held there by my neck, I feel an immense pain in my back and then gut. I look down to see something sharp has been pushed through me.  It is a pain that I can’t even describe.  I try to get away but I can't.  I feel the pressure release  around my neck, but now  I'm left there to hang by the sharp thing that is sticking out of my belly. 

 

I feel the force of wind as I free fall down, but then I’m pulled by the thing in my stomach back into the air again then whipped back into the air away from and then into the lake.  I feel like I'm being torn in two with the whiplash that I feel emanating in my belly. 

 

I feel the freezing cold morning lake water surround me, with the sharp thing in my belly.  I think if I move around, I might just be able to get myself free.  I want to live.  I want to save my sister. I want to see my parents again.

 

As I try to squirm my way out of this trap that I appear to be in, I can see something large in the water.  The water is murky, so I can’t see what it is, but I know it’s huge and that it's coming right for me.  There's nothing I can do.  Its gets closer and closer and I struggle and struggle to get myself free, but to no avail.  This huge monster, the likes that I’ve never seen before in my life that has lived in the lake this whole time opens its mouth and swallows me whole.  

 

The last thing I feel is my body literally being ripped in half by a sudden jerk backwards while I'm inside the monster's mouth.  It was quick luckily, but in my last moment I also felt despair that the same fate was to

 

From the shore...   

 

"Hey Bob!! Check this one! It's gotta be at least a 10-pound bass!!! "

"I told you nothing beats live bait."  
“Absolutely.  We’ve pulled in quite the haul.  Might even have to go find a third batch of worms if this keeps up!”
