I went back to the *SunnyShore Suite*, only to find someone else at the reception desk. This new girl was younger than [“Tired Tracy”](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yjrp48/i_was_an_aspiring_journalist_and_i_was_following/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and much more perky. Annoyingly so, in fact. “Well hello there, sir! How can I help you?”

“Uh... um, hey, uh... I was wondering, what happened to the lady that was here yesterday?”

“Hm? Oh, her? Well...” she gave me a plastic sort of smile and giggled. “She said she just didn’t have the spirit for this anymore. But I’m here, and I hope I can make your stay with us unforgettable!”

I just stood there looking at her, wondering just how much ecstasy she popped before I walked in the building. Admittedly, this further started to freak me out. Clearly something was up. Not only was “Tired Tracy” gone, but the alibi on its own was suspicious as all hell, made even worse by the fact that I HAD seen what happened on the beach.

“Oh, well um... In that case, I’ll be heading back to my room.” I chuckled nervously before turning and heading toward the room. Behind me, I heard the new girl call out to me “Okay, if you need anything, sweetheart, I’m just a whisper away!” I looked back briefly to see her standing at the other end of the hall, big ass grin plastered on her face, waving at me like she was one of those inflatables at a car dealership.

*Freaky ass receptionist now. Great...* I got back in the room, slamming and locking the door after making sure I wasn’t being followed by freaky new girl, and stood for a moment in the middle of the room. I was stuck. I mean, the story was there — *I SAW IT* — but how the hell was I gonna get *others* to? I couldn’t take pictures anymore, couldn’t message Nolan, and I had no leads or witnesses.

*What am I supposed to do now?*

The answer, at least for the immediate time being, was  get another phone with a SIM card and get my phone working again. If nothing else, I needed to reestablish contact with Nolan if I was gonna at least have a shot of turning *something* in for *World of Weird*. I managed to pick up a relatively cheap burner phone and took the SIM card out of it before texting Nolan.

— “Nolan, it’s me, Max, you there?”

It was about another twenty or so minutes before he replied.

**— “Max, hey man, new phone?”**

— “Sorta. Listen, some crazy shit’s gone down here since yesterday afternoon, okay?”

**— “What kind of shit?”**

— “Dude, if I try and explain it here, I’m gonna end up dropping of a fuckin’ brain hemorrhage, okay? Just trust me, it’s beyond FUBAR here.”

***— “‘Kay... so what’re you telling me this for?”***

— “Well, have you still got the pics I sent you earlier?”

**— “Yeah.”**

— “Good. I ask, man, because I believe that what I saw, I wasn’t *supposed* to, if you take my meaning.”

**— “What?? Goddamn it, Max, didn’t I tell you** ***NOT*** **to go pissing people off?”**

— “Look, I didn’t do a damn thing, okay? All *I* did was report the body to the police. Next thing I knew, my laptop was getting smashed and I was getting dragged out of the suite in handcuffs!”

**— “Wait, you were ARRESTED?! WTF, man?! Why?”**

— “I don’t know! All I know is, after that, they confiscated my camera and the photos, and now, after what the fuck happened last night, now the few extra pics I managed to snag are gone, too. That’s why I wanted to make sure YOU still had a copy of them.”

**— “Well what’re you gonna do now, then?”**

I sighed. *Great fuckin’ question...*

— “Honestly man, for the moment, I have absolutely no clue whatsoever. I’m kind of tapped out with options for the moment without my camera.”

That’s when a lightbulb went off in my head.

— “Hey, how busy are you for the next three or four days?”

**— “I’m not. Off till Monday, why?”**

— “I’ve done just about everything I can here on my own. I was wondering, you think you’d be game for comin’ on down and checking this out with me?”

There wasn’t a reply for about another five to ten minutes after that. Funny enough, he almost wouldn’t have needed to. God knows I could hear his response coming a fucking mile away. Something along the lines of *”Have you lost your damn mind?!”*

*No, but I’m not far off from it...*

**— “You mean now, like right now?”**

— “Yeah...”

**— “I mean... fuck man, I COULD, but I don’t know how I feel about getting into some shit where I’d get arrested. You know I’m still trying to get my degree, right?”**

— “I know, I know... Look, I’m not trying to see you get in any trouble okay? But dude, something big is going on here. Trust me, if we can land this scoop, it’d be worth it!”

**— “Yeah, alright, you’ve twisted my arm, I’ll be there in half an hour.”**

— “Awesome, thanks man!”

After that, I sat on the couch to wait. To pass the time, I grabbed my notepad and began going over as much of the details of the case as I could remember. I started of course with the background details, such as the killings themselves and the rumor of the “SunnyShore Slasher”.

From there, I took note of the rumors I gathered myself from talking to the stoner gang and Ol fatso; with the individual conclusions being big government conspiracy on the one hand, and some tribal shit in the other. The connection between the two, having been established by both the cops and the Druid’s actions of sabotage, was that, whatever was going on with the mutant fish man and whatever the hell was happening on the beach, they obviously *didn’t* approve of prying curiosity and loose lips.

I decided to include the details of “human sacrifice on beachfront” as a side note. At least until I might be able to dig up a bit more as to just WHO the fuck they actually are. No sense in trying to emphasize a detail that only LOOKS weird like that, right?

*(I may be amateur, but I’m not fuckin’ Mystery Inc. here.)*

With all of that laid out, I began planning what my next move was supposed to be. Obviously the police was out of the question. I *could’ve* tried the locals again, sure, but even if I wasn’t being watched — something I wasn’t willing to bet on — I doubted there’d even be anyone on the beach. Not anybody with any real answers, anyway.

No, my best hope at this point was to hope that A, Nolan brought a spare camera with him and B, that we’ll get “lucky” enough to get another shot at getting fish man and his little fan club in a couple of group photos. At least then, we’ll have *SOME* tangible proof that this shit was real. Of course, I also realized that, pic or no pic, those alone weren’t gonna hold up in court. Not considering how much they’ve managed to keep this shit under lock and key for so long, just with a weak ass story like “Shark attacks”.

I was gonna need something bolder. Something I could actually show to people. Some kind of DNA sample or something from fish man himself. Therein laid the rub, though. How in the fuck was I gonna pull *that* off? To start, it was by pure *accident* that I came face to face with him last time. Even if I *did* know when and where he’d come back, though, how was I gonna get a fuckin’ *DNA SAMPLE* off him?

*”Hey, Mr. fish dude, sorry to bother you, but uh... could I like... have a sample of your spit or something? Nice biceps, by the way, how much you lift?”*

Yeah, like I’d be *that* charming, even to a fish man. So trying to confront him directly with that was out, but then, what was my next option? Well, the answer to that actually hit me out of the blue; talk to the stoner kids again.

I know you’re probably wondering just how the fuck *that* was supposed to help. Believe me, at first, I was right there with you. But the longer I kept sitting there, replaying the incident in my head, the more and more they began to stand out to me.

Think about it. Sure, most people could’ve passed them off as just that, dumbass kids — just like how the murders themselves could be so easily waved off as “Shark attacks” or like how just photos of the fish cult on the beach could (and likely *would*) get waved right off as “group cosplay of lovecraft on the beach” or some cockamamie horseshit like that. But I could see something else.

They were there, all of them, giving absolute B.S. stories. Again, in of itself, no red flag, until you take into consideration that they likely didn’t believe that story themselves. They were afraid of me when I wanted to ask them about the murders. Like I’d said before, I just *thought* it was because they thought I was there to bust them over a little bit of Mary Jane...

But what if it was something else? What if they, too, were afraid of me finding out something else? It’s a long-shot, sure, but what if, just maybe, they were in on that whole situation? Not only that, but what if perhaps they were in cahoots with the trigger-happy cops?

The more I thought about it, the more it seemed to start making sense to me. The problem again, though, was just how in the hell was I gonna be able to actually PROVE that? Moreover, what was it gonna cost me to do so?

It was about 4:30 or so when Nolan showed up to the resort. “Hey man, I’m sorry I’m late. Traffic was a bitch.”

“Really?” I asked, genuinely confused. Why was there traffic? The place was BARELY seeing any patrons...

“Yeah,” he said, sighing, “I guess because of the beach party they just tweeted about.” My eyes bugged.

“Beach party?” I asked, alarmed.

“Yeah... didn’t you know?”

“The fuck, no.” He frowned.

“Huh, weird. Here’s the tweet.” He held up his phone. It was a tweet with the picture of the beachfront with **”#SunnyShoreBeachBash”**

“What the fuck?! When was this?!”

“Just this morning, dude, what’s the problem?”

*This place is about to be an all you can eat buffet, THAT’S what!* I didn’t tell him this, though. He wouldn’t have been able to understand. He wasn’t exactly here, you know?

“Nothing, dude, just... did you bring your camera?”

“Yeah... both of ‘em, why?”

“Good, cause we’re going to that party.”

“Huh? Okay, but why?”

I just looked at him and told him to trust me on this. He held up his hand, relenting. “Trust me, if we’re unfortunate enough, you’ll see soon enough what I’m talking about come late tonight.”

Afterwards, Nolan and I got out the cameras and made for the beach. When we got there, sure as hell, the place was packed in tight. It was tough as all hell trying to even get out onto the beach, much less actually try to find a decent spot to snap some photos. All around us, throngs of people, mostly kids and young adults like the stoners, were moving and throwing down all over the beach to the loud ass music blaring over the speakers.

With a bit of shoving our way through, surprisingly enough, the two of us actually managed to Wade through the crowd *without* inciting an all-out brawl to the shoreline. Nolan started snapping pics of the tide while I kept on the lookout for either the stoners or the cops. The fact that I hadn’t seen either of them there yet only served to heighten my suspicions toward them.

Shouldn’t the cops be there, if nothing else then to *at least* make sure the party doesn’t get too out of hand or whatever? And the stoners, I mean, this was basically THEIR kind of party, right; weed, music and bikini chicks everywhere, I mean, *come on*.

Unless of course, they’re *not* just a trio of stoned teenagers...

I noticed briefly that the music, which had been blaring some sort of trendy hip-hop music, had changed a bit. It was sort of a subtle change, granted, one that you’d have likely overlooked unless you were on high alert like I was. It was about midway into the current song — of which you can forget trying to ask me the fuckin’ title of — that I noticed what sounded like a sort of deep toned drum pitch starting to crescendo.

At first, like I said, because of how well it managed to blend in with the actual music itself, I almost waved it off as just the bass from the speakers acting out. That is, until the beats got louder and louder. Steadily, the drums pounded harder and harder, shaking the ground, reverberating through my body. Listening closer, too, I noticed these weren’t exactly just any drums, either.

The slow rhythm of the pounding, along with the rather hollow sound of the drums themselves suggested they were the tribal sort of drums, similar to what natives used to use. This was then noticed to have a sort of deep throated kind of choral vocalization to it. A sort of call almost, one you’d expect to maybe hear from a whale, either for mating or for feeding.

*Feeding...*

Squinting, I looked over to where the music was blaring from. That’s when I saw, to my shock, that the drums weren’t coming from the speakers at all. Over at the far edge of the beach, the two druids from the previous night were standing there, watching the crowd while beating the drums. I looked up to the sky; the sun was nearly down to the horizon, bleaching the sky red.

I looked over to Nolan, who was still snapping pics of the sunset. I looked at my phone and caught another surprise. It was only 5:15. The sun shouldn’t have been going down for at least another hour or so. The drumbeat *really* began picking up then.

Still, somehow people weren’t seeming to notice. I, however, noticed the way in which the chorus escalated from guttural throat singing to an almost ear-splitting shrieking noise, similar to the ones I’d heard from the masked man the night before. I noticed it was also a little more distanced from the beach, despite still sounding so clear, at least to me anyways.

I then spotted him, the masked man, standing at the top of one of the lifeguard decks with his arms outstretched. I noticed this time he had a staff or something in his hand as well. Whatever the hell it was, it was *glowing* as well!

*What the hell is THAT?!* I wondered before crumpling to my knees and covering my ears. Out of nowhere, the masked man’s screeching was ringing in my ears so hard, I would’ve sworn he was taking a power drill straight to my ear. No matter how tightly I pressed my hands to my ears, either, I couldn’t muffle it a single bit.

It was like the man’s screeching wasn’t actually in my ears at all, like it wasn’t *actually* something I was hearing, but instead something I was sort of *sensing*, if that makes any sense at all. Basically, like the masked man was trying to scream at me, but telepathically, where only I could actually hear a damn bit of it, as evidenced by the fact that, again, *NO ONE ELSE* could hear this.

The screeching eventually took on a sort of discordant effect in my ears, like it was being passed through a fan or something. That’s also when I began to hear words, or at least *some* kind of articulation similar to words, whispering to me. To try and pronounce the actual “words” themselves would be a fuckin’ nightmare in of itself, trust me.

Basically, though, just try — emphasis on *try* — to imagine what you’d think a mutant fish man with the voice of a snake underwater would sound like trying to form words, and well, you’d (sorta) have an idea of what it sounded like. Understanding or not of what it sounded like, though, I’d have been *DAMNED* if I had any fuckin’ clue as to what any of it *meant.* what was even more nerve racking was the question of why *I* was the only one hearing it.

I felt myself being shaken . “Hey man, you okay?” a faint voice asked. Because the man’s weird screeching was still running rampant, it was almost half a minute before my mind could even register the kid’s voice. I looked up to see him standing over me, gently shaking me by my shoulder.

I saw others beginning to crowd around me. The screeching slowly dissipated and I could start to hear the music and chatter more clearly again. I looked around me, seeing about at least twenty five or thirty people gathered around, staring worriedly at me, whispering *”Is he okay? Do we need to get the paramedics out here?”*

“Are you okay, sir?” Repeated the kid standing over me.

I looked back up to him, exchanged another passing glance around the group around me, and replied “Y-yeah... yeah, I’m... I’m fine.” I then slowly made my way back up to my feet with the kid’s help. Once back up, I looked around again. The sky was half dark now. The masked man was still there, standing on the pier, now with his arms by his sides.

*What the fuck was happening to me?* I wondered. I could see both the masked man and his three druids were all facing the ocean. Facing *me* almost, or so it looked and felt anyways. My heart began racing and I pushed my way through the crowd to find Nolan. I was stopped again, though, when another roar blasted through the air. This one was deeper, earth shaking and this time, I wasn’t the only one who heard it, either.

People everywhere swung their heads toward the ocean where it came from. I could hear them anxiously whispering and crying out, “*”The heck was THAT?!”* Not me, though. I was trying to get to Nolan. I knew what was coming, and I wasn’t wanting to be around to see what it’d do with the crowd that was gathered there.

I found him standing along the shoreline. “Nolan, come on man, we gotta get out of here, now!” He didn’t move. “Nolan, you hear me? Come on!”

I got closer to him, putting my hand on his shoulder. “Dude, what’s going o—“ I stopped. Nolan stared straight out to the ocean, his face completely albino and his jaw hanging numbly.

“M-Max...” he whispered, shuddering in utter fear. “What in the name of fuckin’ God is that?” I looked out toward the tide again. Then *my* face went white.

Just a few miles out from the shoreline, approaching rapidly, was the largest webbed dorsal fin I’d ever seen cutting viciously through the water. *Oh Jesus! It’s here!* I turned to Nolan. “Listen, take a photo of it, then we gotta get these people off the beach, understand?”

He stood still. I could feel him quivering in fear. I shook him and said ”Nolan, hey, stay with me, do you understand?”

“Huh?” He said, snapping from his trance. He exchanged another look toward the ocean and back to me. The fin was only a few feet away, coming in hot. “Yeah...” he said finally, raising his camera. “I-I got ya.”

I turned right as he snapped the photo. “Everyone!” I shouted, “We have to get out of here, now!” They all stood staring frightened at me for a moment like how Nolan was. “Come on!”

“Max!” Nolan cried from behind me. I spun around and saw that fish man had risen from the water. He leered down at Nolan.

“Nolan, get out of there!” It was too late, though. Nolan had *just* enough time to spin around on his heels and attempt to run before the fish monster wrapped its entire tenebrous webbed “hand” around Nolan’s head and jerking him backward. I was about to rush over to *somehow* try and help him, but before I could take even two steps more, the creature had Nolan gorilla-pressed above its head and, in another flashing instant, effortlessly ripped his head and neck away from his shoulders.

That’s when the crowd around me finally erupted into a cacophony of shrill screams. All at once, hordes of people began clamoring over each other, frantically fleeing from the beach. I was frozen, paralyzed, and more than anything, just straight *disgusted!* I wanted to puke right there on the beach until there wasn’t anything left in me, but at the same time, I felt like my stomach, as well as the rest of the muscles in my body, was just frozen.

I watched fish man throw it’s scaly head back, cramming Nolan’s torso in its mouth while hurling his head like a baseball. Nolan’s head landed just 4 or 5 feet away in the sand, immediately being trampled on from the fleeing beach goers. Fish man let loose another deafening, earth-shaking roar that reverberated through my body like it was gelatin.

I finally broke and took that as my cue to haul ass. Obviously, getting off the beach was a nightmare, even more so than getting in. That wasn’t just me, either. Everywhere I looked, some poor bastard or child — and yes, even some of them were *actual* fucking *children!* — was getting stomped into the sand without a second fucking thought.

I made the mistake of looking back and saw fish man approaching, taking huge, lumbering strides like he did before. It wasn’t long before he was upon the crowd, grabbing people left and right and ripping them apart and roaring to the night sky above. Soon, blood and body parts were raining down all over the beach as a monsoon. I did my damnedest to ignore this, as well as the screams of terror and pain that surrounded me on all sides and try to push onward.

This all proved useless, however, as it was virtually impossible for me to break through the wall of people in front of me.  I managed to make it about a quarter to *maybe* halfway in before I was joining the other unlucky sons of bitches on the ground, being trampled over. I couldn’t see anything, save for sand and the soles of people’s feet stoving my head in.

At one point, I was sure I could hear the bones in both my arms, as well as my rib cage, snapping. I was laying there, in the sand, coughing and wheezing, having one foot after another crush the life out of me slowly. Before too much longer, my vision began clouding over.

Darkness crept upon the outlines of my vision. Stomp after stomp rained down on my head. Each time, it felt like the next one would finally flatten me. Just before my vision would go out completely, though, I both heard and felt fish man stomping toward me. *Fuck, this is it.*

I blacked out after that, having taken yet another foot to the face. The way I saw it, even if, by whatever miracle fish man *didn't* decide to rip me apart, the constant head trauma would've done me right in. In short, imagine my surprise when I *actually* woke the fuck up again. Though, this brought me no relief when I saw what I'd woke up to.

It was pitch dark out. Everything was quiet, still, save of course for the tide. I couldn't see anything at first. My head felt like it'd been stuffed with several bricks of lead and pain made trying to move my body, especially my arms, nigh impossible. I managed to work my way up to a sitting position and looked around. The wind was still, like it, too, was just too scarred beyond belief to even fucking make a sound. I shifted around, finally and painfully working my way back to my feet.

I attempted to stagger forward, only to trip and faceplant over, what I think, was a discarded arm or leg. Trying to get up the second time took a bit more effort, but when I did, I heard that weird chorus again coming from far off to the right end of the beach. I looked over to see three figures kneeling down in front of the shoreline with their arms raised, holding a torch in their hands. Thankfully, I actually still had my camera, and from what I could tell, it, by some divine miracle, *wasn't* crushed to pieces. I struggled to stumble closer, trying not to make noise so that I could snap a picture of them.

Whoever they were -- well, maybe I should say *whatever* they were -- I wasn't about to leave this place without *some* kind of proof of them, of what they've done. So long as they don't see me, and so long as from that point on, I kept a reasonably low profile, I'd be able to actually return home with a story for *World of Weird.* Then... Then at least Nolan and everyone else on the beach for that matter, might not have completely died for nothing. So I figured anyways.

I managed to get to a distance where I could *semi*\-decently make out their forms, at least enough to where they couldn’t, at least in my opinion, just easily be brushed off as “shadows” or “tricks of the shadows” or I don’t know, *SOME* sort of horseshit scapegoat for it being anything other than what the fuck I knew it was. Well, *sort of* knew it was. What, you expected me to just waltz up and *ask* “Hey, so uh, are you like, a cult or something?” Fat fuckin’ chance. As far as I could care enough to know, who or whatever they were, they *weren’t* human, and they *weren’t* friendly.

My plan for stealth ended up being blown out of the water — pun intended, I guess — when I snapped a pic of the group, not exactly being careful enough to make sure the flash wasn’t noticeable. *Maybe* two seconds after the pic snapped, one of the hooded druids snapped their head over to me. That was when I was essentially forced to turn and limp away as fast as I could, all while trying not to trip and fall on my face again over another randomly discarded body part.

I guess *some* small stroke of luck was still on my side, though. Not only was I able to maneuver through without stumbling over anything (in the dark, by the way), but along the way, I came across the glint of something reflective in the moonlight laying in the sand. Without stopping, I snatched it out of the sand, realizing it was Nolan’s camera. Beside it, presumably anyway — it was hard to tell in the dark — was his shredded torso, laying on top of about 20 or so others. Now I’d have whatever pictures he took in his last moments, along with the one I took of the figures.

I managed to make it, seemingly by the bare skin of my teeth off, of the beach. When I was back on the boardwalk, I turned around to see that they hadn’t actually followed after me. I was relieved by this, but wasn’t taking any chances, so I turned back around and kept going until I made it back to the suite building.

Keep in mind that I was running off pure adrenaline by that point and it was fading fast. I was able to make it all the way into my room before I collapsed onto my bed. Oddly enough, though, I didn’t actually fall asleep. Instead, I just laid there on my bed, surrounded by quiet darkness. My joints felt tight. Trying to move any part of my body resulted only in my entire body racking with pain.

My mind was essentially a blur. I couldn’t seem to focus on one single thing with what’d happened. Rather, everything just cycled through my mind sort of simultaneously like a hive of hornets. Images flashed across my mind like slides on a projector, one that just constantly looped.

Every two seconds. My mind was bouncing between either scenes of blood and body parts flying everywhere and the weird sort of call they did right before fish man even showed up. That got me thinking; what *was* that exactly?

Yeah, yeah, I know, “mating call” or whatever, right? But then, how come only *I* could hear it? Why was *I* the only one that seemed to notice them, and why was *I* seemingly the one fish man and the others let go? I mean, the fucker had me *right there*, a TV dinner essentially — *MULTIPLE TIMES* — but yet, here I was, still in one piece, likely the only one in *SunnyShore Resort* who could say as such.

Don’t get me wrong, here, I was *more* than grateful for this, but nevertheless, I still couldn’t help but find this both confusing as well as a bit frightening. The only logical explanation I could come up with for why I hadn’t already been done in was that they had some unknown, probably horrific, purpose for me. One that apparently required me to be alive for.

My first thought with this was obviously that I was supposed to be some sort of offering on the part of the cult to fish man, but then, that’s just it; why had I not been torn apart and eaten yet like the others on the beach — on *either time?* So, okay, that ruled out live sacrifice, so what else was it? I thought again about how the cult themselves also let me go, multiple times, at least, from what I understood.

Why would *they’ve* let me go? *Why was I the only one who could hear their call to fish man?* The other possibility I considered was that I was left alive as a sort of messenger, spared to spread their “prophecy” or whatever. I *would’ve* believed this, except then why’d they remove the SIM card from my phone the night before? Not only that, but why *me?*

Why was I apparently so special to them? Especially if they really *didn’t* want me to spread the word about them, *plus* the whole beach massacre, it made absolutely no sense to me that they’d need me alive, unless...

Unless...

*”Don't need you going around trying to spook folks around here when it's clearly nothing but a shark attack."*

My body went cold. Could that *really* be it? Is *that* why they wanted to keep me alive; to try and convince people to come?

As much as I hated it, that conclusion began to make more and more sense to me. It would explain why they would want to leave me alive despite all that I’d seen. It would also explain, somewhat, *why* I was the one that their call was directed toward. That also put a new thought into my head, what if that *wasn’t* actually a mating call of some sort, but instead some sort of command?

Still, though, this all boiled back down to the question of “Why *ME*?” How would they’ve known I’d even be able to tell the public about *SunnyShore Resort*? What made them think *I’d* be able to convince anyone to come to the beach any more than the 50 other poor bastards they slaughtered?

This, too, clicked in my head not long after crossing my mind. They must’ve realized I was there to investigate. How, though, I mean, it’s not like I fuckin’ knew them...

Right?

That’s when I realized I’d been ratted out.

*She said to give her regards...*

Everything had now fully fallen into place. It made sense, and it was confirmed after that night. When morning came, I packed my shit up and left *SunnyShore Resort*. I didn’t even bother with the check-out desk, either. No, I just kept forward right past new girl receptionist and out the door without a single word. And no, I *still* don’t know what the hell happened to “Tired Tracy”, either.

Mrs. Trigger Happy and her partner were outside the suite building, seemingly waiting on me. I say “seemingly” because they didn’t actually try to stop or call out for me, or really notice me at all. That was, until I got to my car. That’s when I heard it again; the weird  chorus from the previous night.

I was beginning to panic and when I looked over, there they were, staring daggers at me. They knew I could hear it, just like they knew on the beach that night. *Just like they knew I was there to tell a story about the place.*

This was all back in June. I haven’t been back to the place since. And if I can help it at all, that won’t ever change. As I said at the start, *World of Weird* has already thumbed their nose up at publishing the article. No matter how much I begged, pleaded, fought tooth and fucking nail to get them to publish this story, I was hit with the same response; “This piece is far too speculative without any concrete evidence to support the allegations presented.”

Every time I attempted to point them to the photos, including the ones I’d had Nolan send in before he came to the resort, they brushed them off. It was illogical, all of their reasonings. But it wasn’t long before it clicked in my head as to why. I realized, somewhere along the way, the editor in chief at the press must’ve talked with those two “cops”, who undoubtedly convinced him that I was full of shit.

I was told that, if I was gonna keep my job with the press, that I was going to have to return to *SunnyShore* and find a “more believable” story. As you can imagine, I said to hell with it all and left the place for good. I wasn’t going to do the cult’s dirty work, regardless of if people believed it or not.

Since then, I’ve gotten a job as a cashier at the mega mart just a few miles away from my house. It sucks, I won’t lie, but the pay *is* actually a bit better than the bit of cash I was scraping with the press. I still would occasionally write articles for various other magazine companies, but I’d never tried publishing this story again until now.

See, it was last week when, while scrolling through my phone at work, I found an article on my Google feed about a “Fall festival beach bash” at *SunnyShore Resort*. Immediately, I was taken back to the night on the beach; the *SunnyShore* beach bash. That’s when I realized I couldn’t give up on this story.

Look, believe me here or don’t. I get it, this is all a lot to take in and bizarre. Believe me, I get it. But if you take nothing else away from this, then take this much away. There’s something vicious on the beach at *SunnyShore Resort*, and it’s not a serial killer, and it sure as hell isn’t a shark!
