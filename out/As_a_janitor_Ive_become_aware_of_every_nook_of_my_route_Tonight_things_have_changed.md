If I tell you I'm somewhere familiar, does that make it sound like I'm safe?

My name is Gordon Prewett, I am thirty-six years old, and I have been a custodian at Marshall High for the past four years.

It isn't so bad, the job. The bathrooms are atrocious (you would be horrified at the menstrual product bins in the girls' rooms; the boys' room, well. Let's just say pubic hair...everywhere), but truly, the repetition was soothing.   


Every night, I cleaned the same two floors. I made sure to hit the tight corner by the World History classrooms that the machines missed if you weren't careful. I brought a new air freshener every week to Mrs. Winslow's room, I knew she had ulcerative colitis or something like it, by the state of things. It might be gross, but it creates a gross rhythm that is my own, and in it I find comfort.  


I've been told I'm a “creature of habit” by more people than I can count. If a serial killer were stalking me, they would know my exact patterns within a day or two – I'd be screwed.  


As this day would have it, I followed my pattern as usual. I saw Jessie and Darren at the soda machine, drinking orange and purple Fantas, respectively. I always made it to a shift about ten minutes early, so I waited quietly to the side for our boss to officially set us loose. (I heard it didn't used to be this rigid, but some weird stuff was reported from some of the custodians before we had such tight rules, so we continue to bear them.)  


“Alright boys,” our boss Kevin said. Jessie shot him a look, but she rolled her eyes instead of getting into it with him. “You know the routes you're responsible for, so keep 'em clean. I'll see you in three hours for break.”   


We all gave each other a sort of saluting, understood gesture, not knowing it was our last.  


So we went.  


I liked my route, to speak candidly. I got the computer labs, upstairs bathrooms, art hallway, and the gym. I cleaned and buffed floors, scrubbed acrylics and oils from the art room linoleum, and plunged toilets. I made everything clean, everything nice again.It gave me satisfaction.  


I don't think the others felt the same way, saw it more as a gig for some bucks. Jessie and Darren talked a lot of smack about our boss Kevin, the mundane nature of our job, looking for something else, anything else. To each their own, I guess.I started in the computer labs, using my push mop to begin. The labs never got too dirty, somehow. I tended to smile while I cleaned them, knowing things were already orderly.  


Tonight I was listening to the audiobook for a Stephen King novel. I'm not one-dimensional, you know; I don't only like cleaning.

Anyway.  


The rhythm of push, buff, move chairs, repeat was a lullaby; between that and my audiobook, I was in another world as I let myself fall into familiar movements, without a thought. Noticing nothing.  


The bathrooms were astounding tonight, and took me about twenty extra minutes from my usual to get them suitable for use again. I didn't mind, though. I was still in my novel, in a familiar area. I knew it better than I knew the back of my hands, I thought.  


I popped out my earbud to pause at the AP Art mural. The class depicted a grotesque scene from Hieronymus Bosch between the two larger classrooms in the art wing. I always stopped to marvel at this piece – how delightful! How disgusting! How entirely delectable! I always put my push mop and cleaning spray to the side for just a moment to take it in: it was the high point of my night typically.  


Here's the thing – I only see it once. I take in the disturbing mural one time each night, oohing and aahing at the ghastly sights.  


Tonight, I stumbled to a halt when I found myself stopping to analyse the painting. Again.

Again?

I assessed my area quickly, finding myself in the art halls I expected. I rubbed a swatch of red acrylic paint from the tiles; my rag had an identical, red smudge just to the side of this new stain.

Perhaps I was too engrossed in my audiobook, I mused. And I should really start going to bed earlier.

Taking out my earbuds, I tucked them into my back pocket for safe keeping.

I continued mopping the floors, as my route took me past the gym. My night was coming to an end, and I was daydreaming about my bed waiting for me at home.

You can imagine my surprise when I found myself in the gleaming computer labs again, not the breakroom where we begin and end our shifts with a debriefing from Kevin.

I couldn't leave an area on my route uncleaned, so just to be sure, I mopped the labs again. Nothing clung to my mophead this time, not even a fleck of notebook paper.

I made my way to the bathrooms, and no tampons were wedged and bloody in the hinges of the waste baskets. There were no pubes on the back of the boys' toilets. I mopped my clean floor anyway.

I stood before the horrifying mural in the art wing, putting my mop and spray to the side, like the creature of habit I am.

This time, there was a larger red smudge on the linoleum. I knelt down again with my cleaner and rag, and the stain left the ground and found its way, largely, onto my cloth. My hands shook slightly as I rinsed my rag in the art room sink.

More intentionally this time, I take my route past the gym and hope to find myself – shit. I'm stood before the spotless computer labs again.

This time, I deviated from my routine. I didn't clean the pristine labs for a third time. I booked it past the bathrooms, and stumbled as I came to a stop at the AP Art mural again.

Now it looked different. Wet, maybe. But definitely darker – the pigments, I mean. A stain on the mural. I'm not an art restoration expert, but I began the tedious task at getting it clean once more.

Some areas were thick like jam. It wasn't until a small slick of yellow shone through that I realised – I hadn't seen Jessie or Darren once in my route. And this was definitely viscera.

I noted a trail down the corridors of my route, and I brought my mop all along with it, cleaning as I went. Heaped in front of the gym, I found the broken bodies of my coworkers.

I stifled a cry, and stood back for a few minutes to take in the horrific view.

I sighed – I was going to need my bleach for this, and my cleaning cart, well. It was back at the start of my route.
