I slumped onto my tired, lumpy couch, the cushion sagging under my weight as if it shared my exhaustion. In one hand, I held a bowl of popcorn—my dinner, I guess—and in the other, a remote that felt heavier than it should. It was Friday night, and the week had chewed me up and spat me out. My small apartment felt like a cave—silent, except for the occasional creak of the pipes hiding in the walls, as if they were whispering secrets I couldn’t quite catch.

I had splurged recently—well, "splurged" was a stretch. I bought a secondhand TV. Big, bulky, and glossy in a way that screamed early 2000s, it felt like a relic from my childhood. It wasn’t one of those fancy smart TVs that everyone flaunts now, but it worked. Cable and DVDs were all I needed. I’d set it up in the corner of my living room, and somehow, that clunky box had become the heart of my quiet little world. Tonight, I was ready to let the glow of old detective shows pull me away from reality, at least for a while.

With a deep sigh, I clicked the remote, and the screen roared to life—or tried to. Instead of the soothing, familiar channel menu, the TV erupted into static, bright and loud, like it was screaming at me. “Damn it,” I muttered, smacking the side of the TV. It gave a flicker, like it was thinking about behaving, and then finally stabilized.

Flipping through the channels, I tried to settle into my usual routine. But the static wouldn’t quit—it kept barging in every few seconds, ruining the sound and the picture. My frustration bubbled up. “This better not be broken,” I grumbled, dropping the remote and leaning forward. My hands fumbled with the cables at the back, trying to coax the thing into working.

That’s when I heard it—a low hum. It wasn’t just noise. It was alive, rising and falling in waves, almost... rhythmic. I froze, my fingers gripping the cable so tightly my knuckles went white.

“It’s just interference,” I said to myself, my voice shaky but determined to sound convincing. But even as I stepped back, the sound grew clearer. It wasn’t just a hum anymore. It was a voice. Whispering. Calling.

At first, the voice sounded like a tangled mess of whispers, too garbled to make any sense. But the more I stared at the TV, the static cleared, just for a heartbeat, and I heard it. Clear as day.

“Help me…”

My breath hitched, caught somewhere between disbelief and fear. It wasn’t just a noise—it was a voice. Soft, trembling, undeniably human. A woman’s voice.

“Hello?” I croaked, my voice shaking so much it hardly sounded like mine. Talking to a TV felt ridiculous, but I couldn’t stop myself. I had to respond.

The screen flickered violently, jagged lines tearing across it, as if the TV itself was struggling to breathe. And then the voice came again, barely more than a whisper:

“Help me… he’s watching…”

I stumbled back, my heart slamming against my ribs. The static grew louder, the flickering light on the screen bathing my tiny living room in bursts of erratic, white-hot flashes. My pulse thundered in my ears, drowning out everything but that eerie whisper.

And then, as quickly as it began, it stopped. The screen snapped back to normal, displaying the dull, predictable channel I’d picked earlier.

I let out a shaky laugh, more of a nervous exhale than anything else. “Great,” I muttered, forcing sarcasm into my voice to drown out the chill creeping down my spine. “Guess I need a new TV.” But deep down, I wasn’t sure if a new TV would fix… whatever *that* was.



The next morning, I decided to return to the little electronics shop where I’d bought the TV. It was a cramped, cluttered place run by a wiry man in his fifties named Frank. When I walked in, he greeted me with his usual toothy smile, the kind that seemed too cheerful to be genuine.

“Back already?” he said, raising an eyebrow.

“This TV you sold me…” I started, holding back the urge to just blurt everything out. “Something’s wrong with it. Keeps glitching. Weird sounds, voices in the static.”

Frank’s grin faltered, his eyes narrowing slightly. “Weird, huh? What kind of weird?”

I hesitated. Saying it out loud made it sound even crazier. “Like… like someone’s voice,” I finally said. “A woman’s. It’s probably just interference or something, but it’s…” I trailed off, shaking my head. “Creepy.”

Frank’s face went pale. He glanced around the shop, his movements sharp, like he was checking for hidden cameras or something. Then, lowering his voice, he leaned closer.

“That TV,” he whispered, his tone heavy with unease, “came from a storage unit auction. Belonged to some guy who lived way out in the woods. They found him dead in front of it—heart attack, they said. But some folks…” He paused, swallowing hard. “Some folks think it was the TV that killed him.”

I blinked at him, stunned. “You’re joking, right?”

Frank shrugged, his expression grim. “Look, I’m just telling you what I know. Strange things happen with that TV. If you don’t want it, I’ll take it back, no questions asked.”

I wanted to laugh, but my throat felt too dry. Curses? Haunted TVs? It was absurd. I didn’t believe in stuff like that. But still… The memory of that whisper crawled under my skin, refusing to leave.

“I’ll think about it,” I said, my voice quieter than I intended. Without waiting for a reply, I turned and walked out of the shop, leaving the answer hanging in the air behind me.



That night, the unease wrapped around me like a heavy blanket. I couldn’t shake it off, no matter how hard I tried. I grabbed a cold beer from the fridge, hoping it’d calm my nerves, and sank onto the couch. The TV loomed in front of me, its glossy screen reflecting the dim light of the room.

For the first hour, everything was fine. I flipped through the channels aimlessly before landing on a late-night horror movie. It felt ironic, considering how jittery I already was, but I convinced myself it was just a distraction.

As the movie crept toward its climax, the screen flickered. My stomach sank. “Not this crap again,” I muttered, my annoyance barely masking my growing fear. I grabbed the remote, pressing buttons, but the static roared back, louder than before, filling the room with its deafening hiss.

And then, like before, the whisper returned.

“Help me…”

The words felt like icy fingers trailing down my spine. My pulse raced as I leaned forward, my beer forgotten on the table.

“Who are you?” I whispered, my voice trembling.

The static shifted, the chaos on the screen beginning to form something… someone. My breath caught in my throat as a face emerged—a woman’s face. She was gaunt, pale, her hollow eyes wide with terror, as though she’d been trapped in this nightmare for far too long.

“Help me…” she said again, her voice drenched in despair. “He’s watching… he’s watching you…”

Before I could respond, the screen went black, leaving only my reflection staring back at me. My own wide, terrified eyes glared at me from the glass.

And then the TV turned itself off.



I didn’t sleep that night. How could I? Every shadow in my apartment seemed alive, every creak of the old walls felt like someone—or something—was moving just beyond my sight. The feeling of being watched was suffocating, but no matter how many times I checked, the apartment was as empty as ever.

The next day, I did everything I could to ignore the dread bubbling inside me. I avoided the TV like it was a ticking time bomb, distracting myself with a book, pacing the apartment, anything to keep my mind occupied. But as night fell, my curiosity—and maybe some twisted need for answers—got the better of me.

“It’s all in your head,” I told myself firmly as I sat on the couch. My voice sounded hollow in the silence.

With a shaky hand, I turned on the TV, bracing myself for the static.

The screen came to life, but this time, it didn’t flicker or display channels I recognized. Instead, it showed a dimly lit room. At first, it didn’t register, but then my breath caught in my throat.

The room on the screen was mine.

I stared in disbelief at the image of my own living room displayed before me. The camera—or whatever it was—seemed to be positioned in the corner, capturing me sitting on the couch from an angle I’d never seen before.

“What the hell?” I muttered, my voice cracking. My legs felt like lead as I stood and scanned the room, looking for any sign of a hidden camera. I pulled aside cushions, checked the shelves, and even ran my fingers along the walls, but there was nothing.

When I turned back to the TV, my blood ran cold.

The angle had changed.

It was now zoomed in on my face. My panicked, wide-eyed face, staring directly into the screen as if I were being recorded in real-time.

“Who’s doing this?” I yelled, my voice shaking with a mixture of fear and fury. My heart pounded so hard it felt like it might burst out of my chest.

And then the static returned.

Her face appeared again, sharper this time, her expression more desperate than before. Her hollow eyes seemed to pierce right through me.

“He’s here…” she said, her voice a frantic whisper. “Don’t let him in…”

My breath caught as a sound echoed through the apartment—a slow, deliberate knock at the door.

  


A chill swept through the apartment, colder than any winter wind I’d ever felt. The hairs on my arms rose as the knock at the door came again, more insistent this time. My legs felt glued to the floor, my heart thundering in my chest.

And then, without me moving a muscle, the door creaked open.

The thing that entered was not human.

It wasn’t even *alive*.

Its form was nothing but a swirling shadow, a silhouette darker than the deepest night, its edges rippling like smoke caught in an unseen current. It moved slowly, deliberately, and with each step, the room seemed to shrink, the walls pressing closer as the air grew thick and suffocating.

I tried to back away, to scream, to *do anything*, but my body betrayed me. My legs refused to move, my voice caught in my throat like a stone. All I could do was stare as the entity glided toward me, its outline shimmering like heat waves distorting reality itself.

From the TV behind me, her voice returned—urgent and frantic.

“Stop him!” she screamed.

Her voice jolted me out of my paralysis, and I turned my head just enough to see her face on the shattered screen. Her expression was one of pure desperation, her eyes pleading with me.

“Destroy it!” she yelled.

Destroy *what*? I didn’t have time to think. The entity was almost upon me, its presence crushing, like a weight pressing against my chest. My instinct took over. I grabbed the remote from the table and pointed it at the TV, frantically mashing buttons as though that would somehow make this nightmare go away.

The screen flickered violently, and for a moment, her face grew clearer.

“NOW!” she screamed, her voice almost drowning in the static.

With a primal roar of my own, I hurled the remote at the TV with every ounce of strength I had. The glass shattered on impact, a deafening crash that echoed through the apartment.

The screen went dark.

The entity froze.

Its guttural roar reverberated through the room, a sound so deep and alien that it felt like it rattled my bones. The shadowy form twisted and contorted, its edges fraying like strands of smoke caught in a gust of wind.

And then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, the entity dissolved, its inky blackness unraveling into wisps of smoke. The wisps swirled for a moment, then vanished into the air, leaving behind nothing but an eerie silence.

I collapsed to my knees, my body trembling uncontrollably. The shattered TV lay in front of me, its dark screen reflecting the chaos of the room.

The woman’s voice didn’t return.

And for the first time in what felt like an eternity, the apartment was silent again.



The morning light spilled through the blinds, but it did little to warm the cold emptiness that had taken root in the apartment. I sat there on the couch, motionless, staring at the remnants of the shattered TV. My mind was a storm of disbelief and fear, replaying the events of the night over and over.

When the police finally arrived, I must have looked like a madman.

“Are you all right, sir?” one of the officers asked, his tone cautious.

I nodded stiffly. “I... I’m fine,” I mumbled, though I knew the dark circles under my eyes and my trembling hands said otherwise.

They asked what had happened, and I tried to explain. I told them about the static, the voice, the shadow that had come through the door. But as the words spilled out, I could see the skepticism in their eyes.

“You’ve been under a lot of stress,” one officer said kindly, patting me on the shoulder. “Maybe you just need some rest.”

Rest. As if I’d ever sleep again after what I’d seen.

They turned their attention to the TV. “We can take this for disposal if you want,” the second officer offered, nodding toward the shattered mess.

“Please,” I said quickly. The thought of it staying in my apartment for even another second made my skin crawl.

They lifted the heavy, boxy frame and began carrying it toward the door. I watched them, relief mingling with lingering dread.

As they reached the hallway, one of the officers paused. He tilted his head, his expression puzzled.

“Hey,” he said to his partner. “Did you hear something?”

The other officer frowned, shaking his head. “Nah. Probably just the wind.”

But I knew better.

Even from where I sat, I could feel it—a faint, almost imperceptible whisper that seemed to come from the broken shards of glass.

“Help me...”

My stomach turned, and I clenched my fists, willing myself not to break down in front of them.

As the door closed behind them, I let out a shaky breath, the silence of the apartment returning like a heavy weight. But I knew the truth.

Somewhere out there, trapped within that shattered screen, the voice remained. And I had no idea if destroying the TV had truly stopped the nightmare—or merely set it loose.
