*I know I’ve said it before, but I need to say it again.  Your poofy hair is such a turn on.  You don’t see women with such exquisite hair these days.  You are truly special.*

I leaned back in my chair, fingers hovering above the keyboard, as my brain tried to come up with a creative response to the guy I’d been chatting with online for the past few weeks.

*Thank you darling.  As I’ve told you before also, I hope your profile pic is close to the real thing.  You are such a dream.  I’ll see you tonight around eight.*

Jasper McMillan, thirty-eight years old with a buzz cut that suited him, and a smile that that made me tingle between the legs.  I had poured countless hours into finding someone I could connect with.  And yet, my only interaction with him was online; we had not met face-to-face. 

The nerves kicked in as I pulled into his long driveway on a frigid, Friday evening.  Upon stepping out of my vehicle, my eyes darted to the side of the house, where white cellar doors rattled from the gusting wind.  There was also no sign of Jasper’s car parked anywhere.

*I’m out front.  The porch lights are off.  Are you home?*

I applied another coat of red lipstick while I waited for him to reply.

*Come on in.  Front door is unlocked.  It’s cold out there.*

It was not the first time a man had refused to greet me properly outside before welcoming me into his home.  There were plenty of bad apples with no manners.  But this time felt different.  There was an eerie vibe surrounding his house.  The lawn was overdue for a cut.  The vinyl siding was dirty, and weeds as tall as me pleaded to be pulled.

“I’m in the back room.  Keep going straight,” he said, as I stepped into his dimly lit living room.  The room reeked of hair spray and sweaty socks.  I saw Jasper in the distance waving me over.  From where I stood, his face looked fake, like someone had placed a middle-school pencil drawing of a human face over his real face.

“That hair, that really is something.  It’s nice to finally meet you in person.  Pull up a chair.”

Vomit tickled the back of my throat.  My body went numb at the sight of the man sitting ten feet in front of me.  Jasper looked nothing like his profile photo.  He was wearing a tank top and shorts, and his arms and legs were covered with hair as puffy as mine.  But it wasn’t the kind of hair you would expect to see on a man.  It looked like he had glued on women’s wigs and clumps of hair on his skin.

“I’m sorry.  I think I’m going to head out.”

“Wait!  You have to help me!” he shouted.  “I need your hair!”

Jasper’s eyes and nose slid down to his mouth, making the top half of his face look like taffy.  He reached for his chin and pulled off his face, and then proceeded to mold the chunk of flesh into the shape of a ball before tossing it across the room.

“I need your hair.  I can’t go out in public like this,” he said.

A mass of flesh stretched in my direction and latched onto my head.  As I tried to fight it and pull away, a chunk of my scalp peeled off and was sucked into the blob that Jasper had become.  I darted for the living room door as Jasper slithered behind me. 

I made it safely to my car and turned on the ignition, my heart almost bursting through my chest.  A brief moment of calm and disbelief as I tried to process what in the world I just witnessed.

“Oh my—”

The windshield became completely dark as Jasper’s skin covered it like putty.  I put the car in reverse and stepped on the gas pedal while Jasper’s body expanded to the driver and passenger-side windows.  Glass started to crack, my body on the verge of fainting.  I slammed on the brakes.

Jasper unleashed a painful roar, as he was plucked off my car by a woman who appeared to have stabbed him with hedge shears.  I watched as she flung him to the ground.  She locked eyes with me, and I knew what I had to do.

The woman moved to the side, let go of the shears, and I slammed on the pedal, running over Jasper.  He moaned but still seemed to be alive.  I got out of the car, and we both watched Jasper burrow his way into the dirt and disappear.

The woman—hairless—told me she had been kidnapped by Jasper on their first date, and that he had locked her up in the cellar.  She managed to break out and save me that night, and for that, I am forever grateful.  We don’t know what exactly Jasper is; we never saw him again.  But it scares me to think that he is still out there.
