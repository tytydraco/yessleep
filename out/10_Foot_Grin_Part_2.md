He is here. Grin is everywhere. Where there is a dark corner, I can find him lurking, staring, whispering. Even now as I type this the light doesn’t quite reach the furthest corner of the room, and I can see his eyes and sharp teeth. His entire body squeezed into a small corner. I dare not look at him directly anymore. This is what happened on the 7th day/night.



One of the unused rooms on the first floor had a light go out and put the room in partial darkness. The light from the hallway only spills partway into the room. I have to pass that room to get to the kitchen, and I just cannot stop eating. So I have been walking past the door constantly throughout the day. I have never been this hungry before in my life. 



Every time I pass the door, I can see him standing there. Just at the edge of the light. He’s made no moves toward me, and I’d believe him to be a statue if not for the fact that every time he catches me looking directly at him his grin widens ever so slightly. 



What’s even more odd is that the hallucinations are in there too, but they seem to be… keeping their distance. I know that sounds crazy. The whole thing does. But it’s so odd. I stopped once for a minute to look, really get a good look at him versus the other… less real entities. He is more defined than I thought. Grin’s skin was matte black and slick looking. Even in the darkness you could see him, darker than the rest. His arms run the entire length of his body, ending in a clawed hand that rests just inches off the ground. Feet that looked like a humans, but a bit bigger than they should be for his size. Grin’s head… Holes where his nose should be, ears that barely protruded. His eyes lacked any pupils and were just solid white. The grin. That grin that haunted me. It stretched from ear to ear, filled with jagged rows of serrated porcelain white teeth. 



The grin seemed to grow even wider as I stared at him, he leaned forward, eager for something. His eyes burrowing into mine with intent and purpose. I think that purpose is me. I realized that I had slowly been moving forward, my shadow casting into the room almost reaching Grin. I stumbled backwards against the wall of the hallway, my head pounding. I stood there for a moment collecting myself before realizing I was tired of this game. I moved towards the room, reaching into the room for the door. I watched the smile slowly disappear from Grin’s face as he rushed forward in the shadows, but I slammed the door in his face.



"SIMON!" I heard my name screamed—a deafening blast that reverberated through my skull, renewing the pounding in my head with a feverish fervor. The door slammed shut, but the screaming didn't stop. I heard his awful claws immediately begin tearing at the wood, leaving long furrows as he screamed my name again. I stumbled backwards down the hall, and ran directly into my brother, Will.



“Dude, what is going on with you? Quit slamming the doors” he said, looking genuinely concerned.



“Yeah maybe stop being a cunt” said Silas from around the kitchen island.



I just stared at them, bewildered. “You guys truly didn’t hear any of that besides the door? You can’t hear THAT?” I asked, gesturing down the hallway towards the door. But as I pointed to it, the scratching and screaming stopped.



“Never mind I guess” I sighed, after seeing the looks on their faces I didn’t bother waiting for them to reply. I walked back down the hall to the door. I gathered my courage to open the door again, thinking maybe I should just bring one of them over when I heard something strange. I could hear Grin, walking and scraping his claws against the floor… above me. Feeling slightly emboldened that he wasn’t on the first floor I opened the door. The back of the door was covered in deep claw marks, and so was the floor. 



I left the damaged door and went up the main stairs at the end of the hallway. Climbing the steps unsteadily, fueled by a terrible curiosity, I headed towards the sounds. As I walked down the 2nd floor hallway past several closed doors, the scratching stopped.



*Tap, Tap, Tap -* came from the other side of the wall.



I waited for a while in the hall and took some time to think. The best idea I came up with was maybe there was a crawl space or something on the other side of the wall. Which may well be the case but I have no idea, and that strikes me as odd. Once again, I questioned whether or not I am going insane or if this was something else.



I’m not religious, and I wouldn’t call myself spiritual in any way. I don’t believe in ghosts, demons, etc. However, I am not someone to ignore evidence that is thrown in my face. A few days ago I would have told you something like this was impossible. That anyone claiming such a thing was either lying or crazy. And now I am either in danger, or crazy. To be fair, crazy is still dangerous.



I eventually made my way back down the stairs and into my bed. As a precaution I set up a lamp in the room and turned it on, so that when my brothers drew the wall across the room and turned off the lights, there wouldn’t be darkness. After that I quickly crashed in my bed. Gonna have to get used to sleeping with the lights on until this is all over.



I was sound asleep when I heard 3 distinct taps. I ignored them and tried to go back to sleep. But they kept coming in groups of threes. Until finally a group of 7, much louder than the rest. Again I ignored them, but they began coming faster. As I awoke completely, I realized there was pressure on my chest like someone was sitting on it, and it was hard to breathe. I opened my eyes and the tapping stopped. I felt my chest and nothing was there, but the pressure persisted.



I was in a room completely barren except for some papers on the floor. No doors or windows, just 4 empty walls. The room wasn’t very big, but the ceiling was very tall. The papers on the floor caught my eye, so I reached down and grabbed one.



It was a drawing of Grin. It showed him in a dark corner of a dimly lit room. I dropped the paper on the ground and grabbed another one. It was another drawing of him, but this one had him standing up straight with claws hovering off the ground. I kept looking through the papers until I heard very soft but quick footsteps on the other side of the wall. Frozen to the spot I waited, trying to be as quiet as possible.



*Tap*. *Tap*. *Tap*. 



In horror I realized where I was in the house. On the other side of the wall in the hallway of the 2nd floor. I ran over to the wall and started pounding on it. Crying out for anyone to help me. I got no response. My breaths were coming ragged and my mind was foggy. I tried to calm down and take deep slow breaths, but I realized that weight on my chest had increased, and I could feel clawed hands on my neck, squeezing and digging into my skin, choking me. I put my hands to my neck as the room started fading. Trying to pull the hands I couldn’t see off of me.



“Simon” Grin whispered. 



I heard my name whispered over and over, and as the room completely faded I could see Grin's terrible face hover over mine, his mouth not moving as he whispered my name.



“Sim!” 



“Sim wake up! Sim!”



I felt someone’s hands pulling at mine as I slowly regained consciousness. I opened my eyes to see my brother, Will standing over me. I looked down at my chest and hand



“What are you doing?! Are you trying to kill yourself? You were choking yourself” he said tensely as he gestured to my neck. 



I pushed him off me and stumbled over to the bathroom, entering it and shutting the door. In the mirror I could see shallow gashes along my neck. I quickly opened all the drawers in the bathroom looking for gauze and bandages. Not finding any I pulled my shirt up around my neck after wiping the blood off and headed out into the kitchen. No luck there either. I rushed back into my room and tore up a shirt, taking it back into the bathroom to wrap my neck.



He is real. Grin is real. He has to be.
