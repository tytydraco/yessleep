"Hey Ace, your phon-" but he was already taking a turn around the corner, I noticed everyone's phone was buzzing. Everyone but a selected few. It was an emergency alert. My eyes froze "ATTENTION : ALL HUMANS ARE NOW FREE TO BE EATEN. PLEASE REMEMBER TO THANK YOUR LORDS", "What the fuck?" I felt a shudder. Turning my head to look at Ace. 

Ace reached for his phone, and I saw a look of fear in his eyes. "I. I am sorry", a scream erupted behind me. The whole cafeteria was in a frenzy. I saw one student's mouth open wide in an unnatural manner, turned into a maw full of razor sharp teeth they used to chomp on the student next to them. More students like that turned up eating other students.

My eyes were registering what was happening but my mind was having a hard time processing. A hand yanked me to the side "Whatever you do. Act like a predator. Act. So that you stay alive" Ace's eyes were full of sorrow, he he clasped my hand so hard I nodded. "I love you bro", gave me a reassuring smile. Before his mouth opened and changed into a maw. He grabbed a girl next to him who was wailing and bit a chunk right off the side of her face. With a sound of bone crashing from his teeth. 

Blood was spewing everywhere around me. Limbs flying in the air. I had to feel my heart beat with my hand because everything that was happening was too much for a simple human being. Ace shoved a chunk of meat into my mouth. "Chew, Grey. Chew make it look real. I don't want the others to. The others to notice that you're not one of us", I nodded chewing with tears shimmering down my face. He tossed the limp body to the side, I saw it jerk once more with strands of flesh hanging from it's neck. 

"I want you to act like you're eating. I don't care how just do it bro" he grabbed me by the neck and shoved me down. I fell to my knees, looking at those lifeless eyes I had to eat. Inhuman screams filled the air, the room became tight and tighter. The wailing and screeching vibrated my insides. I needed to survive so I did as Ace said. 

Kids scrambled to the windows, doors. Some cowering under the table. I saw Damien, from the class opposite mine. They had him on a choke hold while the other tore through his stomach with their claws. But the whole cafetiera was completely locked down. Looking around, I saw the "predators" tearing flesh off of my peers. Crunching sounds echoing through the walls. The whole ordeal lasted about 10 minutes. To me it felt like an hour. Time moved like a snail on hot gravel.

The noise died down. "Damn. That was the freshest batch of kids we've had in a while. Well done Predator Council" some girls behind me were cheering. I was shaking to the core, tears and blood covering my cheeks and chin. I did not realise I was still chewing on that piece of meat, until I gulped loudly forcing myself to swallow having the whole room to turn towards me. Eyes staring daggers at me, I was feeling suffocated. It was then I noticed they're had reptilian eyes. "Damn. Melissa tasted good huh Grey" Ace stepped forward and punched me on the shoulder.

"Grey? A predator? I didn't hear anything about that. " Tyrone stepped towards me with a grunt in his voice. His eyes bloody red. No irises in sight. "Yea. Y'all didn't know? Huh" Ace responded stepping in front of him to shield me. Someone blurted "Who cares, I saw him eat Melissa. Can we just get out of here so that cleaning crew can clean up. Gosh". The air was heavy, stifled with the smell of blood "This place is so dirty ugh" Adriana erupted from beneath a pile of bodies, licking her lips "Do you think if he wasn't a predator he'd still be alive dingus?" Tyrone clicked his tongue before walking away. A group of guys in hazmat suits walked in with cleaning supplies. As the doors clicked open. Ace took my hand and led me outside. Ears ringing, there was nothing but white noise. I was numb, my brain fried from the whole ordeal. "Hey, are you okay? Grey?", his voice sounded distant he snapped his fingers to draw my attention I jumped "Wha- what. What was that. What are you?" he craned his neck, "Are you okay?". I nodded, more than I should have "Yea, yea I think. I yea". He sighed "Well I'm not human. Those guys aren't human. About half the school isn't human. You guys were brought here to be well, to be pampered, fed, bred so that you can be fit and ready for eating. I'm sorry Grey. If-", I pushed him to the side.

"What. So you, you guys eat kids you. You bring them out here and just eat them. What kinda sick twisted fuckers are you?", I was panting. "If I didn't make you eat Melissa, you'd have died. I wouldn't have been able to help you because those guys are stronger than me. Bro. You need to understand", part of me already understood I just needed clarity. Clarity on what had just happened. "I love you bro", he put up his fist for a fist bump. "Gay, that is gay. But I love you too" I lifted up my fist and it collided with his.

I trusted him with my life. He was like a brother to me ever since I came to this school two years ago. I knew him, at least I thought I did. But he knew me, my life my secrets my favourite porn catalog even my passwords.


Two years ago I got a scholarship. From a survey, on the Internet. I know you guys think I am a fool for not noticing the red flags. Truth is, I needed an escape. Mom was hooked on her flopping OnlyFans page she got coerced to start by her junkie of a boyfriend. I had dropped out of school since well "Money issues". I stumbled upon a pop up ad "TAKE SURVEYS & WIN A PAID SCHOLARSHIP" to my surprise the questions were farely easy. Two years ago is where all this took place. That's how I ended up in another country. In the middle of nowhere, as food for the predators.
