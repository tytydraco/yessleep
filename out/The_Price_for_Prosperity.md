  
We were a family of five, living in a humble village. There was my mother and father, working tirelessly to make ends meet. My elder sister, always a source of guidance, my younger sister, the innocent soul of our home, and myself, the middle child who never quite grasped the gravity of our situation. In the beginning, our lives were seemingly ordinary, considering our lower-middle-class status. My father toiled as a daily labourer, breaking his back in the fields, while my mother spent her days scrubbing the dirt and grime off other people's dishes.  
As time passed, I began to notice my mother's presence in our home more and more. At first, it seemed like a blessing, a chance for us to bond and spend quality time together. She often had a warm smile on her face, assuring us that she simply wanted to be closer to her family. Innocently, I believed her words.   
I remember the days when she used to leave for work, clutching her tattered apron as she set out to clean the utensils in other people's homes. The clinking of coins in her pocket, the echoes of her determined footsteps, were all part of our daily rhythm. But those days slowly faded away, like a forgotten melody.   
One evening, while my father was away working, I asked her, "Mama, you've been home so much lately. Are you not going to work anymore?"  
She knelt down to my level, her eyes locking onto mine, her smile seemingly sadder now. "I just want to be with you all more, my dear," she said, her voice trembling slightly, like leaves rustling in a quiet breeze.  
As the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months, it was my elder sister who unveiled the painful truth. She pulled me aside one evening, her face etched with concern. "You know, our mother didn't choose to stay home. She was fired from her job."  
The innocence that once filled our home began to crumble, revealing the shadows that had been creeping in. I was too young to fully understand the implications of her job loss, but I could sense the unease that had settled in our household. My mother's cheerful facade was beginning to falter, and an unspoken tension hung in the air. It was only the beginning of a series of unsettling events that would plunge our family into a darkness we could never have imagined.  
As the days turned into weeks, an unforeseen shift occurred in our household. My father, a pillar of strength in our family, began to linger at home more often. For a child, this sudden change was, on the surface, a welcome one. It meant I had my father around, someone to play with, someone to teach me things and share stories. He would take me on little adventures around our village, showing me the secrets of the forest, teaching me to fly kites, and sharing his dreams and aspirations.  
I cherished these moments. His presence brought a sense of warmth and security that I had taken for granted. I saw a smile on his face, a genuine one that I hadn't seen in a long time. It appeared that he, too, was content with this newfound togetherness.  
However, the tranquil surface masked a turbulent undercurrent. Whenever my parents were alone, there were hushed conversations, sometimes escalating into angry, incomprehensible quarrels. The whispers in the night, the stifled sobs, and the sound of shattered glass seeping through the walls painted a picture of something deeply amiss. For me, it was like witnessing a storm brewing in the distance, feeling the tension in the air, yet being too young to fully comprehend its gravity.  
I'd find myself lying in my bed at night, the murmurs of my parents in the next room becoming a disconcerting lullaby. Their voices, once full of love, had grown sharp and strained. It was as if a shadow had fallen upon our family, one that I couldn't fathom, let alone articulate. The harmonious melody of our family life was gradually shifting into a discordant tune, and the innocence of my childhood was beginning to shatter, piece by piece.  
The awakening to our family's financial struggles became more evident as my requests for a bit of money to buy candy were met with reluctant "no’s. It was a tough realization. I knew we weren't wealthy like some of the other kids, but this felt like a whole new level of not having enough.  
Then came the day when we all gathered around and my father, with a sombre expression, started explaining everything. He said, "Money's become tight for us. For some reason, both your mother and I can't seem to find work right now, and it's putting a strain on our family. So, we're going to have to start saving and being more careful with our expenses."  
His words hung in the air, heavy with the weight of reality. It was a moment when childhood innocence clashed with the grown-up world, and I began to understand that our family faced challenges unlike any we had encountered before.  
For nearly a year, our family navigated the relentless grip of financial hardship. My parents, once the symbols of resilience, tried every avenue to secure work, but it seemed like an unyielding storm that wouldn't pass.   
When you're backed into a corner, when all doors seem shut, the heart often turns to a higher power. And so, in our darkest hour, we turned to God. It was a choice born out of desperation, a plea for divine intervention. Prayers became our solace, our flickering candle in the dimness of uncertainty.  
Soon, a humble priest began to visit our home. His presence, with his simple robes and kind eyes, brought a sense of hope. He would lead us in prayers, his words infused with the power of faith. In the midst of our struggles, these sacred moments offered a glimmer of solace, like a gentle breeze in a scorching desert.  
With each visit, our family found strength in unity and solace in spirituality. We clung to the belief that perhaps, through our devotion, we might find a path out of the darkness that had engulfed us. It was a time when faith illuminated our lives and allowed us to endure the most challenging of days.  
During one of the priest's visits, a chilling suggestion sent shivers down our spines. He recommended a blood sacrifice as a means to appease the unseen forces that held our family captive. The very thought was nightmarish, a concept that filled our innocent hearts with dread.  
On the fateful day, our home was filled with a palpable aura of foreboding. My parents had bought a rooster for the grim ritual. I can still feel the terror that washed over me as I witnessed the brutal act. The rooster's feathers, once vibrant, now matted with crimson, its desperate cries piercing the air. I turned my gaze away, but the haunting sounds of its demise remained etched in my memory.  
In my panic, I grabbed my younger sister, and together we sought refuge in different rooms. Our hearts raced as the sounds of the sacrifice continued to echo through the house. The priest performed a gruesome act, sprinkling the rooster's blood and shattered bones throughout our home. With an ominous proclamation, he assured us that our lives would change within a month.  
It was a moment when terror intertwined with desperation, and our family took a dark step into the unknown, clinging to the belief that this horrifying ritual might finally break the curse that had plagued us.  
As 30 agonizing days passed, the promised change remained elusive. Desperation gave way to a haunting realization that the priest's rituals might not hold the key to our salvation.   
With each failed attempt, the sacrifices grew more grotesque, a descent into a nightmare that seemed to have no end. Next, it was a goat, its cries of anguish piercing the air as it met a gruesome fate at the hands of the priest. The once-tranquil walls of our home were now stained with the horrors of blood and death.  
Yet still, nothing shifted, and our family's suffering persisted. The darkness continued to tighten its grip, and in a final desperate act, the priest led us to a calf.  
The innocence of the calf mirrored our own, and its sacrifice was a brutal reminder of the lengths we would go to break the curse that had enveloped us.  
It was a gruesome progression into a world of pain and despair, as the priest's promises began to crumble like brittle leaves in a relentless storm.  
During the next visit from the priest, something transpired that left my parents in a state of bewilderment. They refused to divulge any details to us, their children, but the furrowed brows, the hushed conversations, and the pensive looks on their faces betrayed that something ominous was afoot.  
What followed was a series of days that felt like a surreal, twisted dream. It was as if the world itself had been turned upside down. Our meals were no longer meager; they were sumptuous feasts filled with sweets and delights, a stark contrast to the simple, humble meals we had grown accustomed to. New clothes adorned our bodies, replacing the worn and threadbare ones we once wore. My young heart, in its innocence, believed that our happy days had finally dawned.  
For the next 30 days, our family lived in a world that seemed touched by magic. Whatever we wished for, we received. Toys, treats, adventures—our desires were fulfilled as if by some benevolent genie. The laughter of children filled the house, and for a brief moment, it felt like we were in a paradise.  
But this happiness was a veil, one that concealed the true source of our newfound abundance. The adults in the house wore expressions of sorrow, their eyes filled with unshed tears. They wept in silence throughout the night, their sobs resonating through the darkness.  
As a child, I couldn't grasp the complexities of the situation, but I sensed that something was terribly amiss. The strange turn of events had cast a haunting shadow over our home, a shadow that even the brightest days could not dispel. It was a time when our family's destiny took a sinister turn, and the true cost of our altered reality remained hidden from us, like a secret too dreadful to unveil.  
The pivotal day arrived, cloaked in a shroud of foreboding. The priest, now joined by two others dressed identically, seemed to hold an eerie authority over the gathering. There was a sense that he was the orchestrator of this macabre ceremony, his words carrying a sinister weight.  
We were all adorned in our new clothes, a facade of celebration masking the unsettling reality beneath. The air was heavy with the anticipation of a feast, but it wasn't the kind of feast one might expect. Instead, it was a feast of dread, a culmination of horrors lurking beneath the veneer of festivities.  
Seated by the pyre, I sensed something amiss. My parents and my youngest sister were conspicuously absent, lingering in the bedroom. It was as if they were running late, yet an inexplicable unease settled within me.   
Then, they appeared. My sister, my innocent darling, was dressed as if for a wedding, flowers adorning her head. A sense of dread began to unfurl in my heart. We gathered around the pyre, my sister seated between my parents, her presence adorned with an unnatural significance.  
As the priest commenced the prayer, the focus shifted inexorably toward my sister. My parents received items from the priest, urging her to partake. The realization began to creep into my consciousness like a creeping mist. The priest was orchestrating the same ritual with my sister that he had performed with the rooster and the goat. The grim truth began to unravel before me.  
A veil of terror descended over the gathering as the sinister nature of the ceremony became apparent. My sister, dressed as a bride, was not part of a joyous celebration but a dreadful offering in a ritual I had once witnessed in horror. The sense of horror and impending doom thickened the air, and I found myself ensnared in a nightmare with no escape.  
The prayer ended, and the chilling moment was upon us. The priest produced two ropes, and my parents, their faces etched with an eerie determination, began to bind my sister's hands and legs. Her cries of terror filled the room as she struggled against the bindings, tears streaming down her cheeks. Yet my parents, her own protectors, whispered reassurances that this was only temporary, that everything would be fine soon.   
My elder sister sobbed in sorrow, her gaze filled with a knowledge I had yet to grasp. I approached my mother, the panic in my voice clear, "What are you doing, Mom?" She forced a smile, "It's just for a few minutes, dear, and then everything will be fine." I desperately wanted to believe her, but the chilling truth was becoming impossible to ignore.  
Events unfurled with dizzying speed, too surreal to fully comprehend. My little sister's cries grew more desperate as my mother tried to comfort her. Then the priest issued a command to the other two, and they gently laid my sister down, her tears mirroring the unspoken anguish in my parents' eyes.  
In a last, futile attempt to escape this nightmarish scene, I tried to run, but their hands closed around me, drawing me back into the room. I was informed that everyone had to participate for the ritual to succeed, and my heart sank further into dread.  
There she lay, in the middle of the room, bound and helpless, her eyes filled with pleading tears, searching for hope in my parents' faces. We encircled her, holding hands, as my parents and the other two priests chanted a prayer, their voices carrying the weight of an unspeakable horror. The main priest approached, a gleaming knife in hand, and in that moment, the room became a crucible of fear and despair, a nightmarish tableau from which there seemed to be no escape.  
In a nightmarish tableau, the priest sat beside my sister, and my eyes remained transfixed in unrelenting horror. The haunting chant of the prayer intensified, and the grip on my hand tightened, preventing any futile attempt to break free. I struggled to release my hand from my parents' hold, but their determination held fast.  
The priest began to recite an incantation, and with a sense of dread that seemed to hang in the air like a storm cloud, he sprinkled water on the knife. My sister, her pleading gaze darting to our mother, found no solace in her closed eyes. In fact, as the prayer reached a crescendo, everyone else in the room had closed their eyes except for the priest, myself, and my sister.  
She locked eyes with me, a silent plea that pierced my very soul. It was as though her gaze implored, "Aren't you going to help me? Why do you just stand there, brother? Can't you save me?" Her scream of desperation began to escape her lips, but the priest, with a chilling and firm hand, silenced her, muffling her cries. Still, her eyes remained locked onto mine, beseeching me for salvation.  
The priest, his voice now a crescendo of chilling resonance, brought the knife perilously close to my sister's throat. The room fell into an eerie silence, a deafening void that echoed with our collective dread.  
In an instant, he sliced her throat, and an explosive burst of blood gushed forth, staining the room in a grotesque display of unspeakable horror. It was in that very moment when I went numb, the world blurring into a grotesque nightmare.  
The two priests, rather than rushing to her aid as I had initially hoped, grabbed pans with an unsettling efficiency, calmly collecting the blood that flowed like a malevolent river. I remained locked in my own body, my gaze fixated on my sister's lifeless eyes, which slowly glazed over as her body stilled, leaving nothing but the eerie silence of death in its wake.  
What followed was an even more nightmarish descent into the abyss, but by then, I had become a mere shell, numbed to the horrors unfolding before my eyes.  
As the blood flow ceased, the two accompanying priests calmly began to sprinkle water on the crimson pool, while the main priest brought forth a larger, more ominous knife. My parents, their faces a peculiar mixture of grief and reassurance, consoled my elder sister with promises of her being with God, in a place of eternal happiness. Meanwhile, I remained fixed in place, a silent spectator to the unspeakable.  
With a chilling calmness, the priest proceeded to undress my sister, her lifeless form a grotesque canvas on which he began to carve. He severed her head, then her arms, and then her legs, each macabre stroke slicing her into even smaller, uniform pieces.   
What came next was a sequence of horrifying rituals performed on these dismembered fragments. The priest then beckoned all of us, his eerie command leading us to my bedroom. A hole had been dug beneath my bed, a gaping maw of dread that awaited its gruesome cargo.  
We gathered around the pit of despair as I, the unwitting instrument of this malevolent act, poured the severed pieces into the gaping maw. The room was thick with the unspeakable, a silence punctuated only by the ghastly truth before us. The other two priests brought sand to fill the hole, covering my sister's remains in a sinister secret, buried beneath my bed.  
And there she lay, concealed in the darkest corner of our lives, an eternal slumber beneath the very place I would rest my head, a sinister presence that would forever haunt my dreams.  
The priest's dreadful ceremony left our home drenched in a chilling atmosphere, where the malevolent presence of the recent bloodshed lingered like a haunting specter. After sprinkling the blood across our once-humble abode, the priest and his accomplices departed, leaving us to sit in the same room where the unthinkable act had transpired just a few hours ago.  
It was a room that now held our unspoken anguish, a chilling reminder of the price we had paid in pursuit of an elusive prosperity. I spent countless nights lying next to my sister, haunted by the unspeakable horrors that had befallen our family. Sometimes, in the silence of the night, I would feel her presence beside me, as though she were reaching out from beyond the grave, seeking solace in her brother's embrace.  
Days turned into weeks, and we waited with bated breath for the promised change to manifest. We wore our new clothes, surrounded by the opulence that had suddenly come into our lives. Yet, despite the fleeting comforts, the undeniable truth remained: the prosperity we had been assured had yet to materialize. The question loomed over us like a shadow, casting doubts upon the price we had paid, leaving us to wonder whether the horrors we had endured were justified or whether they were not enough to fulfill the dark promise.  
As I sit in the same room where my sister's life was mercilessly extinguished, I find myself plagued by a gnawing worry. The uncertainty of what to do next, the haunting presence of a secret buried beneath my bed, and the lingering dread of what we had unleashed upon our family weigh heavily upon my heart. The sinister events of that night refuse to fade into the past, and the answers to our darkest questions remain as elusive as ever, casting a perpetual pall over our lives.
