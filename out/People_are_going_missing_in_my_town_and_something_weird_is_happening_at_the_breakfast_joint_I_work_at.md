The cold weather, I personally like it. My coworkers hate it, can't blame them. It's the time of the year when monsters appearing are at the highest. Hell. we had to exercise poor Sally, it took a lot tears, sweat, especially blood. All of that took place during last winter. It didn't help that Aba was fighting ( an actual fist fight), a mother over her food being cold. The fight was getting so chaotic that Sally went to go help Aba fight the bitch the moment she was freed by the demon. They ended up winning the brawl. The mother was dragged by her 4 year old son.before the both of them left, Harvard made the demon possess the mother. She ended up burning a house a week later and her son became a cult leader in the area. Fun times.

It's a new winter, same employees and all of that. Still thankful for that.

It was cold when I got there, had to wear a big fucking jacket, the ones where it had fur inside. I clock myself in, who do I see bursting through the door, fucking Aba, not that I have a problem with it, I'm cool with him.

" Hey Lincoln, how's my man doing"

" Just existing as usual Aba, kinda cold though"

" Fuck yeah man, I had to wear two sweaters instead of one"

" it's weird, it's always cold here, but it's oddly colder now, I hate it"

" Count me in maa---"

The devil herself proceeded to make her self know. somehow making a louder door boom than Aba, miss serous herself, Sally. Somehow with an even bigger fur jacket than what I had on me.

" Lincoln, Aba, possible ghost watching us, good to see ya made here it one piece"

" Somehow, I feel I'm looking into the eyes of a demon, or that's just your sleepy eyes doing their thing" , Aba said.

" Now, now, let's not talk about my lustrous eyes, we got some work to do"

" I just got here, the place starts in 1 hour, I don't want to work now"

" Yet we do, you know how the boss gets"

Eventually Harvard came as well, thus completing the four horseman of the apocalypse. It was 9:00, somehow even more cloudy, yet still life outside. We saw old people walking, kids running towards or away from school, even some animals here and there. finally, the first customer comes in and I'm the one who takes his order.

" what would you like for your meal to be sir"

" Just give me the classic please"

More people start to come in, some look more dead than the others. Even saw a few teens in the place. For the most part, they look liked they escaped their prison and suck refugee in this place. Eventually some guy walk into this place. He looked, how do I say this, out of place. The best way to describe it is a child who did something and is trying to hide it from their parents. I asked him if he wanted to order anything but he just said " No young man" and went to go sit in a corner. For the entire day. We tried to not pay any attention and focused on the rest buying food.

It was finally the end of the day, only one customer left, that eerie man. Sally said she had to do something in register, Harvard was cleaning the tables, Aba was in the kitchen, it was just me and this, guy. I noticed something, odd about his face the further I reach him. His eyes are red, the dark circles being worse than last time I saw him. His smile too, it looked so doll like, a forced smile you make when you take a photo. Yet the one thing that freaked me out the most was his fingers. Those fingers, they were freakish, almost disgusting. He just stood there, not moving a bit.

"Hey man, this place is about to close, time to wrap it up"

" What, I don't know what you mean by that"

" If I didn't made my myself clear, time to get out my guy"

" But I wan't to eat, I'm *really* hungry"

Loud banging was coming from the other end of the room, it was Harvard. The hell was he doing and why the hell was he banging on the bathroom door?

" Hey kid, where about to close, get the hell out", said Harvard.

" Hey man, the hell going on over there"

" Some little shit rushed into the building and sprinted towards the bathroom, I tried to stop him but he was slippery, like actually"

" guess I'm not the only one dealing this someone"

The eerie man suddenly jump out of his seat and bolted towards the kitchen, on all fours! A loud scream was coming out of the bathroom. It was blood curdling, making Sally drop all of the money she was counting.  A " The fuck"  came from the kitchen, fucking Aba, the fool was stuck with the man. Sally look like she was trying to figure out what to do, Harvard was now holding something in the bathroom, something dangerous and god knows what Aba was doing in there with the man.

Then, fucking Aba came out with the man, who knows looks like a fucking demon, right behind him. Aba bursted through the door and ran into the dark, with the monster behind him. The screams from the bathroom now faded, with a banging coming from the vents. Eventually those banging ending at a point that lead to outside. Sally was now with Harvard, trying to help him figure out what just happened. I was now just sitting, I could feel the cold wind blow inside the building, with a loud running growing louder and louder.

Mother loving Aba, he jumped into the building, Harvard immediately closing the door, Sally finally using her brain and got out the gun we had in the back. A " The fuck" was spoken from all four of us, it was the beast. The thing didn't have a face, it's nose freakishly long, and it's fingers. Oh it's fingers. Now long sticks with its muscles fully exposed. The thing just, watched us, or I think it was us. It didn't have eyes but it followed its head everywhere we walked. somehow it knew where we were despite it not having any way to see us.

Eventually, the thing just, walked away. That't it. we all just look at each other. Sally had a face you would give to someone after making an impossible request, Harvard look, tense is the best way to describe it. Aba just looked tired and me, well, I didn't have a good response to the whole thing.

" I swear to god, were always dealing with some magical, wizard bullshit" yelled Sally.

" And to think we lasted this long too" said Harvard.

After cooling off for a bit, we continued with the rest. We cleaned, prepared everything for tomorrow, clocked out, we finished. Everyone at the end looked like they wanted to bust out the good old sleeping bag and call it for the day in the breakfast joint, not that we haven't done that already. But sally was talking about her sweat bed the entire day and Aba had a dog to go to. I just wanted to sleep in an amazing bed as well, but from the looks of it, no one didn't want to walk. All except Harvard ?

" The hell are YA all staring at" Harvard said to us.

" I don't know man, you got yourself a pretty nice car and oh, what do I see, four seats, that's sexy" Aba said.

" Yeah Harvard, it would be a shame it those seats were to be wasted, but that just me though" Sally put her hands on his shoulder.

"Says the one with a gun, you probably have a better chance out there than me"

" The fuck does that have to do with all of this!"

Everyone just started to fight as they usually do. Harvard aggressively  waving his hands as he tried to explain why are fatasses shouldn't be on his car. Sally already pointing the gun at him while Aba went to go get something to help Sally with the fight. Kinda worried that they didn't noticed the skinny man. I just stood from afar, you could barely even see him. Covered by the wet fog outside, just barely visible in the blue night. He now had all his cloths off, really was skinny to the bone.

He ran into the night, probably went to find food somewhere else. At least I know he's in this town now. Next thing I know I was in a car with three loud people talking about the ways they could've killed the thing. But if they were to ever be in that situation, probably not. Sally in a not shocking way, took the gun from the job and now hat it next to her. From the looks of it, she had the safety off so homegirl was ready to shoot off someone's head off. couldn't tell you what Aba was thinking and Harvard just wanted to go home.

Aba ever so kindly turned the radio on. He switched and switched again but couldn't find a good station to play. We ended up just playing the late night one that everyone in this town listens to. He talked about story and shit. But then he stop and started talking to this guy about the recent events in the town. The pair talked about more people coming in and how they're is now a developing night life in this place but then transitioned to more disturbing news. Apparently there's a rise in people going missing, and they all seem to happen in the night. Sally forced the radio to turn off and we just all sat in silence.

"Did any of Ya see Jacob, haven't seen him pull up at work lately" Ask Harvard

" Wish I could say I did man" Aba leaned against his sear more.

" I'm sure he has a reason" Sally gripped the gun tighter.

" He did texted me that he was going to meat someone at some bar" I said .

" Did he say what time he was going" everyone looked at me.

" Around 11:00 he said"

" huh"

Eventually Sally was dropped off with Aba being next and finally me. Gave Harvard the cleanest handshake I'll ever give someone and went off to my apartment. It felt weirdly off though, like there was no noice at all. Not that I'm complaining, I like the peace, but you would expect to at least hear a bug calling. I don't know.

It felt, nice. My place isn't the most decorated but it's home. I saw a pair of shoes by the door, Emma must've been home. I go to my room and who do I see, sleep Emma, only thing I could see is her brown hair, god I love her. I go to the kitchen and, still silent. Huh.  Then I heard a shuffle, it was my golden pottos. Why the hell are they--- oh, find out. I guess Emma forgot the close the window. I closed it half way when I saw scratch marks, it covered the entire window. I closed the other window, same thing. Hell, Everysingle window had marks on them. The hell happened. Well, whatever it was, all the windows are closed, so it can't get inside now. I hope so anyways.

I look across my living room to see, oddly enough, my trash. It was stuffed. Don't know why, but some madness told me to trow it now. There was no part in my brain to counter saying " throw it in the morning man". Just this one night, with scratch marks on everyone window, my brain told me to throw that fat fucking trash. Next thing I know, I was in the alleyway next to my apartment complex. Yet no fucking noise, it's really getting to me now. I don't think I even put the trash in the dumpster, I just threw it at the direction of the dumpster. I just wanted to get out of there. It was cold, and dark, and quit. It was dead silent, there was no cars driving by, no one walking by, from the looks of it, I was the only one on earth.

Oh well, I should probably just ignore it. Then shockingly, the sound of something small hitting the ground echoed throughout the alleyway. I look around to find nothing, there was nothing? Then another small object falling from the sky. Then another, and another. The thumps filling in the void of silence that was here and I did not enjoy it. I finally decided to look up, to at least see where was these things coming from. And I didn't expect to see what I saw. It was, a man? It wasn't the skinny man from earlier, that was most certain. This one was most different. It had definition to this body, pale skin that didn't reflect to any light. But its face, it was open? Like it didn't have a face, at all. It had a head, but a face,I don't know. The place where it should have a face now was a hole and the rest of the head spreader out. Yet it looked like it was looking at me. We just had this starring contest for a while, it felt like a long time though. Started to walk away slightly but I looked like it knew what I was trying to do.

All of a sudden, the thing brutally fell to the ground, I started running, it was already half way to me. He had a giant hole in his stomach, claws sharp as nails and was ready to cut into me. I made it to the door and slam it at its face. I lock it and just, fall. It all happened so fast, it was about to get me. A claw bursted through the door, it's hands wide and ready and bolted at my face. It stopped, it was about 2 inches away from my face, still as a statue. I could hear the things breathing, it was slow and heavy, sound almost dear like. I just sat there, it felt like hours of sitting. My eyelids weirdly start to feel heavy, as if it was being weighed down my all of my sins. I fight it but that proved useless. My eyes eventually go black, and all I could hear, is the beast of the night.
