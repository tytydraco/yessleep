I (17 M) have been looking for a job for a while now, with little to no luck. My parents have been nagging me about it so I decided to go for a job at my towns local church. It’s a small town so I had a friend (17 F) who had a relative (39 F) that worked their. For the story we’re gonna call her Jen. My friend, who we’ll call Ruby, set up a meeting for me and Jen to check me out for the job. As soon as I got to the meeting place at 8:00, a little park closed off from the rest of the town, I felt uneasy. Almost like someone was watching me. I waited there for about an hour, and it was now 9:00, it was dark out and I felt uneasy. Just as I was about to leave I saw Jen standing next to my car. I yelled over at her asking her what took her so long. And before she responded I noticed that she was fully nude, and seemed to be bleeding from every orifice in her body. I gagged, and threw up in my mouth, as she opened her arms to me and began walking towards me. She started off calm, saying low under her breath
“My body is for the prophet.” While stepping towards me slowly. But as she realized I was scared, terrified for my life, she got more aggressive, yelling eventually, while sprinting towards me.
“MY BODY IS FOR THE PROPHET.” I regained control of the shock rushing through my body, before running as fast as I to my car, she was in the way but in my shock I shoulder checked her, sending her hurdling towards the ground. I busted into my car and drove off, she chased me for about a mile into town, yelling nonsense about her body being for the prophet, before she was hit by a taxi cab, and was left unconscious being cared for by some poor driver.

When I got home I couldn’t sleep, I didn’t tell anyone about what happened, and Ruby still acts normal around me. I don’t know what happened that night, but since then, I’ve been seeing things, terrible images of myself in great detail having my entire body mangled and malformed, like that old movie Tetsuo the iron man. And in between their are always a flashes of Jen, I’ve been seeing Jen everywhere now. For example, in class I was helping this girl (18) who we’ll call Tammy with her homework, for some background Tammy is very attractive and to be fair I think I really could get with her if I tried but it’s a whole mixture of me being too anxiety ridden and like my acne and stuff it’s really not anything with my personality but whatever not the point. The point is while I was helping her, I zoned out and looked out the window and I swear I saw her. I saw Jen, she was flaunting her body at me again, her disgusting, bloody body. And I guess without knowing in class I started crying my eyes out and bleeding from my nose because when I got back to my senses Tammy was worried sick and grabbing the school nurse. When I got home that day my parents asked me what was wrong and it was like my body forced me to say a simple
“Nothing.” And go up to my room. As soon as I got to my room I saw Jen, she was lying in my bed, but she looked more rotted now, more decrepit, and now there was a large mole like secretion on her back. It had ruby’s face. I’ve been seeing things like that for a while now, it’s starting to interfere with my personal life and my academic life. If anyone knows what I could be suffering from. Please let me know. I don’t wanna become some homeless schizophrenic.
