Please see to it that this story is spread to the world. It is imperative that the world knows about what I uncovered last evening. The mysteries that I uncovered several nights ago are unparalleled in the archeological world; however, I cannot reveal my name or publish this in a formal manner for fear of being ridiculed for the absurdity and outlandishness of this find. However, what I witnessed that day was real as real as the blood coursing through my veins and the heart pumping it. I haven’t gotten a wink of sleep since my encounter with that thing. I am still unsure of what that discovery was, but whatever it was, it was not like anything that has ever been observed in the natural world or explained by science to date. That thing, whatever it was, one thing is for certain it was evil incarnate. That is the only conclusion I could draw from my scrape with that demon.

My expedition began with my research into the local native american tribes in the area. I  desired to learn more about the secrets they held about their homeland that we haven’t yet uncovered. So I began surveying land that was especially significant to the nearby tribes. Through these means I found my way to a wooded area. The trees in the area had carvings etched in their trunks. The carvings had no significance to me; however, I figured that the symbols would have meaning to someone. So I would take the photographs of them to a tribal leader in the area, and he would give me insight into the meanings of the carvings. This would lead me to a prairie near the Sawtooth Mountains, where I would find the skull of a Pronghorn Antelope. I did not take too much notice, though, as Pronghorns could be found all throughout the valley. However, I would soon find out that this skull was foreboding something of a great magnitude.

The skulls became more and more prevalent, but I still paid no mind to their presence, at least not until I came across a collection of them neatly formed into a circle. I was slightly startled by this discovery but I simply assumed that the circle was either done by the local tribes that used the circle for prayer, or it was the work of some kids that found the Pronghorn skulls  and thought it’d be funny to prank someone by forming them into this ritualistic circle. These logical deductions put my heart at ease, but that ease was short-lived as a herd of Pronghorns appeared and began to surround me. I had never seen so many of them in one place before. They circled, one group on the inside moving in a counterclockwise bearing, and one group on the outside moving in a clockwise bearing. This was startling to say the least, but the horror had just begun.

By this point I had realized that I had gotten too close to the skulls and had stepped into the center of them. Far off, chanting rang out from the aether, embers began to form in the hollow eyes of the skulls as well as at the feet of the Pronghorns. The chanting got louder and louder until it was so loud, it was head-splitting. As the chanting got louder, the embers turned to inferno and from inferno to hellflame. The flames were unlike any I had seen before– a deep purple mixed with sunken black formed into a wicked netherworld. Spires of flame rose from the feet of the Pronghorns so high I couldn’t see the mountain peaks. The flames from the skulls began to pool into the middle of the ring forming a bottomless pit, and out from that pit came a wretched fiend from the darkest void. Standing at seven feet tall and wearing a Pronghorn skull over his head, this fiend was clad in furs of various animals along with the skulls of small critters like birds and rodents hanging off its body. Nothing was more terrifying than the look in the demon's eyes, though. A piercing ardent gaze looked at me as if it was thrilled to finally have prey to hunt. It pulled up from the pit a spear made from what appeared to be a human bone sharpened and attached to a long pole adorned with feathers and skulls.

The beast lunged at me with such veracity that it just narrowly missed me; however, the flames that it spewed out didn’t and set my side ablaze. The pain from the flames made my instincts kick in and  I began to run for my life. I ran through the walls of flame while I was being hit by the Pronghorns. I was being burned by the flames but if it was my one chance to escape with my life. I ran as fast as I could, not even stopping to catch my breath. I ran with the beast shadowing my every move, its spear at me narrowly missing me every time I knew that if I stopped for even a second that spear would not miss. I ran till I came across a building it was the lodge that I had been to before my exploration into the prairie I bust through the door screaming for help yelling about the beast following me the man working the counter was visibly confused as one would be if a man came bursting through the front door of your work yelling about how he was being chased by a demon he looked outside gun in hand and what he said chilled me to my very core “sir there isn’t anything out there, are you feeling okay?” it was gone.

After arming myself with a rifle I went back to the place where I first encountered the beast back to the circle of skulls to see if what I saw was even real and nothing not even scorch marks in the sagebrush I stepped into the circle just like before but nothing happened I moved the skulls but still nothing happened I started to question if any of what I saw happened that was until I lifted one of the skulls and looked into its eyes and a voice rang out from the deepest pits of Tophet in a deep groaning voice “The hunt isn’t over until the prey is caught” in words that I couldn’t comprehend but the meaning found its way into my head all the same. This startled me to my very soul causing me to drop both the skull and my gun. The darkness of night began to close in as I began to head back to the main road I looked back a mistake I with never forget I saw it the beast standing there in the circle of skulls looking at his face made me remember something the tribal leader I spoke with said “When on this hunt for knowledge you may encounter things beyond your understanding, when you find these things be sure to not approach them with the usual cavalier attitude you foolish white archaeologist have and be sure that if you come across something of that nature respect it or you may become the prey.” until that moment I had forgotten his warning and paid no heed to it and I found myself right in the crosshairs of it. I returned home soon after.

I haven't seen the beast since that day except for the terrors in my waking dreams. I am writing this in worry for that this knowledge may be lost as I fear I will not be able to pass this intel on as the words spoke to me that day in that prairie hex me to this day and I can sense the approach of the beast I know that the hunt will never end until I am caught I fear that not even death could save me from that fact. If you are reading this I can only assume that I have been caught by the ghost of the prairie and my life has been cut short and if that is the case than pass this message onto the world in this world there is things that cannot be explained by natural science things that lay in wait for some curious little cat to happen upon it and take it into its foul jaws. And finally a message for my family I am sorry for leaving you this way in my pursuit of the knowledge of the vast universe to my wife I love you with all my heart and to my children I am sorry I couldn’t see you grow into adults of you own but even still I love you to the ends of the earth and I will for the rest of time. 

If you have found this passage please make sure these messages to the people that they are meant for it is imperative that this task is completed as for my body if it is found please place it in the ring of skulls as a sacrifice to please the pale deer then maybe they will be put at ease for that little bit longer and whatever you do please do not anger the beasts that lies in wait just behind the veil that conceal the things that are just outside of all human understanding. Please fulfill these requests as this is my final will.
