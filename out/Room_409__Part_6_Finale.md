This is the last part.

Or maybe it isn’t.

Maybe it never even started.

I’ve been thinking about how easy it is to make a place real.

All that is needed are the right words and someone willing to believe in them.

You’ve been here long enough to know what the room is capable of.

What if this place only exists because you read it?

That’s the problem with stories like this.

The more you believe, the closer it gets to full power.

And belief is a door you can’t close.

———————

I walked through the door to find myself…outside? 

I was standing on the cracked sidewalk across the street from the Lotus Hotel. 

It looked the same as when I had first entered it all that time ago.

It was like it hadn’t aged—only waited.

Held in place by memory, not time.

I stood in the parking lot, staring up at the fourth floor.

Room 409.

The neon buzzed and flickered overhead softly. 

The “T” was gone, burned out completely.

Now it read:

LO US HOTEL.

Lose yourself here?

Or maybe: Lose us here.

I stepped forward, the front doors groaning as I walked inside.

The smell hit me first — not the faint perfume from before, but something heavier. Stale flowers. Disinfectant. The kind that clings to the halls of hospitals.

There was no clerk, no guests, and no music.

Just hallway after hallway—all leading to the same door.

The elevator had no buttons, just a heartbeat.

Mine? 

Maybe…

The doors to the elevator opened as I approached, as if anticipating my arrival.

They delivered me with no resistance, no fanfare.

Only a soft chime, like a heart monitor resigning to silence.

The fourth floor waited eagerly.

Room 409 sat at the end like a final sentence.

The numberplate gleamed pristinely. Not a scratch to be had.

Even the building knew that this was the last page as I walked towards it.

I placed my hand on the door.

I didn’t tremble. I had no fear, only a sense of finality.

“I brought all of me this time.”

———————

The lock didn’t click; it exhaled…and opened.

Inside, the room hadn’t changed at all.

A bed. A desk. A mirror.

But it felt… emptied.

Not like it were hollowed or haunted, but rather cleansed.

There were no more illusions or versions of me waiting in the corners with blame on their lips.

Just the lingering quiet that filled the room and my conscience.

The kind that follows a final scream.

Then the lights flickered.

Once. 

Twice.

And that’s when he stepped out of the corner.

Myself. The me I’d left behind.

The one who first entered this place and never really left.

He looked tired, worn, but not broken.

Whole.

“I waited,” he spoke, fingers twitching like he was holding back words.

After a moment’s hesitation, I replied. “I know,”

He sat on the bed; shoulders curled inward like memory trying to disappear.

“You moved on.”

“No, I tried. I buried you. I pretended you weren’t still here…but I wasn’t whole without you.”

He nodded solemnly. “It hurt. Being here alone.”

I knelt.

Not to grieve, but to witness.

“I didn’t know how to carry you, or her. I left you behind to hold the pain for both of us.”

His eyes lifted slowly until they connected with mine.

“She still visits. Not really her, just the memory. The room keeps her here too.”

“I know,” I cut myself short as I watched him reach into his pocket.

He pulled out the bracelet.

The one from the hospital bag.
The one with the missing bead.
The one I thought I’d imagined.

He placed it in my palm and closed my hand around it.

It was heavier than it should’ve been, but it was the weight of truth I had been neglectful of.

The grief didn’t scream anymore. It just sat beside me.

“I remember now.” I spoke softly, letting the words resonate like an epiphany.

“You never forgot, you just didn’t know how to remember without breaking.”

I clutched it to my chest.

The truth hit like cold water. I wasn’t here investigating. I wasn’t here chasing a lead. 

I was hiding.

And that’s when I saw it again.

The memory.

Clear as day this time.

———————

We were in the hospital room.

Claire held one of Emily’s hands while I held the other.

Claire had been crying for hours. Still, she forced a smile as the machines beeped in a heartless rhythm.

She looked so small in that bed.

She was so still and quiet. She wasn’t the little girl I had watched grow up.

Dr. Marla stood near the door, clipboard in hand.

Her eyes heavy with the kind of exhaustion that comes from telling too many families the same terrible truth.

She asked us gently if we were ready.

I remember Claire’s voice cracking, saying, “She asked you to listen if it ever came to this.”

I remember nodding but not because I was ready—but because she was.

I leaned over and whispered something in Emily’s ear.

Something I’ll never repeat aloud or in writing.

I kissed her forehead, trying desperately to retain what warmth still existed on my lips.

And then I uttered the six words that will forever shatter my heart when I think about them—

“I understand. You can rest now.”

As the doctor turned off the machine, Emily’s head tilted—eyes bright with a knowing sadness.

The ensuing flatline and Claire’s sobs filled the room in sweeping anguish.

And all I could do was sit in that chair and break in silence.

———————

Back in the room, I opened my eyes to see the other version of me still standing in front of me.

He smiled, but not the ones I was accustomed to from the reflections in the mirror. 

A real, genuine one.

It was one that revealed relief and gratitude. 

He stood and made his way to the door but paused at the doorway to turn to me for one last time.

“Thank you for coming back.”

And then…he dissipated into thin air.

That’s when Room 409 began to change.

The mirror cracked into a slow, web-like fracture, like the room itself was taking its final breaths.

Every object flickered violently as the objects of the room began to copy, duplicate, and multiply.

Two beds. Two chairs. Two journals.

The story I had been telling myself all this time…and the one that was real—colliding.

The room was trying to overwrite itself.

Fiction frayed at the edges as the walls pulsed, and the lights strobed unpredictably.

It felt as though the whole building was coming undone in real time.

And I knew—this was the moment she’d been asking for.

I went towards the desk and opened the journal that rested on its surface.

It wasn’t blank.
Not anymore.

The pages were filled.

All of them had been written by my own hand.

It wasn’t the detective’s story.

There were no more lies.

Only the truth…and her story.

The one we started together.

I turned to the last page.

Emptiness.

This was the story we never finished, until now.

That’s when I began to write.

The words that poured out of me were not works of fiction or fantasy. 

They only consisted of the truth.

“She was brave, kind and loved elephants, stories, and terrible knock-knock jokes.”

I watched a teardrop fall and hit the page, the moisture softening the words like a final hug I never got to give her.

“She asked me not to save her. I thought I was doing the right thing by having the machine be unplugged. She asked me to finish this, and I couldn’t then…but I can now.”

The room rumbled and rocked like a victim to an earthquake.

Dust drifted from the ceiling as the mirror caved in on itself.

The wallpaper peeled back to reveal bare beams and an endless sky.

And then, there she was.

She wasn’t a ghost, an apparition, or a vision.

She was herself before everything that happened…

Smiling, soft, radiant.

Real.

“You did it, Dad.” Her voice echoed, reverberating within my whole body.

The walls vanished and the light expanded to reveal a return of warmth I hadn’t felt in years.

———————

That’s when I felt myself become awake.

I was back in my apartment.

The journal sat on the table. Open to the last page. My handwriting — shaky, uneven — filled the lines.

I was no longer in Room 409.

I flipped through the journal; past every page of fiction it contained. 

Every room and every red herring.

No more.

With clear hands, I wrote:

Room 409 was never an investigation. 

It was a grave I built for Emily, brick by brick, so I could keep her close without admitting she was gone. 

Every clue, every scrap of evidence, was just another excuse to talk to her when no one else could hear.

The truth is, I didn’t want answers. 

I wanted her. 

But the room kept changing.

Pieces of me got lost inside its architecture. 

Until I saw him — the other me.

He allowed me to relive that memory, the last time I was ever with Emily.

He gave me the strength to free myself from the burdens of my lies. 

The ones that kept me in Room 409.

I’m going to post this where people can read my experiences and come to their own conclusions.

In places where people can ask, “Is this real?” and I can pretend the answer is “no.”

I’m not writing this to confess, but because it’s the only way I know how to say goodbye. 

And because I hope you will remember Emily too.

Memories may hold us, but they don’t have to keep us.
