It began quietly, as such stories often do. Mr. Mahajan, a halwai at the local sweet shop, started murmuring about sleepless nights over his tea. His words were dismissed as the ramblings of old age until Mrs. Khurana, the usually serene librarian, confessed she hadn't slept in three days. Soon, the insomnia spread like a contagion through Kungrat, a creeping malaise that defied explanation.

"Doctor Sahib, I hear her every night."

Meera, an elderly woman with deep-set eyes and trembling hands, sits across your desk. Her voice quivered as she spoke, her thick accent wrapping around her words with a shroud.

"The lullaby... the weeping. It's a mother's cry for her lost child. I can't bear it anymore."

You nod, scribbling notes even as your mind wavers with exhaustion. "Have you tried the sedatives I gave you, Meera?"

She ignored the question. Her eyes grew wide with a mix of fear and desperation as she leaned closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. "The lullaby, doctor... it's not just a song. It's haunting. It starts softly, like a whisper in the wind, a melody so gentle it almost lulls me to sleep. But then... then it changes. The notes twist into something sorrowful, filled with pain. It's as if I can feel my heart breaking with each word."

She paused, her hands trembling more violently now. "And the weeping... oh, the weeping. It's not just crying; it's a wail that pierces the silence of the night, echoing through the walls. It sounds like a mother mourning her lost child—a cry so full of anguish it makes my blood run cold. I can hear her footsteps too, pacing and searching. Every night, it gets closer."

Your pen stilled on the paper, andwas still your heartbeat quickening. "Meera, do you recognize the lullaby? Is it something you've heard before?"

She shook her head, tears welling in her eyes. "No, doctor sahib. It's unlike any song I've ever known. It's ancient and otherworldly. Sometimes, I think I can hear words, but they're in a language I don't understand. And the child... I can almost see her, reaching out, lost in the shadows."

Her cries now remind you of when she lost her grandchild not too long ago. Was her insomnia manifesting her nightmares?

Meera's voice broke, and she covered her face with her hands. "I can't take it anymore. The nights are endless, and the fear... it's consuming me. Please, doctor, you have to help me. I feel like I'm losing my mind."

You feel a chill run down your spine as you listen to her. This was more than just a figment of an overactive imagination. There was something deeply unsettling about her story—something that tugged at the edges of your rational mind.

"Your father, bless his soul, used to work wonders. But your medicines—they don't work," she whispered. "Nothing works. Maybe it's our punishment for what happened in the village."

You stiffen but keep your face neutral. The tragedy that had struck Kungrat years ago was a wound that never healed, but you refuse to believe it could cause this collective madness.

Next came Ravi, a farmer with calloused hands and the same hollow eyes.

"I see them, Doctor. Demons. Every night. They wait for me to close my eyes."

Your grip tightens around your pen as you study his weathered face, a map of the burdens he carried. "Tell me more about these demons, Ravi. What do they look like?"

His voice trembled, his eyes darting to the corners of the room as if expecting the demons to emerge at any moment. "They have skin like burnt leather, cracked and oozing. Their eyes are deep pits of darkness, and their teeth... their teeth are like broken glass. When they smile, it's not a smile at all, but a grimace of hunger and malice."

You shudder inwardly, but keep your expression calm. "And these whispers you mentioned. What do they say?"

He swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bobbing. "They tell me things, Doctor. Horrible things. They whisper my deepest fears and my darkest secrets. They know everything about me—my guilt, my regrets. They taunt me, saying I'll never escape and that they'll drag me to their world, where suffering never ends."

Dread flickers in your eyes, but you force a mask of concern. "Can you describe these whispers a little more? Are they voices you recognize?"

A tremor ran through his body, as if skneeledummoned by the question. His gaze darted around the room once more, landing on a shadowy corner behind your desk. His pupils dilated, his breath catching in his throat. A choked sound escaped his lips.

"Doctor," he rasped, his voice barely a whisper, "they're... they're here."

You slowly turn in your chair, trying to appear nonchalant. You see nothing out of the ordinary in the corner, just the familiar stacks of medical files and the old, dusty gramophone gathering cobwebs in the dim light.

"Here?" you ask gently. "What do you mean?"

But Ravi wasn't looking at you anymore. His eyes were fixed on that empty corner, his face contorted in a mixture of terror and something akin to pleading.

"Don't listen to them, Doctor," he whimpered, his voice breaking. "They're lying. They want to take me away."

You wipe the sweat from your brow. Despite the logical part of your brain screaming that this was all in Ravi's head, a primal fear gnaws at you. The raw terror in his voice was undeniable, and the way his eyes darted around the room, tracking unseen things, sent shivers down your spine.

"Ravi," you say firmly, forcing your voice to remain steady. "There's nothing here. You're safe. Tell me more about these whispers-"

A bloodcurdling scream that tore from Ravi's throat cut your words short. The farmer clawed at his ears, his face contorted in unimaginable pain.

"They're lying!" he shrieked. "I didn't do it!"

You lunged forward, your chair toppling over with a crash. You grab his shoulders, trying to ground him, to pull him back from the brink of whatever horrifying vision he was experiencing.

"Ravi, look at me!" you commanded, your voice laced with a newfound urgency. "Focus on my voice. There's nothing here. You're safe."

You barely had time to console Ravi before Vidya, a young mother, burst into the room, her eyes wide with terror. "It's God punishing us! He's come to judge us for our sins. We didn't deliver swift judgments, but now he'll deliver us."

Your heart pounded as you listened to the barrage of tormented souls, each story more harrowing than the last. You handed out prescriptions that weren't working, offered reassurances you didn't believe, and sent them back into the night. Finally, the last patient for the day entered. The local constable, Rajesh, his uniform looking as tired and worn as the man himself. You greet him with a nod and a tired smile.

"Rajesh, come in. How are you holding up? How's Veena?" you asked, motioning for him to sink into a chair.

He collapsed onto the seat with a groan that spoke volumes. "Not well, not well at all. This sleeplessness... It's crushing me and her. I haven't been able to string together a full night's rest in what feels like forever."

You lean forward, your brow furrowing with concern. "What's been plaguing your sleep, Rajesh? Nightmares? Restlessness?"

He opened his mouth to speak, but his voice hitched, replaced by a shudder that ran through his entire body. "It's not nightmares," he finally managed, his voice barely a whisper. "It's... it's like my body betrays me." He closed his eyes, his face etched with a mixture of fear and frustration.

"Can you elaborate?" you prompted gently, your pen poised over your notepad.

He took a shaky breath. "The moment I want to sleep, it starts. A suffocating pressure clamps down on my chest, squeezing the air from my lungs. It feels like someone has wrapped me in an iron cocoon, stealing my ability to move a single muscle." He fisted his hands, the effort trembling in his voice. "I'm trapped. Completely paralyzed. I can hear my own ragged breaths echoing in the darkness, but I can't call out, can't fight back. All I can do is lie there, prisoner in my own body, until the terror drags me back to consciousness."

You feel a cold shiver crawl down your spine. This was far worse than simple insomnia. "Rajesh," you say, your voice grave, "you're not alone in this. Meera, Ravi, and many others have described similar experiences. There's something... something unsettling at work in Kungrat, and it seems to affect all of us."

"What about you? How're you holding up?"

"I can't think of anything other than my patients and their nightmares while I lay in bed. I can't help but think my father would've done a better job to calm and help the people."

"Hey, this clinic is right now the only sanctuary for the people out there, and you made it happen. I am sure your father would be proud. He wouldn't want you to get so caught up in work that you forget to find someone to weather the storm with."

A weak chuckle escaped him as he nudged me with his elbow. "Yeah, well, maybe then you'll finally understand the other meaning of a sleepless night, huh?" His voice lacked its usual spark, his eyes a little dull.

"I'll look into that after this, alright." You let out a chuckle yourself, enjoying a hopeful moment.

Rajesh covered his face and let out a deep sigh. "I don't know what to think. Everyone in town's got a different story, and each one sounds crazier than the last. Some folks whisper about a curse, a darkness choking the life out of Kungrat. Others blame vengeful forest spirits, stirred up by... well, you know." He cast a nervous glance around, his voice dropping to a hushed tone. "Then there's the whole alien conspiracy brewing down by the old radio tower. Demons, ghosts, space invaders—everyone's got their own theory, but none of them sound any more likely than the next."

"What do you think it is?"

"The forest. Believe it or not, all our problems started that day. We should've done something sooner."

"Don't tell me you believe in those stories, too. What happened that day has nothing to do with this. As for the forest, if anything, it has kept people safe. People are dying to get out of this town, thinking it will cure their insomnia. But they are too afraid of venturing into it."

Rajesh didn't seem convinced, but kept it to himself.

"Any news about the road?" You ask, "Is the government rebuilding it?"

"While the monsoon gods keep punishing us, not a chance. And about the people who tried to escape, we have heard no news whether they found a way to the other side."

You nod, understanding the gravity of the situation. Kungrat was a small town nestled in the heart of Himachal Pradesh. Surrounded by dense forests and treacherous terrain, it was a place where the modern world rarely ventured.

"With no connection to the outside world, we're isolated, and the fear is growing. I don't know how long the people can hold up."

"Do you have any theories?" Rajesh asked, "You're the only person who has listened to every cry of people. Anything common between their nightmares?"

You lean back, your mind racing. "There's something here, something ancient and powerful. The town's isolation has awakened something, and it's affecting all of us. But there has to be a way to fight it, to understand it."

Rajesh nodded slowly, the fear in his eyes tempered by a glimmer of hope. "We've always relied on the old ways, the traditions and rituals that have protected us for generations. Maybe we need to look at them now to find answers in the past."

Your thoughts drift to the old texts and the stories your grandparents used to tell you. There were secrets in those tales—hints of knowledge that could help now. "I think you're right, Rajesh. We need to dig deeper to understand the lore of Kungrat and find a way to protect ourselves."

As you two sat in the dimly lit office, the weight of the task settled. The town was in danger, its people gripped by a fear that threatened to consume them.

The clock struck midnight. After a bid goodbye, you made your way through the streets of Kungrat. Even the moon had a dimmer glow than usual, as if suffering through its own nightmares. You pass by the hospital, where some patients lay awake, their eyes hollow and their minds fractured. The nurses worked ceaselessly, their hands moving with a mechanical precision born of desperation. Like them, others with no hint of sleep resumed their work. While some made time for their hobbies, which they wouldn't have earlier. The indomitable human spirit surprises you by finding purpose even in this hellscape.

You return to your modest home, hoping for a few hours of rest. But as you lay in bed, the horrors of your patients' tales invaded your mind.

The sound, soft at first, a mere tremor against the edge of sleep, worms its way deeper into your ears. It isn't a song, not quite, but a melody woven from grief, each note a tear trailing down a heartbroken face. The lullaby echoes in the dead of night, a haunting echo of a life extinguished.

Flickers of movement catch your eye—not from the familiar sway of the curtains or the dance of dust motes in the moonlight, but something deeper, more insidious. In the inky blackness, embers wink into existence, burning with an unnatural light. Were those eyes?

A tremor runs through you, a primal urge to fight against unseen bonds. Your breath hitched, each inhaling a struggle against a smothering pressure. Panic claws at your throat, a soundless scream trapped behind gritted teeth. Even blinking feels like a monumental effort. The world narrowed into a suffocating darkness, pressing on from all sides.

Finally, when you stop trying to sleep, you rise and pace the floor. Your reflection in the mirror twists and contorts, mocking your attempts at rational thought. You splash water on your face, but the cool liquid does nothing to dispel the heat of fear crawling up your spine.

Tomorrow, first thing in the morning, you have to find the root of this mass hysteria. Your thoughts are interrupted by a rising, chanting melody, sung in an unknown tongue that seemed to resonate through the very walls. You go over to the balcony, following the sharp moonlight. Instead, in the serene tableau, you saw something that defied comprehension. It was a sight your mind simply refused to process—a truth so terrible it choked the breath from your lungs.

The world tilted, a sickening lurch as the balcony railing betrayed you. The impact stole the air from your lungs, a symphony of wet snaps and searing pain. As your consciousness returns, your gaze falls upon a sight that shouldn't exist. A colossal hill, alien and out of place, had materialized where there was once only familiar ground. Something vast and terrible stood behind it—a glimpse of a horror unseen. The figure wasn't behind the newly erected hill; it wasn't on earth at all. It stood in the cosmos itself, looking at the earth. The figure was draped in a shroud, its skeletal frame made of writhing serpents.

The being was no mere monster; it was a harbinger, a walking omen of all the dark things that skulk just beyond the edges of sanity. It held a staff ablaze with souls in its right hand, and in its left, a decapitated head, one of its eyes taking the place of the moon itself. In the glowing eyes of the decapitated eyes, which you mistook for moonlight, you finally saw the hill for what it was.

You try to crawl with your hands, dragging your limp body away from the scene, but you can't. You try to close your eyes, but they disobey your wish. Is this just your imagination? A nightmare like your patients?

The people of Kungrat were out on the streets. Some lay on the ground, their eyes gouged out and clutched in their hands. Some set ablaze, unable to comprehend the sheer magnitude of the being. Others knelt, worshipping the colossus. Is this our retribution?

The hill was not made of earth but of people. Their bones, their flesh, their aspirations, their dreams. The weight of the revelation crushes your spirit.

The creature dropped the decapitated head onto the hill. People who weren't on fire or had their eyes gouged out yet fell into a trance. The decapitated head opened his mouth, and the people climbed upon the hill and crawled in.

You aren't left behind. As you crawl, you feel a strange sense of bliss. As if the head were offering peace from the horrors of insomnia-induced nightmares. Your last thought, as you crawl to salvation, is the memory of a town that had forgotten how to sleep.
