[It’s been a while.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/j3ONpnR644)

I’ve meant to update things a few times over the last five years, but work and life just keep getting in the way. Sorry about that. In my defense, I’ve been going through a lot, and keeping all of you safe in the process. Honestly I  probably wouldn’t have done any updates if I hadn’t seen so much activity on here recently.

The past few months have had a MAJOR uptick in Veil activity, especially on this very forum. From someones account of a horseman of the apocalypse ending the world to a supposed “time traveler” (we all got a good laugh out of that one) warning everyone about the end. I promise, there’s no apocalypse heading our way, we’re making sure of that.

Sorry, probably should make things a little easier to understand. If you’re only seeing this post, check back on my original from five years ago. My dad died around the beginning of 2020, leaving plenty of unresolved childhood trauma for me to work through. Therapy’s been helpful for that, but I’m not going to get into those sessions here. No, everyone was more interested in the box of tapes he left me. Reel after reel of emergency alert broadcasts that showed the end of dimensions just like our own. Parallel universes blinking out thanks to Aberrations taking over. Watching them… well, it took a toll on me for a while. Things were bleak, but I finally took my dads’ advice and went on a search for where they came from.

Search makes it seem like it took a lot of effort. I promise, if you want to find the Collective, you won’t. They find you. Fast, too. I had barely packed when a couple of Men in Black wannabes were at my doorstep. Guess I can’t be too surprised since dad used to work for them. Turns out there’s some hereditary factor to seeing Aberrations, and yours truly won the genetic lottery.

They did the usual secret police stuff- blindfold me and take me elsewhere, some undisclosed location in the deep South. I’ll be honest, I thought I was going to get two in the back of the head and tossed into the swamps for a few minutes there, even though I knew who they were. Think it’s because I knew who they were that I thought I would die, actually. They’re pretty lax about “whistleblowers” thanks to just how batshit everything we deal with is, but I didn’t know at the time. Hell, the old posts are still up and I’m allowed to write these out to, in the words of my Superior Officers, “blow off steam” because NOBODY IS GOING TO FUCKING BELIEVE ME ANYWAY. Honestly, it’s freeing. I dealt with HIPPA for a healthcare job while I was still in college and this place is much more relaxed than that.

Anyway, neither here nor there. They transported me KGB style to a base the Collective has down in the South, and there was a welcoming committee of one guy. He was nice enough, older, kind smile, said his name was Ronald. Not even joking, this was more like a corporate job orientation than anything else, and thinking back it’s almost comical how laid back everything was. He even made sure to tell me about the dental benefits, and that’s more than any job would’ve given me with my Doctorates degree. 

To put things bluntly- the Collective monitors something called the Veil in our world. The Veil protects us, keeps everything separate from other realities. Other realities that can get really weird, and really dangerous, depending on what goes down. The Veil makes sure that it doesn’t spill over into other realities. Usually, anyway. Sometimes, depending on the severity of what goes down in other realities, tears can form in the Veil. That’s when we have a problem.

Tears have to be stitched up as soon as they happen, otherwise the shit happening backstage spills out into a very unwitting audience. According to Ronald, there was a pretty high uptick in tears that started about a year before Dad died. Guess I know what made his heart finally give out. 

Essentially, there are two divisions to the Collective that prevent apocalyptic events from spilling over into our reality. The first is the Observation Division, which is where I ended up stationed. We keep an eye on everything beyond the Veil, all the other parallel universes out there, and use that to help predict where things could go wrong, essentially stopping them before they get a chance to take hold on home turf. 

The Intervention Division monitors our own side of the Veil. They have Cognizants set up on 24/7 monitors, looking all over our world to make sure that when and if any tears open up, we can have agents on the ground to fix it as soon as possible. I’m not even going to try to explain how they close the tears back up because that’s something well beyond my pay grade, but they stitch it back like professional seamsters and keep the rest of you none the wiser.

Now, when it comes to this forum, we’ve been seeing a lot of posts pop up FROM other parallel dimensions. Which is odd considering it’s a digital platform. Usually, analog is the only way to observe or record anything that comes through the Veil, so posts over the internet are definitely something new that we’re still figuring out how to deal with. 

For example, a couple of months ago there was a post that made it surprisingly high, thankfully most everyone thought it was a work of fiction (perks of the game, I guess), and disregarded it. It was a direct, eye witness account of the Biblical apocalypse. I mean big-B Biblical, Four Horseman, Book of Revelations level shit. Heartbreaking to read, considering it ended with the witness committing suicide to avoid being taken, but it gave us the heads up we need to figure out something bad was on the way. Thanks to that post, we were able to stop an Aberration that would have wiped 90 percent of the Earth in one day 

Then we get weird shit like the New Years Eve 2024 incident. Guy claimed to be a time traveler, coming back to warn us about the impending tears that were popping up all over the Veil in his timeline before he blew the brains out of his childhood self and his parents. Thankfully the Collective found him before he was able to get through the door of “his” childhood home. Look, I don’t know how the Collective in his universe operated, but holy shit were they bad at their jobs. Fuckers sent a man through a tear like it was going to send him back in time. Idiots should’ve known time travel doesn’t work that way, and that tear just sent him to a whole different dimension- ours. Yeah, his warning would’ve gone nowhere because we were already on the anomaly that caused all those tears in the first place, unlike his Collective. What a catastrophic failure that was, not to mention how it endangered countless other universes along with his own. 

Fun, or not so fun, fact- we did an observation on his dimension not long after apprehending him- that shit is GONE. I mean gone, like wiped from the fabric of reality. They really fucked up.

All thanks to the work of us in the Observation Division, and those that came before us, we’re still here safe. I know humans have been doing a good job of fucking up their own lately, but trust me, compared to some of the shit that the Collective has taken out of play in the past few decades, we’ve gotten off lucky.

Ronald gave me access to all of Dad’s old case files when I started here too. Said to think about it like a kind of signing bonus that would help me learn more about him, I guess. Let me tell you… what he snuck out on those VHS tapes was enough to desensitize me to a lot, but what was still in here was… damn. It was something I never expected. Seeing a spider god emerge and nuclear zombies devastate everything was nothing. 

Alright, I’m going to stop my ramblings about what I’ve been through. If anyone wants more information about the Collective I can easily answer questions. Like I said, they don’t give a shit who talks because it’s not like anyone is going to take this seriously in the first place. I’ve got case files to share though, some of Dad’s, some from the people before him, and some from my own cases that I’ve worked on. Like I said, I’ve been really busy since taking up a job here, and in between delving into his old stuff, trying to find out who the man that barely raised me really was, I’ve had my own fair share of brushes with the strange and deadly. Enough yapping, I know what you’re here for.

THE COFFIN
Earth Designation- 38994
Case File of Jeremiah [REDACTED]

12/13/1981

Intercepted some concerning news broadcasts from Earth 38994 yesterday. That universe got ahead of the space race in a big way, with America beating the Soviets by over a decade and branching out with privatized aerospace contracts in the ensuing years. Since then it’s been a mad frenzy for them with everyone trying to work on space projects. One company is building a huge base on the moon to find out what lies beneath. Another is customizing space stations for the rich and famous to hide away in the event Earth ends up going to hell. The one we need to keep an eye on though is Avarice Corporation. I haven’t been able to find an analogous company here for them, but they’re huge over there and trying to figure out faster than light travel. News broadcast is touting that they’ll be launching their first test flight of a special nuclear fission engine later tonight. Even found a way to broadcast what they see, though there’s not going to be any way to get a signal until they’re out of FTL speed.

Agatha is backing me on this one. She’s been doing her usual thing and saying dark, cryptic things. Ever since the spider incident a few years ago she’s been in rough shape but I don’t think anything’s spooked her this bad since. We’re having a little watch party later on. Her words in the meantime make me want to jump into a fire just to get rid of the cold chill they gave me- “Everyone thinks outrunning the sun is a good idea until they find out the darkness is faster.”

Test flight unsuccessful. The ship took off around noon Eastern time, and judging by the broadcast that was being sent from the ship, actually made it to their destination. Simple enough, they were just supposed to hop to the edge of the Milky Way then make the return flight. Broadcast came in almost right on time, though it’s not like you could see a whole lot. There was vague light from some stars, but mostly it was just the dark void of empty space. Then this… I swore for a minute some cheap scifi movie cut in. It looked like this huge carved stone coffin floating right by the camera, bright chains wrapping all around it, reflecting any light that dared get too close with their shiny links. 

This thing had to be bigger than a planet. It was obviously some distance from the ship, but we only saw it for a few minutes before the signal was lost again, seemingly jumping to FTL speed and losing the broadcast. It stayed out for about two minutes. Agatha and I were about to cut the feed, figuring that was it and our worries were unfounded. Maybe the people on board had some kind of sense about them and turned around instead of investigating whatever that thing was. Feed came back though, and I don’t think I’ve felt my stomach drop this bad since the Heaven incursion on Earth 84778 a couple of years ago. The camera was reeling through empty space, spinning around so that nothing stayed in frame for more than a few seconds, but luckily not with fast enough velocity that everything was incomprehensible. Debris was everywhere, making it hard to see through it all, but then… well, we saw the chains floating free, links broken. I assume they aimed right at the coffin and dialed the FTL engine to the max, hitting it head on to break it open. 

We were on edge watching from here. The camera rotation kept revealing what was happening piece by piece. First we saw the massive slab holding the coffin shut start to lift, a long, blackened hand extending to push it up further. As it opened further stars in the background began to blink out, one by one. The thing that emerged was a manifestation of darkness, night made physical. It was huge, dark wings sprouting from its back and no definable features on its skin. It looked humanoid, though with tendrils of darkness wrapped around it, it was kind of hard to tell. As it rose from the coffin it seemed to begin absorbing any light that came near it, sucking it in like a black hole, singularity blazing against it’s skin, absorbing any energy it saw. The camera eventually flew towards it, getting sucked into the darkness and losing broadcast signal.

That was enough to let us know this world was a lost cause. Whatever this thing was, there’s no way that humanity could put those chains back. We’ll continue observation for the coming days but… well, it was broadcast on international television there, so they’re already in rough shape.

NOTICE TO ALL COLLECTIVE PERSONNEL AND CONTRACTORS

Going forward, there is a moratorium on the study of lightspeed or faster than light travel in any form. Even theoretical physics pertaining to lightspeed travel are prohibited until we can figure out what this thing is and ensure it doesn’t exist on our side of the Veil.

Thank you for your understanding,

Jeremiah.

As expected, things aren’t going well for that version of Earth. Not long after the broadcast aired, people started taking to the streets, demanding to know who greenlit the project, going after government officials and the CEO of Avarice to hold them to justice for dooming humanity. Meanwhile, space telescopes and satellites on the far side of the Milky Way were sending back images of a galaxy that was becoming less and less crowded of stars by the moment. Everything that could give off light, from stars to small clusters of radiation and space dust, were slowly absorbed into… well, whatever the hell that thing was. Agatha named it the Night Emperor. Sounds like a Conan villain in my opinion but… I’ll let her stick with naming things. Feels wrong to give whatever this thing was a name that sounds like a comic villain when it’s about to slaughter an entire universe.

News broadcasts are giving hourly updates on information they get, including new pictures and at one point a live video feed from a space telescope that was launched a few years ago. The Night Emperor, as of 1600 hours Eastern time zone here, has successfully absorbed every star and nebula it’s crossed and is now just outside the orbital track of Neptune. Judging by the rate it’s going, it will reach Earth within the next day. Humanity is taking it about as well as to be expected. Some have splintered into cult factions that are offering up politicians, scientists, and other figures to the Night Emperor in an attempt to broker peace. Unfortunately for them, this thing just doesn’t care. 

It seems to only have the motivation to spread darkness where it goes. I would like to note that the darkness that follows it doesn’t only emanate from it, but grows, spreading like a corruption over all it touches. I can’t say for sure that anything it absorbs is necessarily destroyed, so much as it is just swallowed and left in an eternal state of night, as no light seems capable of penetrating this dark.

Agatha posited that the Night Emperor would not stop at Earth. I fear she was correct. Upon reaching the orbital path of Earth early this morning, I fully expected the being to stop. Perhaps I’ve been reading too many pulp stories. In their reality though, the Night Emperor is as uncaring for life as the darkness it brings. Earth was an afterthought to it, simply passing by with little care. News stations set up outside to get a view of it as it passed and the footage is something that will stay with me forever. In broad daylight, this thing just passes by, larger than Earth itself. The face could be clearly seen as it passed, pure darkness for the most part, with no mouth to speak of, but one massive, bulging white eye right in the middle. I can’t help but be reminded of the Greek myth of Erebus, the god of primordial darkness. Even before Earth and the Sun, there was the darkness that man would come to fear, for no other reason than the unknown that lurks within it.

It passed by Earth and the darkness began to spread across the land not long after. Reports flooded in of people going out during bright daylight only to be attacked brutally by their own shadows, unable to fight back as their own darkness fought its way in. A reporter doing an outdoors segment when the Night Emperor passed by watched in horror, recorded live for everyone to see, as her shadow unstuck itself from the pavement in the daylight. It just… grew from the sidewalk, the air popping as it lengthens in the bright sunlight, the Night Emperor leaving it behind as it continued on toward the great star that brought us all life. Then it grabbed the reporter, one long hand on either side of her head, spindly fingers reaching into her mouth as it tore her jaw from her skull, ducking into her now eternally screaming mouth and forcing its entire being down into her body. Tendrils swirled around her, dark shadows breaking through her skin as it settled into its new home, before she began attacking the others around her.

The rest of the day followed much the same, with others falling victim to their own shades in quick succession. The shadows that took over then would lend their help to others so they could get their own skin suits, darkness invading everyone. No amount of light could stop it, not since the Night Emperor was free. 

The last broadcast that came through was from a station still holding out somehow. They were staying in shade, and they theorized that was able to camouflage them from their own shadows long enough to get the final moments of Earth on analog. The Night Emperor, still massive in the sky, floated ever closer to the sun, the center of all life, and simply… absorbed it. One moment it was there, the next it had been taken into the Night Emperor, plunging everything in the universe into eternal darkness. There was a brief cacophony of screams on the broadcast before the fluorescent lights in the studio revealed shadows coming in from every crack outside as frost began to quickly form everywhere.

Earth 38994 has officially been deemed a lost cause as of 2000 hours Eastern standard time. It’s recommended that the moratorium on light speed and faster than light travel continue until further notice, barring any confirmation of the Night Emperor’s casket in our [universe](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/njM4ilFA71).
