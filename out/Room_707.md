Where am I? What year is it? When did this all start? 

The last thing I remember was being with my grandmother on a hot summers day in 1979. She wasn't a very pleasant person to be around and always wanted to talk to me about being a better woman either by the way I dress or having a different attitude. She was a very classic women with a no nonsense attitude. 
That day she was very different.
The day started very early- we went to the hardware store, then the flower shop, drove along the river for a while and then finally we went to the grocer. She never said a word to me all day. She was buying her usual groceries and magazines but not once did she ask me anything about what I wanted to eat for the last few weeks of being with her. At some point I lost her among the bread and meat isle. I figured I could sneak a can of pop in the cart while she wasnt looking. The drive back to her house was in silence. She took the long way home. I was in the back seat reading the magazine and sipping on the pop she bought since she wasn't speaking to me. She pulled into the driveway and got out of the car-leaving the driver's side door open and myself locked in the back. I figured she just forgot or something...until I noticed she was talking to two very dark looking characters in suits. The conversation was quick- a few words, a nod and a handoff of a very plump envelope and the men hightailed it for the car I was in. One swung the passanger side door open while the other slipped into the driver's side. And just like that they pulled out of the driveway and my grandmother was out of site. Screaming and yelling with protest and begging to be let out. The man in the passanger seat turned around and shot me with what looked like a dart. 

I woke up here.

 In a small, dimly lit, cold room I woke up with no shoes or undergarments and only a short, disgusting hospital gown on. There were other women in this room with me in the same circumstances- no shoes, no undergarments, and a short, very used hospital gown. We all had a small mattress with moth holes in them but no pillows and only a few blankets. The room was always lit and it was always cold. There was one fluorescente light in the middle of the ceiling that never stopped flickering. The walls had paint peeling in various spots and the floors looked like they had not been cleaned in years. There was a single long window with two sets of very thick bars that never seemed to get enough sunlight during dawn or dusk. 

Silence.

Silence was all we women shared with eachother. Tired, sore, and cold we all sat and stared off into whatever distance we faced.
All we get to eat each day was one meal that consisted of one egg, half a peeled apple or orange, and half a piece of untoasted wheat bread. Sometimes a few of the women were given a watered down cup of tea. Anyone who got this cup of tea on their tray was also usually picked for the gurney. There was an unknown waiting period we all faced but that cup of tea was usually when the timer started for us. Usually the nurse that handed out the food didnt care if we finished the tray or not but if you had that tea on your tray you had to finish it regardless of how you felt. 

We watched as the unlucky women who had to finish the tea drank their cups and were quickly ushered from the room. We wouldn't see these women again for hours and maybe even for days. Every once in a while a women wouldn't make it back to the room at all. We never knew what happened to these women, we never asked either. I guess we all hoped maybe they were in another room, another wing, maybe they were let go. 

Today I found a cup on my tray.
This will be the third time ive gotten this cup. 

I looked up at the nurse who handed me the tray but his eyes never met mine. 
"You have 5 minutes to eat then return your tray." 

I started eating my meal slowly and anxiously. I only got the bread and fruit down before the nurse rushed up to me and yelled "DRINK THE TEA NOW!" 

Shocked I drank the cup down and was forced from the room onto the gurnery waiting outside the room. I was strapped down limb by limb and wheeled away. An IV was jabbed into my arm and after a few seconds everything started to get fuzzy but it didnt go black this time. I was able to see that I was being wheeled down a long hallway passed two sets of elevators and a set of stairs before finally being wheeled into an "employees only" elevator. 
There were a group of people in scrubs and one man with gloves all the way up to his elbows. 
The man with the gloves started asking his questions: 
"How much did she eat? What time did she finish the tea? Has the infusion finished? Why the FUCK are you wearing that stupid watch again? You are going to contaminate EVERYTHING!" 

I counted the amount of ticks coming off the clock behind them waiting for whatever was going to happen to happen. 

"GET HER FUCKING READY FOR THE TRANSFUSION AND TRY NOT TO FUCK THIS GIRL UP THIS TIME" yelled the doctor.

"Yes doctor" murmered the nurse. 
The nurse pulled his watch off and started counting under his breath. 

"One mississippi, two mississippi."
A new bag was placed next to the IV sac that was hanging above my head

"Four mississippi, five mississippi."
The straps came off and I was roughly placed onto a wheelchair and my arms strapped down.
"Six mississippi, seven mississippi." 
A tapping sound behind me, maybe a syringe being prepared? 
SNAP 
"Fuck...fuck..fuck.
FUCK what number was I on?" 
Some rustling behind me
"Uh six mississippi"
I felt a sharp jab in my arm
"Seven, eight, nine, ten."
Pressure. And warmth. 
"Okay. Next goes the flush." 

Nothing happened. I waited for something else to get injected but nothing came. 
I started to feel myself being wheeled around the corner and down another hall. We were going past a bunch of numbered rooms.
"Which room was it again? 705,706, or 707? Yeah, 707... thats right." 
The nurse sounded like he was more confused than I was.
Im brought into a dimly lit room and wheeled over to the side of a bed. After a few moments of fiddling from the nurse he finally exits the room and I look up.

On virtually any surface that could hold them were various beautiful assortments of flowers, teddy bears, and balloons all saying "get well soon" and "go with the first born and heal." There is a heart monitor going off on the opposide side of the bed and in that bed layed a very frail looking women. She has a tube going down her throat and a machine connected to that tube for assisted breathing. There are many empty IV bags in sink, like the nurse left them there for later. Another machine infront of the bed making a shifting sound. I look down at my arm.

We are both connected to this machine. 

My blood is going into this machine and being pumped into this women. 

"What the fuck" I murmer. Fidgeting I manage to free one arm and pull the IV out of my arm. I watched as the machine starts pulling the last of my blood and some air like a straw run out of its drink towards itself.

I blink. The air reaches the machine and shoots straight into the women on the bed. She starts fidgeting violently while her heart monitor starts going crazy and then finally, after a few seconds, it flatlines.

Panicked I free my other arm and get off the chair. With my head spinning I look around to see where I can go. I see a linen closet to the left in a dark corner and I rush to get inside. 

"WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON." 
The nurse rushes into the room with the doctor, covered in blood, behind him. 
"What the fuck. Where is the surrogate patient?" Said the nurse in a bemused tone.
The doctor started shouting looking at the scene. 
"GET THE CRASH TEAM IN HERE NOW YOU FUCKING IDIOT!"
The nurse trips out of the room and shouts "CODE BLUE: ROOM 707 NOW!"

Five other people enter the room and they start doing chest compressions for what seemed like forever until finally a sickening CRUNCH sounded off.
"STOP! STOP...WE'VE BROKEN HER STERNUM  AND A RIB. IF WE CONTINUE WE WILL PUNCTURE A LUNG AND WE WILL HAVE TO ANSWER FOR THE ORGAN DAMAGE." Says a nurse in blue.

The doctor stood infront of the linen closet in silence until finally...
"HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?! HOW ARE WE GOING TO EXPLAIN THAT THIS WOMEN IS DEAD. HER GROUP PAYS US ALOT OF MONEY TO KEEP HER ALIVE!" 
Silence from the nurses.

"NURSE! NURSE WHERE IS THE SURROGATE
DID SHE DRINK ALL OF HER TEA?" Shouted the doctor.

" y-yes" whimpered the nurse.

"AND DID YOU ADMINISTER HER SEDATIVE IN FIFTEEN SECONDS INTERVALS?" 

"y-yess" lied the nurse.

"THEN WHY THE FUCK IS THE VIAL STILL FULL"
 *SMACK*
The doctor smacked the nurse and blood from his gloves splashed everywhere. 

"You better find that surrogate patient or I will make you the surrogate 
AND I WONT UNPLUG THE RAPID TRANSFUSER!" 

Without a word the nurse rushed out of the room leaving the doctor and the now dead women in the room.

The doctor looked at the bed and said "Well at least your organs wont go to waste bonnie." And he walked away froom the room.

I waited a few more minutes for anyone to  come back to the room but no one came. 

I opened the door and sprinted for my life down the hall hoping no one sees me but as I got to the elevators I heard the nurse in blue shout
"THE SURROGATE IS AT THE ELEVATORS!" 

With my heart pounding against my chest I noticed a set of doors marked "Stairs" and took a chance. I ran through the door and practically floated down the first set of stairs trying to force the set of doors open but they wouldn't budge. The doors above me slammed open and I could hear two sets of foot steps stomping down the stairs after me. Running down another three flights of stairs I noticed the door marked 3 was ajar so I ran through it. 

It was a dark hallway with room doors open at odd angles. This ward looked unused so I picked a random room and went to hide. I looked around the room and rushed behind the curtains. I heard the doorway to the stairs slam open and voices getting closer. I backed away from the opening praying they wouldn't see my feet and as I backed away I knocked into something. I turned around and saw gowns like mine in a giant pile and a body on the bed. She was cold and grey and had IV marks up and down her arm. There was a chart next to the bed that had a large red stamp

DECEASED: SURROGATE #12
CAUSE OF DEATH: HEART ATTACK DUE TO MASSIVE BLOOD LOSS
PATIENT LAST TRANSFUSED IN ROOM 707
UNSUCCESFUL REVIVAL OF PATIENT 

Shocked I dropped the chart. 

Fuck

Foots steps getting closer to the room I was in so I bum rushed the door back to the stairway and down I went again. 

"COME BACK YOU FUCKING BITCH!" One nurse screamed out at me as I kept going.

I ran down another three flights of stairs and rushed out of the door with a large 1 on it. 
It looked like a normal hospital with nurses all around, patients being wheeled around and people in tow. 

I looked around at all these people and before I could think I shouted
"SOMEBODY CALL 911 THEY ARE KILLING US!" 

*BOOM* 
The doors busted open behind me and all I could do was run. 
It all happened in slow motion.
I ran past all these people towards the front door and put my hands on the door to push it open. 

*pop*  *pop*

I felt woozy.
I looked down and there were two darts in my left calf. 
I turned around and with a whirl I saw all the people around me looking on in confusion. 

"Please do not panic- patients from the psychiatric ward must not be left unattended." 

I heard these words fade into oblivion.








*Tink SHUCK Tink SHUCK Tink SHUCK* 

I opened my eyes and found myself extremely light headed. My arms, legs and head strapped down to the chair. I noticed three IV's connected to me in various spots sucking blood from my body. Three more lines leading to the nurse that put me in this chair with a total of six lines going to the Rapid transfusion machine leading to one large line connected to another unconscious person on a hospital bed. My eyesight was fading fast but I had one last look at the room number.

Room 707
 
*BEEP* 


I woke up to the sound of the machine stopping and the doctor disconnecting the nurse.

"Pleease... we got her back.... please..." 
The doctor took a pair of large scissors and  lazily cut the IVs allowing his blood to the flow to the floor.
"You stupid fuck, you nearly compromised everything." 
 I heard a gargle and the voice of the nurse faded- leaving only his watch ticking away.


The doctors boots stomped over to me. I looked up into the doctors eyes- his eyes were wild and blood shot with anger...

"Rest in peace surrogate #13."
I couldn't find the strength to beg for my life- all I could do was watch as he lifted those large scissors to my lines.
He cut the lines to my IV and as I watched my blood drip the floor I felt my heart failing me until


darkness.



"Doctor... the transfusion didnt work... hes still out cold... we will need to intubate to save his life..."
