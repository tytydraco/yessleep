Retired navy seal here living alone, I haven't been the same since my wife died from a heart attack a few years back. When I was very little in the early 60s I remember growing up in a city in Wisconsin called Cheddar Town. It was in a fairly agricultural area, so it probably got its name from the large fields with cows.

It was a beautiful large open city with many farmhouses and stores, though it wasn't a safe area, crime was high and there were a lot of wildfires that damaged the area. I remember a fire sparked at the nearby power plant, so the electricity in the whole town went out for like a week.

When I was around 6, a large superstorm struck the city and spawned dozens of tornadoes, we hid in the shelter and had to hear our house get torn apart. The storm passed at night, and our house had been nearly wiped off of its foundation, with just bare floors and a few standing walls, but luckily we had packed some of our valuables when we were in the shelter.

We went through a lot of financial struggle, but we were able to find a house in another town. We didn't talk much about my childhood town, it's just become a distant memory. I've spent the past 10 years searching for Cheddar Town online, but I can't find anything about a city like that in Wisconsin. My parents are the only other people I know who remember living in Cheddar Town, though they don't remember where it's located.

What's weird is that I've just recently been having a series of dreams about the city, they've been really disturbing, and I haven't been able to get a lot of sleep. I have this reoccurring dream of being in my bedroom of the childhood home at night and hearing the tornado sirens outside. I run out of my room to find my parents but they aren't there. I run in the dining room and the power goes out. I hear loud screaming coming from my room, then I find myself unable to move, the sirens get more staticky and distorted before the dream ends, as if it's getting ripped apart by the tornado.

Another dream I had last night took place in the living room of my childhood home. I was on the couch at night in the dark watching a cartoon (tom and jerry or something) on the old 60s tv, then the screen cuts to a tornado emergency, then cuts to a woman in a dark room staring at the camera, she was sobbing hysterically, her mouth stretched unnaturally wide, then the screen turned to static.

I don't want to go to sleep tonight, I've had 7 bad nights in a row. I just wanna visit Cheddar Town again to maybe get rid of the dreams, but I can't find anything online and I have no idea where it is in Wisconsin, it could've been so severely damaged by the storm that it was either abandoned or rebuilt and given a different name.

The city even had a radio station, and I've been driving around the state with the car radio set to that station to see if I can get a signal, but it doesn't pick up anything, though one night when it was raining, there were a few seconds where the radio started playing old vintage music, then it turned to static again. I felt uneasy and decided to come back home and call it a night.

I've been asking people on this site and on online communities dedicated to Wisconsin if they have any idea where Cheddar Town is, though the internet's been going out frequently.

EDIT\*

It's been a weird few weeks, but I purchased a 1992 mobile radio that has a more advanced signal tracker, I know it was manufactured nearly a decade ago, but it was the only one I could find at the nearby thrift store.

It had been a few nights since I had gone out trying to find the old station, since I had been experimenting with the mobile radio, and it sure does pick up a lot of stations, but it hadn't picked up the station from Cheddar Town yet.

I noticed the mobile radio works much better in clear weather, so I decided to bring it with me in the car on a clear sunny day and try to pick up the signal. It had been a few hours of searching and I knew I only had a couple hours of sunlight left. It was around the time I decided to turn around and head back home when the mobile radio picked up something.

After a few hours of just hearing static, the sudden shift in noise startled me. It was playing old vintage music again, it went out and came back in a few times while I drove back and forth like a maniac trying to see where it was picking up the music. I had to find a U-turn that led me to a road where the radio picked up a stronger signal.

I had a rush of excitement as I drove down the wide road and the music became clearer. As I drove, the buildings and houses around became less and less frequent, until all there was were open fields, power lines, trees and windmills. After about an hour, I noticed there were no longer windmills, and the road became very old and cracked, I had to avoid a lot of potholes. I also noticed a lot of downed power lines, and the trees became more frequent.

There were a lot of uprooted trees, some small trees were on the road, so I had to drive off the road a couple times. As the sun was setting, my excitement slowly turned to fear. I felt the urge to turn around and forget about Cheddar Town, but I just kept driving. There was no sign of human civilization for miles besides the road and the power lines, the music it was picking up also made me uneasy. The music sounded so eerie and monotone, something from like a hundred years ago.

The stronger the signal got, the more debris I found on the road, until I came to a stop at large metal gates covered in vines and surrounded by trees. By this point, the music had gotten quite loud and clear, but then it stopped abruptly and cut to static, which was odd.

As I got out of the car I noticed the vines on the gates were so overgrown that I couldn't even see through it. I was eventually able to pull the gates open after using my camping knife to cut through the vines. It wasn't until stepping in that I was sure it was the place I was looking for. Close to the fence was a large white brick building covered in dirt and moss, I immediately recognized it as the back of my old elementary school.

I found the backdoor that led into the school, though it seemed to be warped, so I had to kick it open, and I got hit with the wave of a mildewy smell. The floor and base boards were covered in dirt, as if it had flooded. I found the library at the end of the hall, it looked like it had been completely unchanged since I had went there, minus the mold and dirt.

The colorful rugs, books and posters were still there. I was exploring the classrooms when I heard a door swing open nearby. The thought of someone else being in this abandoned building with me sent a wave of adrenaline and I ran out of the school. While I ran back to the gates, I noticed it was the backdoor of the school that was open, and I was sure that I had closed it when I entered. That door was pretty warped from water damage, and it had been a particularly windy day, so I figured that perhaps I hadn't properly closed it and the wind blew it open.

Truth is, I didn't want to leave, It took me hours to drive here, not even including the past 10 to 15 years of searching for this place. I found the gates to the field of the school, but it seemed to have been severely damaged by a tornado. fence was mangled and twisted, and the bleachers had crashed in on themselves. I was surprised to see the old poster on the school had been untouched. It was the poster of the soccer team mascot, a rubber hose style bat, the team named "Cheddar Town Hurricanes".

Across from the school were many abandoned shops and houses I remember, but most were damaged or boarded up. I noticed on some buildings were large black marks, as if there had been more wildfires. The main thing I was really looking for in Cheddar Town was where my childhood home used to be, but I was also looking for the thrift shop that we always went to, and I eventually found it.

The windows had been boarded up, but the doors were off their hinges. Since the windows were boarded up and there was no electricity, it was pretty dark in there. I was walking down one of the aisles when I was jolted by the sound of one of the toys going off in the corner of the store. It was a large toy of the bat mascot that had been going off. The toy danced and lights flashed through its large grin and pie-cut eyes as it played distorted vintage music. It must've been motion activated, I was surprised it still worked. The toy was massive, about 2 meters tall. I remember it from back when we went to the shop all the time, I had wanted to get it, but it costed a fortune. I never knew the bat's name, so I just called him the doll. When the toy finished its song and dance, the lights in its face went out, and it slumped over.

I didn't know what to make of it, though my mindset hadn't changed for nearly 40 years... I still wanted that toy.

But I decided to leave the store to find the remains of my old house and maybe I would come back to figure out that situation. When I turned around to leave, I thought I saw something move outside the window. I didn't see anything when I walked outside- figured it could've been the shadow of a bird.

I couldn't find the remains of the house, but I could find that the power plant was still standing, which meant I hadn't even made it a quarter of the way through the city, and by this point it was pitch black outside, I was only able to see because of the moonlight.

This was a dangerous thing to do, but I decided to go into the power plant and see if I could turn on the electricity. The temperature dropped significantly upon entering the control room within the foundation, and it was completely silent. It was a good thing there was a full moon that night, because the light illuminating through the entrance was the only way I could see where some of the switches were. I flipped a few, but they didn't do anything. When I pulled one of the levers, the fluorescent light in the room flickered, and the machinery in the plant roared to life.

Some old street lights around the area were still working, though many had been downed. After following the road across from the power plant, I couldn't recognize the rural neighborhood I was in, so I was nowhere near where my old house was. The lights had flickered for the past half hour, then they eventually went out. As I walked through a particularly overgrown area, the wind howled through the leaves of the trees.

I heard some rustling in the bushes, and at first I figured it was also caused by the wind, though this sound seemed to become more aggressive, and it was only heard in the bushes to my left, so I just walked a bit faster in case it was an animal.

The path got more narrow, so the bushes were closer, and so did the rustling sound behind me. I remember it almost sounded more like the clinking of metal. My speed walking turned to running, and my running continued until I was far away from the forest area and was back in one of the neighborhoods. It was at this point when I realized I was completely lost.

I knew I wasn't going to find the way out of here before dawn, and my Nokia phone couldn't get any reception. I had no desire to sleep anyway in that place. As I ran back through the forest area, I didn't hear the rustling again and I was able to find the part of the city I was previously in.

After hours of wandering through the city, the sun begin to rise again, and it reminded me how tired I was.

I found the thrift shop with that toy I wanted. The sun shined directly through the entrance, so it was much easier to see. I looked for where the bat was, but I couldn't find it. Perhaps I was looking in the wrong places, but after searching all throughout the store, it was nowhere to be seen. Weird, perhaps there was still someone running the store, which seemed impossible, I thought I was alone in Cheddar Town. And that would mean I would still have to pay for the doll. I found it in the backroom of the store, in the corner. I hadn't seen anyone in the store, so I decided to just take it. The doll was heavier than I thought, but I was able to carry it all the way to the gates, which were wide open.

Luckily I could cram it into the car without breaking it, and I found my way home.

EDIT 2\*

I think the doll is really cool, a relic from my early days, but things haven't been the same since I brought it home. I said how it would play vintage music as it would dance and it may be motion activated or something, but I really don't know how it works. It activates itself at odd times, going off at night for seemingly no reason.

My nightmares have gotten really bad since I've brought the doll home, to the point where I wake up sick and throwing up.

But one night I had a nightmare that jolted me awake, and I heard the doll had been activated outside my room. I went into the living room and saw it malfunctioning. It was shuttering as it moved, causing a loud metal clinking sound inside, but something about the music it was playing seemed odd, it wasn't music, it sounded like a person talking in a foreign language, but it was hard to tell since the quality of the speakers were awful.

For the past few nights my house has been filled with a faint smokey smell, I called someone over to find where it was coming from, but the guy couldn't find the source and told me that it could just be a neighbor burning things outside.

I had forgotten that the doll can move. When I was 5, the manager of the thrift store told me that the doll had wheels and it could move from place to place during certain hours without tripping, which was advanced for its time. I was just surprised recently that the wheels still work.

Last night I didn't have very bad nightmares, but I was sleeping on my side, and I was facing the wall, and I was awoken by the sound of crackling behind me. I turned around and saw the doll standing over my bed, emitting an awful smokey smell. It wasn't moving and it's face wasn't lighting up, but it was playing the same sound that I had heard the other night, this time I could hear it better. It sounded like a deep distorted voice singing in a foreign language, but it stopped just a few seconds after I looked at it.

It could've been a corrupted audio file built into the doll. I've been trying to find how the thing even works, the fact that the batteries still work after so long seems impossible. But I'm definitely gonna sleep with the door closed tonight.
