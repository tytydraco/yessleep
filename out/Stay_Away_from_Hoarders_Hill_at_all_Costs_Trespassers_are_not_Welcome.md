“There it is!” called out the boy in front. I looked up from my game as the old van made its way around the tree-filled bend, revealing today’s latest adventure to stave off boredom. The structure loomed over everything in the overgrown clearing and the dense woods beyond, windows broken with shards of glass as if fangs in mouths, paint peeling and wood splintering in such a way it made the walls look like fur. Despite so many windows, light did not reach more than a few feet in, the inside a black hole swallowing up anything that dared come near.



And yet my brother and his friends had decided that day was the day they explored it: the mansion on Hoarder’s Hill.



You won’t find that name on any map. Hoarder’s Hill is the local name for the abandoned neighborhood, a ghost town even more haunting than the nearby Times Beach and possibly more dangerous. A little subdivision built winding up a road, blanketed in trees, no neighbors except for a couple retreat centers miles away. A dozen good-sized houses, give or take, traveling up the spiral road until it ended in the courtyard of a mansion.



All of them abandoned.



The six of us piled out of the van, me going last so I didn’t get in anyone’s way. Even before that day, that had been an awkward summer; we had moved from the other side of the state right after the school year ended, and while my brother Paul had wasted no time finding an entire new friend group, I hadn’t been quite so quick to make friends. I’d rather just spend the entire sweltering summer inside, playing the newly-released Nintendo DS I had just gotten for my birthday. Parents weren’t as fond of this idea and subjected my brother to babysitting me every day they could make him.



He didn’t make a big deal of it and let me be while he and the others got into trouble. He let me take my DS, too.



I put it away in my pocket as I got out, the adventures with my favorite bounty hunter taking a backseat to the decrepit mansion. “No one knows where it came from,” said the boy who had been driving, forcing unnecessary grandiose into his voice. “They say a century ago it just appeared on the top of this hill, a paved path leading right up to it. No one ever lived here, yet when people came and looked at it, it was full of junk.”



“So we’re going dumpster diving, Arnold?” asked Paul, looking back to check on me. I moved up next to him, feeling every bit as tiny as I was compared to the boys and girls all three years older than me. “This place looks like it’s about to collapse.”



“It’s always looked like this,” said Arnold, waving his hands around to emphasize his words. “Even a century ago it was a crumbling mess, but it never gets worse. It just looks like that, a living corpse. It drew people to it, and those people built their houses on its driveway. Yet every time someone moved in, people would see the change. Their houses would start out nice, the clutter inside simply their weird collections. But then it would stop being stuff and just become trash. It would spill out their houses like guts on a deer hit on the highway.”



“Ew!” said one of the girls, smacking Arnold on the shoulder. “Don’t talk about that!”



“That’s what it looked like, Heather!” he said to her. Then back to the rest of us. “And just as people would be about to intervene, the people who lived on the hill would vanish. Their junk, too. They say they moved every last bit they owned into the mansion.” He gestured up to the collapsing wreck. “Hidden past the junk are all their riches, their possessions that are still worth something. Still in the tight grip of their rotten, maggot-eaten hands.”



“Stop it!” Heather yelped again. “Stop talking about maggots and worms!”



“Come on, babe,” said Arnold, putting an arm around her. “Just how the stories go. Just think about all the jewelry hidden in there instead!”



“There’s nothing in there but garbage,” said Paul, folding his arms. I noticed the hair standing up on his arms despite how level his voice was. “Cool story, but it’s just an old place. Might be fun to check out, though.” He put on a smile for me, but also toward the other girl that had come with us, Susan. I rolled my eyes and moved a bit away to look over the mansion more. It groaned and grumbled with the wind, broken shutters clattering against the frames. I could almost feel eyes in the shattered windows gazing at each of us in turn, and I kept expecting the front double-doors to open and reveal a cavernous mouth, a whip-like tongue shooting out to gobble us all up. Hopefully Arnold, Heather and the other one first.



“Scary, isn’t it, Sheela?” asked a voice behind me that made me flinch. I whipped around to see the final member of that little expedition, his pathetic excuse for facial hair somehow still overgrown and messy. He towered over the rest, crammed into his clothes that were more a display of things I wished I hadn’t had to see. “Relax. I’ll be right by you. I got flashlights, snacks, some rope. Even my dad’s hunting knife. I came ready.” When he first started revealing the contents of his army jacket a part of me wanted to bolt down the road until I hit the highway.



“I-I’m not going in,” I said. “I’m gonna stay out here with the van. Keep an eye on it.”



“Anyone could come and grab you out here all alone,” said the boy, my own hair standing up as he tried to put an arm around me, feeling less like an act of comfort and more like the pincers of an antlion grappling at the torso of the insect that had fallen in. “Stay with us. I’ll make sure you stay safe.”



“And she can stay plenty safe waiting in the van,” said Paul, materializing between us and giving me the chance to back away. “No worries, Sheela. Arnold said he’d leave the keys with you.”



“You touch that wheel, you die, though,” said Arnold. He smirked following a glare from Paul. “I’m just kidding! No touching your kid sis, Paul.” He turned his focus back to Heather and Susan.



“I can’t drive anyway,” I said. “I’ll just wait.”



“That’s totally fine,” said Paul. I stood still, pretending to focus on the building as I heard him drag the other boy away. It wasn’t hard to hear what he must have thought was his quiet voice. “Off limits, Michael.”



“I’m just being nice,” Michael hissed back under his voice. “Can’t be nice to your sister?”



“She’s still in middle school,” he growled back. “You touch one hair on her head without her permission, I’m gouging your eyes out. Got it?” My body relaxed a little hearing that.



“You’re not her boss,” Michael grumbled. “Get off me.”



“Watch yourself,” said Paul, returning to me, Michael mumbling to himself as he rejoined the rest of the group. “You okay, Sheela?”



“Thank you,” I said. “Nothing happened.”



“And that’s why you’re staying out here,” he said. “Don’t worry. We’ll just be in for a couple hours while these jackasses give new meaning to the term ‘white trash.’” I chuckled. “Want to see what you’ll be missing out on first, though?” We all moved to the front, Arnold and Michael pushing the entrance open to loud groans; mostly from Michael, but some from the doors as well. They swung inside, their flashlights illuminating the expansive foyer.



A wall of junk taller than me, from one end of the room to the other. Newspapers upon newspapers forming geological layers alongside discarded cans and containers, broken bits of wood from old furniture, fluid-filled bottles I wouldn’t have opened if you had paid me, plastic bags, torn strips of clothing, random slabs of particle board, mangled silverware, bowling balls, a sawhorse, oddly-shaped rocks, what might have been a grand piano at one point, toys for pets, and row after row of empty picture frames. And that was what I could make out from the threshold, the stench reaching out like a toxic miasma to choke anyone foolish enough to breathe it. Throughout the front we could spot tunnels dug through the garbage, winding their way deeper. Up the stairs to the second floor? To the side rooms? To some hidden basement?



I stepped back. “I choose life,” I said.



“God,” said Heather. “There’s no way those tunnels aren’t loaded with rats and worms.”



“Come on,” said Arnold, sneaking his arm around her shoulders again. “You told me you think worms are cute.”



“I said you’d still be cute as a worm,” she said. “If I’m going in there, we have to go up top.”



“Brother told me the good stuff can only be reached by the tunnels,” said Arnold, getting down on all fours. “Looks plenty wide. The sawhorses are keeping it up. We just go in and crawl all the way.”



“Or we trigger a trap and die,” said Paul. “I’m taking the top.” He smiled to Susan. “Care to join me?” She nodded.



I took my leave, watching them all take their paths into the mansion. Arnold crawled down the tunnel, Heather following him. Paul and his crush started their climb up onto the top of the compacted garbage, avoiding the network of holes and tunnels like they were bottomless pits. With enough glaring from Paul, Michael followed in as well.



I moved away, stepping into the van and shutting the sliding door, locking it tight save for the gaps in the windows. I settled myself in the coolest part of the vehicle and pulled out my game again, escaping into a network of caves a lot safer to explore.



Hours passed. The sun made its way down and soon the dense treeline blocked it, turning the front of the mansion into a dark cavern. I hadn’t even so much as seen anyone in the windows. Whatever noise that might have been coming from the mansion was probably absorbed by the garbage cramming every open space within.



Even a cherished game couldn’t keep away what was gnawing at my insides.



I stepped out, DS in my grip as I walked up to the front doors. I had the keys in my pocket, but no cell phone. I pulled out the cartridge from the DS, fumbling it between my fingers to distract myself. My brother had left his flip phone behind with me, but it was now dead. I looked inside the mansion. “Hey, Paul?” I called out. “Arnold? Heather? Anyone?” I didn’t call for Michael.



Nothing answered me from that overstuffed foyer. I gulped as I stepped back, trying to work through it. Should I leave? I couldn’t drive but I could walk. No, it was miles to the next place that might even have anyone there. I stepped back, returning to the van and grabbing the tire iron Arnold kept in the trunk, still fidgeting with the cartridge in my other hand. The small chunk of metal felt more comforting than one of my teddy bears in the failing light. Maybe I could walk to the nearest retreat center and–



Something knocked the cartridge out of my hands.



I yelped and looked to the side to see a large gray cat running away, the chunk of plastic in its mouth as it darted around the side of the mansion. “Hey!” I called out, chasing after it. “Give that back, you stupid cat!” I picked my way around the fallen roof shingles like they were pressure plates in some trap-filled temple, rounding the corner in search of the flea-ridden thief. There he sat a couple dozen feet away, still holding the cartridge in his teeth. He meowed at me.



“Why, you–” I hissed, charging at him before he took off again, leading me further about the side of the mansion. Soon I was around the back, chasing the literal cat burglar over a fallen section of wrought-iron fence into what had once been a garden, now just a mire of weeds complete with a fountain that had devolved into an algae-filled mosquito farm. The cat stopped in front of a boarded-up back door and put the game on the ground.



“Why’d you do that?” I snapped, catching up to the furball. He meowed again before backing away. I could see a faded collar around his neck as I grabbed the cartridge, pocketing it. “If you don’t mind, cat, I need to–”



Metallic crunching, shattering, snapping shot out from the front of the mansion. I yelped a little, gripping the tire iron as I started my way around the building again, taking my shaking steps with a lot more care and patience. The cat followed me, meowing the entire way as if telling me not to listen to my curiosity. I stopped at the final bend and peeked around the corner.



Arnold’s van had vanished. Not like it had been stolen; I saw bits and pieces of it scattered everywhere. Shards of glass, tiny scraps of metal, a lone tire that had been ripped to tatters. The rest of the van, contents included, had disappeared, leaving nothing but a trail of oil and other fluids to the front doors of the mansion, and as I tried to process this I heard a shifting and groaning escape from one of the nearby broken windows. A constant shuffle, followed by stamps of feet and then heavy breathing. Only a few feet above me. I pressed myself against the side of the house in case somebody was looking out, trusting my goosebumps instead of the hope it was my brother searching for me.



“I’ve gotta get out of here,” I said to myself. “Bye, cat. Thank you for whatever that was but I have to leave. I need to find someone, gotta call someone, I don’t… I don’t…” I ran my free hand through my hair, trying to parse through it all. “My… my brother’s in there. With whoever did that. How did they do that? What am I supposed to do?” I started backing around toward the front of the mansion, lost in thought even as the cat yelled at me, trying to break me out of my panic by biting at my heels. I misplaced a step on a shingle, shattering it and feeling something give underneath.



As it did, the whole world fell around me.



\* \* \* \* \*



I came to in darkness, aches blanketing my body. I groaned as I pulled myself up, reaching into my pocket and pulling out the DS to serve as a flashlight. I had fallen through a rotten section of flooring, hidden by fallen shingles and overgrowth. A cellar entrance? A cellar entrance so high up I couldn’t climb out, leaving me on top of a massive mound of rotting, pulpy mess that had once been newspapers. So many newspapers. So many I could barely sit up in this chamber.



I heard a meow up above me and brought my light up, the glow reflecting off the eyes of the cat. He looked over to his right and then back to me before meowing again. Done relaying whatever his message was, he took off.



I gulped, looking across the cellar. I spotted the doorway out, kept open by the massive piles of trash that climbed up the staircase into the main building. I felt even smaller than before, a stringy bit of meat trapped within the depths of the colossal monster that had swallowed my brother and his friends whole, and me about to get ground to paste between its teeth. I forced my hands forward and started crawling across the garbage, testing each step in case the decaying detritus was about to give beneath me, all while hoping the black splotches I saw everywhere wouldn’t affect me unless I was down here for a while.



Something collapsed in on itself in the corner of the cellar to my left. I shined the light over, taking in the overflowing shelves nearly consumed by the floor of trash, discarded bones, desiccated remains of what had probably been raccoons and other vagrant animals moving in. One in particular looked pale and bald as if all the hair had been plucked out. Just past it, I saw what looked like the disassembled remnants of a motor, leaking and dripping fluids onto the trash around it, as well as some sort of preserved animal in a jar.



A shuffling. I looked back at the source; the bald remains were gone. And in the dead silence, I felt something moving underneath the garbage.



I turned and crawled toward the stairs, my light going back and forth as I tried to watch for movements in the trash, doing what I could to keep an eye on all the holes in the compacted detritus. A shuffling again, close to the surface on my right. I shot the light over and saw two twisted, mangled feet vanish down a hole. They had been so bent and broken they intertwined with each other, fusing into a single mess of flesh like a tail.



I covered my mouth, trying to steady my breaths. The shuffling came back again beneath me and I tried to watch the holes as I kept moving. Finally I got to the slope of the staircase, my light revealing the hallway ahead, barely visible as the garbage went nearly to the ceiling. I turned away from the cellar and fully laid down on my stomach to squirm into the hallway.



A raspy shriek broke through the air as I felt something grab my ankles.



I couldn’t stop letting out a scream as something dragged me back down into the cellar. I kicked and writhed, breaking one leg free and twisting around, shining my light on what had grabbed me. Two gnarled, filth-encrusted hands had burst through a section of moldy newspaper, clamping tight on my ankles as they pulled me into the new hole it had created, a hole far too tight for me to fit down without a lot of force. I let out another shriek as I kicked with my free foot, hitting the wrist of the other hand and getting loose. I crawled away but the rumbling returned below as something moved underneath, traversing the network of tunnels with the ease of a mole. Hands shot out to my side, grabbing my left arm and dragging it into another gap. I screamed and brought the tire iron down on the fingers, shattering them like twigs and freeing me again. I grabbed the DS where it had fallen and hurled myself up the stairs, squeezing through the gap faster than I thought possible and emerging out into the top of the hallway.



The trash sifted below me and I heard the shuffling once more. Then more. And more. I flailed my way over the garbage, the roof now high enough for me to stand up. I ran from the noises as they come from what had to be the front of the mansion, hoping the next reckless step didn’t send my leg into a hidden hole and snap it in two before more of those hands grabbed me and pulled me in. I’d have taken an entire field of prairie dog burrows over this.



I emerged into a dining room and before me hung a colossal chandelier still attached to the ceiling by a thick chain. I climbed onto it, praying it could still support my weight so I could get off the ground. It held firm, just in time before more hands burst out like twisted weeds, grasping at where I had just been. I shivered as the grime-covered, blackened limbs disappeared beneath layers of rotting strips of blankets.



I scanned around, barely seeing movement in the corners of my eyes. They sifted through the mountains of garbage like swimming through water, bathing in the slimy filth and navigating the tunnels with ease. I aimed the light below and saw multiple eyes looking at me through the gaps. Human eyes, bloodshot, cataracts eating at portions of them as they regarded me. Raspy voices hissing and growling. I could only whimper as they circled me.



I tried the breaths again, bringing my heart rate down as they trapped me. They kept themselves hidden, only the sounds of their movement giving away their presence. I looked away from the things, glancing around the ceiling and spotting a broken section about ten feet away; a place where the ceiling had caved in, exposing an entrance to the second floor. Beneath it was the top of a china cabinet that looked sturdy enough to support me. Had Paul managed to get up there like he said?



I shuffled the light and tire iron into one hand before pulling out Arnold’s keys with the other. I threw them opposite of me, the keys smashing into an empty picture frame. The rasps cut off and I felt the eyes leave me and focus on the keys. All the forms bolted, digging through the trash toward the distraction as I launched off the chandelier. I pulled myself onto the cabinet and turned back to give a final glance.



A human face emerged from the rubble, a twisted arm with far too many joints bringing the warped hand holding the keys next to its ruined eyes. The entire skull had been mashed and malformed, pushed into a streamlined shape more like a beak than a person’s face. The broken teeth jutted out like a horse, the nose smashed in, eyes not meeting at the same level above. I could just see its shoulders pressed far too close in to each other, and only a few strands of hair dangled around its head. It hissed at me and again I felt eyes gazing up at me from their hiding spots in the trash.



I turned away and didn’t look back as I grabbed at the floor above. Trash covered this room as well, a wall of ruined toys, playthings, movie posters and outdated electronics that looked like they were made of wood. I pocketed my light and used the junk to hold on as I climbed, the rasping and hissing closing in below me. I felt something brush against my foot a second before I pulled it up, removing all of myself from the dining room and into this new chamber.



Shuttered windows lined the wall, letting in precious moonlight through their broken slats. I freed myself from the hole, gasping for air, my own pulse drowning out the noise those things made from downstairs. I lay on the cleanest section of the sea of junk I could find, an old moldy blanket mixed with ravaged comic books. I kept my crying down as best I could as I listened. Hopefully it would take them a while to reach me. I held onto myself, trying to stifle my whimpers. I just wanted my brother back. Anything else… please, just let him be okay.



Then I heard another whimper. A gurgled weeping from a connecting room. I forced myself up, hands slipping as grime coated every part of me. I stood, stooped over to avoid the splintered, peeling ceiling as I walked to the source of the noise. I entered what looked to have once been a bathroom adjoining two bedrooms. Empty bottles of shampoo, boxes of soap and mountains of spent beauty products had been stuffed so tight they had compacted into a hardened layer, with everything from loofahs to old towels filling the gaps. And in a corner, possibly where a bathtub or shower had long since been covered, the whimpers erupted from a dip in the sea of trash.



I stepped closer and gasped. It was Susan, covered in blood, curled in a corner of the bathroom like an animal hiding itself in its last moments. And from what I could see… maybe these were hers, judging the blood covering her. “Hey!” I hissed, scrambling over to her. What could I even do besides be there for her? “What happened? Did those… things do this to you?”



Her eyes focused for a moment, all her remaining energy going to turn her head to me. As I closed in I could see where the blood came from: a deep, twisted wound in her stomach that she had tried to plug, but now it was far too late. My light illuminated the trail of blood that wound its way to her from the other bedroom. “Get out of here,” she gasped.



“Where’s Paul?” I asked her, getting onto my knees before her, hands clasped as if in prayer. “I’m so sorry I can’t do anything to you. But please, help me find my brother.”



“We were in the halls when the hoarders came,” she said, breaths labored and ragged. “Paul ran off to draw them away. I got turned around. I saw what I thought was him.”



“And it was one of them?”



She released a hand from her stomach and grabbed my wrist, blood smearing with the filth on me. “It was Michael,” she hissed. “Stupid asshole thought I was one of them. Stabbed me and left me to die.” She spat up blood. “Get out of here. Keep away from Michael. Your brother wouldn’t–”



She stopped when a shuffling erupted from the bedroom she had come from. “Get out, now!” she snapped, pushing me away as tremors moved through the garbage beneath us. I just managed to crawl backwards enough before the hands shot out of the junk around the poor girl, grabbing her head, her shoulders, her arms. The face of one of the monsters burst out from the trash, bringing its twisted, malformed body up above her.



It hissed as it looked down at its captive, drool escaping its misshapen mouth as it dug its filthy digits into her face. God, how could it even live with its chest so smashed, rolled like clay into a shape that had to have broken all of its ribs? Shredded strips of clothing clung to its body, held together with a patchwork of pins, suggesting something like what my grandma had worn in the fifty’s. Rings blanketed its fingers, everything from gold wedding bands to those cheap things you win out of vending machines at the grocery store.



Susan barely managed to scream before the hoarder dragged her headfirst into the hole it had made. Or rather, tried to; the hole that it had managed to fit through wasn’t nearly big enough to accommodate its prey. But that didn’t stop it. Even as she fought with what little strength she had left it continued pulling her, bit by bit working her upper body into the hole. Her muffled screams escaped through the gaps accompanied by sharp snaps of bone while more of her disappeared from sight. Her screams kept going, well past the point they should have stopped until it was just her legs dangling in the air. Only then did she finally fall silent, her feet forced together and pulled in with a quick tug, the tight squeeze twisting her broken limbs around each other.



By then I had made my way back to the other room and turned around, hauling myself out the other door into the hallway. The trash was low enough for me to stand back up fully and I hurled my body as far from that monster feasting on the poor girl as I could. I rounded a corner, guessing at whatever might be the right direction to go. Everything looked the same, the walls devoid of any decoration and any furniture that had once been present long since buried by junk. The path I chose ended in a wall and I turned around, spotting a door into another room. This one wasn’t half as full as the others, the trash sloping downward and ending in a bundle of blankets, pillows and sheets like a nest. Within that nest sat Heather, eyes glued to her phone as she pushed away at the buttons, hammering out commands on the number pad.



“Come on, get through,” she sputtered as she shook. “Come on! How is there no signal? There was a signal outside!” She tried again. “How could there be so much stuff you can’t even send out a text?” Again. This time it was a call. Still nothing. “Come on! Please!”



“Heather!” I said. “Come on! We gotta leave! Where’s Paul?”



She kept pounding at the keypad. “Paul lured them away but it’s not enough,” she whimpered, still glued to her screen. “They won’t let us escape. They got Arnold. Pulled him into one of their tunnels when he tried to stop them from taking us; snapped his bones like twigs. We broke into their home. They just wanted to be left alone. They just wanted to add to their collections.” She screamed when her phone failed her again. “We can’t escape!”



“We can,” I said, trying to convince myself more than her. “Please. Where’s Paul? How do we get back to the front door?”



She gave up, tossing the phone away before looking at me, giving me the same worn-down look I’ve seen my parents give the door-to-door political campaign volunteers pushing policies they hated. “The door back to the foyer is across from us,” she said. “No point. They have us trapped. All we can do is hope one of those texts actually got through and someone burns this place to the ground.” In the light of my DS I could see the streaks left through the filth on her face by her tears. Her eyes turned away from me, looking at something visible only to her. “I’m sorry, daddy. I’m really sorry I didn’t listen. I’m so sorry I went behind your back.”



I turned around, moving back up the slope of garbage. I had to keep looking. I had to leave her behind. I grabbed her cell phone as I passed it, made my way to the doorway and felt that sensation again. This time a single shuffling beneath me, passing underneath, moving toward her. I turned around. “Heather!” I hissed. “You gotta get moving! Now!”



“I’m sorry, mom,” she kept spitting out. “I’m sorry, daddy. I’m so sorry.”



The blankets before her parted, and from my viewpoint I could see another one of the hoarders emerge from its tunnel, this one large and muscular even with its twisted, broken form. Brown hair still adorned its scalp but fell out in clumps, its arms moving in animated motion as it growled and gurgled. “Heeaattthhherr…” it somehow managed through its smashed mouth full of broken, misplaced teeth. “Heeaatthhherr, dooo youuu liiike?”



Heather broke out of her daze long enough to let out another scream before the hoarder fell on her. I didn’t stay to look.



I heard more shuffling close in from the corridors around me, and even in the distance I could see shapes moving. Eyes popping out through open sections of garbage, hands breaking free just to return back down. Two legs vanishing back underneath the filth, intertwined upon themselves, twisted by the contortions required to navigate the tunnels. I darted to the doorway Heather had mentioned and finally saw moonlight spilling ahead of me, turning around one last time to see a hoarder fully emerge from the junk, using its twisted arms to scurry at me like an insect while it let out a feral cry. Without thinking I grabbed the tire iron and threw it at him, my weapon falling a few inches short. He came to a stop before it, grabbing the tire iron and regarding it, then me.



I kept going, letting myself roll and slide down the garbage-covered staircase. Every last sharp edge, broken bit of glass, splintered stick of wood and rusty spike of metal grabbed and tore at me as I fell, but still I let myself. I could hear them as they tunneled their way around on the second floor. I could even hear some moving about on the ground level in rooms I hadn’t looked in. Let them. They could have this entire house. Just please. Let me leave. Give me back my brother.



Salvation emerged before me as I finally escaped the mountains of trash and landed on the floor, my feet touching actual tiles for the first time in what felt like a year. I pulled myself back up, hobbling over to the entryway even as I heard the monsters moving behind me, congregating as one. They remained at the edges of their trash, ruined eyes looking at me, broken mouths emerging to hiss and cry out at the girl escaping them. They watched me as I crossed the threshold and emerged outside, me bearing nothing but my own clothes and the contents of my pockets.



Then I felt two large arms wrap around me, a giant, filthy hand clasping over my mouth. “Thank goodness you’re safe, Sheela,” said the last voice I wanted to hear. “Sorry about your brother. It’s okay, though. I made it, too. We’ll get out of here together, okay? Just stay with me. I’ll take care of you.”



I screamed as I tried to force my way free from Michael’s grip, but the disgusting giant held firm. “Now, is that any way to thank the boy who’s going to protect you?” he hissed. “Girls are all the same. Do the nicest things for them and they don’t appreciate it at all. Well, your brother isn’t here now to get between us, is he? And those freaks won’t leave the house for us. They just want junk.”



I moved my mouth enough to bite down on his hand, digging my teeth in and tasting his blood mixed with the grime that covered us both. He let out a cry and loosened his grip just enough to let me go, but with everything I had been through I fell to the ground, the world spinning around me. I tried to crawl toward the road, hoping the downward slope would be enough to roll me away from him.



Something grabbed both of my feet, dragging me back toward damnation. I kicked, breaking free one leg and letting me turn onto my back, staring into the face of a sickening monster as it loomed over me.



“Get away from me!” I cried. “You’re a murderer!”



“Knew I should have put her our of her misery,” growled Michael. “But don’t worry, since we’re safe now, if you keep quiet about all this I’ll let you live, okay?” He looked ready to bring himself down on me like a wolf onto a cornered rabbit.



But before he could something leapt onto his back from the doorway, its gnarled fingers scrabbling at his clothes and digging into his exposed flesh. He fell backwards, throttled by the hoarder as it clawed at him with its broken digits, both monsters howling as they fought. Michael pulled a knife from his side, but before he could bring it against his opponent another hoarder burst from the garbage and out the door, grabbing at the weapon and breaking his arm at the elbow with a loud crack. A third hoarder erupted into the fray, grabbing Michael’s remaining arm, pulling it away from his opponent and snapping his fingers like twigs.



The original hoarder, covered in fresh blood, its mangled limbs and form seeming unhealed compared to the others, its hair still dropping in clumps, loomed on the chest of its target. And before Michael could let out another scream, it shot its hands forward and shoved its filthy thumbs into his eyes while the other two dragged him back into the mansion. The doors slammed shut behind them.



No more trespassers.



I somehow found the energy to get back up, free from the foul, dark, rotting carcass of a mansion and embraced by the warm moonlight of the woods around me. I hobbled ahead, reaching the road where it turned away from the mansion before finally collapsing onto the grass nearby.



I tried to get back up, but my legs wouldn’t budge. I could only weep, even my cries barely audible in the noise of the woods around me. I pulled myself together enough to pull out Heather’s cell phone, the marathon of failed texts and calls on the screen. But now a bar was present in the top-right. As worn as I was, my fingers had enough for one last thing before I fell unconscious.



\* \* \* \* \*



They never found Paul. Or any of the others. I told my parents and the cops that they had vanished into the mansion. I had fallen in through the cellar and had barely managed to get out. They tried to search the mansion, but after weeks of trying to pull out garbage and failing to make any progress something happened – my parents never told me what – and they just gave up. Wrote them all off like they had been lost in a caving accident, the mansion their tomb. They left that place on the hill be, no one wanting to have to deal with it. No developers offered to buy it. They just closed off the road.



After I recovered, both from my wounds and the loss, I started receiving gifts in the mail. Game cartridges. Rare ones. Many were covered in filth and grime, but most worked. They came at random, with no return address, but I knew where they had come from.



And on my eighteenth birthday, a deed and a contract came in the mail. This one did have a return address, an outdated one that matched the mansion from all those years ago.



The contract was simple: I would inherit the land and property on it, all fees and taxes paid for by strips of highway land used for billboards. But, I had to live there. A small guest house had apparently appeared at the beginning of the driveway up to the mansion. So long as I lived there, maintaining my vigil over Hoarder’s Hill, I was free to stay. To come and go as I pleased, unlike the rest of the collections in the mansion.



I’ve been there since, making my rounds up to visit, to bring them the things of mine I no longer wanted but they might have interest in. They never refused any of it. They would often even take my trash and recyclables before Friday pickup. There must have been a network of caves throughout that hill, connecting all the abandoned homes to the mansion. They took what no one else wanted, and I made sure to stay out of their way.



Even twenty years after I stepped into that mansion it’s not an easy peace, but if me being there keeps other foolish kids from breaking into their home, it’s all for the better. They let me see them and live, and in the dead of night they gift me things they think I’ll like. They aren’t hurt if I don’t want it.



Though one in particular always gives me what I enjoy. He will come up to the house before morning and leave his offering at my doorstep, never staying. I see him in the window as he comes and goes sometimes, and I’m just glad that Paul is still looking out for me.
