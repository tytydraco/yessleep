"Ladies and gentlemen, for your safety, the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign. We are approaching a bit of weather and the plane will likely experience some turbulence. All passengers please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts. We will turn off the fasten seatbelt sign once the captain has confirmed it is once again safe to roam about the cabin. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your cooperation. Flight attendants please return to your stations."

On cue, the plane shuddered as it hit a patch of rough air. I shut my eyes and instinctively gripped the armrests of my seat. Flying 500 miles per hour in a big metal tube 30,000 feet in the air with strangers was nerve-wracking enough... and now the big metal tube is going to start shaking. My phone- my only real source of distraction- had died half an hour prior and I left my charger in my checked bag. I leaned back, exhaled slowly through my nose, and downed the rest of my $14 airplane cup of wine- hoping that it and the one before it would kick in before the turbulence did.

I never liked flying. Every time I find myself in the seat of an airplane, my lizard brain takes control of me. Any bump or slight tilt sends bursts of fear through my body. I tense up and convince myself that these will be my final moments, waiting in terror for the plane to plummet to the ground, killing everyone on board in a fiery explosion. I found that a few drinks usually help to ease that tension.

I watched as other passengers begrudgingly buckled their seatbelts. The old woman in the aisle seat next to me decided this was the best time to make a break for the bathroom, much to the dismay of the flight attendants. She managed to convince them to let her go by saying "if you don't let me go now, the plane will shake it out of me in my seat!" I regret to say that for my own sake, I was happy to see her go.

I glanced out the window from the middle seat, over the man next to me watching "When Harry Met Sally," and saw that the plane was indeed approaching some thick white clouds. We were flying over a sea of endless forest and farmland, which made the clouds seem all the more intimidating. The PA system continued to chime every few minutes, indicating that the turbulence was only going to get worse.

The plane began to rattle gently as it approached the clouds, like a school bus driving along an old gravel road. The baby in the seat in front of me continued to babble and chew on her fingers in her mother's lap. I smiled- she was cute in her little pink onesie, and it helped to know that if a baby can handle a little turbulence, then so can I. I straightened up in my chair and looked around for ways to distract myself.

I tried reading Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan's lips for a while, but I kept catching myself stealing glaces at the clouds. Coasting alongside them gave me a true feel for their immense size. They dwarfed the 737 passenger plane, taking almost a full minute to fly past each one. I have to admit, despite my fear of flying, I always appreciated seeing clouds like those from their vantage point. They carried an intense feeling of beauty and awe that you just don't get when observing them from the ground. It looks and feels like you've entered another world entirely. One that exists out of sight, high in the sky. One that humans were never supposed to lay eyes upon.

My pleasant daydreaming about clouds was cut short as we began to fly through one. It started gradually, blowing past hazy tufts that briefly blocked the view. As we progressed, the windows quickly became obscured by a dense off-white mist that swallowed the plane whole. In seconds, there was nothing visible past the wing. The cabin began to rattle more intensely, rocking from side to side. More than once, the plane jolted up and down, giving me that awful stomach-dropping feeling. The thick cloud taunted the plane, punishing us for disturbing its peace. I closed my eyes and dug my fingers into the leathery cushion of the seat. I hadn't realized until then how cold it was in the cabin- had it always been that cold? I opened one eye and with a shaky hand, reached up to twist the air nozzle. I twisted it one way, then the other, but felt no change in temperature.

As I nervously fiddled with the air, the plane veered sharply without warning. Several passengers exclaimed in shock as the plane nearly went vertical. Luggage shoved up against the walls of the overhead bins. An industrial groan released as the plane swerved into what felt like a downward spiral. I sunk into my chair and tightened my grip on the armrests. I squeezed my eyes shut, praying for it to be over. It wasn't before what felt like an entire minute that the plane eventually righted itself. The droning sound persisted; it maintained its tone but grew softer, like a distant train blaring it's horn. It faded away as the plane exited the cloud- the apparent goal of the pilot's aggressive action. I kept my eyes shut and struggled to find my breath through the next announcement.

"Once again ladies and gentlemen for the safety of yourself and other passengers we do ask that you remain seated while we get through this bit of weather here. Apologies in advance for any other... evasive maneuvers. Shouldn't be too long before we hit clear skies once again. In the meantime folks just keep those seatbelts fastened and enjoy the view. Flight attendants please be seated at your stations and fasten your seatbelts. Thank you."

Evasive maneuvers? Anxious thoughts raced through my head as I caught my breath. Eventually I did manage to settle down and open my eyes, catching the man next to me awkwardly shift his gaze away from me.Â 

I noticed the other passengers pointing and gawking out their windows. The baby's mother held her up to the window so she could see. Naturally, I joined in and looked out my row's window. It was unlike anything I had ever witnessed before.

There were many, many more clouds. Different clouds.

They were enormous, over triple the size of the cloud we had just flown out of. They were far away from the plane, but their sheer size made them feel so close. It's honestly difficult to truly recall how massive they were. From my view in the middle seat, they appeared to stretch for miles ahead, as well as down underneath the plane and high into the sky. Beams of sunlight cut through thin cracks in the white walls, casting ominous shadows and creating deep, unexplorable caverns.

In addition to their size, the clouds moved. I'd seen clouds move before, but never as these ones did. Their motion was slow yet... intentional. Individual clouds followed individual paths. Up, down, sideways... systematically. Some rotated as they meandered through the sky, like massive gears with puffy cogs powering an immense airborne machine. Some appeared to alter their course toward the plane, as if to investigate their uninvited guest. I and the other passengers watched in admiration as we soared through what could only be described as heaven.

I was so mesmerized by the cloudscape that I hardly noticed when the plane began to shake once again. It was the misty gray tufts that brought me back to reality- we were beginning to fly through another cloud. It looked like a thundercloud, though it never manifested like the first one did. Instead, small wisps of fog flew past the windows like a flock of ghostly gray birds.

As we pressed through, the dark clouds made their presence known. It started small, with an occasional bounce or dip in the plane's course. It picked up quickly, as if many more clouds decided to join in. Strong jolts bombarded the wings and hull, sending loud thuds and bumps across the thin walls. Lights began to flicker as the plane struggled through the air. Waves of anxiety poured over me as I felt every cloud send ruptures through the cabin. I squeezed my eyes shut through the barrage. I heard passengers panic, letting out nervous cries.

"What the hell is going on out there??"

"Oh my God look at the wing!"

I caught brief glimpses out the window. The wing of the plane flailed up and down, threatening to snap at any second. The misty figures were beginning to take stronger shapes, becoming clearer as individual forms. They were picking up speed alongside the plane. We were being pursued.

The baby began to cry as the plane shook violently. Her mother did her best to comfort her as the leaden clouds started to surround the hull. I heard passengers shout across the plane in frightened confusion.

"Holy shit what are those??"

"Daddy I'm scared!"

"Honey? Honey look at me... Mike stop... Stop it you're scaring me! Mike look at me!!"

I could only listen in horror; my eyelids refused to open as the plane thrashed through the sky. Over several agonizing minutes, the terrified screams began to fade. Soon the only sound came from the baby; she wailed for her mother who was no longer comforting her. Something was wrong.

I forced my eyes open. The mother's body was rigid, her neck craned toward the window. Her breath was rapid but shallow, like she was having an asthma attack. Her husband next to her shared her affliction. I quickly turned to look at the man next to me. His face was nearly pressed against the window, his quick breath creating a small circle of condensation against the plastic. His eyes twitched in their sockets, unnaturally wide and sickeningly bloodshot, locked in a horrified stare out the window. I followed his gaze and caught my first glimpse outside since the dark clouds arrived.

They had changed.

Their gray appearance had deepened to an inky black; the darkest black I'd ever seen. They were mere feet from the plane; hundreds of vantablack voids peppered against an ivory backdrop. Misty limbs like tentacles extended from their centers- hypnotically waving through the air. The moment I looked, my gaze was fixed. The ghostly tendrils crept toward the window, leaking through the narrow seams and into the plane. I could only scream as they reformed and reached toward my face, my neck straining against an invisible force. A wet squish filled my ears as they pushed my eyes deep into my skull, casting my vision into a dense black fog.Â 

I felt my body try to shut it out, to close my eyes, to look away. The fog began to materialize, hardening into a colossal black wall. Millions of specks of white light flew past my gaze before disappearing into the unseen horizon, a final farewell before I was plunged into complete nothingness.

...

Time passed... impossible for me now to remember how much.

I don't remember how long it took for me to notice... anything. Vague hums and shrill muted whines filled an otherwise empty expanse. A near imperceptible breeze served as the only indicator of movement as I stared into a black abyss.

I convinced myself that I was dead, and that this was the afterlife. An eternity flying through an endless dark chasm. I wanted to scream, to cry, to hear my own voice. I couldn't. I was reduced to a consciousness, separated from flesh, unable to move or speak.Â 

More time passed.

Masses of color slowly emerged from the far reaches of the void, confronting the darkness with faint, dull light. Without eyes I bore witness to everything, my soul at the center of the great display. The pulsating colors revealed a depth and dimension to my purgatory as they intensified. Vivid fusions of reds, yellows, and greens gently flashed like celestial bodies in a greater galaxy, extending infinitely in all directions. The world itself shifted it's layers to pave my path through.

Suddenly my movement ceased. I was left hovering before an immense canvas of meandering color. Thick, murky shadows leaked into existence from the empty dark patches. They pinched off and bobbed through space, spinning and multiplying rapidly like cells under a microscope. Legions of dark anomalies presented themselves before me.

In grand unison, they slowly collapsed into their own orbits, mitigating themselves into mere specks before exploding outward into enormous bright streaks of light. Gleaming tendrils slowly bore through space with angelic beauty; the unearthly noises intensified as they formed their paths. Lavish, nameless colors continued to pulse brightly behind them, their influence refracted tenfold through the lustrous coils. They curled and twisted at unfathomable angles, methodically weaving warped patterns and impossible geometric figures. Ones with inhuman intricacy and elegance. True, salient meaning conveyed in every movement, every intersection, every end of every line.

A message. Carved into space itself. I saw it. I understood...

In an instant, the images were ripped from my mind as the misty limbs retracted out of my eye sockets. I was hurled back into consciousness on the plane, my eyes on fire as a familiar drone filled the air. The black voids darted away, as if spooked by the returning sound of the train horn. It rang much louder than before. Much closer. The other passengers slumped in their seats; their bloodshot eyes remained wide and unblinking.

I had little time to process. A jarring crash struck the plane from below; my head nearly bashed into the seat in front of me. Mechanical blasts permeated through the cabin walls, growing louder, becoming many train horns blaring in unison. Like a choir of synthetic singers, all performing unique songs in conflicting tones. A cold wave of fear shot down my spine as the plane began to angle backwards. I was forced down into my seat as it accelerated. We were flying higher into the air.

With splintering cracks, the windows began to shatter. Pressurized air poured out of the plane. My ears popped. Suitcases flew out of their overhead bins, crashing down onto the floor and unresponsive passengers. The powerful sound resonated from all angles, filling my head and vibrating through my bones. White fog began to pour through the windows, shrouding the cabin in thick plumes. I watched the slumped body of the man next to me disappear from view as he was consumed. The fog quickly enveloped me like a wet blanket, filling my mouth as I screamed. It entered my lungs. My breath cut short. My vision blurred. The otherworldly bellowing reached its resounding peak.

The last thing I remembered before I passed out was a final announcement from the PA system. The voice was not the pilot's nor the flight attendant's. It was faint and monotone, though it pierced through the havoc. Millions of strained whispers vocalizing in unison. Long tones filled every empty space in my body. Every word burrowed deep into my mind.

The plane touched down on the tarmac with a jolt. I sprang awake, crying out and gasping loudly. My eyes darted around the cabin, but all I saw were annoyed and confused faces staring back at me. The plane was in typical condition- carry on bags stowed away, passengers healthy and in their seats. Nothing was out of place.Â 

I sat forward in my seat, struggling to find my breath. The harrowing events of the flight still at the front of my mind. I could hear the intense droning in the back of my skull. The powerful symbols flashed through my brain. A sudden hand on my shoulder made me jump.

"Hey buddy, you alright?" asked the man in the window seat.Â 

I turned quickly to look at him, startling him. I stared into his eyes; they looked entirely normal, albeit a little tired. He had dark bags under his eyelids, as though he hadn't slept well in a while.

"I-I.. y-you were- those things... you're okay?" I stammered, still reeling.

"Me? Uhh yeah I'm fine... rough flight, but I must've fallen asleep at some point. Missed the back half of my movie..."

The man began to check his phone, and I managed to catch the time. 8:26pm... only 11 minutes later than our scheduled arrival time.

The plane came to a stop at the gate. People immediately began to stand up out of their seats, hastily grabbing their bags and murmuring amongst themselves. No one was at all shaken or injured as they should have been.

"Alrighty folks the plane has come to a complete stop and we'll be opening the doors to let you all out shortly.Â  Once again we apologize for that short delay, and thank you all for your cooperation. Please make sure you have all of your belongings before deplaning. On behalf of the entire crew, I'd like to thank you all for flying with us this evening, and we'll see you on your next trip!"

I was beginning to accept that I had experienced a terrible nightmare. One manifested by fear, turbulence, and a bit of airplane wine. I was beginning to stand when I heard a small voice.

"Mommy, when is it our turn to leave?"

"Very soon sweetie, very soon"

My face fell in shock. I turned sharply toward the window seat in front of me. Looking back at me was a little girl, aged about 3, sitting in her mother's lap, wearing a pink onesie. It looked to be several sizes too small. My eyes widened in shock. I was about to question her and her mother when a shrill scream erupted from the rear of the cabin. It was followed by a cluttered thud as something fell to the cabin floor. I was close enough to look behind and see before passengers began their panicked rush out of the plane.Â 

Lying outside the bathroom door was the decaying corpse of an old woman. Her stringy black hair fell into her slacked open jaw. Her shriveled eyes were sunken unnaturally deep into her skull.Â 

It was the corpse of a woman who had long been trapped in that bathroom.

...

News stories after the flight covered the "elderly woman found dead in an airplane bathroom," but that was the extent. They left out the fact that she looked to have been rotting for months. Nothing either about unexplainable experiences from passengers or babies aging 2 years in a 5 hour flight. I was never able to confront the mother and child- they had rushed out of the plane along with the rest of the passengers.Â 

That flight was three days ago, but it's all I can think about. Everything becomes... cloudy... when I try to put it all together in my mind. I thought writing everything out here would give me some clarity, but it's only deepened my confusion. The only thing I'm certain of is that something left its mark on me.

I can't purge the immaculate streaks of light from my mind. I see them every time I close my eyes- as if they were etched into the back of my eyelids. The symbols they created were unlike any I'd ever seen before. They weren't like any letter or number. They were too precise, had too much depth... carried too much weight. They made perfect sense when I saw them in my "fugue state," but they've become an enigma ever since. A vast mural of indescribable shapes and lines.

There's a message in that madness. A message that holds a truth. A message that someone wanted to show us... and that someone else wanted to keep hidden. Written in a language that we aren't ready to understand.

No one else remembers, but I do. I'm going to find it. I have to find it.
