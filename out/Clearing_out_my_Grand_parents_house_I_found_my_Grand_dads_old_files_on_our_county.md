Let me say that the last couple of days have been anything but easy for me and the rest of my family. My grandfather, as of last weekend, has passed away after a long and drawn-out battle with cancer. And while I feel grief's heavy and mournful grasp tighten and mute the world around me. I take some solace in the fact that I no longer half to watch his body once so jovial and brimming with vitality become withered and worn by that damned disease. Helping my parents clean out my Grandparents' old house has been anything but a warm trip down memory lane and more a cold reminder of what had been spirited away. It has also been an avenue for some odd discoveries, though, namely the files I mentioned in the title of this post.

Now, my grandfather having these records didn't shock me or my father in the slightest. Granddad had always been an avid local historian and self-titled truth seeker since his days as a radio broadcaster. Spending a majority of his golden years working and helping collaborate with the local historical society. What was odd was that these had not been donated, unlike the others. Instead, these were kept in a small shelf in a room in his basement, all labeled in the same format of "Languid Files asst.". What made it stranger was that these were not dated. Grandpa Malcolm had a lot of quirks, and Grandma and Dad always had suspicions that he was a bit of a hoarder, but he was never disorganized. 

" What do you think we should do with these, Dad?" He stood in silence for a bit, rubbing his chin in deep thought as he stared at the trove of documents we just uncovered. "Don't know, but dad wouldn't have kept these if he didn't have a reason, so we might as well hang on to them."

"Dooo you mind if I take a look at these?" I looked up at him with hope in my eyes. He shrugged. "Sure. Knock yourself out. We're pretty much done with most of the heavy lifting, and we're going to take a break anyway. Just bring these up when you're done."

"You got it." We smiled at each other as he walked out of the room and went up the stairs, leaving me alone with the small shelf full of documents. I figured I'd start with the ones furthest to my left. I figured even if they were not labeled, Gramps probably instinctively put them in some loose order before getting deep into the weeds of what should go where. I pulled out the furthest left box on the top shelf and pulled out the first document and... It wasn't what I was expecting in the slightest. 

The first was an old local newspaper from the "Languid Gazette" on a name I recognised, but a story I'd never heard about. "Local man Murton T. Riley Attacked by Savage Beast." At first, I thought it was referring to the famous story where old Mr. Riley took down a bear that charged him with just one shot, but... as I read further, the more apparent it became that that wasn't the case. 

The Article read as follows: 

Local man, Murton T Riley, reports a shocking encounter with a beast that he can only describe as "ungodly". Riley claims that on August 3rd, 1959, he had taken his camera up Rocky-Step Trail to take some photos of the local vegetation and fauna when he heard a "great commotion" occurring from the bottom of the steep hill that ran adjacent to the hiking trail. When he peered over to see what was the cause of the commotion, he heard. He saw what at first he believed to be two male bears locked in a heated territorial dispute. Riley notes that he was immediately wary and made uneasy by the coloration of the larger bear, as unlike its brown counterpart, its fur was coal black with eerie yellow eyes. He also made note that the comparatively smaller brown bear was seemingly trying to  "limp away after taking heavy injuries, like deep cuts on its flank and arms. Sadly, the poor brute wasn't able to get away in time, and got done in by a savage bite to the jugular." However, Riley reports the part the oddest part and the thing that keeps him up at night came afterword. As once the brown bear had ceased moving, the Black bear-like creature unhinged its jaw with a "large wet snap, slowly widening until it got to about the beast's shoulder blade."  Riley went on to report that the beast then proceeded to devour the head of the brown bear whole, violently jostling and tearing with its claws until it fully tore off the head. Riley reported that the brutality of the scene left him mortified. Stating that " I ran as quickly as I could without making a sound. I  felt that if even a leaf broke under my feet, that thing would hear and tear me to pieces." - end of article 

Attached to the article were three black and white photos Riley had taken. The first was pretty blurry as the two animals were thrashing about too much to get a clear view. The second was of the large black bear creature biting the neck of the brown bear. The final showed the black beast leering over the body of its victim, with the lower part of its mouth detached from the upper portion of its jaw. Leaving a large, empty black void in the photo. 

My body felt tense after reading this, as I was left in a stunned silence. Mr. Riley had been an acquaintance of my grampa, so I knew he wasn't the type to tell tall tales like this, but why did he never mention it? And why had I never heard of this? This reminded me of a conversation I overheard where Mr. Riley was talking about the incident with the bear he killed. A young local hunter and outdoorsman was praising him on his excellent marksmanship and ability to remain calm in such a harrowing encounter.

I remember him giving a scoff, saying, "Nothing praiseworthy about an unfortunate circumstance like that one, where nobody should have had to die. Besides... there are things out there much more deserving of a bullet." At the time, I didn't get it as I figured he might be referring to poachers, as Mr. Riley was a big lover of nature and only really kept a rifle with him for protection. But now... I think I have an idea about the weight behind those words and why Mr. Riley always brought a high-caliber rifle with him when hiking.

So far, this is all I have dug through of the files, but I will be sure to keep you guys posted as I go. Not sure if they will all be this crazy or interesting, but I can't know until I look right.
