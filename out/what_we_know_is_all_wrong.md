I have been contemplating about writing this for a long time. Truth is I don’t know if this is real or if it’s all in my head Whatever this is though has changed me in so many ways and I now know I am in danger. We all are.

But let’s start from the beginning.

The first time it happened I was praying. I had recently lost my Grandmother and I was feeling lost. I decided that I would turn to God to find peace and some answers and come to terms with her death. The chapel I went to was the one that my Grandmother used to take me. It was small and always very quiet. Not many people visited. I decided to go there to feel closer to her. As I walked in I could see no one in which made me feel better, I really didn’t want to lose it in front of other people. I sat down to enjoy the silence and started praying.

Imagine my surprise when in the middle of my prayer I heard this little voice whispering “I hear you”. I jumped up and looked around. I was clearly alone in and I could not locate the source of the voice. I decided that it was a figment of my imagination and continued to pray. 5 minutes later though the voice came stronger. “You shouldn’t be doing that” It was right next to my ear. So close it made the hairs on my neck stand up and sent shivers down my spine.

As I turned around I came face to face with a girl. She couldn’t have been older than me. Maybe 11-12. She was wearing this red dress and she was barefoot. Her hair was the darkest black I have ever seen and her eyes the same. I started screaming but at the same time I was mesmerised by her beauty. “Shhhhh” she said putting her hand on my mouth. “ do you want father to hear us?” Her touch was soothing and not threatening in any way. “Who are you?” I asked trying to fight back tears. “I am the Devil” she said. “ The first unwanted” I started trembling,fearing this was the end of me. She moved closer and as if reading my mind she said “Don’t worry my child, I won’t hurt you. I am not the one you should be afraid of. I have come to warn you as I have done with so many others”

A sudden noise, like whistling made her stop talking and I could see fear in her eyes. I tried to locate the source of the sound and by the time I turned around to face her she was gone.

Only her scent lingered. This lovely lavender scent.

I stayed there not moving, trying to listen for what felt like hours. I was sure I was going crazy and convinced myself this was all due to grief and lack of sleep but as I closed the door behind me to head to my car I heard her whisper again. “Be careful” ...

It had been a week since the incident and I had almost forgotten about it.

I could hear the occasional whisper and catch a glimpse of something red in the corner of my eye but never something specific.

Fate would have it I had to go and pick up my mom from the bus station and the only way there, yes you guessed it, was past the road with the chapel.

The drive was uneventful until I got to the crossing in front of the chapel. I was getting nervous remembering what had happened so I turned the radio on louder and tried to find a relaxing song.

And that’s when it came. The smell. The freakin’ lavender smell.

I looked up from the radio and there she was. She was standing in front of the car. She looked exactly as she had before but different at the same time. Older, tired.

I screamed and got out of the car. I started running in the field behind me. I was losing it! The tears came and I succumbed to my fate. I turn around to face her as I could feel she had followed me.

“What do you want from me” I screamed at her.

She looked at me with that deep sadness in her eyes and came closer.

“I want you to hear me out child. I want to protect you. I am running out of time and you have to help me”. I was lost for words but somehow mastered the courage to reply. “Me?! Help you? Aren’t you supposed to be all powerful and ummm evil?Aren’t you the Devil?”

She came next to me and this time smiled.

“My lovely child yes I was powerful once. But evil never. As for the name? I kind of hate it. You can call me Lilith.” Somewhere in the distance whistling was heard.

I tried to speak but she cut me off. “Child you have to understand that what you know is all wrong. The world is in danger. You have been taught so many lies. You have been deceived. I am not the one you should be afraid of. I am not the one that is going to hurt you. I was God once”. Hearing that I started laughing. I laughed and laughed because I was sure I was crazy. This could not be happening. This thing in front of me, Lilith, was claiming to be God.

She grabbed my hand and my laugh was cut short. “Child you have to understand” she said. “I don’t have much time. Can’t you see I am different? I am getting older. Dying even. He found a way to make it happen. And if I am gone there is no one to save you. See through the lies. Believe me”

The whistling was heard again. Closer. She squeezed my hand with profound urgency and pleading eyes.

Whatever made me say the next words changed my life forever. “Ok let’s say I start to believe you. How can I help. What is happening?”

The wind picked up suddenly and I saw her shivering. “Not here” she said “I will explain tonight. In the chapel. Tell no one where you are going. Don’t even think about it in your mind. He is everywhere”

And with that she disappeared. I was left alone once again thinking that I was insane. Imagining things. The red mark on my hand from where she held me though was there to prove me wrong.

I suddenly remembered about my mum and checked the time. I was surprised to see that no time had passed and somehow I was standing right next to my car.

I decided to do what I was told and not to dwell on it in my head. I don’t know who “he” was but I was suddenly afraid.

The rest of the drive was uneventful and I have to admit that seeing my mom made me feel better.

Upon returning home we sat down and had dinner together, happily chatting away and reminiscing about the last time she came to visit.

Suddenly she stood up and proceeded to say she had a gift for me. She ran out to the car and brought in this little packet and gave it to me.

“I hope you like it my dear. It’s a new perfume. Try it”, she said.

I thank her and proceeded to open it. I took the cap of to smell it and froze. It was lavender.

I tried my best to hide my horror from my mother and casually asked her why she chose to buy me this specific one.

In retrospective I wish I never asked because her answer chilled me to the core.

She explained that she was in the shop struggling to buy me a present when a girl approached her . A girl roughly my age. With a lovely red dress. Hey hair was the darkest black and so were her eyes. My mom said she was instantly drawn to the girl and they started chatting.

The girl was really interested to hear that my mother had a daughter and asked all sorts of questions about me. She said the girl suggested the perfume because it was her favourite. My mother said the girl seemed sure that I would love it as lavender has such a soothing and familiar scent.

I wish I could tell her how wrong she was.

With this discovery in my mind I decided I couldn’t hear any more so I found an excuse to cut the conversation short and put a film on.

A couple of hours later I said goodnight to my mom and headed up to my room.

The time was almost midnight. I made sure my mom went to bed, waited a bit until she fell asleep and got ready to make my way to the chapel.

I was terrified but determined to find out what was going on.

“Ok Lilith”, I whispered as I got in my car. “You have my attention”
