I hope that this post is able to shed some light on a situation that has been troubling my life for the past few months. My name is Grant. I am a lawyer in a small-town law firm out east, and in January I was contacted by a man who planned on suing a general practitioner for medical malpractice. This was not out of the ordinary as my law firm deals almost exclusively with medical cases and I find myself to be quite good at them. 



However, this particular client, whom I will remain unnamed for legal purposes, has caused me serious psychological stress, and I fear for my safety. During our first consultation over the phone, he informed me that he would be sending over his journal entries during the dates spanning his original accident, meeting with his care provider, and his eventual recovery. After reviewing the writings I responded to the client that I would not be taking on his case and that I thought it best he seek psychiatric and medical aid. Since declining to work with this client I have received several harassing emails, threatening letters, and most alarmingly, packages containing clumps of human meat crudely wrapped in packaging tape. 



I have gone to the police, however I am posting here to seek advice on how to proceed with the dilemma. I just want to feel safe again. Here are the journal entries. 



**Entry One**



In the process of selling my home, I knew I needed to fix it up a bit. It is by no means a dump, but there are some items of general upkeep that I have put off over the years, and no one wants to buy a house with a leaky faucet. One of the items on my to-do list was to knock off the wasp nests that had been building up and clean out my rain gutters. I have always been fairly handy, but a bit on the lazy side as well. 



When my father died he left me a large variety of tools that have been collecting rust in my garage. On a sunny Saturday, I took advantage of my day off from work and retrieved the ladder, gloves, and wasp spray from their resting places and ascended to the roof. There were several small nests that had gathered in the front, but the largest by far was set in the rear. After taking care of the little ones first I stirred up enough courage to tackle the behemoth in the back. 



It was even bigger than I had imagined it to be from the ground. Wasps swarmed and hummed as I drew near. For a moment I hesitated. I am not one to shy away from bugs, but no one likes to be stung. 



After taking a moment to prepare myself I pulled out the can of wasp spray and shot a stream of poisonous liquid at the hive. Immediately I realized that this nest was not like the others I had removed. Instead of killing the insects, my attack only seemed to anger them. I began to panic as several of the winged creatures flew straight past me and began circling back and around my body. 



One sting was all it took. Shock and fear took over my instincts and I shuffled forward rapidly. Only a moment later I found myself tumbling to the solid unforgiving earth below. This is the incident that brought about my current injuries. 



I sustained a fracture in my left arm, a cracked rib, and a concussion. While these injuries were not enjoyable to endure, they were nothing compared to the other problems I faced. I had landed on my side, with my shoulder taking the initial hit. Miraculously the x-rays revealed no broken bones on my right side, but a large black bruise wrapped around my shoulder, caller bone, and upper arm making it almost unusable. 



After a few hours in the hospital and a hefty bill attached, I was permitted to return home to recover. Like I said, the broken bones hurt, but there was something about my bruised right side that made even the smallest of tasks unbearable. I was prescribed a good amount of pain meds, but while they reduced the pain on my left side to virtually zero, the area of my body with the black bruise seemed wholly unaffected. It throbbed and ached like nothing I had experienced before. 



It is now Monday. I've contacted my boss and alerted him to my bodily state. I have received time off from work to recover. The black bruise has reduced in size, only covering my shoulder now, but the pain remains just as intense as the day I fell off the roof. 



**Entry Two**



It is now Tuesday. The bruise on my shoulder remains the biggest thorn in my side. I dont know how much more I can take of the pain. I went to the doctor this morning to complain about the pain medication I had received but was only told that some injuries can be stubborn, and to get some rest while I wait for the pain to slowly subside. 



But what the doctor didn't seem to understand is that the pain isn't subsiding. My other injuries have settled into a tolerable level of pain with the meds, but the shoulder bruise is all I think about. It is all that I could possibly think about. It demands to be felt every waking hour of the day. 



I can't fall asleep at night. I toss and turn, making sure to apply the least amount of pressure to my right side. It doesn't matter what position I'm in. The only thing on my mind is the dull ache of my right shoulder. 



Before I sat down to document today’s events, I stood in front of the mirror with my shirt off, staring at the bruise. The color isn't purple, green, yellow, or any other color that you might expect a bruise to be. It's black as coal. As I write this, a new development is occurring. 



Along with the dull ache, there seems to be a sort of phantom itch below the skin. Scratching doesn't help, though that isn't stopping me from trying. The itch seems to be in the muscle itself. A burning kind of itch that, along with the ache is threatening to drive me insane.



As I sit here scratching my shoulder, the throbbing is intensifying. Probably due to the disturbance of my hand rubbing furiously at the bruise, but the itch is beginning to outpace the pain. So I continue to scratch. I've taken off the sling my left arm was resting in. 



With the bodily sensations on my right side, I rarely even pause to notice the injuries on my left. I guess I should count that as a blessing. My bruise is so bad that my broken bones are hardly noticeable. Wouldn't any sane individual take a bad bruise over a fracture? 



Yet as I contemplate the trade-off, I would break any bone in my body to alleviate what I feel in my shoulder. That damn wasp nest, and those damn wasps. If it wasn't for them none of this would have happened. On top of it all, I am now behind schedule to get my house prepared for sale. 



Now that I think about it, I haven't even thought of selling my home since the accident. Before the fall, it was something that consumed my mind. They say moving is one of the most stressful events the average person may experience. Right up there with the death of a loved one or divorce. 



I dont know if I fully believe that. I know from experience that both death and divorce can be pretty rough. But I'll admit selling my house was getting awfully close to rivaling those dreadful events. I'm not rich, and the market hasn't been in the best place lately. Yet despite these worries that have plagued me, the bruise has taken priority. 



**Entry Three**



I would consider today a turning point in my recovery. It is now Thursday, of the same week as the last entry, and I've finally decided to take my healing into my own hands. The doctors couldn't help me, or at the very least they wouldn't help me. Those bastards. 



I wonder if I have grounds for a lawsuit here. After all, what kind of doctor sends away a patient in as much pain as I have been in? I'll have to contact a lawyer and get this settled later. For now, all that is on my mind is recovery. 



Since the medication wasn't helping, and the burning itch continued to worsen my already grim situation, I did a little at-home surgery. Nothing major. I'm not crazy. I just took a pair of tweezers and pulled away some of the dead skin on the surface of the bruise. 



It was somewhat satisfying to peel away the top layer of the blackened dermis, but I was shocked to find that no matter how much skin I pulled away, the layer below looked just as black. I'll admit that I ended up cutting away a larger chunk than I had originally planned to. But I think that I've made some real progress. I successfully pulled away enough skin to get close enough to the source of the itch for a gratifying scratch. 



Of course, this did not take away the itch completely, but now when it gets really bad I have a better avenue of digging my fingers in deep. I've scratched enough to leave my shoulder quite the bloody mess, but the relief I feel from scratching outweighs the additional damage my nails are causing the wound. I still haven't found a way to reduce the ache, but since today is the first time I've felt like I've made any kind of progress I am deciding to call it a win. I may even get some sleep tonight if I can get passed the incessant throb. 



I do think that I may have gotten a little carried away with the scratching. At one moment of serious desperation I feverishly scraped at my skin and without even realizing what I was doing, a finger slipped deeper into the wound than I had planned. With two knuckles submerged in my shoulder socket, I stared in horror at what I had done to myself. But right when pain and fear reached their peak I realized that with my finger inside the meaty portion of my shoulder, I could really scratch at the source. 



I pulled my finger out before I did too much damage, and a spurt of blood exited the wound. I've covered it up in a sort of psuedo-dressing. I dont want to bandage myself up too much. I still need access when the itching gets really bad, but I'm limiting myself now after going too deep. I will only scratch if I feel it is truly an emergency. 



**Entry Four**



I've found the solution to the shoulder pain. It is now Saturday. A full week has passed since my accident. I haven't left my house other than the time I went to that charlatan of a doctor. 



I am supposed to pick up a refill on my prescription soon but I won't need it since I haven't been taking the pills anyway. After the first time I picked away at my skin I have found myself going back to the bathroom mirror on multiple occasions to peel away just a little more. That was until I accidentally pulled away something thicker and tougher than the bruised skin. A small strip of muscle. 



At first, the pain was excruciating, but a moment later I realized that the dull ache had lessened some. At this news I literally shouted for joy, jumping up and down like a child who has just been told they are being taken to an amusement park. I went back into my garage to get some better equipment. The tweezers were fine for skin, but now I was in need of pliers. 



I've never been more grateful for my meager inheritance of my father's tools than I was when I pulled the rusty metal clamp from my toolkit. I no longer felt hesitant about the damage I was doing to my shoulder. The pain needed to stop. So I sat up on my bathroom vanity getting close to the mirror and began pulling at the meat with the pliers. 



Some pieces broke off in small chunks, but a really successful pull meant I was revealing a strip of muscle as long as three inches. Have you ever had an ingrown hair, and felt the satisfying relief of digging it out? It felt like that, although the pain was considerably more. With each rip and tear, I found myself feeling physically weaker, yet spiritually energized. 



The dull ache was finally gone. As I write this, I am completely free of pain. The gaping hole that was once my shoulder feels cool, liberated, and oddly euphoric. The whole area of my arm is tingling with delight. 



I honestly dont even remember what the pain felt like. The ecstasy is too powerful at this moment. I have the feeling that I am going to get a really good night's sleep. And I cannot wait to walk into that disgusting doctor's office that sent me packing with less than useless advice to “wait” and “rest”. 



I'm going to show them, all of them, the beauty and freedom I've found, in extraction. I was about to go to sleep when I noticed that my foot was feeling a bit tingly. I think I'll do one last surgery and call it a night.
