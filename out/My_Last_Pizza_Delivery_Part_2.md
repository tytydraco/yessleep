I advise you to read [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1osgbw4/my_last_pizza_delivery_part_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) first  
  
As I was led upstairs by the armed men, things didn’t look good at all.  
 There were bloodstains all the way up the stairs. I knew what was coming—  
 the only thing I didn’t know was *why* they were doing this to me.

We reached the top floor of the creaky wooden house. Then the man in all black ahead of me spoke.

“Take him to the waiting room, Jack. I’ll go help Brian pack up the organs.”

**NAH, DAWG.**  
 The moment I heard the word *organs*, I lost it.  
 I started sobbing and pleading, but the man with the revolver—Jack, now that I knew his name—drove his elbow into my back and told me to shut up.

He dragged me into a dark room with no lights, just one narrow window with no grills and made entirely out of glass.   
 Two other delivery guys were already there—different uniforms, different chains.  
 One was unconscious, tied to a chair.  
 The other sat against a pillar, mouth taped, eyes wide with panic.

Jack pulled up a chair, shoved me into it, and tied my hands to the backrest. He taped my mouth but still wasn’t satisfied. He wanted to tie my legs too, just to be safe, but couldn’t find another rope.

“WHERE ARE THE ROPES? I NEED MORE!”

“Check the basement, dumb-wit,” the grumpy old voice yelled back—the Brian guy I assumed it was, the same guy the tall man in black had mentioned earlier.

Jack glared at me before slowly walking away and closing the door.  
 He’d gone to the basement.  
 That meant I had *very little time* to act.

I inched myself—knees bent, chair scraping across the floor—toward the conscious guy.

“Did they do the same thing to you?” I whispered.

“Yeah. I don’t even know what they want. I keep hearing screams from the next room—and those maniacs laughing.”

An idea hit me.  
 I carefully loosened the ropes on his wrists, just enough so he could free himself later if needed.  
 If Jack came back and saw them completely untied, we’d both be dead.  
 The guy nodded in thanks while I painfully shuffled back, the chair’s weight dragging behind me.

I had barely settled when the door slammed open again.  
 Jack stormed in, holding a bundle of ropes.  
 His eyes darted from me to the other guy.

He noticed.

He **knew** I’d moved.

He came over and hit me—hard, right across the face.

“I TOLD YOU, BOY—NO FUNNY BUSINESS! WHAT DID YOU DO?”

I sobbed through the tape, shaking my head, but he wasn’t buying it.  
 He walked toward the other delivery guy.  
 My heart stopped.

But—thank God—Jack saw nothing unusual.  
 The ropes still looked tight enough.

Then the **chainsaw** roared to life in the next room, followed by a man’s terrified screams.

“STOP SCREAMING AND SMILE AT THE CAMERA!” the grumpy old voice—Brian—shouted.  
 The tall man in black burst out laughing.

These guys were psychos.

Now I understood everything.  
 They filmed people being tortured—probably sold the footage on the dark web—and then harvested their organs to sell.

Jack scrolled through his phone casually for the next thirty minutes, ignoring the constant screams echoing from the next room along with our sobs.  
 I was frozen, terrified, and so was the other conscious guy I’d helped earlier.  
 The third one… I didn’t even know if he was unconscious or dead.



After a while a voice shouted 

“JACK, BRING THE NEXT ONE”

“Which one should I bring next?” Jack yelled.

“BRING THE MUSCULAR GUY WHO JUST CAME IN. Keep the other two there for now.”

What??? THEY were referring to ME.

My stomach turned cold.  
 I had to do something—anything.  
 Were they actually going to torture me like that?

Jack walked over, untied my ropes, and freed me.  
 Then he pressed the revolver to my back and forced me out of the room, down the hallway. The time of the walk felt like an eternity. He then stopped in front of a door. Pushed me to the side before standing in front of the door.

He shoved the door open.

And what I saw next **terrified me.**
