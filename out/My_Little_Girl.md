Hi everyone, looking for some advice. I’m a first-time parent so I know that there are going to be things that I think are a big deal that turn out to be nothing, but has anyone had their child bite them like really hard? Earlier this week, I took my daughter, Calissa, to the park and on the way home I tripped and scrapped my palm. She’s only three and she’s in that stage where she wants to help. She even started trying to climb on the counters when I cook dinner it's adorable - anyways when I fell she asked “Is Mommy okay?” and I told her of course I was and it was just a little boo-boo like she gets sometimes. I showed her my hand and yes, it was bleeding a little but nothing major I’m not trying to traumatize my kid. She asked if she could kiss it better like I do for her and I said sure. It was a nice moment, I think she’s incredibly empathetic for her age. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, she gave me a quick kiss and then bit my hand. It wasn’t one of those little nibbles kids do sometimes either it was hard. She sunk her two front teeth into the heel of my palm and scrapped down the length of it until she hit about halfway up my arm and I had to shake her off because she wouldn’t stop. It really hurt. When I told her that it wasn’t okay and we don’t bite people she just looked at me like I was the bad guy. My kid is usually so sweet and caring but this was just bizarre. I’m a single mom so maybe this is her acting out because her other parent isn’t in the picture. Maybe I’m overthinking? 

&#x200B;

I don’t have a relationship with Calissa’s father, well I mean I assume father. The whole thing is a little hazy but a few years ago some girlfriends and I went camping and I must have had one too many at the fire and wandered into the woods. My friends said it was like I was a zombie and in some kind of trance. I was stuck out there for a few days before search and rescue found me. I don’t remember a lot. I try not to think about it if I’m being honest. When they found me and med-flighted me to the hospital the doctors told me I was four months pregnant according to my bloodwork. I tried to explain that I certainly wasn’t four months pregnant when I started the camping trip but they said stranger things have been known to happen and I must have been and just didn’t know it. I didn’t bother arguing that I was a virgin. 

&#x200B;

Ugh, sorry for the TMI LOL! But it's all fine now because I got my biggest little surprise ever, I can’t imagine what my life would be like if I didn’t have my little girl by my side. I know I’m rambling, I’m so tired lately it's like all I do is cook and feed Calissa, she must be going through some kind of growth spurt. Maybe that’s why she bit me? Maybe it has something to do with a vitamin deficiency? If any other moms or parents on here have an answer please let me know!

Hi everyone, I just wanted to thank you all for all the support and feedback on my last post. I did take Calissa to the doctors to get a panel done and they said all her levels looked normal so nothing hormonal or otherwise seems to be going on. I didn’t bother mentioning the biting incident at the office because I didn’t want them to think I was some crazy mom who can’t handle a little nibble from her kid. Her appetite is still crazy though! She’s eating more food than me daily but then still cries that she’s hungry. Maybe it's a gluten allergy? 

&#x200B;

While I’m writing here does anyone know of any daycare openings in the **REDACTED** area? Calissa was going to **REDACTED** School but I guess she had another biting accident over there and they have asked that we not come back. Not to sound like one of those internet Karen’s but doesn’t that seem a little silly? I mean yes she broke the skin but all kids go through a bitting phase. The problem (if you even want to call it that!) is I guess that she broke through the skin and the tendon and the bone and just straight through to the other side. But I read somewhere that a human finger is the same density as a carrot so it can’t be that hard to break through. She did do it twice though. They also couldn’t find the finger after the incident to reattach it. But when I pointed out that clearly the staff was not supervising the children I’m “shifting blame” and that the staff there “isn’t prepared to have one child bite off two fingers of another child”. 

&#x200B;

Frankly, I’m glad they asked us to leave I don’t want my child at a place where she isn’t supervised at all times. Trying to keep this post short as I promised my neighbor I would help put up flyers for her missing cat. I’m trying to do the neighborly thing but honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if that thing was dead and buried somewhere. It was constantly wandering in everyone’s yards and it would wreak havoc on garden beds. Between you and me I think it was the guy down the street LOL he HATES that cat! Thank you again for all the help hopefully the next post will be good news!

It’s me again. Does anyone have any tips and tricks on approaching the subject of death with a child as young as three? In my last post, I mentioned my neighbor’s cat that had gone missing. Well, they found parts of it scattered in the neighborhood. Someone said it must have died and then wild animals tore it apart GROSS! The thing is Calissa really liked that cat. She was always asking if we could let it inside or if we could have it for dinner LOL. I think she meant could we have the cat over for dinner - I love how her little brain works. 

&#x200B;

Anyways since the cat has turned up more or less I am wondering if I should explain it to her but we’ve never had pets or even a family member pass away so I’m not sure how to explain such a huge concept in a developmentally appropriate way.  Any help is appreciated and for those who may think I should just ignore it, she keeps asking about the cat so I feel like I have to say something!Still looking for daycares in the **REDACTED** area if anyone has any leads.

Me again. To all the comments saying to get an allergy test done - thank you! We found out she is allergic to dust mites but that doesn’t explain the eating habits I’ve been seeing. The doctors want to monitor her for further testing but I just don’t know if I’m comfortable with that. Don’t get me wrong I’m not anti-medicine I just worry that if I agree to these tests then she ends up getting more and more done and then before you know it she has spent some of her most formative years looking at the wall of a hospital room and I don’t want that for my kid! I don’t think any parent does. The biting is getting worse though. We co-sleep sometimes but I’ve had to put my foot down because once I’m asleep she starts biting again

&#x200B;

! Last night was the worst one yet. She came into my room around 3:00 am and asked if she could sleep with me and I told her yes but she couldn’t bite me. I told her if she needs something she needs to use her words. We fell asleep a little after that but I woke up to her attached to my breast. At first, I thought she was trying to breastfeed which was odd since she was a bottle baby but she wasn’t attached to my nipple but rather the upper portion of my breast closer to my collarbone. She sank her teeth in so deep the pain was unbearable. I thought I was going to pass out. I kept telling her to stop and that she was hurting me but it was like she unhinged her jaw and then bit down harder. I’ll admit that I’m not proud of what I did next but I felt like I had no choice! I grabbed her by the hair and just pulled her back. 

&#x200B;

I’m cringing just thinking about it, I’ve never even spanked her! As I pulled her away I watched the skin stretch and the break and I watched as she chewed and then swallowed the chunk of flesh. She smiled at me and I didn't even think about what she had just done I started thinking that she had lost her first tooth but it was because the room was so dark and the blood was so red it only looked like she was missing teeth. I took her to the bathroom and tries to make her swish with mouthwash to get some of the blood out of her mouth but she refused and ran off into her room. I tried to bandage myself up as much as I could but I was getting so dizzy I was worried I would hit my head if I fainted and I didn't want Calissa to see that. I had to call 911. When they got there they thought that Calissa was the one hurt because there was so much gore on her Little Mermaid nightgown. They had to pack the wound and transport me to the hospital to stop the bleeding. There is now a very large- almost too large- hole in my left breast. The doctor said it was incredibly deep and that it was close to hitting bone but I don’t think that's accurate. She is a three-year-old little girl with a bitting problem not some kind of monster. I swear doctors just try and scare you sometimes.

&#x200B;

 I’m sorry if this post seems scattered they have me on a lot of pain meds. I have to meet with a surgeon tomorrow to talk next steps since they are thinking plastic surgery is in the near future. I always wanted bigger boobs anyways LOL! If anyone on this site has any tips for how to stop the biting I would be so grateful! Has anyone ever gone through something like this? I’m starting to feel so alone in this. I know my kid can’t be the first one with a bitting problem but some days it feels like that. Being both parents is hard enough as it is. I’ve been able to handle it until now it seems. But maybe this is something I can't do alone. Anything is helpful.Hoping to hear from someone soon

It won’t stop but I won’t give up on my child. She’s my sweet little girl one minute and then she’s like some kind of maniac! I know that my sweet girl is still in there but it's like she is someone else. Last night we were watching Frozen and she loves Frozen but when I went to shut it off she said she wanted to watch it again and I said no, that it was bedtime. She lunged at my arm but I backed away before she could reach me. I tried the tip from BoyMUM899 (thank you for the kind message by the way) and I offered her an ice pop and told her I understood she was upset but that it was bedtime and we weren’t watching Frozen again and that I know she wants to bite her feelings out and that was okay but we need a safe option. Then she just went crazy. 

&#x200B;

She jumped off the couch and clawed at my face. I keep her nails short but somehow she just really got in there. She was slashing at my eyes so fast I couldn’t see and I pushed her off me but she bit down on my hand and tore off a flap of skin about the size of my cell phone. I was bleeding like crazy and I couldn’t see so I just kind of threw her to the ground. I feel awful about it, I’ve never in a million years even thought of hurting my child but it was like my self-preservation took over and I wasn’t her mommy and she wasn’t my baby. It was like being attacked by a rabid animal. I’m still on some pretty heavy-duty pain meds so maybe I just wasn’t in the right head space. Once I got her off me she bent backward and bumped her head on the wooden frame of the couch and that seemed to shake her out of it. She started to cry so I immediately went into mom mode and tried to comfort her. There was so much gore on her face though it looked like she was crying blood. I can’t get that image out of my mind. My little baby sitting there covered in blood- my blood- and then holding out her hands the same ones that almost clawed my eyes out to have me hold and console her. 

&#x200B;

The messed up part is that I did. I sat and rocked my baby on the living room floor even though my vision was clouded red with blood and the wounds on my hand soaked through her PJs. I guess that’s what being a mom really is about though. Making sure you’re child is okay even when you aren’t. I know it sounds dramatic but in that moment I felt really connected to my daughter in a way I hadn’t since the bitting began. I think we are on the road to healing.

Feeling empowered

I took the advice of some of the other parents in this forum (shout out to BabyGotBabies257!) and I am having Calissa spend the weekend with my mom. They don't have a super close bond - my mom is very skeptical of her conception AND SUPER RELIGIOUS - but they both seem excited to get to know each other a little better. Tonight is all about a mom vacation! I ordered some Thai food since I still can't use my right hand after the last incident but hey an excuse not to cook LOL. I bought a nice bottle of wine and I am going to relax with my feet up and this Mama is going to have some me-time!

&#x200B;

A message to all the trolls on this site please get a life! There is nothing wrong with my child! I also don't appreciate that we are throwing around words like demon, or possessed. Ever heard of having a "Threenager"? My baby is my miracle and I won't have faceless mobs on the internet try and tell me differently.Thank you to all the real parents who just get it.

If there is anyone out there who can read this please, please help me. My daughter, I don't know if I should even call her that - the child is back. She showed up at my door drenched in blood. I thought she was hurt. I thought there was an accident. She told me that Grandma tried to make her take a bath in special water. She called it Holdy Water. I think she meant Holy Water. Her eyes aren't the right color anymore. She's always had blue eyes but now they are black PITCH BLACK. 

&#x200B;

I think she killed my mother. I think my mother tried to exorcise whatever this thing is and she killed her. Screw mom guilt I knew something was wrong from the beginning! Since the day she was born, she's been wrong! I can't call the police. If she hears me call maybe she'll attack. Please someone help me. Please. Please. Oh God, she's knocking on the bathroom door. Her footsteps sound too heavy. SHE IS RIPPING THE DOOR OFF. PLEASE SOMEONE SEND HELP TO

The above information was pulled from several records on both a P.C. and cell phone of the deceased. Paramedics were alerted by several calls from surrounding areas that some sort of event was taking place at the redacted address listed in the above logs. Police arrived to find a three-year-old female child covered in blood and a young woman believed to be the mother of the child deceased in the bathroom of the home. 

&#x200B;

While certain reports can be verified such as the incident involving the other child and medical records have been obtained that match with the information given above no further evidence to support the recounting of events by the deceased exists. Further investigation will be needed.
