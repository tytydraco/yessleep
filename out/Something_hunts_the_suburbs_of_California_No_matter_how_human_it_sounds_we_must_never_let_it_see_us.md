As I sat in the living room with my family, I could hear the incessant and aggressive knocking on our doors and windows, the creature outside trying to lure us out into the night. The sound of its voice was twisted and inhuman, a grotesque mimicry of the human voice that only wanted to lure us out, take a glance at it.

My wife and children huddled close to me, fear etched on their faces as we waited it out, knowing that we had to survive until sunrise. I could see the fear in my wife's eyes, but I knew that I had to stay strong for my family. The creature outside was relentless, constantly trying to find a way into our home. It would slam against the windows, scratch at the doors, and let out an otherworldly scream that chilled me to the bone.  


Somewhere throughout the night I realized it could only get in if we let it in, which was why it constantly tried to lure us outside, and slammed the walls in frustration when we didn't. I had to protect my family, keep them safe from this creature that stalked our neighborhood in the dead of night, picking a house each nightfall to torment. So we waited, all of us holding our breath as we listened to the creature's every move.

As the night dragged on, the creature's tactics grew more desperate. It started to mimic the voices of our loved ones, calling out to us from outside. It was a sickening ploy, designed to trick us into opening the door and letting it in, and it impersonated the voices of fucking police officers who had come to 'check in' on the neighborhood. 

"Don't," I said. "It's the... thing."

"But I called the cops," my wife, Jolenne whispered.

"If it's them, they'll push their way through. It's the creature, I just know it. Look at the silhouette on the window. It's way too big to even be human."

I wasn't fooled. 

I knew that this was not the police or either my wife or children calling out to me, they were right fucking beside me, staring at the windows and doors in anticipation. When it mimicked the voice of a dead sibling, I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, adrenaline coursing through my veins as I stood my ground against the creature's wicked schemes. I could hear it moving around outside, scratching and clawing at the walls of our home, trying to find a way inside as the night dragged on without stop.-

Finally, as the first light of dawn began to peek over the horizon, the creature outside let out one final scream, as the sound of scuttling appendages and dragging, wet flesh echoed in our minds and ears. It was a sound of anger and frustration, as if it knew that it had been defeated, failed to catch its prey and next dinner. 

And then it was gone, fading away into the morning [light.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/zlb6u1/task_force_nova_compass_hunter_all_parts_so_far/)

We all let out a collective sigh of relief, our tense bodies finally relaxing as we realized that we had made it through the night. But when I opened the door, I saw the bloody, mutilated uniforms of two policemen, and a trail leading into the alleyways and farther [into the unknown.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/mjn4ot/the_complete_seaside_trilogytimeline_in_order/)
