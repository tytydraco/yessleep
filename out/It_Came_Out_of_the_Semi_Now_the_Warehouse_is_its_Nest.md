If you’re reading this, please send help. I’ll explain as much as I can, but I need to keep still. That’s how it finds you. It can feel when you move.

I’m at work. I’ve been stuck in the warehouse all night. I’m using the computer in the receiving office to type this. I think it went off looking for more people. But I can’t leave. If it feels me, it’ll catch me before I make it out.

It came out of the truck.

We opened the bay door like always, but there wasn’t any freight. It was at the very back, shrunken into a corner like it was trying to hide-all of its hairy, spindly limbs huddled together like a shield. We didn’t know what we were looking at. Mitch shone the lights on it, and I could see its black eyes gleam and reflect like awful, dark pearls.

It was so fast-so much faster than it should’ve been able to move. It crossed the entire trailer in under two seconds. It grabbed Mitch with its two front legs and pulled him in, slamming the door shut behind them. Mitch screamed. I could hear his voice move further down the trailer. He grunted-like the air had been forced out of him-and then it was quiet.

None of us moved after that. We just stared at the truck, like if we waited long enough, it might undo itself. Like Mitch might crawl out laughing. But the door didn’t open again.
Sam took the lock we use on the bay. But I think it’s intelligent. The semi’s door was cracked open-an almost imperceptible sliver. I noticed it too late. In that tiny crack, I saw the tip of one leg. It was waiting for us to come closer.

Before I could shout, it flung up the door and launched its massive body at Sam. Its legs closed around him like a birdcage. Its horrible fangs pierced his neck like knives. Sam couldn’t even scream. Red, yellow, and white bile foamed from his mouth. His eyes rolled back-and he was still.

The other four of us scattered.

George tried to use the ballymore to raise himself out of reach. He jumped onto the top of the aisles. Eric ran and hid behind a pallet. I ran into the office and slammed the door behind me. Trevor was closest to the fire escape.

Honestly, it fills me with terrible awe. I could see the thing thinking. Its gaze shifted from Trevor to the door and back. Before he could escape, it had crawled along the wall-right over the door. Trevor turned back too late. It dropped on him just like it had Sam. It pinned him on his stomach while it killed him-drinking out his blood.

The room was so quiet after that.
The warehouse is across from the main building, not attached. I could scream for help, but I’d be a dead man. I’ve been hiding under the desk in the office.

An awful series of tapping and dragging noises broke the silence. I heard it move to the ballymore George had used. I could see the top of it sway and shift-it was prodding it. Testing it. Then it climbed up, just as fast as it had crossed the trailer.

It carried Mitch, Sam, and Trevor up to the ceiling. They’re still there. Staring down at me with lifeless, corroded eyes-suspended in cocoons of white.

I don’t think it knows I’m here.
It stayed up there with them for a while, making its nest in the rafters. It looks like a blanket of silk, but I can see a small indentation when it’s there-waiting for someone to move.

But before it made its nest, it shot out its strings-seemingly at random. But I know they’re not. They’re like land mines. Touch one, and it knows exactly where you are.
The office doesn’t have a ceiling. It’s just two walls-a fake room in the corner of the warehouse. When it shot out those strings, some of them landed in the office. I’m trapped in here.

Like I said, I’ve been under the desk. I can peek out. I could even stand, if I wanted. But if I stand, it’ll see.

I feel the worst for George. He put himself between a rock and a hard place when he climbed to the top of the aisle. He was hiding under a tarp. It shielded him from its sight-but not from the strings. The tarp shifted just slightly when George adjusted. That tiny motion was enough.

That awful, sickening scuttling sound filled the warehouse again.

George didn’t go out like the others. He threw himself off the aisle. A quicker way to go, I guess.

His body-broken and gnarled from the fall-is staring down at me too. Emptied like a middle schooler’s juice box.

I don’t know if Eric is alive or not. I pray he made it out and is getting help.

The lights in the room are motion-activated. After ten minutes of stillness, they shut off. It’s been dark for hours now. I haven’t been able to use the computer-its light would give me away. Occasionally, I gather the courage to peek out from the desk. It spends most of its time completely still, hanging from the ceiling by its threads.

The entire warehouse has become its nest. It looks like a damn horror movie. Blood and poison drip out of my dead coworkers’ bodies and onto the concrete below.

I feel sick. We were just coworkers, but just a day ago I was joking with Sam and George about our asshole of a boss. And Mitch was talking my ear off about how pretty his new girlfriend was a week ago. Seeing them like this-it feels unreal.

Webs cover almost the entire room at this point.

About an hour ago, it nearly found me. I peeked when I shouldn’t have. I don’t know how it’s so quiet, or how the lights didn’t see it. It was perched on my window. I could see its segmented body right in front of my face. It creeped slowly further along the wall and out of sight.

I mentioned earlier-I think it’s gone for now. I wouldn’t be writing this if I didn’t think it was.
About twenty minutes ago, I heard something-maybe the back door opening. I don’t know. It was quiet. Very quiet. Then the lights flicked on, one by one, across the warehouse. That only happens when something moves.

It’s been hours since then, and the lights have stayed off.

I think it left.

I hope it’s gone.

I’m going to wait just a little longer. Then I’ll run. But my instincts are screaming at me. I know this thing is smart. This could be a trap to lure me.

Is it smart enough to pretend to leave? To mimic the noises I heard?

What if it’s still here, looking down at me from the darkness?

I can feel its gaze-its hunger.

But I can’t stay here forever.

The exit isn’t that far from the office-maybe twenty feet.

If I’m wrong, you won’t hear from me again. 

Please send help regardless, just in case Eric hasn’t been found.

If you have a job like mine, quit.

Don’t open the trucks.

Don’t unlock the bay.

Don’t move.
