I have known the truth for a few months now, and I have only refused to tell anybody because there is no hope. Besides, I have been far too terrified to consider cursing others with this knowledge. But there isn’t much for us to lose now, and perhaps this last-ditch confession may lead to a sliver of hope being restored.


An Eclipse is usually a momentous occasion, a time for the eyes of tens and hundreds of thousands to look up at our little corner of the Universe in wonder. Today will follow the same pattern of collective human joy. Until it doesn’t. From our perspective, the Moon will slowly begin to cross over the Sun and gradually block out the light it casts onto us until totality is reached and every ray of sunlight is suppressed. The Moon is then supposed to continue its journey across the face of the Sun until it allows an ever-increasing light to be once again cast upon us. 



Today, the darkness will conceal something far worse.


Three months ago, a radio transmission was received at our observatory. It was encoded, so took us a while to fully understand, but I wish we never did decode it. At least then I would have been able to have lived in blissful ignorance, like all of you have been able to. 




“*The replacement begins.*”



“*IV VIII MMXXIV*”.




We tried sending transmissions to the star system the message originated from, but received no reply. Over the next few weeks and months, we received a similar message once every 6 days. Slowly but surely, they began to reveal their plan to us. In an almost teasing manner. Knowing that nothing we can do could stop it and that the vast majority of us will have no idea it is happening. Under the cover of the Eclipse’s darkness and whilst large swathes of the populations in areas with totality are distracted by the sight before them, the species who had been sending us these toying messages will begin their gradual plan to replace us. To, on the face of things, become us. I suppose, perhaps luckily, the only reason I am able to describe the plan as gradual is that the distance between our star systems meant that they were only able to spare enough energy for a single large initial group. The rest of them won’t ever need to come here, because upon completion of the plan they will inhabit both their home planet and ours.



You see, in an ever-expanding and potentially infinite Universe, we cannot begin to imagine the possibilities that may exist. Nor the coincidences. Most people would call them Aliens, presumably with large spherical heads and small bodies, but we have come to refer to them as The Others. The reasoning for that is fairly simple, if hard for people uninvolved with the situation to believe. 




They say they look *exactly* like us. 




That they can replace us because nobody will ever be able to tell the difference between a human and one of them. That their technology and reasoning are far enough advanced that they are able to conceal the lack of similarities when it comes to elements outside of physical appearance. Maybe the only reason our Uncanny Valley instinct stuck around was to give us a tiny inkling that something isn’t right about them. They claim otherwise though, and I’d rather be safe than sorry.




Under the cover of darkness and distraction, they will strategically implant thousands of their species across our planet. Presumably through some form of ship in an unwatched corner of the sky. Despite our lack of recognition of them, they are able to recognise each other and so they will seek each other out through a period of months and years. Inevitably, they will mate. Grow their numbers, day by day and year by year. They say their gestation period is significantly faster than ours. Eventually, when they have increased their numbers by enough, they will begin to reveal themselves. We don’t know when this will be. Perhaps in a month, perhaps in a few years. Upon their grand revelation, they will violently subjugate our species and we will be used as labour if worthy and executed otherwise.




Our planet will be theirs. So will our species, our history and our lives.




Perhaps the select group of people who are aware of this sharing our knowledge may lead to some breakthrough. Something, anything to prevent our horrible, almost inevitable fate. The knowledge we have been burdened with has caused our lives to be filled with terror each waking moment. Perhaps it’s time for the burden to be shared, even if the same terror is bestowed upon yourselves.




So if you are in the path of the Eclipse today, please know that tomorrow you will wake up in a world with a small population of pretenders. I can only hope they do not succeed in their goal.
