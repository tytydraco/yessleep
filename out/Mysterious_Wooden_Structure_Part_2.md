A lot has happened since my last post. It’s hard to get my thoughts together right now, I’ll start from where I left off.

I knew that my next move would be to visit the structure during the day, so that’s exactly what I did just two days after I made the original post. I took my good camera with me so I could take pictures, that way it might be a little easier for people to determine what it is. I went the same way I had before, and took the path to the clearing.

It was gone.

It wasn’t destroyed or dismantled, it was not in pieces. It was simply gone. There was not a trace of the structure left. I looked all around the clearing for any remaining branches or logs, but the area was nearly spotless. The only thing in the clearing were the few trees that the wall was once woven around.

For a moment I actually considered that I might have imagined the whole thing, before I immediately remembered that Alex was there and we had the video.

“How?” I thought to myself. “How could it be completely removed so fast?”

I then thought that maybe someone had pushed it all away with a bulldozer or something, but that made no sense. No heavy machinery could make it into those woods with all those trees. And again, there was no trace.

Don’t get me wrong, I was thoroughly creeped out, but more than that I was overcome with an intense feeling of mystery and adventure. I needed to figure out what was happening in these woods.

I told Alex about what I found over a phone call. He almost didn’t believe me, he thought I was joking. When he realized I was serious, he paused for a moment.

“I don’t ever want to go back there,” he said bluntly.

“Look man, I know this is scary. But there has to be a logical explanation for this, right?” I started to doubt there was, but I was desperate to convince him. I couldn’t do it alone.

“I don’t want to go back.”

“Will you at least come by during the day? I’m here right now, there’s nothing scary going on. I’m alone.” There were a few moments of silence.

“This is the last time,” he sighed.

About twenty minutes later, he arrived. He followed me back into the woods and we examined where the structure had been.

“Yep, it’s definitely gone,” he said. “Now let’s leave and never come back.”

After we left that day, I couldn’t convince him to go back. When I first went into those woods, it wasn’t there. Now when I went back, it was gone. Both times were during the day. I had a strange feeling that if I went back during the night, it would be there again. My only problem was that I wasn’t brave enough to go out there at night by myself, and Alex was ready to forget he ever went.

The solution was recruiting my friend Mike. I told him everything about the structure, but I don’t think he really took it very seriously. That was fine by me, as long as I had some company.

Marie told me not to go back. She said it could be dangerous. I assured her that I would be careful and that it was probably just some neighborhood kids messing around or something. Again, I didn’t really believe that, but I was hyper focused on learning the truth.

The next night, Mike and I went to the forest. I made sure to bring my good camera this time. Mike brought a decent flashlight, that way we’d be able to see farther than a few feet.

“So you really think it’s gonna be here again?” he asked.

“I have no clue, but it’s worth checking out. If it’s not here now, then we know it was just a temporary thing.”

Oddly enough, I was really hoping it would be there. I hadn’t experienced something this exciting in a long time. Life is usually pretty boring.

After climbing over a few fallen trees and pushing past the thorny vines that reached out to embrace us, we came to the clearing.

“God damn,” I quietly chuckled to myself. In the middle of the clearing was the entire wooden wall, just as it was when I first saw it.

“Oh my god…” he gasped, “you weren’t kidding when you said it was huge. That’s gotta be at least ten feet tall!”

“I wasn’t lying!” I said through a grin.

I wasn’t as scared as I probably should’ve been. Instead, I had this feeling that I had discovered something great. This was truly unexplainable, and I was the one to discover it.

“Okay I know that it’s real now, but are you fucking with me? This thing didn’t really disappear before, did it?” Mike asked nervously.

“Come on, I gotta get some pictures of this thing!” I brushed off his questions.

I walked fast, almost jogging around it to the open end of the semi circular structure. Mike followed close behind me, his eyes were wide with disbelief. I took a few steps back and brought up the camera to photograph the whole thing.

“Hey Mike, can you stand in front of it for scale?” I said quickly.

“Uh, yeah sure, I guess.”

He walked slowly over to the mouth of the tall monument. I looked through the viewfinder and adjusted the zoom to capture the whole scene. I took a few more steps backward and stopped, but the crunching of leaves didn’t stop. After a moment, I realized it was coming from behind me.

Quickly, I jumped and whipped back to look behind me. All I could see were the trees a few feet in front of me; everything else was consumed by the night.

“W-What was that?” Mike trembled as he spoke.

“Quick, point the flashlight this way.”

The beam of light darted from where I was standing to the darkness beyond. Ahead of me, behind the bushes, appeared a figure. It was hard to tell, but it appeared to be a man with long dark hair. He seemed to be covered with some kind of animal pelt, like makeshift clothing, and he was dragging something heavy behind him.

“LEAVE NOW!” the man’s voice shot harshly through the air and stung my ears.

Before I could think, I was running after Mike. We both fled as fast as we could into the woods. With every bounding step, my camera bounced violently and tugged at my neck by the strap. Still, all I could focus on was getting as far away as fast as possible.

I heard the man shout something I couldn’t make out before his voice faded behind us.

Before long, we came across some very large boulders next to a tall cliff face. We quickly jumped behind one and turned to peek in the direction we came from. Many moments of silence followed, broken only by the sound of our gasping for air.

“Who… the fuck… was that?” Mike spoke between sharp breaths.

“I have… no fucking clue…” I replied.

We waited for a minute longer to catch our breath.

“That must be the one who keeps building the damn thing!” I whispered.

“Can we please leave now?”

“Yeah, just a minute. Let’s wait to make sure he lost us.”

I turned and looked to see where we were. The rocky landscape had massive boulders, most were larger than a bus, and they were heaped together creating caves.

“Where the hell are we?” I thought out loud. “I’ve never been this far back here, I didn’t think these woods were this big.”

Before I knew it, I was wandering deeper into the rocks. Mike followed behind, providing the light to see ahead of us. We walked up a stone incline toward the mouth of the cavern ahead of us and stopped to examine.

“I think we should turn around now,” I said as a chill crawled up my spine.

Just then, as if on cue, I saw something. It looked like a black spider the size of a hand crawling from under a boulder that leaned against the cliff face. It stopped at the edge and was at the same time followed by another, stopping just a few feet away. Between the creeping things now appeared what looked like a head, slowly peering out from beneath the rock. Two white eyes were all I could make out of the shadowy figure’s face. A deep, loud humming began to fill the air between us, shaking my bones at its loudest.

Almost instinctively, my hands had raised the camera up to my chest to snap a single photo without even thinking. The next thing I remember was chasing after Mike once again, this time screaming as I did. Between our pounding footsteps, I thought I heard what sounded like galloping from behind us, slowly growing closer.

We went straight back the way we came, ignoring the thought of the man in leather. We passed by the structure and he was nowhere to be seen. The galloping suddenly stopped. We didn’t stop running until we were at the car. Mike frantically yanked at the car door.

“UNLOCK THE FUCKING CAR!” he screamed as I mindlessly tugged at the other door. It felt like an hour passed as I fumbled the keys out of my pocket to get inside. The moment I pressed the button, we were inside the car and tearing down the street.

We didn’t talk the entire car ride. The roaring of the engine and our shaky breathing were the only sounds I heard the whole time. We only spoke when I dropped him off.

“I’m sorry…” I said. He didn’t respond as he left the car.

Here I am at home now trying to make sense of this. I didn’t get a picture of the structure, but I assure you it was there again. When I checked my camera, however, I felt ice run through my veins. The last picture showed the shadowy thing that stared at us from the cave.

Whatever sense of adventure I had before is gone. I’m sorry for those that are interested, but there’s no way I’m going back again, not after what I saw. A man in the woods that builds shelters is one thing, but what lives in that cave is something I can not understand.

Feel free to speculate about what this thing could be, and please let me know, but this is the only update I’m making.
