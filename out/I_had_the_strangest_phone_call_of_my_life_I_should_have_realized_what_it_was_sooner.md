I don’t know exactly where to start. I was in my dorm room and the sun was setting. My roommate, Alex, had gone cave exploring with his friends - he’d asked if I wanted to join, but I wasn’t a big fan of humidity and darkness.

I was just messing around on my laptop and convincing myself I’d start working on my translation homework soon. I’d run out of things to do when my phone rang - I thanked Alex for giving me another reason to procrastinate.

I answered a little too quickly. His voice exploded on the other side, interrupted by shaky breaths and the cracking of footsteps.

*Hey, dude.*

**Hi,** I replied. **You ok? You having fun?**

*Yeah. It’s cool. Hey, listen - can you come pick me up? In like an hour?*

**I thought you guys said you took the bus and then hiked to the entrance.**

*I’m really exhausted and I got lost and honestly I just want to get out. I want to get in your car and I don’t feel like hiking 3 miles back to the bus station.*

**Well, you should’ve thought about that before.**

*Dude, please.*

I thought about it for a minute. He’d sent me some location earlier - it was a 2-hour drive. **Look, I’m kinda low on gas. You’ll have to wait for me to fill up.** I responded, hoping he’d get the hint about gas money.

*Yeah, whatever. Just come. I’m cold and tired. I’ve been wandering around aimlessly for a while.*

**What do you mean? Are you alone? Where are the others?**

He took a deep breath before responding. *According to my map, I’m close to the other exit. The others - I don’t know. Dana said she was turning around a while ago and I haven’t heard from her since, and Luis and Astrid were right behind me for some time, but then I turned around and realized that, that Luis was gone, and we called for him, but, but he didn’t answer… and Astrid started acting strange, like she knew something I didn’t. She became hysterical and refused to go with me this way, and now I don’t know where the fuck she is. I’m honestly mad at them and I think they’re just pranking me. Please just pick me up.*

Something in his tone made me feel sorry for him. Maybe they *were* pranking him. His friend group had a weird habit of messing with each other. **Ok, I’ll come get you.**

*Thanks.*

**So, how is it?** I figured I could stay on the phone with him for a while, so he wouldn’t feel scared.

*Hey… hey Eli. You there?*

**Yeah.**

*Yeah, yeah… just… wow. This cave. You wouldn’t believe it. The entrance itself is huge. Yeah, it’s something else. The first passage is a little downward slope. Walls are wet, like glistening stone, and smooth, but kind of… weirdly soft in patches. I brushed my hand over one spot just to see… and it gave a tiny bit. Not mud or anything, just… elastic. Kinda warm.*

**Warm?**

*Yeah, I dunno. Probably just the humidity or something. Makes me wonder what kind of mineral deposits are in here.*

*The floor is soft too, in some places. Totally normal in a cave with this much moisture, right? You step and it depresses slightly, like packed dirt. Weirdly satisfying. I kept joking that it feels like a mattress.*

… A mattress?

*Don’t laugh, okay? It’s just… squishy in spots. You step, it sinks, then pops back. Very odd. But hey, makes walking fun. Keeps you on your toes.*

**Alright… just… be careful.**

*I know, I know. So we hit the first chamber. Huge. Ceiling vanishes into darkness. The walls glint, minerals catching the flashlight, shiny patches, streaks of red and brown. Looks like wet clay, but… not exactly. Almost organic-looking. But probably just light trickery. I mean… caves do weird stuff with reflection, right?*

**Yeah… sure.**

*There are these shadows, too. Weird angles, long thin things dangling from the ceiling. I keep telling myself they’re just roots or stalactites. But sometimes, they seem… to stretch a little when I blink. Like they’re following me. Totally my imagination, I’m sure.*

**Sounds… unsettling.**

*Nah, not really. More curious than anything. I even stepped on a soft patch that squelched a little… mud, I think. Or maybe water seeping under the rocks. Weird noises echoing, probably just the cave acoustics.*

*The air is thick, humid. Metallic smell in spots, probably just minerals. Either way, it’s intense. Makes you really feel the cave.*

*Anyway, the deeper I go, the passages twist and bend. I thought I’d be out by now. I turn thinking I’m going back to the first chamber, and… nope. Different place entirely. Angles change. Walls shift a little when I’m not looking. Totally normal for caves, right? I mean, natural erosion and all that.*

**Uh… yeah, sure.**

*There’s more. Shadows, veins in the floor, weird reflective puddles. Air pockets of warmth and cold in patches. Makes it exciting. Really makes you focus on every step. I’m loving it. Eli, you would love this.*

**Alex… you’re sounding… more nervous than you admit.**

*Nervous? Nah. Curious. Always curious. That’s all. I mean, it’s a cave. Of course it’s creepy in spots. But… really, I feel fine. I’m fine.*

The line crackled. I could hear faint gurgles echoing through the passages behind him, though he didn’t comment.

I hung up and I started my car. I’d been driving to the location of the cave for about one hour, when he called me again.

*Dude, this thing is fucking changing around me. I think there’s a stream of water below somewhere. I keep hearing this splashing below.*

**I’m almost there. Don’t worry. I’m almost there.**

*Okay.* Another shaky breath. *Okay.*

I parked my car and sighed at the sight of the hill I needed to climb to get to the location pin. He couldn’t have picked a more accessible entrance. It had to be somewhere you couldn’t reach by car.

After around 20 minutes of fighting with bushes and rocks, I finally got to the top. I stood on this clearing, puffing from the hike. The fog hung low, curling around the tree trunks. The hill stretched gently before me, dotted with dips and rises, shadows and light patches.

I called Alex.

**Hey, I’m… uh, here.** **Don’t panic. Just, I can’t find the entrance.**

*I can’t stay still! I keep moving, and everywhere I step, it reacts. The walls curve toward me. The floor lifts slightly. The air pulses… wet.*

**Alex… step back, just slowly.**

*I can’t step back… it’s… I think it’s following me. Or maybe… it’s holding me. The walls… the ceiling… the floor… all moving in time with each other, almost breathing together. I touched another wall… veins, ridges, folds. Warm, slick, alive. I think… I’m inside it.*

**Inside… what?**

I was beginning to lose my cool. The air around me was warm against my cold sweat. The sun was now fully down, and my eyes kept darting to the tree line, dark crowns of branches all around the clearing. The sky was enormous and hostile. I couldn’t find the entrance in the dark. I only had the moonlight and some faint stars guiding me. If I wasn’t going to find Alex…

*It’s not a cave, Eli. It’s… a body.*

**Stop saying that. Just fucking calm down and go back the way you came…**

*… a huge, grotesque organism*…

**… you’ll be fine, just stay fucking calm…**

*…* *everything I thought was rock is flesh. Veins, ridges, folds. Wet surfaces that pulse and breathe. I… I can feel it sensing me. Reacting to me. Every movement I make, it flexes beneath my hands and feet.*

**Alex…**

*Oh God, I can hear it. A heartbeat. Slow, wet, immense. It reverberates through the floor, through the walls, through the air.*

*I’m inside something alive.* *A living, breathing… monster.*

**Alex… you need to move back toward the entrance.**

*I think I’m inside its chest or head. Its… body. I can feel… it’s aware. And the sound… the sound of it breathing around me… wet, deep, alive… oh God…*

**Alex…**

The line fizzed with wet static. A low, gurgling pulse echoed faintly.

I started panicking. Alex was almost hysterical, yet his words were stressed, almost spit out. He kept rambling about guts and his friends.

*Oh my God, I think I found it. Holy shit.*

**The exit?**

I heard a bunch of obscenities, then a pause. When Alex finally spoke, I had stopped paying attention to him.

*I think I found its heart.*

I didn’t answer. In my continuous studying of my surroundings, I’d realized the tree line was now lower than when I’d gotten up there. I looked down, then back to the tree line, which was moving up and down almost imperceptibly. Then, it lowered.

And lowered.

And lowered.
