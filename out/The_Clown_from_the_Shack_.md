I’ve never done this before—posting in a place like this—but I need to. I need someone to believe me. Because if I don’t put this out there, maybe no one ever will, and God knows it’s already too late for some of us.

My name is Sarah Matthews. I’m the woman from Ridgeway you might have heard about on the news. You know, the one whose daughter went missing at the summer fair a year ago. They never found her body. Just blood—so much blood. The police think I’ve lost my mind. But I haven’t. I wish I had.

I’m writing this because there’s something happening here, and I need you to know what to avoid. If you ever see a brightly painted shack at a fair, if there’s a clown with a sign that says “Bingo,” walk away. No, run. And never, ever look back.

It started innocently enough. The fair was in full swing, the sky a perfect blue. I had Lily with me—God, she was so excited that day. Lily’s smile was the kind that could brighten any room. She had these golden curls and wide blue eyes that made people stop and compliment her. That day, I had promised her and her best friend, Emma, a full day of rides, junk food, and whatever else their little hearts desired.

It was Emma who first noticed the clown’s shack.

“Look!” she squealed, pointing to a small wooden structure painted in bright yellows and reds. There was a clown standing outside, his makeup exaggerated, his nose a giant red ball. A sign above him read Bingo the Clown – Magic Show in playful letters.

I didn’t like clowns. Something about their faces unsettled me, but I brushed it off. I wasn’t going to ruin their fun. Lily and Emma begged me to let them go inside.

“Just for a little while, Mom?” Lily tugged on my arm.

I sighed, smiling despite the growing knot in my stomach. “Alright. But I’m coming with you.”

Inside, the air was different. Heavy. The wooden walls seemed too close, the light too dim. Bingo had this smile—a smile that stretched wider than any smile should. His eyes were the worst. They were flat, black, like marbles. He performed tricks for the girls, simple things at first—balloon animals, a rabbit from his hat. But the whole time, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.

He looked at Lily the way a predator looks at prey.

I wanted to leave. I should’ve trusted my gut. But when I opened my mouth to suggest we go, Bingo locked eyes with me. He smiled, and the words died in my throat. The show continued, but everything was off. The tricks started getting stranger, darker.

Then, without warning, Bingo leaned down, his face inches from Lily’s. “Want to see a real magic trick, sweetheart?” His voice dripped with something dark, something wrong.

Before I could react, the lights in the shack flickered and went out. The room plunged into pitch blackness. I grabbed for Lily, for Emma—my hands only found empty space. My heart pounded, my breath catching in my throat.

“Lily?” I called out, panic creeping into my voice. “Emma?”

No answer.

And then… the screams. Short, sharp, and cut off as quickly as they began.

When the lights came back on, Emma was gone. Lily stood frozen, her face pale, her eyes wide with terror. Blood was smeared across the floor. The only sound was Bingo’s low, guttural laughter from the far corner of the room.

I ran to Lily, scooping her into my arms, but her body was stiff, as if she was in shock. Bingo watched us, his smile wider than before. His teeth—God, I can’t stop seeing his teeth—were sharp, jagged, like an animal’s.

“Where’s Emma?!” I screamed, my voice hoarse. But Bingo only laughed harder, pointing to the floor where something small and mangled lay. Emma’s shoe.

“Leave,” he whispered. “Or you’ll never leave at all.”

I didn’t think. I grabbed Lily and ran, bursting out of the shack, the cold night air hitting us hard. The fair was still going on, lights flashing, people laughing. No one had heard anything. No one knew what had just happened.

I ran until I couldn’t anymore. I ran straight to the police station, shaking, covered in blood. They never believed me. They found nothing in that shack—no bodies, no blood, no sign of Emma.

Lily hasn’t spoken a word since. She just stares into space, rocking back and forth. I’ve taken her to doctors, specialists, but they all say the same thing. Trauma. But I know better. It wasn’t trauma that did this to her. It was him. Bingo.

Here’s the part that I haven’t told anyone. The part that keeps me awake at night.

Three weeks after the fair, I found something on my bed. Something that wasn’t there before. It was a single balloon animal—a dog, twisted in that same, familiar way. Sitting next to it was a note, written in red ink, smeared and dripping.

“She’s next.”

I don’t know how I survived that night, or why he let me go. But I know he’s not done with us. I know he’s waiting. So, I’m writing this now, hoping someone out there will listen before it’s too late.

Because I can feel him watching. Every night, just outside my window, I hear the faint squeak of rubber shoes.

And I know he’s coming back.

For her.

For Lily.

For me.
