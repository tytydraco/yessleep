Hey, it’s me again, Hiroshi Nakamura. I’m not sure why I’m even writing this anymore. Maybe it’s a way to keep myself sane. It’s been over a month since my last post. Back then, I thought things couldn’t get worse, but I was wrong. I’ve seen too much, and the person I was before all this is gone. Writing these words feels like throwing a message into the ocean, hoping someone will find it before the tide takes it away.

The power and internet came back a few days ago. At first, I felt relief, a glimmer of normalcy in this nightmare. But it’s not normal. The connection flickers, unstable, and every time I open a website, I’m met with the same message: “The situation is under control. Remain calm. Stay indoors and await further instructions.” It’s a lie. I know it’s a lie because I’ve seen what’s outside. The streets are empty, the buildings abandoned, and at night, the air is filled with distant screams and gunfire. Whatever control they claim to have, it’s slipping away.

A month ago, when the power first went out, chaos spread like wildfire. People panicked. Stores were looted, neighbors turned on each other, and the streets became battlegrounds. I stayed inside, locking the doors, sealing the windows. My wife… she was still here then. She was still herself, or at least I thought she was. But she kept changing. She stopped talking, stopped eating. All she did was stare out the window, her eyes glassy, her lips moving like she was whispering to someone I couldn’t see.

Two weeks ago, soldiers came to the apartment. I’d heard them before, their heavy boots echoing in the hallways, but this time they stopped at my door. They shouted for me to open up, and before I could respond, they forced their way in. My wife was sitting in her usual spot, unmoving, her skin pale, her eyes red-rimmed and unfocused. I tried to explain, to beg them to leave us alone, but they weren’t listening. They saw her, and one of them raised his gun immediately.

The soldier closest to her hesitated, glancing back at a man in a hazmat suit who seemed to be in charge. The man nodded, and the soldier stepped closer, reaching out like he was trying to assess her. That’s when she moved. Faster than I thought possible, she lunged at him, her nails tearing through his suit. And her mouth… God, her mouth. Black, writhing things spilled out, thin and serpentine, reaching for the soldier’s face. He screamed, stumbling back as one of the others fired.

The shot hit her in the chest, and she collapsed to the floor. The room was silent except for the ragged breathing of the soldiers. The man in the hazmat suit barked orders, and they dragged her body out without another word. They didn’t ask about me, didn’t check if I was infected. They just left, leaving the door wide open. I closed it and locked it, but it felt pointless. They’d already taken her. The woman I loved, the person she used to be, was gone.

Since then, I’ve been alone. The days blur together, the nights are unbearable. I ration what little food I have left, eating expired cans and stale crackers. I don’t trust the bottled water I found in the store. Instead, I collect rainwater when I can, boiling it on a small camping stove. It’s not much, but it keeps me alive.

The internet is a strange lifeline. I’ve found forums filled with people like me, sharing their stories. A man from Osaka wrote about his brother, who drank tap water and walked straight into the ocean. A woman from Sendai described black tendrils emerging from storm drains after heavy rain. The posts are fragmented, desperate, and no one seems to have answers. The official news channels haven’t updated in weeks. The government’s silence is louder than any of the chaos outside.

That comment from "thatbeatifulsound" still echoes in my mind. He said it might be too late for my wife, and he was right. He might be right about everything. The water isn’t just contaminated. It’s doing something, changing people, but I don’t understand how. I’ve seen it. Those black, writhing things that spilled from her mouth. They moved like they had a purpose, like they were searching for something. Parasite, disease, curse… I don’t know what it is. All I know is that it’s spreading, and no one knows how to stop it.

Last night, I heard something outside my door. Not footsteps, but a wet, dragging sound. Like something heavy being pulled across the floor. I looked through the peephole but saw nothing. The sound didn’t stop. It moved back and forth, circling my apartment for hours. I didn’t sleep.

I keep wondering if I’ve already been exposed. What if it’s inside me, waiting? Is that why the soldiers didn’t ask questions, why they didn’t take me with her? Maybe they already knew. Maybe they’re just letting it run its course.

Tonight, the lights flickered again. The internet cut out for a moment, then came back. I’m writing this while I still can. If this is my last entry, then let it be a warning. Stay away from the water. Don’t trust it. Don’t trust anyone who’s been near it.

And if it’s already too late for you, I’m sorry. I don’t think any of us will make it out of this.
