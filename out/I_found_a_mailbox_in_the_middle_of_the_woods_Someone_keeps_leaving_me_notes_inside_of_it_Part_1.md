I found the mailbox about three weeks ago. It was haphazardly nailed into the trunk of a particularly old looking tree. The mailbox itself seemed old as well. It was rusty, and covered in black paint that was starting to chip near the edges.

Thin tendrils of ivy had snaked their way around the exterior of the mailbox, giving it the perfect camouflage against the dark green background of the surrounding woods. It’s amazing that I even managed to see it in the first place.

I stumbled upon it completely by accident during my usual after work hike. I had decided to explore a route that I had never taken before because walking through a new part of the woods was always a nice change of scenery. After about 15 minutes of walking though, I realized that I didn’t know how long this particular path was. I wasn’t too concerned about it though because every hiking trail in this park eventually looped back around at some point. So, all I had to do was keep walking.

Well, you can imagine my surprise then, when I finally reached the end of the path only to find absolutely nothing there. The trail just sort of dead ended into a line of trees.

It was at that spot in the woods where I first I noticed the mailbox. There it was, so out of place in the middle of nowhere that I couldn’t help but ask myself what the hell it was doing out there to begin with.

I stared at it for a few seconds before I noticed that the faded red flag on the side of the box was facing up, indicating that there was outgoing mail inside. So, naturally I approached the mailbox and opened the front door before reaching my hand inside.

I don’t know if I was actually expecting something to be in there, but I was surprised all the same when I felt my fingers brush against the unmistakable feeling of paper.

I pulled the item out, figuring that it was probably just a map of the hiking trails or something, left there by a park ranger. But once I took it out fully, I realized that it was just a normal, white envelope. And despite the old, rusty look of the mailbox, this particular envelope appeared to be brand new. Like someone had placed it inside the box earlier that morning.

I had to open it right? I know that opening someone else’s mail is considered a felony, but whose mail could it possibly be? I was in the middle of a wooded park. There wasn’t a building within five miles of where I was standing.

So I opened it.

I pulled out the piece of paper inside, expecting a treasure map or some long forgotten ancient scroll, but it was just a simple, handwritten letter. I was disappointed to say the least, until I started reading.

**To whom it may concern,**

**There is a car parked in the lot next to the abandoned gas station on Shady Lane. The trunk of the car should be unlocked. Inside the trunk is a briefcase. Take the briefcase to the white building on Sycamore Street and leave it near the front entrance. Knock three times, and don’t be there when they open the door.**

**More instructions will follow.**

So, if you’re like me the first thing you'd probably think of after reading something like that is “fuck, I just found someone’s secret drug deal.”

But after mulling it over for a few minutes, I realized how little sense that actually made. I mean, if this was actually a drug deal, then this had to be the most inefficient way to go about doing it. Why place the mailbox where it is?

Sure, it’s a secluded spot out in the middle of nowhere, but it’s also a thirty minute walk just to get there. That’s a round trip of one hour. Why in the hell would you set up your drug deal in a way that required you to walk a minimum of one hour every time you wanted to communicate something. And why put it in the middle of a park, where any asshole could just stumble across it and know your entire plan. It just didn’t make sense.

“But someone definitely left the note,” I thought. “And that someone left it with very explicit instructions that they wanted someone else to follow. Would they know that I saw it then?  I mean, how could they not know, I ripped the damn thing open."

Suddenly not feeling so safe anymore, I decided to just leave the note where it was, so that it couldn’t be traced back to me in any way. Hopefully, the actual recipient of the letter will just overlook the fact that it’s already been opened by someone else. I quickly turned around and doubled back down the path, making sure to keep an eye out for anybody else making their way down that specific trail.

Several days passed without me returning to the park. I didn’t even feel comfortable enough to walk my normal route. I was too scared to be out there alone, but eventually my curiosity got the better of me.

As stupid as it sounds, one week after finding the mailbox, I decided to travel back down the hidden path so that I could take a look at the sight one more time. Just to prove to myself that it was actually there, and that I didn't make it all up. I needed to see it with my own eyes.

After a 30 minute walk, I was back at the dead end of the trail.

In front of me was the tree with the black mailbox, and as I approached it I noticed that the flag was still up and the front door was still open. Inside the box I found the envelope. It was still torn open and the letter was still inside, exactly how I had left it. I honestly didn’t know if that made me feel better or worse.

I read the letter again, this time paying closer attention to the last line.

**More instructions will follow.**

That meant that there were more pieces to this puzzle. More pieces that I haven't uncovered yet because I never completed the first task. Maybe this was just some weird ARG that I accidentally stumbled across. That seemed plausible, at least, right? And in order to get to the next step of the puzzle, I had to do what the letter was telling me to do.

I guess the week-long absence had left me feeling bolder, because that was all the convincing that I needed. I took the note and turned around to head back home, but before I left I reached out and pushed the flag of the mailbox down, so that it was flush against the side. Almost as if to say, “fine I’ll do it.” I’m not sure if that was a necessary step, but part of me believed that it was.

I did exactly as the note instructed me to do. I found the abandoned gas station that it had mentioned with little difficulty. And in the lot next to the vacant building was a car, exactly where the letter said it would be. The trunk was unlocked like it had promised and inside was the briefcase.

It was then that I realized just how insane this whole situation was making me feel. It defied all logic, but there I was. Following the instructions from a piece of paper that I found in a mailbox in the middle of the woods. How could it get crazier than that?

I took the briefcase with me, and as I made my way over to the drop off point I began to notice that a quiet hum was starting to fill the air. I pulled the briefcase closer to my ear and realized that the hum was coming from the case itself. Or, rather, something inside the case.

Luckily for me though, the briefcase had a mechanical lock on the outside. So, I couldn’t open it even if I wanted to.

As I continued walking, I could feel the entire case beginning to vibrate with some sort of mechanical buzz, and by the time I made it to the white building on Sycamore Street my whole arm was starting to tingle.

I dropped the case near the front entrance, knocked three times, and almost sprinted away from the building before anybody could open the door.

The whole thing was quite exhilarating actually. The shot of adrenaline that I felt when I first found the car next to that abandoned gas station was one of the most exciting things that I had ever experienced. I mean, how could you not get addicted to something like this?

The following day, I found myself back in the park taking the secret path all the way down to where the black mailbox was stashed away. Before I even made it to the end of the trail, part of me already knew that the flag was going to be up and a new note was going to be inside. And sure enough when I arrived at the dead end, that’s exactly what I found.

I greedily read the new letter, expecting another package delivery or something along those lines, but instead of that, the instructions referenced a completely different assignment.

**To whom it may concern,**

**There is a homeless man that panhandles outside the general store on the corner of Pine Avenue everyday from noon to five. Put exactly $1.78 into his cup and tell him that it’s from his good friend Brenden.**

**More instructions will follow.**

I definitely wasn’t expecting that. I’m actually very familiar with Pine Avenue and the homeless man that sits outside the general store there. I take that road everyday on my way home from work.

That man has been sitting in that very same spot for years now. I even remember given him some spare change once before as I was exiting the store.

If this was just some drawn out ARG like I thought that it was, then there is know way in hell that the homeless guy could be in on it. I mean, how could he be?

Also, how did the person leaving me the notes know that I had completed the last one? They must have known, right?

The first time I found the envelope I had left it there for a week after ripping it open and absolutely nothing happened. However, the day after I finally completed what the note told me to do, a new one appears?

Was it just a coincidence? Or am I being watched? Who put the mailbox out there in the first place? And why?

I asked myself all of these questions as I made my way over to Pine Avenue. And sure enough, there was the homeless man sitting outside the general store like he had been for the last two years that I’ve seen him.

I grabbed $1.78 in loose change from my center console and counted it twice before hoping out and walking over to where he was seated.

I placed the money into his cup before leaning down and saying, “from your good friend Brenden.”

The man's head shot up immediately. He looked terrified.

I leaned back in surprise and was about to apologize for startling him, when he spoke.

“How did you…who told you about…" he began but never finished. "Are...are you real?”

He looked like he was on the verge of tears. His hand was shaking so badly that he dropped his cup of money. I was too stunned to speak.

Without another word the poor man got up from his spot on the street and took off running down Pine Avenue. I followed him all the way until he disappeared behind some buildings.

I felt awful, but I had no idea that he was going to react like that. I'm also saddened to say it, but ever since that day, I've never seen that man again.

Now, I just want to say up front that I know you guys are going to think less of me for going back to the mailbox after such a traumatizing incident. And you might not believe me when I tell you this, but I couldn’t help myself.

I just had to know what the next note said. It was too damn fascinating to pass up. How did the person leaving these notes know about this stuff? Part of me thought that if I just kept reading the letters, and followed their instructions, that I would eventually learn why that mailbox was out there in the first place.

And it was this morbid curiosity that ultimately led me into the situation that I now find myself in.

Over the next couple of weeks, I got into the normal routine of visiting the black mailbox everyday after work. The flag would be up, so I’d pull out the envelope and open it up. Inside would be a handwritten letter giving me specific instructions about some weird task that I needed to complete. I’d lower the flag and would retrace my steps back up the path.

The assignments were never violent, or illegal in any way. And most of the time I’d have it completed within an hour or two. I'd come back the following day, and provided that I had accomplished the previous day's task, a new envelope would be waiting for me.

Each letter would begin with “To whom it may concern,” and they always ended with “More instructions will follow.” Along with those two things though, the actual body of the letter would vary in what it was asking me to do. But no matter what it said, the instructions were always super specific and extremely weird:

**Go to the local community college and throw a coin into the fountain in the middle of campus at exactly 7:04 p.m. Make sure the coin is from 1997 or earlier.**

**Rent the movie “Bedtime for Bonzo” and pause it at exactly 43 minutes 15 seconds. Wait for 10 minutes and then continue watching the film.**

**Go to the Mr. Clean automatic car wash on Oak Street and get the premium wash. While the car is being cleaned, have a song from the 80s playing over the radio.**

Those are strange enough on their own, but the letters that require me to interact with other people are even more worrisome. These interactions varied, from a simple conversation to actual physical contact. No matter what the situation was though, these tasks almost always ended poorly.

However, the most alarming assignment that I’ve had to deal with so far involved a pick up and delivery, similar to the first note that I ever completed. This “package” as the letter so lovingly put was located next to a dumpster behind the movie theater. So I arrived there expecting to find a briefcase or a cardboard box, but no! It turned out to be a baby.

A fucking baby!

He was just chilling there next to the dumpster in one of those carriers that parents use as a car seat. I picked him up off the ground completely stunned and took him to the address that was given to me in the note. Upon arrival to the drop off area, I knocked on the door and a woman in her mid thirties greeted me with an unenthusiastic hello.

I held up the baby, and said “Zach will come by on Tuesday for pick up,” as per the letter’s instructions.

Without so much as a thank you, the woman snatched the carrier from my hands and pulled the baby inside before slamming the door in my face. I knocked several more times after that, but she never answered.

That was definitely the worst of them so far, but it’s not why I’m writing this. No, I’m writing this because of something that happened to me yesterday.

I made my way down to the black mailbox as I usually do, and everything seemed normal. The flag was up like it typically is, and inside that box was a piece of mail. It wasn’t until I pulled the envelope out that my breath hitched a little.

The envelope I was holding was fire engine red.

“That‘s new,” I thought to myself. “Is red a good thing?”

Of course it’s not, but I opened it anyway. I pulled out the letter inside and read the first line before immediately shoving it back in. Now, it may seem obvious with the benefit of hindsight, but it wasn’t until this very moment that I felt like I was in legitimate danger.

A shot of cold terror ripped its way down my spine.

How could they know? How could they know? How could they know?

But of course they knew. They knew the entire time, just like they knew everything else.

But why now?

That was the million dollar question.

I pulled the top of the letter back out of the envelope and read the first line out loud:

**Dear Vincent…**
