We beat the fuck out of him. We stomped him kicked him. I'm not going to lie. Having someone's life in your hands is such a high. It's adrenaline mixed with fear. But it's definitely a high. He sat there tied to a chair crying, bleeding, Begging. In a situation like that we were all feeding off each other's energy. We didn't really want to be there torturing him. But we were all too scared to speak up. We didn't want to end up tied to a chair next. At first his pleas and Begging was making me think of my family. My mother, what would she think of me if she saw me at my worst. Or how would they feel knowing I had been tortured in this way. We were like wolves. God abandoned us. This was hell.

We got the orders at 4 a.m.  We we were to take him back and have him point out the other's helping him. We threw him in the trunk of the car Wicho drove and Yeko rode with him.  Me and Rasgo followed behind on the dusty dirt road back to the main ranch.

When we got there they had 6 other's hog tied and blind folded. Some were bleeding other's were gagged. They were lined up side by side hands tied behind their backs. When they took the blind folds off of them they started Begging so they were beat back into silence. One of them got their nose broken and he fell so hard hitting his head on a loose brick he started having convulsions, so he was kicked and had his head stomped so hard his eye ball popped out. The blood mixed with the dirt and made bloody mud covering his face. He started twitching like how chickens do when you cut their head off.  Kicking and twitching violently he broke the zip ties and his arms were moving in such a way that he seemed possessed. His shrieking made the other captives start pleading and Begging for their lives.

I guess they realize now, they won't live much longer. Instead of killing him with a bullet and ending there. One of the armed men picked up the brick and started beating his face in until there was nothing left but pieces of his brain, bone fragments, teeth, hair all clumped in a bloody mud paste where his head used to be. That's a fear tactic done in front of the other captives. Now they are less likely to lie.  Its out of fear and to hopefully gain some type of favor to get killed fast and not painfully.

We got their friend out of the trunk and threw him in front of the captives.  He was unrecognizable, but when we flipped him over to show his shoulder tattoo they knew it was him.  They knew they were fucked. They were working with the rival cartel and the chief of police. They were picking up people and demanding a ransom. They were killing civilians. Their sole purpose was to raise hell in our town In hopes of bringing the Mexican military to stop the violence. They were stealing cars, decapitated the mayors brother in law and sister.

If the Mexican military cane here to stop the violence it would be bad for business, surely it would weaken the cartel and made it easier for them to cone in and take over while we are weakened by the Mexican military. Luckily we caught it in time.

They were interrogated, they gave names of the leaders of the different cells. Their locations and their code names. Once we got everything they had to give they were shot in the head and taken to "El Puerco" the hog. Higher ranking corpses can't be just buried in a mass grave. They are taken to el Puerco and all that's left after he gets done is teeth and small bone shards. EL puerco is a fat disgusting short tempered slob. His clothes is always bloodstained and he smells like diesel gas. I've never seen him clean I doubt he even showers. They call him El puerco because he stays at the pig ranch and he turns bodies into slop. The smell from the pigs and their shit and filth cover up the burning smell so it's all part of the perfectly orchestrated hell that I'm a part of. God abandoned us.
