I  Just texted my drug dealer a few minutes ago, haven't hit him up in almost a year. His name is Yuri, odd name, I know. He's from Russia. Moved here when he was a kid.... Still has the accent, though. I call him Chekov, he hates that. He's a nice guy if you can get past the whole "Sells drugs part". I've been sober for the past year, now I'm sitting on pins and needles, waiting for him to respond. 

Maybe he's busy... Maybe he's ignoring me... I did sort of drop off the map, I'd be pissed if one of my friends did that to me. Can you even be friends with your drug dealer? I guess it doesn't matter. In the end, it all boils down to simple math. I provide the cash, he provides the product... Capitalism at its finest. Heroin was always my coffin nail of choice. I may have told him that I needed a lot. I may have used an excessive number of exclamation points. Money isn't an object now, due in part to narcotic craving tunnel vision.

All that matters is the end result... All that matters is that I jam enough poison into my arm, to ease me into that warm goodnight.

If you're currently wondering what would cause such a tragically stereotypical relapse, you'd have to look no further than my father, the congressman. Politics, you see was always more important to dear old Dad than, oh, I don't know his family. My Father spent decades crafting a meticulously false public image that he could sell to the God-fearing conservatives that make up this wonderful nation of ours.

Dad was a Republican patriot by day, and an alcoholic, wife beater by night. He laid into my Mother like It was a second profession. Everywhere went for the liquor cabinet, I knew that violence would soon follow.  She never left him, I guess that was an impossibility. All she could do was take his drunken attacks, and do her best to put the pieces back together once he finally got tired of hurting her.   

One night I remember in vivid detail, coming down. The stairs to find him on top of my Mother. She kept struggling as he tried to clumsily rip her clothes off. When he finally saw me standing there he told me that he and my Mother were just having an Adult conversation. 

He told me to go back upstairs. I didn't go back upstairs, something about that look in my Mother's eye, the sheer helplessness, it caused something to snap inside of me. I ran at my father and attacked him to the best of a nine-year-old girl's ability. He threw me into the bookcase. I guess that sobered him up because he stopped soon after. I think that was the night when my Mother and I finally had enough. I would voice my anger through a subsequent life of juvenile delinquency....

Mom, she showed her resentment in a less subtle way... She killed herself using my Father's a 44 Magnum. The Congressman, being both a fan of Clint Eastwood movies and the second amendment, found himself suddenly between a rock and a hard place. The religious implications of suicide, the political implications if he said it was an accident. I cared about neither. I was just angry that she acted out of her own self-interest, leaving me to live alone with my Father in the process. 

My teens were about as militant as you think. I renounced God, picked up a smoking habit, and made it public knowledge that my premarital escapades had yielded unexpected results... I found out I was gay. This revelation was met with the expected backlash... It wasn't until my Father walked in on me and a classmate upstairs 69ing each other instead of studying, that he finally decided to bring down "The wrath of God". That was accomplished when he sent me to St Alda's girl school.

I don't know how he came across the place. The school was hidden in the rural abyss of upstate New York. St Alda's had all the common trademarks of a Catholic boarding school, nonrevealing uniforms, cultish  rituals, and food that tasted like it was made in a concentration camp. Even with such obvious tropes, there was something that eerily stood out  beyond everything else, All the girls there were in a constant state of fear, something I never understood. 

The Gestapo-like nuns that patrolled the schools, strict as they may have been, offered very little in the form of intimidation.  I was determined to continue my unbroken streak of rebellion. I stole, I cursed, I defaced... Any and all forms of discipline were just met with further troublemaking The other students avoided me like the plague, I relished in it...

The only person I connected with was a girl named Ruth. We shared a room. While our interactions were scarce in those first few months, we eventually bonded over a shared love for the band Greenday, all in confidence of course. Our shared comradery eventually took a turn for the intimate one night, when we found ourselves making out under the covers. Ruth stopped me before things could go any further. I sat up and watched as her demeanor take a sudden shift from highly aroused to frantically distraught. 

Tears streamed down the sides of her face as she nervously began to ramble on about the sin that we had just committed seconds earlier. When I tried to assure her that everything was going to be OK, she responded by shaking her head back and forth so hard, I thought her head was going to suddenly pop off. 

She starting ranting about how the sisters would eventually find out... How the sisters always find out. She told me that they were going to take us down to the secret room a place where bad things happened, the room that sinners were taken to. I had never heard of such a place, it was the opposite for the girls of St Alda's... For them, the room represented unseen horrors for those who deviated from Godly behavior. It was a  living dread that infested every nook and cranny within the aged walls that shared more in common with a prison than a school. 

The room was said to be the resting place of the sleeping nun. Nobody knew how long she had been locked away, what her name was, or if she even had a name. the sleeping nun never spoke, never woke, she never even moved. She remained in a perpetual state of sleep at all times. They said that she was gifted with the sight, she could see directly into a sinner's heart, without ever opening her eyes. This was something that could only happen once the disobedient went to sleep....There was even a song the girls sang amongst themselves.

"The sleeping nun lies locked away, confess your sins or else you'll pay. Don't stray from God, don't leave his feet, don't close your eyes, don't go to sleep."

In the days that followed, Ruth continued to insist that we confess our sins, in the hope that the Sisters would have mercy on us. Refused, never fearing that our actions would carry any serious reproductions. Two nights later, I awoke to find multiple Sisters holding me down while they placed a bag over my head. I could feel them dragging me from the bed... Dragging me out of the room while they chanted bible verses in unison. This continued for what felt like a lifetime. I would eventually get thrown down onto a hard surface.

After a few minutes of silence, I took the sack off my head. The Sisters would be nowhere to be found.

I was laying on the cold, damp floor. The interior of a room that reminded me of a dimly lit dungeon. The only light came from a single, flickering candle that swayed back and fourth on an antique nightstand... The stand was positioned only a few feet away from a dilapidated bed. A putrid looking mattress held in place by a rusted, metal bedframe.

As hideous as the bed was, it would be the figure, laying at its center that flushed me with an immediate sense of indescribable terror. It was an old woman, a nun.... Older than anyone I had ever seen. Older than anything living should ever look. Her habit was perfectly pressed as if someone put a continuous effort into the resting nun's appearance. Thin, twig shaped arms rested on the nun's flat chest. This image invoked memories of a mummy on display in a museum. 

If I hadn't been paying close enough attention to see that her midsection have just the slightest indication that she wasn't a corpse. My attention would suddenly be diverted towards a dark corner of the room, where another figure sat in an upward fetal position. It was Ruth... She had gone to the Sisters about what happened between us, only they weren't as forgiving as she thought they'd be.

Before I could rush to the door, Ruth disclosed the fact that the door was bolted from the other side. We were trapped. Ruth was worse than I had ever seen her, she repeated the same words over and over again "We can't go to sleep" she said through gritted teeth, "we can never go to sleep". 

We were locked in the room for two days without food or water we stayed up for as long as we could over that 48 hour period,  watching over each other like hawks. I didn't know what would happen if we went to sleep, I just knew the look in Ruth's eyes. It was the same look my Mother gave me that night my father was trying to rape her...

It was helpless fear. That look kept me awake for as long as my body allowed. In the end, fear wouldn't be enough. We tried, we fought, and we inevitably failed. Ruth was the first to drift away, I'd follow soon after. 

My eyes closed for what felt like a second, when I opened them again, I was no longer in that moldy cellar. I was inside of a massive cathedral, laying on a wooden cross. Thousands of candles burned around me like a dancing inferno.

I tried to move but only felt searing pain at every end of my body. As the haze cleared I screamed... Both my arms and my legs had been bolted into the crucifix. Across from me stood Ruth, looking just as panicked as I was. She tried to free me only the nails were too large, they were bolted too deep into the wood. 

Just as Ruth reached the point of exhaustion, we could hear a sound coming from the distance... Clapping... Applause. 

At the end of a clear pathway before us stood the distorted figure that began swiftly moving towards us. It was the sleeping nun, only she was wide awake. Her frail body hunched over as she got closer and closer. Even more frightening was how she managed to move so fast. One glance at the floor revealed that the nun's feet never touched the ground... She was hovering above the floor, floating with the speed of a sprinting adult. 

Her face was contorted into a disgusting, grin while her baby hands continued to smash against each other. Ruth dropped to her knees crying when the nun's feet finally hit the floor. With her face finally visible under the candlelight, I could see that the eyes looking down at us were blank white spheres that almost seemed to glimmer.

"Please, forgive us... Tell God to forgive us." Ruth squealed while holding back an onslaught of tears. 

The Nun reached down, extending a single finger to lift Ruth's head up towards her.

"Oh, my child." The nun whispered "there is no God here... Only me."

I screamed at the top of my lungs, telling Ruth to get away, but my words moved through the air like tar.  Before Ruth could say anything else, the nun opened her mouth, her jaw extended downward, beyond that which was physically possible. Hundreds of small, black worms spewed from the nun's mouth, coating Ruth's body with a layer of squirming darkness. 

I then watched as the worms began to burrow into Ruth's exposed skin. Her face, her chest, her arms.  Ruth's screams were muffled under the black mass invading her body. 

Once all the worms had completed their task, Ruth stood when she opened her eyes they were just as white as the nun's, who's smile had only widened.

"And the abomination shall be consumed by the sin." The nun said at the top of her lungs. Ruth smiled as well, exposing a mouthful of rusted, metal teeth. The nun placed her hand on Ruth's shoulder "now go give her what she wants". The nun whispered.

Ruth walked toward me. I tried to speak to her but nothing would snap her out of the trance. I struggled while she lifted up my dress. Moments after her head disappeared from my sight, I felt a surge of inconceivable Pain radiating outward from my groin.

I could feel every bite, every fleshy rip, every tear as Ruth tore into me like a wild animal. After a while, I couldn't even scream. The pain was so overwhelming, all I could do was lay there In silence as Ruth continued to move deeper into my body. Once her teeth breached the bottom of my stomach, the nun would lay her hand on my forehead before whispering into my ear.

"All dirty girls must pay a price." She'd say before kissing my cheek. Her hot breath reeked of decay and sulfur. 

This would happen over and over again. Once Ruth finished ripping me apart. We'd wake up at the very start of it all. The same scenario repeating itself for an incalculable amount of time. It was only after I gave up all hope that I'd wake back up in my bed as if nothing had ever happened. 

The Sisters told us that we had hallucinated the whole thing. I never challenged their claims, I just carried out the rest of my time at St. Alda's in perfect obedience. Ruth and I would never speak of what happened that night... 

We barely spoke at all in those following years. When you put enough time between something, truth becomes indistinguishable from fiction. After a while, I convinced myself that I had made the whole thing up also. This led to even more years of therapy and prescription drugs. I went through life with the unshakable feeling that I left something at that school.... Something that I'd never be able to reclaim.

Eventually, I'd pull myself from underneath my father's thumb. In the traditional fashion, I hooked up with the wrong people and became a full blown addict. Years later into the fever dream that had become my life, I was contacted by The Congressman. He had been diagnosed with cancer.

As much as the thought of the old bastard wasting away gave me a semblance of joy, I still agreed to see him one last time on his deathbed. He told me that he knew all along about the events that transpired at St. Alda's, and that he was truly sorry for what happened to me there... He would die three days later.

With a renewed sense of validation, knowing that my experience wasn't some fabrication, I went online and buried myself In research, trying to find anything I could on St. Alda's. Every path I found led to a dead end. 

It would be by sheer chance that I'd come across an obscure newspaper article detailing how the school had been closed down for years due to a problem with funding. A week later, I took a trip to St. Alda's. What I found was an empty husk ensnared by overgrowth, a mausoleum of broken spirits. 

I don't know what I was looking for within those abandoned walls, maybe some sort of closure. What I did find was a secret staircase hidden behind a shelf in the pantry. My heart tightened as I descended those creaking steps... Deep down, a part of me knew where I was heading. 

My instincts proved correct when I encountered a wooden door at the bottom of the dust covered floor. The door was unlocked, slightly propped open. The room was just as I remembered it. Everything thing was just as it was.... 

The sleeping nun lay in the corner. A single, flickering candle illuminating her chest silently moving up and down as it had been all those years ago. I was frozen in a state of shock... 

It was in that instant, that everything faded into the back of my mind. Suddenly I was less concerned with the "whys" and "hows" of her being there. The only "How" I cared about in that moment was how fast could I get to the canister of turpentine that I'd remember passing on my way down.

 It would be that instant obsession that freed me from my mental restraints. I ran and grabbed the turpentine when I returned, I'd be overtaken with a newfound sense of strength. The balance of power had shifted, and I gained the upper hand. I soaked that bitch with every once of the liquid... She never even flinched. When the canister was empty, I used the candle on the nightstand to light the hideous cunt up like a Christmas tree. 

Even as the fire began to consume her body, I'd never see even the slightest indication from the sleeping nun. She just laid there... She laid there while I watched. I stood there until the lashing flames and noxious fumes  prevented me from doing so. 

I left St. Alda's that day a new woman. In the midst of smoke that I watched rise from that hidden room, I found the strength to take back what I had lost. I quit the party scene. It was the first step of many to get my excuse of a life back on track. I started going to NA meetings, found a decent job... I even enrolled in some online college courses. Things were moving in the direction I needed them to...

Then I started seeing HER. 

It started exactly one year from the day that I set the sleeping nun on fire. The sightings were rare in the beginning, I'd see her out the corner of my eye. I wrote it off as bad nerves, perhaps my mind was playing tricks on me.  Then I began to see her everywhere, at work, on the bus, in the mirror... Those white eyes...Always watching, those crooked lips always smiling. 

The dreams started a week ago. Every night without fail, the dreams would always be the same. I was back in that cathedral... I was standing over my teenage self, still pinned to that crucifix. The teen me would yell and scream, but the result would always be the same. The nun would walk up behind me, she'd place a knife in my hand then whisper in my ear.
 "Show the little whore how we treat sinners."

She'd then guide my hand down... She'd make me mutilate myself. As horrible as this dream was, the part that scares me to my absolute core, is that when I'm cutting into that version of me that existed over a decade ago... I enjoy it.

I haven't been to sleep in nearly two days. You can thank my co-worker's Adderall subscription for that. This drug related paranoia is only accentuating the feelings of uncertainty I now carry.  Every day since I started seeing her again, I wonder if this is even real... I can't help but humor the possibility that I'm still down there in the room... Down there with her...

 For now, I'm wide awake anticipating this text message and all that it entails....  I gave up on God long ago, but that doesn't stop me from praying..... Pray that I'm no longer at St. Alda's... That Yuri is able to come through tonight.... Pray that when I close my eyes next, it'll be the last time.
