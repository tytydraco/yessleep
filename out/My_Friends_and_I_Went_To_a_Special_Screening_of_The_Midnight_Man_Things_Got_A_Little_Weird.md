A tingle crept down my spine after the doorbell went off. I was finishing getting ready in my cat girl Halloween costume. 
   
Weird… I hadn’t been expecting any trick-or-treaters to come by yet. It was only four o’clock and the porch light hadn’t been turned on. The doorbell rang again.
   
I made my way to the front door. A third ring of the doorbell told me that whoever was out there wasn’t leaving. Grabbing a candy filled bowl, I opened the door, ready to pass out candy to greedy little children. A confusing sight met my gaze. Nobody was at the door. The porch was devoid of any life, including my failed attempts at aesthetically pleasing hanging house plants.
  
A floorboard creaked somewhere in the house. Feeling a little freaked, I turned to look behind me. Nobody was there. I turned back to the porch.
 
“Trick or Treat!” A man in a Jason Vorhees costume yelled at me, materializing out of nowhere. I punched the masked man square in the face, dropping the bowl of candy in the process.
  
The mask fell off, revealing a familiar face. “OW! Christ, Claire, it’s me, Noah!” 

“Noah?!” I questioned, “What the *hell* are you doing here? I thought Kristy and I were meeting you at the movie theater?”
  
I took a second to appreciate my friend's Halloween costume. Noah wore dark blue jeans, a black t-shirt, and a dark green coat. His sandy brown hair was teased to look unruly. He wielded a fake bloody machete. As I looked into his blue eyes, I saw he had a bruise forming where I struck him.
   
“I thought I’d surprise you and pick you up,” Noah said as he picked his mask off the floor, dusting it off on his jeans, “but I’m the one that got surprised. Claire, you have one hell of a right hook, you know that?” 
  
“Serves you right for sneaking up on me like that!” I started picking up the stray pieces of candy and placed them back in the bowl. Noah joined me on the floor. Once all the candy was picked up, I grabbed my coat and met Noah out on the porch. 
 
“My car?” I asked. Noah shrugged. The car purred to life as I turned my key in the ignition. I backed out of my family’s driveway and headed in the direction of my best friend Kristy’s house.  

Noah, Kristy, and I have been friends since childhood. Kristy and I became friends after she threw a dodge ball at my bully’s face in the fourth grade. Noah was my bully. When Kristy was finished with him, Noah was crying and begging for my forgiveness. I thought Kristy following him around and terribly singing “Baby” by Justin Bieber was hilarious, but punishment enough, and eventually forgave him. Noah still shudders every time he hears it come on the radio.
   
Kristy reluctantly let Noah join our friend group, but kept a watchful eye on him until he gained her trust. As for why Noah bullied me, he was having some trouble at home and decided to take it out on me. Deep down he was a good kid, he just needed to vent his frustrations.
 
To be fair I was an easy target as a kid. Reserved, wore glasses frames that were too big for my face, preferred to read at recess instead of play- usual nerdy loner kid things. I’m just glad things turned out the way they did. I couldn’t ask for any better friends than them.  

Kristy was outside waiting in her driveway when I pulled up. She was wearing a sexy she-devil costume with red leather pants and a tight red crop top that looked more like a bra.There was a matching tail clipped to the back of her pants and a headband with devil horns nestled on top of her long silky blonde hair. On top of all that she wore bright red three inch stiletto heels. She looked cold.

“Finally!” She shouted as she got in, leaning over to the dashboard where she cranked the heat. “I’m freezing!”  

Kristy saw my cat makeup. “What the hell, Claire? I thought we were going to match?!”  

“Sorry Kristy, but you know my parents,” I said, with a shrug.

Annoyed, Kristy blew a tuft of hair out of her face and slumped in the back seat as I pulled out of her driveway.    
  
“God I can’t believe how lucky we are!” Noah geeked next to me as we neared our town's local movie theater. “A Halloween screening of The Midnight Man, back in select theaters one night only!”  

Kristy groaned as Noah started talking about his all time favorite obscure horror movie, The Midnight Man. It’s some old 2010s teen slasher horror movie about these kids that supposedly summon some entity at a Halloween party that kills people. At least that's what Noah says, I’ve never seen it before.  

“Why do we need to go see this movie when Noah explained the whole plot a bajillion times already? You’ve basically seen it, Claire. Noah made me watch it with him once. The movie was crap!” 
 
An offended expression made itself known on Noah’s face. “It was not!  

“Because he’s our friend, Kristy,” I intervened, “that’s why! Besides, I’m excited to see it.” 
 
“The plot twist isn’t even that good.” Kristy mumbled.  

“What was the plot twist again? I forgot what Noah said it was."

Noah shushed me,“We’re about to go see the movie, there’s no point in telling you now! Experience it for yourself.” 
 
If there was one thing Noah took seriously in life, it was his movies. 
  
A late October breeze blew through the parking lot. Kristy booked it to the entrance. I zipped up my jacket. Noah wrapped his arms around himself for extra warmth. The parking lot was empty. Unusual for Halloween in our town, which was filled with horror movie fanatics crawling out of their dank dwellings to watch the latest releases. Despite the bad feeling swelling in my gut, I brushed it off.  

The inside was seemingly deserted.   

“Anybody home?” Kristy asked as she tapped her fingers on the empty concessions counter. 
  
“Are they closed for the night?” I asked.  

“They better not be!” Noah exclaimed, taking out his phone. “It said on the website they were showing a screening of The Midnight Man here tonight, in twenty minutes.”   

Noah’s phone was suddenly shoved in my face. Displayed on the screen was the movie theater’s website, just like he had said, a notice for the special screening of the movie was being advertised on there.   

“Isn’t there a bell we can ring for service?” Kristy leaned against the concessions counter. 
 
“This isn’t a hotel, Kristy.”
   
She shrugged and started snooping around.
  
I spoke up. “Maybe we can go back to my place and stream it instead, Noah?”  

He shook his head. I knew how much he cared about this. It was almost unhealthy the way he talked about going to see it since he found out it was coming back to theaters. 
 
A woman wearing the theater’s uniform emerged from the employee’s only door. “Sorry about the wait,” she went behind the concessions counter, “all the theaters are absolutely packed right now!” 
 
She had pale skin and her obsidian-colored hair was cut into an awful bob that ended just past her chin. Her eyes were a glassy shade of gray and her lipstick shade was blood red. She gave off weird vibes. Perfect for the holiday.

I glanced out to the empty parking lot. There were only two other vehicles parked out there. “Yeah, sure…’ 

“I love your Halloween costumes!” 

We thanked her politely. 
 
“Three tickets for The Midnight Man, please!” Noah asked, his mood severely improved from a second ago. He was practically vibrating from his excitement.  
 
“Any refreshments?”  
 
“Three soda’s and a large bucket of popcorn, *extra* butter,” 

The woman nodded her head curtly and finished typing in our order. She handed Kristy three cups and told us our total. “That’ll be thirty-five dollars, sir.”  

Noah took out his wallet and paid. She started preparing our popcorn after putting the cash in her till. We filled our drinks and she gave Noah the popcorn with a smile. "Theater thirteen. It’s to your left just down the hall and it’s the last door on the right,” she instructed.  

Noah eagerly led us to our destination. “Thank you miss! Have a nice night,” 
“Enjoy the show!” She suddenly yelled creepily, for some reason maintaining direct eye contact with only me the whole time we were still in view.  

“We will!” Noah shouted back. Something about the way she looked at me gave me the willies.

Kristy elbowed me. She leaned down and whispered into my ear, “What a creep that lady was, right?”   

A warmth filled my stomach as I let out a voracious laugh in agreement. I was glad I wasn’t the only one who got bad vibes from her. She laughed with me as we walked. Noah would periodically look behind him to see if we were okay with how hard we bellowed. Eventually, we made it to theater thirteen, a digital display above the door confirming the movie and showtime.  

Theater thirteen was completely empty. The seats were barren, The screen was blank, and no previews were playing. But hey, at least the light’s were on.  

“They must not have turned the projector on yet,” Noah said, running to snag the best seats in the theater, “and we’re the first one’s here!” He chose the seats right in the middle of the room. Kristy and I took a seat on opposite sides besides him.   

“Maybe they won’t play any previews!” Kristy said, hopefully. She never did like staying still for too long. 
 
We took a minute to settle in and get comfortable. Noah checked his watch. It was almost six. “They should’ve started the movie by now.”     

Then, as if on cue, the lights dimmed and the blank screen roared to life, the beginning movie credits began flashing on and off screen as ominous music started playing through the surround sound. I as the door was locked behind us. Seemed like it would just be the three of us watching this showing of The Midnight Man.
  
Noah shushed us as we all nestled comfortably into our seats as the hour and a half long film started. I had to say, despite how odd stuff was leading up to us being in that moment, I was pretty pumped to watch the movie.  

My moment of peace was interrupted as something strange happened after the beginning credits finished. The screen seemed to glitch and then went blank entirely.  

“Huh?” Kristy squinted her eyes at the screen.
  
“What now?” Noah grunted out in frustration, almost chucking the popcorn bucket to the ground. 

“Guys, I don’t like this!”
   
Suddenly the movie screen flashed again and everything was enveloped in a white hot blinding blast.  

When my vision returned after the light faded back down, our surroundings had changed. We were no longer in a movie theater, but back in my car. It was the middle of the night outside and we were parked on the side of a road that had woods on either side. There was a line of cars parked in front of us as other kids our age in Halloween costumes walked up the road.  

The air felt electric as we got out of the car. It felt like we were out of place. Outsiders.  

“What the hell?” I asked, as if Kristy or Noah would know anything. “Where are we? what time is it!? My parents are going to kill me for being out this late!”  

Kristy gulped, “I don’t think we’re in Kansas anymore.”   

“The fuck?” Noah said as he took in our surroundings. I knew that look on his face. He knew where we were.  

“Noah,” I called, testingly. I couldn’t fathom what his answer was going to be, but somehow, deep down, I already knew.   

“This is the outside of the Kessler Estate,” Noah answered with a tremble to his voice.  

A disbelieving chuckle left Kristy’s mouth as she ran a hand through her hair, a nervous tick of hers. “No. Fucking. Way.”  

The name disturbingly rang a bell. I remembered it from one of Noah’s many rants. “Kessler, as in the same last name of two of the main characters in The Midnight Man? Vannesa and Bryan *Kessler*?!?”  

Noah cleared his throat, “Veronica and Ryan, not Vannesa and Bryan,” he corrected. 
 
“Whatever!” I yelled, freaking out. “The point is, we somehow got sucked into a fucking movie, and not just any movie, a goddamn slasher film!”  

“Oh god,” Kristy cried,” I’m going to die from cringe!”  

I elbowed her in the ribs, “Now’s not the time for that! We need to figure out how to get out of here.”  

Noah started rubbing my shoulder, trying to comfort me.  

“What the hell are we supposed to do now?” I asked. If anybody would have an answer, it would be him. He furrowed his brows as he thought of a solution. 
  
Kristy added her input first. “I think- I think we should just play along? Maybe that’s how we get out of this. If we comply and deal with whatever the being that put us here throws at us, they’ll let us go.”  

“No,” Noah countered. “I think we should go in there and tell the main characters the truth. Tell them they’re in danger and to call call the cops. Nobody has to die, even them.”  

“Oh that’s a brilliant plan, Noah!” Kristy chided. “You’re just going to walk in there and tell them they’re all going to get murdered? Because they totally won’t think you’re some psycho freak and kick you out! Then we’ll all die!”  

Noah turned and leaned closer to Kristy in the back, “Oh and your plan is so much better? My way there’s a chance to save everyone! If we do it your way then someone is bound to die. Do you really want that hanging over your conscience?”  

“It’s better than being dead!” She quipped.  

Noah and Kristy both turned to me and asked in unison, “Claire, what do you think we should do?”   

“You want to pin this on me?!” Despite the obvious panic in my face, my friends looked at me expectantly.   

“Kristy,” I blurt out, “I think we should follow Kristy. Let’s just try to have as quiet a night as possible.” I went with the safest option.

Noah left in anger. We chased after him. He was heading to the party.
  
“You guys don’t know what you’re doing!” He said, kicking dirt. “I’ve seen this movie a thousand times. Kristy’s seen it once and you haven’t seen it at all, Claire. I practically know all of them on a personal level, I know how they’d react!”  

“You can’t really believe that, Noah,” Kristy said, “You’re right, you do know better, so tell me, do you think if you stormed in there right now, before their character development, they would believe everything you’d tell them?”

His shoulders sank and he let out a sigh, “No… I just- don’t want to die!”  

“Neither do we,” I chimed in. “We’re all stressed. Tensions are high. Let’s just go in there and party a bit before we have to deal with an ax wielding murderer.”  

“Knife wielding maniac,” Kristy and Noah both corrected. I laughed and rolled my eyes. Kristy and Noah laughed at my cluelessness.  

I got a good view of the place as we approached the estate. The Kessler’s lived in a three story antebellum style mansion. The building was white with a flat roof and dark blue accents. The front doors were propped wide open for guests to come and go as they pleased. Spooky Halloween music blasted inside.

“If you run into one of the main characters, just be yourself,” Kristy said, taking the lead. She looked to Noah. “*Don’t* say anything about what we know, under any circumstances, got it?”  

“Got it,” he replied, stuffing his hands into his coat. He went back to his kicked puppy demeanor. 
 
“Can somebody remind me who the main characters are please? I don’t know who I’m looking out for,” I felt out of the loop.
  
Noah perked up and Kristy rolled her eyes. “Okay, so there’s five people to look out for. Veronica and Ryan are brother and sister, Ryan being the youngest, and only sensible person within the group. He acts as the voice of reason. Then there’s Beck Hunter, Veronica's boyfriend. She’s the bitchy head cheerleader and he’s the star quarterback.”  

“Cringe!” Kristy said, trying to hide it in a cough. “So cringe.”  

“It’s not my fault the movie is full of stereotypes,” Noah said, defending himself. “Anyway,” he continued explaining, “then there’s Selina Cortez. She’s a total airhead, and also happens to be Veronica’s best friend. She’s also the first one to die, that’s important.”  

“Typical,” Kristy scoffed, “of course the only person of color is killed first.”
  
Noah shrugged at the mention of the classic horror movie cliche. “Last, but not least, we have Brynn Fields. She’s a goth and the group looks to her for guidance once the killings start. Her and Ryan get close during the movie. They trauma bond and get together in the end. They’re the only ones that survive.”  

“We should totally stick close to them,” Kristy suggested in a whisper. Noah nodded his head, agreeing with her.  
 
“Okay,” a feeling of anxiety washed over me as we reached the front porch. A wild party full of kids about to die raged inside.  

Kristy was the first one to go in, then Noah. He waited for me to gather enough courage to step into the house. I hesitated, but eventually crossed the threshold. The three of us entered the teen filled foyer and pushed our way deeper inside.  

“C’mon let’s go find something to drink,” Noah said, leading me away. 

I suddenly bumped into someone’s back, causing them to spill their drink. 
  
“Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry!” I apologized, grabbing some nearby napkins and handing them to the guy I bumped into. Noah let go of my hand amongst the commotion. His eyes went wide when he saw who I was talking to. He was tall, had short brown hair and eyes, and the deepest dimples when he smiled. He was wearing some loafers, tan pants, and a black turtleneck.  

“It’s okay, accidents happen,” he grabbed the napkins and dabbing them on his wet clothes.  

“Nice Steve Jobs costume!” I complimented him. 
 
“Oh, actually-”  

Noah suddenly pushed me out of the way. “I apologize for my friend, she can be quite clumsy. Norman Bates, right? Killer costume!”  

I shot him a look since he practically dragged me into the guy.   

The guy smiled. “Ah, I see what you did there! Thanks for recognizing the costume, it’s quite refreshing. People have been mistaking me for Steve Jobs all night."

“Love the Jason costume by the way. You guys enjoy the rest of the party,” he said before walking off and mingling with other guests.  

I gave Noah a ‘what the fuck was that?’ look.  

“Claire, that was Ryan Kessler! A running gag throughout the movie was that people kept mistaking him for Steve Jobs instead of Norman Bates.”  

“Ohhhh,” I realized,” that’s how-”
  
“Yes! Hopefully we didn’t just fuck everything up.”  

“Why?” My heart started racing at his reaction.  

“Ryan and Brynn first meet after he spills his drink all over himself. Brynn helps him clean up and knows who he’s dressed as. We practically just stole their first interaction!” 
 
A pit formed in my stomach. Kristy made her way back over to us, already buzzed. She didn’t seem to feel the same existential dread Noah and I were.  
 
“Hear ye, hear ye, our queen vampiress has something to say!” Someone in a Dracula costume suddenly announced from the top of the grand staircase that sat in the middle of the house, banging a spoon on a glass to get everyone’s attention.  
 
A girl wearing a stunning dark red ball gown and black cape appeared next to the other vampire guy. Her hair was pinned up in a very elegant bun and most of her face was hidden behind a Victorian masquerade mask. She looked like she was getting ready to say something important.  

“That’s Veronica Kessler,” Noah whispered. “That’s Beck standing next to her. They’re dressed in matching vampire couple’s costumes.”   

I nodded my head, thankful for the heads up. “Is that Selena?” I asked, pointing to the girl in a zombie cheerleader costume next to Veronica. She had sunkissed skin, green eyes, a distinctive mole resting on her right cheek. Her dirty blonde hair was pulled into two curly pigtails.   

Noah patted me on the shoulder, “Look at you catching on!” 
  
“Happy Halloween Bellmont High! Are you having a good time or what?” Veronica cheered loudly.  

Whoops, whistles, and cheers came from the crowd. “It wouldn’t be a Halloween party without a spooky story would it?” 
 
Riled up, the crowd collectively yelled, “No!” 

Kristy suddenly poked me in the side then whispered, “I’ve got to use the ladies room, come with?”  

I nodded my head and went to tell Noah where we were going, but he was too engrossed in Veronica’s speech. I shrugged and followed Kristy to the nearest bathroom.
 
“God, I gotta shit so bad!” Kristy said, slamming the door closed and locking it. 
 
I could still hear Veronica’s muffled speech while I waited outside the bathroom door.  
 
“Thirty years ago,” Veronica began in a creepy tone, “in this very house, way before the Kessler’s owned the property, a woman was brutally murdered! Bludgeoned to death during a home invasion gone wrong.”  

I found myself inching back towards the living room, interested in the story. I lingered at the entrance of the hallway, getting a good side view of the party. 
 
“That’s nothing!” Someone shouted from the crowd. Then a short, but spunky, woman made her way up the grand staircase. “Just history. Know what’s *really* scary?”  

I deduced this was Brynn Fields. She was dressed head-to-toe in black. She wore a black t-shirt with a skull graphic on it, black acid wash jeans, black and white converse high tops. She had long onyx colored hair that was styled in a wolf cut. She was a pretty hot goth.   

She nudged Veronica out of the way. “The Midnight Man!”  

Veronica rolled her eyes and pushed Brynn out of her spot. “Don’t tell me you actually believe in that bed time story!”
  
Brynn’s expression hardened. “It’s not a bedtime story.” 
 
“I’m pretty sure an evil spirit that takes naughty children’s eyeballs after midnight qualifies as a bedtime story,” Beck retorted. 
 
“I’m telling you, it’s not a bedtime story!” 
 
“Fine, if you’re so sure, why don’t we summon him, then?” Veronica said slyly. “It is almost Midnight.”  

“You should not do that.” Brynn warned.
  
Veronica grabbed Brynn, “Why not? Suddenly a skeptic, Ghost Girl?”
  
“Fine, your funeral,” she then ran back down the stairs and disappeared into the crowd. Selena and Beck burst out laughing, cracking jokes at Brynn’s expense. Veronica pulled her blackberry phone out and searched for something on it.  
 
“The Midnight Man, The Midnight Man, come take thy children away,” she started chanting. The room went silent and a chill crept down my spine. “For they are naughty kids and bratty kids who stay up way too late. The Midnight Man, The Midnight Man, lurks in the shadows and shrieks and growls, looking for his prey. Once the clock strikes twelve on the witching hour, he takes the eyes of children with souls oh so sour. Beware, beware, The Midnight Man.”  

The room stayed eerily silent for a minute after Veronica’s big spectacle. Then everyone started laughing and cheering as the party roared back to life. It was clear nobody believed in The Midnight Man.  

Selena walked past me, making a b-line for the bathroom. She turned the doorknob but found it locked. She tried it again, but it still didn’t open.  

“Occupied!” Kristy yelled from inside. Selena groaned, flipped Kristy off, and stormed off in search of another bathroom.  

Then a scream came from the bathroom. I whipped my head around and ran to check on my friend. Kristy came out of the bathroom, eyes wide and terrified. She was breathing hard. “RUN!!!”  

A shadow emerged from within the bathroom, something glinted from its hand, a knife.  Kristy started running and so did I. A loud thud sound from behind me. I turned around and saw Kristy had fallen. “OW, my ankle!” Kristy cried, grasping at her high heels. “Stupid fucking horror movie cliches!”  

Kristy started fumbling with her shoes, trying to take them off. I ran back towards her. Kristy looked back and came face to face with the shadow. She yelped and the shadow lunged for her! It raised the knife and stabbed it through Kristy’s eye. My stomach sank and she bellowed out a blood curdling scream. 
 
“Claire, run!” The other knife then plunged into her remaining eye.  
 
Doing as she said, I got up and ran for the nearest open door. I cowered in a dark coat closet as I heard the killer stab Kristy’s corpse over and over again.His footsteps slowly approached the closet. I scrunched my eyes shut as hard as I could. He stood there for what felt like forever, breathing hard and heavy. Then he just walked away.   

I left the closet and dry heaved, seeing the carnage that was done to Kristy’s body. I screamed and sobbed while running back into the living room. Noah quickly found me and asked what was wrong. Everyone else in the room stared at me. I choked out, “Kristy is dead! The Midnight Man killed her!”  
***
Chaos erupted in the mansion and everyone made a run for the door, scared for their lives. The front doors slammed shut, leaving only Veronica, Ryan, Selena, Beck, Brynn, Noah, and myself. Beck ran to the door and tried tugging it open, but it wouldn’t budge.  

“H-how did this happen?” Noah asked me, looking at the white sheet we’d used to cover her body. 
 
“She ran out of the bathroom and a shadow chased her down. She tripped in her heels and The Midnight Man stabbed her eyes out!” I explained, feeling tears welling up in my eyes.  

“Thank god I didn’t use that bathroom,” Selena sighed in relief. I stared flaming daggers at her.
  
Noah’s face went pale. He grabbed my shoulder and we walked away from the rest of the group. “That was supposed to be Selena! The killer was hiding in the shower and chased her out of the bathroom where she tripped and he stabbed her eyes out. This is bad, Claire!”
  
I covered my mouth, holding back a scream. Kristy died in Selena’s place?!

“Who are you guys anyway?” Veronica called out to Noah and I. We disbanded our huddle and rejoined the group. “We know everybody at school and we’ve never seen you before.” 
 
“I’m Noah, that’s Claire. Our friend over there was Kristy. We’re… exchange students!” Noah said, making a lie up on the spot. 
 
“Exchange students from where?” Ryan asked, intrigued.   

Noah and I gave each other a nervous glance.  

“Canada.”  

“Newfoundland.”  

The group looked at us confused. 
  
“Newfoundland, Canada,” Noah and I recovered.  

“We’re from Newfoundland, which is in Canada,” I explained awkwardly.  

The rest of the group seemed to buy it. 
 
“What do you mean The Midnight Man killed your friend?” Ryan asked. 

“It looked like a shadow, I guess?”  

Brynn laughed, “I told you he wasn’t a bedtime story!”  

“That’s impossible,” Noah said, playing with his hands.   

“What makes you say that?” Brynn asked, “She said a shadow killed your friend.” 
 
“Call it a feeling,” Noah replied ominously. 
  
“We’re trapped!” Beck said, rejoining us in the living room. “All the doors and windows won’t open.”  

“And the phone line must’ve been cut!” Selena cried out, tapping on her phone rapidly.   

“That’s fantastic! We’re stuck in the middle of nowhere with a killer on the loose!” Veronica cried.  

“Let’s just stay calm, alright? There’s another way out of here.” Ryan said, trying to calm his sister down. “I’m going to look for it.”  

“Be careful, Ryan,” Veronica yelled after her brother. “Mom and dad will kill me if you die!”  

“Claire, can I talk to you?” Noah asked, dragging me away again. The Midnight Man cast started talking among themselves, it seemed like they were talking about splitting up. Another horror movie cliche that wouldn’t end well.   

“What is it, Noah?” I sniffled. 
 
“I didn’t want to spoil it earlier, but the plot twist is that The Midnight Man doesn’t exist. The killer is Howard Wilcox, an escaped mental patient. He went crazy after his wife was killed. This used to be his house! In his mind he still lives here and they were the intruders that broke into his house. He killed them for revenge! The movie was supposed to symbolize how man is scarier than the paranormal.”  

“Then why did he look like a shadow?” I started to hyperventilate.
  
“Because that’s how he first appears in the movie, as a shadow,” Noah explained. 

“H-how do we stop him? What did they do in the movie?”  

“Brynn was used as bait, luring him out by throwing insults about his wife, and when he revealed himself, Ryan snuck up on him and killed him.”  

I let out a sigh of relief.  

“We need to tell them the truth, Claire. We can make this stop.”  

An unsettling scream came from upstairs. We ran to check on Ryan.  

Beck noticed a shadow down the hall as we reached the top of the stairs. He and Noah both chased after it.  

“*Kate~*” It disappeared behind a corner.
  
Us girls found Ryan’s body halfway out the door of a random bedroom. His eyes had been stabbed out, just like Kristy’s. His face was frozen with an expression of terror on it. Veronica screamed and started cradling his body in her arms. “Ryan, no!” 
 
“The Midnight Man got him,” Brynn said, somberly.  

They returned a second later, Beck shaking his head. The shadow killer had dissipated into thin air.  

“That was Wilcox,” Noah whispered in my ear, “Kate was his wife.”  

“Ryan's,” I relayed. He stared at the body behind me, slack jawed.   

“No!” Noah started freaking out, “This isn’t right, it isn’t supposed to happen like this!”  

“Noah, calm down!” 

“Can’t you see? We’re changing everything just by being here! We’re screwing with the plot and the order people die in!”  

“You don’t think I don’t know that, you shithead?” I whisper-yelled back at him. “My best friend is dead! Kristy was murdered right in front of me!”  
 
The remaining surviving cast were staring at us. Veronica looked at him with murderous intent.  

“What do you mean, ‘it wasn’t supposed to happen like this’?”  

Noah stared at her. “I can’t do this anymore, Claire! They need to know the truth!”  

“Noah,” I said cautiously. There was no telling how they’d react and the outcome it would lead to.  

“Ryan shouldn’t have died! Selena was supposed to die in the bathroom.This was supposed to be Beck,” he pointed to Ryan’s body. “You were the next to die, stabbed to death in the bed after having hot sex with Veronica. Veronica was next, after the killer chased her from the bedroom.”
  
Their eyes went wide. Beck and Veronica held each other close, looking confused and offended as hell. 
 
“I was supposed to die in that bathroom?” Selena asked nervously. “But- but your friend-”  

Beck cracked his knuckles and stepped up to Noah. In comparison, Noah had a few extra inches on him. He didn’t look like it in his costume, but Noah was built and pretty strong. Beck took a step back and his tough guy demeanor fell away when Noah cracked his neck. “How could you even know that?”  

“I know because The Midnight Man isn’t-” Noah started.  

“He’s a psychic!” Brynn yelled excitedly, interrupting him. “That must be how! He can see the future!”  

They ate that shit up, all nodding their heads in agreement. I missed Ryan’s clear headedness at that moment.  

There was no way Noah was going to be able to convince them now. Psychics and evil spirits were *much* more believable than a couple of kids somehow getting stuck in a bad horror movie full of c-list actors.  

“Still,” Brynn said, “The Midnight man won’t stop until he has all of our eyes. We need to figure out a way to stop him.” 
 
“How do you propose we do that?” Veronica asked.  

“Yeah, Ghost Girl, tell us what we should do!” Beck followed. 

Selena brought her pointer finger to her chin. “We should do something to try and appease his spirit! If it stops being angry at us, it’ll leave us alone!” 
 
“Yes,” Brynn agreed, “and it should have something to do with Noah! His psychic aura is thick and powerful, The Midnight Man must be attracted to it!” 
 
“What are you going to do,” I scoffed sarcastically, “sacrifice him?”  
 
A sadistic smile formed on Brynn’s lips as her eyes glinted with wild excitement.  
***
“Thanks, Claire, thanks a lot,” Noah chided as Beck and Selena bound his hands and feet with rope to the legs of an overturned coffee table in the living room. “You and your big mouth!”  

“Dude, I didn’t think they were going to take me seriously!” I yelled back in defense. Veronica had me restrained on the couch.   

“You should know better by now!” Beck stuffed a sock in his mouth. 
 
“God, Noah, I’m sorry!” I cried, trying to escape out of my bonds.  

Brynn came out of the kitchen, holding a sharp knife.  

“Aren't there some more occultish things we should do, first?” Beck asked. “Draw a pentagram, light a candle?”  

“No, not really. A simple chant should do.”   

Everyone else shrugged. Brynn stood over Noah’s chest, raising the knife. I squirmed, trying to somehow free myself. I needed to stop these psychotic idiots! Noah was the only one who knew what was happening.   

“In the name of The Midnight Man,” Brynn yelled, bringing the knife down,“we make this scacrif-!”  

“Fuck that!” Noah shouted, managing to kick one of his legs free. “Self preservation!” He kicked Brynn in the stomach and she dropped her weapon. She keeled over, clutching her abdomen. Noah freed one of his hands and grabbed the knife, quickly sawing the remaining rope off. Brynn lunged for Noah. The two were quickly engaged in a struggle for the knife.   

*Squelch!* The sound of someone being stabbed rang through the room. Everyone went quiet, not knowing who stabbed who. A croak escaped Brynn’s mouth as her skin drained of its color. Noah thrust the knife deeper into the girl’s stomach, causing her to fall on her back. She died choking on her own blood.  

He came and cut the rope that was restraining me. I rubbed my sore wrists, as I stared at Brynn’s dead body. Everything had happened so fast. Realizing what he’d just done, Noah threw the knife away from him, as if the handle had burned him like a hot iron. He stood there, looking at me. I tried to convey to him that everything was going to be okay. 
 
Beck grabbed the knife off the floor while we were distracted.   

“In the name of The Midnight Man, we make this sacrifice!”   

“Noah, NO!” I screamed, lunging for his faltering body. I caught him just as his weight tumbled to the ground. Beck had quite literally stabbed Noah in the back.  

“C-claire!” he whispered, the life already starting to dim in his eyes. He pulled the knife out of his back with a groan. “I love you. I always have.”  

I wept in his chest as it slowly stopped rising. He shuddered his last breath and then he was gone. I kissed him on the lips then closed his eyelids, “I love you too!”   

The knife fell out of Noah’s hands, which had gone stiff and cold. I grabbed it. I stood up and waved it around, pointing it between the remaining characters. 

"I’ll kill you all!” I screamed like a mad woman, wiping stray tears off my face. “The Midnight Man isn’t real you fucking mornons! The killer is Howard Wilcox!”  

A sudden creak came from upstairs. We all looked up to see the killer. The shadow slowly started fading, revealing the Howard Wilcox! He made a sprint for the stairs.  

“SCATTER!” Veronica yelled. 

Everyone split up and went to different parts of the mansion. I ran for the kitchen.  

Of course, out of everyone else, he came after me!  A sharp pain came from the back of my arm as he slashed his knife at me. I tried to run faster. Wilcox quickly caught up and grabbed my hair. I thrashed, trying to disarm him. He threw me to the ground, my face smacking against the tiled floor.   

He turned me around and straddled me. I tried to wiggle out of his grasp, but his grip was too strong. He raised his knife. Suddenly, Wilcox began choking. His face went red as spit flew out of his mouth. He clawed at his chest before his lips went blue, his full body weight falling on top of me. His murder weapon clanged to the ground, sliding across the floor. I yelped, looking into his dead eyes. I pushed his large frame off of me and scrambled away from his limp body. 
 
I kicked him with my foot, but he didn’t stir.   

Everyone came and found me in the kitchen.  

“You killed the killer!” Selena cheered.  

“Actually, I think he had a heart attack,” I explained, “all the excitement must’ve gotten to him.”  

“I don’t care how he died,” Veronica said, picking up the knife. She stabbed in his eye and spit on his corpse. Just as long as he’s dead. That was for Ryan, motherfucker.”  

Selena kicked him in the nards, “That was for Kirsten!” she said, flipping off the dead body.
  
“Kristy,” I corrected.   

”Let’s get out of here!”  

The four of us made our way out of the mansion, I left first, the three of them trailed closely behind.  

We basked in the light of the full moon and cherished the night’s fresh air. I focused on the wind blowing on my skin.  

“So, same time next Halloween?” Selena asked in a happy and preppy tone.  

The three of them burst out laughing at the bad joke. I didn’t say anything, figuring that was probably the last line of the movie or something.  

Selena’s bubbly laughter suddenly stopped. She resembled a deer caught in headlights. Her eyes went wide as she stared at the woods in front of her. Her skin went pale and she began to choke up.  

I looked around, not seeing anything.  
 
“Selena?” 
  
*Pop!* Selena screamed as one of her eyeballs suddenly popped out of its sockets, being pulled by an invisible force. Sinew and muscle tissue binding the eyeball to her skull snapped, thrusting her head back. *Pop!* Went the other eye. Selena’s body suddenly fell limp. Two bloody and gaping holes were left in place where her eyes should be. 
 
“You said he wasn’t real!” Veronica sobbed as Beck started choking next. A dark, spectral looking figure, made itself known. “You said The Midnight Man wasn’t real!”  

“Help me!”  
 
*Pop, pop, thud!*  

Veronica was next. She didn’t have time to grieve as her eyes went red and she clutched her throat, the specter choking her. He reached into her eye sockets and grabbed her eye. She screamed and flailed as he delicately pulled the organ out. He stuffed her blue eye into his pocket before reaching for the other. Veronica’s body fell to the ground after her second eyeball had been plucked.  

I turned and ran for the woods. It appeared in front of me. I froze in fright. Running away wasn’t going to work.  

“*Not from here...,*” It croaked, floating up to me. Its bony finger pointed at my right eye. His hand suddenly gripped my throat, quickly cutting my air supply off.  

“How?” I squeaked out. “How are you here?”  

“*Blood sacrifice!*”  

I whimpered, because of course Noah’s blood sacrifice would summon an evil spirit. I was in a fucking horror movie!  

At least Noah didn't die in vain since TMM saved me.
 
It cackled "*Tell them about me,”* it whispered into my ear before his fingers reached for my eye. I screamed in pain as my right eye burned. I closed my eyelids as hard as I could as one last method of defense.  

Then the pain was gone. Sounds ceased and a cold chill enveloped my body. I opened my eyes slowly. My vision was a little blurry, but it was still there. I brought my hands to my face, examining. Everything appeared to be where it should be. I blinked again and I could see clearly. 

I was alone and back in the lobby of the movie theater. 
 
I ran through the hall of theaters, looking for my friends, taking the same path as earlier. There was no theater thirteen. The highest number it went up to was ten.    

Frantically, I whipped my phone out and went to the theater's website. The advertisement for The Midnight Man showing was gone. Left in its place was a notice that the theater was closed for the holiday due to maintenance.  

I sulked back to the lobby. What was I going to tell their parents? My two best friends in the whole world were missing, their souls trapped in a ghost theater forever!  What was I going to tell *my* parents? 

I was about to exit the theater when a strange sight caught my eye.   

In my left eye I saw the empty concessions counter. My right, I saw the employee from earlier waving goodbye to me, with a big smile on her face.
