“Anyone up for a pint?” Mack grinned.

The minute hand had *literally* just crept past 5pm.

Several hands shot up around the office, including mine.

*Anything was better than going home.*

I glanced over at the new guy, Tony. He seemed the quiet, inoffensive type.

“Fancy a beer?” I asked.

“I’m fine, thanks,” he smiled politely. “Places to be and what not.”

I watched as he tidied his desk, repositioning the picture frame beside his monitor before pulling on his coat. Inside was a photo of a blond and her two kids.

Not wanting to pry, I just smiled.

“No worries - see ya tomorrow.”

A few weeks later, Tony approached me coyly. His hands were behind his back.

“I did something…” he beamed.

“Have you fixed the elevator?” I joked.

To say we’d become friends in the last month would be a stretch, but I’d made an effort to get to know him better.

“It’s a sketch…” he grinned.

Tony held out a sheet of A1 paper, featuring a charcoal drawing of *yours truly*. It was…*really* well done.

Several nearby colleagues peeked over their cubicles. One started sniggering.

“Oh…wow, Tony. That’s so…*thoughtful!*”

My face felt hot with embarrassment.

Mack was creasing hard.

Tony looked around awkwardly. 

“It’s beautiful, Tony,” I exclaimed, stifling a laugh as I stood to shake his hand.

“*Genuinely*. Thanks buddy.”

“What a fucking *weirdo*,” Mack muttered.

Later that week, I was on my way to the kitchenette when I noticed the portrait on Tony’s desk had changed. *Again.*

“New girlfriend?” I ribbed. “You keep yourself busy my friend!”

“Something like that,” he smiled.

“I hear you,” I whispered conspiratorially. “I’m sick to the back teeth of my missus.”

Tony’s smile faded. “Family is a gift, Tim.”

“Mine certainly aren’t,” I shot back. “They’re more of a curse.”

“You should show more respect to your wife,” he stated.

I felt taken aback.

*Preachy fucker*, I thought, walking away.

That was when I decided to spread the rumour that he was a stalker.

\*

Before long, Tony was a pariah.

He was so odd, so ethererally quiet, that it had taken almost no effort to convince people of the lie.

The regular changing of the portraits didn’t help. There’d been a *different family* in the frame as recently as last week.

Things were sure to come to a head tonight, though, when it was just he and I working late.

*I would make sure of it.*

Alone in the office together, I decided the time was nigh and approached him - and lo and behold, the *freak* had put a picture of *my wife and kids* in his goddamned photo frame.

*“What the actual fuck?!”* I spat, chasing him out of the office into the marbled corridor as he made to leave. *“What’s your deal, you absolute freak?!”*

He paused for a moment, weighing his words.

“I’m a guardian angel,” he stated, matter-of-factly. “I protect people.”

“Bullshit! Why do you have a picture of my family on your fucking desk, Tony?”

“Because they need protecting,” he said nonchalantly. *“From you.”*

He took a step towards me and I staggered backwards involuntarily. Suddenly, I found myself balancing right on the threshold of the open elevator shaft. I could feel the taut *caution* tape pressing against my back.

*“Change,”* he said simply. “Or I come back.”

Then he strolled off, whistling cheerily as his head bobbed away down the stairs.

I've not seen him since.
