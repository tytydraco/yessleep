I stood on prickly carpet beside the dusty black furnace in the center of the playroom. I yawned, deeper than I expected to. That made me wonder how late it was. I turned to the clock on the far wall, but couldn't quite make sense of it. So I instead turned behind myself to catch the window, and see how far gone was the daylight.

Sure enough, there was darkness through the pane—but only half. A hand pressed up against the glass, white as the moon. As soon as I'd looked, it was beginning to retreat back across the lawn. An arm and a face followed it. The thing was smiling wide, with lips curling up past its nose. It took a moment of it walking backwards for the flat humming lights above me to fail in reaching it, once it had crossed beyond the barn in the backyard.

My back tingled up into my throat. I worried I was going to collapse from the inside out. Instead, one thought went red: Dad.

I found my feet running alongside the further wall, keeping my eyes fixed through the plaster. Utterly convinced the further I got that the thing had come silently through the backdoor beside the window behind me, and was gaining at my heels.

I found hardwood. I pushed off the countertop with my hands to throw myself faster, and finally made it into the living room. There was dad on the couch, slumped back how he told me not to with his book. He didn't look up from it as I ran up to him. Unphased until I leapt from the floor up into the cushions beside him. I grabbed him, and spoke out in the calmest voice I could manage despite my propulsive fear. I needed him to believe me, “There's a monster in the backyard and it looked at me. It was glad, daddy.” As I spoke, I looked back into the dining room. It seemed quiet. When I finished, I looked back to him. He was concerned but serious. I checked the dining room again and focused on the corner that turned into the playroom, concealed by a wall. I knew it could've been standing by the furnace.

I felt my dad's head turn up above the doorway and sigh, “Alright, baby.” He curled his page up over to drop the book by my side, and wrapped his arms around me. He stood up from the couch and walked with me into the dining room.

I held on tightly around his neck and looked back over my shoulder, worriedly watching the playroom come back into view. Waiting to see the furnace. Expecting to see tall white waiting behind it.

It occured to me that if it lept out—because my dad was carrying me in against his stomach—it could get me before he could pull back. It wouldn't even have to grab me. It'd just have to use its fingers.

There was the window, black. There was the furnace, black. The whole playroom, empty. The door to my room was ajar on the far wall; I often left it that way.

He carried me in through the door and laid me to bed, pulling the sheets up over me. I looked up at him and pleaded, “Dad… It was real. It was staring through the window, and it wanted something from me. It was leaning against the house. It wanted in and I don't know why it didn't come.” He sighed again, almost out of obligation. Reached forward and fiddled with the hair in my face. “It's okay,” he said softly to me. “You saw something like a log, or a spiderweb.” What did either of those things have to do with each other? “Monsters aren't real. 'Night, baby.”

He stood up, and I looked wide into his eyes. I noticed guilt in his face. But he just leaned back toward the door, letting his feet catch up until he found it with his hands. He turned back and said something, “Love you bunches.” Then the door squeaked open, light fell in; and it squeaked closed behind him. The light sealed away. Immediately I reached out and felt for the switch. My nightlight flicked on, battling a pitiful war against total void.

I looked down below my feet at the dark window by my bed, which revealed only my reflection. I saw myself in my little clothes and socks. That must have been how I looked to the monster, I thought, if it was staring through there. How hard was glass to break? I tucked my feet into rolls inside my blankets, which pulled the covers back from my neck quite a bit. But I knew that if I didn't protect them, then it could just grab my ankles.

I felt a shift in the room and stopped breathing. I kept my face as still as I could. I blinked out of habit, then caught myself. Several seconds went by, and nothing. I'd blinked and nothing had happened. I knew now that it couldn't see my blinks. Maybe it couldn't see my eyes at all? I decided that I could moisten them freely, and turned them in my still face. The nightlight cast shallow warmth over the surfaces which faced me. There was nothing standing in its beam that didn't belong there, except my new homework on the desk. Still, maybe it was standing in the skinny shadows that lined the walls.

I heard fabric sharply pricked. Something poked the small of my back. The tips of my lungs caught in my throat, and my eyes swelled at once. The jab went back down, and I realized that I felt it through the mattress. Something long had reached up from under.

I laid still; completely tense. My covers were sweltering hot. I felt sweat running down my blanketed arms. My heart ripped in my chest. I needed dad. If I called him, the monster would hear. But I needed him. It would hear my yell and get me. I knew it already knew where I was, and it could grab me anytime. “DADDY, RUN!! IT'S HERE!!”

I didn't stop screaming, but I lost all sense of what I was saying. It's like I floated outside my body, and my words weren't the most important thing anymore. The screams might get my dad faster, so my voice kept calling out. But there were more significant things. Like how it didn't poke me again. How it didn't say anything. How it didn't crawl out, or reach up to pull me under. Or run away.

My dad's footsteps trampled down the carpet in the playroom outside, and I heard them slow before the door. The knob turned—not too quickly but more than usual—and swung open wide as he leaned in. His expression was of pity.

I was curled up in bed, hugging myself and pulling the covers tight like armour. I told him something like that he should hurry. Then words started to feel important again, and so I said nothing. He knew best.

He slowly walked in, up to my bed, and kneeled down beside me with his arm on my shoulder. He was out of breath from running to me, but he tried his best to keep a calm tone, “What's wrong?” I told him. He just pressed his lips together and kept a fixed gaze on my eyes. He didn't sigh. That's how I knew he was going to help.

“It's under the bed?” he asked. I nodded back. He nodded as well to reassure me. He patted my shoulder twice for good luck, before sliding his knee across the carpet. His hand stayed on my shoulder. That's how I knew it couldn't pull him under as he ducked down. I knew he was safe. That meant I was safe with him.

He ducked down out of view, beneath the bed. I waited, sensing the way he held my shoulder. He felt safe. I knew the monster had been under there; but if it was still, then he'd be seeing it now. Even without him saying, it was obvious he didn’t see anything. That either meant only I could see it, or it had left. I glanced back down through the window below my feet, but still: There was only the reflection of my own gaze, and the edge of my bed.

My dad's hand on my shoulder shifted a bit as he started to lift himself back up. I scanned his face as he surfaced over the edge and looked back at me. He was smiling, wide. His lips curled high, up between his ears and his nose. He had a strong glint in his eyes from my nightlight, and I slowly realized it was because his eyes had swelled. Or maybe they'd just opened more. “Nothing's down there,” he said warmly to me.

An overwhelming frozen sensation ran up my entire body. I felt tears welling up. I clenched my jaw tight. He sighed in a different tone from before, admiring my silliness. He placed his hand on one knee and took the effort of standing up high above me. He looked down into my eyes. I could see up into his widening nostrils. “I'm gonna go talk to your mom, alright?” I thought about what to say, but I knew certainly in my heart that I would die if I said anything. I didn’t know how to make sense of any of this.

He lifted his fist to his wide lips—acting like he was covering them—to clear his throat. Then he turned to the door, and left again. Without the guilt. I watched the door carefully as the light from the playroom outside was tightly shut out, and an oppressive loneliness became loud to me. I felt something chilly poking my belly. Frozen breath fell onto my face.

Somewhere in my house—I think it's under a magnet, on the fridge—there's a picture of us smiling. The four of us.
