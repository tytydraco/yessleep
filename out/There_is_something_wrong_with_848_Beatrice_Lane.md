I will start with this.  

I am not insane and I enjoy solitude. 

So none of this is just me scaring myself because I’m alone in a big house on an even bigger property.

At least not anymore. 

Some of the names of people and roads have been changed because I’m not trying to draw any attention to my exact location or who is around me. I’m 17 and I have been living at a farm in the Bay Area for about two weeks now. I've stayed here many times before but never alone. Well, I’m not alone but the other two people in the house are an 85-year-old woman with extremely advanced dementia (she once introduced herself, we talked, walked out of the kitchen and then back in, was gone for about 5 seconds and then reintroduced herself and had the exact same conversation 5 times) and a caregiver who changes depending on what day of the week it is. They stay on the second floor and I stay on the first. There are doors upstairs and downstairs but I recently discovered the downstairs door does not lock, in fact every time I've stayed here previously it as always been left open to let the two wiener dogs Sadie and Coco outside onto the pool deck and the grass to let them use the bathroom when they wish. 

 The plan is for me to be in California house-sitting for about a month and a half while my trainer was out of the country. I would be taking care of the five horses and two dogs. The first week I was alone went great, I was in *heaven* living ‘alone’. Margret arrived 6 days after I did. Margaret lived in the house with our trainer but she had been at home visiting her parents for a while then she came back to repack her bags and join our trainer out of the country while I stayed to mind the property. 

Anyways I have not been sleeping well for the past few days. I haven’t gotten a good night's sleep since my friend, we'll call her Margret, left. She normally lives here with our trainer but both of them are out of the country now. But I keep feeling like I’m not alone downstairs. But the only people who go downstairs are Margret and the groundskeeper Elena (fake name), Elena is never at the farm after 5 pm and I dropped Margret off at the airport 5 days ago. No one else goes downstairs. 

The second night after Margret left was when it started. I blamed my paranoia on the creepy stories I’d been listening to that day and the fact I couldn’t sleep on my insomnia. But now I know it's not just in my head. I started locking my bedroom door at night despite the dogs sleeping with me, I would just wake up and let them out. I also started sleeping with the shutters closed and all but one window locked ( I wanted to let in fresh air and it was the only one with a screen so it felt safe enough).  The third night after Margret left I started sleeping with my belt knife under my pillow.

The fourth day I was sitting on my bed working on a project after coming down from the barn. I was sitting on my bed after the class I taught (I only taught on Saturdays) and not studying for the SAT. From my bed, I had a direct line of sight into the room's walk-in closet (yeah I know really bad Feng Shui). The closet doesn’t have a door so I can look inside from my bed. Inside the closet is another door on the back side and in all the times I’d stayed there I’d never snooped in the closet or tried the door (another rider used to live in the room and a lot of her stuff is still in there) but that morning the inner closet door was ajar letting a sliver of light in.

 I got up and tried pulling the door shut. It moved but didn’t click shut and instead swung back open about a half an inch. I tried again, same result. I opened the door just enough to be able to check the frame and make sure nothing was in the way. When I was sure it was clear I pulled the door shut again and tried turning the handle to make sure it clicked but to no avail, the door wouldn’t latch. I sighed and figured maybe the door was just *like that?* And I somehow hadn’t noticed till now for some reason. But I decided to text Margaret and ask her about the door. I didn't expect an answer until far later in the day thanks to time zones. 

That night I was up doing night check at the far paddock. There was only one horse in it, a retired old mare named Diva. I was checking the gates to make sure everything was secure and after I finished checking Diva’s paddock I would be done. But as I walked around checking I noticed the haybarn door was open, I figured I must have forgotten to shut it after afternoon feed and walked over to shut the door. It was right next to Diva’s paddock and while I was closing the door I smelled this putrid oder, like the smell of a piece of meat that got left in the middle of the road in the dead of summer for a week. 

I almost retched from the smell. It was so horrible, which was surprising because, in all my time working with horses, I had smelled and seen some pretty disgusting things that would make most city folk hurl their guts out, you’d be surprised how dead a living thing can smell. But this was like something dead 10 times over, I have quite literally never smelt something so horrible. 

Once my sudden onset nausea passed I looked up past the barn and at the private road we were on, Beatrise Lane. It was a bit worse for wear but it did its job and standing dead center of it staring at me was a coyote. There had been a problem with a coyote a few months back but I hadn't heard anything recently. But there in the middle of Beatrise Lane there it was. It stared at me with the most intelligent eyes I’ve ever seen on an animal. Its gaze unnerved me and before it could get to me too bad Coco the 33-pound wiener dog mutt who would try to fight anything alive even God if she could came tearing towards it barking up a storm. The coyote turned and ran and that was when I noticed Diva was in the far corner of her paddock away from the thing. Diva was never scared of anything and was more likely to kill a dog or a coyote than run from it.

 I called Coco back, I was very unsettled by everything going on and started heading down the hill. I called for Sadie, the 8-month-old wiener puppy who had a habit of wandering off. I stopped walking to stand and listen for the jingle of her collar. But as I stood there I could swear I heard Margret's voice call Sadie’s name. My skin crawled and I was pretty sure I was losing it. Sadie exited Cheval’s paddock (yes he’s a horse named Horse) and I jogged the whole way back down the hill to the house and I slammed the door shut behind me.

I slid down the door unsure if I was losing my mind or not. Sadie climbed onto my lap and Coco went off in search of food, I sat there and rubbed my face for a while before eventually moving back to my bedroom downstairs. I closed the door and sat down at my desk to work a bit and try to relax. Coco and Sadie were curled up on my bed and about an hour later I was getting ready for bed when Coco stood up on the bed and started barking, at the closet.

 This immediately set off every alarm bell in my mind. I went to my pillow and found my belt knife was gone. Like I moved my pillow and it wasn’t there. I knew at that moment I couldn’t sleep in there. I bolted up the stairs and planned to find a couch in the unused south wing of the house that no one ever went in. I opened the kitchen door at the top of the stairs and in the corner of my eye, I saw movement. I almost screamed but I realized it was just Erin the weekend caregiver.

 I tried to get my heart to stop beating so fast as she told me she was actually about to go looking for me. She asked me if I would go out with her to her car to get a blanket, she didn’t know why but she didn’t want to go outside alone in the dark. I obliged and asked her if she would help me with a dumb task and help me check my closet. I explained how Coco reacted to the closet (I left out the thing about the knife, I thought I was being jumpy and paranoid and didn’t want to admit I was being as dumb as sleeping with a knife over nothing) as we walked to her car. When we got to her car she started getting her blanket and I kept an eye on the darkness watching for any sign of the intelligent yellow eyes. We both hurried back inside and she set down her blanket before we headed downstairs together. 

I went to grab my flashlight but Erin pushed the door open with zero hesitation. I paused and then followed her inside. The closet was empty except for some old suitcases and paintings, but other than that it was empty. There was some dust on the paintings but other than that it was empty. I apologized for wasting her time and she said it was fine and headed upstairs, my gaze lingered on the large window in the closet. I thought it was an odd thing to have in a closet. I still felt uneasy but now I felt stupid too. 

That takes us to last night. Yesterday had been fairly calm and I actually thought maybe everything had passed, I had been out in the pool at dusk (it was far too hot to be out in the sun midday I would burn so fast on the pool deck) when heard Margret's voice, I couldn’t pinpoint where it came from but I instantly knew I was done swimming. I was at the far side of the pool near the woods and the cliff, I needed to get in the house but if I wanted to get out instead of crossing the pool I’d have to go closer to the woods, I noped out of that and quickly swam to the other side of the pool towards the door. As I grabbed my towel and headed inside the putrid scent from the night before returned. I closed the sliding door and wished the door could lock.

After I got out of the shower I tried to not look at the glass door as I passed it. It was dark now and figured I hadn’t been asked to do night check so I didn’t *need* to go out and decided to just go to bed early. I locked my bedroom door, checked the closet, and climbed into bed. The knife was still missing and that made me nervous but I fell into a nervous sleep. I woke up a few hours later, when my mind reconnected with my body and I found my gaze settled on the closet. 

Everything in my body felt wrong and I knew the closet was the source. I was done with this house and decided I was going to go stay in the living quarters of the horse trailer. I quickly went up the stairs and opened the kitchen door but came to a screeching halt when I saw a lanky figure in the window. I felt a scream in my throat but caught it when I realized it was Victoria (fake name for privacy) the old lady dementia. 

I calmed my breathing and stepped into the grand dining room, she was standing looking out the wall of windows overlooking the valley. I asked her what she was doing up and she turned to look at me, her eyes were the clearest I’ve ever seen them before. She spoke to me and said 

“Its back. Its not safe outside.” her voice was clear and she the most lucid she’d ever been with me. She looked at one of the many paintings covering the house, there were hundreds and they were all painted by her deceased husband “They got him, the shadows.” with that cryptic message she suddenly left heading back to her room. No one ever talked about Mr. Hawthorne or how he died. Thoroughly discouraged about going outside or staying in any other part of the empty house I headed back downstairs. I just wanted to go back to bed and ignore everything that was happening. I turned on a video essay playlist on my phone, turned up the volume, and fell asleep. 



I woke up about an hour later, I saw Margret had *finally* answered my text. I read it and my blood ran cold.

*‘Haley's closet?’*

*‘No one has been able to open that closet in years.’*

My theory of Margaret being the reason the closet was open was thrown out the window. I watched the door intently. I was too scared to get up and turn on the light. My room smelled of rotten flesh and I saw intelligent yellow eyes peaking in the slats of the blinds. 

I gathered up the courage and bolted from my bed for the door, I heard the closet door swing open behind me as I ran out of my room. I took the stairs two at a time as I flew upstairs and slammed the stair door shut. I had left my phone down stairs so I sat on the kitchen floor out of view of any of the windows with a kitchen knife until I saw daylight leak into the house. 



I grabbed my phone and laptop and hurried back upstairs to the kitchen. I’m now writing this and everything seems fine but I now know there is something is *very wrong with 848 Beatrise Lane.* My trainer and Margaret won’t be back for another 2 weeks and I don’t know what to do. If anyone knows what this thing might be or what to do please share, I feel trapped and don’t know if I will make it through another night here.
