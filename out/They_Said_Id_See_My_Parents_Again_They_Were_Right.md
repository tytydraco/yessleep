The train station was nearly empty, the platform slick with morning dew and the faint scent of rusted metal. I stood alone beneath the overcast sky, the letter trembling slightly in my hand as I read it again—though I had already memorized every word.

> *Dear Grandson,*

> *Good news! The townsfolk found your parents! Return home quickly!*

> *Sincerely,* 

> *Illie*

The handwriting was unmistakable—sharp, deliberate strokes that hadn’t changed in decades. I folded the paper carefully and tucked it into my coat pocket, my heart pounding with a strange mix of hope and dread. After nearly twenty years of silence—of believing my parents had vanished without a trace—they had been found?

The thought seemed impossible. And yet, there I was, boarding a train bound for Straja, the last city before the mountains swallowed the land.

The journey took twelve hours, winding through valleys and forests that grew denser and darker the farther the train traveled. I stared out the window, watching the landscape shift from familiar to forgotten, my reflection flickering in the glass like a ghost. That night, I stayed in a modest inn on the edge of Straja, sleep eluding me.

At dawn, I unfolded the brittle, hand-drawn map Illie had given me years ago—one I had tried to follow before, always without success. The ink had faded, the paper creased and worn, but the path was still there: a narrow trail leading into the forest, marked only by memory and moss.

With the map in hand, I left the edge of Straja behind and stepped onto the trail. It was barely marked—more suggestion than road—winding between tall pines and beech trees whose trunks leaned in like silent sentinels. The morning light filtered through the canopy in pale shafts, catching on the mist that clung low to the ground. Each step felt heavier than the last. The air grew cooler, damp with the scent of moss and stone, and the sounds of the city faded behind me like a dream.

The trail began to climb—slowly at first, then more steeply as the forest thickened. Roots twisted across the path like veins, slick with moisture, and the underbrush grew dense and dark. I paused often—not to rest, but to listen. There were no birds, no wind, only the soft crunch of my boots and the occasional drip of water from the leaves. The trees here were ancient, their bark furred with lichen, their branches heavy with silence. I passed a crumbling stone marker, half-swallowed by ivy, etched with symbols I didn’t recognize—but felt I should. The mist thickened as I climbed, curling around my legs and shoulders. Time seemed to stretch. I could no longer tell how long I had been walking.

And then, just as the trail seemed to vanish into the undergrowth, the forest opened. The trees parted like curtains, revealing a hollow nestled in the mountainside. There, shrouded in fog and shadow, stood the village of Lunca. Stone cottages with moss-covered roofs clustered around a narrow square, their windows dark and still. Smoke curled lazily from a few chimneys, though I heard no voices, no movement.

It was exactly as I remembered—unchanged, untouched, as if preserved in amber. I stood at the edge of the clearing, breath caught in my throat, heart pounding.

Whether by luck or fate, I had found my way home.

I stepped into the village like I was walking into a dream.

The mist curled around my legs as I crossed the square, muffling the sound of my footsteps. The cottages stood in quiet formation, their stone walls slick with moisture, roofs sagging beneath thick layers of moss. Wooden shutters hung slightly askew, and the windows reflected only gray sky. Smoke drifted from a few chimneys, but the air was still—too still.

Then a voice broke the silence.

"Welcome back," said Ionel, standing outside the butcher’s shop, cleaver in hand. He looked exactly as I remembered—broad-shouldered, apron stained, face unchanged by time. Not a wrinkle more. Not a hair out of place.

Others appeared as I moved through the square. Mircea, the farmer, hauling a sack of grain with the same slow rhythm. The Dragan family, herding goats across the cobblestones, the children waving shyly. Every face was familiar. Every gesture preserved.

They greeted me warmly, kindly. But none of them said my name.

I tried to ask about my parents, about the letter, but the answers were always the same—gentle, vague, and evasive.

"They’re being looked after," someone said.  

"You’ll see them soon," said another.

No one offered more than that. After a while, I stopped asking.

With nothing else to do, I made my way toward my grandfather’s house.

The path was overgrown but unmistakable. The leaning pine still stood watch over the roof. The door creaked open before I could knock.

Illie stood in the doorway, thinner than I remembered, but his eyes were sharp, his smile tight.

"You made it," he said, pulling me into a brief, firm hug. "I wasn’t sure you would."

Inside, the house was preserved like a memory. Dustless. Still. My childhood room waited for me, untouched—same desk, same faded quilt, same faint scent of pine and old paper. It was as if I had never left.

At lunch, Illie served a thick, moss-colored stew. I hesitated, then took a bite. The taste was earthy, familiar, strangely comforting. He watched me eat, saying little.

When I asked about my parents, Illie’s gaze drifted to the window.

"They’re with Sorina," he said. "The healer. She’s been taking care of them. You’ll see them soon."

That night, the village was silent.

I wandered the narrow paths, past shuttered windows and flickering lanterns. The mist had thickened, and the air was heavy with the scent of damp wood and something else—something sweet and earthy.

I paused at the old well in the square. A memory surfaced: my mother’s voice, warning me not to look too deep. "Things live in the dark," she had whispered once, her hand tight around mine.

Back in my room, I lay awake, listening. The silence pressed in from all sides. No crickets. No wind. Just the slow, rhythmic creak of the house settling into the earth.

And then, just before sleep took me, I heard it—a faint rustling beneath the floorboards, like roots shifting in the soil.

I must have drifted off, because the next thing I remember was the feeling of damp earth pressing against my skin.

In the dream, I was lying beneath the forest floor. Not buried—just beneath, as if the soil had grown around me. I could see the roots above me, tangled and pulsing faintly with light, like veins beneath translucent skin. They moved slowly, rhythmically, as though breathing. I wasn’t afraid. I wasn’t anything. I felt calm. Still. Whole.

Somewhere in the distance, I heard voices—not speaking, exactly, but murmuring in a language I didn’t know and somehow understood. They weren’t calling to me. They were remembering me.

I reached up, and the roots reached down.

When I woke, my hands were clenched around the bedsheets, damp with sweat. The morning light was pale and cold, filtering through the curtains like mist. I sat up slowly, heart pounding, the dream still clinging to me like fog.

The rustling was gone. But the silence remained.

Over the next few days, I wandered the village, trying to shake the feeling that something was watching me. The stillness that had once felt peaceful now unsettled me. The villagers moved with the same quiet rhythm, their smiles unchanged, their eyes just a little too distant.

I asked again about my parents. Illie deflected, as always.

"They’re resting," he said, not meeting my eyes. "You’ll see them soon."

His tone was gentle, but final. Like a door quietly closing.

I stopped asking.

But the silence only made the questions louder. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was being kept from me.

A few nights later, over dinner, Illie mentioned it casually, as if it were nothing.

"I’ll be out late tonight," he said, ladling another spoonful of stew into my bowl. "Sorina’s been tending the garden by moonlight. Says the moss grows better that way."

I nodded, pretending not to care. But something in his voice—too light, too rehearsed—stuck with me.

That night, I waited until the house was quiet. I watched from the upstairs window as Illie stepped into the mist, lantern in hand, and made his way down the path toward the edge of the village. I counted to fifty, then followed.

The air was colder than before, the mist thicker. My footsteps were nearly silent on the moss-covered ground. I kept my distance, ducking behind trees and fences, heart pounding with every step.

At the far end of Lunca, Illie reached Sorina’s house and opened the door like it belonged to him. No hesitation. No knock. Just the soft creak of old hinges as he stepped inside and quietly shut it behind him.

I crouched low behind a thicket of ferns across the path, breath held. The mist had thickened here, curling around the garden like a veil. The house stood in stillness—no candlelight in the windows, no voices, no movement. Just silence.

I waited.

A minute passed. Then another.

No footsteps. No conversation. Not even the sound of Illie moving inside. It was as if the house had swallowed him whole.

Right beside the house was an unfenced garden, wild and overgrown. The mist hung low over the ground, curling around the edges of moss-covered stones and pale, flowering fungi that glowed faintly in the moonlight.

At first, I thought they were statues.

Two figures stood near the center of the garden, side by side, motionless. They were tall, human-shaped, and dressed in clothing that looked oddly familiar. I squinted through the haze, trying to make sense of what I was seeing.

The coat—dark wool, frayed at the cuffs. The shawl—white, with a faded red floral pattern. My eyes widened. I knew those clothes. I hadn’t seen them in decades, but I remembered them clearly. My father’s coat. My mother’s shawl.

I stepped closer, heart thudding.

The figures were too still. Their posture too perfect—shoulders gently sloped, hands folded just so. Like they had been arranged. Preserved.

Then I saw their skin.

It was smooth. Too smooth. Not like flesh, but something else—something grown. The texture looked soft and pale, almost waxy, with faint green veins running just beneath the surface. My stomach turned.

And their faces—

Their faces were incomplete.

Where their eyes should have been, there were only dark recesses—at first glance, they looked hollow, like empty sockets carved into smooth, pale skin. But as I leaned in, I saw movement.

Not emptiness. Growth.

Moss filled the voids—thick and dark, threaded with delicate filaments that shimmered faintly in the moonlight. It wasn’t just growing there—it was nesting, layered and dense, like something cultivated. Tiny tendrils curled outward from the sockets, twitching slightly, as if tasting the air.

Then, as I stared, the moss shifted.

Not with the breeze—there was none—but with intention. The filaments stirred, recoiled, then slowly unfurled again. It was as though the moss itself was aware of me, watching me without eyes.

I stumbled back, a gasp caught in my throat. My foot snapped a twig.

A light flickered in the window.

Illie appeared behind the glass, his face half-lit by a lantern. He didn’t look surprised. He didn’t look angry.

He just looked at me.

Right into me.

I ran.

Branches clawed at my coat as I tore through the mist, back toward the house. My thoughts were a blur—memories, questions, panic. I didn’t stop until I reached the front door, slammed it shut behind me, and leaned against it, chest heaving.

I had to leave. Now.

I grabbed my bag from the bedroom, shoved in what little I had brought, and turned to go. My hand was on the doorknob when I heard it—footsteps on the porch.

I opened the door.

They were waiting.

Dorin and Anca. My parents.

Standing in the pale light, smiling.

Their faces were complete now. The mossy hollows had been filled—eyes that looked almost human, but not quite. Too still. Too green.

Illie stood behind them, his expression unreadable.

"We’ve missed you," my parents said, in perfect unison.

"You’re almost ready."

I slammed the door shut.

My parents’ voices still echoed in my ears—soft, synchronized, wrong. I backed away from the threshold, heart pounding, the image of their too-still eyes seared into my mind.

Illie hadn’t said a word. He didn’t need to.

I bolted the door and stumbled down the hallway, pacing in tight, frantic circles. I had to leave. I had to get out of Lunca before whatever had taken them came for me too.

This time, I didn’t hesitate. I grabbed my bag—no second-guessing, no looking back. I didn’t even bother with the map. I knew the trail. I walked it just days ago.

Before slipping out the back door, I snatched a kitchen knife. Just in case.

The village was quiet—but not empty. I could feel it. Eyes in the mist. Shapes that didn’t move quite right.

I reached the edge of the square, heart hammering, only to stop cold. They were all there. Everyone. Blocking the path. Everyone except the ones pretending to be my parents—and Illie.

Footsteps echoed behind me.

I turned.

They were coming.

I pulled out the knife and held it steady, warning them to stay back. But no one flinched. Anca, Dorin, and Illie stopped just a few feet in front of me.

"Don’t leave," Anca said softly. "Come. Stay with us. You’ll be one of us soon."

"What do you mean?" I asked, my voice trembling.

"You’ll find out soon enough," Dorin replied, his tone calm—too calm.

"I don’t want to!" I shouted. "I just want to leave. Don’t try to stop me! Or… or I’ll hurt you!"

"There’s no need for violence," Anca said gently. "Come, give your mother a hug. Everything will be okay."

She stepped forward, arms outstretched, as if to embrace me. I raised the knife and slashed her hand. Her thumb fell to the ground.

She didn’t react. Her expression didn’t change. That same cold smile remained frozen on her face. Where her thumb had been, there was no blood—only moss, dense and dark, growing from within.

Behind me, the crowd shifted. An opening had formed.

"You may leave," Anca said. "You’re not ready yet. But soon… you will be."

I backed away slowly, eyes darting between the figures. Their gazes never left me. When I was far enough, I turned and ran—straight into the misty trail I knew so well, not daring to look back.

The mist swallowed me whole.

Branches clawed at my arms as I tore through the underbrush, the trail barely visible beneath the shifting fog. My lungs burned, but I didn’t stop. I couldn’t. Behind me, the silence of Lunca pressed in like a weight, unnatural and absolute.

I didn’t dare look back.

The forest thickened, the trees older here—twisted, gnarled, watching. I knew this path. I had walked it just days ago. Now every step felt unfamiliar, foreign.

The knife trembled in my grip.

Hours passed—or maybe minutes. Time had lost all meaning. But then, through the thinning mist, I saw it: a wooden signpost, half-rotted and leaning, pointing toward Straja. Relief surged through me—sharp, overwhelming.

I was close.

The trees began to thin, the air lightening with every step. I stumbled out of the forest and onto a gravel road. In the distance, lights flickered—warm, steady, human. Real.

Straja.

I collapsed to my knees, gasping for breath, the knife still clenched in my hand. I was out. I had made it.

I dropped the blade and forced myself to my feet, heading straight for the inn I had stayed at before. The staff looked up in alarm as I entered—my clothes torn, my skin scratched and streaked with moss and dirt.

"What happened to you?" one of them asked, eyes wide.

"Hiking accident," I said quickly. "I just need to rest."

They didn’t press further. A room was prepared, and I was left alone.

The room was quiet, but sleep didn’t come easily.

Even with the door locked and the curtains drawn, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had followed me. Not in the literal sense—there were no footsteps, no shadows at the window. Just a presence. A weight. As if the forest hadn’t let me go completely.

I lay still for hours, staring at the ceiling, listening to the hum of the radiator and the occasional creak of the old inn settling. When I finally drifted off, my dreams were thick and slow. I wandered through endless woods, the ground soft beneath my feet, the air damp and sweet. I could feel something pulsing beneath the soil, like breath.

I woke with dirt under my nails.

The days passed in a blur. I stayed inside mostly, claiming exhaustion. The innkeeper brought me food, asked polite questions I barely answered. I told myself I was recovering. That I just needed time.

But I found myself drawn to the darker corners of the city. The shaded alley behind the bakery. The mossy stone wall near the church. I lingered there longer than I meant to, breathing in the damp, earthy air.

I stopped answering calls. The voices on the other end felt distant, like echoes from a life I’d already left behind.

On the fifth day, I packed my bag.

At the train station, the sky was overcast, the platform nearly empty. I stood alone, watching the tracks disappear into the trees. The wind stirred the leaves, and for a moment, I thought I heard something—soft, like movement beneath the ground.

Then, a whisper. Faint. Familiar.

*Come home.*

I closed my eyes. My fingers curled into fists.

*Come home.*

The train’s horn cut through the air. I stepped forward.

"No," I said under my breath. "Not this time."

The doors opened. I boarded without looking back.

As the train pulled away, the forest receded into mist. I sat by the window, watching the trees blur into shadow, the sound still faint in the back of my mind.

But I kept going.
