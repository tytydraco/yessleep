You can’t exactly call something an open secret when it’s paraded outright on propaganda newsfeeds and magazine subscriptions. Not that I know of anyone who actually read those, or even bother with print media anymore, but clearly someone real high up the chain of command knows of the Midnight Matrep. 

Not that he’s trying that hard to stay hidden when he’s had appeared in two well known movies about ah boys training here. I’ve been reassigned from a combat unit to help out the logistics team fuelling the island’s security unit and almost every single evening he shows up at the ferry jerry come crack of amber. Just another face in the trundling crowd of miserable recruits heading to their bunk. 

Always the same results when he flicks us that preppy smile and slides over his camp pass. Nobody on current rotation knew who authorised that particular pass, which looked to be a piece of faded plastic handed out since the early army daze of the island. So it’s probably by some conscript who had left service long ago.

But each time it clears the system and we get explicit permission from the regulars to let him in. One of the boys tried looking him up via the defence database and it shows nothing more than a blank page with a singular line of nonsense wherever it usually shows essential information. 

None of us particularly cared enough to find out being that we’re all just conscripts doing time. And anyone important enough to try didn’t give any orders, just shrugged the anomaly off. Logic given that if he wanted to do something he’d have done so long ago. The Midnight Mat was as a feature of this island since the start of their careers, as prominent as its legendarily shit weather, monkeys and forgotten ruins. 

You’ll see the Mat for the rest of the evening hanging around the canteens beside the medbay. Joyfully mingling with all the lao jiao regulars like they were long time kakis, sharing talks about the state of the world in between sips of coffee while CNA plays from TVs mounted up the background. Everyone who had been here as a serviceman knew the guy. Wasn’t even any sort of phenomenon either, the Midnight Matrep was just the friendly sort who loved talking to folk of all creeds. 

He talked to the cleaners and cookhouse staff who’d came all the way from Malaysia to work like a slave for Singaporean masters. He talked the same no matter the end of the foreign spectrum: be they Bangla workers or Chinese dignitaries. No matter the smell, class or status they were all just good conversation. I could respect that.

Sometimes people would appear out of nowhere and ask for directions to the Mat. Always afternoon but before nightfall in the perfect twilight between times. Hearsay spread on from an ancient game of telephone says that one must never deceive them. Just be honest about his whereabouts. Sometimes, more hearsay probably, people took mental note of a strange lady clad in jewellery looking for him. Other times suited gentlemen speaking in distant tongues we had no name for would show up with wrapped gifts.

No idea what they were doing. Friend of mine saw the Mat getting a blowie under a table once. Another guy piqued up and said they saw the Mat smoking cigars with a suited gentleman dressed out of some “princess’s ball.” A third brought up mention of a few soldiers in strange uniforms frisking the Mat but running away as soon as the amber falls.

Hearsay? Folk cooped up in the island during confinement week would get handsy with the Matrep’s friends, probably try to take expensive stuff that wasn’t theirs.

They’d disappear. Would’ve never believed the stories until- Oh? It’s not because of the air of unease around the Midnight Mat, but because I can’t believe people get this precarious to a guest on our island. 

Until we had to remove a burnt mattress and scrape kilograms of salt off the floors. The supply line’s commander didn’t say anything beyond the ordinary when signing the paperwork that allowed the provost to settle the investigation. Got called in when they were done with the actual work. That was an hour wasted that they no doubt didn’t want to be stuck doing.

Least I managed to salvage some new kit.

Occasionally? Strange men and women who smelled of foreign pines and rusty waters would appear out of thin air all disoriented like newborns. Tourists are a recent phenomenon that only happened after the changeling event a few years ago. 

First batch of specs who found em created a big hoohah when an anti terror task force got called to handle investigations. Whole security team, from the commanding level all the way down to the support personnel got fucked left right centre for letting in common illegals despite the millions of dollars of brand new security measures. Was performing a pushup over a mud pool in filthy admin clothes and facing the rest of my scuttled career in a political prison when a man in white polo stepped in to speak with security command. 

As if like nothing major? Everyone was sent back to their bunks and told to get ready for inspection. Inspection passed quickly, too quickly and we all got an early bookout on Thursday night. The men in white took over the week’s security detail so we knew we did nothing wrong. An anomalous issue, they clarified, not human error.

Had a good laugh over smuggled beers when we returned back from our extended holiday. The new rules were surprisingly easy to follow; just haul ‘em to the guardroom and let staffers from the Singaporean embassy handle things with nice tour packages to our great country’s sights. 

Had a tourist spawn this morning. Buncha cookhouse workers dialled my team in because a tourist had appeared inside the boiler rooms they called a kitchen. These were disgusting places, hot and fetid and covered to the brim with clattering industrial equipment that magically churned frozen food to barely edible chow for a tirade of forever hungry recruits. I was already sweating when me and my team entered the place.

Usually settled logistics but I had to do a full 24 hrs duty because the guy who was supposed to clock in today got called back to the mainland to handle things with police. Nothing secret squirrel, government just suspended him for drunk driving naked down the Causeway last Saturday night. Lmao even. Didn’t like putting on that all black kit reserved solely for anomalous events. Hated it even more when we stepped into the kitchen.

Heard a tourism screaming bloody murder in a tongue so ancient, so profane that I had to wince when following the noice through the kitchen. An easy search that lead me to her in about a minute. Memories get foggy over here, so thats why I’m writing this.

In front of me was this bespectacled ginger who had thrown off all her clothes til she was completely buck raving naked. Chest pressed against a gigantic cooker like it was a lifeline in a sight that would’ve been…titillating if not for the absolutely dismal state of frostbite she was in. 

So frosted over that the red had turned into the black of necrosis. Skin paled like a corpse’ pallor. Eyes red and bloodshot. Teeth had chattered so hard that the gums were starting to rend and bleed in ways I didn’t know possible. Looked like a ghoul in a really bad wig.

Hard to explain in a r/nosleep post. Especially since I was better at economics than at engineering, let alone biology. But all those factoid channels on my Youtube feed taught me that sometimes when people are faced with extreme cold their minds perform a complete 180. Something about feeling a nostalgic warmth via blood flushing into their brains makes them remove their clothes even in the middle of a snowstorm. 

Strange quirk of biology. But I like to think that it’s simply the brain’s way of mercy killing its host. Like that little voice in your head that says “Hey buddy, it’s cool now. You can let go.”

Keyword: Snowstorm. We were in the midst of one of Singapore’s hottest regions and this strange woman had just popped out of nowhere. Suffering from literal end stage frostbite and trapped in a boiler room that until the morning, had been locked. Just what the hell was going on? I was with the security team yes, but I mainly handled the back end of things. Never fieldwork.

But rules were still rules. My job as a commander was to handle business professionally and serviceably. Accountability Serviceability and Proficiently and all that jazz they indoctrinated us via brainal beams back in command school. So I told my guest to behave as if there was a lady in the room and call the medics over. 

“Ma’am. Do you understand me? I need you to stay still and be cooperative. You are in a restricted military facility and have to be processed. Resistance will be met by charges under a military tribunal.”

No response. Just more screaming in a language that sounded almost like english with the vowels all screwed up.

Along the way I noticed an orange parka that was streaked red with blood. Heavy hiking boots more rugged than mine and pants that looked to be insulated with multiple layers of leaking aerogels. You walk in the island with those and you’d drop dead in a minute. But they were slick with melting ice. Quaint huh? 

Medics had to drag the terrified woman out of the kitchen raving and screaming. She managed to swing a fist hard enough that it broke one of their anomalous kit’s masks. 

Moved to step in then. Been a while since I had to sprint out from the back of an armoured vehicle back in the 17th Dragoons, and all that bug-like kit I was wearing made me feel like a damned imperial stormtrooper in all the worst ways. Used to find the stuff cool. But now all I can associate with tacticool gear is just sweaty fatigue. Sprinted fast and ignored the squelched of something squeaky being crushed underfoot to restrain the raving tourist. The medics beside me cursing as brushed him aside to apply flexi-cuffs.

The tourism didn’t fight that hard against my gloves. I think all the resistance was gone when she made eye contact with the medic, then mine. Something ain’t right with her pupils.

Human. I recognise the word coming out of her strange tirade, but just barely. Stayed silent the whole way as we moved her into the medbay. 

We followed the rules. Followed protocol. Cleaned up right and told witnesses to keep their story consistent if someone asks. Nobody was hurt and after we cleaned up all the excess stuff we tossed em into a crate and headed back out.

Just another day. 

But gosh damned, I was hungry and it was getting late. The staffers were already finished with prepping dinner by the time my team was debriefed by the medics and security command. So I stripped off my kit, changed to admin gear and headed out to the sports field to meet the Midnight Mat. Got a few members with me for a snack party. 

There’s a sports field on the island flanked by a great stadium. An oval track used to conduct IPPT tests, sports games or self directed training in the day. There’s a scenic view hidden behind a layer of concertina bordered wire fences of our great Singaporean shoreline and clean waters. If they are the arteries that our great nation rely on, then the sprawling fleets of cargo ships are the vital cells. There are waterbreaks to prevent the track from being flooded, sprouting from them like flagpoles studded with rectangles are Security Masts meant to prevent any anomalous incursions. We control them from the security room.

Several fliers are taped via folded masking tape onto concrete walls. Same few rules written on them as the older fliers tacked onto pinboards already chock full of ancient notices that warn of head exhaustion. Lots of things in this island could kill you that didn’t involve ghosty nasties like heat exhaustion, dengue, tetanus, heat stroke, hailstorms, influenzas, leeches and brain eating amoeba from stillwater. Last week we had to get a helicopter over to Changi because an excused dust personnel keeled over from inhaling asbestos that leaked out of a storeroom. The week before we had to call the same helicopter for a couple of specialist trainees who keeled after a long night march via sheer heat alone. Don’t know the genius who made his guys march twenty over klicks in full body armour in the midst of a heatwave, but I hope he got charged.   

Island has a long history of tales like that. Since my father’s time there was this story of a recruit who was found disembowelled, his innards arranged neat and tidy on a ground sheet like it was final inspection. Commanders speak of ghostly apparitions approaching them upon the devil’s hour asking if their duties could be relieved. Those on a road march know when to hurry up their pace when they get a whiff of frangipani. Another common story was the sighting of ghost platoons still marching in formation; clad neat and spiffy in Edwardian era uniforms. 

Holy shit do those look sexy. Pulled straight out of Dishonoured.  

I’ve seen something like that before. The garish sighting of flags from my tradition marching through tracks that lead to forgotten town while on a ration run. Had to follow protocol, me and my driver immediately diverting our eyes and flooring it. My hands praying to GuanYin the whole time as we ignored the procession. Driving away until the sound of leatherbound drums faded to the background. We had jobs of our own and I do not want another commander breathing down my neck. Let alone a warrior sent by Duyi to retrieve the unrepentant.

Driver had stories of his own. A big man from the Philippines who’d swore up and down that he’d saw a familiar Manananggal soaring through the night. The air of this ancient island had its own way doing that to people. Could be the conspiracy nonsense. Could be bad fengshui. I didn’t ask.

But the field behind by the tracks was a known safezone. No Security Mast required. The guy I was substituting told me a story of a time where he was being chased by glowing lights that gave him glimpses into “higher dimensions”. Thought he was high on kpods by he swore up and down that it was “legit type shit. Not like acid liddat.” But it stopped as soon as he met the Midnight Mat and his ninja van at 0131 hrs. You could always see the timing from this towering light post flanked by floodlights that highlighted a gigantic OLED screen that showed tons of information. None less embolden than a 24hr clock.

The rules, flanked by many many pictures of influencers that had crossed the ferry terminal tk taste the Mat’s food are as follows:

1- Bring your own cutlery and box. The Midnight Mat is not responsible for providing basic utensils for the customer. 

2- Bring your own bag for your own litter. The Midnight Mat is not responsible for hygiene beyond his own radius. Any acts of littering will be flagged out to military RnD for review. 

3- Do not insult, harass or assault the Midnight Mat. No staring incident. No theft. Any acts of aggression to a civilian vendor will be responded to as such by island security. Vendor is entitled to self defence limited by legal law. 

There was something written here that wasn’t there when we went around to paste the fliers. It was “LIMITED BUT NOT ENFORCED.” Ominous- but so far they were reasonable. Not something to worry about beyond conversing with the randoms at the pasar malam. 

4- One order per person. Keep your order for yourself only. You are not to order on the behest of another. You are not a pack mule. Island CO empowers anyone to refuse unlawful order to buy on behalf of another. 

5- The field must be kept neatly trimmed. Grass must NOT exceed ten inches of height. If grass is overgrown you must alert island command for mowing. 

6- No animals must be in the field. Field must be tended by pest control specialist in order to prevent anything more intelligent than a siphonophore making a presence.

A weird one but I can understand why a vendor wouldn’t want cats and dogs prowling onto their business. The hell is a siphonophore though? Sounds like some sea shit. How’d you even gauge intelligence in a jellyfish? 

7- If field needs to be vacated for utmost emergency alert island security command. The guardroom will activate emergency siren and the field will be vacated by vendor. If not an emergency? Just ask politely and give reasoning.

8- ALL CUSTOMERS MUST VACATE THE FIELD FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE 0300 HRS. ENSURE VISIBILITY OF DIGITAL CLOCK AT ALL TIMES. THE MIDNIGHT MATREP WILL GIVE YOU A LAST WARNING AT THE FIVE MINUTE MARK. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH GUIDELINE WILL RESULT IN COURT MARTIAL OFFENCE. 

9- ALL CUSTOMERS MUST RETURN TO THE FIELD AT LEAST FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER 0415 HRS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH GUIDELINE WILL RESULT IN COURT MARTIAL OFFENCE. 

There it was again. The same phrasing and implicit threat that we’ll punish anyone for flouting regs with the same aplomb as the idiots who do shit like mess about safety rules. Lots of TikTok trends about sabotaging equipment for revenge against toxic coworker these days y’know? Honestly a little strange that they even had a rule for what I assumed was to be a simple smoke break, pondered me. But we had been explicitly told by every single guard commander to leave the field by 0245hrs as to not break official guidelines. 

“Eh u/Nuerax. Stare so hard for fuck? I thought we read it already?” One of my guys asked before pointing towards a trickling queue of military personnel already getting their fried delicacies. I could recognise by their uniform and equipment that they were from the people stuck with 24hr duties, or stay in personnel here for a quick snack. The tell tale smell of material meals filling my nostrils as I nodded and joined up with my guys.

—-

It was 1101hrs according to the clock when we reached the Midnight Matrep’s peripheral. Somehow an entire ninja van had materialised out of thin air, as they were known to do so - not very strange - and driven all the way across the hyper militarised island under watch by sensory thijimagicks without being noticed. Didn’t even leave marks on the lawn beyond where it had parked as if it had just appeared out of thin air.

Just like the tables and chairs that appeared from thin air. Humbly done so to accommodate each and every single one of us. Nobody asked questions and frankly I couldn’t have cared less about the phenomenon. 

The Matrep looked like anyone you’d encounter drinking in Bali Lane or working the pasar malam. A tall, lean malay man who wore a black t-shirt emblazoned with a faded print of whatever is vogue at the time. He wore loose, baggy pants with a checkerboard pattern that covered his Sketchers workshoes and a silver chain around his neck. A black ballcap rested on his head and below that was one of those plastic faceguards worn during the Covid period to prevent saliva from spilling onto the meals. Tattoos adorned his forearms, strange inscriptions that looked like Arabic yet felt older somehow. Arches curved in ways I could’ve never explained.  

Stranger yet was his honeyed gold pupils that contrasted all our dark pupils. Eyes that glinted so bright under the harsh floodlights that it felt as if they could see through our souls. That the golden tips of his hair weren’t frosted, but rather a strangely natural blonde. 

Looks like a male version of Rell. Y’know, from hit animation studio League of Legends? 

“Ah bang.” He called to me and motioned towards a laminated card full of delicacies quite standard around the army camps of Singapore. Y’know the usual: Cutlets, waffles, cutlet waffles, maggi noodles accessorised with cutlets. Pork chops and chicken chops and lamb chops. Fries with rice and everything else. Even had the same banger curry puffs only sold on range days and the mini hotdogs skewered on sticks from Old Chang Kee. 
Everything around the ninja van looked to be plucked from a normal canteen kitchen. For example you could see the air fryers, coolers, oiled woks on a field stove and what not. I couldn’t see a single price tag on the menu. Coming from Singapore where everything, and I mean literally everything has a price unless the state intervenes such an anomaly felt wrong. I couldn’t actually forgive most of the odd coming ons of the island as part of some messed up government project involving beaming thoughtwaves into our brains.

But priceless meals were a step too far into emphatic unknown. Part glitch in the matrix part rift in our country’s nature. 

“What do you want for tonight, boss?” *The Matrep asked again, voice changing over from burlesque apathy to patient concern as those honeyed eyes met mine. I felt the weight of timelessness past over me like the gaze of a man with all the time in the world. Yet I hurriedly came to a conclusion because the guy behind me tsked his displeasure out loud.

“Maggi cutlet with egg ah. But how I pay? You got PayLah?”

“No need. I damn efficient one.” The Matrep laughs before pouring some warm water over a sprinkled packet of maggi noodles on the wok. A top of the line airfryer clacking shut with a breaded cutlet thrown inside for defrosting. He was now beginning to stir fry it with occasional glances to the defrosting. 

“All I need is something intangible from you. Hmm.”

The Matrep shook the wok and sent seasoned noodles up an inch in the air before starting to twirl it about with all the care in the world. When people meant that he cooked food, he really really cooked food like performing the most important art in the world. Love and care went into every shake of that blessed wok, a creeping smile appearing on his face as he tossed it again and again like something satisfying was coming together. 

“You remember the rat you stepped on in the cookhouse? I want it.”

“Huh? Paiseh ah. But you say what fuck? You want cook me the rat?” I spat at him, eyes doing a double take as I wondered if it’s time to sic my authority on him. No commander likes being insulted in front of their men, let alone in friendly territory. 

“No need. I efficient one!” He says again while sprinkling another packet of seasoning into the wok. “That sensation of stepping on the rat will do.” 

I paused, then closed my eyes while coming to terms that the drying gristle of a dead living being was still stuck on my Altamas. Had tried my best to forget about it but like a bad shame it clung to the sole’s underside with tenacity.

It felt so wrong, so alien to give up something that had already happened like that. My arms were tingling with goosebumps now…

But on the other hand? The maggi noodles were starting to smell like a personal heaven.
