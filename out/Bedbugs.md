My girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years now. I’ve had a few relationships when I was younger, but I wouldn’t have considered any of those highschool and college flings serious, especially after having been with Cindy. 

I met Cindy for the first time at a local cider mill. I visit every year to stock up on donuts, jams, and honey as my own little tradition. It was during a tour of the beekeeper’s beehives where I first saw her among a group of friends; short cropped black hair and sunglasses that worked poorly to hide her bubbly personality. She wore a gorgeous red jewel necklace that matched her enveloping brown eyes. Her smile captured me the moment I caught a glimpse of it. She stood out like a bold and beautiful queen bee among the tour group as she watched the bees extract nectar from patches of lavender.

I moved closer and closer to her as the tour went on, ultimately wooing her the moment I spoke my first words to her. 

“If we had some birds around here we could really make this a party.”

Looking back, that was probably the stupidest pick-up line I could’ve used at that moment. Somehow she liked it, and even better than that, she liked me. We hit it off right from the start. Several dates later and I agreed to move in with her, which may have been an odd decision to most after only going on several dates. She was the one that proposed the idea. The chemistry between us was nothing I had ever felt before. I truly thought she was my soulmate.

Cindy’s apartment is small. Roughly 600 square feet of bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and living room. Vintage wooden furniture filled the space. I didn’t consider any of this when I moved all my stuff from my parents home into her place. Since she lived there first, I would’ve been fine if she told me to throw a few pieces of clashing IKEA  furniture and childhood knicknacks away, but she was surprisingly accepting of keeping it all.  

The night I moved in with Cindy was the first night I slept in her bed. The thought that lucked me to sleep as I laid next to her was ‘I’m so lucky to be with this woman’.

 I had awoken to the smell of bacon. Realizing Cindy was already up, I got out of bed and took off my pajamas to get changed. My wrist felt irritated as I was taking off my shirt.  I noticed an inch sized red spot on the side of my wrist. It was inflamed and itchy. 

When I was a child it wasn’t uncommon for my skin to break out in hives from stress. The breakouts decreased as I got older, and before I met Cindy, it had been over half a decade since hives appeared on my skin. I chalked it up to being stressed from moving and put on a long sleeve shirt for the day. As the nights went on the red spots continued to appear. It wasn’t a common breakout area like hives. It was singular spots at random around my body. It seemed like every time I woke up in that bed I’d gain a new irritated splotch of red on my body. I don’t know if it was making me depressed or something, but since they were showing up I was sleeping more often. It wasn’t uncommon for Cindy to wake me up from a nap and tell me to eat some snacks to energize myself.

I would have brought this up to Cindy but I think it would’ve made her go crazy. Once, earlier in our relationship when I hadn’t moved in yet, we were hanging out on the bed in her bedroom  just talking and listening to music. She began screaming. I had never heard anyone scream that loud before. I nearly fell off the bed trying to get away from whatever she was screaming at. Really manly of me, I know. I was yelling back at her in a panic asking what was happening. 

“It’s a bug!” She announced, recoiling away and pointing at the center of the bed.

I took a closer look. It was a stinkbug, fairly common where we lived and entirely harmless. She wanted to kill it but I told her it would make her room smell atrocious. It took some convincing for her to let me wrap it in a paper towel and toss it out the window like I was returning a fish to the ocean. After I shut the window I asked her why she was so afraid of bugs.

“I’m not afraid of bugs.” She replied with a shakiness still lingering in her voice. 

“Just bedbugs. If I see anything small scurrying across my sheets I just get flashbacks to when I was younger. I had a bedbug infestation in my room and my mom threw everything away. Everything. My clothes, my books, family photos. All gone. My life was thrown away and I don’t want to experience that again.”

Cindy had told me other stories about her mom. She wasn’t necessarily what you’d call a role model parent. In fact, she wasn’t even in contact with her anymore. When I saw those spots on my body I remembered the day she shared her fears and refrained from telling her about the implications of my issue. I figured I would deal with it on my own.

After a few weeks or so of new spots appearing I caved in and bought a bottle of bedbug spray. I did research, too. Making sure I was getting my money's worth on the most lethal concoction available to mow down the little bastards. After patiently waiting for a day Cindy would be at work and I would be at the apartment alone, I rigorously vacuumed not just the bedroom but the entire apartment I shoved the sheets, covers, and pillowcases into the washer and then sanitized the hell out of them in the dryer. 

Hopefully 1,000rpm’s along with being cooked alive would kill anything that inhabited our bedding. I did the same with all of our clothes too. I didn’t care if the utility bill came back higher than usual. If questions arose I’d just say I left the faucet running on accident.

As everything was washing and drying I doused our bedroom a few times over with the bug spray. It may have been excessive, but part of me regretted not purchasing a second bottle. Before Cindy returned home I had fixed our bed and stored all of our clothes away exactly how they were previously. Our bed looked so fresh it was hard to resist taking another nap. I thought I would clean up the rest of the apartment since Cindy reminded me some friends, the ones she was with at the cider mill actually, would be over for a small party. I don’t know exactly what they did because I was out with my own friends that night drinking. 

I had only been out an hour and I began feeling lethargic again. After some bargaining with my friends who begged me to stay out longer, I decided to head back home early. When I got home Cindy was cleaning up the party’s aftermath. She didn’t save any of the fruit punch jungle juice for me since I had already had plenty to drink tonight, but that red nectar looked delicious as it went down the drain. She was adamant on thanking me for how clean and organized the apartment looked. But none of it mattered.

The next morning I hurried to the bathroom after my girlfriend had gone to work. Inspecting my back carefully in the mirror, I found another new red spot. I felt like I was going crazy. Anytime from then on I would become anxious spotting anything from dust to dirt on our bedspread, ravenously looming over it like a cat hunting prey.

We showered together that night. She had no red spots. I asked her if she could look at mine.

“You would get those when you were a kid, right? Wasn’t it from stress?”

She was right, I have been stressed due to the whole bedbug thing, and it made it worse that I couldn’t tell her. But I started getting the spots before I was stressed. Unless I could see into the future, it didn’t make sense to me. Saying goodnight to my girlfriend, we tucked ourselves into bed and I faced away from her. I didn’t want her to see my tears. I felt like I failed her.

Paranoid, I couldn’t sleep. Any minor itch on my body ramped up my anxiety. Feeling the individual hairs on my arms and legs rub against the comforter felt like armies of microscopic bugs marching across my skin. Why me? Why did they only want me? I heard her moving around under the covers. Something cold touched my back.

 A sheer stabbing pain.

I squirmed away ravenously and hoisted the covers off me, turning on the bedside lamp. I saw my girlfriend with a syringe in her hand and blood dripping off its metal tip.

“Cindy, what the fuck!?”

She stared at me with a look of what seemed like betrayal.

“You… you don’t love me?”

She immediately began crying, raising the syringe by her head as she balled up. I had never in the span of our relationship seen her so frantically depressed. I was afraid yet wanted to comfort her. Until she gathered herself. Her mood switched instantaneously to resentment. She jumped at me and we fell off the bed. The fall must have winded her because I sprinted outside in my pajamas and ran to a 24/7 diner.

I’m trying to get this all down over a cup of coffee and thought it would help me to share this. I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t have any idea what she would want with my blood and why she would hide this from me for so long. I think her friends just walked in. They all have the same jewelry she had on now. I might just be seeing things that remind me of her, but I also can’t get that look of anger and resentment in her face out of my mind. I’m so tired I think I’m gonna finish up writing here and ask her friends what’s going on.
