“Get the guys down here to the woods by Greenwood.” Gray instructed into his cell phone as I leaned against his car, still unable to wrap my head around what I saw in those trees.

 

“Forensics. Yes... No, not a homicide... Animal cruelty, let’s start there, huh? And that pending missing persons report on Harmony Lavoy, yeah put that shit through. I want all the flight records from our airport to any airport around Paris in the past three months... Well get fucking Gable to do it then, he don’t do nothin’. Alright. Let me know.”

 

Gray hung up the phone and let out a deep sigh.

 

“This shit ain’t good...” He remarked.

 

“Any theories?” I asked.

 

Gray chuckled, “No. I just know a fucking goat head strung up in the woods with a bunch of pentagrams is... It’s dealing in shit that I don’t want to be dealing with.”

 

“You superstitious?”

 

“Nah, but my mother was Puerto Rican, we don’t fuck with these things.”

 

“Have you ever seen something like this before? Has there ever been cult activity or... rituals... satanism... anything like that?”

 

“I’ve seen my fair share of weirdness. I could tell you things you wouldn’t believe about this place... I haven’t seen anything quite like this though.”

 

“Really? I didn’t think there would be much going on over here.”

 

“Most of the time there’s not. But if I’ve learned one thing living here 30 years, it’s that everywhere people exist, bad people exist too. Sometimes very bad people... Out here just gives them more places to hide.”

 

His words hung in my mind for the rest of the night. I didn’t like hearing Gray sound so serious.

 

The next few hours were taxing and I was losing most of my sleep. Once a couple of the guys arrived, Gray and I organized them and led them through the trees. I headed up a small search and Gray oversaw forensics dealing with the goat head. It was well after midnight by the time we were done. One hell of a day.

 

Beyond the scene of the head and the surrounding carvings, nothing else turned up. We would have to work on trying again in the day with more people, I thought.

 

“Hey grandma, come on it’s past your bedtime.” Gray beckoned to me and we got in the car and left.

 

I couldn’t help but look out into the endless waves of trees and wonder what else might be hiding in them. The nothingness spanned for miles behind our quaint little town. So much could be going on that we would never know about, and it could be right on our doorstep. Right behind our houses, right behind those cute little shops. The thought of it made my weary mind spin.

 

“I’ve been thinking...” I began as we drove down the long and endlessly dark road.

 

“Don’t.” Gray cut me off.

 

“What?”

 

“Don’t think. We’re off the clock, Cole. We’re done. Think tomorrow.”

 

“There is no clock, what do you mean? This isn’t a 9 to 5.” I countered.

 

“There’s always a clock. Shut up and listen to me, alright? Because I know how you are.”

 

That last sentence made my blood instantly boil and I snapped back, “You don’t know how I am. You don’t know anything about me.”

 

“When I picked you up and told you about the call, you said you had been “looking into it.” You took your free time, your time at home, to look into a case that wasn’t even a case yet.”

 

“And I got important information.”

 

“I don’t care what you got, and fuck off with the hostility... Kid, you’re going home. So BE home.”

 

“Do not call me kid. Ever. I’m so fucking sick of that. I’m not a kid, and I’m not a rookie, and I don’t need your advice. I’ve been doing perfectly fine before you came along.”

 

“Fine, asshole, you do you then. I’m just trying to keep you sane. You may not be a rookie but I still got at least 10 years on your ass and I’ve seen this shit happen. But if you wanna be arrogant and say it won’t happen to you because you think you’re special, great. Let me know how it works out for you.”

 

“You’re calling ME arrogant? You’ve been strutting around all damn week, undercutting me, undermining me, acting like a big shot-”

 

“Big shot? Me? Never. But I know more than you, and I’ve paid my dues. I just think I’m maybe owed some fucking respect around here.”

 

“Not from me you’re not. Fucking Rodney Dangerfield. I don’t owe you shit.”

 

“You’re a real peach, you know that? Just a delight. I was trying to help you. Fuck me, I guess.”

 

“Yeah I’m good, thanks.” I rebuked with utter venom as the car pulled up to my building. I wasted no time getting out and shutting the door behind me before he could make any more stupid comments.

 

My skin was hot and I was seething but I couldn’t help but laugh as I got back to my apartment. It had been awhile since anyone got a rise out of me like he did. I prided myself on unwavering and stoic professionalism. Kill them with kindness. I’ve been told I have a hard head, but I’ve never been told I have a temper. I suppose it was helpful of him to remind me that I do.

 

It’s not even like what he said was wrong. Hell, maybe I was angry only because he wasn’t. But it did no good to stew on that now.

 

As for the rest of the night, my urge was to continue working just to spite him. Come in tomorrow having cracked the code and lay it all out to his stupid face. But two things stopped me from doing that. One: I’m a professional, and that would be very childish of me. Two: I was beyond tired and I only had about four hours left to sleep. I wasn’t about to let pettiness ruin my schedule already.

 

I decided to watch a few more of Harmony’s vlogs as I laid in bed. Not entirely sure why. It felt like a small compromise between the part of me that itched to keep working and the part of me that needed sleep. Something still relevant, but not so in the weeds that it would prevent me from drifting off... Or maybe it was just to see a single friendly face before I went to sleep.

 

Harmony had tons of videos all over the spectrum, from 10 second TikToks, to 8 hour live streams, and everything in between. I always knew people did this stuff, and I knew it could be lucrative, but I never fully understood it. Why would someone want to be so public? So open? The thought made me nervous. But she owned it, and she seemed to genuinely love it. The “SFW” side anyway, I didn’t look much into the other side. I couldn’t imagine that was as jovial.

 

The more I watched, the more I could see what it was that she got out of it. It would be easy and quite cynical to say that she was vain. She loved the attention, and she loved the money. But that wasn’t it. Or if it was, she hid it well. It seemed to me that she just liked people. She liked talking to people. She liked connecting with people. A lot of folks in the chats of her streams she would talk to like they were childhood friends. Granted, these chats were certainly heavily moderated, but still... She was an extrovert and a people person in a way that couldn’t be manufactured.

 

It only made me more concerned and confused about the girl in the woods. I wanted to convince myself that it wasn’t her. That she was still in Paris, completely fine, not wrapped up in whatever the fuck this was. Logic and evidence told me that was the truth. But my eyes and my gut said it was her out there.

 

I was about ready to put the phone away, but one more video caught my eye. A live stream. Uploaded a mere week before the Paris trip. It was titled “Trying Spooky Sleepover Games.” I always had a thing for those, they were charming and cozy, even if I seldom could convince anyone to join me. I pressed play.

 

“Hello, my lovelies!” Harmony greeted the camera stationed on her computer desk. “Hello Fly, Dino, Shy Guy, Ders, Chugs, Monique, Happy Well, Zero, Lightbody, Huevos, Kyana... Wow, the crew is all here! Hello, hello, my super sexy friends, I pie you all, I hope you’re all having a wonderful Friday!”

 

I didn’t understand the pie thing. She referenced pie often. Some kind of in-joke.

 

“It’s a night owl stream tonight, because we’re gonna try something cool and spooky. I’ve been wanting to do something like this for a while, actually. We’re going to do a couple of those scary urban legend type games, because I love them so much. So we got ‘Bloody Mary’ obviously, I spent all day getting the supplies to play ‘Hide and Seek Alone’ so we’re gonna do that one too, and a couple others which we’ll get to. But the main reason we’re doing this today... You may have seen a couple of these videos going around, or you may not. It’s not that popular yet, but it’s super cool, there’s a brand new one circulating. Astral told me about it, and it sounds like fun. But if I get possessed, you can all blame her. It’s called The Candle Caine Game...”

 

I jolted to attention. What the fuck did she just say? It was a game? I skipped forward, past all the other silly rituals and the chatting, to find when she played it. I came upon a section where she sat at her desk in the dark, illuminated by a small lit candle in front of her. That had to be it.

 

“Okay, I think we got everything. Candle, and I got a mirror leaned against my monitor. I can see myself in it clearly, and I’m pretty sure I got the words down right... here we go...”

 

The set up seemed simple enough and not too dissimilar from any other game of its kind. But something deep inside me really didn’t like it.

 

Silently, she closed her right eye, then she drew a small circle with her finger on the mirror. Maybe she was circling something in her reflection, by the angle it was hard to tell for sure. Then she opened her eye again.

 

She held her hand out flat over top of the candle’s flame and took a few deep breaths, then she began to speak.

 

[“Candle Caine walks in the candle light. Can’t wear skin, it is far too tight.]()

He makes no sound, he leaves no tracks. Candle Caine lives in the candle wax.

A toast to you, this wondrous night. I hope to sate your appetite.

One eye missing, one will remain. I now belong to Candle Caine.”

 

A bizarre little rhyme and ceremony. I had never heard anything like it before... except for the last line. So what was it? A burgeoning internet fad, sure, but why did Melvin know what it was? A 52 year old homeless man... how would he know? He had a niece... could that be it? Did his niece find it and it just stuck with him for whatever reason? That was the most logical explanation that I could think of...

 

Harmony then counted aloud to 13 and blew out the candle, leaving the video dark for a few seconds. With a flick of the lighter, the candle illuminated once more. Harmony took a look around her room, and a small smirk appeared on her face.

 

“Okay, well, I don’t think it worked, but that’s okay... Supposedly the eye you circled in your reflection will be gone from the mirror when you re-light the candle, and then a ghostly wax hand will put out the flame... and then you... I don’t know... die, or whatever... But I think I’m good. I mean, my eye’s still here. Definitely didn’t see a wax hand... But it was fun though, right? Kinda creepy. I just love that people are still making these, you know? Haven’t had a new one in a while. We need more...”

 

I guess that was all there was to it. I don’t know what I expected. It was pretty par for the course, kinda creepy, kinda fun. But I couldn’t stop wondering how... How was a silly game from the internet tied into what was happening in this little Nova Scotia town? It didn’t add up.

 

Sleep was coming fast however, so I had to let it go for the moment. I slowly drifted from my consciousness. My hand began to tip my phone over, so I put it away and let myself fade.

 

The dream I had that night was unlike any I had ever had.

 

I was in my bedroom. Not this bedroom, but the one from my childhood. It was dark but I could still see the garish teal walls adorned with posters of pro wrestlers and movies of the time. But I noticed the door to the room began to close. I used to always be afraid someone would be hiding behind it, as the open door would perfectly conceal the darkest corner.

 

The door closed agonizingly slow. As it did, my fears were proven true. There was a figure hiding behind the door, in the dark. A man in a wide-brimmed hat. He began moving closer towards me and no matter how hard I tried, my body wouldn’t budge. He was just a pitch black shape. A shadow. No features.

 

He held a cup out to me. Some kind of ceremonial goblet, or chalice. He wanted me to drink from it, but when I looked into the cup, it was filled with blood. I saw my reflection in the blood. I was missing an eye. Then when I looked back to the man, I saw the severed goat’s head upon his shoulders.

 

I screamed and screamed but the sound wouldn’t come out. It got hotter and hotter in the room and I began to perspire. Then I realized it wasn’t sweat dripping off of me, it was wax. I was wax, and I was melting. My skin was liquifying, bubbling, and dripping down my body and still I couldn’t move. Nor could I take my eyes off of the goat man. It stared into me with its single eye and then the room caught fire.

 

I was petrified. I felt tears stream down my face, only I knew they weren’t tears. I looked down to my hands as my fingers melted away, and when I looked back once again it wasn’t the hat man or the goat man anymore... It was Harmony. She stood before me in the fire, naked and smiling the most evil grin. Her left eye was missing too.

 

She climbed on the bed and crawled on top of me. I felt her fingers dig into my liquid flesh as she cupped what used to be my face. Then she whispered something into what used to be my ear. But I couldn’t hear it. The fire engulfed the bed and both of us with it. I melted away in her arms.

 

I woke up. My heart was pounding out of my chest, and I really was dripping with sweat now. I left a whole imprint in the bed. I looked at the clock and I still had an hour left before I would have to get up, but there was no way I was going to be able to fall back to sleep. Not anymore.

 

I spent the morning trying to shake everything off. I felt a bit dizzy and there was a creeping, throbbing pain in my head. A pressure building, like someone stuck a pole up behind my eye. I took some painkillers, then I began my morning routine. All the same, except I gave myself a little bit of grace with the workout...

 

I got to HQ at 7:30 and I saw Gray’s car already parked in the lot. I almost forgot I would have to endure another day of him.

 

“Cole!” He called out to me in an almost cheery way. I guess he was over last night. “Ready for the fun shit?”

 

“What are we doing today?” I asked.

 

“How do you fancy looking at 50 pages of flight records this morning?” He responded, gesturing to a stack of papers on the desk.

 

“I thought we might organize a search party or something...”

 

“Workin’ on all that. But first it would be nice to prove that our missing girl is actually missing, right? As of now we only have your inconclusive testimony, and the old lady’s.”

 

I sat down at the desk and looked at the papers. “Why is this printed? Can’t I pull this up on the computer?”

 

Gray scoffed, “Gen Z... What’s wrong with paper? It’s better, it’s solid.”

 

“Late millennial, thank you. And if I pull up the documents online, I can just do a search for her name and it’ll take two seconds. They were sent to the drive, yeah?”

 

Gray rolled his eyes, “You do you.”

 

I hopped on the computer and got to work.

 

“So let me ask you then, since you’re so smart” Gray began. “How is she in two places at once? How do you explain the videos, and the location data on the videos? She have an evil twin or somethin’?”

 

“I think the mother would know if that were the case.” I answered, even though I knew that wasn’t a serious suggestion from him. “The location data... it IS possible to fake that if she has a VPN.” I added.

 

“Okay...” Gray replied. From his tone I couldn’t tell if he knew what a VPN was. “The videos themselves then?”

 

“...Filmed in advance?”

 

“Go on.”

 

“Maybe she went to Paris, filmed a bunch of stuff, then came back early, and has been posting it after the fact. Acting like she’s still there.”

 

“But why?”

 

“I don’t know...” I relented.

 

I got the records pulled up. It was time to find out.

 

Page by page and flight by flight I did a search for her name amongst the passengers.

 

Zero results, zero results, zero results. Every single time. As I got closer and closer to the end it only got more unbelievable. Then I hit the end, and my heart truly sank.

 

There was no flight. None departing, none returning. Harmony was never in Paris.
