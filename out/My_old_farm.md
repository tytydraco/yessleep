About 6 years ago my dad used to rent a small portion of land his friend was using for farming 


Said friend owned almost 20 acres of land,the north and East side of the plot was surrounded by forest. my dad rented about 5 acres also for farming my dad tells me he paid 5k every two months which is pretty good 


I didn’t live with my dad at the time of this I only went over on weekends because there was not school near our land and honestly I didn’t like the farm so I wasn’t upset that I didn’t live with him


One of the said weekends I was at my dads I am pretty sure it was summer as we where having a bonfire that night so we where going to out late 


My dads 5 acres where on the north-west side of the land like I said earlier the north to the east side was covered in forest we never went into the forest because of wild animals and stuff like that  


as the sun set we gathered wood and stuff to burn like food scraps and cardboard to start the fire my dads friend also got stuff for s’mores so at a probably 7y/o and my sister being probably 6 we where pretty exited  


Soon after we all (me my father, sister, and said friend that owned the land) where sat by the fire and getting stuff for s’mores ready out of the corner of my eye I saw something moving over by to forest I turned my head looking to see what it was I didn’t see anything though 


About 3ish minutes later I saw it again I taped my sister on the shoulder and asked if she saw it she raised an eyebrow I shook my head telling her never mind but she just looked behind me 


I turned around and stared into the darkness my dad looked at us and than behind him soon his friend did too


As we all looked into the dark we heard branches snap so my dad quickly got up grabbed me and my sister and rushed us into our house his friend put out the fire and we sat in the house for what felt like hours


There was a banging on the front door my dad held me and my sister as his friend yelled that we are armed and aren’t afraid my dads friend wasn’t lying my dad did have multiple protective things but it felt like he was because of the shake in his voice 


The banging continued for I little wile longer and than finally stoped there was one last bang on the door and than you could hear whatever was out there walk away 


My dads friend stayed with us that night and my dad spent his next to months worth of rent on security cameras that my dad and his friend put up 


If you are wondering my dad did move out about 3 years later
