Dear Jodie,

I'm writing this letter to you and you only, I need you to understand my thoughts and why I did what I did. I want you to put yourself in my eyes and see what I saw, what I felt. You need to understand that if I could go back I would with no hesitation. 

No more bullshit, I promise. If that means anything to you anymore.

I remember what I was doing when I found the pills, why I did what I did, why I felt like I needed it at the time, I remember it all. Yes, I lied, I had to as there was no way at the time my mind could wrap what was going on between us. In my shoes you would've done the same. 

Being an addict isn't easy Jodie, not at all. It haunted me every day. Sat with me by my side as she does now. 

I don't have to tell you that though, you understand...

Walking to the park that day I had so much running through my head. Looking down at Brooke you could tell she was thinking of the same things I was. The divorce was taking our minds in horrible places that day, so I thought. You know how I get my mind runs in the opposite of those who want to help. I believe Brooke picked up on those traits as well because she wouldn't open up to me at the time. First time I felt so distant from my own child. 

"Heys, you want to go get ice cream before the park?" I offered as the bright and hot sun beamed down on us.

In that moment is when I knew she wasn't going to talk with me all day. I started getting in my own head afterwards thinking you may have said something to her, trying to make me the bad guy. Started thinking about all the ideas you could've thrown at her the nights before. 

"Brooke baby I know I'm not your favorite person in the world right now, but I'd like if you could still talk with me." I followed. "You have to talk to me at some point to tell me whether or not you're hungry orrrr maybe when you have to go use the bathr-"

She ran towards the park once it got in her vision ignoring what I was saying to her. How could I blame her though, I was in the wrong. I understood all the anger she had towards me. 

Wish some of it went towards you at the time so I could at least talk with my daughter. Wish I knew what you told her. Wish she knew the truth.

Sitting down at the bench I had always sat at facing the park, my thoughts got the best of me. As I watched my beautiful girl run around the playground talking with other kids I... got jealous. I got anxious, I was horrified. Minutes ago, she wouldn't bat an eye at me let alone talk to me and if it was so easy for her to switch between those two faces I worried about our relationship. 

Sitting there biting my lip, I noticed it. In the corner of my eye in the bush stood out a darker green then the rest. I don't know why I did but it intrigued me more than my own daughter maybe the distraction from her at the time was what I was looking for or what I needed.

Walking towards the bush and getting on one knee I knew what it was we both know what it was.

Looking in the bag I saw two pills I've never seen before. Anyone with a normal brain would have looked at this and either put it back or thrown it away. I, at the time, did not have a normal brain at least not one that could tell me from right or wrong. Looking back up at Brooke and seeing her smile with the other kids, it was the only high I chased.

What had just destroyed my family I was willing to do again. Scariest part of this story to me was that I took both pills not knowing what could happen. What they were. 

Sitting back on the bench it took a few minutes before anything really happen. When it did it felt like I was sitting on a bench made of memory foam. In which I slowly sunk into until what felt like I fell through the damn thing landing on the bench once again. Repeating this process over and over striking me with the realization at the time that this was the strongest drug I've taken. 

What mattered to me was that it cleared my mind, made me feel ok with where I was and didn't have to worry about my daughter. Well felt like that until I looked up at the playground to see Brooke standing at the top facing me. 

I'm telling you Jodie, she was trying to tell me something I swear. I could see the resistant in her face. She wanted to scream it at me. It was eating her alive. I knew it was because I could see them moving around under her skin. The words running from her veins around her body going up towards her head and getting trapped behind her boarded up mouth. 

Within seconds the lighting changed, and it had looked like I could see the equator mixed with the horizon.

I looked down at my watch and noticed we had been there for hours. In fact, almost the whole day. 

Jodie I never left that park neither did Brooke. We were there the whole time no matter what witnesses say. Yes, I understand I had just taken drugs but that's more of a better reason that I believe we never left. You know how I am, why the fuck would I get up from the park other than go back to the house?

That's what I wanted to do, I looked at the watch and looked for her to go back. Looking up was the hardest thing I've done almost like ten bricks were placed on a board and tied to my head. It just wouldn't lift. So I sat there for another minute letting my body get it's shit together. Going through my thoughts once again. 

Going through memories. Family memories. Our memories.

I believe that is what gave me the power and energy to withstand the bricks and stand up. Looking up had only made my heart drop.

All the kids were gone. 

As I started freaking out internally not being able to shout. I ran around the playground looking for Brooke. I worried even more until I ran pass the tubed slide and saw feet hanging out from in the tunnel. 

"Brooke?" my gated mouth had been unlocked. 

There was no movement but as I got closer and reached my arms in the tube I pulled the bottom half of my daughter out. There was movement but she was asleep. 

It was her words trying to escape her body as it just had happened, or so I thought it had just happened. Closer to her it looked like her veins had turned into snakes and were slithering around her body looking for an opening. They moved fast and at the time it looked somewhat normal. 

So, I grabbed sleeping beauty and threw her up and around my shoulders to walk her back home. 

The high was gone once I got home and thought the drugs were out of my system now. I placed her on the couch and looked more into her skin. They were gone; everything was gone. 

I sat there with my daughter beside me believing this would be the last time in a long time. Something no father should have to think about in my eyes. It was painful and hurt every second I thought about the fact I'd be losing her soon. Although forever wasn't even in the question at the time. 

Waiting for you to get home felt like an eternity but I needed that eternity. I needed it forever. 

Looking at her calm and still face with her eyes shut was like looking at an angel who hadn't slept since falling from heaven. Which was weird because Angels can sense a demons' presence. 

The devil was beside her.

I felt her moving around trying to get more comfortable, so I backed away to let her get comfy. As I did, I then noticed it wasn't her that was moving, it was inside her. 

At the time I wasn't on the drugs anymore, so I didn't understand how they were still there. I started freaking out because everything else around me was normal. What was wrong with my girl? What was in her and was it real or was I tripping? Having withdrawals?

I grew more fear as the snakes seemed to have been moving around more and faster. Her skin bulging in and out all over. It wasn't until her eyes flung open with dark red eyes and tears flowing from them that I grabbed her and placed her on the table. 

"BROOKE HEY BABY CAN YOU HEAR ME?" I screamed. "BROOKE?" 

I thought before this was all in my head, I thought it was from the two pills I took but what if she had been trying to tell me about these things this whole time. At the top of the playground, she was trying to tell me about them. She needed my help and all I did was sit there on the bench.

"Jodie was right, oh my god she was right!" I kept thinking to myself. 

I ran into the kitchen grabbed a knife and ran back to my daughter who had still not said a word but could tell she was in pain and agony. 

"BROOKE PLEASE SAY SOMETHING TELL ME WHAT TO DO!" I demanded.

As the snakes grew bigger and started getting closer to her head, I knew what I had to do. 

I tore her shirt off her to reveal her stomach that had been overrun by thousands of her own snake veins. Her stomach pouncing out and moving in spiral ways I've only seen a slinky move in such ways. 

Tears ran through down my face as I knew what I had to do but also the fact that I couldn't do anything about the pain she was in. 

Her face redder than ever, mouth open to the point it wasn't natural, her eyes becoming bloodshot, and her body moving up and down thrashing against the table. 

"IM SO SORRY MY GIRL, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!" I shouted as I lifted the knife but before leading it into her torso I heard the first noise from my daughter all day. Not the noise you'd like to hear from a seven-year-old. 

Uncontrollably she ran her head to the back of the table and let out a belch as loud as a lighthouse siren and so long to the point her face was purple. 

In complete fear I drew the knife back down into her stomach and started going up with it. Leaving a long and open whole in her stomach. All vein snakes that look like her intestines emerging from it and trying to escape her body. The snakes wrapping around me and herself. Covering me in my daughter's blood. I repeated jamming the knife into the open wound trying to kill as many of the snakes as I could, going far enough to having the knife come out the other side of the table. 

That's it Jodie. That's what happen. That's when you walked in. 

Please how do I explain this to anyone? I was fucked from the beginning. No one would believe what had happen whether the drugs were involved or not. 

I loved my daughter Jodie you know I did. She was everything to me. 

I would have never been eating our daughter alive. I would have never had my daughter's intestines in my mouth. I would have never done anything so sinister and painful to my daughter. I will never understand why you had placed those drugs in the park that day. Yes, I figured it out overtime. 

Justice will serve to my daughter one day as that is what she deserves. What everyone deserves. What I deserve. The truth. 

You set me up Jodie. I fucking hate you and hope you rot in hell. 

Whether my story or yours is right. I cannot live with this. I have snakes in my skin that must come out when I see her. My mouth is locked as hers was, gated. I'll be with my baby soon...
