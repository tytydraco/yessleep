The first thing I did when I finished reading the translation was gulp down an entire litre of water. My throat had become parched due to my mouth hanging agape the entire time.

What I had just read shared more in common to the Historical Fiction stories I had written, rather than History. Minus the supernatural element of course. That was by far the most unsettling bit about it, and I couldn’t stop the automatic questions that began to spawn in my head as a result.

*What if inside WAS haunted by spirits?*

*What if Herod WAS buried within?*

*What if all that Salome had witnessed WAS in fact the TRUTH?*

History is filled with references to the supernatural; spells, curses, prayers and incantations that could be found in many different places, tombs being the most common. Crypts of Egyptian Pharaohs have been unearthed, graves and catacombs across Europe scraped clean of treasures specifically given to the dead. Yet, in all of these situations, any references to curses upon the living are never taken seriously. And why should they? Thousands of tombs have been raided and none have ever recorded being haunted after. It was all just the plain old superstitions of a far less educated people from a different time period.

But, the inscription within the *Hamsa* hands on the wall, seemed different. I felt it with every educated strand in my mind.

No one had ever put in as much effort as Salome had to conceal a supposedly dangerous place. If the elaborate patterns and extremely long text on the wall were not a job enough to conduct, then the construction of this secondary seal and the subsequent burial of it all that she mentioned at the end of her text gave enough indication that her intentions went far beyond the cliche of her time.

In my analytical mind, I knew it was just an extremely elaborate example of the fear of the supernatural that was common in ancient times. But the nauseating feeling in my guts, and the throbbing in my chest were only present because I was not wholly content. Something was off about this place.

I slept very little that night, my mind constantly recounting pivotal moments within the text that just so happened to be the most chilling. After all the research I had conducted on Salome, not once was there ever a mention of her connection to key biblical events, and particularly to Heralds of God. She was just a Herodian princess tied to the intrigues of Herod’s court. By the time sleep did come, I was under the conclusion that the inscription had not been translated properly. It was the only logical explanation.

When morning came, I was very eager to meet with Naeem and Mia and hear their opinions of it. It was just before sunrise when I knocked on the door of Naeem’s accommodation.

“This better not be some sick joke,” I said as soon as he answered.

His eyes darted about as he scanned the base behind me for anyone who might have followed me. He jerked his head in a gesture for me to enter, and stood by the door as I brushed past him. He threw the door shut, but withdrew at the last moment to ensure a smooth and gentle latching.

He turned to me, his eyes a mix of hope and eagerness. “You’ve read it all?”

I scoffed. “Nah, I just went to sleep without reading the very text at the centre of the lie that brought me to this place. Now you be transparent with me, Naeem. This is no joke?”

Naeem’s eyes widened and he shook his head vigorously. “Denial is a dangerous emotion when it comes to confronting that which is out of the ordinary. Please, Corey, you know I didn’t drag you here to the West Bank whilst my grandchildren were held hostage just to play some elaborate prank on your educated ego. What you read has been translated almost word for word. The only parts I may have added in were some definite articles for grammar’s sake, but that’s it!”

I sighed, rubbing my poorly rested face with my hand as I collapsed onto a recliner lounge that was beckoning me. “I’m sorry, Naeem. I believe you. It’s just so difficult to comprehend.”

Naeem flicked on the kettle and sat beside me as it began to boil. “Trust me, I had the same reaction as yourself. Mia too. Just be thankful you got to read it all in one sitting. We had to read it at the agonizing pace of the excavation. We would reach a certain point and be desperate to know what happened next but had to wait another week or two until the layer of text below was unearthed.”

“Do you believe it is true?” I asked.

Naeem hesitated for a moment. “Well, I hope not, considering the reasoning behind it all. But you’re the Salome expert, so I was hoping to hear your perspective on such a recount being consistent with her character. Thats the first step before we can go any further with this.”

The kettle reached its boil and as Naeem poured me a cup of coffee, I told him that I did believe it was Salome who had written it. It had been a rather personal retelling of her experiences, nothing like all the source material available that I used for my paper on her. There were references to several historical events, and being told through her POV, I supposed that they did line up as close to what she would have likely experienced.

“What worries me more,” I continued, as Naeem handed me the warm mug of coffee, “is the historical events that are mentioned are quite inconsistent with what has already been recorded.”

Naeem shrugged as he sipped from his cup. “She makes a point of mentioning Nicholas of Damascus, the court historian. He was present for many of that which he recorded, but what if he was only able to record certain events purely out of reliance of someone else’s word for it? Take Antipater’s death for instance. Josephus and Nicholas have recorded him being taken to Caesarea and imprisoned for some time before being executed. What if, Salome’s account is the truth and this was merely the fabrication she told the court when she arrived after witnessing the grizzly end of the prince. We have no other sources to go off, so I’d give that a fair chance.”

I shuddered as I recalled the imagery of Antipater being turned into a bloody dough. It prompted the barrage of questions of the true troubling aspects of the text to come forth.

“Alright, forget historical authenticity. Let’s talk about the…supernatural…things,” I said.

Naeem gulped. “Straight to the crunch then. Good. Well, it sure gives me goosebumps to think that King Herod may very much still be alive, albeit in a tormented state, right beneath our feet.”

“There’s that. But what about this whole bitterness of the Spirits of the children of Bethlehem within? So dangerous they are that a Herald of God was forced to intervene and order the very erection of the wall?”

Naeem nodded. “It definitely doesn’t make me want to go further with the project, wouldn’t you agree?”

I did.

As I said, despite many ancient tombs having some eerie warnings or curses upon them, the effort that went into keeping this place closed off really made me uncomfortable. I believed it was well to respect Salome’s wishes and leave the place alone.

Mia entered, and after catching up to where me and Naeem were at, she sat next to me on the recliner, close enough that our thighs were touching. I felt a moments distraction from the topic of conversation.

“In the end, it is only the three of us here who know that there is actually more to this site than the monolith which has already been uncovered,” Naeem said. “All we have to do, is misinform Suffian that the monolith is nothing more than an inscription detailing the life of Salome. We can use your expertise, Corey, on her character, to fabricate such a text.”

I chuckled bitterly, even though I was sort of in agreement with Naeem. “So here is the crux of me being here then. You are too afraid to enter the tomb, so wish to alter the truth of the text to give Suffian no need to go further. You needed an expert on Salome who can write up the most accurate one imaginable.”

Naeem was silent as he chewed on his gums.

Mia placed a tender hand on my arm and gave me a reassuring smile. “I’ve tried telling him it won’t work. Suffian is a tyrant when it comes to getting this place unearthed, and I fear that his measures will become even more drastic when he learns that the place is not the tomb of Herod that he thought it was.”

Naeem stood up with an exasperated look on his face. “Mia, Salome has made her warning clear enough, and it is up to us to decide if it should be respected or ignored.” He ran a finger along the edge of a steel ring planted on his index finger. It had an Islamic verse written upon it. “I may be an academic, but I am a devout Muslim, which makes me understand one thing. If Allah Wills this place to be sealed, then it is my duty to make sure it remain so.”

I couldn’t argue against that. I was no Muslim, and definitely not the devout Catholic that my parents would have wanted. But in the end, if, just IF, Salome was telling the truth of there being bitter spirits within the tomb, I would much prefer to leave it alone.

And so, for the next three days as we awaited Suffian’s return, I worked closely with Naeem and Mia, editing the translation to such an extreme that by the time we reached the finished product the only original part was the scene of Salome helping Joseph escape Bethlehem with the help of her lover, David. The rest was, in the end, a very well researched biography told in the first person.

My nervous anticipation of confronting Suffian for the first time was temporarily put at ease by my evening flings in Mia’s apartment. When we weren’t working on our presentation for Suffian - a rarity - we fucked. I’ve had many flings with women over the years, but the sex with Mia definitely came with a measure of passion. When we had finished, we would lie in each other’s arms, and, despite the more demanding tasks at hand, talked about our lives. The sex was amazing, but it was these conversations that I looked forward to the most. With the few opportunities we had, I managed to learn so much about her. I knew I was falling in love with this girl of simple origins who had defied her family’s expectations to become the educated woman she was today. Her love was vigorously returned.

When Suffian arrived at the site, he did so with all the pomp that I had been expecting. The entire team stationed at the site, from labourers, Archaeologists, us three Historians, cooks, machinery maintenance crew, and security personnel, lined the cleared section of the plateau that served as the carpark, as a convoy of military grade vehicles pooled into the site. Dust filled the air and choked our lungs as we stood there as though we were waiting for the Queen. All up, twenty vehicles had entered. Hamza stepped out from the tenth vehicle, a cigarette jutting from his mouth and making no effort in concealing the two pistols holstered beneath his bullet proof vest. He made his way to the passenger door and opened it.

Out came a tall man wearing a plain blue button up shirt. His full head of thick white hair was cropped short, a stark comparison to his dark bushy eyebrows and moustache. His face seemed inclined to a perpetual scowl. He gave me the instant impression of someone who always got his way and would refuse to compromise for anything. He had the look of one not unused to ordering death.

He scanned the gathered people and when his eyes fell upon Naeem’s - a gesture that made the professor quake - he approached us, Hamza and his security team following close behind.

“Suffian, it is good to see you,” Naeem said in a supplicating tone. He looked exactly like how I imagined a slave addressing their master in ancient times.

Without even an acknowledgment of the greeting, Suffian bore his hard gaze onto me. “You are the scholar from Italy?” he asked in heavily accented English.

“Yes.”

For what felt like an eternity, I was imprisoned by his scowling face as his eyes seemed to reach into my very soul to analyse my character. I wouldn’t have been surprised if he pulled out a knife and began to saw at my throat.

“Good. Tell me what is written on that wall,” Suffian said, straight to the point.

Naeem shuffled forward. “Suffian, come to my accommodation, it’ll be easier to discuss it-“

“You’ve had enough time. I want answers. Now!” Suffian spat. Hamza rested his hand upon the holster of his gun, adding further emphasis to Suffian’s demand.

Suffian’s eyes continued to bear down on me as I struggled to find the words as to how I was going to address the situation. I was for the life of me not expecting to be thrown straight into the deep end like this. Logic had compelled me to believe that after greeting us, Suffian would have retired with the three of us to the comfort and quiet of one of the accommodations. There we could have had him read our fabricated translation before addressing him as we had already rehearsed. This had just thrown all planning right out the window. We didn’t even have the fabricated translation on us to refer to.

In that moment I was about to give in. I was about to tell the lie we had agreed on. Threat from this demanding politician or not, I was not going to allow him to violate Salome’s warning and unleash a potential evil upon the Earth.

But just as I was about to speak, Mia stepped forward.

“There’s more to the site! What has been uncovered is only a secondary seal for the true seal of the tomb. You can go further!”

Both me and Naeem glared at Mia with wide eyes. I was horrified that she would tell the truth so easily. All the last days hard work of fabricating the story to conceal the truth had been for nothing.

Suffian’s eyebrows raised in response to the remark, but he kept his gaze locked on me.  “Do not speak out of turn, Woman, I want to hear what this foreigner has to say about it.”

If the setting had been somewhere a lot more casual, I would have broken the nose on that scowling face as compensation for his rude remark.

Seeing no other way out of this, I did what Naeem didn’t want. I told Suffian a summary of the true translation. All the while, I could see Naeem’s head lowered and tears wetting the dust at his feet. At one point, Mia placed a hand on his shoulder, only for him to pull away aggressively. Suffian noticed the gesture.

Suffian nodded his head when I finished, “Good.”

There was a drawn-out silence as I awaited some comment from the politician about the supernatural events within the text.

Suffian turned to the group of archaeologists standing next to us and addressed their team leader, Milad. “We will recommence the excavations today. I want that marble slab broken through by whatever means necessary.”

I was aghast. It was as though Suffian had been deaf to the entire warning that had been the purpose of the text.

Milad inclined his head, “Sir, shall we not try to preserve the entire slab? Itself is an artefact worthy of care.”

“Did you take plenty of photos of it?” Suffian said.

“Well, yes. But-

“Thats good enough. We have the translated text and visual reference. We do not need to keep it. What lies behind it is a treasure far more worthy of retaining.”

Now Naeem stepped forward, gone was his miserable and subservient composure. He stood before Suffian, head held high in defiance, his features twisted in disgust. “Will you not heed the warning?” he snapped.

Suffian sneered at the professor, and for the first time, chuckled. “What warning? All I hear is Christian garbage. As a Muslim, I do not believe that Jesus the Prophet was divine, therefore any reference to the Christian story of his birth is irrelevant to me.”

“But what if it is?” Naeem pleaded. “Allah willed the secondary seal according to the text. We can’t just ignore it!”

Suffian hawked and spat a large gobbet of phlegm at Naeem’s feet. “You are a blaspheming infidel to believe Allah had any part in. As I said, it is an offshoot of a key Christian story, therefore it is all a lie.” Suffian turned and addressed the gathered staff. “The excavations will recommence. Palestine will have claim to the true final resting place of King Herod.” He clapped his hands impatiently and gesticulated for everyone to hurry off to commence their work. None disobeyed.

Instead of following the order, Naeem stood there laughing. Suffian turned to him and slapped him hard across the face. It did little to falter his unexpected joviality. He pointed a finger at Suffian as he spoke, “You claim to be a devout Muslim. Look at you! You refuse to believe that the warning was placed by Allah, yet you clearly believe the story enough to have such a strong certainty Herod is in there. Everything you just said, reeks of hypocrisy. You do not respect Allah. You are only compelled by greed which deafens you to His word, only allowing your ears to perceive that which you want to hear.”

In a swift motion, Suffian buried his hand in one of his pants pockets and pulled out a switch blade. Before any of us could react, he lunged at Naeem and stabbed him three times in the throat.

Mia screamed and attempted to run to the professor’s side, but was held back by one of Hamza’s security personnel. Another came to my side, but I was too frozen in shock for him to have to restrain me. I watched with wide eyes as Naeem held his bleeding throat, gasping for breath as blood bubbled around his mouth. He looked at me for a brief moment and moved his mouth where I could just make out the words, “Don’t open it”. He then collapsed face first on the dusty ground and was no more.

“You fucking bastard!” Mia screamed at Suffian, who was crouched beside Naeem indifferently wiping the blood off his blade on his shirt. “He only spoke the truth!”

Suffian stood up and stepped towards her, holding his now cleaned knife to her face. For an agonizing moment, I was certain she would be following Naeem.

“Truth!!” Suffian spat. “I see the truth! That Naeem and you knew all along what was written on that wall. That you only brought this foreigner in, to delay the further excavations!”

I could see Mia about to come up with something, and fear for her wellbeing took a hold of me. “It’s true!” I shouted. “Naeem only brought me here to delay the dig, as you said. But Mia had no part in it! She stressed to the professor that it was folly to do so. But he refused to listen to her. And now look where he ended up. Please, let Mia go!”

Suffian flicked his blood red eyes to me and snickered. “I admire your heroics, foreigner, but don’t think me a fool on how the world works. Your lover here, yes, it’s obvious that she is, is equally as guilty as the professor. Herself being a Christian, and a pretty one at that, I am not surprised that a Muslim like Naeem would turn his back on Allah and believe the lie. Women are excellent at seeping their poison into a respectable man’s mind.”

His eyes fell to her throat, and I knew what his intentions were. In seconds this beautiful, sophisticated woman who had stolen my heart the moment I met her, would be killed. My mind scrambled for a way to save her whilst restrained.

“YOU NEED HER!” I roared. Suffian halted at that. “Now that Naeem is gone, she is the most superior historian tied to this project! Kill her, and you risk the integrity of whatever it is you find in there! Without a Historian, no one will believe the monumental discovery you are so adamant in making.”

Suffian lowered his knife and put it back in his pocket. He released his hold of Mia and she immediately collapsed into my arms, crying hard into my chest. I held her close as I glared at that monster of a man who dared to accuse her of being responsible for her superior’s beliefs.

“You are right, foreigner, thank you for staying my hand before impulse took it. I will spare her. But neither of you will have a part in this project until you are needed. I will not allow two Christians who had worked with one that was willing to delay the dig out of fear for a lie, to roam about and sow their ideas into good Muslims. Naeem has already cost me enough time, so you lot will not be given the chance to do the same.”

And so it was that Mia and I were imprisoned within Naeem’s accommodations. Suffian ordered Hamza to station security personnel at every window and door. For the first few minutes of this imprisonment we sat on the sofa as I held her trembling form close to me as she wept for Naeem. We were soon interrupted when Suffian barged through the door holding my laptop, opened up with its screen displaying the beginning of a Word document. It was the fabricated story we had intended to tell him. I sighed, knowing there was little I could do to get out of this situation. The paranoid fuck had wasted no time searching through “the foreigners” belongings.

I was roughly torn away from Mia who cried after me, and dragged by two security personnel to my accommodation. I was given another lecture by Suffian on his mistrust of Mia and I, followed by the flexing of his good faith to Allah. I received several punches and kicks by Hamza to drive home the point. They seized my laptop, phone and any other device they deemed I could use to communicate with the outside world, before I was finally left alone. Suffian made some small adjustments to our imprisonment, and a second team of personnel were needed to guard my accommodations. Mia and I were to remain separated for the duration of incarceration.

Little happened for the next month. When I wasn’t worrying about Mia’s wellbeing, I spent most of my solitude in reflection on the text. I was fortunate enough to still have the original translation folder, so I re read it a number of times. With each reading I became evermore certain that Salome was telling the truth and that God truly did send his Herald down to prompt her to ensure the tomb remained sealed forever.

I reflected on one of the chilling lines towards the end of the text: *There is no knowing what position God will be in to counter them.*

What could possibly tie up the supposed omniscient creator of everything so much that he couldn’t send down a single Herald to shun the Spirits again? It was infuriating that the Herald had mentioned the nature of the Spirits bitterness, but nothing on ways they could be countered without God’s intervention. It only stressed the doom and gloom that awaited those that decided to open it up. A.K.A, us.

I was no expert on the supernatural, or even God for that matter, but I was certain there would be a means for us mortals to counter them. It just needed to be discovered first.

Despite their orders, most of the security personnel were actually quite easy going, and allowed for Mia and I to exchange hand written notes. She had been the first to send one, and it was such a relief when I read it and learned she was unharmed. My heart swelled with the knowledge that she had been the one to take the initiative to ask the guard to allow the exchange. The thought had not once crossed my mind.

I replied with an update on my own wellbeing, followed by a bit of a chiding for her initial interruption when I was about to tell Suffian the fabricated story we had been working on. I stressed that I loved her, but was certain that if she had not done what she did, perhaps Naeem may still be alive. It wasn’t till the next day when I received her answer:

*“Delusion drove Naeem during those last days of his life. If we revealed the fabricated account, it would have changed nothing. Suffian would not have been happy with that and we would have been searched soon after. They would have found the true translation, and you can imagine what would have happened to all of us as a result.*

*Though, I say all this now, but at the time that was far from what compelled me to intervene. I did it for you, Corey. Words cannot describe how much I love you, and the thought of you lying and compromising your very life, tore my heart in two. I will do anything for you. If there is a pathway that would see us both out of this place, spared from both Suffian, and the coming potential wrath of the Spirits, know that I have every intention of spending the rest of my life with you. That is, if you’d be happy to?”*

Fuck yes, I was.

Finally, forty days later, the door to my accommodation swung open, and Suffian entered. He was accompanied by Hamza, Milad and to my upmost joy, Mia. Her beautiful smile made my heart melt.

 I was about to charge towards her and bury her in my arms when Hamza stepped forward and pushed me back.

“This is a professional meeting, foreigner, not a reunion party,” Suffian said in a condescending manner. “Keep your emotions towards the woman restrained, for we have come after achieving a major milestone in the excavations of the tomb and will be needing to recommence your services very soon.”

I looked at Mia, eyes wide at this new development but she merely shrugged.

My chest began to tighten as I asked Suffian, “Has the tomb been unearthed?”

Suffian gestured for Milad to fill me in.

“Nearly. After breaking through the marble slab, we reached the original seal.” Milad said this with clear reluctance. I knew Milad would be crying inside for having been ordered to destroy the beautiful hand marked wall. It was simply a violation to his very responsibility as an Archaeologist, that being to preserve. “The first drill has finally entered the void behind the original seal, having bored for about half a meter. There is more drilling taking place as we speak. They should have the integrity of the rock compromised enough to be broken down and removed for a human to enter. I believe this can be achieved within the week.”

So now the fun begins, I thought.

“You and Mia are to be present when we enter the tomb for the first time,” Suffian said, before turning to Hamza and chuckling. “If there are Spirits in there at least they’ll get to meet two who believed in their existence.”

I shuddered at the thought.

That was literally all that Suffian had to tell me, and left with a spring in his step. In a way I hoped that the Spirits existed and meant to bring us harm. At least they could unleash their wrath on that arrogant man.

Milad and Mia remained and we continued to be filled in by the head Archaeologist on some of the finds they had already made. Hamza watched over us, but allowed Mia to be next to me, where we held hands tightly as we listened to Milad.

What was at first thought to be some discolouration on the surface of the original seal, turned out to be ancient dried up blood. It was predominantly smeared about on one side of the stone, and upon closer examination, contained multiple fingerprints. It was evident that there were at least nineteen individuals who had been present, touching the stone for whatever reason, with either bleeding, or bloody hands.

I recalled from the text that the tomb had been opened twice, maybe three times. The first being to place the bodies of the children and the Thugs within, the second when all the events towards the end of the text took place.

“Did you read the translation?” I asked Milad.

He sighed. “I have,” he then lowered his voice so that it was little more than a whisper, “And yes, I do believe what it says, even though nothing unnatural has happened since the drill pierced into it.”

“Yet,” I said.

He nodded reluctantly. “May Allah forgive me for defying Him.”

“Would you say these bloody hand prints line up with the text?”

Mia spoke up. “Well, isn’t it obvious! The fingerprints are situated predominantly on one side of the large stone. Most likely candidate? The men who had killed the children and rolled the stone in place the first time.”

“Or the soldiers who slew the thugs,” I added. “They somehow seem to be forgotten.”

Milad’s face turned pale. “I think there is a reason they were forgotten. Because they were not the ones who killed the thugs. The blood came from the thugs hands as they opened the tomb to place the bodies within… but I don’t think they ever saw the light of day after that.”

“So, what are you saying? Herod and Antipater alone killed them?”

Milad whispered again. “The children did.”

I felt my chest tighten and a chill run down my spine. It was an absurd notion, but somehow, I knew it to be the truth. Mia’s grip on my hand tightened further.

Hamza was momentarily distracted by one of his subordinates. I jumped at the brief window of opportunity. “Listen,” I whispered urgently, “there must be a way we can counter these Spirits if God is not able to intervene.”

“Intervene!” Milad said, aghast, “Corey, we are disobeying Allah, which means His back will be turned on us. If there is to be any sort of counter, then let it be Allah’s forgiveness. Though, at this point, I fear not even grovelling in Mecca will get His attention.”

In the end, I knew Milad spoke true. We were the ones not heeding the warning; therefore, we were destined to suffer for our ignorance.

Hamza came back and ordered Mia and Milad to accompany him back out. Before she could leave my side, I kissed her passionately on the lips, knowing it would be the last time we could do so before entering the tomb. There was a high chance it was our last kiss.

As I hugged her, I whispered into her ear. “When we enter it, no matter what happens, stay by my side. Fuck, Suffian. If the Spirits are to torment us, then together we will endure it.”

She pulled away, smiling through her glassy eyes, “makes a great synopsis for a tragic romance. Two star crossed lovers, forced to enter a cursed tomb against their will, refusing to leave each-others side as they are tormented by evil spirits for eternity.”

I wish I could disagree with her, but knew I’d only be lying.

Hamza pulled her away, and once again I was left alone.

For the next four days I felt like an inmate on death row as I awaited the call to enter the tomb that none of us were meant to.
