This is a story my mom recently shared with me. I had always known about how she had survived a traumatic event as a teenager, but it was one of those things that you never know how to start the conversation on. It was like a fourth person living in our house, that everyone tried not to look at.

But finally a few weeks ago, she sat me down at the dinner table. She told me that she thinks I'm old enough and it's finally time I heard what happened. That she finally believed I could handle it. And maybe I can't and that's why I'm typing this for you all to read. Maybe I just want to share my mom's story. I don't know. Whatever, here it is





If you ever need a clear sign to not go to a place, a man jumping in front of your car is a pretty clear cut sign.

It was June 5th 1985, I had just graduated high school and to earn a little more cash before I went off to college, I took a counselor position at a new summer camp that was starting up this year. I had had a job at the local theater as a ticket seller but the theater had been shut down for maintenance, so I found myself without that security this summer. I think my parents were friends with the owners of the camp because they signed me up for it. I probably could’ve just waited for the theater to reopen but my parents were the type that liked me to constantly be working on something. Homework, jobs, anything. Part of me knew that they just wanted me to build a good work ethic like they had. My mom was one of the top real estate agents in the state, and my dad was a Chinese immigrant and town mechanic who worked long hard hours. They had both worked to be as successful as they were and wanted a daughter who would continue on their path. 



But another part of me felt like they just didn’t want to have to care about their daughter. That they liked to shove me off on some other tasks so they could focus on their careers. I wrestled with even going to this summer job, but I finally resolved that money was money and It would do me good to spend some time outdoors.



I packed my car, kissed my mom goodbye and set off relatively early that morning as the camp was at Willowspeak, a lake up in the mountains about 5 and a half hours away from our town, and I wanted to be there before the sunset, at least. I heard it was a beautiful scenic location, but for whatever reason, no one in town ever really went there. I had thought it was the distance, but when I brought up that I was going to be spending the summer there, a lot of people seemed to stiffen up and get an odd look to them. One old man even said “good luck with that”.



I had been driving for almost 5 straight hours, only breaking for lunch and some snacks. After a while, on the outside of town, the route just became the same stretch of road. Asphalt surrounded by thick woods, with no signs of life anywhere. Due to the lack of mostly everything, I decided that it would be fine to take my eyes off the road for just a second. I was dying of thirst and I needed my water bottle. So I looked over and snatched it off the passenger's seat. As I returned my eyes to the road, a figure jumped into the way of my car.



“SHIT!” I yelled out and swerved to avoid them. I slammed on the brakes hard and the car came screeching to a halt, lucky staying on the road and not going into the treeline. The seatbelt dug into my chest and I almost slammed my head hard into the steering wheel. I sat in fear, only able to process my racing heart. I forced myself to take  some deep breaths trying to calm myself when I made the mistake of looking into my rear view mirror. The figure was just laying in the road. From my distance, I couldn’t see if they were injured, much less breathing.



I immediately felt my heart speed up again. Cursing loudly, I tore off my seatbelt, jumped out of the car and ran to the man. As I got closer, I could see that they were breathing and there were no major injuries on them, at least none I could see. Relieved that this person wasn’t bleeding out, I made my way so I was standing above them. It was an older man, probably in his 60s.  He was wearing a dirty t-shirt with holes in it and tattered brown pants. A few feet away laid some type of sun hat. He was balding and had a raggedy beard.The clear dirt on him and the fact that he could still have an internal injury made me not want to touch him, but I knew I needed to wake him up somehow.



“Sir?” I said loudly. He didn’t move. “Sir, are you alright? I’m really sorry I didn’t see-”



The man suddenly shot up, sitting bolt upright. He grabbed the collar of my shirt, ignoring my shout he pulled me to him and spoke in a deep gruff voice.



“She walks there each night! By the time you see her veil your miserable life will be over! Doomed! You’re dooming yourself to a miserable fate.”



With that, he let go. He began walking off muttering the same thing to himself. I took the opportunity and ran off to my car. I jumped in the driver's seat and started it up, praying that I hadn’t damaged it when I careened to a stop earlier. Lucky It started up smooth as ever and I floored it. not even bothering to buckle my seat belt. I didn’t want to be on this quiet road with that lunatic anymore. As I sped away, I looked in my rear view mirror and saw the man, now standing in the middle of the road, waving at me. I could still see him waving even as he became a small blot in my rearview mirror.
