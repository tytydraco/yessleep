*Through my research, I have come into contact with many. One friend I have begun to correspond with has shared a story, which I now pass on to you. I am working to help him, and I think I may have some answers soon.*

Grandma was loving and caring, but she was also a very stern woman. There was a right way and a wrong way to do things, and heaven help you if she caught you doing things the wrong way.

Still, she loved all her children and grandchildren. The times in my childhood where we got to visit her and play at her house are among some of my fondest memories.

Looking back, I don't recall anything strange or odd about her house. She didn't have any sort of dark side or occult knicknacks. No strange neighbors either.

She was very interested in genealogy though. There were all sorts of stories about different ancestors she found and would share with the family.

It wasn't until I was older that I really began to appreciate her hobby. It's fascinating to me now to learn about my heritage, where I come from, and the stories from the past.

I think that's what eventually led to my problem now, though. I'll explain.

I'm not sure when my issues with sleep started exactly. As a kid, it was never a problem, but around my teenage years, I began to have trouble sleeping. Bouts of insomnia, problems breathing, the occasional nightmare.

There was nothing consistent enough to raise a red flag. It was only in this last year that things took a turn. I began to have the same nightmare. I can't ever remember the details, but the thing I do remember is a mouth.

There are no other parts to it, just a pair of discolored lips, stretched over gray teeth and black gums. Too many teeth were in that mouth. It makes my stomach turn just thinking about it.

In the dream, it speaks to me. I don't remember what it says, but I know it scares me. The mouth moves closer, growing larger. It smiles and sings to me.

The song makes me shiver, but at the same time, something about it makes my heart ache. I want it to stop, but at the same time I want it to continue. I dread the end of the song.

That's all I can recall. The thing is that I keep having this same dream, with increasing frequency. As I began to consider it though, the dream felt way more familiar than it should.

If you're wondering how this is connected to my grandmother, I can explain now. When she passed away, she left behind a ton of family history. News articles, documents, journals.

I've been going through the papers for a while now, and today I came across something that grabbed my attention. I think it is a journal entry, I'm not sure yet. I'll write it here for you:

>I put down pen to paper, to warn my children, grandchildren, and those who Kome after about a great danger.

>**The One That Consumes- The Mouth.**

>This being hAs followed our family line for many generations, and I expect it will continue to do so until the coming of our Lord. It is a wiCked thing.

>I've searcHed for a means to undo its hold, but it seems that at most, all I can do is delay it. MethInks it is a demon, for what cause and purpose it has chosen us, I cannot claim to know. Its aims and goals are a yet mystery to me.

>Despite my iNhibitions, I've found a means to defend against it through a strAnge, childish practice that I've adapted from our native ancestral line. I write now that my descendents may find this and have hope. At all costs, you must protect yourselves. Seek for the answer.

>The mouth may be seen, but beware the eyes that are hidden, watching.

>Pipk bue iwyo fhohf

Reading this was like a flash of lightning in a storm. I began to remember dreams of the mouth, dreams that I had when I was much younger. I remembered dreams where the mouth was present all through my teen years. It never spoke, was never the center of my dreams, but it was always there.

I'm going to try and figure out who wrote this journal page, and if there are any more. Maybe I can find what that last line meant. If any of you have ideas, perhaps you can help me? The warning on the page... it unsettles me. I can almost feel the voice speaking, I can feel the worry, the fear.

With luck, I will be able to update you with more answers.
