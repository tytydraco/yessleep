I FUCKING LOVE Family Guy. I’ve bought all the merch, DVDs, video games, and have watched most of the seasons, So when I heard that the comedic genius known as Seth MacFarlane was working on a new show called American Dad, I nearly lost my shit. You bet your ass that I was waiting at the first premier at the edge of my seat.   
I watched the TV with anticipation like there was a nuclear apocalypse and it was the first broadcast from the US Government in weeks. It was about to come on when, all of the sudden, it cut to a screen that said: “TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES PLEASE WAIT”. I was fucking pissed. I waited for so long for this show’s premiere, and now it’s been ripped away from me.  
 Now the only thing I could do was wait for the repair people to fix it. Every second that message stayed on the screen, another piece of my soul broke, knowing I was missing a moment in TV animation history. After a few agonizing minutes, it finally cut back to the episode, although it was already half way through. I was kinda disappointed, but I just decided to watch it anyway. The show was pretty funny, and I liked the characters and story, but near the end of the episode, the screen became black and white.  
 I jostled my TV around, thinking it was busted, but the TV then suddenly cut to static. I’d pretty much had enough now, they can’t air one episode without it turning into a shitshow? Were they broadcasting this thing off the fucking Sputnik Satellite? I turned away from the TV and went to grab my phone from the table to call the broadcasting company to complain to them. (I used to work there, so I knew the number)   
But as I was dialing in the number on my Blackberry phone, I heard a strange sound coming from the TV. It sounded like someone dragging a heavy burlap sack behind them. And when I turned back to the TV, I realized that it was live footage taken from a camera, and it showed a first person view of someone walking through the forest with labored movement, like they were dragging something heavy.  
 Eventually they came to a bridge that was over a river, and they tossed a giant sack under the bridge. The TV cut to static again, and it showed a grainy black and white picture of a woman with text below saying:    VICTORIA  FRANKLIN 1978-1994  
After a few seconds, the TV cut to static once again for a few seconds, after which it cut back to the regular program.  
Ever since then, I’ve been freaked the fuck out. I’ve been having dreams where I was inside the sack that the person carried. I could feel pain when I was being dragged across branches and rocks, and when I would be thrown under the bridge. There were holes in the sack, but it was so dark that I still couldn’t distinguish any facial features, But I could see that they were wearing camouflage.  
That’s all the information I have about this incident for now, I'll update you if anything else happens.
