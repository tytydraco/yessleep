I heard the automatic doors of the hospital close behind me as I walked out into a beautiful albeit chilly fall afternoon, despite the beauty of the small town around me, internally I was screaming. In stark contrast to what I had just witnessed, what I had just done. It was magnificent outside.

I would have loved to go on walk today under different circumstances I thought to myself, as my body carried me down the street before making a sudden stop, pausing for a moment before turning and smoothly piloting me into our local video store. Thankfully almost nobody ever goes into the video store, I thought to myself as I heard the door swing closed behind me.

My body dragged me in tow as it glided down the aisle of comedy movies. I made my way through each aisle, and to my relief, I didn't see anyone. Unfortunately that relief would inevitably run out. As I cleared the last aisle and my body made its way passed the seemingly abandoned checkout counter, I was about to thank God for allowing me to leave the situation peacefully.

Thankfully I didn’t, as I heard the sound of heavy boxes hit the floor, my body swerved inhumanly quickly to survey the scene, and to my horror, who stood before me only 10 paces away, was the kind old video store owner, a second-generation immigrant from Taured.

I begged my body to leave the store, but my pleas were unheard, and if not unheard purposefully ignored by the Ai integrated pathway that connected my enhanced limbs and muscles to my brain. Despite my protests, and begging, my body purposefully walked toward her as she turned back to her boxes.

Her comfortability with me betrayed her almost as much as it broke my heart as I heard her ask, “Peter, would you mind helping me put these new movies out? I’ll let you pick a cand-!” Her words were cut short as my arms wrapped around her neck and squeezed until I felt a sickening crack.

If I could have made a sound, I can only imagine what kind of tormented cry would have come from my body if i could have made a sound at all, as i stood up and looked down at her broken form and the roaring of terror that flooded my mind became momentary louder than my own thoughts.

I wanted to leave, to stop seeing her but my body did something i couldn't understand, something that felt deeply wrong as my hand went flat and lifted itself to my forehead like a salute. My bout of near insanity inducing terror, and grief was momentarily replaced by a cold confusion.

My body walked past the empty checkout, through the door back onto the street. The first thing I saw when i walked out was the best and only bakery in town, and to my horror, it looked like they were really busy today based off all the cars in the parking lot. As I stepped out into the street towards the bakery, I silently prayed that someone would hit me with their car.

No such luck came, While I might have been referred to as Polite Peter in the past, nobody has ever called me LUCKY Peter, and after the day I've had, I wouldn't be surprised if the polite peter nickname is permanently retired.

I saw a man smoking a cigarette outside the restaurant, he was wearing a wife beater shirt with a tattoo of an American flag that had a Qr code overlaid on it in the shape of an M and an I.

I was terrified by what I might do to him as I approached the entrance but to my surprise my hands were as interested in him as he was in the cigarette he flicked into the parking lot as I walked by.

As I made my way into the bakery, I was greeted with a smell that reminded me of every birthday cake I’d ever had. (Which makes sense, it is the greatest bakery in town.) The smell and the memories associated could only ever be soured by what happens next.

I stood for a moment scanning the environment, I saw at least 7 people enjoying their food at tables.  I saw my uncle James, at the counter and of course behind the counter stood, the kindest woman in town. The owner of the bakery, who most of the people knew as Grandma Jay.

Grandma Jay is the towns largest foodbank donator and has such a charitable spirit that she often leaves a tray of samples on the counter for free. Despite how sweet she was, what I did to her, and those people next including my own uncle, was anything but sweet and will haunt me for the rest of my life.

My body didn't launch into an assault, it methodically walked slowly past the counter and slyly picked up a small set of keys that sat on the table next to my uncle, I recognized it immediately as the key to his bike lock. “I’m here to steal his bike!?!” I wondered in pure confusion.

Confusion that would very quickly melt into overt horror. As i walked out to the parking lot and toward his bike, I had no idea what my body’s intentions were. I realized soon that it was NOT his bike I was after at all. I bent over and slid the key into his bike lock and in one motion turned the key as I removed the lock from the bike. It was a thick metal bike lock that I had gotten him for Christmas, after his last bike was stolen from his front yard.

My body stood up and studied the lock before nodding. I was thrown off by this as I made my way back toward the bakery. That is until I saw the door. I’d looked it hundreds of times before but as I looked up at it, I felt a sense of building dread.  I realized what the bike lock was for.

I glided to the door and felt my hands adjusting the bike lock, I watched as the bike lock slid perfectly through the handles of the door, before I felt my hand twist and heard the cold click of the lock closing. I knew it was going to be bad, but I had no clue what was about to happen when I turned around and walked down the street.

Each step away from the bakery made less and less sense, my body was scanning my surroundings wildly and I had no clue why. That is until i suddenly stopped walking. My head stopped scanning, my body changed position to match and I smoothly walked towards what is likely the worst thing my body could have possibly found, A jerrycan full of gasoline.

“No!” I thought seemingly out of habit as this point as my body made its way back towards the bakery. As i started to douse the outside of the bakery with gasoline, I silently condemned myself for watering Grandma Jay's plants so often.

If it wasn't so normal to see me out there with a watering can the people inside might have had a chance to realize that something was wrong and call help or at the least escape, However when grandma Jay looked up and saw me through the window she gave a friendly wave, I could feel in my heart that she completely unaware. I screamed at them to warn them, through excruciating silence but as if I was locked behind a one-way mirror, they couldn't see anything but their perception of me, a reflection of themselves.

I watched in horror as I shoved my hand into my pocket, I knew what it was the second I touched it. I pulled out the lighter my father had given me for my sixteenth birthday, before dropping it into a puddle of gasoline. I watched as the fire danced all the way around the store. My body stood locked in place as I watched the fire climb until presumably people inside noticed, at which point I heard the first thud.

I heard several stronger thuds, I'm pretty sure they were working together, I was transfixed but unable to assist. I only hope they didn't see me standing silently out there between the first thud and the time it took for the thuds to slow down and ultimately stop.

A few moments after the thuds stopped, when the only sound other than my crying inner voice was the roar of flames consuming the bakery that moments before served as a social hub and warm hearth for our community. The sound of their screams will likely be the background music of my almost guaranteed sentence in hell.

If i had any say over my actions at this point, I would have walked into the fire, but unfortunately for me, and my small community that wasn't on the table. In contrast to the despair, grief, and immense regret that wounded my mind, and weighed down my soul, my body was far from done as I turned away and from the burning bakery and walked down the street.

The casual way my body walked down the street made me sick, I knew in my heart that I could never do those things, let alone walk away as if nothing had happened at all. Yet here I was as I watched through stinging eyes my body rhythmically marched forward in indifference.

The walking went on for quite some time, and I was really appreciative for the break from the intense dread, and fear, even if it was short lived, because as calming as the walk was for my frayed nerves, The fear and dread came back tenfold when I stopped walking, and I smelled something I recognized. I Knew this part of town. Immediately my heart sank, before I even looked up i knew where I was from the smell alone. I stood poised in an aggressive position as I stared across the street at my best friend's bar, and judging from the cars in the parking lot, all of my closest buddies were drinking inside.
