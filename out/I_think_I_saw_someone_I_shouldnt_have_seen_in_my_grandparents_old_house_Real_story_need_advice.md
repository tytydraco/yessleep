Hello, everyone. This story is translated from my native language. I want to share something strange that happened to me recently, and I’m not sure how to take it. Please take this post seriously. Last weekend, I went to my grandparents’ old house in the countryside near Cluj, a place I hadn’t visited in years. This house is the kind of place that, as a child, everything seems a bit eerie—flickering lights, creaky floors at night, that cold air coming from the basement. Things that might seem normal now but used to give me chills back then.

So, after all this time, I decided to go there to do some cleaning and go through their belongings. By evening, when it was already getting dark and the atmosphere had turned quite gloomy, I started hearing footsteps coming from the attic. At first, I thought I was imagining things, maybe it was a bird, a rat, or something. But the sounds were clear and very much like heavy footsteps, as if someone was slowly coming down the stairs.

I got up to check, but as I approached the stairs, the sounds suddenly stopped. I looked up the stairs and saw nothing, just darkness. Anyway, I thought to myself that I was tired and my mind was playing tricks on me.

I continued with my tasks and found a box of old stuff—photos, letters, things that belonged to my grandparents. In the box, there was also a photo album I hadn’t seen before. Out of curiosity, I started flipping through the pages. At some point, I came across a photo of a tall man in an old-fashioned suit, standing next to a window. Nothing special, except that… in the background, through the window, you could clearly see my grandparents’ house, exactly as it looks now, but with a shadowy, blurred figure in the window, as if someone was watching from inside.

I don’t know why, but a cold shiver ran down my spine. It felt like the man in the photo had a gaze that pierced through me, as if he knew I was looking at him. I didn’t recognize anyone in the photo, and on the back, it simply said “1936.”

After trying not to think too much about it, I heard the footsteps again. This time, they were directly above me, on the attic floor. I had that horror movie scenario in my head—should I leave or “investigate”? I took my phone, turned on the flashlight, and went up the stairs. By the time I reached the top, the sounds had stopped again, but this time I felt that cold breeze again, which made me freeze in place. I poked my head up through the trapdoor, and in the far corner of the attic, hanging from a nail, was an old suit… with a hat! I was paralyzed. I had been up there earlier and swear I hadn’t seen it. I don’t know if it was the same as the one the man in the photo was wearing, but I didn’t stick around to check. Now curiosity is eating at me, and I’m thinking about going. What should I do? Could it be more than normal?
