I miss my Grandpa Ellis. I miss the way he’d hum old tunes while whittling wood on the back porch. I miss the smell of his pipe tobacco, a sweet, safe smell that meant stories and hard candies pulled from the pockets of his cardigan. The man who died in his study two weeks ago… that wasn’t him. Not really. 

They said it was a heart attack. Quick. Peaceful. Bullshit. 

I was the one who found him. The door to his study was locked from the inside, which mom thought was weird because he never locked it. I had to shoulder it open, the old wood splintering around the latch. 

He wasn't at his desk. He was crumpled on the floor in front of the big bay window, his body twisted like a discarded rag doll. One hand was clawed into the rug, the other was stretched out, fingers bloody and broken from trying to pry up the floorboards. His face… God, his face. His eyes were wide open, but they weren't the kind, tired eyes I knew. They were frozen in a pure, animal terror, the kind you see in a rabbit just before the hawk strikes. His mouth was stretched into a silent scream, and dried, rusty tear-tracks stained his cheeks. This wasn't a heart giving out. This was a soul being ripped from its housing. 

It was a week after the funeral, the smell of flowers and casseroles still clinging to the house, when I went back into the study. It felt wrong, like trespassing on a crime scene. I was just supposed to be boxing up books. But I found myself drawn to the old roll-top desk, his desk. The bottom drawer was stuck. I yanked it hard, and it screeched open, revealing a mess of old maps and faded photographs. And underneath it all, wrapped in an old, slick oilcloth, was a bundle. Tied with a piece of string that crumbled to dust when I touched it. On the outside, in his shaky handwriting, was my name. 

*For Sarah. So someone knows.* 

Inside were two journals. One was a small, green, military-looking notebook. The other was bigger, leather-bound, and falling apart. The smell that rose from them was unmistakable—jungle rot, damp earth, and something else, something sweet and sickly, like spoiled meat. 

I poured two fingers of his good bourbon, the one he saved for holidays, and sat in his worn leather chair. I opened the small, green journal. My grandfather’s voice, from when he was a young man, a private first class in a war I could only imagine, spilled out onto the page. This is what he wrote. This is what killed him. 

**Ellis's Journal - October 17, 1944** 

The jungle here doesn’t end. It just gets thicker and darker, like God forgot this place and something else moved in. We’ve been walking for days. The rain isn't rain; it's a cold, constant piss from the sky. Everything is wet. Your socks, your ammo, your soul. Leeches everywhere. Hicks just burns 'em off with a cigarette, doesn't even flinch. 

We were lost. Corrigan, our Lieutenant, a kid who still looks like he should be delivering newspapers, was trying to read a map from the Stone Age. 

"Bearings, Hicks?" Corrigan’s voice was tight. 

Hicks, a mountain of a man from Montana, spat a stream of brown tobacco juice. It vanished into the mud. "Compass is spinning, sir. Like a drunk at a county fair. This ground's no good." 

"We don't have better ground, Sergeant," Corrigan snapped, his patience gone. "We have this… this green hell. Miller! Point. Find me a vantage point. Anything." 

So I went. Pushing through vines that felt like cold, dead fingers. And then, the trees just… stopped. 

"Lieutenant," I whispered, holding up a fist. The line of tired, soaked men behind me halted. "You gotta see this." 

We stood at the edge of a razorback ridge, looking down into a deep valley. And in the bottom of it, nestled against a river the color of charcoal, was a town. 

It was all wrong. 

"Jesus," breathed Chipper, our radioman. He was all of nineteen, with freckles and a perpetual look of someone who'd just been slapped. "What is that?" 

"Not on the map," Corrigan said, stating the obvious. He folded the map with a sharp, frustrated motion. 

Hicks squinted, his eyes like chips of flint. "Nothing's ever just empty, Lieutenant. Especially not here. Place looks deader than my ex wife." 

A crack of thunder ripped the sky open, and the rain went from heavy to biblical. 

"Options, sir," Hicks said, his voice a low rumble. "We make a shelter here and get washed down the mountain, or we head down there and get a roof." 

Corrigan stared at the silent, grey town. I saw the war in his eyes—the officer vs. the scared, tired boy. The rain, ice-cold and relentless, made the decision for him. 

"Single file. Safeties off. Miller, you've got point. Everyone, stay sharp." 

The descent was a nightmare of mud and sliding on our asses. The closer we got, the quieter it became. Not peaceful quiet. The kind of quiet that feels like a held breath. The jungle sounds were just… gone. Replaced by the squelch of our boots and the drumming of rain on rusty, curled roof tiles. 

The main street was a river of mud, flanked by buildings that leaned in like gossips. The air stank. Wet rot, sure, but underneath it… God, it was like a butcher's shop in August. Sweet and putrid. 

"This place is spooky as hell," Chipper whispered, his knuckles white on his rifle. 

"Spooky don't mean shit, Chipman," Hicks growled without looking back. "A bullet from a spooky Jap will kill you just as dead. Shut up and watch your sector." 

The first building we entered looked like it had been a café. Iron tables and chairs were overturned, rusted into abstract sculptures. 

"Where is everyone?" I muttered. 

"No bodies," I said, louder. "No signs of a fight. It's like they all just… vanished mid-meal." 

Corrigan pushed open the double doors of a larger, two-story building. "We're securing this for the night. Hicks, two-man watch rotations. Miller, Chipman, sweep the ground floor. I don't want any surprises." 

Chipper and I moved through the rooms. A dining room, a table set for a meal that never happened. A study. Books in Latin. And on the desk, a large, leather-bound ledger. 

"Chipper, get the LT," I said. My throat was dry. 

When they came in, I just pointed at the book. Corrigan leaned over, his young face grim in the grey light. 

"It's in Latin," he said, tracing the writing with a finger. "Dates from the 1880s." He started reading, his voice dropping to a hush. 

*"October 12th… The silence is the worst. Three days since the last echo. Jean-Claude swears he heard his own voice come back to him from the gorge, but it was not his voice. It was a mockery. We have barred the doors. We do not speak above a whisper. The town does not like loud noises."* 

He flipped a page. His hand was shaking. 

*"October 14th. The Desrosiers family is gone. Not fled. Gone from their beds. Marthe claims the statues by the river move. We are all going mad. The offerings have not worked. The soil rejects the dead."* 

"Offerings? Statues?" Hicks cut in, his voice a low, dangerous thing. "Sir, with all due respect, this is ghost story nonsense." 

Corrigan ignored him, his eyes glued to the page. He read the last entry, his voice barely a whisper. 

*"October 17th. It is my fault. I thought the legends were superstition. The river is not a source of wealth. It is a throat. And we are the food. It is learning our voices. It learns, and then it… echoes. I can hear it now, scratching at the door. It has Pierre’s voice. It is asking to be let in. God forgive—*" 

The writing stopped. A huge, black blot of ink covered the rest of the page, as if the pen had been driven right through the paper. 

We stood there. The four of us, in that dusty, silent room, listening to the rain. None of us said a word. We didn't have to. The same cold, greasy fear was slithering into the gut of every man in that room. 

Something was in this town with us. And it knew we were here.
