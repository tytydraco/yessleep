I used to feel so at home on the ocean. I guess that’s not very surprising considering that I more or less grew up there. That’s one of the perks of being the son of a couple of marine biologists.

&#x200B;

I grew up in Malibu, California and I spent most of my time there out on the water with my parents. They loved being out at sea, whether it was for work or just for fun. I remember going out fishing with my Dad and watching with big fascinated eyes as he filled my head with little facts about the fish on the end of our line. I remember my Mom showing me pictures of tropical fish she’d taken during some of her trips abroad. Some nights, we’d walk along the beach together, listening to the soothing sounds of the ocean waves crashing to the coast… and just like he and my Mom did once upon a time, I fell in love with the sea. I used to make my own little books, about the giant imaginary sea monsters that lurked out in the depths. I had a whole series of them actually.

&#x200B;

THE BIG BAD SHARK.

&#x200B;

THE BIG BAD OCTOPUS.

&#x200B;

THE BIG BAD JELLYFISH.

&#x200B;

I was too young to actually write words in these books mind you. They were just crude drawings of sea monsters on a piece of paper folded a few times to resemble a book. I don't remember much about them other than the obvious. The Big Bad Shark could eat anything in the sea. The Big Bad Octopus fought pirates and The Big Bad Jellyfish was actually in space for some reason. Looking back, it all kinda sounds a little silly. But I still treasure those memories. 

&#x200B;

I don't imagine it was all that surprising  that I wanted to be a Marine Biologist just like my parents. Like I said before, I fell in love with the sea and I couldn't see myself devoting my life to anything else. I eventually narrowed my field of study to Marine Mammals and everything after that is more or less history. I put in the work and eventually I graduated from California State with honors. Within the year I was working alongside my Dad. He’d hired me on as an assistant researcher.

&#x200B;

Honestly, getting the chance to work alongside my Dad was a dream come true. At least, I’d thought it would be a dream come true… But here’s the thing. We never really know our parents, do we? Maybe we think we do, but we only know the part of them that they let us see. There’s always more lurking beneath the surface.

&#x200B;

When my Dad asked me if I wanted to join him on a one week field expedition to study a pod of orcas he’d been tracking just off the coast of Newfoundland, I couldn’t say no. I had been doing more work on my own away from my Dad at the time, but I still jumped at the chance to work with him again. Although I’ll be honest, I didn’t just agree to join him because I missed working with him. That *was* part of it, but it also wasn’t the whole story.

&#x200B;

About a year prior, my parents had separated. Neither of them ever told me exactly why. They both kinda seemed reluctant to discuss it so I didn’t pry and assumed I’d find out what had happened sooner or later. In the meanwhile, my Mom hadn’t said a single bad word about my Dad to me and likewise he hadn’t said anything about her. They’d both independently assured me that neither of them had cheated. In fact, the only thing they did say was that they were: ‘*Growing apart’*. They hadn’t filed for divorce yet, but they’d both told me they were discussing it. 

&#x200B;

Considering how I was in my late twenties at the time, I’d say I took the news of their separation pretty well. I wasn’t happy about it, but I could accept it. My parents on the other hand didn’t seem to adjust quite as quickly. Mom had retreated to the Caribbean to bury herself in work and Dad had done the same out in Newfoundland. I’d made a point to try and stay in touch with both of them, but neither of them seemed quite themselves anymore. Mom tried to make it sound like everything was okay, even though I knew it wasn’t. She asked about my Dad a lot, and I always told her the truth. I hadn’t heard much from him. Most of the time when I tried to call him, I’d just get his voicemail and on the rare occasions where he actually did call me back he never seemed to have a lot to say. Our conversations would be friendly, but brief before he’d inevitably excuse himself and hang up.

&#x200B;

 *“I’m just swamped out here. Barely even have time to sleep!”* He’d say. *“I’ll tell you all about it later!”*

Up until I got that invitation to join him though, I wasn’t entirely sure if there’d ever be a later. 

&#x200B;

I already knew that Mom wasn’t handling the separation that well. Something in my gut told me that Dad was handling it even worse. I was hoping that maybe some one on one time with him might do him some good. 

&#x200B;

I arrived in St. John’s during the second week of July and met my Dad at the airport. He and I grabbed lunch at a local place and I listened as he talked about the work he’d been doing over the past few months.

  “We’ve been tracking the activity of this one pod, moving north for the season. It’s been really fascinating stuff. We’ve been gathering some really fascinating data on their social structure and their hierarchy. It’s like seeing the world through their eyes!”

&#x200B;

  “It sounds pretty fascinating,” I said. “I can see why you’ve been focused on this.”

  “Well, I need something to keep me busy!” He said, chuckling. “Idle hands and all that.”

  “Yeah, well. I’m glad you found something. How’ve you been holding up otherwise?” I asked.

&#x200B;

Dad paused for a moment, but his smile didn’t fade at all.

  “I’m great,” he said. “I don’t hear from your Mom much, if that’s what you’re asking about. But that’s fine. I imagine she’s busy too.”

  “Yup. Last I spoke to her, she was in Bridgetown, visiting Grandma. She always asks about you, you know?”

  “Does she now?” Dad asked, although it was hard to read his tone, “Well you can tell her I’m doing just fine. I think I’ve finally found what I’m looking for.” 

&#x200B;

  “I’ll bet she’ll be happy to hear that,” I said.

  “Speaking of which… the expedition. We’ve moved the timetable up. We’ll be casting off on Friday, not Sunday,” He said. “We noticed some new movement in the pod, so we wanted to get as close as we can while they’re still in the area. That’s fine with you, right?”

  “Yeah, I’m ready to go whenever,” I said picking up a fry off my plate and popping it into my mouth, “You still working with Dr. Griffin and her team?”

  “Lily? Not this time,” he said. “It’s a much smaller crew. Most of them just handle the sailing. That’s part of why I called you in, actually. I could use an extra pair of hands out there.”

&#x200B;

I raised an eyebrow.

  “You’re not working with Dr. Griffin anymore?” I asked, genuinely surprised. My Dad and Lily Griffin had been working together for as long as I could remember. 

  “She’s back in Malibu. Took some time off to focus on teaching. Anyways, this is sort of a private project,” Dad admitted. “There’s no reason to call her in. We’re just going to collect some data from a few of the tagged whales and we’ll be back before you know it.”

&#x200B;

Something about the way that he said all of that didn’t sound right to me. It seemed… dismissive, somehow. Dad was still smiling at me like nothing was wrong though and I didn’t see any real reason not to trust him. I mean, I’d been around the man long enough to know that he knew his stuff. 

  “Alright, well… I’m happy to help.” I said.

  “Knew you would be,” Dad replied, before reaching across the table to clap me on the shoulder. The gesture seemed forced and despite his warm smile, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was very, very wrong here.

&#x200B;

Early Friday morning, I met Dad down at the marina to help get the boat ready to go. The moment I saw the boat we’d chartered I immediately found myself wondering just what the hell I’d just gotten myself into. Back when my Dad had worked with Dr. Griffin’s team, we’d spent our time at sea on a proper research boat. They were designed to carry out research at sea. The equipment was already there. Launching and retrieving boats was fairly simple. 

&#x200B;

What my Dad led me to that Friday morning was a fishing trawler with a faded baby blue hull. On the side was the name: ‘*The Seagull*’. It certainly looked surdy, but it would not have been my first choice for a research vessel. Hell, it wouldn’t even be my second or third choices. The equipment on board was more suited for fishing than research. We needed to bring the equipment ourselves. 

&#x200B;

I told myself that I was just spoiled by the bigger, nicer boats I’d worked on or if there was something off here. This was obviously a smaller operation and Dad was probably paying for it out of pocket, so it made sense that the boat wasn’t as nice. But something about this whole thing still seemed off to me. I just couldn’t quite put my finger on how.

&#x200B;

As we boarded with our equipment, the Captain, a stout, greying man with a bushy mustache who introduced himself as Leonard P. Scott  greeted me with a crushing handshake before making a quick introduction to the other two members of his crew; His first mate, a tall, rail thin man who was about as old as he was named Alexander Mitchell and his deckboss, a scrawny, balding and unkempt looking guy named Jimmy.

&#x200B;

  “Sooner we cast off, the better. We’ve got a long trip ahead of us,” Captain Scott had said as he’d watched my Dad and I set up.

  “How far out are we going?” I asked. Captain Scott just looked to Dad for the answer.

  “As far as we need to,” he said. “The spot where we’re expecting to be able to intercept the pod is about 200 nautical miles out.”

&#x200B;

  “Can this boat handle that?” I asked.

  “Easily,” Captain Scott replied. “Don’t underestimate this old girl. She’s reliable.”

  “I’ve worked with the Captain here a few times before,” Dad said. “Trust me Stephen, this boat will get the job done.”

I figured he probably knew what he was talking about. 

&#x200B;

We cast off shortly after dawn and as the boat went out, I watched the coastline fade into the distance. The churning waves crashed to the rocky shores, throwing up white seafoam as they did. Normally, the sight of the ocean set me at ease. But this time I just couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong here and the sight of the rocky Newfoundland coast falling away into the distance didn’t fill me with excitement but with a quiet, lingering unease. Like I was just waiting for something bad to happen, even though I didn’t quite know what, yet. That feeling stayed with me throughout our first day out at sea.

&#x200B;

Dad had set up a makeshift office down in the Trawlers engine room and I found him there shortly after noon, coffee mug in hand and tapping away at his laptop.

  “How’re you settling in?” I asked him. He barely even looked up from his computer screen as he responded.

  “Good, good. Just checking out the pods movements now… you wanna see?”

&#x200B;

He waved me over to take a look at his screen. There, I could see a crude map with about six little dots on it. I figured those must’ve been the whales.

  “That’s them, huh?” I asked.

  “Yup. Beautiful pod. Really beautiful. It’ll be exciting to see them again. I tagged them all last year to gather a little more data on their migration patterns. Sort of a little side project of mine.”

  “Find anything interesting?” I asked.

&#x200B;

Dad was silent although I thought I saw him cracking a smile before it quickly vanished.

  “Hard to say at this point,” he said. “I might’ve seen something interesting. We’ll have to look at the data once we’ve gotten closer.”

  “How exactly are you going to get the tags off the whales anyways?” I asked, “I thought they usually fell off naturally and you retrieved them later. Can’t imagine they’ll just stop and let you remove them.”

&#x200B;

  “Oh… this is sort of a new piece of tech I’m trying out for a colleague,” Dad said. “Downloads the data once you get close enough. Really fancy stuff.”

  “Really?” I asked, “Sounds fancy.”

  “Oh yeah, he’s been working on this for years. It’s half the reason why I’m out here. He’s been dying to try these things out!” Dad said, “Gives me something to do, right?”

  “Hey, no arguments here,” I said before noticing something on his desk. A scrap of paper that had been folded into quarters like a book. On the front was a crude pencil drawing of a jellyfish and in messy letters above it were the words: *BIG BAD.*

&#x200B;

I paused for a moment before reaching out to pick up the drawing.

  “No way, you’ve still got these?” I asked.

Dad looked over at it, before laughing.

  “Hey, can’t blame me for being sentimental, can you?” He asked, “I remember you loved making these. There was a shark, there was a giant squid, there was an orca whale… what else…”

&#x200B;

  “Jellyfish?” I offered before thumbing through the ‘pages’. Each one contained another crude drawing of the Big Bad Jellyfish with lines underneath where the text was supposed to go. It’d been years since I saw any of this and it brought fond memories rushing back.

&#x200B;

  “Man, I might just have to take this off your hands,” I said.

  “No you won’t,” Dad replied. “Those are mine, thank you very much. If I recall correctly, you gave them to me. They’re your first published texts. I was very proud.”

  “Yeah, a little light on the text, wasn’t I?” I asked.

  “You were six, I think that can be excused,” he said. His laptop beeped and we both looked over at it. One of the dots on the screen was flashing. It blinked a few times before disappearing outright.

&#x200B;

  “What was that?” I asked.

Dad stared at the screen for a moment, watching the five dots on it.

  “Calibration error,” he finally said before looking back at me with a smile. “Nothing to worry about. New tech is kinda wonky, that’s all.”

  “Yeah? Make a log of it, let your friend know,” I said. 

  “Will do,” he said, reaching for a small notebook he had and opening it up. He scribbled something down inside.

&#x200B;

  “Anyways, Captain Scott says we’ll be having lunch soon. He sent me down here to grab you.”

  “Oh, I’m not hungry,” Dad said. “I’ll eat later. Still got a bit of work to do down here.”

  “You sure?” I asked.

  “Positive. Go on. And don’t worry. Jimmy’s a damn good cook.”

I hesitated for a moment before deciding there wasn’t any point in pushing him.

  “Alright, see you topside, then,” I said before letting him get back to work.

&#x200B;

The first day aboard the The Seagull was fairly quiet, outside of my brief conversation with my Dad. I can’t say it was that unpleasant though. I spent a lot of my time in the mess hall, reading a book to pass the time. During the evening, I joined Captain Scott and Jimmy for a game of cards. We invited Dad, but he chose to stay down in the engine room. 

  “Still got a few things to take care of!” He’d said, “I’ll be up later.”

He wasn’t.

&#x200B;

I went down to talk with him a few more times during the day but those conversations weren’t particularly fruitful. He kept saying: ‘I’ll be up later.’ although as far as I could tell, the only times he ever left the engine room was when he went to the bathroom or when he went to sleep. I ended up bringing him all of his meals, and every time I saw him he was hunched over that laptop, watching the progress of the whales. 

&#x200B;

The next day, Dad only spent the morning down in the engine room. Closer to noon, he’d brought that laptop of his topside to the wheelhouse where he used the tracking to try and help Mitchell zero in on the whales. I’d asked if there was anything I could do to help out, but Dad had barely even given me a proper response.

&#x200B;

  “Just keep an eye out. We’re close now. She’s not far,” was all he said to me.

I’d figured he was just excited and left him to steer while I stayed topside with Jimmy. We deployed the hydrophone we’d brought on board to help listen in for any whale calls before scanning the horizon for some sign of the pod. 

&#x200B;

It was past one when I finally saw it and the moment I was sure I was looking at a pod of orcas, I went right up to the wheelhouse.

  “Dad, I think I see them!”

  “Where?” he asked, tearing out of the wheelhouse and snatching my binoculars away. He scanned the horizon with them, before finally spotting the pod for himself. His lips curled into a knowing grin.

&#x200B;

  “That’s them…” he said,  before going back inside to guide Mitchell closer. 

“Should we prepare a dinghy?” I asked, “See if we can’t get a little closer?”

  “No need, let’s keep our distance for now,” Dad replied. “I just want to watch.”

  “Watch what?” I asked although he didn’t respond.

I took my binoculars back, left the wheelhouse and headed back down to the deck to take another look at the whales.

&#x200B;

As I leaned against the railing, I couldn’t help but notice just how erratic their movements were. They were moving fast and close to the surface. At first, I wondered if they might’ve been hunting something, but that didn’t seem right. Orcas hunt using coordinated techniques. These whales were packed in close together and all swimming in one uniform direction. They weren’t hunting.

&#x200B;

I studied them for a moment longer before heading back to the wheelhouse.

  “Where’s the hydrophone?” I asked, “Did we turn it on?”

  “Yeah, we’re getting the feedback from it,” Dad said.

  “Where?”

&#x200B;

Dad fidgeted with his laptop for a moment before turning the volume up. I could hear the sounds of the water around us, indicating that the hydrophone was on. But there was no sound at all, not from the pod at least.

  “Why aren’t they making any noise?” I asked, looking over at Dad.

  “Could be we’re just not close enough,” he said.

  “We’re less than a mile out. We should be able to hear them,” I said before going for my binoculars again. I looked out at the distant pod, trying to figure out just what was going on.

&#x200B;

Then it hit me. 

&#x200B;

I’d only ever heard of a few cases where orcas had gone silent before. In that instance, the orcas had been trying to avoid attracting the attention of some nearby pilot whales. While I was pretty sure there weren’t any pilot whales in the area since we would’ve heard them, it still got me wondering.

&#x200B;

Were these whales being hunted?

&#x200B;

  “Can you check for any other frequencies on the hydrophone?” I asked, “Are we picking anything else up?”

  “Let me see…” Dad murmured, opening up a program and tapping away at it, “Let’s try this…”

&#x200B;

The moment those words left his mouth, a new sound came out of the speakers. A low but loud droning sound that filled the entire cabin. For a moment, I thought it was some sort of background noise but there was more to it than that. Buried in the noise were faint clicks, like the kind a whale makes although these clicks didn’t sound like anything I’d ever heard before… 

&#x200B;

Dad stared at the laptop screen in awe, his eyes slowly lighting up as he listened to the surreal noise that filled the cabin. Beside us, Mitchell just stared as well although his expression was considerably less awed.

  “What the hell is that?” He asked quietly.

  “It’s Her…” was Dad’s only reply.

&#x200B;

One of the machines near the front of the wheelhouse pinged and Mitchell ran to it.

  “Something just popped up on our radar,” he said. “Something big.”

  “Dad, what the hell is going on out there?” I asked but he was already heading down to the deck a handheld camcorder clutched in his hands.

  “Dad?” I called again, “Dad, what the hell is out there?”

&#x200B;

He ran to the railing, watching the distant pod closely before raising his camera to start filming. I could still hear that awful droning sound coming out of the cabin and it was starting to make my head hurt.

  “Watch…” That was all that my Dad said to me. “Just watch.”

&#x200B;

A moment later, the boat rocked violently beneath us. Dad barely even flinched. I raised my binoculars to look but didn’t see anything different with the water… not at first, anyway. The pod of whales was getting further away from us. Their movements seemed more frantic and panicked than before.

&#x200B;

Then…

&#x200B;

There was a spray of seafoam and a flash of crimson. I thought I saw something underneath all of that but I couldn’t be sure.

  “THERE YOU ARE!” Dad cried, although I wasn’t sure if he saw much more than I did. As the water settled, the whales kept swimming, although I counted one less member of the pod now. Something had dragged it under and I didn’t want to imagine just what that thing could have possibly been!

&#x200B;

Dad kept filming, looking around frantically for another trace of whatever the hell we’d just seen out there. 

  “Come on baby, don’t go under just yet…” he murmured before hastily passing the camera to me.

  “No matter what, don’t stop filming!” He said before running back up to the wheelhouse.

&#x200B;

I hesitated for a moment before following him.

  “Dad, what the hell is going on here?” I asked although just like the previous few times I’d asked that question, it fell on deaf ears. 

  “Come on, come on, come on…” He murmured, before looking at me, “Get back out there! We can’t miss her!”

  “Miss who?! Dad, what did we just see out there?”

He looked over at Mitchell who was still by the radar.

  “Is she still here?” He asked frantically.

Mitchell was silent for a moment before looking back at my Dad.

&#x200B;

  “Radar’s clear…” he said softly.

  “DAMNIT. Fine… we keep following the pod then. She’ll get hungry again. Likely by tomorrow or the day after. We’ll get some better footage then.”

  “Footage of *what!*” I snapped and when Dad ignored me, I slammed his laptop closed.

  “Footage of what?” I repeated.

&#x200B;

Dad stared at me before opening his mouth to begin to argue. He paused when he saw Captain Scott coming into the wheelhouse and staring daggers at him.

  “Don’t lie to the boy, Frank,” Captain Scott said. “We both know damn well that you didn’t come out here to study whales, did you?”

&#x200B;

Dad was silent for a moment, staring between me, Mitchell and Captain Scott. Finally he laughed.

  “Alright…” he said, putting his hands up, “You got me. But I wasn’t lying about tracking the whales. That part was true! You were there, Captain! You saw me tag them!”

  “Yes, I did,” Captain Scott replied, his voice calm but bitter. “And up until now I’ve never had any reason to question your purpose. Up until now. You were tracking the whales but you were looking for something else, weren’t you?. What’s out there, Dr. Barry. My crew and I deserve to know. *Your son* deserves to know!”

&#x200B;

Dad just smiled sheepishly.

  “Would you believe I don’t entirely know?” He asked, “I’ve read some things… heard about a few other people who’ve seen it. But I honestly don’t know what exactly it is. That’s why we’re out here. I want to change that. Study it firsthand.”

  “You knew it was hunting the whales?” I asked.

  “I had a theory. Dr. Griffin noticed that she’d lost a few specimens in these waters. I started tracking the whales out here about four years ago to see if I could figure out why. Now, I know the answer.”

&#x200B;

  “You son of a bitch…” Captain Scott growled, “You hired us to help you tag whales. *That* is what we agreed to! Not hunting some kind of unknown predator in the middle of the ocean!”

  “With all due respect Captain, I don’t think it poses any danger to us! Hell, I don’t even think it’s really a predator!”

  “We just watched that thing drag a killer whale to its death, if that’s not a predator than what the hell is it?” Captain Scott asked.

&#x200B;

Dad hesitated for a moment.

  “It would be easier to explain if I had the texts with me…” he started although the thud of Captain Scott’s fist on the table silenced him.

  “What is out there Dr. Barry?” He demanded.

&#x200B;

Again Dad paused, taking a moment to gather himself.

  “I think it’s a God,” he finally said. “Or at least, something that people believed to be some kind of primordial deity. You find it mostly in Icelandic and some Norse mythology, although there were some similar entities in cultures all around the world. So far the earliest name I’ve heard attributed to it is ‘*Omylia*’ but-”

  “I’m sorry, you think that thing we just saw is some sort of God?” Captain Scott asked.

  “Look, I understand that I may have misled you…” Dad said, “But I can assure you that the risk to yourself and your crew is minimal! So long as we keep a respectful distance we’ll be fine!”

&#x200B;

Captain Scott just scoffed.

  “Mitchell,” he said, “Turn us around. Bring us back to St. John’s.”

  “Wait, back?” Dad asked, “Leonard we can’t go back! We’re not done here!”

&#x200B;

He reached out to put a hand on Captain Scott’s shoulder, only to be met with a fist to his face that knocked him flat on his ass. He was out cold the moment he hit the ground.

  “Can someone escort Dr. Barry down to the crews quarters?” the Captain asked, “And ask Jimmy to make sure he doesn’t leave.” 

&#x200B;

I stared down at my unconscious father before helping him to his feet. His head lolled to the side. I heard him mutter something under his breath as he started to come back to it. I didn’t say a word to him, I just dragged him out of the wheelhouse and down to the cabins.

&#x200B;

After Dad was left to ‘rest’ in his cabin, I grabbed his laptop and brought it back down to his office in the engine room. I don’t really know what I was hoping to find, but after the things he’d said up in the wheelhouse, I wanted to look through his notes. Maybe it might help me understand just what he was hoping to find out here, this *‘Omylia’.*

&#x200B;

His notebook was right where he’d left it and I thumbed through it. I don’t know whether or not I was actually surprised to find that most of it dealt with Omylia. I skimmed to a random page before pausing to read.

&#x200B;

*Omylia - Codex Velatus*

&#x200B;

*Appears in ‘The Song of the Sea’ within the Codex Velatus. So far this is the most comprehensive piece I’ve found. This also appears to be one of the older accounts describing Omylia. According to the Song of the Sea, Omylia was the first daughter within the Ocean of Creation, Sailia and she became the Ocean incarnate. She is called the Mother of Leviathans and the Patron of the Deep Church whos daughters are said to both swim like fish and walk on land.*

&#x200B;

*The description is consistent with what I saw in Malibu all those years ago. I’ve been digging into accounts describing the Daughters of Omylia but success has been limited. For now, I’m primarily focusing on the deity herself.*

&#x200B;

I skipped forward a few pages to another entry.

&#x200B;

*Lily’s description of whale disappearances matches some accounts I read about Omylia hunting Leviathans for sport. I found an old whalers journal describing what I think might have been a sighting, but I’m not sure. Why does a God need to hunt for food, though? The Kennard book I found suggests it’s some sort of ritual sacrifice to gain her favor, marking certain whales as an offering to her.* 

&#x200B;

*But by whom? The Deep Church? Information on that is scarce. I’ll need to see if I can find more. Maybe I should look into the ritual too. Best case scenario it can get me a sighting. If I can find some sort of proof, I’ll have a better chance of getting Dr. Griffin’s support on this.*

&#x200B;

Marking whales? My mind shifted back to the Orca pod that Dad had dragged us out here to find. Had he marked them somehow?

&#x200B;

I thumbed through a few more pages. A couple of them contained some kind of weird recipe for… something. I wasn’t entirely sure what. Finally, I closed the journal before stuffing it under my arm and heading over toward the crew's quarters. Jimmy was leaning by the door and gave me a nod before letting me in.

&#x200B;

I found Dad sitting on a bench at the far side of the room, nursing what was going to become a pretty bad black eye.

  “Stephen…” he said, sounding almost relieved. “You found my journal? Good. Did you bring me anything else from the engine room?”

&#x200B;

He reached for the book but I pulled it away from him.

  “Those whales,” I asked. “You did something to mark them, right?” I asked.

He paused.

  “There was a kind of marker that could be applied to them, yes…” He said after a few moments, “I may have marked the pod last year at the same time I tagged them. It was just a way to compare data. The pod originally had fifteen members. As you saw, that number has dropped pretty severely since they returned to this region, comparable to some of the other pods I tagged.”

&#x200B;

I caught myself grimacing in disgust at his words.

  “So you knowingly fed those whales to it?” I asked.

  “I needed bait to lure it in,” he corrected. “Look, I understand that this was a bit of an extreme measure. But I needed quantifiable data. You should understand that! I’m not happy about what I had to do, but this is worth it!”

&#x200B;

  “Why?” I asked, “Why do you want to find this goddamn thing so badly?”

  “Because if I can provide proof that Omylia is out there, even if I can’t prove she’s a God, then I can get the resources needed to study her properly and then… who knows what else we’ll find! Do you have any idea the myths and legends that are floating around out there? If we can prove one is true, how many others are true? There’s an untapped well of knowledge out there!”

  “Do you even hear yourself right now?” I asked, “Is this really what you want to do, Dad? Go looking for sea monsters?”

  “Once upon a time, people thought giant squid were only a myth,” Dad replied. “The Okapi was once thought to be a mythical creature. Now you can see them in a zoo. The world is so much bigger than we think it is. You should know that.”

  “I genuinely don’t believe you…” I said under my breath before shaking my head and turning away.

  “Oh, my journal, please!” Dad said. I tossed it to him without a word before I left. 

&#x200B;

We ate a quiet dinner that evening, only barely talking before we played a round of cards. Once we were done, I fixed up a plate for Dad to bring down to the crews quarters for him. Jimmy had given me the key to unlock the door and I knocked twice before opening it.

  “Dad? Dinner’s ready,” I called as I stepped inside.

He didn’t respond. 

  “Dad?” I called again as I ventured deeper into the crews quarters. As I entered the room where his cot was, I found him. 

&#x200B;

The moment I saw him, the plate in my hand crashed to the floor. He was almost in the exact same place he’d been before only now he’d stripped his shirt off and using the metal spiral that bound his notebook together had scratched something into his bare chest. He was on his knees now, hands clasped together as he muttered a quiet, frantic prayer. I couldn’t make out all the words of it, but the part I do remember is as follows:

&#x200B;

  *“Leviathan mother, come. Deep Empress, come. Make me reborn in the water, oh Mother Omylia. Give me new life within the sea.”*

&#x200B;

“What the hell are you doing?” I cried, running over to him to try pulling him to his feet. Dad just pulled away from me, fury entering his eyes.

  “We need evidence!” He snapped, “If we can’t follow the whales, I know something else to try…”

&#x200B;

I stared into my Dad’s eyes in disbelief. There was utter conviction in them. He truly believed that whatever he was doing was going to summon this God of his and as I stared at him, I didn’t know what to say. What exactly does one say to that kind of insanity?

&#x200B;

Then I felt the ship rock violently beneath us. I crashed down to the ground, hitting my head hard. Dad looked up, eyes widening in elation.

  “She’s here…” he said softly.

&#x200B;

Before I could stop him, he was on his feet again, running for the door.

  “DAD!” I called after him before scrambling to my feet to follow.

He sprinted up the stairs, running toward the top deck. The sky above us was pitch black and yet the sea around us was almost dead silent. Dad ran toward the bow of the ship, stopping once he reached the railing. I was right behind him, although the moment I saw what was in the water before us, I froze dead in my tracks.

&#x200B;

In the light from the ship, I saw a shape rising out of the depths. It emerged from the ocean, dripping water as it did and soaking the deck. I stared up at the shape, that sinking dread from before coming back with a vengeance. Whatever I’d feared when I’d set foot onto this boat… it had finally come and this was the shape it took.

&#x200B;

Dad looked up at it in awe as the dark shape towered over us, before sinking to his knees.

  “Mother…” he said, breathless and full of wonder.

&#x200B;

Behind me, I could hear Captain Scott and the others emerging from below deck. I heard them stop as they saw the shape rising out of the water before us.

  “Dad…” I called, my voice a trembling rasp, “Dad, get away from it! Dad, come back!” But he didn’t listen. He just looked back at me, grinning from ear to ear as he did.

&#x200B;

  “Do you see it?” he asked, “Take a picture… make sure everyone else sees it! Take a picture, Stephen!”

I could see dark tendrils rising over the railing of the boat. Dad looked back at the shape above us. I knew he saw the tendrils, but he didn’t dare move as they reached for him.

&#x200B;

  “Dad, wait! DAD!” I called before moving again.

  “TAKE A PICTURE, STEPHEN!” He called as the tendrils ensnared him. The massive shape leaned backward, collapsing into the water and pulling my Dad out of the boat.

&#x200B;

I screamed for my Dad and almost followed him overboard before I felt a strong pair of hands grabbing me from behind. I looked back to see Captain Scott. There was a look of genuine terror on his face. He pulled me back away from the bow, wrapping me in a bear hug as I yelled into the night.

  “DAD! DAD!”

&#x200B;

There was no reply.

&#x200B;

Mitchell was already in the wheelhouse, getting the boat moving again. They already knew what I couldn’t accept. 

&#x200B;

My Dad wasn’t coming back.

&#x200B;

I haven’t been on a boat ever since my expedition on the Seagull. I can’t even live by the sea anymore. Every time I look out at the water, I keep expecting to see a dark shape rising out of the waves, coming for me. Nowadays, I live in Arizona. I find I have fewer nightmares there. But even so far from the water, I’ve never forgotten what I saw that day and I’ve never forgotten the final Days I spent with my Dad.

&#x200B;

For the longest time, I’ve thought back to something he said to me during one of the last conversations we had. 

  *‘The world is so much bigger than we think it is. You should know that.’*

I realize now that he was right. I just didn’t want to admit it at the time.

&#x200B;

It’s why I don’t work in marine biology anymore. I’ve found another field to work in and I’d like to think he would be proud of the work I’ve done. Because he was right, the world is much, much bigger than we think it is. There are things out there that not even he could have ever conceived of.

&#x200B;

And one day, I hope to finish the work that he [started.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)
