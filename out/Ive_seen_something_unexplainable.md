Hello, I'd like to share something that happened to me when I was nine years old and that I remember really well even now that I am 35. I swear I'm not lying or seeking for attention, but it bothers me that I haven't been able to find a proper explanation until now so I am asking for your help.

I was on holidays with my family at Gabicce, a fairly known place on the Adriatic coast in Italy. I am mentioning it because there are several weird legends surrounding this region, like the Valbruna town's, which is known as the "Italian Atlantis", since it was apparently submerged by the sea for unknown reasons during Roman times, and fishers and locals claim to have found remnants of columns, temples and other proof of it, as well as an ancient temple dedicated to Zeus which was located on the St. Bartolo Mount, which is located just nearby, or miraculous sightings of the Virgin Mary. Also, It's quite an eerie place, because mountains, sea and towns are all merged together.

I was taking a stroll with my father, there were many people surrounding us because it was June and the streets near the seaside were crowded, when I suddenly saw something really weird laying on the pavement.

It was an animal's, a reptyle's apparently, claw, which had been cut off, but instead of dripping blood it oozed a clear, slimy fluid. It was dark green, almost black in colour, covered in scales, a little lighter underneath, with three slender digits, the middle one longer than the others, and every digit sported a curved claw, like a hen's foot. Of course I got really spooked off, and I instantly tried grabbing my father's attention about my discovery, but he looked really annoyed at me, claiming there was nothing on the pavement. I am absolutely sure he wasn't lying, but at the same time I am also really sure about what I saw. Nobody else seemed to notice that horrible paw, so I just walked away. When I got back a couple hours later and checked the same spot, there was nothing.

As I grew older, I did some research, and I found some similarities with a Tatzelwurm's claw (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatzelwurm), but since that creature is legendary and apparently doesn't really exists, I was more oriented believing that it could have been an abnormally big slow worm or lizard's claw, except that those usually have four digits instead of three and that they usually don't sport claws of any sort. I also researched about sea cryptids, but no sea worms or other creatures have been sighted in the Adriatic sea. If that was a cryptid's leg, though, other people should have seen it. Another possible (?) explanation is the Green Man, which is a legend about a reptile-human hybrid which has been sighted in various places near river Po in Emilia-Romagna, but it looks like he's really elusive and refuses contact with humans. I don't know what to believe anymore.

What really bothers me is that nobody apparently could see what I saw on that day... do you believe it might have belonged to some ghostly being? Or to a fae? Could someone help me understand? And who, or what, could cut it off like that? And for what reason?

These unanswered questions are really obsessing me lately...
