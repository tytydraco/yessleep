Back in June, my dad spotted the ad on the post office bulletin board. It said: *STRONG LAD NEEDED TO HELP OLD LADY.* ***NO WEAKLINGS.***

He punched the number into his phone and boasted about his seventeen-year-old son (me) who the school rugby coach called a ‘physical specimen’. He just left out the part about how I’d joined the Gaming & Anime Society instead of training with the squad…

“What if she thinks I’m not fit enough?” I asked him on the drive out to the marina.

“Just tell her you wrecked your ankle throwing a tackle and put on a bita bulk.”

“What if she asks a question about rugby? I don’t even know the rules.”

“She’s not gonna fucking ask.”

“But she’s a weirdo, everybody says. Even you! You told me half the town’s decorators act like that place is radioactive.”

“I couldn’t give two shits Wade, you’re not sitting on your arse all summer. If you wanted to be picky about jobs, you shoulda thought of that before you quit that cinema in the middle of your first fucking shift.”

“But they wrote me up for eating popcorn that was gonna be thrown out anyway, it was total bullshit.”

“And the petrol station?”

“That was different. Those supervisors were just dicks.”

His fingers wrapped around the steering wheel in a death grip, which I took as a sign to drop the subject.

My destination, a rocky isle named Whiteabbey, sat just off the coast of our hometown. Nobody at school knew much about the hermit who lived there except her cottage had electricity, because on clear nights you could see a tiny spec of light from the beach. Years ago, a girl in my class, Gillian, swore she saw the old lady in the pharmacy check-out line, threatening to put a hex on the nervous cashier for staring at her glass eye.

The entire school agreed Gilly was full of shit.

I followed Dad along the marina, over to a lune bobbing at the end of the last dock. From there, he watched until I’d sailed past the bay—probably because he thought I’d come straight back if he didn’t. Twenty-five minutes later, I marooned the boat on a pebble beach.

As I soaked in the landscape, my stomach felt uneasier than it did at sea. Like that feeling you get when you’re being watched.

The remote island was so large it’d take a half-day to walk around the coast, longer if you had nothing better to do than explore the hill maze in the centre. Past the shore, a grey, crooked cottage stood at the edge of a wild forest.

I zig-zagged through a minefield of used tissues coated with snot toward a rotten front door, the paint of which had flaked off in sheets. 

Inches away from the cockroach-infested letterbox, my hand hesitated. Even back then, Dad called me a crybaby because I needed help getting spiders out of my room; what if more creepy crawlies were throwing a mini-rave inside? Maybe if I applied for a job at PC World on the way home, he’d spare me another lecture about ‘responsibility’…

Before I could sidestep the tissues again in reverse, bolts clanked and the door slowly shivered open.

“Hello?” I called into a dusty hall.

“Well don’t just stand there,” a rough voice yelled back.

Damnit. If I turned back now, it would cost me internet privileges for an entire month.

Five steps into the landing, the door crashed shut behind me.

“I’m not getting any younger,” the voice called, agitated now. 

I hurried across a filthy carpet coated with shiny slug trails. The stale air reeked of cigarettes, which probably helped mask an even worse stink judging by all the black mould creeping out of the skirting boards.

Inside a kitchen with a warped floor, an ancient lady in a pink nightie sat behind a table, smoking away. Her gaunt appearance made me picture a dried raisin. 

“You must be Wade,” she said, then entered a harsh, chainsaw coughing fit.

“That’s right.”

“Sandra.” Her cloudy eyes—neither of which were glass—travelled up and down my torso as she stubbed out her ciggy in a ceramic ashtray on the table. “I thought your dad said you played rugby?”

“Uhh, yeah.” I slumped down, pushed out my belly. “I busted my ankle so I’ve put on a bit of bulk. If you need someone fitter I can go.”

The old lady stood with great difficulty and then jabbed a sharp, yellow fingernail into my midsection. She tutted now and then while I tried not to stare at the bluebottle flies roosted in her hair. “You squeamish? How are you with blood?” she asked.

“Not great.”

“Hmm. Well, suppose you’ll have to do. Grab the straps from that hamper and follow me.” She turned away, flicking her bony wrist in the air.

“What hamp—”

*Click*. A battered trunk sat in the corner, the top half flipped open. Inside I found straps threaded with loops and buckles. I grabbed them and followed Sandra into a messy room choked with clutter and antique furniture. Glass jars lined three of the four walls, some filled with pickled, floating things, others stationary butterflies and noisy crickets.

“Alright, I need you to lug all this junk out back. There’s a stump with a machete sticking out of it, drop it all off there, get it chopped up, and then we’ll have a bonfire.”

“You want me to burn it?”

“You’re as sharp as a golf ball, Wade.”

My eyes scanned the textbooks and piles of newspapers held together by string. “Don’t you need it?”

As if on cue, Sandra vomited a fat oyster into a scrunched-up tissue, which she presented to me. “See this?” There were red speckles throughout the sticky mess. “Father time’s in the rearview mirror, and I’m running on fumes. No point hauling this crap to the mainland.”

“Ahh, you’re moving then?”

“…Something like that. Now come on, chop chop.”

Sandra wanted everything destroyed: embroidered chairs, carved tables, musty rugs. If it wasn't bolted down, it got carted outside in a field overrun with weeds, surrounded by a scattering of trees. Without those lifting straps, I never would have managed to shift the heavy wardrobe—which housed a colony of woodlice—by myself.

As I hauled that junk puffing and panting all the way, Sandra’s voice travelled around the ground floor muttering to the bugs housed in those jars, which she released outside. Weird.

After I set the final wicker chair down, already exhausted, my hands dropped onto my knees. Sandra limped out through the back door and pointed at the machete embedded in a nearby stump. “Good. Now cut this stuff up and get a fire going.”

My first attempt barely grazed the top of a bookcase, but after some ‘corrections’ from Sandra—keep the blade straight, bring it down in an arc—the blade sliced through in a single stroke.

“Good. Keep that up, and come inside once you’re done.”

One hour later, with the furniture piled into a bonfire, my shoulder muscles went wild with spasms. A final, especially stubborn side table refused to break apart, no matter how hard I tried.

On the hundredth attempt, a nasty jolt of pain shot along my spine. Furious, I tossed the machete aside and hurled the table as far as I could. It soared through the air and disappeared into the shoulder-high weeds.

I took a minute to compose myself before going to retrieve it. I went back and forth, combing the grass with my foot, finding nothing except beetles and rocks. I looked at the woodland. No way my throw got *that* kind of distance.

Just in case, however, I pushed low branches aside, stepping over the arcs of exposed tree roots.

Up ahead, there was a sudden, scuttling movement. I only caught a glimpse from the corner of my eye, but enough to send goosebumps marching up my arms. A moment later a fern got set rustling, and I hurried back to the bonfire, where I wiped the sweat from my forehead, feeling stupid for getting spooked. The sidedesk was still lost amongst the weeds, but like Sandra was ever gonna find it. I got the fire going as quickly as I could and then found her in the kitchen, where she sat wheezing like an asthmatic child.

“All done?” she asked, between rasps.

“Aye. All done.”

She gave me a serious side-eye before saying, “In that case have a seat. I’ll make tea.”

“That’s okay.”

“Have a seat.” The edge in her voice squeezed me into submission.

Sandra moved around the room supported by the counters. With a lot of trouble, she poured me a cup of what looked like the toilet bowls in the school changing room, where flushing was practically illegal. “Here, it’s herbal. Good for the sinuses.”

I gulped the whole thing down out of politeness.

“You in school then?” she asked, groaning as she eased herself onto the seat facing mine.

“Yep. Just finished lower-sixth year. Hopefully my results are good, then I’ll go back and do my A levels in September.”

“Good, good. How you feeling? Lugging my stuff about, the chopping. You knackered?”

“Nope.”

She studied my face, her pale eyes narrowing, and then snapped her fingers. “Drop the crap. If you’re gonna work for me, I need honesty.”

Almost against my own will, I said, “I can’t remember the last time I was this wrecked.”

She grabbed an envelope from inside her nightie. It fell onto the table with a hefty thud. “That’s your take home for the day. There’s just one more thing I need help with then you’re done.”

She pushed herself up, letting out an unintentional groan. “Grab those lifting straps. I step into the front part like a onesie, then the buckle goes ‘round my waist."

“Wait, what?”

“You deaf?” 

“No.”

“Slow then?”

“No…it’s just…you mean I need to carry you?” 

Crap. Did she put out that ad hoping to find a BDSM sex slave? In my mind’s eye, Dad’s stern voice came barrelling along. *I don’t care if she asks you to apply her bunion cream with your tongue, you’re not sitting on your arse all summer.*

“What’s the hold up?” she asked.

“…Is this a…sex thing?”

Liquid laughter burst from her thin lips. “Don’t flatter yourself. After all this excitement, I need to go lie down, and those steps are torture on these knees on a *good* day.”

The buckles fastened around my arms and legs, and then Sandra attached to my back like a parachute.

Because my passenger’s fragile joints creaked and moaned worse than a haunted house in the middle of a lightning storm, I took great care climbing the stairs, terrified one wrong foot might have shattered her into a million different pieces. Boney ribs jabbed painfully into my spine every step of the way.

“Alright,” she said, dismounting beside a bed with a worn-out headboard. “I’ll probably need your help for the next two or three days. Come back tomorrow, same time. And wear a pair of hiking boots.”

I didn’t have any boots, but judging by the envelope she’d given me more than enough for a new pair. I said goodbye and closed the door on my way out.

Back at the lune, I counted my earnings. £300. Not bad. What a weird lady, though.

The entire journey home, every time a fish jumped out of the water, it set my nerves on high alert. That creepy island made me more anxious than I realized.

At the marina, I called Dad, who said, “£300? I don’t care if she asked you to carry her naked, you’re going back. You know what I got paid for my first days work? £3.54. And I came home stinking of—”

“—plucked feathers and chicken guts, I know.”

One dull lecture later, I made my way to the high street to buy boots and a copy of Diablo 4. That night I collapsed in bed, facedown.

The next morning, thick storm clouds hovered over Whiteabbey, so I wore a raincoat and brought a backpack filled with snacks.

Greeting me at the door, Sandra jabbed a sharp fingernail at the hills that dominated the centre of the island. “Take a look out West. See that basalt cliff? Open your eyes, fuck sake—it’s a giant rock hill. Shaped like Napoleon’s nose. Don’t tell me you’re blind as well as deaf?”

“I see it,” I said.

“Good. I need you to do a very important job for me.”

As she grabbed a jar from behind the door and stuffed it into my hands, something sour crept up my throat. It looked like she’d collected her own blood in there for weeks on end, and I’m pretty sure those were toenail clippings floating around the thick, hearty broth.

“Take this up to the cliff. Just below it you’ll find a cave. There’s a stone altar inside. Empty the jar on top of it.”

“…Can I ask why?”

“No,” was the response. “Now listen carefully, I’ve got eyes all over this island*. All over*. You do exactly what I said and how I said it. If you don’t, we’re gonna have a problem. A serious one. Understand?”

“Yeah.”

“Where did I ask you to go?”

“The cave. Near the cliff.”

“And what are you gonna do?”

“Pour this over the…altar thingy.”

“Alright. Get a move on then.”

I marched outside and started along the trail, feet crunching through gravel which gave way to squelching mud and a carpet of needles as the valley carried me up into the heart of the island. Above the canopy, Sandra’s house disappeared and then reappeared from view.

Up there, the sense of unease got way worse—like I wasn’t alone.

Still raw and stiff from the previous day's workout, my shoulders cried out for relief the entire time. Questions kept cycling through my mind, like what’s the significance of the jar? Why such a specific spot?

If you’d asked around town, you’d have heard a million different wild stories about Sandra; she was a witch doctor, a Buddhist, a former hippie hiding from authorities because her ex-husband disappeared.

From the way she talked with those bugs, though, I reckoned she was just a senile old-timer with nobody to care for her in her winter years.

An hour or so into my trek, thunder roared, and then rain came down sideways, hard and heavy. Sheltered beneath the ceiling of trees, I leaned against a rough trunk eating some Wotsits I’d packed. A cloud of midges circled my skull the entire time.

By my guesstimate, reaching the cave would take another two hours. Two hours, with my clothes heavy and stiff with water. And those bastard bugs nibbling at me if I didn’t swat them away every ten seconds.

Why’d the jar need to go up to the cave anyway? What difference did it make where I emptied the damn thing?

Holding the container as far from myself as possible, I unscrewed the lid and tipped it upside down until the crimson sludge oozed out.

As the moist dirt lapped it up, there was a steady rumble, low at first, but gradually growing louder. Almost like a drumbeat. Beneath my feet, the earth began to wobble, and my arms windmilled for balance, and that sense of unease you couldn’t escape on the island swelled. It felt like standing on the back of a great beast.

The second Whiteabbey went back to sleep, something caressed the back of my neck, gently. I whipped around, my skin shivering. 

Out in the forest, leaves stirred and branches got forced aside. There was a scurry of movement, which made me picture giant tarantulas dropping onto my head from above.

Whatever kept moving out there, there were lots of them—maybe even hundreds. Each bigger than my closed fist, scattering in every direction. I stood there, breath rasping in my chest, eyes darting all about, even the rain seeming to freeze with me, until wood splintered. This broke my paralysis.

I took off at top speed, sliding along the wet earth, only slowing down when gravel crunched underfoot.

Closer to Sandra’s house, no longer surrounded by a million different hiding places, the encounter hardly seemed so scary. I was just stressed. And overworked. And creeped out by bugs.

So that I didn’t get back suspiciously early, I took a long breather, chuckling at myself.

Afterwards, at Sandra’s place, I shook my coat dry, dropped my pack by the entrance, and set the empty jar on the table in the kitchen. “Mission accomplished.”

“You went all the way up there?” Sandra asked from her chair.

“Yup.”

“Right in the cave?”

“Right in.”

Her left eyebrow raised. “Were there any problems?”

“None.”

We stared each other down for a moment in awkward silence while she searched my expression for any signs of guilt.

“Can’t have been easy carrying all that extra flab up there,” she said finally. “Have a seat, I’ll make tea.”

I let the remark slide. I just wanted paid.

Sandra struggled to stay upright as she poured out another cup of tea, refusing my offers to help. She slammed the cup on the table and grimaced as she eased herself into the chair facing mine.

“So…where are you moving to?” I asked, hoping this might ease the tension.

She lit a cigarette, took a drag.

“You know my aunt moved into that Redburn nursing home. She was nervous at first, but now we can’t get her out of the place. Says it’s like a hotel.”

More silence.

“Still, I bet you’ll miss the peaceful nights out here, huh?”

Her mouth remained a grim, straight line. Crap. She knew.

Quickly I drained the piping-hot tea. “That was delicious. Thanks for—”

“You ever hear of a sky burial Wade?” Sandra stubbed her cigarette out in the ashtray.

“…No.”

"There you go, that's your homework for tonight. Do teachers still give homework?"

“Sometimes.”

She fished another envelope from her inside pocket and dropped it on the table. This one looked even thicker than the last. 

“Is that mine?”

She gave a faint nod.

A tightness in my chest eased. Why pay me if she thought I’d cheated her? “Anything else you need me to do today?”

She shook her head.

“Awesome.”

Before I could grab the envelope, Sandra’s dry, arthritic claw clamped around my wrist in a flash.

I tried reeling away, but it was like being trapped in the pincers of a vice grip. “Is…is everything okay?”

As she squeezed, pressure built up in my hand until the fingertips throbbed like a heartbeat, the forearm starting to swell.

“Did I do something wrong?”

Her thin lips twitched over in a cruel grin. “Like lie to a helpless old lady so you can swindle her money?”

Oh fuck. “Sandra, about that. I just—"

As sharp fingernails bit into my flesh, I sprang up so fast my chair toppled backwards and the table flipped over, vomiting its contents across the floor. I wrenched my arm away and threw myself backward, Sandra struggling to stay upright as she got dragged along with me, until my back hit a cabinet full of noisy saucepans.

Those nails bit deeper and deeper until thin streams of blood leaked out. My free hand curled into a fist, but before I could drive it into Sandra’s nose her mouth hinged open. Stale prune breath engulfed my nostrils, so rotten I knew straight away I’d never eat Dad’s tuna casserole again. 

She choked out a series of words I didn’t understand, spraying me with globs of milky spit, and then cold air flooded the room, flooded my body. Cabinets and drawers slammed open and shut by themselves.

A hideous buzz rang out, coming from *inside* Sandra’s mouth, which creaked open wider and wider. Through the gaping hole I saw insectile forms, hundreds of them, crawling over the top of one another, jostling, buzzing.

I slammed my fist into the centre of the lunatic’s face. As she continued speaking, wasps came crawling out through her mouth and past her lips, and then the winged bastards rose into the air and stung me in the neck and arms.

She entered this sort of trance, her every word hitting me like a hammer between the temples. Each time I blinked the wasp swarm seemed to double in size, becoming a vortex that spiralled around us blocking out the world roaring louder than traffic, and I knew soon they'd fly inside my mouth and I'd die with their stingers lodged in my tongue and throat.

Trapped, helpless, I squeezed my eyes and mouth shut until, out of nowhere, that built-up pressure in my hand deflated like a balloon and the buzzing vanished.

My left eye peeked open. Beside my feet, blood gushed from a wheezing Sandra’s nostrils, her friends now gone.

I didn’t even consider helping for one second, just made a desperate break for the door. Somehow I remembered to grab my backpack in the middle of that mad scramble.

I sprinted straight past the beach, pushed out the lune until the waves lifted it with a burble of water, and hurled myself into the bow. What followed was probably the fastest boat ride of my entire life. There was a red welt across my tender wrist but no pierce marks or stings.

Back in the safety of the harbour, several fishermen turned to take in the hysterical teenager and then looked away, heads shaking with disgust.

I rushed home threw my backpack to one side and dropped onto my bed. I’m not sure how long I lay there before noticing the envelope tucked into the pack’s side pocket. *Sandra’s* envelope. When did she even stash it there?

Inside was £3000, all in crisp twenties. This set me off pacing around my room, my thoughts a jumbled mess. 

I couldn’t explain what happened or what Sandra was, but by accepting her money, had I got myself into some sort of…magic debt? Maybe now she could throw a curse on me. Hell, maybe she already did. Shit shit shit.

That money needed to go back, but how? If I set foot on Whiteabbey, she might have made boils grow over my entire body. Half the townfolk avoided that place, and not only would Dad *not* believe my story, he’d probably drag me back there in a straitjacket if he discovered the kind of cash getting thrown around.

Before I could get any of this straight in my mind, my phone chirped. It was her.

“That you Wade? Can you hear me?” The mucus oozing from Sandra’s lips came through the speaker, loud and clear. Her lungs sounded even weaker than before. “Now look, I’m sure you’re a little rattled, but I need you to listen carefully. Maybe grab a pen and write this down ‘cause I know you have trouble with instructions.

“By now even *you* should have worked out you weren’t hired for any ordinary job. I’ll not get into the specifics, but you fucked up big time, so now I need you for one more day. Consider the 3 grand an advance.”

After hacking up more phlegm, she said, “Right about now you’re probably thinking ‘fuck that’—”

She’s right, I was.

“—but what happened in the kitchen? That’ll be a drop in the ocean compared to what comes next if you take my money and run. Get back here tomorrow and let yourself in. I’ll leave a key under the welcome mat. See you then.”

With that she hung up, leaving me with an impossible decision: ignore her warning, and risk the consequences.
