We were meeting after a long time. Me, Nitish, Naru, and Raj. We were best friends from high school.  
Now we live in different cities in India, doing different jobs. It was Raj's 28th birthday. The plan was that we would go to Goa, chill on the beach, drink, and party. But Naru changed the plan at the last minute. He shouldn't have done that. Now all of us are paying the price for that in our own ways.

"It's one of the most beautiful places in the world," he told. "We will go there, then eat, drink, chill, and come back."  
As any sane person, I raised a question: "But why at night time?"  
"Because it's the most beautiful then," he replied.

The name of the place is Kalasa, a village near Chikmagaluru. He has been there, but in daytime with his parents. It's a kind of secluded place and a "hidden gem," according to him.

Nitish bought his SUV, so we packed our things and started our journey. It was a 4-hour drive. I don't know why I was having this tingly feeling in my stomach. I get this when I am nervous, but I was with my friends, going on a trip—I didn't know why I was nervous. Well, now I know.

The closer we got to our destination, the worse the quality of the roads became. We were seeing fewer and fewer people on the street. Then suddenly Naru told Nitish to stop. It was a dhaba (a small restaurant for truck drivers).  
"We will not get anything beyond this point," Naru said.

We bought almost everything from the shop—from booze to food, everything. Chicken kebabs, biryani, tandoori fish, and many dishes along with cigarettes, cold drinks, rum, and beer.  
It was almost 4 in the afternoon; it was getting dark. It was not a road anymore that we were on—it was a trail of pebbles. Our network stopped working after a point, and so did Google Maps.

Naru assured us he knew the way; he was giving directions to Nitish. I was just worried about not getting robbed because it was really dark and literally nowhere.

"STOP, we are here," Naru said suddenly. "We are here."  
Well, to be honest, it was (on the outside) one of the most beautiful places in the world. We were kind of near a cliff—a really short one. Below, there was a lake. A really quiet, tranquil lake. We reached there when it was completely dark. The moon was shining bright and its reflection was in the lake like a mirror.

Raj and the others started clicking pictures. I was mesmerized and also worried at the same time. Looking at those tall, big dark trees surrounding the lake and us, I felt intimidated. Being from a city, I was never used to this much silence; it was eerie.

We cut the cake and sang happy birthday. We were laughing, chatting, and having beer. Then we took out the food.  
Now, many people might not know, but we have a thing here in India—a belief that we should not eat non-veg food or drink alcohol in a jungle or in an area like this, as it attracts… well, some otherworldly stuff. The reason people believe, is they still crave these earthly pleasures that they can no longer have.

I asked them, "Guys, should we eat inside the car?"  
"Why, it's so much nicer and comfortabel outside," Nitish says. Well, being a chemistry professor in a college—a "man of science"—if I had said why I was proposing this, they would have made fun of me. I still believe in superstitions, they would have thought.

We started eating and drinking outside, sitting on a plastic sheet. I was getting chills on my back—the same chills that sometimes guys get while taking a leak. I was kind of urging them to hurry and leave that place ASAP. But they were not scared; they were enjoying themselves, unlike me.

Then Nitish did something… well… bad, in my opinion. He threw a stone in the lake. It was a small stone but still made quite a big splash sound. I snapped at him, "Why did you do that?" He was like, "Whaat, come on dude, chill, what will happen?" I don't know why I said, "People might get disturbed." He chuckled and said, "Dude, literally no one lives here." Well, he was right? Nope!

Raj had an idea of going beside the lake. Well, it was not that far or deep, but I was like, "Let's get back." Naru was like, "It's a good plan; let's go. We should not let the birthday boy's wish fail," he said.

There was a slope almost like stairs made of stone. Following that, we went down. Now we were on the same level as the lake. We sat there on a patch of grass. And believe me, all four of us kind of got lost, staring at the deep dark water body. We weren't just sitting; we were looking at the lake.

"I have to pee," the birthday boy said. I think we just nodded our heads. He went below a big banyan tree and started doing his deed.

I didn't know how much time had passed; I was in a trance. I snapped out of it when Nitish called me.  
"Bro, where is Raj?"  
He was not there, near the tree. It was panic time. We started calling out his name and looking for him. Naru shouted after 2 minutes, "Found him, come this side," a few meters beyond the tree.

He was sitting there, looking at the tree with a blank stare. We went near him and said, "What are you doing here, bro? Let's go!"  
He looked at me in horror. I will never forget the face that Raj made at that point. "She won't let me go," Raj said. "She is not leaving me."  
There was literally no one except us. I asked, "Who? No one is here, bro." Raj pointed towards the tree and said, "She, bro, that woman in the tree." All of us looked at the tree where Raj was pointing. No one was there.

Naru said, "He's drunk." I said, "Raj, okay bro, enough, let's go." I held his right hand and tried to drag him. He screamed in pain and horror, "I can't, she is holding my hand!" Raj held his left hand up toward the tree like someone was really holding his hand. He was kind of in a "my heart goes out to you… salute!" kind of position.

We all dragged him towards us, and then we started semi-running towards our car. Raj was still screaming, "My hands hurt, please let me go." And then I saw something unexplainable. There were red scratching marks, bruises on his left hand, as if someone was really holding his hand tightly for a long time.

I asked Nitish to start the car while I tried to calm Raj. Then I looked at Naru—he was on his knees, looking at the lake. It looked like he was talking to someone or praying. He was making some weird sounds. Seeing that, I thought, today I am going to die, because something is seriously wrong here.

"I can't find the keys," Nitish almost cried. Naru stood up upon hearing that.  
"I have it," Naru said as he took out the car keys from his pocket, and then looked at us as if he was full of guilt.  
"Sorry, you guys can't leave," he said, throwing the keys into the goddamn lake.

"No, what have you done..." Nitish and I ran towards him—maybe to beat him up.  
But the moment I let Raj go, I saw the most bizarre thing in my life. An invisible force was dragging Raj, holding him by his left hand, really fast towards the lake, towards the tree.

Nitish and I stopped, shocked. Naru was laughing or crying—I couldn't tell. Then Naru screamed, "Now please give me my parents back, you asked for two, I bought you three as promised."  
We stood in disbelief. Then I suddenly saw Nitish on the ground having seizures. Raj was gone, I don't know where. Nitish was the only person I had. I tried to hold his head steady; he shook violently, but still he took out his wallet trembling and murmured, "Extra keys."  
There was another set of car keys in his wallet's small pocket. Nitish said, "GO."  
"Not without you," I said. I held him up in my lap and tried to move, but Naru pushed me from behind. We fell down. I somehow kicked Naru and we got into the car.

The moment I started the car, I saw her—a woman in a red saree with really long hair. She was standing beside Naru, who was trying to get up. She looked odd, like she was kind of floating a few feet above the ground. She was here, but also not here; it is hard to describe. And her feet were backwards.  
I just pushed the accelerator and ran. I was driving the car, but I did not know where I was going. Nitish was not looking good—he was unconscious and his nose was bleeding.

Then I saw—well, I don't know what the fuck it was. I saw an old man sitting in a chair in the middle of nowhere reading a newspaper. He was looking at me, smiling creepily. After a while, I saw him again—this time his eyes were angry, but the creepy smile was still visible. And then a few times more. It was like I was in a loop, driving the same path over and over.

I stopped. Well, I had to.  
The old guy was now in front of the car, holding the same newspaper in his hand. He stood up from the chair. Then he started saying something to me—I don't know how he said it because he was quite far, and all the car windows were closed, and his mouth was not moving. But I know he said, "Naru and his family broke many rules there. You guys broke those rules today also. She is very angry today because Raj pissed near the tree—her home. Naru promised three but only two are given, Raj and Naru himself. You have to give Nitish as per the deal. And if you want them back, bring four more people here."

Sorry, bro, I pushed Nitish outside the car as gently as possible. He was still unconscious. "I will be back for you. Maybe." I started driving again.  
Suddenly, I could almost see the sun rising—and the same trail of pebbles. After an hour or so I saw some local people and then the same dhaba where we had stopped previously.

I am writing this down while sitting here in the dhaba. I don't know what to do. I cannot go without them. Should I take the chance and try to bring four more people to that place? I want my friends back. Maybe not Naru, but Nitesh and Raj.
