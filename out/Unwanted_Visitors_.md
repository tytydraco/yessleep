Life has been peaceful since moving from New York to Kansas. Kellysville to be exact. A small rural community, and just as welcoming as you'd expect. The culture shock passed in a matter of days.  Taking that job offer was the best thing for me in a lot of ways.  Life really was going my way. Like always though, nothing good lasts forever.

I'm here because my work, satellites to keep it simple, is here.  I'm a single man in his late twenties so the move wasn't a issue.  Honestly I needed the change.  The stagnant nature of life sometimes can get to you.  It's strange how moving to the middle of nowhere essentially in turn changed everything for me, mentally at least.

I've spent the last three months working hard at the station, and in the field.  Spending my nights at local taverns ,or staying in to enjoy the solitude.  I thought I was alone out here.  I'm not though.  I've got company...

Not the typical neighbors or friends for dinner kind of company.  The torment you psychologically and possibly physically kind of company.  I've coined the term visitors to describe them.  I hope it's just a visit.  They've been toying with me for weeks at this point.  Three long dreadful weeks of coming home to dead cattle in the pastures.  I'd say the cleanup sucked, but there was no need. The cows were bone dry.  And empty...

In the physical and spiritual way. No soul, no life, and also no organs.  No eyes, tongue, teeth, heart, nothing left except the husk of innocence.  I know to some there just cows, but if you'd seen them you'd understand.  This was wrong...too clean...there was no emotion behind this slaughter.  

That's not all that's been bothering me.  My power has been on the Fritz, but that's minor compared to waking up to the foundation of my house violently shaking as I'm being blinded by an enveloping light.  Then suddenly I'm no longer in my bed.  Im outside...fifty feet in the air...hovering.  Looking at the grass beneath me I can see it being scorched instantaneously.  Scorched is a serviceable way to describe it.  It was more like the grass was dissolving though.

I'm slowly being lowered by an invisible force towards the ground.  At about twenty feet up, with no warning, I'm free falling.  Smacking the packed dirt, I feel my knees throbbing.  All I could do was lay there and barely turn over to face the sky.

Above me was a...was a....it was a UFO okay...I know I tried discounting the experience too, but I know what I witnessed.  It stayed there above me hovering....watching... observing me.  I felt naked. Vulnerable. Afraid.  After staring directly into the beam for about a minute, I couldn't bear it any longer and looked away.  Closing my eyes shut tight.

When I opened them it was gone.  I looked around and noticed that the world was quiet. Not quiet actually silent.  Standing up with the help of a tree, i took a look at the landscape surrounding me.  All of the remaining cattle had been unmercifully eviscerated.  I'm not ashamed to admit I started bawling at that moment.  It was therapeutic to cry.  So I did for a good while...

I don't remember making my way to bed, but apparently i did.  I woke up this morning with a migraine so intense I vomited all over my floor.  The vomit was green.  Not like naturally green, but like chemically green. Too green.  Stumbling into my bathroom I looked into the mirror, and to my horror there were slits on my torso.  My face was worse....one of my eyes....I don't know...it was just white...like no pupil or retina....just white with vessels punctuating the empty space...

That would be all for now if I didn't just see that damn ship on my way home from work.  I wore an eye patch and claimed to have irritation.  As for my legs.  They surprisingly feel fine.  They shouldn't Im aware, but they do... anyway on my home I saw it again.  The dark blue lights rising above the treeline.  My windows were down so the humming of the ship could be heard.  I pressed the gas a little bit harder and headed home. When I pulled into my yard the world was once again silent...

That was about two hours ago.  No activity yet, but I'll be ready...Thanks to whoever reads this...I just needed to write it all down...anyways good night and remember keep an eye on the sky.....who knows how many they have on us...
