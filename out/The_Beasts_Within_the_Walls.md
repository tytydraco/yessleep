There is something to be said about the peace of a storm raging in the sky above a city.

The steady drum of the rain as it beats against the roof tiles above your head.

The whistling of the wind as it passes through the trees just beyond the glass pane of your window.

The deafening crack of thunder and the rumbling of the earth as bolts of lightning dance across the sky before they crash down to earth.

I welcomed the storm with open arms on this night of all nights.

The rain would cleanse the streets of the blood and filth and, with it, what had been done.

The rivers and streams would run red with the gore and blood of a thousand corpses.

This day had been the worst of any day in all my life.

To feel, you must first understand.

The masses rose up in defiance of the church and what they had done.

Crowds filled the streets and bashed against each other like waves in an unending sea.

Their thousand torches were as bright as the light of the sun.

Claw and steel and gunpowder cut them down by the hundreds.

A veil of black smoke consumed the sky as the city burned beneath it.

Plumes of smoke seemed to rise from every corner as the roars of something awful pierced the silence.

The setting sun brought with it a quiet I hadn't known in days.

Those precious moments seemed to hint at an end to this.

And yet, the madness seemed to continue well into the night.

The screams of men and women alike filled the air every moment as the city consumed itself under the dark veil of a moonless sky.

The elderly and children had long since perished, their frail bodies unable to fight off the madness that lay within their own heads.

They became the things we fear now. They are gone.

Nothing can save them, not even god himself.

He has forsaken us now. We delved too deep into that which we don't understand.

The church promised they would save us from the plague of beasthood.

Such a plague that rips you apart from the inside and twists your body into something that shouldn't exist in this world.

I have seen them.

Their shadows walk like men and even talk like them, but their bodies reveal them for what they are.

Monsters.

Their blood has stained my hands forever.

I was like you once. I chose sides. I fought for what I thought was right.

Open rebellion against the church was the right thing to do.

They caused this with their experiments and their lies.

They told us the plague was just a test every man must face.

And now the world as I knew it was gone, reduced to nothing but blood and bone.

They deserved to be slaughtered like cattle.

Their cloaks and crosses did nothing to save them from the blades that slit their throats.

They should have never delved deeper into the mines.

What they found will haunt mankind forever.

Blood. Blood was the start.

They consumed it and twisted it to their will.

Blood from a god does not transcend you to a pane of existence beyond your own.

It turns you into a monster like those that roam the streets now.

They knew what would come.

The old texts of a bygone era told what would happen if they dared embrace their childish curiosities.

The church didn't heed the words of those who came before us.

They challenged it. Presented it as a means to an end.

This was the next step for mankind. To transcend past our own level of conscience.

It was all a lie.

They did this to the city and those who dwelled inside its walls.

The streets I had once roamed were now nothing more than a field of blood.

The roads and paths I used to walk were stained red with the lives of people I once knew.

Now that night has fallen, the time has come.

There are others like me who have accepted the fate that has fallen to us.

We must purge the world of this disease like those who came before.

Fire cleanses all.

Mankind will survive past this night if we only fulfill our duty.

The storm's hold on the city is tightening by the second.

It will cover our advance into the homes and places these beasts rest.

We will cull them from the city under the cover of rain and thunder.

The smell of iron and death will become nothing more than a warning to those who hide in the shadows.

They will know us for what we are and what we bring.

Death to those that are infected with the plague of beasthood.

And yet, something is itching at the back of my brain.

The beast's blood seems to call to me like a whisper.

Something that is nothing more than a thought at most.

Its itch is so deep that my fingers can't reach it no matter how hard I scratch my scalp.

It is all over my body and my clothes from the hours before.

The beasts seem to bleed more than an ordinary man.

My clothes smell of the blood and rot that comes from within their bodies.

The smell that brings me such a sense of euphoria that I can almost taste it.

The knock on my door pulls me from the moment.

The time has come.

The plague of beasthood will be cullled.

Blood will flow through the streets as it never has before.

We are no longer men.

We are no longer fathers or sons.

We are hunters for the night is long and full of terrors.
