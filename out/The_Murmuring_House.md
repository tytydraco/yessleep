They called it the *Murmuring House.*

It was an old house, built at the end of Stephen’s Lane. It wasn’t about the way it looked—plain white stone walls, red brick tiles on the roof and a beautiful garden full of flowers. It was the sounds.

Every passerby talked about the same thing.

*The murmurs.*

The voices were extremely low,  sometimes no louder than a whisper. But you’d always swear you heard them.

Despite seeming to be in perfect condition,  the house had been unoccupied for the last 7 years. The landlord had lowered the price 5 times, but nobody wanted it. Everyone had heard the stories–people losing their minds, entire families either dying or disappearing. It was enough to discourage anyone.

The Millers were not one of those people. James Miller had just got himself a new job and the family was getting pretty desperate for a home. They did not pay any attention to the stories about the house. The town gave the family a month, because that was how long the victims usually lasted.

**Week 1**  
The family shrugged off the rumors. “Small-town tales,” James told his wife Sarah as they unpacked. The son, Timmy, had greater problems, like fitting into a new school and making new friends. The worries of a spooky haunted house seemed non-existent to the introverted boy. The house was really good for its price. 2 rooms, a study for James and an amazing lawn. The house already had the essential furniture. The basement was off limits to the family, though. The landlord said something about ‘unstable walls’ and asked them not to open it. The family happily agreed, not wanting to miss such an unbelievable offer. The house was too good. Maybe the best they could find in the town.

The murmurs started on the third day.

Sarah was the first to notice. At night, she heard a faint voice, calling for her.

*Sarah.*

“Honey, do you hear that?” she nudged her husband awake.

“Probably just the wind outside, nothing to worry about, love” said James, half-asleep.

Sarah thought it made sense, but found it odd; all the windows in the room were closed.

“Daddy, were you the one in the garden last night?” Timmy asked the following morning.

“No son, I was asleep. You must have heard the night guard.” answered James as he prepared the breakfast.

Timmy decided not to question any further, but he was sure the voice he heard in the garden belonged to his father. And it was calling his name.

**Week 2**  

By the second week, everyone had experienced something strange which they couldn’t explain.

James would often snap out of a trance at his desk, only to find the phrase "Can you hear us?" scrawled across his screen hundreds of times. He also received calls from unknown numbers, asking him to “let us out”.

Sarah started finding strange, dark red spots all over the house. No matter how much she cleaned them, they would come back. While cleaning the basement, she found what appeared to be hundreds of names, written on the basement walls. No matter how hard she scrubbed, she was unable in erasing any of them. The basement really was in a terrible state; the cracks and crevices made it look way older than the rest of the house. She did not want Timmy to get hurt while playing here, so she decided to lock the door once again.

Timmy began speaking about a man in the basement, whom he called the Ear Man. In his words, Ear Man was tall and covered in ears of all sizes. As his fascination with this Ear Man grew, he started speaking of how the figure whispered to him at night, sharing secrets about the house and said he loved their voices. Soon, Timmy started whispering by the basement door, even drawing unsettling images of him on his bedroom wall, and spoke of his constant listening.

His parents dismissed it just imagination; even when they heard voices in the basement one night.

Their own voices.

**Week 3**

The family had fallen apart.

James had barricaded himself in his study, driven to the brink by the relentless whispers that seemed to seep from every crevice of the house. He thought that isolation might silence the voices, but they followed him, growing louder in his solitude. His Word documents were filled with the same word, over and over again:

LISTEN.

Notebooks, once filled with ideas and notes, were now consumed by frantic scrawls of the same request. The walls, once painted in a cozy shade of blue, now had the phrase carved and scratched all over them.

Sarah kept scrubbing and cleaning the house, even when her hands turned raw and started bleeding, mumbling something about ‘keeping the house happy’. The dark red spots were all over the house now, originating from the basement and creeping all over the walls. It seemed like the walls themselves were bleeding.

The house even crawled into little Timmy’s dreams. Every night, he’d have the same dream. All alone, standing at the top of the stairs that led to the basement. He would hear muffled voices behind the door. The voices of Mommy and Daddy. Ear Man would urge him to open the door and talk about how he ‘couldn’t wait for him to meet the others’.

The family stopped talking to each other. They didn’t need to. The house whispered everything they wanted to hear.

**Week 4**

When the Millers stopped responding to calls and doorbells, the neighbors grew concerned and alerted the police. Upon entering the house, everything appeared untouched, as if it had been cleaned meticulously. The sharp scent of bleach and disinfectant hung in the air, too strong to ignore. But when the basement door was unlocked, a wave of putrid odor hit them like a tsunami. Inside, the decomposing bodies of James and Sarah lay sprawled on the floor. The authorities couldn’t determine the cause of death; some speculated it was something they weren’t willing to share. Timmy, their son, was nowhere to be found. Nine years have passed, and still, no trace of him.

The only thing left to guide the detectives was the hundreds of names, including James, Sarah, and Timmy, scrawled desperately across the basement walls.

The case was never solved—just another story lost in the whispers of the house. The town moved on. “Another family consumed by the house,” they all said.  

But at night, if you ever walked on Stephen’s Lane, passing by the house, you’d swear you heard them—James, Sarah and Timmy—whispering and murmuring along with the past occupants.

If you listen closely, you might hear your name too.
