Can you see them? No… Of course not. If everyone could see them news reports would be blasting non-stop. Maybe… only the ones they touch can see them. In that case I’m not sure how much this is going to help. Maybe it’s useless. It might be… but I can’t give in to apathy just yet. I still have some of my soul swimming around.

There are these creatures, monsters, aliens, maybe? Things. There are these things that hunt us. They are invisible at first, until they make contact. I think. God. I don’t know for sure but it’s my best guess. The things, they feed on our emotions. I don’t mean like IT, where fear makes it stronger. I mean they literally rip your emotions, your ability to feel, out of you. For me, it was a jagged hand that tore through my chest. The pain was excruciating, as if the hand going through me truly was punching a hole through my torso. Except, when it removed its arm, my body was fine. I was not fine. I could feel it. Something inside me was ripped out, something was missing. I felt… Hollowed.

That’s what I’ll call them. Hollowers. I saw it standing over me, its hand held an ethereal orb of constantly shifting color. It stood about 6 feet above me, humanoid but jagged. Like it was made of broken glass. Its digits on its fingers and toes were extraordinarily long and sharp. Its… skin? I don’t know if it even has skin. All I could see was black. Black so dark it consumed the light around it, almost like staring into a black hole. The light it held, my light, I watched as it swallowed my light inside its endless maw. No eyes. No teeth. Just a hole that I watched the colors from my soul be drained down until they were nothing.

I ran. It watched as I ran but it gave no chase. It simply stood there, as if it knew I would never really escape. And it was right. I’ve seen it so many times since. I can see it coming now, but no matter what I do it always catches me. It’s taken from me each time. Hollowed me more and more. I think I can still feel rage. I know I still feel fear. I am in a constant state of fear, but that is all. That is all that is left of me. Rage and fear. And maybe desperation. I’m sorry to drop all of this on you, Leon, or at least I wish I was sorry. I know I should feel sorry. That might be the worst part. I know what I should be feeling but I just can’t feel it anymore.

I don’t feel love. I don’t feel happiness. I don’t even feel sorrow for the emotions I lost anymore. I see it again Leon. I see it right now. And I hear it. Oh God. Leon, it’s speaking to me. I don’t know what will be left of me after this. Please. Help. It’s getting louder. I can hardly think anymore I- AUGH!

Those are the last words from my former best friend, Sonny. That was the call he made shortly before he went on a mass killing spree. My best friend. A man who lived for his dogs and worked as a school guidance counselor. Who gardened special plants for endangered butterflies and donated blood plasma on a regular basis, went on to kill nine people in what police describe as a drug-induced rage. The toxicology reports came up empty, but they had no other explanation how a 5’9 and 130 pound man (175 cm and 59 kilo) could kill nine people while unarmed. Four officers tried to restrain him. They tried tasers, pepper spray, targeted strikes. The police had to shoot him. After watching the bodycam footage, I don’t blame them. He was sick, something awful went wrong in his head, and it had tragic results.

That’s what I thought at least, but now I know he was telling the truth. It has stolen from me too. It tore my throat open and swallowed whatever was inside. The Hollowers. It’s not just one. There are so many. I see them stalking people as I drive, as I myself try to outrun my own Hollower. I know I’m only buying time but I need ideas.
