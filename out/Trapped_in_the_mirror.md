It all started with a silly game of hide-and-seek in the woods. My husband and I were taking a weekend getaway to a friend's cabin in the woods, and we decided to bring our 8-year-old daughter, Lily, along for some family bonding time. We didn't expect anything out of the ordinary to happen, but we were wrong.

It was Lily's turn to hide, and she ran off into the woods giggling. My husband and I counted to 100 and started searching for her. We called her name, but there was no answer. We searched for a good hour before we found her, but what we saw when we did find her was something we never could have imagined.

Lily was standing in front of an old, rusty mirror that was propped up against a tree. She was staring intently at her reflection, and she seemed to be in a trance. We called out to her, but she didn't respond. We walked closer to her, and that's when we saw it. A figure was standing behind her, almost as if it was standing inside the mirror.

We were horrified, and we tried to grab Lily and pull her away, but she was stuck. It was as if the figure in the mirror had taken hold of her and wouldn't let go. We tried everything we could think of to free her, but nothing worked. We even tried breaking the mirror, but it wouldn't break.

We were completely at a loss for what to do. We couldn't leave Lily there, but we couldn't free her either. My husband suggested we call the police, but I knew they wouldn't believe us. No one would believe that our daughter was trapped in a mirror because of a figure in the woods.

We spent hours trying to figure out what to do, but nothing worked. Eventually, we had to leave to get help. We drove to the nearest town and went to the police station. We told them everything that had happened, but they didn't believe us. They thought we were crazy and accused us of making up some elaborate story.

We were devastated. We didn't know what else to do. We went back to the cabin and tried everything we could think of to free Lily, but nothing worked. We even tried talking to the figure in the mirror, but it didn't respond.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. We were stuck in that cabin, unable to leave because we couldn't leave Lily behind. We tried to get help, but no one would believe us. We were stuck in a nightmare, and we didn't know how to escape.

As the days went on, Lily's condition worsened. She started to look sickly and weak. We could see her fading away, and we knew we had to do something before it was too late. We tried one last time to break the mirror, but it wouldn't budge.

She was trapped, with no way out. The figure in the mirror had taken our daughter, and we were powerless to stop it. We were left to wonder if we would ever see our daughter again or if we would be trapped in this nightmare forever.
