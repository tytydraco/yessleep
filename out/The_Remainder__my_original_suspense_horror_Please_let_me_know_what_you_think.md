The Remainder  
  
In a poorly lit surveillance room the detective sits in front of a black and white freeze frame of a 5 year old girl leaving a clothing store holding hands with who appears to be her grandmother. The woman is wearing a large brim summer hat and a dark colored dress. He hits play on the VCR and the 2 casually walk off the screen to the right. Roughly 20 seconds later a woman runs out of the same store, frantically looking around. This was the young girl's mother, yelling hysterically for her little girl. The sound quality is poor but you can hear the distress.   
  
The detective would rewind the footage several times, making sure to catch every detail. He was able to pause on the 1 frame in which the woman glanced up at the camera. 1 frame where her large hat did not hide her face although she had on large sunglasses. Older lady, rather skinny, maybe 60. The detective sat back in the chair. This woman is basically in disguise. Even the loose, dark colored dress hid her figure. So was this premeditated? It was starting to appear so. It still doesn’t make sense why the little girl was holding the woman’s hand so naturally. 5 year olds usually have a good defense mechanism against strangers called screaming. A reasonable assumption here was that the child knew this person. The devastated mother stated that her daughter, Chrissy, was the more cautious kind of child and would never walk off with anyone let alone a stranger. The mother did see the woman in the store and it wasn’t someone she knew.  
  
As the detective again watched the woman and Chrissy walk off the screen he switched over to the second VCR that recorded their continued path. He pressed play and waited. But they never entered the screen. Was he on the wrong timestamp? The detective motioned for the mall security to come over and double check. He was reassured that it was right.  
“So why haven’t they entered camera 2 yet?” the detective asked.  
The security guard looked perplexed, “I have no idea sir.”  
But he can hear the faint, staticy screams of the panicked mother so it had to be the right time frame. He can see other mall goers turn their heads to in the direction of the screaming.   
The detective asked,“Are there any exits between camera 1 and 2?”  
The guard rubbed his chin to think. The impatient detective got up and said, “Nevermind son. I’ll just go take a look.”  
  
The detective stood in front of the clothing store for a while taking in the environment. 2 uniformed officers come up to him and he gives them instructions for surrounding stores. As they walked off he finally went inside the clothing shop. One of the clerks said she did see the woman with the large hat leave with the child and with a tinge of guilt had to add that the little girl seemed perfectly fine walking out with the woman.   
  
He asked the manager to see the surveillance and was led to the back room. They only had 1 camera with a fisheye lens that captures the entirety of the small store. The camera was positioned right above the back room door, top corner of the ceiling. On the footage, to the left of the screen, we see a long, straight row of racks extending almost the length of the shop. In the middle of the shop are several circular racks of various styles. We can see the mother in the middle of the store going through one of those circular racks and Chrissy, in her little puffy jacket and beanie, faithfully attached at her mother’s hip. She was fiddling with what appears to be a rag doll. They were the only customers in the store and being it was a little past noon on a Tuesday, the entire mall itself had little traffic. At the very back of the footage is the front of the store. You can see the large windows viewing out into the mall and the wide open double door entrance. Then you see the woman with the large brim hat walk into the screen from the left. The footage is a bit distorted from that distance but the detective could see her figure stop as she is looking into the store as if window shopping and seeing something she likes. She begins to walk again and enters.   
The detective's eyes began to strain as he squinted trying to take in every detail. The woman started on the opposite side of the long rack of clothing on the left. Her hand jutted out to rustle the passing fabric as she made her way down the aisle. At one point you can see the mother momentarily turn and notice the woman and right back to sifting. As the woman casually made her way down the rack the detective’s instincts told him that something was off. The manager and the clerk could be seen discussing something in the far right corner, not paying attention. But if they did, like the detective was now, they would’ve seen that the woman was not there to shop at all.  
The woman’s gaze remained on her victims no matter where she moved to and that was creepy in itself but there was something about the way she moved that was so strange. So…fluid. Her legs were walking but something felt disconnected in the motion. Like she was superimposed into the footage.   
  
The detective watched with bated breath as she moved closer to the camera. He could see the lower half of her face, weathered with wrinkles. A smoker possibly. At this angle you can see that she is very gaunt. Soon he was looking directly at the top of her large brim hat as she rounded the end of the long rack and began walking down the other side. Towards her intended target.  
  
As the old woman neared them, she turned her head back to the clothes so as to appear normal. When she was next to them she stopped. A 5 foot gap separated the old woman’s back and Chrissy. The mother was still sifting with her back to the woman as well. But, Chrissy, who appeared to be holding onto the belt loop of her mother’s jeans, had taken notice of the old woman.   
  
The large brim hat slowly turned towards Chrissy. And when I say turning, I mean just her head. Her body remained facing the clothes rack, arms still pretending to sift through it. And the hat kept turning until it was at a most unnatural, neck breaking degree. It finally stopped when her fucken head was completely backwards and looking directly down at the child. In one quick motion her body whipped around and immediately knelt down to the child’s height. They’re now face to face. The woman’s right hand reaches out as if to ask for a handshake. Chrissy doesn’t move. The woman, with her left hand, then takes off her sunglasses. That’s when Chrissy, as if in recognition, slipped her finger out of her mother’s belt loop and took a step towards the woman, taking her hand. The woman stood upright, placed her sunglasses back on and they walked out with Chrissy.   
  
The detective took a sudden gulp of air. He had completely forgotten to breathe. Regardless there was no way to gather himself from what he just saw. He was a man that dealt with facts and now his reality was practically shot to shit. Unless he could explain this.  
  
He comes out of the back room, piecing his brain back together. He approaches the store employee that saw them leave. He had her re-enact the scene. The girl, pretending to hold an invisible child’s hand, walked at a normal pace out of the store and turned left. The detective started counting to 20. He would then run outside and tell the employee to stop. He walked towards her panning around to find an escape, an exit of any sort. But there was nothing.  
  
The detective stood in the middle of the semi busy mall scratching his head in frustration. A teenage girl working a toy kiosk was eyeing him. She noticed how flustered he looked. Their eyes met and the detective walked over revealing his badge. He asked if she saw a woman with a large brim hat walking with a 5 year old girl earlier at 12:15. She said she hadn’t because she would’ve been at the lunch court anyhow.   
  
As she was answering she saw pure alarm jump into his eyes. It scared her and she moved away from from him. A realization had popped into his head. He suddenly steps a few feet back, “Where the fuck was this kiosk in camera 2? This was a blindspot."   
The detective's eyes landed on a basket of stuffed animals for sale, and laying amongst them, out of place, was a worn out rag-doll. Then he saw the 2 door compartment below. Made to store inventory. Big enough for a 5 year old to hide in. He knelt down and grabbed the handles. His heartbeat was now thumping in his ears. He opened it and found himself paralyzed.   
The teenage girl walked around, her curiosity got the best of her. She looked over the detectives shoulders and let out a piercing scream. The body of 5 year old Chrissy was laying inside. Pale and cold to the touch. With a large brim summer hat resting on top of her. A crowd began to gather. The detective knew he had to control the crime scene. He began ordering the people to step back as he made the call to his men. He was in the process of dialing for forensics when he heard a little voice ask, “What’s going on?” He turned around and was literally almost scared to death. Chrissy was sitting upright and looking directly at him. She was alive. But, there was something about her eyes. There was darkness around them. Contrasted even more by her pale skin. Maybe that’s just how she looked. But, those eyes were vacant, cold, expressionless. There was something wrong. Hell there was something wrong about this whole fucken situation. His men arrived to help disperse the onlookers. Chrissy’s overjoyed mother would follow shortly. She hugged her baby and cried. Chrissy’s reaction remained muted. The detective stole a quick glance at the 2. He was met again with Chrissy’s dead eyes and he immediately looked away.   
They never caught the woman.  
  
A week later the detective is in his living room. Seemingly going mad. Surveillance footage playing over and over again on his television: The clip of the woman in the hat and Chrissy walking away and disappearing in the top right corner of the screen. 20 seconds later of course we have a frantic mother rush out screaming her daughters name to no avail. If you stay on the mother’s camera you will see a few people come to her aid.  
The detective has gone over this footage countless times. What the hell did the woman do to Chrissy in the blindspot?   
His gut was telling him something that his brain had yet to put together. He rewound and watched for the 50th time. Then the 51st. Then…his brain finally connected something. When the mother comes out and screams, 2 employees from the clothing store are first to come assist her. 3 seconds later a young couple pushing a stroller enters the frame from the left and stops to see what was the matter. 10 seconds after that a young woman enters from the right. This is where he paused the video. He stared at the woman that had just come into frame to offer her assistance. Why did she look out of place? And of course it’s always the easiest answer that sometimes takes so long to see. No shopping bags. No purse. This was not a woman that came to shop. And lastly, it was the middle of winter and all she had on was a dark dress. What the fuck. She would exit the screen to the left shortly after.   
The resolution was poor but he scrutinized every pixel of the woman while she was on screen. He strained his eyes until they watered and finally saw it. That disconnected walk leaving the screen.   
  
His reality really was being shot to shit. He needed a reality check.  
He picks up his phone and calls the mother to get an update on Chrissy. When the mother hears his voice she immediately breaks down. She confesses that she doesn’t think it's her Chrissy that she had brought home. “It’s some…thing that just observes. Her eyes when they look at me, I doesn’t feel like she even knows I’m her mother. She has these dark circles around her eyes that were never there before and that just get darker everyday. It’s like something had taken my Chrissy and left me with a shell.”  
When they hung up he sat down with his head in his hands.  
“What the hell happened in that blindspot?”  
Then a woman’s voice whispers in her ear and startles him to the very core.   
“You’re old. Not much I can take but I don’t like nosy people.”  
  
The detective is left sitting in his living room. The colors of life drained and dark circles began to grow around his eyes. He breathes, he mimics life, but she took the remainder.
