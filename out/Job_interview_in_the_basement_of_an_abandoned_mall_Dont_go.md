I’ve been unemployed for a while. The kind of “a while” that makes you start applying for jobs you’re not qualified for, jobs you don’t want, jobs that seem made-up. Anything that pays. Anything that gets you out of your head.

That’s how I ended up here.

It was around 2:30 AM, and I couldn’t sleep—again—so I started mindlessly scrolling through job boards and local gigs. Most of them were the usual crap: MLM scams, unpaid “internships,” weird delivery jobs that required a passport for some reason.

Then I saw it.

*Seeking one candidate for a position that will change everything. No experience necessary. Must be willing to commit to something larger than yourself.*

No company name. No contact info. Just a link to a form.

I don’t even remember filling it out. Honestly, I thought it was a prank. But the next morning, there was an email in my inbox:

*Congratulations. You’ve been selected for an interview. Report to the sub-basement of Ridgewood Galleria. Thursday, 5:00 PM sharp. Wear business attire. Do not bring anyone with you. This is your final opportunity.*

Ridgewood Galleria is practically a ghost town. It was big in the ’90s, but most of it’s been abandoned for years. There’s still a nail salon, a vape store, and one of those sad discount clothing places that sells irregular socks and off-brand cologne. That’s it.

The sub-basement part threw me. I didn’t even know there *was* a basement, let alone a “sub.” But like I said—I was desperate. I borrowed a wrinkled button-up shirt from my roommate, printed a résumé I knew they wouldn’t read, and showed up a few minutes early.

The mall was almost empty. Just that weird hum of artificial light and old pop music echoing through dead stores. I followed the instructions from the email:

Down the main hall. Past the food court. Through the Employees Only door behind the old Wet Seal. The hallway smelled like mildew and forgotten things. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, flickering every few seconds like they were fighting to stay alive. I kept going.

Down a concrete stairwell. Past one landing. Then another. Then a third. There were signs taped to the walls, printed on old yellowed paper. They said things like:

*The Foundation is Listening.*  
*Don’t look behind you between levels.*  
*All who descend must bleed.*

That’s when I should’ve turned around. That’s when any sane person would’ve turned around.

But I didn’t.

At the bottom of the stairs, there was a single wooden door. No knob. Just a faded brass plate that read: *Candidates Only.*

The second I stepped toward it, it opened on its own. The room inside was circular. Lit by red overhead bulbs that cast everything in a sick, pulsing glow. The air was heavy—humid, like being inside a lung. The walls were raw concrete, wet in places. In the center of the room stood a large black stone slab, rough and veined with something that looked… almost alive. Like capillaries, or vines, or both.

Three people sat at a long table against the far wall. They wore matching charcoal-gray suits. Their skin looked *off*. Too smooth, too tight across their cheekbones, like mannequins dusted with foundation. Their hair didn’t move. Their eyes didn’t blink.

No introductions. No smiles.

One of them, the one in the middle, stood and said they had reviewed my materials. I was confused as hell cause I hadn’t submitted anything except my name and email. Then the one on the left just up and told me I was hired. And the person sitting on the right told me to step forward and place my hand on the altar.

I laughed. Nervous. And asked if they were serious. Didn’t they want to ask me anything? But the person in the middle cut me off and said there wouldn’t be any questions, only “the mark.”

I didn’t move. The room darkened around me. Not gradually. More like someone had reached into the air and *turned down the volume of light itself*. The red bulbs dimmed, and the concrete seemed to stretch inward. The air got thicker. I felt pressure in my ears, like I was changing altitude.

That word—marked—slammed into me like a cold wave.

I stepped forward. Embedded in the slab was a knife. Not modern. Curved. Bronze or copper, stained with something too dark to be rust. I wrapped my fingers around the handle. It felt *warm*. I pricked my palm. Just a quick slice. A few drops of blood fell onto the stone.

They didn’t drip. They *sank in*. The slab pulsed. The walls seemed to *breathe*. The red lights flared, then dimmed again. I heard a sound, low and humming—*not in the air, but in my chest*. Like a tuning fork inside my bones.

And then… a word. Not spoken, not heard, but felt:

*ACCEPTED.*

The lights flickered again. I blinked—and the slab was clean. Dry. Like I’d never touched it. The three figures stood together. The middle one approached and handed me a red folder. They spoke in unison. It was something like:

“Your job begins at dawn.   
Do not speak of this.  
Do not deviate from the path.  
Do not attempt to quit.”

They said it like a prayer. Or a warning. Maybe it was both.

A door I hadn’t noticed before—gray metal with a glowing green EXIT sign above it—creaked open behind me. The hallway beyond was dark, but familiar. I walked through it like a sleepwalker. I don’t remember how I got home. I woke up the next morning in my bed. Fully dressed. 

The red folder was on my nightstand.

At first, I thought maybe I’d dreamed the whole thing. The interview. The slab. The blood. All of it. My palm ached, but when I looked—no cut. No scar. Just clean, unbroken skin.

But the folder was still there. Inside:

* A plastic ID badge with no name or company—just a barcode and a blurry photo of me I don’t remember taking.
* A printed schedule. My first “shift” was that night, listed as:

*TASK: Observe.*  
*LOCATION: Ridgewood Galleria – Food Court.*  
*TIME: 1:11 AM – 4:04 AM.*  


Then a list of rules—fifteen of them. Here are the ones that I can remember off the top of my head:

1. *Enter through the service door behind Wet Seal.*
2. *Do not speak to anyone who speaks first.*
3. *If you see your reflection walking independently of your actions, do not engage.*
4. *If you hear footsteps behind you, keep walking.*
5. *Never eat mall food.*
6. *When working the 3 AM shift, no matter what happens remain completely still between 3:33 and 3:44 AM.*
7. *You cannot quit. You can only be replaced.*  

I almost didn’t go. But when I tried to throw the badge away, my kitchen lights shorted out and all the faucets in the apartment turned on at once. Water gushing, no explanation. My phone screen flickered and displayed only one word:

*BOUND.*

So yeah, I went.

The mall was worse at night. The silence was suffocating. The air smelled like rot and plastic and something older—like damp stone and rusty iron. I slipped in through the service entrance and found my way to the food court.

Everything was exactly as I remembered… except the mannequins.

There were mannequins scattered across the tables. Not mall mannequins—no makeup, no smiles. These were blank, genderless, wrapped in yellowing plastic, with red string crisscrossed around their torsos and faces. Each one had a number written in marker across the chest.

They were arranged like they were eating. Some sat upright. Some slumped over trays of decayed, long-rotted food. One had a straw jammed through its plastic lips and into a spilled milkshake that smelled like vinegar.

At exactly 1:11 AM, the lights dimmed.

And the mannequins moved. 

Not all at once. Just little things. A head tilt here. A hand twitch there. One slowly turned to face me. Another lifted a finger and *pointed directly at my chest.*

My heart was hammering. My hands were sweating. I looked at the badge. The barcode glowed faintly green. I kept standing. Kept watching. Just like the folder said.

After what felt like days, the clock on my phone finally ticked to 2:04 AM. The lights blinked back to full brightness and the mannequins were back in their original positions. I left without looking back.

That was my first shift. I’ve had six more since then. Each one is stranger. Harder to explain. Harder to remember.

One night I had to sit in the old Claire’s and listen to the sound of something breathing behind the pierced-ear display. Another night, I had to follow a woman in a janitor uniform around the mall in silence. When she stopped and turned, she had my face—but older, tired, and missing a tooth or two.

Last night, my task was to stand still from 3:33 to 3:44 AM in the central atrium. I did. I didn’t move an inch. Not even when the floor beneath me opened like a mouth and whispered in a language I shouldn’t understand, but somehow did.

I don’t sleep much now. When I do, I dream of escalators that lead nowhere, elevators full of mirrors, and parking lots that stretch into the sky. My calendar no longer matches real days. I looked at my phone this morning and it said “Day Seven of the Mall.”

I think I’m changing. I think I’ve already changed. 

There’s something beneath Ridgewood Galleria. I know it. I can feel it. It's almost like... it's all I can feel. It's not a company. Not a cult. But a presence. A hunger. 

And we’re the employees it feeds through.

I tried to quit last night. I walked into the one store still open—an old Foot Locker—sat down at the counter, and told the man behind it that I wasn’t doing this anymore.

He didn’t look up. He just said:

“Quitting is a privilege for the living.”

Tonight’s shift says:

*TASK: Cross Over.*  
*TIME: 2:22 AM – ∞*

I don’t think I’m coming back.

If you see a posting like the one I answered—don’t click it.

If you’ve already clicked it—don’t go.

And if you’ve already gone?

God help you. Because the mall already knows your name.
