I’m not scared of spiders. After everything that happened, somehow, I’m still not scared of spiders. I wouldn’t wanna be chummy with one or keep a few as pets. If one was climbing on me, I would casually swipe it away, so as to avoid being bit. But I’m not scared of spiders.



I only hate them. Acute. Vengeful. Hate.



Five years ago I lived in the basement of a house originally built when lamps were fueled by whale oil. I wouldn’t be surprised if the people who built the house were drinking the stuff too. Over time, as technology advanced, the “improvements” to the house only got worse: plumbing most likely organized by a toddler, wiring that was probably installed by a pyromaniac, and insulation that’s… 

I’m kidding, there was no insulation.

If there had been insulation, there wouldn’t have been ants in my room. If there hadn’t been ants in my room, there wouldn’t have been spiders in my room. If there hadn’t been spiders in my room, I’d be talking about plans for a kid with my fiancé.

Though, at the time, I didn’t really mind the spiders. As long as ants weren’t congregating around my trash can looking for dried Dr. Pepper and Chik-Fil-A waffle fry crumbs, the spiders could do whatever they damn well pleased.

One day, I woke up with a spider bite on my chest, near my lower rib. Unsurprisingly, “damn well pleased” occasionally meant random spider bites on my body. It didn’t really bother me that much. Usually I wouldn’t notice bites until I bumped them on a doorway or scratched one after feeling a bit itchy in the general area, but this one stung immediately. I lived in southern Colorado, which meant the only lethal spiders are Brown Recluses,  (which are exceedingly rare), and Black Widows. But I had only ever seen one black widow, and removed her quickly. Through bleary eyes I calculated the potential chances I had been bitten by something lethal, and eventually landed on, “We’ll wait and see if the pain gets worse.”

That same day, I had a chiropractor’s appointment, and just so happened to be fifteen seconds from running late for it. I threw on my shirt, and rushed out to the door without giving much more thought to the bite.

The details of my employment aren’t important, except for the fact I spent a lot of time sitting at a desk. With all that time stuck in a chair, I often found myself teetering on the proverbial edge of chronic back pain (hence, the chiropractor). Today was, hopefully, going to be the end of my weekly visits.  While the attention was necessary, my bank account was beginning to look a little light. After barely making it on time to my appointment, the chiropractor performed a few spinal adjustments and then suggested X-rays to see how my back looked. The strange thing is, when he took the X-rays, I felt a sharp burning sensation in my chest. It was like being lightly jabbed with a two by four wrapped in sand paper. But it went  as quickly as it came with only a brief moment at the interim. There were a few more photos, but the pain failed to return. I chalked it up to inconvenient cramps, and thought nothing else of it.

The results showed a marvelously straight spine. My chiropractor suggested I start coming in only once every few months and then sent me home.

When I got back, I looked at the bite again. That morning it had been a fiery red mark on my ribs, but now, it had almost completely disappeared. I could have sworn I had felt a strange tingling sensation on the drive home, like sand rubbing across my ribcage, but I decided it was just an illusion caused by my anxiety over the spider bite being something more serious. I worked a little more and went to sleep.

I then had one week of normality. A week which subsisted almost entirely of sitting at my computer, working, or lamely attempting to get some gains at the gym. It was the first few weeks of January, and like every other loser, I was making another march towards fitness. I had no clue how lifting weights worked, so building muscle was tough, but I enjoyed the cardio. With all the time I spent sitting down, it was relieving to have an opportunity to run until my lungs were ready to explode.

I was really beginning to feel like I had gotten my life together. 

I should have done more.

The sand feeling came and went. But instead it would only be one grain, if anything at all. Any normal person, including myself, would have taken the feeling as something akin to feeling a strange itch that you think nothing else of after having scratched it, and scratch I did.

At the end of that week, the first symptom revealed itself.

I felt like I had swallowed a pound of dust. I drank some water in hopes the feeling would subside, but it didn’t do much.

I poured a bowl of cereal, Cap’n Crunch (oops all berries), poured some milk, scooped a hearty spoonful into my mouth, and nearly spat them across my dining table. What should have been a pleasant berry mix of my favorite cereal, instead tasted unsettlingly off. I swallowed the spoonful, hoping it was just because I was still groggy, and shoveled another into my mouth. But the same sensation returned. It was like someone had flaked rust off of an old pan into my bowl of cereal.

I checked the milk, but the best by date proclaimed my milk was far from going sour. So my next guess was to see if my cereal had gone bad, but the box stated I had about 4 years until I should suspect a funky taste.

Usually I would think my grogginess had brought my tongue to feel the taste of the spoon, rather than the cereal, and maybe my spoons were starting to get a little old. But here’s the thing: I rarely do my dishes. Once I run out of plates and bowls, I resort to buying two or three boxes of disposable dishware at Target before I’m bothered to do my own dishes. So this day’s spoon had come fresh out of a box branded “Up&Up”. I checked my temperature, but I was fine. I grew nervous at what was happening to me.

As a cold chill ran down my spine, grains of sand rolled up my ribcage.

I called my boss, and told him I wasn’t feeling well, and needed the day off from work. My boss obliged, and told me to get well soon. It was odd for me to call in sick, and luckily, with the new year, my sick days hadn’t been used yet. I called out for a whole week, hoping it would give me enough time to recover. After calling my boss, I scheduled a checkup. I didn’t know what exactly was going on, and nothing screamed medical emergency, so my appointment was scheduled for the following week.

With a week of no work, and nothing else to do with my time, I decided to hit the gym. I wasn’t debilitated — I just had a sore throat, metallic taste in my mouth, and a weird scratchy feeling on my ribs. Why not?

The metallic taste never went away, but my throat got better with the help of cough drops, and whatever was going on with my ribcage didn’t return for the rest of the day. But I soon learned these were the least of my issues.

I went to bed early after perusing random tv shows and playing shitty games on my phone. After sleeping for a whole nine hours, I got up and went for a jog early that morning.

It was honestly beautiful. I had chosen an exceptionally long path and put on a podcast to listen to while I ran. The morning dew mixed with light fog gave a cinematic tranquility as it melded with the cerulean sky. I barely even cared the protein bar I had eaten tasted kinda like chocolate almond tin foil. I, for the first time since I started,  truly felt eager to work out. I planned to watch the sun rise while I jogged, I even considered giving it a light smile and a wave for having blessed me with an excellent morning.

Instead I watched it crest over the toes of my sneakers while I laid flat on my back in the grass beside the path. Gasping desperately for air.

I had barely made it a mile before I was doubled over, heaving, and feeling like I might throw up. The stitches in my side barely covered the tingly feeling running from the right side of my pectorals, to just below my sternum. I ripped my shirt off to see what it was, but through the heavy breathing, and beads of sweat dripping down my body, I could see nothing there. Beside the rise and fall of my chest looking weirdly uneven as my lungs filled with air. That was when I collapsed on the ground, and waited until I had enough oxygen to make the sad trek back home. I also flipped off the sun.

I got home, and tried to piece together the events of the last few days into anything rational. Everything on google told me the metallic taste was probably poor oral hygiene, or a plain old sinus infection. The sore throat bore the same results. Chances were the sudden exhaustion would point to the same potential ailments as well, besides the dental hygiene thing. It begged the question: why did I still not have a temperature?

I gave up playing Internet Doctor when searches on the tingly feeling in my chest brought back results saying I was dying of heart failure or a pinched nerve. I had only been to the chiropractor a few days prior, so it wasn’t a pinched nerve, and I was twenty-freaking-five, so it *definitely* wasn’t heart failure. I watched tv for the rest of the day.

Nothing new came about for the next few days, but the already present side effects failed to wane. I did eventually get to see what the source of the tingling sensation was, but by now I kinda wish it was just heart failure.

I had just finished taking a shower. I wrapped a towel around my waist and began shaving when I felt it. Like the tip of a pen being dragged across my hip bone. I ripped the towel off and finally got my first glimpse at what was happening to me.

It was fast, and at the time I thought it was just my imagination. A small bump, about an eighth of an inch around, rolling across my hip. The initial shock gave the bump enough time to disappear around to my back, and after scouring my ass in the mirror for quite some time, the bump was no longer visible.

The day of my doctor’s visit finally arrived. I could finally get an answer to all of this. I jumped out of bed with a spring in my step, opened the bathroom door to brush my teeth, and screamed at the sight of my eyes and skin: a sickly yellow hue.

Jaundice.

Like they had nothing else to hide anymore, hundreds of tiny bumps flowed from my sternum and through my entire body. The pain was unbearable, like I was being dragged across the pavement, stomach down. I bent over the bathroom sink, already feeling a thick wave of empty stomach bile erupting from my throat.

I was eating less and less. The metallic taste to everything I put in my mouth made it hard for me to feel hungry enough for the effort. There were no chunks in the sink, only a syrupy, yellowish liquid. Like my own body had finally realized it needed to dispel whatever was inside me, but had nothing to show for its efforts.

I briefly considered taking matters into my own hands. I could just cut myself open instead of waiting for a doctor, but rational thinking got the better of me, and I drove to the clinic with as fast as I could legally muster. I don’t know if it was my own frightened panic, but it felt as though the pain never went away the whole time I drove.

A hundred grains of sand, grinding on my chest. A thousand tiny pricks, stabbing into my waist. Millions of them, inside me, burrowing, scurrying, harboring… inside me.

I honestly don’t remember much of my visit with the doctor. I told him everything that had happened to me, and how I desperately needed help, all of which he believed. I was taken to a hospital to get X-rays, but after only one picture I begged them to stop.

That one flash of radioactive waves sent the things inside me into a frenzy. The light scrapes, and scattered tingles became a constant wave of agonizing suffering. I can only imagine what the nurses saw when they rushed to my aid at the sound of my pain. The horrified looks on their faces at the rapid writhing of my skin. Over my own wails, I could hear their screams of terror when, finally, one of the tiny bumps popped, and the small, white culprits made their identity known. How long did it take the nurses slack jaws to finally shut while they watched the frenzied arachnids spill from my shell and scurry about my tempestuous flesh? Soon after I heard their screams, I succumbed to the pain.

Even in my unconscious mind, the spindly creatures had found a way to haunt me. I could see them eating away at my body. Devouring my muscles, engorging upon my heart and brain, keeping me alive just to keep their gluttonous bowels satiated. I saw them leave my soul for last. Like the final course in their detestable feast. I would scream for them to stop, but my refrain only spurred their voracity forward as they tore my essence apart. I could hear them laughing.

I Could Hear Them Laughing

I finally awoke to the smell of hand sanitizer and dead skin. A nurse was beside me tending to some bag filled with something. She was surprised and happy to see that I was awake, and after some cursory tests to ensure my mental faculties had been fully restored, the doctor came in to inform me that after I had passed out, they rushed me into an emergency room to perform surgery.

“They were everywhere,” she continued, “feeding on you. You lost a lung, a kidney, your gallbladder, and liver. If you hadn’t been here sooner, you probably wouldn’t have made it more than a few days.”

We discussed what my life might look like from now on, but my mind never left what she told me about the spiders. It explained everything, really. I was the host for a mother’s brood. I was their form of survival. They were killing me so that they might live. 

After some more chit chat, the doctor left me to get some more rest and heal. Yet, as I lay, I couldn’t shake the strangest notion. The doctor said they had removed all the spiders, and then listed the organs I had lost to the beings once inside me. But I remember watching them spread across my body in the mirror. I saw where they went to feed next after consuming my liver.

I looked down to the blanket covering me in my hospital bed. I lifted the cover and looked at my gown. I raised my gown above my hips and beheld my testicles. 

The undulating sack was all I needed to see. 

The surgeon had not killed them all.
