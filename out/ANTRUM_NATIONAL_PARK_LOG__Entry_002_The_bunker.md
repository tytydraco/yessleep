Antrum National Park Log – Entry #002 0700 hours 

Filed by: [Redacted]

When I was younger, a friend of mine asked me a question that stuck with me. He said:

“So If you saw an alien or something.. and you knew it was real. would you tell anyone?”

I had to weigh up my options. If I told people, I would seem crazy — and not to mention, no one would believe me. But if I kept it silent, I would have to live knowing the universe isn’t as small as we’ve been taught. So I just said:

“The truth is out there.”

He stayed silent for a few seconds…

“You’re right ….If you did say something, you’d probably disappear like…” he hushed his voice and semi-whispered, “The Men in Black.”

Despite only being a teen, I remember the feeling that gave me. The idea that some omnipotent agency that doesn’t exist in the eyes of the public could make you just… go away. We have all heard about the government being shady, and whilst that is definitely true, I have never done anything to draw attention to myself — and being a government employee, looking the other way is just part of the job. 

You see I work at a national park. Not the kind of friendly, happy family type park you can see the sights at, but a strange  and unusal place. Theres a fog that lingers year round and despite how few people visit, our dissapearance rate is abnormally high. We get very few visitors.

The park isn’t uninteresting though It’s just isolated, we sit just inland from the labrador sea where we are surrounded by hundreds of miles of forests, winding rivers and abandoned mining towns. The only reason we even work here is due to “historical significance“ whatever that means. But in all honesty this is just where you get re-assigned to when you’ve messed up in another park and they want you to serve your sentence or … contract, away from the public. There’s only about 4 of us work here ? there is actually 6 people on the staff index but i have worked here for years and only met 3 others, they all claim to have believed I didn’t exist either until they met me after i discovered I was supposed to be staying in an old hut they call a “ranger station“ with a delightfully overbearing colleague who is now my room mate. His real name is Oscar but everyone calls him ozzy. He was reassigned here from arizona where he challenged a hiker to a PISTOL DUEL over littering. Littering is an issue but … A duel ?? Really? 

This may seem a bit frazzled right now, but I’m just trying to get my ideas down as I wait for Ozzy to get back from the night shift. This laptop I’m typing on used to be his, but after reading John Krakauer’s Into the Wild, he went full McCandless and generously donated his 2017 gaming rig. 

SOOO… I guess I’ll just start with what happened last week…

Ozzy and I woke up bright and early to walk the main trail of the park — a regular and somewhat tedious part of our job but totally essential for the tens of hikers that still make the journey despite the 30 or so sun-faded missing persons posters stapled to the welcome sign at the entrance of the park. That reminds me… I should really take those down again…

O: “You ready to go, dude? That sun ain’t getting any hotter,” he said, patting his sides as if to check his pockets.

“Uh, yeah. I’m just confused by this new map that Parks sent to us.” Parks being our affectionate pet name for the shady department running our little operation.

“Why? They give us the wrong one again? ‘Cause last time I was so lost I—”
I cut him off.

“No, man, it’s… well, just take a look.”

I handed him the worn-looking map (despite being apparently new), and he inspected it closely…

“Hmm, yeah, I see what you mean… wait its .. dated 1983????”

I stared back, confused.

“No, I mean… wait, really? No, what am I saying… bro, there’s about an extra 50 sq. miles on the map that says ‘Under Survey.’ The map in the museum has that whole area catalogued, and that’s from the ’50s — but nothing about this.”

Incredulous, he shrugged. “So?”

“Sooo I’m saying there’s about 50 sq. miles they just, what… forgot?”

Ever dismissively, he chirped, “Probably some big-wig, fat-cat park oligarch cartographer couldn’t be bothered to do his job so he just, I don’t know… left it like that?”

He had obviously realised as he blabbed away that it was, in fact, weird, and… getting through to Parks was basically impossible. Not only are we in a sort of signal deadzone but being the least popular park on the whole continent, made us fresh out of funding and attention from parks.  

O: “So what do we do?”

Standing and walking over to our table (an old door we have balanced upon two stacks of books), I placed the map down. “The main route passes here, just down a little ravine and then we can cross over here” pointing at the very edge of Under Survey, “that’s only like 4 miles off our regular round” I said with a hint of precaution in my voice. “So let’s, like… go there and, like… check it out… we could be in and out in an hour or two”

His eyes lit up, but I could tell he hid his excitement.
“Yeah, okay… sure. But don’t tell anyone else. I heard from Staley if you discover something new, like a creature or mountain or something… you get to name it…”

“That’s not how that works…”
He had already grabbed his pack and moved to the door, completely deaf to any protest to his musings I might have.

Leaving the shack — or hut or shanty or whatever it is — always feels like a blessing, as I really do love nature despite my disdain for this job. Ozzy does too. We could walk for hours in the woods, as we did on that day, and because he is taller, he carries the water and food. I navigate with the map and handle the boring or “nerd stuff,” as he calls it. Truly a dream team. And I was really enjoying the hike until we got to the point on the map that was Under Survey.

We had travelled off the main path, and after crossing a few areas of what appeared to be old logging trails and then natural meadows, we summitted a small hill. Pointing down the ridge at the area,
“Look, there it is.”

He put his hands on his hips and stood next to me, inspecting the landscape —
“Ahh, look at it… untouched, unexplored… totally definitely not haunted,” Ozzy said with an infuriatingly proud grin, like we were about to crack open an Egyptian sarcophagus instead of entering an area the federal government apparently accidentally erased from every map post-1983.

And yet, there it was. Sprawling pines swaying like they were whispering secrets to each other, shadows stretching wrong for the time of day — like the sun had no jurisdiction here. The entire section of forest below us didn’t just look different — it felt different. the wind was silent and

Naturally, Ozzy cracked a beer.

“Bro… are you serious??”

“What? It’s not like we wear bodycams… well, not after what happened with those…”

“Yes. I know what happened. We don’t have to go over this again. Dude, you know you can’t drink on shift.”

“So? Staley does it all the time.”

“Yes, and Staley also drinks his own piss on a full moon ‘cause he thinks it will make him immortal.”

He winced and looked twice at his beer, deciding to still sip at it before grinning.

“So I guess we are setting up here for a rest then…”

“Yeah, dude, I need a relax sesh ASAP.”

We both found a tree to rest against, with our packs acting as a sort of poor man’s pillow. It was peaceful. Oz flicked through his faded copy of Into the Wild and hummed to himself, nursing a beer, and I stared up at the branches of the pines swaying in the breeze. It was mild — summer was just starting — and every breath of air in my lungs felt… refreshing. Putting my hands behind my head and laying back, I felt the soreness from the hike turn into… warmth. My muscles felt soft, and the hard ground and pack I laid on were like a soft down bed. I hadn’t felt a down bed in years. It was moments like these I’d come to appreciate most. Despite never feeling at home on the ex-military cot I tossed and turned on every night without fail, never feeling warm or clean. It was moments like these… that cemented my notion that nature truly is my home.

It was only a few minutes later I felt it… a single cold drop of water, right in the centre of my forehead. In an instant, my relaxation ended.
“Ugh… typical,” I groaned to myself, having been torn from my bliss.

“What, dude? It’s just a bit of water. I’ve never seen a fish complain about water… but they hate being dry.”

I’m convinced he just makes up sayings to annoy me, but I also cannot rule out he genuinely thinks it’s real.

“What are you talking about? How would you know if the fish was complaining?”

He held up his book.
“When you're at one with nature… you can see what an animal is thinking just by the look in its eye.”
He clearly is either vastly misinterpreting the book that may as well be glued to his hands, or he is just not reading it… maybe he swapped the cover for one of his more niche book choices…

My deadpan expression wasn’t enough to sway him toward reality.

“You are telling me if we saw an animal right now… you’d know what it was thinking?”

“Yes, dude. Any animal at all.”
He stood, searching for one to prove his point — and almost immediately, he spotted one.

“Look, there — a, uh… what is that? A deer or… wait, what the hell?”
His expression quickly changed from enthused to downright scared. I stood to join him, following his gaze to a sort of… well, I guess it did look like a deer. Or like a big dog? Not really wolf-like. More… sort of thin. Like a deer-dog, uh, hybrid?

I slowly turned to face him.
“Oz… what the hell is that thing?”

He stared at it, wide-eyed.
“I know this is going to sound bad, but hear me out… we go capture it using you as bait. Then I use my oneness with nature to read its mind. We catalog it as a new scientific being — THEN I can name it! Like Christopher Columbus himself.”

“Firstly… Columbus?? Then two key things you brushed over there. One: we have no idea what it even is — I mean, what if it’s dangerous? Secondly: you said bait, which implies you know it’s dangerous. So no. You’ll have to use your telekinesis on a squirrel or something.”

The singular drop of rain had become a lingering shower. The trees were breaking most of the downpour, but without finding shelter or gearing up, it looked like a storm was headed in that would have us swimming in minutes.

He was already getting his raingear out of his pack before I thought to suggest it.
“Look, dude, we are going after that thing no matter how long it takes. We can’t split up… well, not after…”

“YES, I remember what happened. I just really don’t think it’s a good idea chasing a mysterious organism neither of us can identify.. in the rain, in a part of the park we didn’t even know existed until seemingly today.”

“Would this change your mind?”
He extended his arm, holding a single can of warm beer. I shifted my gaze from the can up to him, then to the can, and back up.



Sighing ,“Fine.”


Snatching the rare delicacy from his oversized palm, “But for the record, I don’t like this at all and I just know — I know — you’re going to pull some move that’s… I… let’s just go.”

So we headed off to follow the dogdeer thing, and it wasn’t long before Ozzy spotted a sort of deer trail — like a thin path through the underbrush — and we decided following it was our best bet at claiming this new species as our own. We chatted about potential names. Oz suggested Waheela, like the old Native tale, but as I reminded him, that was just like a big wolf in the Northwest Territories — not some weird skinny elk or whatever… and it already existed, so not really a new creature.

It had been about 30 minutes or so before I asked him:

“Uh, dude… you know, I am looking at this map and… really, I’m just guessing where we are. Like, I have no idea where we really are.”

He looked confused.
“So? We’re on a path. We’ll just follow it back the way we came… we cannot go wrong.”

I should’ve known we couldn’t get away with a statement like that. It was almost like he tempted fate. Before us was a crossroads of sorts — three paths that intersected in a sort of peace symbol shape. We stood in silence.

“So, uh, good time to head back, right man? The rain is borderline monsoon level now and I don’t know about you, but… I do not feel safe right now…”

He inspected the paths…

“Hmmm… we could… we could… orrrrrr split up and look for clues?”

“Split up??? This is not Scooby-Doo, man. If I get lost, I’m going to die of exposure — not stumble across a man in a werewolf costume. Anyway, you just said like 20 minutes ago we CAN’T split up.”

“Fortune favours the brave, man,” pulling out his pistol and waving it about dangerously.

“WOAH… careful, dude. I wondered how long that would take you.”

He lowered it sheepishly, holding it like it might explode if looked at wrong.

“Okay, okay, you’re right,” he said, stuffing the pistol back into his holster like a guilty kid hiding candy. “No splitting up. But hear me out... what if... the crossroads only seems like a crossroads?”

I blinked at him slowly. “What?”

“Like, what if this is a trick, man. Like, psychological. The forest is testing us.”

“The forest is testing us.”

“Yeah,” he said, nodding. “Like, it wants us to panic and make the wrong decision so it can, like... consume us.”

“Ozzy,” I sighed. “It’s three dirt paths and some wet trees. It’s not the Labyrinth.”

“Dude, you’re not hearing me. Nature’s like... got layers. Like onions. Or parfaits. Except instead of sweetness at the bottom, it’s, like... existential dread.”

“I need you to understand how violently none of what you’re saying makes sense.”

“No no, think about it,” he said, stepping back with his hands raised like he was revealing the climax of a bad magic trick. “We came to a place that wasn’t on any current map. We saw a creature that isn’t in any book. And now? Boom. Mysterious crossroads. That’s not coincidence, bro. That’s... intention.”

“Oz. I’m cold, I’m wet, I’m rapidly losing patience, and your logic is making me think you ate a brownie from staleys fridge .”

He paused, processing. Then grinned. “So what you’re saying is... I’m blowing your mind.”

“I’m saying if the forest is testing us, it’s specifically testing my will to not strangle you with your own shoelaces.”

He checked his boots. “Joke’s on you, I’m wearing Velcro. have done since i was 12 years old. nothing beats the cro”

I stared blankly at him.

“Anyway,” he continued, waving his hand vaguely at the forked paths, “this whole thing? It’s a metaphor.”

“Please don’t.”

“It is! A metaphor for choice, bro. Like, life has all these routes, and we think we’re making decisions, but maybe the destination’s always been the same.”

“I swear if you start talking about destiny again I’m going to sit down and cry into the mud.”

He ignored me completely, arms spread like a prophet. “And maybe, just maybe, the right path isn’t about where it leads, but who you’re with on the way.”

“Ozzy.”

“Yeah?”

“We are very much lost in a storm following a probably-cursed deer-dog, and you’re doing slam poetry about friendship at a three-way fork in the woods.”

He gave me a very serious nod. “Which means we’re exactly where we’re meant to be.”

I exhaled so hard I nearly deflated. “Okay. Fine. Then choose one.”

“What?”

“Choose a path. You're the spiritual forest whisperer. Enlighten me.”

He frowned like I’d just asked him to pick a favorite child. “Okay okay okay… give me a sec. I gotta feel it out.”

And then he did what I can only describe as a sort of stoned interpretive dance — standing still with his arms raised slightly like he was waiting for the forest to join in.

“Ozzy.”

“Shhh. I’m listening.”

I whispered “To what?”

He whispered back “The vibes.”

I looked down at my soaked boots, then back up at him still whispering,“What do the vibes say?”

He pointed left. “That one!”

“Why?”

He shrugged. “It smells friendlier.”

“Smells... okay. Great. Perfect.” I shook my head. “Let’s take the friendly-smelling cursed trail and die quietly then.”

“Hey, worse ways to go,” he said, adjusting his pack and cracking his neck. “You ever think about being reborn as a mushroom?”

“I’m not entertaining that question.”

“I feel like I’d be a fun mushroom. Like, the kind that glows in the dark and gives people weird dreams.”

I turned and started walking down the chosen path. “If you get reincarnated as a mushroom, I’m putting a warning sign next to your stump.”

“You’d do that for me?”

“Only so no one licks you and sees God by accident.”

“Aw, you do care.”

“Please stop talking.”

we wandered then. following the path that got progressively more intense. The trees seemed to reach down and grab at us and not to mention they got strangely dense as if arranged rather than sprouted from the earth naturally, even the pine needles felt sharper. I could see Oz feathering the holster… any excuse to take pot shots at a poor defenseless animal and he’d take it because of “self defense“ but despite the ever narrowing, worsening path he inisited the trail had “deerdog vibes“ even assuring me he was latched onto its scent like a bloodhound, but despite my faithful hound guiding me forward ready to blast a potentially aincient being of supernatural origin i couldnt shake the feeling that the rain was just too intense, every step was a deep squelch of mud and my feet were sinking deeper and deeper into the earth with each minute i hesitated but eventually had to adress it.

“Dude this is just too intense, forget the deerdog we are already lost we have to find shelter..“

“I prefer the term ‘baptism by mud,’” Ozzy declared as he trudged infront of me, absolutely drenched and still trying to spin our near-death experience into some kind of spiritual rebirth.

I ignored him. My teeth were chattering, and the forest had officially crossed the line from “mysteriously quiet” to “actively hostile.” Even the birds had stopped pretending to exist.

We were moving on instinct at that point. Or maybe desperation. Probably both. The path—or what used to resemble a path—had dissolved into a slurry of leaves and mud. I kept scanning for anything that looked like shelter: a cave, an outcropping, hell, even a log I could lay under.

But then I saw it.

At first, it just looked like a big rock in the soil. A weird metal scar in the moss. I almost walked right past it—until Ozzy slipped and nearly face-planted it.

“Whoa, bro, watch it—” It make a loud clang “Wait… what the hell is this?”

He knelt down, brushing away layers of damp leaves and revealing a solid hatch. Steel. Old. Weathered like a veteran smoker. It had a faded radiation symbol on it and a padlock that had long since given up the will to be locked.

My stomach dropped.

“No way,” I said, crouching beside him. “Is this…?”

“Dude,” he whispered with reverence, “this is some Cold War-level G.I. Joe mk ultra sht*.”

The rain intensified, as if the forest was mad we’d found it. Ozzy didn’t wait for a second opinion. The hatch groaned as he levered it open with the assitance of a nearby log, it creaked open with the most haunted hinge sound I’ve ever heard in my entire life.

He poked his head down first.

“Smells like old books …. and uhh dust,” he reported cheerfully. “just like my old apartment in AZ”

“for the record if we come out here irradiated its your fault” 

“Bro, that’s vintage radiation. Practically harmless, you can actually swim in a reactor pool you know that?? i got a buddy did it at a plant in pheonix, said after that he grew 3 inches.”

I decided not to bite on that obvious lie. He dropped down into the darkness with a hollow thud and I followed with the hatch loudly falling shut behind me. At the time it seemed insignificant but that hatch had to have weighed 200lbs, we barely got it open with a good solid stance and the both of us levering it open, climbing back up that ladder in the dark and attempting to push it single handed would have been almost impossible…. Which we later found out it was. But nevertheless I reluctantly, slid down the rusted ladder and landed on a cold concrete floor, following my evil twin of a co worker. 

We clicked on our flashlights and scanned the enteryway

The bunker was… insane.

Old gear stacked in corners. Dusty control panels with flickering bulbs. A cracked monitor still glowing faintly like it hadn’t accepted the Cold War was over. It was like time had paused somewhere around Reagan-era paranoia and just… stayed.  Food cans stacked like trophies. Old military posters peeling off the walls. A cot in the corner with an ancient sleeping bag. 

But most glaring was a huge red bulkhead on the far wall opposite the control panel.

Big. Red. Aggressively red. Like it had been painted with blood. Everything about this place screamed “bad idea!” in my head. The letters were huge—CAUTION - prevent your own death do not proceed unless TAA is under way.

It was the kind of warning that wasn’t just for show. Not your average “watch your step” or “floor slippery when wet” sign. This was do not go through this door unless reality has already broken down into anarchy level of serious.

Ozzy, naturally, was already halfway across the room before I even finished reading it.

“Nope,” I said, standing up and practically diving to intercept him. “No. Nonononono. Absolutely not. Did you read that? It literally says prevent your own death. That’s not subtle.”

He squinted at the text, brow furrowed like he was trying to decode a foreign language—or like someone trying to read an eye chart stoned out of their mind.

“‘TAA’... What is that, like... Tactical Apocalypse assault?”

“You’re just making that up.”

“Timid Anomalous animals ?”

“Nope.”

“Totally Awesome asset ?”

“Please stop.”

He turned to me with that smile—the one that usually preceded our worst decisions. “Bro, what if this is, like... the door? Y’know, the door. The one they didn’t want people to open because what’s behind it is too good. Like... unlimited money or life eternal”

“More likely a slow and horrible death from exposure to weaponized Cold War nightmares. Did you miss the part where it literally tells you not to open it unless some emergency protocol is running? Which, by the way, isn’t.”

“Or maybe,” he said, tapping the bulkhead like he was trying to wake it up, “we are the emergency.”

I stared in confusion but also… intrigue .

“You don’t even know what that means, do you.”

“Nope,” he said proudly, “but it feels profound.”

“Okay, listen, I’m gonna lay this out real slow,” I said, stepping between him and the bulkhead like I was talking down a guy from licking an electric fence. “This door is a bad idea. The kind of bad idea that gets government agents sent to zip up body bags. And we’re not trained for this. We are park rangers, Ozzy. We collect garbage and tell drunk hikers to stop throwing trail mix at raccoons. We don’t explore locked, foreboding Cold War death doors.”

He tilted his head, thinking. “...What if the raccoons are behind the door?”

“What.”

“Think about it,” he said, in that deranged prophet tone he used whenever he was connecting dots that didn’t exist. “What if the raccoons evolved into that dog thing? Started using human tech or is even some fucked up experiment gone wrong? Maybe this is like... their command center. The whole ‘missing hikers’ thing? Boom. Irradiated demon escapes and kills everyone. This is where it escaped from.”

“You need to sleep. Immediately. Possibly for a week.”

He waved his hand. “You laugh now, but when you’re in the middle of boss fight with a feral ghoul you’re gonna wish I opened that door first.”

I didn’t dignify that with a response. I just dropped back onto the bench and buried my face in my hands.

Then came the silence. The kind that fills a space when you realize the night’s not over, but your brain definitely is. The rain continued to hammer the hatch above us. Somewhere in the darkness, something groaned—probably a pipe. Or a cryptid. Who knows anymore.

Ozzy slumped onto the cot again, defeated but not deterred. “Fine. I won’t open it yet. But you gotta admit... it’s kinda weird that we found this place, right?”

I sighed. “Everything about this is weird. But until something starts banging on that bulkhead and yelling in Morse code, we are not opening it. we wait here for the rain to cool off then we head home in the morning”

He raised an eyebrow. “But if it does start yelling in Morse code…or the rain doesn’t stop”

“Then we definitely don’t open it.and…. we will just have to be soggy for a few hours”

He looked disappointed. Like I’d told him Christmas was canceled .

We spent the rest of that hour talking about the bunker and laying out our gear to dry against old filing cabinets labelled “port astra manufacturing co ltd”which after researching it just doesnt exist..  We also looked through the desks but there was little substance other than old coke cans and even a vintage casio watch, which was a welcome upgrade to my area 51 novelty watch Oz brought back for me on his vacation last spring, that reminds me I gotta get a battery for it. occasionally we were  interrupted by the sound of thunder or dripping water, and the gentle creak of some ancient, unknowable part of the bunker settling. Or waking up...but Probably settling.

It was whilst we were routing through the drawers that ozzy found something. something so foreboding and cursed I would rather he told me he we are actually related or something. 

As he stared in silence at his discovery I walked to meet him and it was there we saw it, a ventillation duct 2 feet tall and 3 feet wide leading down into the bowels of the bunker, with fresh … wet… marks, It was obvious. 

Something that had been in the rain was inside the bunker. We both knew what it was and at this point i realised. We cant get back out that hatch. 

What we found…  I will have to put it in the next log. The rain is starting outside and…  i don’t like the sound.
