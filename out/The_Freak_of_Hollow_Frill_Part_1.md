My name is Macie. I was never the most popular person in town. Most of the people I grew up with saw me as that weird girl. They always amused me.  If one were to ask why they didn't like me I would respond by saying it supposed it had to do with the fact that I'm a witch.

Ah yes. The Witch of Hollow Frill. Not only was I a witch, but I was also a troublemaker. I don't see how causing a little fun havoc was too much trouble. It's not like people got hurt. Too badly. Oh well.

It didn't matter. I'm only telling you this little bit about myself because this is what I was thinking when I looked at the killer I held captive in my basement. I saw him about to kill a woman and stopped him with my dear pet Huxlee. Such a good spider he is. Anyway, Killian was looking back at me, an angry growl coming from him as he yelled all kinds of things. He demanded I let him out, told me all the things he would do to me once he was out, threatening to pull my insides out. I was particularly interested in that last part myself. Who knew what kind of goodies could possibly be inside a human. I thought of maybe seeing for myself with him. But something made me want to do something else with him. 

I remember how the woman we saved reacted to Huxlee. She just looked at him like he was a monster, taking the wallet Killian took from her before hurrying out of there. I told Huxlee she was grateful but she acted as if he was going to hurt her. All because he was a spider. But he would never do that. Not to someone innocent.

I've never liked seeing people be so disgusted by spiders. The way that just carelessly smacked them on the ground, stomped on them, hit them with something. All those things themselves bothered me but when that lady reacted the way she did to Huxlee, I knew something had to be done. It was time for this town to stop being so scared of spiders and treating them badly.

I told my friends Grady and Maggie about it and asked them what they thought I should do. Grady wasn't sure but Maggie had the perfect idea. She suggested using my spiders to help out the people in town. They would have to start loving spiders then. Something then came to my head that made the idea even better. I would change Killian into a spider and make him help people. It was perfect. Seeing how great he can be as a spider will definitely get Killian to change his ways. And once people see how fun and great being a spider can be, so much that it reformed a killer, it'll give them all the more reason to give spiders a chance.

When I went back to my home to do my work, Maggie went along with me. She wanted to be the first one to see this spider of mine. I told her it was great that she was coming along. Like Grady, Maggie understood me. She wasn't freaked out by me or scared of me. This probably had to do with the fact that she was an elf. She knew what it was like being different from the others in Hollow Frill and we got along really well. When we got to my house and greeted my undead pig, Danny, we entered my lab.

There Killian was sleeping. He must've gotten tired of all the yelling. I laughed and told handed Maggie the keys to the cell, telling her to open them for me. 

Once she did, I entered and placed my hand on the murderer's head. My eyes glow as I changed into a beautiful abomination. 

His eyes opened and he got up and made a noise, almost as if he was trying to yell again. He then realized something was different about him. I made a mirror appear and showed it to them. I explained why I changed him into a spider and why this was good for him. To my surprise, he didn't throw too much of a fit. It seemed like he understood. I asked if he would be willing to help me and he just nodded his head. I grinned. It would soon be time to carry out the plan into action. I told Maggie to watch over him as I went to feed Danny.

As I was pouring food for my beloved pig into the kitchen, I heard the front door. It was as if something busted through it. I went to check out what it was and saw Maggie was there. I asked what happened.

Maggie told me that Killian got out. All I do is smile at this. He was so eager to help that he decided to start without me. I told Maggie to go after him and see what he does as I wanted to let Grady know the good news.

He didn't pick up during my attempts to call him. I looked at the clock and realized now was the time when we would be busy with farm work. I decided I would call him later and decided to get some food for myself.

I never had to make that call though. After a while, my phone rang and I picked it up. It was Grady.

"Macie, you gotta help! There's some big spider thing and-"

I interrupt him with a chuckle. I tell him that was just Killian, who I transformed for my plan.

"Macie, you don't understand," Grady responded in fear and terror. "I just saw him. I just devoured two people that were just walking on the street."

"What?!" I asked him, shocked to hear this.

"That's not all," Grady said. "He also-" I heard a gunshot coming from his end of the phone.

"Where are you?!" Macie asked.

"I-I'm downtown!" Grady said. 

I hang up the phone and ran out of the house. What was Killian doing? Where was Maggie?

When I got into town, I started to look around. Danny was behind me. I kept looking until I heard a scream, then ran in that direction. I couldn't believe it, but what I saw when I got there went chills down my spine.

The body parts of what looked to be police offers were everywhere. People were running away from the scene, including Grady. What got me the most was when I saw Killian.

He has gotten bigger. But how? His mouth was red and the head of a police officer was hanging from it.

My eyes went wide as he spotted me and started coming closer.
