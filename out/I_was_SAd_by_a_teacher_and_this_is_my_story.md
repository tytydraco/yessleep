*TRIGGER WARNING

I was SA’d by a teacher who has taught for 37 years, across 3 states (Location: Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas) in 7 different schools. He has sexually abused/harassed numerous of girls throughout his years of teaching. His own son has come forward stating what his dad has done, not to mention over 6 police reports made against him and still nothing. The only thing that has come from it was that he was placed on the child maltreatment registry for the girls who he affected in the mid 80s. Also there is a civil lawsuit made against him by those same girls who are now women.

My abuse by this teacher occurred in the early 2000s when I was between the ages 5-10. He was never my teacher but was a bus aide on my bus and also lived In My neighborhood in Lake Dallas Texas. When I was 10 I was realizing that what he was doing was wrong, and finally had the courage to do something. So One day on the bus, he ask to walk me across the street and when he did he told me  that he was going to come right back. I remember locking all the doors and within 30 min later he comes knocking on my door and looking through my windows.  I called my mom and told her what was going on. And she had my best friend’s brother come pick me up since she wasn’t near by. My mom contacted the school and had a meeting with the superintendent and told him about the bus incident. From what I remember I didn’t tell my mom the whole story just the bus incident.. my mom however heard stories about him kissing other students and when she brought this up to him, the superintendent responded that he saw no issue with this teacher kissing students because he did the same thing…

After this incident I remember being assaulted again and at his house. I dont remember how I got there but have memories of it. From what I can recall I felt like he drugged me from how I remember feeling. On that same day his wife came home. I remember her helping me in the bathroom and apologizing to me and kept saying that her husband is sick.  The next thing I remember is being placed in his truck and him threatening me that he would kill my family if I told anyone. Then the next thing I remember is waking up on my front lawn.

My memories of the abused completely vanished until recently after going to therapy. When my memories came back I’ve felt like I have done everything I could possibly do to get him charged. I Made my police report, called the school police of where he was currently teaching, as well as school officials, and nothing was being done. After a month goes by after making my report,  he is still teaching and nothing is being done. I had to go to social media to make a post about what happened.. from then on it got a lot of attention and the students at the school held a protest since there where over 30 girls who have come forward. The school finally did an investigation and put him on paid administrative leave with his complicit wife who also taught there. Then the school decided to retire him and his wife and here we are today 3 years later and police refuse to charge him.

Before I even made my police report, his own son went to the department of education with a letter of victims stories. One girl didn’t want her story in writing and rather be called. However no one ever called her..

I have gone to FBI, police, news outlets and nothing…i feel like this goes a lot deeper than what is seen on the surface. What I do know is that he has ties with the church of Christ and has been a youth minister at these churches. Not to mention that everyone on his job applications are also members of church of Christ. 

 Anyways I feel like I have done all that I could do but still fall short…
