After not sleeping on the day before YESTERDAY, I do not sleep. Last night, I slept for 8 hours, and still not enough to remove my grogginess TODAY. I was told by my parents to wait for my brother then they left. After eating. I started to get sleepy at 9:15-9:20 AM while watching an anime series. I closed my laptop and started to sleep. I was in the living room on the sofa BTW.

**NIGHTMARES:**

FIRST NIGHTMARE: Lulu & June is the name of the dog (dachshunds) they somehow unlocked the door. I was irritated by it because I thought I locked it from the inside, felt weird, and they kept their heads looking at the door. Normally, they will try to go in, and pee inside. So, I get up and locked the door. And then all of a sudden someone tried to open the door from outside. THE KEY WAS SPINNING. I TRIED TO HOLD ON TO THE DOOR!! BUT HE OVERPOWERED ME AND THEN I WAKE UP, SHIVERING WITH GOOSEBUMPS at 9:35 AM. Started to sleep again because I was so tired.

SECOND NIGHTMARE: So, for some reason in my second dream, my mother arrives home with somebody then, they are having a conversation in the living room where I slept, but I don’t know what they are talking about. I can’t hear it. It felt weird. I lean into my mother AND I get a pillow and try it to put on my mother’s shoulders and after trying to put it I can’t move my arm! THEN THE FUCKED-UP THING IS I HEAR MY MOTHER TALKING OUTSIDE WITH MY BROTHER! AFTER HEARING THAT, I CAN NOT MOVE. I'M WITH A FAKE ONE CAUSE I REALIZE HER FACE WAS BLANK! I AM SHIVERING IN MY DREAM CAUSE OF THE FAKE MOTHER AND THE OTHER ONE-STOP TALKING. I feel up sucked up by this fake mother. I felt a tremendously heavy sensation towards her. SUDDENLY…

I WOKE UP AGAIN AT 9:45 AM SHIVERING AGAIN. IT FELT LIKE REALITY. I INSTANTLY HEAR ringing bells outside, and I assumed it is my brother on his bike. I legit get up and unlocked the door and I am right it was my brother! After unlocking the gate outside, I told him about my nightmare. And then he stops and told me if I am sure that this REALITY is not a DREAM. He looked at me I can’t see his face it is BLANK AGAIN. BUT I CAN TELL HE IS SMILING MENACINGLY. AND I WAKE UP…

the moment my eyes opened at 9:50 AM I INSTANTLY HEAR THE RINGING BELLS OUTSIDE! IT IS THE SAME FEELING IT FEELS LIKE DEJA VU! I LEGIT PANICKED AND FELT GOOSEBUMPS. I IMMEDIATELY OPEN MY DOORS TO SEE WHO IS RINGING THE BELLS BUT I CAN’T FIND IT OUTSIDE. And suddenly remembered that my brother didn’t BRING HIS bike and his bike has no bells at all. SO, I ASSUMED IT IS A NIGHTMARE WITHIN A NIGHTMARE!

**THE FIRST AND SECOND NIGHTMARE WAS VIVIDLY DARK SO I ASSUME IT IS NIGHT (THIS IS A HINT THAT THIS IS A DREAM I’M SO STUPID,** **IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LUCID DREAM!!)**

**THIRD IS THE NIGHTMARE WITHIN THE NIGHTMARE IT FELT SO REAL CAUSE IT WAS DAYTIME.**

SO, I STARTED OPENING MY DOORS BECAUSE IT WAS DARK INSIDE IN LIVING ROOM EVEN THOUGH IT IS DAY TIME. I GET MY LAPTOP AND STARTED TO WRITE MY DREAM BEFORE I FORGET IT.
