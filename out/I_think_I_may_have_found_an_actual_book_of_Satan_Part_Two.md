I got the lock off the notebook last night, I tried picking it but it eventually clicked open when I tried 999 which is a spiritual number but not satanic. Anyway, I’ve been reading the notebook and it’s a mess of disturbing drawings, at least 6 different languages, Latin, French, English, Swedish, Chinese and Hebrew. The book is sporadic and on the first page is a rant entirely in Latin about how Satan needs to win the second war, their’s a page on how to make a Molotov cocktail, and a in depth drawing of orgies. A lot of it makes no sense and is just incoherent, but Some of the words that keep coming up are noting that the more coherent pages are “excerpts from the Zorinn”, “Failed Genocide.” And “Heaven is a Lie.”

Some of the verses/sections that stuck with me are below, 

From French

Heaven is a Lie, heaven is slavery to a god who controls those, there is no fun, no pleasure, only worshipping a cruel being. The angels try to kill themselves daily, but he won’t let them.

From Latin

The Antichrist must find the Zorinn.

From Chinese 

Satan rewards followers with pleasures or power in hell.

From English

 immoral man of free will is better than a moral slave

The one that really stuck with me the most is a doomsday clock written in Latin  that had ten points on it, in order.

Satan loses the first war.

Jesus is born

Satan gains strength

Lies began to surface 

False prophets arise 

Failed Genocide by god

Antichrist is born

Zorinn is spread 

Great Beast arrives 

Antichrist takes gods throne

The one hand on the drawn clock was pointing towards right before Zorinn is spread, which is frightening. Does anyone know what Zorinn, Great Beast, or any theories or anything? Because weird things are happening, my lights have been flickering and there was a dead deer outside my apartment.

I did some research on the word Zorinn and outside of the computer program and some random people with the name, it doesnt seem to have any real satanic connections but yet most of the more coherent stuff including the doomsday clock and all the passages that really stood out were from the Zorinn.

Zorin was apparently a name of a communist filmmaker but I can’t find anything on Zorinn that could be related to this stuff. I’d like to make a note of something I didn’t remember about Kaiya which is that she had the biggest, creepiest smile when I told her my Chinese Zodiac sign was a goat. Theirs also several passages in the book that seem to have incantions or ritual guides. This book is handwritten and trying not to agree with the satanic book but it makes some good points that explains some things.

Sorry for spelling errors or grammar issues, I’m a little shook up.

I’ll update if anything else happens and please if someone has some information or insight, comment pls.
