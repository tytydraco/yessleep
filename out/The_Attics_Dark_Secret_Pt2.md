I couldn't shake off the terror that had gripped me since that fateful night in the attic. The supernatural man's warning that he was still after me had sent shivers down my spine, and I couldn't ignore the feeling of being watched wherever I went. Desperate to find answers, I decided to confront my fears and return to the attic, hoping to put an end to the nightmare once and for all.

With trembling hands, I pushed open the attic door and cautiously stepped inside. The air felt heavy, and the shadows seemed to dance around me. I called out to the supernatural man, demanding to know what he wanted from me. But there was no response, just an eerie silence that sent chills down my spine.

Suddenly, the attic seemed to come alive. Objects flew across the room, and the walls seemed to close in on me. Panicking, I rushed towards the window, hoping to escape. But as I reached for the latch, I felt a sharp pain on my back, as if something had clawed at me.

I screamed and stumbled back, but the window slammed shut, trapping me inside. The supernatural man's laughter echoed through the attic, taunting me. I knew I had to find another way out, and fast.

I searched desperately for a trapdoor or a hidden passage, but the attic seemed to twist and turn, disorienting me. The supernatural man's presence was palpable, and I could feel his malevolent energy all around me. I realized that I was no match for his supernatural powers, and my only chance of survival was to escape the attic.

With no other options left, I made a daring decision. I rushed towards the window and threw it open, ignoring the pain in my back. I climbed onto the window sill and looked down, realizing that it was a two-story drop to the ground. But I had no choice. I had to take the leap.

I closed my eyes, said a silent prayer, and jumped out of the window. The impact was jarring, and I felt a sharp pain in my ankle as I hit the ground. I crawled away from the house, adrenaline pumping through my veins, and managed to flag down a passing car for help.

The police arrived soon after, and I told them my harrowing tale. But they found no evidence of the supernatural man in the attic, and their skeptical looks made me question my own sanity. They concluded that I had suffered a mental breakdown and had imagined the entire ordeal.

I was admitted to the hospital for my injuries, but the nightmare was far from over. I couldn't shake off the feeling that the supernatural man had escaped the attic and was now after me, seeking revenge for my escape attempt. The hospital became my new prison, and I constantly looked over my shoulder, expecting him to appear at any moment.

As I write this from my hospital bed, I can hear strange noises in the corridors at night, and I catch glimpses of shadows that shouldn't be there. The supernatural man's laughter echoes in my dreams, and I am plagued by the fear that he is still lurking in the shadows, biding his time to strike again.

I know the truth, even if the police and the doctors don't believe me. The supernatural man is real, and he won't rest until he gets his revenge. I am trapped in a living nightmare, and I fear that my only chance of survival is to unravel the secrets of the forest and find a way to defeat him once and for all. But time is running out, and I don't know how much longer I can hold on before the supernatural man comes for me again.
