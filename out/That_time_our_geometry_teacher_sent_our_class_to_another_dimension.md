It was an easy test. Outrageously easy. Like, Teacher Chico really wanted us to succeed. Unfortunately for him, we didn’t feel like passing on the test, each for our own very personal reasons, and it was probably very frustrating that he ended up with seven students in the Recuperation. Recuperation, for those who don’t live in Brazil, is similar to summer school, but it only takes two weeks. At the end of those two weeks, you have a test, and then there’s always two alternatives: if you studied or the teacher or director are kind enough, you can pass to the next year. If you fail, you have to do the whole school year again, and you lose an entire deal of your life. 

Of course, there’s always the secret ending option that my Geometry teacher came up with himself, which consists of sacrificing your wife with your Pythagoric cult friends and sending your students to another dimension. This latter option would probably not be very good for the students, but at least you don’t have to study geometry. 

Let me introduce the Geometry recuperation class of 2018, from the Nilo Peçanha Federal School, in Horizontes Antagônicos. This is where all of this takes place.

There was me, who failed the test, probably because of reasons related to not studying at all for the entire year, and spending my entire free time playing Cities Skyline, Civilization V, Hitman 2 and Skyrim. You can guess I didn’t go to many parties and wasn’t very popular. Now let’s talk about my friends.

There was Popcorn, real name Lúcio, my best friend, who managed to be even more of a nerd than I was, as difficult as this was, always carrying popcorn around and watching movies. Instead of a gamer, Lúcio was an avid cinephile. Unironically, his mother owned one of the two only movie theaters in town, which explains his seemingly endless access to popcorn. I don’t know why exactly he failed, since his grades had always been well above average, but I did notice he looked like he wasn’t getting much sleep, so I assumed he was spending every night watching movies.

There was Bia, who actually passed the test. The absolute madlass liked going to school so much she decided to stick around the Recuperation classes. She was studying a lot because she wanted to become a doctor, even if her true passion was art.

Now that we’re done with my extensive list of friends, let’s talk about the other people stuck in Recuperation. 

There was Juliana, the top mean girl of the school. She had the looks of a pop star and the personality of a trash can. She didn’t even attend the test, probably because she had a hangover from the previous weekend or forgot to come to class altogether. Oh, and she was dating Oregano. 

Speaking of Oregano, nickname for Rogério, was a very unpleasant person, who also had the body of a Football (or soccer for Americans) player, and the personality of a radioactive trash can on fire. As he was the son of the city’s police chief, no one messed with him. Even when he was being obnoxiously violent to everyone who wasn’t a jock, extremely sexist to all girls, and a trash human being. And even when he was caught smoking weed in the school’s bathroom, the police was called, and they said he was actually smoking Oregano. Hence his nickname. Okay, I admit I don’t like him, but in my defense, he didn’t like me as well. Like his girlfriend, he also didn’t attend the test and failed, and probably for the same reason.

There was Thiago, Oregano’s sidekick, who followed him around like a dog and imitated him in everything he could. I heard he only failed the test because he saw his “role model” had skipped class and failed. 

And finally, there was Ricardo. He was a creepy guy, rarely attending class, and when he did, he sat on the end of the class, staring at everyone and rarely saying anything. He also wasn’t popular, but not because he was a Nerd or introvert, but because he was fucking creepy. Even teachers avoided talking to him too much.  He also missed the test, I don’t have any idea why and I don’t want to know, thanks. Oh, and one last thing, usually we think of the “quiet creepy kid in the back of the class” as a slim person. That wasn’t the case with Ricardo Pardal. He was the strongest of us all, he went to gym every night. Seriously, his biceps were larger than my head. If he wasn’t so uncanny, he’d probably be very attractive. 

With our team of people who failed the geometry test complete (and a person that didn’t but stuck around the school anyways), I think we can introduce the one who least wanted to be there: Teacher Francisco (nickname Chico) Andrade. We didn’t know much about him, as he was a member of the rare breed of teachers who don’t spend their entire classes talking about their lives. Chico was always succinct in his explanations, which always took around fifteen minutes, after which he proceeded to give us tons of exercises and sit by his table while observing us trying to solve them. There was one thing that we could say about him: He had a passion for mathematics that I never saw in anyone else. He treated it like it was his religion, and when people committed gross mistakes, he always got visibly anxious and explained the subject again and again to the person until they said they understood. His tests were notoriously difficult and merciless. Some said he once reprobated a third of the class. And that’s why it was so uncharacteristic of him to give us an easy test.

But the teacher that went to teach us in recuperation wasn’t the same one I described just above. No, he wasn’t a substitute or impersonator (who would even want to impersonate a Geometry teacher?). What I mean is that Chico had changed. He was behaving differently, less patient in his explanations, and he seemed almost… Angry? 

Well, the change in his behavior got really obvious in the third day of recuperation. He simply walked into the class, gave us a folder of exercises and another with answers and basic explanations, and then just left. He didn’t even say bye. 

“What’s up with him? He didn’t even ask if we had questions.” Bia said to me and Popcorn.

“Maybe something happened to him. We don’t know.” Popcorn said while he discreetly ate some popcorn. 

After thirty minutes, Juliana, Thiago and Oregano, who were loudly chatting on the back of the room, simply got up and left. (But not before saying goodbye, and by saying goodbye, I mean Oregano robbed Popcorn’s popcorn sack and “accidentally” bumped into my table, throwing all my stuff around the floor. No, he didn’t offer to pick things up, he just laughed). 

We waited a bit longer, but when we had finished our exercise papers, we decided to leave too. My friends left the room before me, and when I did I turned off the lights.

“Dude, isn’t Pardal in there?” Mentioned Popcorn as soon as I was out of the classroom.

“Oh…” I paced back to the classroom, and turned the lights back on. I thought maybe Ricardo had fallen asleep, since he didn’t complain when I turned off the lights, but he was very well awake. And staring at me with that blank face of his. “Sorry. I forgot you were there.” I said. He just kept staring. “You’re not angry, are you?” And he somehow managed to stare even more blankly. “You… You do know he isn’t coming back today, right? It’s been nearly an hour. You can go home.” He stared. “Uh… Bye, I guess.” I said.  

“Are you okay, man?” Popcorn asked when I got back to the corridor. 

“Don’t worry about me. Where’s Bia?”

“She went to the principal’s office to complain about Chico. Said he wasn’t doing his job and she had questions about polyhedrons or something.”

“Classic Bia.” I laughed. 

Ironically, she wasted her time going to the principal’s office, as the principal was near the exit of the school.

“Hey, why are you two leaving so early?” Asked director Sandra Mourinho. Theoretically, there were still two hours left of amazing geometry class, but a class can’t teach itself.

“I think you should ask Teacher Chico. He just handed us some exercises and left.” I said.

“I see…” She seemed to notice Popcorn. “Lúcio, you’re in Recuperation? Never thought I’d see you here. What happened?”

“Wasn’t feeling very well the day of the test. Sorry.” 

“Don’t worry, I’ll make sure you pass. And you too, Vicente. Just put a little more effort in the recuperation test, okay? I’m sure you’ll do great.”

“Is Chico okay? This behavior is unusual from him.” Popcorn asked, genuinely worried.  

“Well… I’ll be sincere. He was very frustrated with your class. None of his other classes got Recuperation, and he was planning on traveling with his wife for their anniversary or something. He said the test he gave your class was really easy and all of that.”

“Sorry. I didn’t mean to fail.” I apologized. I was indeed at fault for not studying.

“But this is also on him, kids. I warned him several times, and all teachers for that matter, that it wasn’t wise to make travel plans. We don’t know if they’ll be stuck here for Recuperation or not.” 

“Also, I should say that Bia went to your office looking for you.” I told her.

“I know. My grandson installed an app for cameras here in my phone” She excitedly showed us. “I can see the entire school from here. Except for some classrooms, including yours. But don’t worry, the technicians will have it done soon, even before Recuperation ends.”

“Then you’re avoiding her?” I asked.

“No, just waiting a bit for her to calm down. She seems very upset right now, she’s even stomping around. As soon as she sits down I’m going there.”

The next day, Chico gave us folders of exercises, but this time, he just paced around for some minutes and then sat down, put on EarPods and began watching some movie in his phone. When Bia inevitably asked him about something, he answered the question as fast as he could and then went back to his own shenanigans. 

I was doing my exercises, and so was Popcorn. We preferred, however, not to talk to our teacher, instead we studied with the Geometry textbook or talking to Professor Google. Chico seemed to be still irritated, and him being the one who would correct our tests, we didn’t want to annoy him. Thiago, Oregano and Juliana were not doing their exercises, but they were talking as loudly as they could, and I preferred to think they were talking about the subject. And Ricardo didn’t show up that day. Not that it changed anything when he did, as he just did his math and then stared at nothing expressionless. Most of the Recuperation was like this for everyone. 

On the end of the day, when Chico was leaving, I approached him, and asked how hard the test would be. He just smiled and said that we wouldn’t even feel like we were doing a test.

///

On the day before the final exam, everyone was tense. Even Bia, who didn’t even need to do the final exam, seemed nervous. Like we subconsciously knew something was going to happen. The terrible trio (the nickname I gave Oregano and his pals) seemed for the first time to be actually studying. Even Pardal was there, focusing on his math and doing exercises. I was confident I knew everything he could put on the test, even if I had a talent for making mistakes in the easiest calculations, but something didn’t feel right too. And Popcorn also seemed tense. He was sweating profusely, even with the air conditioner turned on. 

Teacher Chico, for the first time in those two weeks, seemed genuinely excited. He was explaining Bia’s questions with his old passion again, and going around the classroom, supervising our exercises, and asking if we had any questions. I thought that maybe the principal had given him a pep talk, or maybe making our test had reawaken his forgotten passion for Math. Or maybe he had created a test so difficult that it would traumatize us all for eternity and he couldn’t wait to see us fail. Or maybe, he was happy that he’d be finally starting his vacation.

When the class ended, we were packing our things to leave. Juliana suddenly approached Bia. “Hey Bia, can I take a look at your notebook?” She asked, but in a way that was more a demand than a question. Even before Bia could answer, Juliana took her notebook from her and went on to read it.

“Hey, I didn't give you permission!” Complained Bia, but Juliana just ignored her. “There's personal stuff in there!” 

“Like I cared about your boring life. You don’t even have to do the test, girl. Chill, ‘Kay.” Juliana said, as she stored the notebook inside her bag. 

“Give it back to her.” Popcorn said threateningly, stepping in front of Juliana and facing her with an ugly expression. Juliana deviously smiled. 

“Who the fuck do you think you’re dealing with?!” Oregano came and pushed Popcorn back. He fell to the floor. “Is he bothering you, Ju?”

“Don’t waste your time with this loser, babe. Let’s go.” Said Juliana, and they both left the room, followed by Thiago, who turned the lights off before exiting too, leaving us in the dark.

“Are you okay, man?” I asked Popcorn, as I helped him get up. 

“I will complain to the director that he assaulted you and she stole my notebook. There’s a camera up there now, she ought to have seen it!” Bia said.

“Like it would do anything. He’s done worse things and got away with it because of his daddy.” Popcorn took a deep breath. “Don’t waste your time.”

“Still, I need my notebook back. All my notes on Geometry for the National Exam are there.” She was clearly trying as hard as she could not to cry out of frustration. 

“Calm down, Bia. Juliana is a bitch, but not the devil. She’ll give your notebook back after the test” I tried to reassure her. It was partially wishful thinking. Knowing Juliana, she could very well give the notebook back completely torn apart or destroy it just to be a bitch. 

We collected our things and went towards the door. I made sure to look if Pardal was still there this time. He was silent as always at the end of the room, staring at me. But this time, he had a wide smile. I turned the lights back on and left.

///

After a sleepless night of intensive study, I arrived at the school. Popcorn and Bia were already inside the classroom, checking their notes. Pardal was at the end of the room, carefully reading the geometry textbook. Immediately after sitting down, I began reading for the millionth time my notes. I felt a dreadful feeling, I knew somehow something was going to happen, but I thought it was only going to be a borderline impossible test and that there was a very high possibility of having to repeat the school year and my parents being mad at me. 

Not long after, Juliana, Oregano and Thiago arrived. Oregano seemed tranquil, clearly knowing the school would approve him even if he left all questions blank and drew a giant penis on the folder. Thiago and Juliana seemed more nervous. She didn’t even put on make-up that day, and was reading Bia’s notebook while walking. 

There was no popcorn, loud talking or intensive staring today. Everyone was focused. If you have ever done a difficult and important test, you know the anxiety aura that fluctuates around the room when it’s about to start. The tension was almost visible. And the height of this tension was reached when we heard the door handle turning. 

“Good morning, kids!” Chico said as he walked inside the room. He had strange smile that extended from ear to ear. “Please, turn off your cellphones and devices, and put them here on my table, after you finish I’ll give them back to you. You know the rules. No cheating, no talking, if I see you looking at something other than your test, I’ll give you zero. You’re almost adults, so behave.” 

We all put our phones and devices on the teacher’s table, and he opened a drawer, put them all inside, and locked it with a little key that he put on the desk. 
“Ricardo Pardal, your phone please.” The teacher demanded. 

“I don’t have one.” He answered. Somehow, his voice was as devoid of emotion as his face.

“Okay then. But I’ll be watching you.” He said, as he went around the classroom distributing the exams. 

I glared at the test as it reached my hands. I could already see the first questions were easier and it got progressively more difficult, but not the impossible challenge I thought it was. After some thirty minutes, I finished all the questions on the front of the paper, and went to the back of it. The questions were harder, but not impossible. I had studied the subject, and felt confident, as I began doing the first question on the back.

“Teacher… There’s something wrong in the last question.” Bia said. 

“ Focus on your test, Bia. If there is a mistake, I’ll nullify the question later.” He said, still smiling. Almost shaking with what appeared to be excitement.

I got curious, so I went straight to the last question. There was a pentagon there, that somehow had… seven sides.

A pentagon that had seven sides. 

Yes, I know pentagons have five sides, but that one had seven, and no, it wasn’t an heptagon, because it’s sum of interior angles wasn’t 900°, it was 540°. Even if it had seven sides. 

The image seemed to spin, like it was animated. The geometrical figure size grew, covering more of the folder, and bright dark lights came out it’s distorted sides.

My head was aching. What the hell was this? I had studied this subject. I’m not a genius in math, I’m terrible at it. But this time, I knew it wasn’t me who was wrong. It was somehow, Math itself. 

That pentagon was not possible.

Something dropped on the paper. Dark blood, coming out of my nose.

“Teacher, I think I’m-” When I looked at him, my head started aching even more. His head was all distorted, made of spinning straight angles, before it adjusted back to it’s normal features. 

For a moment, I thought I was having a mental breakdown, but only a second after, I heard Juliana screaming.

“Teacher! The angles are moving!” 

“Calm down, all of you.” Chico chuckled. “Took you all long enough to get to the real test.” He said, as he got up. He went to the white board, and opened his bag. He produced a crimson glass jar, dipped his fingers inside it, and then started drawing the same bizarre pentagon in the board using some kind of red paint.

“Teacher… Is that… Is that blood?” Popcorn asked. I could feel the fear in his voice, because I was feeling the same thing. 

“Yes, Lúcio.” He answered as he kept drawing. “My wife’s blood, to be more precise.”

“What?!” Bia screamed.

“Oh, don’t worry. She deserved it… And all of you deserve it as well.” 

“What are you talking about?” Thiago asked.

“That can’t be true!” Juliana shouted.

“Someone go fetch the director!” I said. Bia got up and ran towards the door, but as soon as she passed nearby the pentagon the teacher was drawing, she collapsed to the floor with a blood-curling scream, impossibly loud, and distorted somehow. 

“I suggest you all stay very still. The hepta-pentagon is very metaphysically unstable. Looking at it from the wrong angle could compromise your cognitive abilities.” Chico said as he finally finished the design. The seven-sided pentagon on the board seemed alive somehow, pulsating. We heard footsteps on the corridor.

“What’s going on?” Director Sandra said as she rapidly entered the room. She looked at the girl who was groaning in pain on the floor and the teacher, whose hand was covered in dark red blood. “What the hell is this, Francisco?! What have you done?!” 

“They didn’t want to learn Geometry the easy way, Sandra. Now I’m gonna teach it to them the hard way. If I were you, I’d stay out of this. I don’t want to harm you.” He warned.

“Are you out of your mind?! I’m calling the cops, right now!” Sandra said as she picked up her phone.

“No cellphones during test.” He said. Suddenly, a bang, and then the principal was on the floor, a puddle of blood forming underneath her. Not a second later, three people wearing white and yellow robes and what appeared to be Ancient Greek-like theatrical masks entered the classroom. One of them was holding a pistol, smoke still coming out of it.

“It was supposed to be an easy test.” Chico looked at us, anger brewing in his voice, mixed with some desperation, resentment and grief. “I had to cancel my travel plans because you couldn’t pay attention on my subject! It’s your fault my wife travelled with that scoundrel instead of me! It’s your damn fault that she’s dead now! It was supposed to be an easy test, goddamnit!” Chico screamed, the anger and frustration in his voice reverberating throughout the room. 

“I’m… I’m sorry…” I muttered. One of the cultists approached the teacher.

“Kyrios, the internal angle sum is already above 970°. We have to open the portal now or the entire room will collapse.” A robed woman said as she looked at a scientific calculator. 

“Yes. It’s time.” He said. The cultists started speaking with distorted, high-pitched voices. They were saying numbers at a seemingly random but at the same time extremely well-organized sequence. My eardrums started hurting and I felt my muscles getting weaker. The others were also groaning in pain or screaming. 

“Stop it! Please!” Oregano begged. I had never seen him expressing fear. I looked back at the other students. Everyone was terrified, in deep pain or passing out. Except for Ricardo, he just seemed confused.

And then I looked back towards our insane teacher. He was drawing functions and variables and complex equations in the board and wall using his wife’s blood, while the cultists kept singing the mathematical sequence. The impossible pentagon started expanding, roaring in a high-pitched distorting tone, and a dark, muddy water started coming out of it. It engulfed the entire room in a horribly fast pace. The last thing I saw before everything got underwater was Chico’s eyes, full of wonder and amazement. I think he was finally able to show who he really was to us. And at that moment, even if our situations and intentions were completely different, I sympathized with him. I knew what was to hide in plain sight.

“Hey! Vicente! Wake up!” 

I woke up coughing water.

“Are you okay?” I heard Popcorn asking. I spat out more water, my eyes dizzy. I could smell the sea and feel a breeze on my skin. What was very strange, because our city was located very far away from any beach. 

It was night. I could see starts blinking in the sky, but none that I recognized, and no moon either. 

And the stars, they were not bright… They were black. Black starts. Yet they still emitted light. How was this possible? 

I coughed more and asked: “Where are we, Lúcio? What happened?” 

“I don’t know. We seem to be in some kind of island. I just woke up too.” 

“Where is Bia?” I asked as I picked myself up. “How did we get here?”

“I just said I don’t know, Vicente! I have no idea! …Sorry, I didn’t mean to scream at you. I’m… I’m just scared.” 

“Don’t worry about me.” I looked around, still weakened. Ahead of us, there was a vast dark sea. And behind us, there was a seemingly untouched by man forest, of large, tree-sized glowing fungus.

“Did our teacher sent us to fucking Morrowind?” I asked.

“What’s Morrowind?” Popcorn asked.

“Uh… It’s nothing. Come on, we need to look for Bia. And figure out a way to go back from… Wherever we are.” I said. If only I knew that I would not be going home anytime soon.
