It's been awhile and this is the first chance I've had to make an update. If you haven't seen the previous part, [here it is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15xi213/i_was_attacked_by_something_a_few_weeks_ago_part_4/) If you'd like to go to the beginning [it's here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15rcc8e/i_was_attacked_by_something_a_few_weeks_ago/)

So much has happened since my last part. I was tortured, healed, brought to the brink of death, healed again, then given information. I'd say the information I gained was well worth the pain I've been put through and the losses that were made to obtain it. This is going to be a long one, so I guess I'll start with the day after Don was put into a coma.

As I mentioned, Don was in a coma after he saved me from the voices. By the way, that thing has a name. I heard some of the security talking about it calling it the "Crocotta" or Lil' Croc for short. I actually know what that references in Greek mythology, though it is a little off. The crocotta can imitate voices and calls to people to eat them. Whatever this is more like.. assimilates them.

Anyways, Lilly and Bake showed up at my room the day after that incident and told me I need to be really careful now. What I did is going to cause the higher ups to investigate me even more than before. Boy were they right on that.

They left after delivering the warning and my door slammed shut soon after. A gas started filling my room and I could hear banging and shouts coming from the other side of the door. I couldn't move or speak and I started feeling really lethargic. It seemed like forever passed by where all I could do was watch this gas seep in more and more from tiny holes at the bottom of the walls. The last thing I saw was my door slowly open as men in lab coats marched in, a singular person stood against the other wall, their faces a blur of emotions before it settled on an evil smile.

I came to strapped to a wall, I say strapped but it was more like I was crucified. There were thick paddings around my wrists and ankles with sharp barbs that dug into my skin. It took it all out of me not to cry out whenever I moved my head to look around. Across from me were eight doors, each with a different emblem above them. 

One was a woman with horns and a whip. 

One a skeletal whale with many birds and fish following it. 

Something that looked like a zombie was next to that. 

Then a beautiful bird with many vibrant orange colorations. 

A griffin standing proud on top of a mountain

A three headed dog with a menacing face on one head, a happy face on the next, then a sad one on the last.

The next door had a typical sasquatch emblem on it, like the "Big Foot Crossing" signs in Washington.

The final door had an infinity emblem.

Once I finished looking at the doors I noticed a table in front of me. Surgical tools were lined up along a side table next to it. This both terrified me and raised a strange excitement inside of me. What happened next killed all excitement.

In, from the door with the infinity emblem, came the monster that had bit me what seemed like so long ago. Only it was also strapped down. Long scars were all over its body and it looked heavily sedated. In one fluid motion the two big men in lab coats that brought it in threw its body onto the table and proceeded to strap it down. All it did was look at me. I winced as I felt my wrist burn where the straps put on it were put to tight. That or it was just because I was moving without realizing it.

Another door opened, this one seemingly out of no where, and in stepped a short male figured person with a mask on. I'd call it a tengu mask but the only similarity was the long nose. All I could see were the swirling orange and grey eyes through the eye holes as they examined me, then the monster. 

"Look, look!" An excited voice said from behind the mask. "I'm the first one to play with this one!"

I grimaced at the implication and said, "Judging by your short stature it's probably the only fun you'll have in awhile. Best to make the best of it." Don't get me wrong. Short kings deserve love, too. Not when they're obviously about to mess with me though.

He smiled at me, then grabbed a bone saw from the side table and slammed it into the creature in front of him. There was a burning and popping sound as it easily sliced through the flesh of the creatures arm. The monster made no noise, but I screamed out as the most unbearable pain I had ever felt shot through my arm.

In a matter of seconds the entire arm was chopped off and fell limply next to the table, still held by the strap. My wrists were bleeding terribly now from how much I moved while trying to grit my teeth through the pain that felt like my own arm was being sliced off.

"So you DO have a connection to the One." The masked figure said. "We suspected it but-" They slowly slid a scalpel they picked up across the beasts chest, "we couldn't be sure." 

Tears flooded my eyes at the pain I felt across my chest. The masked man continued slicing pieces out of the monster then using a salve that would instantly heal the injuries. It seemed to make the monsters pain stop but mine didn't. When the torturer picked up the monsters arm and seemingly glued it back on I knew things were either finished or about to get a lot worse.

They got worse.

I blacked out from the pain to find myself in a different room. The masked man stood over me while I was strapped to a different table. At least these straps didn't have barbs on them. Well.. that's what I thought until I saw the tools next to me now and the monster strapped up against the wall.

"Do you want to know what we call that?" The masked figure asked, nodding his head towards the creature. "It's name was just "Package" for awhile. But that didn't seem to fit. We changed it to "Infinity" when we learned what we can do to it."

I tried to get up enough spit to hock a loogie at him but my mouth was so dry. Instead, I just mean mugged him with all the disdain I could manage. I think he liked that though.

"We didn't mean for it to get out but LOOK! It's brought us a brand new toy to play with." He looked down at me and I could see the smile in his eyes. Suddenly and without warning I felt something plunge into my side. There was no pain. At least for me.

I looked over to see the creature on the wall howl in anguish, then I looked down to see a giant knife sticking out of my lung. 

"What the fuck..?" I said under my breath.

The masked man giggled excitedly and pulled the knife out. He cut the straps holding me down but I couldn't move from the pain still surging through my body from when this.. Infinity, was on the table. The man picked me up with one hand and flung me across the room where I slammed into the same wall the monster was on. I heard something crack and the monster bellowed out again.

He stalked towards us and I swear his mask turned into a sinister grin. He took turns stabbing one of us then slashing the other. We were literally being shredded apart while he just laughed.

The fun ended when he slashed the beasts throat and I couldn't breath anymore. He couldn't heal the monster fast enough and both of us lost consciousness. 

I woke up in a hospital bed with everyone I met in the break room standing around me.. besides Don.

"We tried to save you." Bake said, sadly.

"I thought they got rid of Tengu.. I'm so sorry he's the first one you had to meet." Nem said while running a hand through my hair.

Everyone else just stared down at me, waiting for a response that I couldn't give. It's been nine days since it happened and I still can't talk or swallow properly. Once I was out of the emergency holding area Tengu called for me every day until yesterday. Sometimes the monster was there, sometimes he injected me with something that made me feel my own pain again.

I mentioned I gained a lot of knowledge and there were some losses but this has gone on a little long so I'll save that for the next part. The gas has started in my room again. I'll update you if I am able to.
