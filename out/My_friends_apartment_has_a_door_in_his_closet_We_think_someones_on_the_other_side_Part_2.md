[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17y0jcz/my_friends_apartment_has_a_door_in_his_closet_we/)

So, here’s an update: we got tools, if you don’t know what I’m talking about my friend recently moved into an apartment and he has a strange door in his closet. We aren’t sure where it leads, and he’s been having weird stuff happen around the apartment.  
We decided to try and open it. first let me address some comments, some people were saying to prop a chair against the door or a doorstop but the door opens inward so they wouldn’t work. Josh has texted the Landlord asking about the door but she hasn’t replied.  
Grant went to his grandpa’s and took what he thought we needed, and we are planning on trying to open the door tonight.  
Yall, what the fuck? The door will not open! We took a hammer and tried to smash the screws out on our side so we could pry it open, but it didn’t do anything, if I’m being honest Josh is afraid of losing his safety deposit on the apartment. He doesn’t want damages, so we have to try and be careful.  
Josh first thought that the room could have led to another apartment on the back side of the complex. When he first moved in he found a key in the bathroom under one of the broken tiles and thinks maybe we should try to go to the other side and see if the key works on that door?  
We placed a small rag in between the door and the frame to try and hold it from shaking as we hit the screws with the hammer it… kinda worked.  
Mainly we just knocked a few dents into the door. Josh was not happy about it.  
After trying to open the door for a few hours we decided to run to McDonald’s and grab some food. We had left the washcloth in the door because we were going to come back and try some more but when we came back, I shit you not, the rag was not in the door anymore…  
It was on the counter… folded.  
Josh was scared and decided to crash at Grant's place tonight. We are going to try to go back over tomorrow morning and try to open the door again, hopefully the landlord can get back to Josh by then.  
I found a article about a guy that had a squatter living in his attic and thought about sending it to Josh but I don’t want to freak him out even more. Does anyone know the Laws in Tennessee when it comes to squatters?  
The part that creeps me out is where did those bruises and cuts on Josh’s back come from? No one could have done that, right? Maybe Josh did it to himself and just didn’t remember? I don’t really believe in paranormal stuff that much so I don’t think its anything like that but it is even more scary if someone that is flesh and blood did that to him and he didn’t even wake up…  
I don’t know what would be more terrifying though, if we opened the door and found someone, or we opened it and found nothing.
