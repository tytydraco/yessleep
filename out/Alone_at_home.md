This story may be a bit shorter than the other novels you may read on here, but I just wanted to tell this as this weird memory has popped into my head again.

So I live in a small town slightly outside of Stockholm, maybe 30 minutes away with a car or so. I live in a house, nothing too fancy and nothing that looks like it’s gonna break together. You could hear the floor creaking a bit when walking around, but again, it would not fall apart (Just to keep that in mind). My parents has had this house for over 20 years, even before I was born. We have just been renovating a lot so it looks more fresh, modern and welcoming. 

One evening I was home alone. It was basically pitch black outside with a ton of snow surrounding everything and the streetlights glowing this familiar light. It was winter, and I was maybe 11 at the time. My parents were both at some kind of dinner with their jobs. I have no siblings either, so I was completely alone. I never really had a babysitter growing up, besides my grandparents maybe once or twice, but no stranger in the house like some other people can do in other countries. My parents thought I was capable of taking care of myself, as I could cook some simple meals for myself and was a pretty calm kid.

I have just eaten dinner, and now maybe playing some games on my computer. Again, by myself. I have friends, but I have always been introverted and like being alone sometimes, it just felt nice. For some reason. My (very simple) setup was right next to my door that led out of my room, just to keep that in mind. 

I was in the middle of something before I heard something. It was like…heavy steps, slowly approaching my room. Or, it was the floor that creaked that slowly made its way to my room as if someone was walking. My eyes immediately darted to my closed door and paused the game. I thought it was from the game at first, but no. 

*bam…bam…bam……..bam*

The last step stopped right in front of my bedroom door. I could feel adrenaline and fear flow though me. Wasn’t I supposed to be home alone???

I stared at the door for what felt like an eternity, but nothing happened, it was quiet. I tried thinking of what it could be, but that was NOT one natural sound that houses made that’s for sure. I tried yelling, to see if my parents had came home without I noticed.

“Hello??”

..but no response. Completely quiet. I thought for a little while more, before I gathered encouragement and bravery before I reached over and grabbed a pair of sharp siccors and an envelope opener that actually was sharp on the tip. And looked like a dagger. 

I took those as weapons as I didn’t have anything better in my room to defend myself with, and very, very slowly opened my bedroom door. Who knew, maybe it COULD be someone that has broken in? I peaked out, and some lights were on as I left them on to feel safe. I looked towards my parents room, that was pitch black. 

Of course I did not have the balls to go there, so I went to look in the rest of the house. I had my siccors and sharp envelope opener tightly held in my hands as I looked around the house. Past the kitchen, living room, but nothing. I even looked in the entrance, but no one. We did have a basement too, but I did not have the balls to go down there either. Of course not.

Eventually, I started to let my guard down and relaxed a bit. It was no one in the house, nor something. I stood and thought about this though. What could it be?
I was alone, it was late, no one in the house except me and I heard steps outside my room… I was completely fine mentally that time too, so I wasn’t crazy.

It has gone some years, and I thought about this again.
