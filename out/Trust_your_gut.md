I swear tonight had serious The Hills Have Eyes vibes and I need to dump this somewhere or I will never be able to close my eyes without reliving everything. 

I live in Illinois, about 30 miles outside Chicago in the suburban area. On a clear day, you can stand on top of the hill in the forest preserve and see the city skyline. You can imagine it's pretty bright here at night with all the light pollution, you can barely see any stars. For this reason, my parents and I decided to drive about an hour and a half west to see the Northern Lights. If you've been on social media this weekend, you probably heard about the Rare Solar Geomagnetic Storm that is happening, and how you can see the aurora borealis as far south as southern IL. I've never seen the Northern Lights, and I'm an aspiring astronomer, so I wanted to see them.

Now, I have anxiety. I wanted to say this before I tell you everything that happened on this trip. This subreddit has a "go with your gut" mentality, and I don't ever trust my gut. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and sometimes I just get nervous for no reason. I'm saying this because when we arrived on a gravel road at 9:30 pm surrounded by farmland with only one house in sight, my stomach sank. I know this about myself, so I ignored my fear while I was sitting in the backseat, eyes trained outside the front windshield, my thoughts going through endless cycles of "We could ask the people in that house for help" "We might get hurt out here" "I hope we make it home safely" "Someone is watching us."

My mom pulled to the side of the road and we sat in the dark car for about 20 minutes, straining to look up at the sky through the closed windows until we got impatient and stepped out into the desolate night, the smell of cows in the air. My dad stayed in the car as my mom and I stood out in the empty road, my mom filming a time lapse of the sky on her phone and me pointing out constellations overhead. We could see Virgo and Ursa Major/The Big Dipper (both actually the same constellation, or at least one lies within the other).

Eventually my dad left the car to join us outside. I saw a shooting star and we watched the International Space Station zoom across the sky, which was really cool. We never actually saw the northern lights. We never got the chance, as we left about 15 minutes later. 

My dad and I were leaning against the hood of the car and my mom was standing in the middle of the road filming the sky when a light flashed all around us. My dad and I both started looking around us and I knew I wasn't somehow hallucinating. That happens sometimes, which I know me saying this might discredit my story, but I promise, my mom and dad both confirm that everything i say happened actually happened. My first thought was that it could be a camera flash. I was unsure about this though, I dabble in photography and a camera flash is pretty recognizable. It's usually a series of a couple flashes, one being longer and one being short. This was just one quick flash of light, and dimmer than a typical camera flash would be. Of course, it wasn't coming from in front of us so maybe that is why it was dimmer than that of a regular camera. All I know is if it was a camera flash, it wasn't a camera meant for photography as an art. More like a security or hunting type of camera. 

I immediately got back in the car. As I mentioned before, I have diagnosed anxiety and sometimes it manifests as paranoia and my dad joked about a sniper watching us earlier in the night, and that idea was in my head ever since then. The weird flash only solidified it more. My parents stayed out of the car still looking for any sign of celestial lights. A couple minutes after we saw the flash of light, a truck drove down the road coming from behind us. It turned around at the intersection ahead and it drove toward us slowly. Very slowly, like it was a predator stalking closer. All I could see was its bright headlights. Before the truck started driving toward us, my dad opened the passenger door and grabbed his handgun. I asked him if he found out what the flash of light was, I don't know if he actually registered what I said, but he just gave me an "mhm" confirmation. 

We were bathed in the light of the truck ahead of us, and I became extremely aware of eyes. Eyes in the fields, eyes in the rear view mirror, eyes outside the passenger side window. The eyes obviously had accompanying human figures, but just reflecting eyes showed on the silhouettes.  Humans don't have reflecting eyes, I know, but there could've been a totally reasonable explanation for that. Maybe every single pair of eyes wore glasses as well, and maybe those glasses happened to catch the light in the right way? I don't know. I just don't know.

My parents stood facing the truck, leaning against the hood of my mom's rusty minivan. They didn't seem to notice the surrounding group of people, or at least they didn't show it besides my dad grabbing his firearm a minute earlier. But I was having an anxiety attack, I'll be honest. I didn't have the mind to leave the car to tell them that we should leave.

I don't know what caused the driver of the truck to put it in reverse and drive back up the road. All I know is that the people surrounding us converged on the road ahead, walking up to the house in front of us. They completely ignored my parents standing out in the open. Maybe they saw an innocent husband and wife with their teenager in the car, staring at the star-filled sky, and decided that we weren't a threat. I don't know why they started watching us or why they let us leave, but I heard my mom say we should go home so I climbed from the drivers seat to the back and we wordlessly pulled out of the small farm town onto the highway.

It took 20 minutes of driving until we talked about what happened. My parents saw the people surrounding us, but they explained to me that they didn't want to do anything that made them see threatening. They didn't want to start anything accidentally. That's smart and level-headed thinking, but I want to think that they were scared frozen just as I was. None of us had a definitive answer for what the light was or why these people had reflective eyes. We just decided to not think of it. 

We got home at 11:20 pm. I looked up the town we went to, I guess it has a big meat industry. I'm not going to leave the town name, I don't want anyone from there to somehow connect this post back to who I am and... I don't know. Find me, I guess. I couldn't find anything peculiar whatsoever. I just have two backup eyewitness accounts confirming everything I saw, so I cant comfort myself into thinking it was my imagination. I just took some Benadryl hoping it will knock me out and I won't have swollen eyes tomorrow morning from being outside for so long today. 

I don't know if anyone will see this or if anyone can tell me that this all has some reasonable explanation, or maybe an explanation that is anything other that humanoid cannibals, but I just want peace of mind. And I just want to tell any readers to trust their gut. My anxiety has always kept me from branching out and doing fun things, but if standing on an empty country road at night trying to view a once in a lifetime celestial event might lead to getting ganged up on by people with glowing eyes, I think trusting my gut might be a good thing.
