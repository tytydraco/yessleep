I swear Friday night (or Saturday morning, I guess) had serious The Hills Have Eyes vibes and I need to dump this somewhere. I need help, I don't know how to make them leave me alone.

I live in Illinois, about 30 miles outside Chicago in the suburban area. On a clear day, you can stand on top of the hill in the forest preserve and see the city skyline. You can imagine it's pretty bright here at night with all the light pollution, you can barely see any stars. For this reason, my parents and I decided to drive about an hour and a half west to see the Northern Lights. If you've been on social media this weekend, you probably heard about the Rare Solar Geomagnetic Storm that is happening, and how you can see the aurora borealis as far south as southern IL. I've never seen the Northern Lights, and I'm an aspiring astronomer, so I wanted to see them.

Now, I have anxiety. I wanted to say this before I tell you everything that happened on this trip. This subreddit has a "go with your gut" mentality, and I don't ever trust my gut. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and sometimes I just get nervous for no reason. I'm saying this because when we arrived on a gravel road at 2 am surrounded by farmland with only one house in sight, my stomach sank. I know this about myself, so I ignored my fear while I was sitting in the backseat, eyes trained outside the front windshield, my thoughts going through endless cycles of "We could ask the people in that house for help" "We might get hurt out here" "I hope we make it home safely" "Someone is watching us."

My mom pulled to the side of the road and we sat in the dark car for about 20 minutes, straining to look up at the sky through the closed windows until we got impatient and stepped out into the desolate night, the smell of cows in the air. My dad stayed in the car as my mom and I stood out in the empty road, my mom filming a time lapse of the sky on her phone and me pointing out constellations overhead. We could see Virgo and Ursa Major/The Big Dipper (both actually the same constellation, or at least one lies within the other).

Eventually my dad left the car to join us outside. I saw a shooting star and we watched the International Space Station zoom across the sky, which was really cool. We never actually saw the northern lights. We never got the chance, as we left about 15 minutes later. 

My dad and I were leaning against the hood of the car and my mom was standing in the middle of the road filming the sky when a light flashed all around us. My dad and I both started looking around us. My first thought was that it could be a camera flash. I was unsure about this though, I dabble in photography and a camera flash is pretty recognizable. It's usually a series of a couple flashes, one being longer and one being short. This was just one quick flash of light, and dimmer than a typical camera flash would be. Of course, it wasn't coming from in front of us so maybe that is why it was dimmer than that of a regular camera. All I know is it wasn't a camera meant for casual photography. More like a security or hunting type of camera. 

I immediately got back in the car. As I mentioned before, I have diagnosed anxiety and sometimes it manifests as paranoia and my dad joked about a sniper watching us earlier in the night, and that idea was in my head ever since then. The weird flash only solidified it more. My parents stayed out of the car still looking for any sign of celestial lights. A couple minutes after we saw the flash of light, a truck drove down the road coming from behind us. It turned around at the intersection ahead and it drove toward us slowly. Very slowly, like it was a predator stalking closer. All I could see was its bright headlights. Before the truck started driving toward us, my dad opened the passenger door and grabbed his handgun. I asked him if he found out what the flash of light was, I don't know if he actually registered what I said, but he just gave me an "mhm" confirmation. 

We were bathed in the light of the truck ahead of us, and I became extremely aware of eyes. Eyes in the fields, eyes in the rear view mirror, eyes outside the passenger side window. The eyes obviously had accompanying human figures, but just reflecting eyes showed on the silhouettes. They surrounded us, looking like the stars from above fell and stood in the fields. 

My parents stood facing the truck, leaning against the hood of my mom's rusty minivan. They didn't seem to notice the surrounding group of people, or at least they didn't show it besides my dad grabbing his firearm a minute earlier. But I was having an anxiety attack, I'll be honest. I didn't have the mind to yell from the car that we should leave.

I don't know what caused the driver of the truck to put it in reverse and drive back up the road. All I know is that the eyes surrounding us converged on the road ahead, following the truck. They completely ignored my parents for whatever reason, and the headlights and eyes disappeared. We were alone again.

We thought that was the end of it. We left immediately when the headlights were out of view. We made a U-turn and drove home. We didn't speak of what just happened, and we got home at around 4:30 am. I took two Benadryl hoping to pass out and forget the eyes 

At 10 am, my mom was going to go grocery shopping and she found an envelope on the front porch. Inside the envelope was a photo of my dad and I leaning on the van, taken from the field beside us. My mom was blocked from view by the car, but you could somewhat see her through one of the windows. The quality was horrible, it was definitly taken on a trail camera of sorts. It wasn't really a photograph, more like a postcard. It had a logo that I reverse-image-searched, but I couldn't find anything. I remembered seeing a building with the logo on it as we were leaving, it had a name like "Long Pig Butcher Inc," but I couldn't remember it exactly. The logo looked like a dark circle with two white dots, like headlights at night.

My dad burned the postcard. The photo didn't save to my phone when I reverse-image-searched it, I accidentally chose to delete it and it didn't show up in my camera roll trash folder. As a family, we chose to ignore everything that happened. We thought we probably angered a farmer by trespassing and we didn't want to get in trouble by reporting it. We hoped everything would die down, but it didn't.

Saturday night, I had to go outside to close the chicken coop. I saw the eyes in the tree-line. It had to be 6 pairs of glowing white dots staring directly at me. I realized then that the logo wasn't depicting headlights. 

I ran inside to hide. The eyes moved from the tree-line to my back yard. They didn't move any further, they just stared. I could make out their silhouette bodies, but no distinguishable features. On the back window was another postcard with the same logo on it, stuck there with the wind. It blew away shortly after I saw it. 

This morning my parents were gone. I was alone in the house, and I kept seeing glowing eyes out of the corner of my vision. 

I want the eyes to go away. I want them to leave me alone. I didn't post the name of the town, I don't want them to take their staring to the next level. I see their eyes glowing through the blinds on all the windows. I hear the sound of a truck outside, and my parents haven't answered their phones.

I should've trusted my gut when we pulled onto that gravel road. I should've convinced my parents to drive home. The eyes won't leave me alone. They're watching me, always.
