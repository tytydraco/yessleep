Before I start, here's the link to [my last post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1b8hxu1/after_22_years_ive_decided_to_revisit_my_home_town/) It's Thursday now. I'll try to respond to some of you all this time. I couldn't last night for, surprisingly, unrelated reasons. I also didn't provide a name for myself last post. It doesn't matter much, but whatever. All my friends call my Mikey, so that's what we'll be going with from now on.

I'm no longer in the town as of the time I'm writing this. I have to personally apologize to u/Rainy-Melon. I'm stupid. and it was really stupid for me to go to the town, but I'm not staying in that place for another night. Tonight was the gravestone, and I am not willing to figure out what was going to happen. Especially after last night, which was the eyes. You had a good suggestion, but I think you would all appreciate if I made an update post. Maybe one day, in late December.

So, what happened? Where am I now? How much do my parents know? And have I found the truth? I'll answer this all out of order, staring with the middle 2, to what happened, and then about the truth. As of the time I am writing this post, I'm currently in a motel in Massachusetts. I needed time to think and rest after last night. I managed to grab my car, which wasn't taken thankfully despite being left completely unattended. I've also managed a stable internet and wi-fi connection again so, that's good.

I talked to my friend to tell her I was decently ok. She helped calm me down a bit, but my nerves were still frayed. After that, I went to contact my parents. I'd be lying if I said they told me anything of importance. But I told them everything. They weren't exactly angry but I could tell they weren't happy, either. We'll have a talk when I get home, and they promise to tell the truth. The entire truth. They think I deserve it.  


Before I continue, one last thing. To all the others who said something, yeah. This was a horrible idea. But call it stupidity, curiosity or whatever you want, I have my reasons for wanting to go to my hometown. I do regret this experience. I'm scared shitless, especially for tonight. I wasn't able to confirm if the dreams would only occur in the town's boundaries or not. But that was all background stuff, I'll start getting into what happened last night when I went to bed.  


I wasn't able to set up my phone to record last night, since my storage was full and couldn't record anymore. Sleep did find me pretty easily, despite my situation. I had another dream last night, it was similar to previous dream. I was in the sky, overlooking the town. It was night again, but this time, the town was littered with misshapen holes all over, going deep into the earth.  Suddenly, they all started blinking at me. The ground shifting organically, with invisible pupils tearing into me. I screamed at them, not in fear, but in agony. I felt my body starting to rip and be pulled apart, my everything twisted and shredded into strands of blood and bone. Think of it like being turned into spaghetti, but you have to watch every second of it. And yet, I didn't die. I was reduced to just my eyes. Of course it was just my eyes. I watched in now silent horror as those strands coalesced in front of me, twisting into a new form. The Stars fell before I could see this new form complete itself, though. A Star grabbed me again, and screeched at me. I could still hear. In fact, I could move. I was the Star for those final moments of the dream. I couldn't move or control myself though, as lucidity collapsed. I, or the Star, removed its eyes and replaced them with my own. The dream ended with it howling loudly.  


I woke up to that same howl outside, just as something large and heavy crashed into the street outside. I heard it scream and loudly scramble about before it just... died. I don't know how. I knew it was dead, but I wasn't sure why I knew it was dead. All I knew was that it was dead, it wouldn't be there when I went outside, and that I needed to leave now. So I grabbed my phone, packed up in a haste, left and booked it out of the house. I froze when I was out of the door. The street was littered with holes, small size and shapes of those in the dream. I swear one of them blinked and looked at me. I had to shake off the feeling of them watching me and just run. And those stupid staring people were back. They crawled out of some of the holes and started to sprint at me. I only looked back for a second, but there was a huge swarm of them running at me. I've got no good estimation of the amount of them, but they were loud. Louder than anything I've ever heard. I made it outside of the town limits before they could reach me. Damned sons of bitches stopped at the limits. They just stood there quietly, slowly turned around, and walked off.  


They did maintain their stare though. Their heads did a full 180 just so they could keep staring. I just stood there and watched as they walked away and fell into the holes in the street, vanishing. I didn't stick around for long though, I started running again and went to where my car was left. And then I drove. That was earlier this morning. I've gotten a chance to look myself over now.  


I look terrible.   


My hair is in a mess, and there's patches that just seem to have been ripped out. My skin is covered in these thin lines and spirals all over, never crossing but always remaining about the same thickness. Its likes I got cuts all over again, but this time they healed and became scars. It all hurts like a bitch. Its constant, but just in the background.   


And my eyes. They aren't mine anymore. My eyes were brown before, but now, they're this yellow, and my pupil itself is completely different. It's rectangular, like a goat's. And the whites of my eyes aren't white anymore, they're this murky grey. If I was smaller and could reach into my own eye, it looks like it would feel like dipping my hands into mud. My vision itself didn't change, which it should probably have, just how my eyes look. I think I actually swapped eyes with one of those Star things. I touched one of them out of curiosity and... I couldn't feel it. It was in the socket, and I can see through it, but something isn't connecting it to my nervous system.   


I'll get back on the move tomorrow, my goal is to make it the remaining 8-ish hour trip back. Get my answers. Maybe make one final update to help conclude everything. But there's one last thing bugging me.  


I feel like I've been hearing that howl throughout the day.  


I'll see you all again soon, after I have my answers. Until then, stay safe you all. Mikey, over and out.  


Oh and, one last thing. Maybe don't wish on a star tonight.
