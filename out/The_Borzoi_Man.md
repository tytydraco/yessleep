I had committed the route to and from my friend’s house to memory by the time I was twelve. We went there as a family pretty much every weekend. It was about a 30 minute drive. Pretty damn far for a kid my age. I couldn’t do much else in the car but look at the road ahead, because I got carsick if I looked at my phone for any longer than a few minutes. Thus, the route was forever burned into my mind.

That summer, the summer I turned twelve, we would visit that family a *lot.* We often joked that we practically lived at their house at that point, considering we ate half our dinners there. It was nice. My sibling and I got to play on their Playstation and my parents got to sit on the porch and have a couple beers with their friends. A win-win. 

We’d stay for a *while,* too. Sometimes all the way until midnight. We’d have so much fun that we’d lose track of time, only realizing when the youngest in the family started to fall asleep. We’d pack up our stuff and head off into the warm, humid summer night, lamenting the fact that we had to leave at all.

The night it happened, it was raining. The car’s digital clock flashed 11:14 as the car started up.

I always loved riding in the car at night. It usually meant we were headed home from somewhere, which was always nice. I could get in bed, lie back, relax, and put all the day’s events behind me as I drifted off to sleep. I just found it so… calming. The lights of the highway would speckle the road ahead of us, and even though I knew it was just more cars I always loved how it looked. Due to the light pollution, it was the closest I could get to a starry sky. I’d rest my head against the car window and watch the lights fly by. It was nice, and the sound of the rain made it even nicer. 

There was one stretch of road, though, that always grabbed my attention. It was right after the exit ramp we would use to get off the freeway. There was a park off to the left, a big, open field of grass surrounded by woods. An old, rusted swing set sat in the center next to a filthy slide and some worn-down monkey bars. They weren’t even over any wood chips - just more grass. It was incredibly unsafe. I wasn’t sure why the town hadn’t just torn it down already.

During the daytime, this was just a normal, run-down playground in a big field. There was nothing special about it. Sometimes we’d see kids playing in the grass, or someone playing fetch with their dog. It was your average park. But at night, when the streetlamps and moonlight were the only things illuminating it, the park transformed into something else. Shrouded in darkness, the field seemed to stretch on for miles, and the forest surrounding it was nothing more than a deep, black void. I was never that scared of the dark as a kid, but this park always unsettled me. I’d always look out the window and imagine seeing something there, something inhuman and terrifying. I’d see it, it’d see me, and then we’d drive past and I’d never see it again. There was something so intoxicating about the idea. Something terrifying about it, too.

This night was no different. As we took the exit ramp off the freeway, my mind’s eye conjured up images of the park, populated by countless otherworldly denizens. A tall, lanky thing stood atop the monkey bars. A gigantic man bounded across the treetops, staring down at me from afar. A thing with a head bigger than the rest of its body dragged itself across the grass. The thought sent shivers down my spine.

I was always a very imaginative child. That’s why I still sometimes wonder if what I saw was even real to begin with.

As the park came into view, the shapes of the playground blurred by the raindrops running down the side window, I saw something. A pale lump of *something* sprawled out across the grass. My eyes widened and I pushed my face up against the glass. My worries about seeing something terrifying in the darkness gave way to curiosity in an instant. 

The closer our car got, the better I could make the figure out. Long limbs covered in thin white hairs. A long snout jutting out from its face. It was a dog. The poor thing was out all alone in the rain, shaking like a leaf. At least, I thought it was shaking -- hard to make out through the darkness. From the looks of it, it was a Borzoi. If you haven’t seen one before, look it up. They’re goofy looking dogs, with long legs and even longer snouts. It’s like they were built wrong. And this dog *certainly* fit the bill.

But as our car got even closer, just about to the point where we were right up next to it, something started to feel *off* about the dog. I couldn’t put my finger on why, but the way it was laying down didn’t look natural -- not even for a dog *that* sick. Its paws weren’t bent in the right places. Its spine didn’t curve in the way that a dog’s normally would. Just as we passed it by, it raised its head in an instant and turned to face us.

It was as if a man’s face was stretched over the skull of a dog. Human eyes stared dead ahead, the pupils nothing but pinpricks in a sea of pale blue. The nose, stretched beyond its breaking point, went down the length of the snout before terminating in two large, stretched-out nostrils. Its lips jutted out the front of the snout, cracked and bleeding, peeled back to show a mouth full of human teeth. Its tongue lolled out of its mouth, glistening with saliva in the fragments of moonlight that peeked out from the gaps in the clouds. The raindrops on the window distorted its face, twisting the already grotesque form into something truly indescribable. My heart stopped, and my blood ran cold.

And then it got up.

The Borzoi Man raised itself on unsteady legs, elbows and knees bent backwards. I could tell now why its paws looked wrong. They weren’t paws at all, but human hands and feet, thin white hairs dusting its fingers and toes from the knuckles up to its long, yellowed nails. As we passed it by, its whole body twitched, and its limbs suddenly propelled itself forward. It galloped towards us on all fours. I couldn’t scream, I couldn’t cry, I could only watch as this thing chased after us, mouth wide open. We were faster, thank God, but it certainly tried its hardest to keep up. I turned my head as far as it could go, just barely able to see it through the back window out of the car. It was obscured by raindrops, a writhing, galloping mass of pale skin and thick white hairs slowly receding back into the darkness.

It took me another minute before I could say anything, and as soon as I tried, I broke down in tears. I babbled incoherently: There was a dog, but he wasn’t a dog, and he was chasing us, and he was all wrong, and he was hairy and sick, and his face was weird and his arms bent weird - it was nonsense. 

My parents found a sensible enough explanation for it - some random dude, probably on drugs or something, chased after our car. And I was tired from a long night playing with my friends, so I was probably just seeing things. 

Most people probably would have resisted this explanation. It’s hard to discount your own senses like that. Yet I was desperate for some way to discount what I saw. It took my family the whole car ride to convince me in my frantic state, but once I calmed down I found myself agreeing with them. I was tired, and there *was* a pretty big drug problem in our neighborhood, so it made at least a little sense that I had some kind of mild hallucination that turned some druggie into a terrible monster.

I *had* to believe it. Because if what I’d seen was real…

Unsurprisingly, I had a lot of trouble getting to sleep when I got home that night. Every time I closed my eyes I could see the Borzoi Man’s face, skin tearing from the tension of being stretched across a body that wasn’t built for it. I could smell its breath, hot and rancid. I could hear its labored breathing as it bounded towards us through the darkness. What if it followed us? What if it chased us, just barely out of our sight, all the way home?

I kept replaying my parents’ words of reassurance over and over in my head. *You’re tired. You’re exhausted. You’re seeing things. It was just a man. There’s nothing to worry about.* I tried my absolute hardest to fool myself into believing what they had told me. After an hour of deep breaths and frantic rationalization, I had done it. I’d tricked myself. Relief washed over me.

Eventually, exhaustion took me over, and the gentle pitter-patter of raindrops on the roof lulled me to sleep. I had the most pleasant dream, though I can’t remember what it was about.

The dream didn’t last. I awoke suddenly in the middle of the night to an unbearable stench. It’s hard to describe — sickly sweet, a mix of mud and blood and perfume and rotten fruit. It’s hard to identify a smell when you don’t know the source, and I did *not* want to know where this was coming from. I would’ve just gone back to sleep, but it was too intense to ignore. Maybe it was an issue with our plumbing. Maybe I could wake up my mom and ask her what was going on.

My eyes fluttered open and slowly adjusted to the darkness of my room. I always sleep on my left side, facing the window. Rain beat against the roof of the house. The storm had grown more intense since I fell asleep. I was about to get out of bed and make my way towards the door when I noticed something strange glinting in the darkness of the window. They were far too big to be raindrops stuck to the glass. I sat up and squinted. 

It wasn’t until I noticed the fingers gripping the outer edges of the windowsill that I knew what I was looking at.

The glint of its eyes.

It stood, shrouded in darkness, right outside my window. Its body was soaked, masses of matted fur covering most of its face. Only its eyes remained completely uncovered. I could just barely make out its pupils moving, scanning the room. Could it not see me? Did it not know I was in here? It pressed its nose against the window and sniffed, as if it was trying to track my scent through the glass. I heard a sickening crunch as it pressed its nose further, mashing it into nothing more than a mangled mess of cartilage. Blood dripped down the glass. The window creaked.

Another wave of that horrible smell washed over me. It was even stronger this time. I doubled over as soon as I smelled it, vomiting all over my quilt. I could hear it sniffing outside the window — or at least *trying* to sniff, as the blood pooling against its nose was snorted back down into its throat. It had caught wind of the scent of my vomit through the glass.

It was clawing at the window now, long nails scraping criss-crossing patterns of little white lines, whining like a spoiled dog begging for table scraps the whole time. It wanted so badly to get through that window and do… whatever it was trying to do to me. Probably eat me, maybe tear me apart too for good measure. I didn’t know and I didn’t care. This thing was trying to *get* me. I hid under the vomit-stained covers, tears streaming down my cheeks.

Thinking back on it, I should have ran. Booked it to my parents’ room and screamed as loud as I could. But I knew they wouldn’t believe me. That man couldn’t have tracked us down, no way. They’d say I was just imagining things.

After all, how could it be standing outside my window when my room was on the second story?

The scratching stopped after a minute or so, but I didn’t dare look out the window to see if it had left. I couldn’t bring myself to pull my head out from under the blankets. I was terrified that maybe, somehow, it had gotten into my room. That it had forced the window open and crawled into my room, and now it was standing over my bed, leering down at the shivering mass underneath the covers. I could almost *feel* the spit dripping from its tongue onto the covers. Maybe if I just stayed still it would go away. Back through the window, up the driveway, and away from my house.

A loud *thud* reverberated through the room and startled me into pulling down the covers. Images of the thing staring me down from the other side of the window. All I saw when I looked, however, was a smear of blood. Not long after that I heard the second *thud,* and then the skittering of nails across pavement. I rushed to the window, nearly tripping over my own feet, and stared out at the driveway. Nothing. The Borzoi Man must have retreated back up the driveway and down the street.

I never told my parents about that encounter. That night I put my sheets in the wash, left the window open to air out the faint hints of that horrible stench that still permeated my room, and then just… sat there on the floor, crying. I’d just tell them the blood on the window was a bird that had hit it overnight. I didn’t want to tell them what had happened, I just wanted this all to be over. I wanted to bury whatever this *thing* was deep into my memory, so deep that I’d never think about it ever again. It would’ve worked, if not for a single, disturbing fact — one that still makes my stomach churn thinking about it. 

For the rest of the time I lived at that house, my room smelled like wet dog.

And I was the only one who could smell it.
