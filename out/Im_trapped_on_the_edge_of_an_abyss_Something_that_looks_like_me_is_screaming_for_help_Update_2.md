In her last days, my mother was an abstract painting.

You know how you can look at one and sort of make out something familiar? A shape that looks like an object or a collage of colors that make up a landscape? That part was her.

Despite her lack of hair or how frail she’d gotten, her face was unmistakable. Her smile as I entered the room; I could place it no matter how different she looked.

The tubes sticking out of her though? The hospital gown framing her neck up and the sterile room surrounding us? That was all the rest. The jumble of confusing shapes that were impossible to process.

“Hey, little Hen…” Mom said with that familiar smile, re-grounding me. Her head rolled weakly across her pillow to better take me in, and I saw her hand attempt to lift from her mattress. I quickly moved over to take it so that she wouldn’t have to.

Working at my best smile, I said, “Hey, Mom. How are you feeling?”

It was a stupid question to ask. I knew the answer. Still, for a girl my age so lost in the confusion of what was going on, it was all I could think to offer.

Mom still made an effort to reassure me, “Oh, good. I’m doing just fine. Even snacked a bit like I told you I would.” She added with a wink.

I snickered softly and nodded, running my fingers over the back of her boney hand. I tried to focus on its warmth and not on the cold plastic tube that snaked across it.

We fell into silence for a long beat of time, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. We were sort of used to it by now. After so many nights in this room with nothing to do but talk, we’d pretty much eaten up any conversation left to be had. Now, just our presence was what sustained us, and that was usually more than enough. Still, one could only take so much, so, trying to break it, I turned to one of our other forms of entertainment.

Reaching to her side table, I grabbed the plain paperback from the hospital gift shop and held it up, “Well, what do you think? Want to chug on? I know you’re just *dying* to know what happens to Brad and Marissa.”

Mom chuckled softly at my comment. The book had become a sort of hate-read situation. I’d picked it up thinking the cover looked interesting, but didn’t realize it was a cheesy romance book in disguise. Still, Mom and I found ourselves laughing through it together, and these days, that laugh was in low supply. I was getting ready to open up where I’d bookmarked our spot before she could even answer, but then she spoke again.

“Actually, honey, I thought we might just talk tonight.”

I didn’t peel my eyes up from the novel. A lump instantly formed in my throat, and I pursed my lips, trying to hide my emotions. I knew right away that whatever she wanted to talk about was bad news. It was in the way that she said it; softly and unassuming. The second red flag was that Dad hadn’t come in to visit with me, and it was rare that he’d ever miss the chance. I think I’d known something was wrong the moment I’d entered her room, but I was hoping if I just powered through, I wouldn’t have to acknowledge it.

“Sure,” I pretended, faking a smile. I finally was able to pull my eyes up to meet hers, “What do you want to talk about?”

Mom painfully lifted her hand and placed it over mine, squeezing with all she had. As hard as it was for me to face her, I could tell it was even harder for her to confront me. She smiled so proudly at me, but her eyes told a different story.

Desperately, she shook her head and wistfully spoke, “My little hen…”

“Mom…” I returned softly, not wanting to break just yet. I hadn’t even needed to ask; I knew what she wanted to speak about.

She took a deep breath and prepared herself, “Honey, your dad and I… the doctors gave us an update today…”

I tried to stop the tears from fully flowing out of my eyes, but I was too weak to fight them. I eyed the thin blanket atop her lap while I blinked them out and softly spoke, hoarse and cracked, “Mom, please don’t…”

I could hear the words pause in her mouth as she thought, but the silence that followed said everything.

“Can… can we not talk about this right now?” I begged, raising my head to face her, “I-I’m sorry, I just… I just…”

I couldn’t even give a reason. My words fizzled like a suffocating flame and I devolved into soft sniffles as my sleeves worked tirelessly to keep my cheeks dry. It was selfish of me to have done that to her. Shut her down like that. I could tell how much it hurt her, but like I said, I was young and so lost. The way she so patiently smiled and nodded her head in affirmation broke my heart. I could see the weight that it kept on her shoulders.

She was so strong. I wish I could have been stronger for her.

“Of course, honey,” She told me, letting go of my hand and raising it higher to my face. I was just out of reach, so I leaned in for her sake and shut my eyes tight, squeezing free the last drops of water that had slipped through the cracks.

“My little hen,” she pondered again, erasing the wet sting away with her thumb, “It’s going to be okay, honey. You’re going to be okay.”

“I don’t think I am, Mom,” I told her, my voice barely a whisper.

She sat in silence for a long while, just holding me softly while I calmed down. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, she spoke, “Did I ever tell you what we almost named you?”

I opened my eyes and looked at her with a sniffle before shaking my head.

“Hope,” she said warmly.

“You really liked your ‘H’ names, huh?” I snickered.

Mom chuckled along before continuing, “It was a scary time, being pregnant with you. Your Dad and I weren’t doing too well off on money; we’d just put a lot down on a new place. He was between jobs and I was out of work. I didn’t know how we were going to make it, and looking into that unknown was terrifying.”

Mom’s voice caught in her throat, and she fell into a fit of rough coughs for a spell. I waited patiently for it to pass in silence.

“But I was excited too. Excited to meet you. To watch you grow, no matter what the cost was. So, I decided I wanted to name you hope. That way, no matter how bad things got once you came out, even when I felt at my lowest, I always had my little hope to remind me it’d be okay.”

I didn’t have words to respond with. I didn’t really know how. Both of my hands were cupping hers at that point, so I pulled it to my mouth and kissed it, fighting back tears.

Being the bashful teen I was, I took the deflective way out, “That’s so cheesy, Mom.” I told her with a snicker.

That made her laugh, which sparked me to laugh a little more confidently. She removed her hand from mine, then brushed a strand of hair from my face, “Maybe. But it’s still true to this day.”

I smiled at her, letting a single tear break loose from its prison, then shook my head. I stared at my mom for a long time after that, admiring the parts of the painting that felt familiar and safe. Finally, when it felt like I’d stared too long, I softly spoke.

 “So after all of that planning, you still named me ‘Hensley’ of all things?”

Mom slipped into another chuckle and shrugged, “Once you came out, we thought you looked more like a Hensley.”

I probably didn’t need to recount that memory in so much detail. I’m sorry for that. The boredom and solemness of this place has a way of resurrecting dead memories. I’d prefer to not dance with them, but it’s hard when it’s so silent. I think writing them has a way of helping me vent it, though.

All of that aside, however, I bring all of it up because I promise it will be relevant in a few minutes.

After my last post, I spent the next day held up under my usual desk. The thing has practically become my new home. With a flashlight now, I was able to find some cushions from a couch in the breakroom and toss them under there, making it a lot more comfy. They're dusty and old like everything else around here, but beggars can’t be choosers.

For the entire time under there, I popped open the laptop I’d found upstairs and began guessing passwords. There wasn’t much else to do at the moment; I still wasn’t confident enough to go outside and look for clues, and thankfully, there wasn’t an attempt limit on the device. Plus, if there were any answers to be had about what was going on, they had to be on this hunk of junk.

The problem was, obviously, that I had no clue where to begin. My only clues were ‘kingfisher’, the note I found, and the names Juarez and Dr. Brand. At first, I just tried punching in random ideas related to those things, or phrases on the note, but when that didn’t work for around an hour, I began getting more desperate.

Maybe it was boredom, or maybe it was just pure insanity, but eventually, I started looking for secret codes hidden in the letter. My train of thought was that since I had been whisked here by accident, surely there had to have been others along the way as well, right? And if that was the case, then wouldn’t the scientist who left the note know that and leave clues on how to get out?

I know it was pure crazy conspiracy, but like I said, I was desperate. I knew that there were answers waiting for me on the other side of the pitiful blank text box, and it irked me that the only thing in my way was a few presses on the keyboard.

Finally, after the better part of a day trying, I gave up and decided to look around once more. I hadn’t been back to the radio room since I’d gotten my phone’s flashlight back, as I desperately wanted to avoid the rancid smell. I wasn’t certain that it’d make me throw up again, but after the blood riddled viscera that came out of me back at the cliff face door, I really didn’t want to risk anything until I’d let food settle in my stomach for longer.

After so long of not eating, especially given my current… *condition*, I was worried that I may have done some serious damage to my internals. Throwing up blood was never a good sign, let alone a chunk of flesh with it. The thought made my stomach prickle with pain, and my body shivered with discomfort. I tried not to think about it. I just needed it to not happen again, was all.

I was ready now, though; collected and confident. Standing, I began heading for the door but as I reached for the handle, something stopped me.

A noise from outside.

At first I thought it was nothing. My ears playing tricks on me or something. That had been happening a lot when the only sounds in this place were my own breathing and the building settling.

Well, at least when there wasn’t a creature on the shelf with me…

As I paused to listen however, I heard it again, clearer this time.

“Hello?”

It was still faint; far away and coming from the cliff side of the plateau. Spinning on my heels, I turned to make a beeline for my desk, but then paused in a crouch as my eyes skimmed the dark windows. Slow and low, I moved closer to them.

The light to the radio tower was currently off. I’d learned that if I looked at the building across from me, I could see the dim red glow from the tower reflecting in its windows and scattering across its cold exterior. It was how I could see its status without having to be up in the main room. Like I said though, it was off; dead as the man in the room below it.

And yet, I heard the call again. Something out there saying, “Hello? I-Is anyone there? I’m really freaking out.”

It was getting closer, and the thought made me shiver, looking out over the dark streets. My brain began running wild. The person sounded human, but that really meant nothing considering my first encounter here was a beast that could mimic human speech. This sounded real, though, not that warbled, plain talk that the angler had been doing. Whatever was out there sounded terrified, and it was doing a damn good job of spreading it to me.

Then again, what if it actually was another person? I was just thinking earlier that there had to have been other travelers of the road that accidentally found themselves in this place. How was I so certain that it couldn’t be another poor survivor that just rolled into town and was doing the exact same thing I had done on my first night? The thought of companionship flooded my heart and made my veins pump faster with adrenaline as I was torn between two extremes.

Then the person spoke again, and my whole body went numb.

“Please, somebody answer me! I-I’m cold and alone and…”

Her voice trailed off, but its sound was unmistakable. Her cadence, her tone, the way she said her words. It sounded strange to my ears, but I suppose it’s the same effect when you hear it in recordings. This wasn’t a recording, however, which only made it sound more impossible.

The person calling out sounded *exactly* like me.

My heart was back to pounding. They were getting closer now as they called out again, and I ducked lower beneath the windowsill, panting hard as I stared at the dark ahead of me. It had to be a creature. There’s no way it wasn’t. No stranger could sound *that* similar to me. Even if the light wasn’t on I refused to believe it.

How did I know the light thing was accurate anyway? That info came from one of the people who made this place, and since when did I trust their input? They were the reason I was trapped here in the first place. The guy upstairs had died, and he was right below the tower. Surely if the light had come on to warn him, he wouldn’t have stayed there, right?

“P-Please… somebody?” I heard myself wine out from the end of the block now. Her voice was quivering and I could hear it hiding tears, “Anyone?”

  Now, I have to admit, I’m not the biggest fan of myself. I’m a pretty shitty person who hasn’t always done the best things, and I’ve hurt a lot of people with those actions. Hell, even me being here was a consequence of those choices; the ‘road trip’ and all that. When I first got here, part of me thought I’d finally died and ended up in my own personal hell.

Hearing my own voice in a place full of bloodthirsty monsters on the edge of an abyss, I know I should have ignored it. It’s pleading shouldn’t have had any effect on me given my own self-loathing. But at the same time, it *was* my voice, and I knew it better than anyone. I could tell when I sounded genuinely scared and desperate, and the voice out there certainly fit the bill.

Slowly, I climbed to my feet, snapping a pocket knife from my bag open, just in case.

The other me continued to call out as I made for the lobby, stopping far from the glass doors and peering out into the street. They were nearly here, and now that I was standing face to face with the ground floor, I felt unbearably vulnerable. My fist white-knuckled the dagger inside of it, and I held my phone at the ready, my thumb hovering over the flashlight icon as I battled with myself in my head.

Was I really doing this? Was this a good idea?

“Hello?” I called out before I could think about it any harder.

I needed to know. Even if it killed me, I needed to know.

“H-Hello?” the voice quickly responded, “Oh, thank God! Hello?”

I heard footsteps pattering through the street and nearing my position, so, gritting my teeth and turning my eyes toward the ceiling in regret, I turned the flashlight on.

The beam barely reached the front door, but it was enough to stop the figure that I saw running through the street. They put on the breaks hard, then turned toward the glass doors, shielding their eyes from the harsh light within.

“Hello? Is somebody there?” she asked. Still my voice. Still perfectly matching my tone.

It took me a long beat to build the courage to speak, “Who… who are you?” I asked sternly, trying to sound as imposing as possible. It probably didn’t work with how petrified I was.

“Um, m-my name is Hensley,” she stuttered out frantically, “I-I’m sorry to bother you, but I think I’m lost? I don’t know what this place is, and I-I just woke up here, and I don’t remember—”

The rest of her words faded to the background of my mind at the mention of her name. More importantly, *my* name. This… this had to be a trap. It had to be some sort of test set up by this place. Because if it wasn’t, then that meant the person outside…

“W-Woke up?” I interrupted shakily. “What do you mean, woke up, where did you come from?”

The other girl outside paused, and I could see her fold into herself a bit, “I’m sorry, I don’t know—I just woke up in an alleyway or something—I’ll leave, I swear, I just need to know where my car is. I think something happened, I-I—”

God, my voice was annoying. I couldn’t stand her constant stuttering, and maybe it was just my internal panic taking the reins, but a bit of frustration began to take hold too. I was scared out of my mind and just wanted to know what the hell was going on.

“Stop.” I demanded, “Slow it down. What’s going on? What happened to you?”

The girl’s slouched stance straightened out, and I saw her curiously step closer, “W-wait a second, you sound like…”

“Answer the question!” I said more sternly.

“Oh, u-um, I don’t know! Like I said, I just woke up. The last thing I remember is driving into this town, but then I think I blacked out or something? The next thing I know, I woke up in this back alley, and I was completely naked and the power was out everywhere and—I’m just really scared. Please, ma’am, I think I’m in trouble; I just need some held and then I’ll—”

“Naked? Why are you naked?” I asked her.

She tossed her hands up, “I don’t know! I just told you all I can remember! I-I took some clothes from a store for now and I can give them back, but i-it’s so cold out here! And this place looks like it’s falling apart and abandoned and I just want to get out, so *please.* Just help me find my car; I can’t see.”

I didn’t respond for a moment. I just chewed on what she said over and over in my head. Ultimately I came to only one thought. I needed to know one last thing to form my theory. I began moving closer.

The girl shielded her eyes as my light drew near, but when she put her hands down and her face came into view, I froze again, my knees feeling weak and wobbly.

There, standing in the street, was a girl looking weak and worn, her body far too frail to fit into the mismatched clothes she’d hastily thrown on. Her long hair was wild and tattered, and her posture was the image of exhaustion. Confusion froze her face as she stared at me, her soft eyes quivering with uncertainty as she looked on in suspense.

She was the spitting image of myself.

“M-Ma’am, please…” I saw myself say, vicious nausea brewing in my stomach.

I was speechless. I couldn’t move. There was an exact clone of me standing only 10 feet away with nothing but a glass barrier between us. If I didn’t know any better, I’d think I was looking in a mirror. After everything I’d seen so far, you’d think I’d be used to the insanity, but even this was too crazy for me to parse.

The other me began shifting softly under my silent stare, nerves taking hold of her. Her desperation had finally fizzled in place of fear for the strange figure on the other side of the door, and she took a step back.

“N-nevermind. I’ll just go—thank you for—”

“Wait!” I blurted. I know I should have just let her walk away. This couldn’t lead to anything good. But if there was another me roaming around, I needed to know why. Where she came from.

She stopped and faced me, then planted her feet, hope once again returning to her desperate eyes.

“What… what are you?” I asked in a low mutter.

Her face went puzzled, “I’m sorry?”

“*what are you?*” I asked a little more firm this time, panic lacing my words.

Hensley 2 shied away a little bit before shaking her head, “I-I don’t know—I’m just some random person? Just some girl—I don’t get what you mean!”

I didn’t really know how to explain what I meant either, given the circumstances, so slowly, I turned my light on myself and cast it over my face. I couldn’t see her expression anymore in the dark, but I definitely saw her back away in shock.

“W-What the hell!?” she cried. Her head swished side to side, looking down the dark street. It seemed like she was deciding whether or not to run, but the darkness must have been more foreboding to her. Instead, she chose to take another step back, then speak again. “W-What is this? What’s going on?”

“I’m trying to figure out the same thing,” I told her shakily, turning the light back to her face.

Her breathing picked up as she began hyperventilating, “Is this some sort of joke? Is this a nightmare?”

I couldn’t give her an answer, my brain still in denial. Narrowing my eyes, I began to scrutinize her. I was more confused than anything at this point. I still believed all of this to be some sort of trap or set up, but if it was, her acting was incredible. She genuinely seemed like she was in desperate need of help, and if I refused to do so, then I might just be condemning ‘myself’ to death.

What were the ramifications of that anyway? If this girl really was me, and she died, then… did that effect me too? Was I her? Was this some sort of time paradox thing? It was a crazy conclusion to jump to, but until you’re staring yourself in the eyes, it’s hard to rationalize a perfect copy of yourself. I was already in another dimension it seemed; was that theory really so far-fetched?

Realizing I wasn’t getting any answers just staring at her, I ran back what she’d told me in her head and decided to try and get more answers.

“The alley,” I began with a hard swallow, “you said you woke up in an alley; where at in town?”

The other me didn’t respond. She just let out a soft whimper.

Right; she said she’d just woken up after ‘entering town’. This was her first instance of paranormal happenings. I needed to ease her into this more.

“Listen, it’s going to be okay,” I reassured, “I’m not sure what’s going on either, but this place we’re in isn’t exactly safe. I can help you, but I need to know I can trust you first. Now, can you tell me exactly where you woke up?”

Other Hensley huffed out a few more shivering whimpers then nodded, “I-I, um, don’t know. It was by the cliff over there, I think? There was a giant metal door behind me and a bright light?”

A chill shot through me. She’d come from the door. Had she come *out* of it? Apparently she wanted to know the same.

“Is this some sort of experiment? Did they do something to me in there?”

An experiment? That might actually make sense. Maybe the people in this place before me still had scientists on the other side watching me. They almost certainly had surveillance over this place if they were conducting work here. Was this some sort of test they were running?

“Anything else?” I asked, “Any details at all?”

The girl made a small noise of desperate thought, trying hard to appease me. Finally she offered a small, “I-I think there was blood? I woke up in a puddle of blood, but I don’t have any cuts on me that I know of.”

The world felt like it dropped out from under me, and my hand instinctively reached for my stomach. It churned and stung as the other Me’s words echoed through my mind. I’d seen a puddle of blood by that door too. In fact, I’d been the one that made it. I made it when I threw up the meaty wad of flesh from inside my stomach.

Was this girl implying that she’d come from… had that thing grown into…

What the fuck was going on?

I must have been breathing very hard, because my homunculus friend called out again, “Is everything alright? A-are you okay?”

That humming buzz of danger set on the air again. If the thing in front of me had somehow grown in my gut once I entered this place then got spat out, then I still had no clue what it was. It could be me, sure, but it could also be something born of this place. An alien hatched from my innards with ill intent. It certainly hadn’t felt good coming out.

The feeling only compounded when a flicker of red lit the wall behind her.

 My eyes snapped to the adjacent building, and my chest grew tight. Reflecting in the black windows, I could see the radio tower light on. For a moment, I wondered if it somehow came on because, like the angler, this thing knew that the jig was up, but then I heard music began fading in from the edge of the shelf.

It was crackly and grating, a high-pitched jingle of a children's song. It almost sounded like a broken ice-cream truck radio. Other Hensley turned her head down the street toward it, and her expression looked beyond confused.

“What… is that?” She asked slowly.

My heart thundered in my chest while my brain made calculations. Something was on the plateau, and it was about to start hunting. If I left this clone of me outside, she was sure to die. If she was a monster, then that was a good thing. Problem taken care of. If she wasn’t, though? I was condemning an innocent woman to death. A horrible one at that, based on what I'd seen of these things so far.

I needed to make a choice, and fast. Once I brought this girl into the building with me, if she was a threat, she would have me cornered, and I was certain my dinky little knife wasn’t going to do much. When she looked back at me, though, and I could see the desperate look on her face? The way the light reflected in my eyes?

I never liked much about my own appearance, but I was always told I had my mother's eyes…

“Get in here.” I told her, “Now.”

She furrowed her brow, “What’s happening? What’s going—”

“Get inside now before I change my mind! B-But keep your distance! I have a knife.”

“That’s not very reassuring—”

“Listen, do you remember five seconds ago when I said this place was dangerous? That noise is one of the reasons why. Not get in here or you’re going to die.”

That was enough to put a fire under her feet. Hensley 2 gave one last look toward the music, then pushed through the doors. My heart jumped as the barrier between us was pulled away and I was faced with the full truth of my clone, but there was no time to fixate on it. I needed to move.

“Follow me,” I said.

 The ice-cream music scored our ascent, droning maddeningly into the dark of the town as it crested the ledge and began lurking the streets. I was already to my desk by the time I entered the office room, and other Hensley followed.

“Pick a desk and hide under it,” I told her.

She obeyed without hesitation.

Once we were both under, we sat in the dark and listened to the sound of our own breathing. The new creature in town spent nearly a full day on the shelf, scuttling the streets and clambering through windows.

I think the other me was still skeptical of everything, but that was okay, because I still was towards her. I never let my gaze fall away from her one time while we waited. Her skepticism dropped fast, however, when the thing came down our road and paused just beneath the window.

The music was blaring and loud up close, and I genuinely had to cover my ears; it began to hurt so bad. My body shook as the beast paused just below where the front door was. It must have smelled my new friend where she’d stopped, at least, that was my guess. Could these beasts even smell like dogs could? I still barely knew anything about them. This one was playing music like it was mechanical, but what happened next sounded the opposite.

The music abruptly stopped, then began to wind backwards. Its broken melodies sounded even more bone chilling in reverse, but it was at least quieter. I’m not sure if that was a good thing, however.

There was a soft, repeated groaning we could now make out. Guttural and pained, it whined over and over, some long, some short and rapid, like somebody was panting in pure agony, their voice cracking through with each gasp for life. At first I thought it was the creature itself, but the more I listened to it, the more human it began to sound. A chill shot through me.

“*Eelp… oh odd… eeas…*” It’s odd whines haunted the air.

Like I said, I’d been watching the other me this entire time, and if she had been doubting things before, she certainly wasn’t now. I could almost feel her horror from across the space. I could hear her choppy breath slipping past the fingers clamped to her mouth.

Maybe it was more horrific because we finally realized that its sounds weren’t just random noises. They were words.

“*Help… oh God, please…”*

The winding continued on, duetted by the poor victims' wails, and though I wanted to help, I knew that I couldn’t. I didn’t even know what was happening to them or what the creature that had them was doing. For all I knew, it could just be another trick. So, holding myself, I sat in silence, just waiting for it to leave.

My heart skipped a beat when I heard heavy steps slipping across the pavement outside, and the winding got just a little bit louder. It was getting closer. I could see the second Hensley snap her head to me in fear, but then a loud buzzing filled the air. It made my teeth rattle and the floor beneath me begin to vibrate, then the both of us jumped as a loud screech shattered the air.

The creature’s strange sounds cut abruptly, the notes of its backward drone falling into pure and utter chaos. It sounded like a scratched record filled with mic feedback as it fell down the stairs to the road, then ran off down the street.

The other me and I stared at each other, waiting to see what happened next. The music eventually just continued its reset before resuming once again, blasting the streets as it roamed.

It never came back to us, luckily.

Still, the creature remained up top for over a day, neither me or my clone daring to move. Her especially. She was frozen solid as a statue until the noise on the shelf began to fade back down into the abyss, and even after, she still remained that way for a couple hours. I just let her.

It wasn’t until I reached for my pack to retrieve a bag of chips that she finally spoke. It was weak and hoarse, “What’s going on here?”

I sighed deeply, eying her in the dark. At this point, I don’t think I thought she was a threat still, but I wanted to be careful. “You hungry?” I asked her. I figured the least I could do, monster or not, was spare a bag of Cheetos.

It took a moment to answer, “A little, yeah.”

I slid the bag across the floor, and after eyeing it for a few moments, she snatched it up fast and tore into it ravenously. Clearly her response had been an understatement. After nearly a minute of scarfing them down, she offered an almost embarrassed, “Thank you.”

As she continued eating, I looked toward a window and cleared my throat, “Don’t mention it. And… I don’t know. The answer to your question I mean. You said that you remember reaching this town then blacking out, but things don’t get much clearer after that part.”

Hensley shook her head, “What do you mean? Why don’t I remember anything?”

I took a pause to think on my wording. Unsure of how to explain something so wild, I simply said, “Cause I don’t think you existed until a few days ago.”

That struck silence into her. I didn’t break it, letting her have all the time she needed to process. When she was done, all she had was, “What… do you mean by that?”

I took a deep breath and sat up, sliding from under the desk. Sitting atop it instead, I spoke, “Let me just start from the beginning.”

Over the next hour, I filled her in on every detail that had happened to me since arriving in this god-forsaken town. She never once interrupted or even stirred. She just watched me intently. I almost thought about giving her my phone and letting her just read my updates since I’ve never been the greatest talker, but still didn’t trust her enough to lend my only source of light.

I had no clue if she was even processing anything I was saying. Hearing it out loud from start to finish, it did sound pretty absurd.

She took a long time to decide what to ask about first. I guess the nature of her very existence was the best place.

“So… I’m just like… a clone then?”

I pursed my lips and shrugged, “I’m not sure. That’s the only way I can rationalize it.”

“But… I have all of my—I mean, *our* memories. Like, vividly; how can I just be fake?”

I could hear her getting quickly flustered, so I tried to simmer it down, “Well, you aren’t fake, clearly. You’re here, you just… are another me, I guess.”

“Okay but why? Why am I another you? What about this place would cause that to happen? And if I came from—Oh God,” she cut herself off in disgust before carrying on, “If I came from that thing that, um… came out of you… then what does *that* imply? Am I going to just turn back into meat at some point? Am I a monster waiting to burst?”

I heard her breathing pick up, and I went to try and calm her once again, but she snapped her head up to face me and spoke before I could.

“H-How do I even know I can trust you? This could all be some sick, twisted experiment or something. Somebody could have made those noises outside easily—I didn’t actually see anything.”

I couldn’t help but snicker at that theory, “Yeah, and then they were able to find a person who looks identical to you?”

“I don’t know that for sure,” she said, “I only got a glimpse of you.”

Pulling my phone back out, I turned the light on and shined it on my face, allowing her to see. In the dim afterglow of the beam, I could make out her expression; pure disbelief.

“This has to be a bad dream,” she muttered.

“I’ve been telling myself that for two weeks now,” I said.

It was a little funny that the script had suddenly switched on us. Based on her reactions, I mostly trusted at the very least that this girl wasn’t hostile, but now she was starting to distrust me. Trying to remedy that, I spoke again.

“Why don’t you ask me a question only you would know.”

She perked up a bit at that, then dashed her eyes to the floor in thought. “What was our first cat's name?” She questioned.

“Rusty. He was fluffy and orange. Dad always joked that he matched our hair,” I said near instantly. I could see a bit of shock from her, like she hadn’t expected that to actually work. “Throw me another.”

“Where did we go to school in elementary?”

“Millbrook,” I said, “They had to transfer us for our 3^(rd) grade year because the building was full of asbestos.”

“Holy crap…” other Hensley gasped, “You really are me…”

I was impressed by her too, but to be fair, her questions were vague enough for her to simply play along like those were memories she shared.

“My turn,” I started, thinking deep for a complicated one, “Where did Mom and Dad take us for our 7^(th) birthday?”

The other me took a moment before answering, and for a second, I thought I had her. I’d picked that memory for a reason, and if she was me, she should know the answer right away. When I saw her body stiffen and straighten upright, however, I knew she must have locked the day away in her mind, and it all hit her at once.

“Zane’s Jammin’ Jungle.” She said with a forlorn snicker, “That arcade on the edge of town back home. It was probably more than they could afford to book a party room at the time, but…”

“They wanted to make that birthday a good one,” I finished her sentence, my eyes falling to the floor.

At that, we both fell into silence. I slouched back against the desk in disbelief, and the other me finally crawled out from under hers to do the same.

“What do we even do about this?” She asked, “Is you, um, ‘making me’ important?”

“I don’t know,” I shrugged, “No offense, but it doesn’t exactly help our situation. Now there’s just two people trapped here instead of one.”

“Well, at least now we got two minds to go at it with,” she offered with a smile.

“Is… that how it works?” I asked with a chuckle, “We technically think the same.”

“Maybe, but our perspectives might be different.” She shrugged. Furrowing her brow, she continued, “You seem awfully calm about all of this.”

I shook my head and ran a palm through my hair, “Oh, believe me, I’m freaking out inside. But after the last dozen days of wild shit happening, I think I've lost the energy to show it.”

Other Hensley chuckled, then after a beat, she nodded at me and asked, “So, what should I go by?”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, it’s gonna get real confusing calling each other Hensley back and forth, and technically, you had the name first.”

“I mean, we can still both go by Hensley,” I told her, “We’re the only people here.”

She shrugged, “Well, if you’re writing these down in messages, it’d make it easier to differentiate between us.”

I leaned back on my palms then bit my lip staring at her. She did have a point, “We could just do Hensley and Hen. That’s our nickname outside, anyway.”

Hen thought for a moment, then shook her head and pouted to herself, “Nah, Hen is what Trevor and Dad calls us. It’s just going to make me more homesick.”

“Well, what do you want to be called? It’s technically *your* name.”

It was a while before the other me responded. She looked at the floor, then out to the window. To the darkness outside. Finally, with a slight chuckle, she spoke, her voice in a daydream.

“How about Hope?”

My throat tightened immediately, and a tingle shot up my spine.

She noticed me not responding and finally broke from her trance, turning to make eye contact, “I-If that’s okay with you. I know that it might be too—”

“No,” I told her, shaking my head fervently, “No, Hope is good.”

Before I turned my flashlight off to save battery, I saw Hope’s eyes fill with joy for the first time, and a small smile grew across her lips. I still knew nothing about her. She still could be some sort of monster waiting to be unleashed. But for now, her choosing that name out of anything else…

I think I can trust her.

“It’ll at least be nice to have some company around here I’ll bet,” she told me, “I can’t imagine being alone in this place as long as you have.”

“Yeah,” I nodded with a faint smile, “It’ll be nice. The only person I’ve had to talk to so far is myself. Although, I guess that hasn’t changed.”

I let things mellow out and focused on getting Hope settled in before getting back to work. After all, according to the note, we’re on a life-or-death timer right now. We’re going to head back up to the radio room to try and learn more about this place, and also hopefully get more signal like I mentioned in my last post. I just wanted to update you again all in case something happens with Hope.

Things just keep getting more strange around here, and I’m wondering if I’m ever going to find some answers to balance it out.

Hopefully talk to you all again soon.
