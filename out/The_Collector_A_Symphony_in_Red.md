Hello, r/nosleep.

I doubt many of you will understand my confessions, but amidst the darkness of your sleepless nights, perhaps my story will resonate with some twisted corner of your psyche. You see, I am what polite society would call a "serial killer." But that label is so crass, so devoid of the artistic flair that characterizes my work. I prefer to think of myself as a collector. Each life I take is a unique addition to my ever-growing gallery of red.

It began as a child. Most peculiarities do, don't they? While others saw insects as pests, I saw them as tiny lives, begging to be part of something greater. I would collect them, observe their minute agonies, and arrange their expired bodies into patterns and shapes—each one a small masterpiece of death. As I grew, so did my desires. The insects no longer satisfied. I needed more complexity, more emotion. I needed human hues.

My first was a woman, vibrant and flush with life. I watched her for weeks, learning her routines, her habits, her fears. The night I chose was crisp, with a whisper of winter carried on the wind. I remember every detail—the way her door creaked as I entered her home, the soft gasp of surprise followed by a crescendo of screams that I quickly silenced. Her eyes, wide with terror, saw me truly. I was her last sight, a curator at the threshold of creation.

In her blood, I found my medium, and in her death, my canvas. I arranged the scene meticulously, a tableau vivant of still life. When the authorities found her, they saw only brutality and chaos. They couldn't appreciate the composition, the careful choice of color, the deliberate positioning. But I saw the beauty in it. And I knew I had to create again.

Each piece in my collection is chosen for their potential to contribute to my gallery. A man in the park, his loneliness emanating like a somber blue; a young girl, her laughter a bright yellow that turned to a deep, sorrowful maroon under my hands. I remember them all, not by their names, but by the colors they brought to my palette.

As I refined my art, I also mastered the dance of evasion. The authorities are persistent, I'll give them that. But they look for a monster, a creature of mindless malice. They haven't considered that they are dealing with an artist. This is, perhaps, why they'll never catch me. My acts are not random violence but careful selections, my scenes not the senseless arrangement of a madman but the precise strokes of a connoisseur.

You might wonder why I am sharing this with you now. Why, after years of silent exhibitions, do I expose my inner workings to the anonymous eyes of the internet? Am I not afraid of being caught? To that, I say: every artist wants their work to be seen, understood, maybe even appreciated. Fear is a color I use, not one I obey.

Tonight, as you lay in bed, perhaps struggling to banish the images of my story from your mind, consider this: art is all around you, in the pulsing of your heart, in the rush of your blood. You are a living, breathing piece of potential art. What color do you think your life would bleed? Would it be a furious scarlet, a deep, mournful purple, or perhaps a bright splash of hopeful orange?

I am still creating, still collecting. And though you may now look over your shoulder a little more often, ask yourself—are you merely existing, or are you contributing to the greater canvas of this world?

Goodnight, r/nosleep. May your dreams be vivid and colorful.
