If I would’ve just let them eat me out my best friend would still be alive. I never could’ve imagined humans could participate in such disgusting actions.  
  
“Jordan you gotta see this new tribe that they just discovered in the Amazon,” said Ricky, my best friend at the time, “Apparently a group of explorers that confronted them were held hostage and eaten alive bro,” He continued.   
  
“Dude it’s probably just some rumor, and even if it’s true we aren’t ever going to meet them.” I stated. I didn’t care much for news or stories like that because it doesn’t affect my life in any way so there’s no reason for me to care.   
  
Fast forward a couple years, Ricky and I were on summer break from college and we had planned a trip to the Amazon. At the time we completely forgot about the story of the cannibalistic tribe that lived there and we were lured to the forest by its sheer beauty and the fact that we were pretty big outdoorsy guys. But as soon as I stepped foot on the plane, something felt wrong. I felt goosebumps start to rise and a chill went up my spine. I couldn’t put my finger on what at the time so I just ignored it thinking that it didn’t really mean anything.  
  
We didn’t exactly like the idea of just staying in a hotel and viewing the touristy spots, we were more hardcore than that. So we planned out a route on the river with an old wooden canoe that we would go on and stop by every couple miles to explore the forest and see what new animals or crazy things would happen. Basically just let our fate lie in mother nature’s hands.  
  
The idea sounds insane looking back on it, but at the time Ricky and I were so committed to this that we ignored nearly every possible risk that would come with adventure and did it anyway.   
  
We met up with an old townsman who gave us one of his old boats that he was going to throw away, but there was something off with the man. When we were loading up the boat in our rental trailer, he gave us a warning, “Do not look at them, Do not talk to them, NEVER approach them.” We had no idea what he was talking about and just assumed he had a few screws loose and just ignored his warnings. We thanked him, paid him, then we were on our way.   
  
“Ricky, you think what the old dude said meant anything?” I asked on our drive over to the river.   
  
“Come on dude, he looked crazy, there’s no way you really believed anything that he’s saying.” He replied.  
  
“Yeah, I guess you’re right, it’s just that when he said I had a feeling that he was telling the truth for some reason.” When the old man warned us I had that same feeling I had when I first stepped foot onto the plane, the same shiver ran through me and I could feel the goosebumps rise again despite the extremely hot and humid environment of the Amazon.   
  
“Nothing to worry about bro, trust me.” He reassured me.  
  
When we made it to the river, we set up the boat in the water, loaded all our backpacking gear on, and Ricky called over a man that we had met at the airport earlier to come take the trailer back to the town.  
  
The beginning of the trip was awesome, we saw hundreds of animals that I didn’t even know existed, we told some crazy stories to each other and explored the dense and extremely humid forest, collecting cool flowers and insects to examine back home. Around 10 miles down the river, I noticed a shadow flash past the corner of my eye, followed by the sound of leaves rustling and a twig snapping.   
  
“Did you hear that? I could’ve sworn I just saw something move over there.” I told Ricky,   
  
“Nah I didn’t hear anything, was probably just a monkey or something anyways, nothing to worry about,” Ricky assured me. The shadow had seemed far too tall to be a monkey, or any animal in the Amazon for that matter.   
  
Another couple of miles of silence went past, then we were greeted with a disturbing surprise. In the river we saw limbs of what seemed like humans, there were a few arms, a foot, some fingers, and a whole leg. I started to gag and was about to vomit when I noticed it. I looked over at Ricky and his face was expressionless with his eyes wide open in shock.   
  
“What the hell happened here?” I said,  
  
“I think we should head back and set up camp now, we’ve done enough exploring for the day.”   
“No kidding.”  
  
Then out of nowhere we saw an arrow fly right over our heads, inches away from giving me a brand new haircut. Startled, I frantically looked around, but saw nothing. We did hear some monkey calls though. They sounded realistic, but there was something off about them, it was almost as if a human was making them. At this point we were freaking the hell out frantically trying to figure out the fastest way to make it back. Our initial plan was to go as far down as possible on the river for a day, then set up camp, and hike our way back up in the morning. But after what we witnessed, we weren’t so sure if going on land was a very good idea, but we had no other options, there was no way in hell we were going to sit in the open for much longer.   
  
We steered our boat over to the coast and got off, and as soon as we stepped onto the soil, the monkey calls came back, this time they seemed a lot closer and louder. Ricky and I made sure to be as quiet as possible and we made sure to stay hidden as we hiked back up, hoping not to disturb whatever it was that’s out there.   
  
“Ricky, you remember telling me about that tribe that lived in the Amazon that would eat any outsider that would confront them?”  
  
“Oh god, I completely forgot about that. You think that it’s them?”  
  
“You saw the body parts yourself. We gotta get out of here bro.”   
  
We kept on going for a few hundred feet in complete silence, then SNAP. I had accidently stepped on a twig. The monkey calls introduced themselves again, and I could hear them approaching us. Ricky just looked at me and screamed “RUN!” and we sprinted as hard as we could, but we weren’t fast enough. I heard Ricky scream again and when I looked back at him I saw an arrow had impaled him right through his leg. I ran back to help him but he just told me to forget about him and save myself. I couldn’t do that so I put him on my back and tried to continue as far as I could, but I looked back and I could see around a dozen dark skinned people wearing nothing else but face paint, various piercings, and a few small leaves covering their genital areas. I pushed myself as far as I could but I wasn’t fast enough, they eventually caught up to us and grabbed hold of Ricky and threw him onto a boat that had been following them the whole time. I tried to introduce myself as peacefully as possible, but it only seemed to anger them even further. They aggressively launched me on the boat with Ricky speaking some type of foreign language making sounds I didn’t even know was possible for humans to produce.   
  
They took us back to their camp where we were introduced to what seemed like nearly 300 tribesmen. The camp was extremely disturbing, they had a bunch of these tall wooden poles all stained with blood with unknown signs engraved onto them, along with a bunch of campfires with massive pots on top of them all boiling with a rancid stench coming from each one of them. All of the tribesmen stared directly into our souls. I even noticed one of the tribesmen drooling while he looked at us. The men that had captured us led us directly to what seemed like the biggest tent in the camp.  
  
“Jordan, I just wanted to thank you for being with me throughout all of this bro, no matter what they do to us, I’m grateful you were here with me through it.” Ricky said somberly.  
  
“Me too man.” I felt my eyes burning up and tears starting to form as the shock started to pass off and I started to understand the sheer gravity of the situation that we were in. They tied us up to one of the blood stained poles next to the giant tent, and as I was standing there, tied up, my life started to flash before my eyes. I saw my girlfriend Madison and the future we could’ve had, getting married, having children, living life, and being happy.   
  
Then a massive man came out of the tent, he had to have been at least 6 foot 5 and over 250 pounds. His face was covered in red paint, he had dozens of piercings across his torso and his face, along with razor sharp animalistic yellow teeth. He ordered a few of the tribesmen to carry us onto a stage where nearly the entire camp had gathered in front of all, chanting something that I couldn’t understand. I could see dozens of them salivating and smiling and cheering. The giant man who seemed to be the leader approached us on the stage with a massive razor sharp serrated stone knife. He looked over to his people, and made a sort of speech with various monkey calls then as soon as he was finished he brought the blade over to Ricky’s neck. Ricky looked over to me with somber eyes and tears falling down his face.  
  
“I love you br-” SLASH. He was dead. A waterfall of blood came out of the slit in his throat and his head slowly fell down as his life poured out of his eyes. The crowd started cheering louder and hollering in excitement. They untied him then took him over to a table that had been set up on stage and what they did next I couldn’t bear myself to look at. They dissected him for every one of his parts and skinned everything off of him. It was horrifying and at that moment I understood that there was no God, all my consistent prayers for years meant nothing. There was no one to save me, nothing could change the outcome of this. As he finished dissecting the remains of Ricky, the man turned back at me and as he approached me, then out of nowhere a miracle occurred.   
  
The old man that had warned us about the tribe had shown up out of nowhere with a small army of other fellow residents of the town all geared up with guns and grenades. The leader and the tribesmen were startled and they diverted their attention to the old man and his army. A full out war broke out with bullets and arrows flying over my head, blood splattering everywhere and screams of pain from all directions. In the midst of this I managed to get a hand free and grab the knife that the tribe leader dropped and I was able to cut the ties and free myself. I made a break for the boat and hid inside the helm of the boat and started to pray. My faith in god was restored and I started praying and gave thanks to the lord for everything and for the fact I was alive. Once the brawl had died out, the old man came back looking beaten to hell, along with the men that he had come with. I managed to make it back home to my girlfriend safely thanks to the mysterious old man that we had met, but I still had lost my best friend. This was a weight that I was forced to endure for the rest of my life. Everytime I recall the trip, I think of Ricky’s helpless face streaming with tears looking straight into my eyes. Thank you for everything Ricky, rest easy buddy.
