Hi, my name is Mel. I’m nineteen years old, and I need help.

Let me start off by saying, I live in [redacted] city. It’s a very busy, bustling city. I’m talking people everywhere, the scent of coffee and donuts and an assortment of breakfast foods drifting on the wind every morning. The city is alive with people, vehicles, smells and sounds. 

I’m a simple university student. I’d say what I’m studying, but it doesn’t impact what I’m trying to say. What I’m trying to ask, to share, to understand. 

I have never dreamed. All my life, I have never remembered a dream when I woke up. Until a couple weeks ago. I fell asleep, and I dreamt. Now this might sound like your typical nightmare, but I promise it’s not. 

In my dream, I was in this institute. A mental hospital if you will. But it was… well, kind of like the reverse of your typical psychiatric or mental hospital. By that I mean the patients seemed stable, while the doctors are insane. 

The walls are splashed here in there in blood and bits of gore. The floors are disgusting, caked in dust, dirt, the tiles barely visible through all the filth. The halls and corridors spiral, the entire building a maze. A maze of gore, filth, and destruction. I can tell it is a mental patient because there are many desecrated signs reading “Welcome to Duskridge, Your best choice of Mental Institution”. 

As I wander through the halls, there are chairs. Those padded chairs with the straps on them, some with patients hooked up to them. Doctors standing over them with unnatural grins, cutting them open then and there. Their grins are wide and wrong… too wide, and almost like they were trying to imitate humans.

I started to panic, my heart palpitating. I started to run, through several halls and past more of these doctors torturing patients. I try so many doors, hoping one will open. One finally does, and I’m met with the sight of the first patient I come across, sitting in their bed, a straight jacket restraining them. 

They look at me, with a haunted, yet knowing expression. I watch as they lick their dry lips before rasping, “You shouldn’t be here. You need to hide. You need to wake up.”

“What?!” I ask incredulously, even more frightened. “Hide from what? Where even is here?”

“Hide from the doctors. They’re the crazy ones. Don’t let them get their hands on you. If they manage to operate on you, you’ll be stuck here. Forever.”

My heart pounding in my chest, sweat beading on my forehead, I start to ask another question, but then I see the door knob start to turn. I dive under the cot, hoping it’s low enough to the ground to hide me. I press my hands over my mouth, trying not to make a sound. 

As the door slowly creaks open, I see the long, blood-spattered, once white coat that every doctor I’ve seen has been wearing. 

“I know you’re in here!” The doctor sing songs in this high, almost alien sounding voice. It doesn’t quite sound human. 

Then, a hand grips my ankle and drags me out from under the cot with force. I scream, the sound blood-curdling. And the next thing I know, I’m waking up in my bed, a cold sweat covering my body and making my sheets stick to my body. I look at the time, only 2:00 in the morning. And I’m too frazzled to fall back asleep. 

I try to convince myself that I’m okay, that it’s just a nightmare. But I’ve never dreamt before in my nineteen years of life. The dream sticks with me until the morning light washes through the room, when it manages to slip my mind again. 

But the next night, I have the same dream. Walls covered with blood, floors disgusting. Crazy doctors. And me inevitably waking in cold sweat. But this time, when I check the time, it’s 2:10 in the morning.

This pattern continues. But every night, I get closer to getting stuck in this dream world. Each night, the dream lasts longer. The dream is starting to affect the real world, and vice versa. 

A week ago, in the nightmare-scape, I got caught. By multiple doctors. They strapped me to one of the chairs in the hall. Scalpels in their hands. They started to carve into me, making me cry out. Then I woke up. But… the cuts? They were still on my skin. When I stepped out of my bedroom, there was a huge blood splatter on my hallway wall. Grime on the floor… 

I need help. I’m scared that every time I sleep, this is the time I won’t wake up. My phone has started journeying with me into this horrific place. But it’s utterly useless aside from the notes app. I don’t know what to do. Has anyone else gone through this, “woken up” in this… unexplainable landscape, night after night, staying longer each time? Does anyone know how I can stop it? 

Please, help me! I’m scared it will be too late soon. One of the chairs is starting to take shape in my home.
