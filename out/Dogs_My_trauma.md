This happened pre covid, when I was in 10th grade . I was having my coaching at 4pm, the place wasn't that far away like 5-10 mins from my home so I always left home only 10 mins before the time. There were many routes for my coaching place from my home, usually I always took the normal route but then one day I was late and hence thought for a couple of seconds while eating & getting ready to take the shortest route which I have taken only once, this right here was my biggest mistake. I shouldn't have done that. It's been 8 years and I still regret it.

This shortest route was between some abandoned houses & a couple of powerhouses (don't know if they worked or not) & some cars. I had friends at that coaching but our different timings didn't allow us to go together. So I went alone everyday and that day as well. 

After passing the abandoned houses, the powerhouses/powerplants (I don't know what they're called) come in my view, I had these weird feeling something like which we get at extreme danger like intuition that I shouldn't go ahead, but me being the naive kid late for his coaching started walking ignoring every wrong sign I felt at that moment. (how I wish I used reddit at that time to know/grow myself out of that naive stage but yeah no point in thinking about that now)

Just when I was halfway into the area of powerplants, I heard some loud growls, which I swear sounded so loud at that moment that I still don't know how to explain. After hearing that growl, the dumb me stood there frozen, turned to my right to check the source of that sound and yes I saw an unknown local dog which looked scary af. Now look & try to understand I did roam my area almost everyday during those days and knew many dogs, especially the dangerous ones but this was a total unknown one, maybe it slept near that area only? After watching that dog, thankfully I wasn't frozen and immidiately ran from it just to get away, and that right there was another big mistake which I still regret. That wasn't the end just the start of the traumatic day.

I was naturally above average but below the true athletic ones in my peers, I had the confidence that I could get away from that dog but the reality was different, just a few seconds and I could hear 5 more dogs excluding that 1st one going after me while barking. I didn't had the guts nor the time & opportunity to turn back & see how many dogs were chasing after me. I don't know how but at that moment I made a split second decision to get out of these small lanes (my current location is small lanes just after the powerplants) and go towards the main road which is populated to shout for help and so I did. 

Me knowing the lanes of my area helped me and just a couple of more lanes & I could see the main populated roads, but as I was running at my fastest speed I couldn't turn right at the moment and hence I missed the right lane and went into a wrong lane & stop right their, because ahead of me I see 2 more dogs barking at me. (idk if they're the same dogs from the before or some new ones because that wasn't imp. At that very moment) I could feel chills when I heard the dogs frim before running while barking trying to find me, and the 2 dogs ahead of me barking at me as well, Now I did the most sanest thing I could at that moment, I shouted for help but like I said, that wasn't my day and so no one responded. I saw some stones and tried to intimidate the 2 dogs ahead of me just to get rid of them which could help me get away from the 5-6 dogs as well which were chasing after me from the start. But that didn't go well as, they didn't back down but rather they started crying/howling?

 And jumped after me, now I only had a backpack which has some pens, and books with me and a couple of stones. I threw the stones at both of them and in that panic I could hit one of them made it whimper and stop in its tracks but the other one jumped at me and I was down on the ground. The dog was trying its best to bite me and I was restraining it somehow with my bare hands maybe adrenalin? , the situation was still dire even thou one of dog had backed down because I could still hear many dogs barking a few lanes behind my location not yo mention the dog which I was restraining. I used one of my hand to push the dog as back as much as I could, during that free moment, I took out a all of my pens & kept them in my pocket, then threw the bag filled with books at that dog to end this.

As expected this dog backed away as well, without looking back ignoring the barking which sounded way too close to me, I tried to run but.. before I could, I felt too much burden on my left leg, I saw a dog biting my leg, I couldn't feel the pain at that moment because I had turned back and saw 8 dogs behind me barking at me... Trust me you wouldn't want to face that situation. I used whatever strength I had in my right hand to throw the dog (which was biting) away, I still hadn't felt the pain because of the fear. 3 dogs ran towards me & jumped at me, I used the gate of an abandoned building at my right to open at the right moment to hit them, and thought of running into the abandoned building (it was 4 floors tall) but I was injured & most importantly tired after so much physical & mental stress so I didn't, more like I couldn't. Rest of the 5 dogs came as well, I moved inside the building to narrow the space as much as i could, that helped me a bit, I used whatever I could at that moment to hit them to back them, rock, cans, empty box but nothing worked and finally I slammed my phone at them during that heated moment, Then i saw some of the previous pens fall out of my pocket, I had 3 more pens remaining with me, I used those 3 pens to stab at those 5 dogs & stopped them from approaching me again, but those mfs didn't stop. 

Then I finally felt pain in my legs due to the bites on both of my legs and my hands felt weak as well, I used my remaining strength to get out of that area but those mfs again approached me while growling, Luckily I had moved some distance and move to a diff location & found a steel pipe, I picked it and banged it on the ground to scare them away and they backed off, while I sighed in relief, a dog from that group suddenly turned back & still jumped at my face, in sheer panic I swung the steel pipe right at that dog's face and boom that dog went limp on the ground... That loud sound of the steel pipe and the dog hitting the ground finally ended that incident. Those dogs ran away & I too hurriedly ran away to get away from this. Before running away I clearly saw that dog not breathing...  I don't know if that dog survived or not but personally from what I know there wasn't any news about an injured dog at that time... 

I didn't tell this whole incident to anyone, just told my parents & my coaching teacher that I was bitten by A dog. The teacher took it to the face value, my parents didn't, because they could see the injuries but I insisted & didn't elaborate much. And I still haven't told them this. I live in India, I have already shifted away from the place where this happened but I still feel the fear & guilt everytime I see a dog.
