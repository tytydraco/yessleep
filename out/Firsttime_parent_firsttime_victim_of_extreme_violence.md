Our toddler was asleep and looking peaceful at 8:00 p. m., so my wife and I seized the chance and tiptoed excitedly to the bedroom.

We were asleep by 8:02. It was *wonderful*. You know those naps that seem to transform the world, delivering you back into the land of the waking without immediate comprehension of where, when, or who you are? It was one of those naps, whisking me away like a cloud made of marshmallow crème and sunshine. The air tasted like honey afterwards, and the blankets wrapped me in a caress that spoke of emotional support and frozen time.

I woke up nineteen minutes and thirteen seconds later to Ella screaming across the house. I tried to move my arms, but they seemed to be pumping cement instead of blood. I was very, very tired.

“Mmmmfph,” I groaned to Kimmy. 

“One of us is getting up to check on her, and the other will be squirting milk out their nipples to keep our child alive,” she mumbled. “Make your choice.”

I wanted to say something witty, but my brain was running at about eleven percent. A surprise fart slipped between my cheeks and got trapped in the sheets; since my mind could conjure no strong verbal response, I decided to let the gas speak for me by letting it fester beneath the blanket as I got up and stumbled out the door.

I flipped on the hall light and stumbled into Ella’s room with one eye open and the other one closed, trying to ignore the way her shrieks hit my eardrums. I love my daughter heart and soul, but I’m not particularly attached to her vocal cords. It would actually be kind of okay if she waited until age twelve before walking or talking. 

A bolt of adrenaline punched me in the gut as I realized that *the window is open and someone is standing in the shadows.*

Every mental cylinder fired asynchronously at once as I raced to get between Ella and the shadow, barely flinching when my shin barked against the wooden cabinet and tore thin flesh away from my tibia.

I slammed to a halt, arms held inexplicably wide, as I stood between the man and my child. 

Ella stopped crying. 

The shadow took one step toward me. Another. 

Another. 

I couldn’t afford to turn around and grab my daughter; the half-second of turning my back would be more than enough time for the shadow to strike. I held my breath and raised my fists. 

The shadow rose above the ground, floating to the ceiling like a balloon. A woman’s face floated into the light cast from the hallway. She hovered seven feet above me.

It made no goddamn sense. 

Then her mouth opened wide, wide, wider than a dinner plate. A triplet of prehensile tongues spilled over a double layer of crooked fangs.

I knew that I was going to die. There was no tunnel or life flashing before my eyes, just an awareness that she would be soon be mashing my intestines like stringy sausage on those horrid teeth. My only hope was that I’d buy enough time for Kimmy to get Ella out to safety.

It might sound like I was brave, but I pissed my pants, so there you have it. It wasn’t a light sprinkling, either  - I hosed myself down past the knees. 

“KIMMY, WE NEED YOU!” I screamed while looking for a place to punch the betongued spectacle. 

The pounding of bare feet across the hall told me that she instantly understood my fear. She whipped the door open and froze.

“Oh.”

“What the hell do you mean, ‘oh’? Take Ella and RUN!”

One of its tongues extended ten feet from the mouth and licked my wrist. It was sandpapery and very slimy, like a cat puking KY Jelly.

“Step back, Russ,” Kimmy answered, her voice sad.

“What? No! This thing has – teeth and shit! Get out of here!”

The thing dropped its mouth open another six inches, its eyes full of hate. 

Kimmy padded quickly up behind me and tapped the back of my skull. 

The soft, cottony dream sensation returned as I rolled to the floor, paralyzed. 

“Ella,” she cooed, turning to the crib, “you’re old enough. It’s time.” 

Then Kimmy stepped back.

I tried to scream at her, but I couldn’t even stop my bladder from making a bigger mess, so I was pretty much useless. 

The monster leaned over Ella’s crib, green drool hanging from its fangs. I wanted to turn away, to close my eyes, *anything*, but I was powerless and could only watch.

“Ella,” Kimmy scolded our two-year-old.

The thing pounced.

Ella raised a tiny arm and grabbed the fangs.

The monster froze in place.

Then my toddler broke the teeth out of its head, causing the beast to scream as it collapsed across the crib.

Ella dropped the shattered teeth on the ground.

“NO,” Kimmy retorted in her best ‘mom’ voice. Ella looked up at her timidly as Kimmy pointed to the incapacitated, whimpering beast. “Finish.” 

Ella turned around, contemplated the hideous monster, then tapped her fist against its skull. The head crumpled like paper mache, and its body went limp. 

“Good girl,” Kimmy sighed, crossing the room to scoop Ella into her arms.

“All done?” Ella asked.

“Yes, sweet girl,” my wife responded, kissing her on the head. 

Then she bent down and ran her fingers through my hair. “I’m so sorry you had to find out like this, Russ, and I’m so sorry that you’ll never understand everything.” Her breath hitched. “But I’m sure you realize that Ella and I have to leave now, even if you disagree with it.” She kissed my forehead. 

“They’re coming.”

She whisked Ella out the room, calling to me once more as she left. “You’ll regain movement in a few minutes, hon. I promise that you’ll be okay.”

Then she [disappeared from sight](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).
