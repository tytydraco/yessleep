I wanted to leave right then. Just stand up, walk out into the cold, and drive off. Let the place rot. Let Miller come back and deal with it. Let the next idiot sign the logs and chase ghosts and hear laughter from floors that didn’t exist.

But I didn’t leave.

Because I was still gullible enough to think that quitting like that — mid-shift, no notice — would go on some sort of *permanent record*. Like there was a shadowy security guard blacklist floating around in an office somewhere downtown, and my name would be circled in red ink with a little note: *WALKED OFF POST. UNRELIABLE.*

I laugh about it now. I really do. How young and dumb I was. Like I thought there was someone watching me through all those empty cameras, grading my performance like a teacher with a clipboard.

So instead, I did what I always did when I didn’t know what else to do: I waited for morning.

I sat in the same metal chair. Held my revolver loosely in my lap. Let the space heater warm my shins. Ate a stale pack of crackers from the vending machine and washed it down with cold coffee I’d brewed hours ago and forgot about.

At one point I tried turning on the monitor to rewind the tape — just to see if that pale figure I saw out the window had shown up on the feeds. But the VCR tray made a sick grinding sound when I pressed eject, and the screen just flashed black and blue with static.

Of course.

Eventually, the sky started to lighten. Just a little. That pale, washed-out gray you only see through frost-fogged glass and fluorescent glare. I watched the frost creeping down the edges of the window like it was trying to get inside.

That’s when I remembered the newspapers.

So I grabbed them from the front step — cold and damp in its plastic sleeve — and made my way across the lot, hands stuffed deep in my coat pockets, boots crunching like bone under snow.

The admin building looked the same as always. Still smelled like lemon floor wax and burnt coffee. Still had that buzz in the ceiling tiles like something just shorted out and never got fixed.

The same woman was there, sitting behind her metal desk, coat still buttoned up like she didn’t trust the heat. She didn’t smile when I walked in. Didn’t greet me.

She just looked at me.

Long and hard.

And then said, “You look like you saw something.”

I didn’t answer right away.

Just handed her the paper.

Then I said, “Yeah. I did.”

She didn’t ask what.

She just took the papers, put them on the metal table, and went back to her filing cabinet like it was any other Monday.

Like she already knew.

I stood there for a minute. Hoping, maybe, she’d tell me something else. Something that would help me sleep.

She didn’t.

So I turned, left the building, and walked back to the Nova.

The windshield was frosted over. I scraped it clean with cassette tape case, then sat in the driver’s seat with the engine running and my breath fogging up the glass.

I didn’t even go home first.

I headed straight to the security company office, running on fumes and jumbled nerves.

The office was over on Denison Avenue, tucked between a shuttered hardware store and a check-cashing place with bars on the windows. The front door buzzed when I pulled it open, jangling a bell that sounded like it had a smoker’s cough. The lobby was a sad little square of brown linoleum and mismatched waiting chairs. On the wall, a corkboard full of faded notices and mugshot-quality ID photos of other guards, some with “DO NOT REHIRE” stamped across their faces in red.

I walked up to the front desk and said, “I need to talk to whoever’s in charge of the Cleveland Developmental Center account.”

The girl behind the desk looked like she wanted to be anywhere else — bleached hair, pink bubble jacket, long purple nails tapping at a rotary phone like she was sending Morse code. She pointed toward the back.

“You want Jerry.”

I knocked once on a metal door with peeling paint, and a voice barked, “Yeah, yeah — come in.”

Jerry was the kind of guy who always looked halfway between a sandwich and a nap. Big gut, short-sleeved uniform shirt even in winter, mustard stain on his tie. He sat behind a battered desk with a mountain of manila folders stacked on one side and a crusty Mr. Coffee machine on the other.

He didn’t look up right away.

“You’re the new guy on CDC?” he said. “Millers replacement?”

“Not anymore,” I said, shutting the door behind me. “I’m done.”

That made him look up.

“Done?”

“Done,” I repeated. “The place is haunted. I’m not going back.”

There was a pause.

Then he laughed.

It wasn’t mean, exactly. Just that kind of tired, middle-aged laugh guys do when someone says something ridiculous but believes it.

“Haunted, huh,” he said, leaning back in his chair with a creak. “What, chairs flying around? Little green ghouls jumping out of closets?”

“No, I’m serious,” I said. “I saw—” I stopped. “Heard things. Saw someone. And the guard before me — he pulled a gun on whatever it was. Fired real bullets. That was real.”

Jerry snorted and rolled his eyes. “Yeah, That guy was marijuanaed up 24/7. You know what I mean? Probably shot at his own shadow after eating too many hash brownies. Can’t take a word he said seriously.”

“He shot because of what he saw,” I said. “Now I get it.”

Jerry gave a lazy shrug. “The only thing haunting CDC is rust and mildew.”

“I’m not going back. Transfer me to a different account. Anything. I’ll do parking lots, warehouses, midnight shift at a used car lot, I don’t care.”

He sighed and ran a hand down his face.

“Look,” he said. “We’re stretched thin right now. We’ve got a new guy coming in today — some twenty-year-old fresh outta security school, needs training wheels. You go in for four hours, just four, and walk him through the basics. Show him how to check the logs, keep the radio on, don’t shoot at shadows.”

“No.”

“We’ll pay you for the full eight.”

I paused.

He saw it.

Jerry leaned forward, arms on the desk, his tone a little softer now. “It’ll look good on your record. You do us this favor, we move you to something easier by the weekend. Day shift, even. No more spooky ghosts.”

That word again: record.

The one I was dumb enough to believe mattered.

I stared at the coffee stain on his desk. Then at the window behind him, where the glass was fogged and smeared with fingerprints.

Finally, I said, “Just four hours.”

He smiled like a man who’d just sold a used car.

“Attaboy. And hey — no ghost talk, alright? Don’t spook him.”

I didn’t answer.

I just stood up, walked back through the lobby, past the girl with the purple nails, and stepped out into the cold morning air.

The sun was high and ugly by the time I pulled into the alley behind my apartment. That raw, anemic light that makes everything feel off — too bright to sleep, too cold to be alive. A thin dusting of snow had melted into slush on the sidewalk, leaving behind chalky rings of salt and frozen cigarette butts. Someone had dumped a busted chair next to the dumpster, its legs cracked like broken bones, stuffing leaking out the sides like cotton guts.

I parked the Nova and sat there for a second.

The engine gave a low knock, even after I turned it off — one of those metal settling sounds that always makes you think something’s going to fall apart. I trudged up the back stairs, boots heavy with road salt, and unlocked the door to my apartment. Same smell as always: reheated pizza grease, burnt dust from the heater, and the faint chemical scent of lemon-scented bug spray.

I kicked off my boots, peeled off my coat, and collapsed face-first onto the mattress without bothering to close the curtains. The thin winter sunlight spilled across the floor in grayish ribbons, painting long shadows from the cracked blinds across the room.

I was out in minutes.

When I finally woke up, the light in the room had changed — lower now, more amber than gray. Dusk was coming on, slow and heavy. The kind that creeps instead of falls, dragging its heels like it doesn’t want to leave you alone just yet.

I sat up, throat dry, feeling like I’d swallowed gravel. My shirt was stuck to my back with cold sweat. I checked the clock on the microwave.

**9:37 PM.**

Just enough time to splash water on my face, slap on deodorant, and throw on the same wrinkled uniform from the night before.

I hesitated when I looked in the mirror.

My reflection looked like a guy halfway through a nervous breakdown. Bloodshot eyes, pale skin, jaw set too tight. I rubbed my face hard with a towel and said out loud, “Four hours.”

That’s it.

Just four hours.

The drive back was automatic.

Same route. Same potholes. Same oldies station on the radio playing at low volume like it was trying not to wake anyone up.

By the time I turned onto the access road near the asylum, the streetlights were flickering to life — slow, reluctant. A few of them were already out. A soft fog was starting to roll in from the trees near the west lot. Not thick, but enough to blur the outlines of the distant buildings. The cottages looked like cardboard cutouts in the haze.

The security office was lit.

I parked in the same spot as always. Under the flickering lot light that buzzed like a dying bug zapper.

I took a minute before getting out. Sat with my hands on the wheel, headlights off, watching my breath curl in the air. I thought about turning the key, backing out, and never coming back.

But I’d said I’d do it. Four hours.

So I got out, slammed the door behind me harder than I needed to, and trudged across the frozen gravel toward the station. My boots crunched over a patch of black ice, and I slipped a little — caught myself on the doorframe.

Inside, it was colder than outside.

The heater hadn’t been turned on since I left. The room smelled stale again — like mildew and warm plastic. That weird chemical-laced lemon scent had faded into something sour and forgotten.

I flicked on the lights.

The bulbs hummed to life overhead, casting everything in that bleak yellow wash. The monitors were black. I didn’t turn them on. Not yet. I didn’t want to look at the asylum. Not unless I had to.

I pulled the space heater close and stood over it, rubbing my hands together like a man trying to feel his own skin again. The heater rattled and clunked like it was waking up from a nightmare.

I looked at the wall clock. 10:41.

Nineteen minutes until the new guy was supposed to show.

I spent the next few minutes tidying the place up like I was expecting company — straightened the chair, wiped some coffee rings off the desk with my sleeve, shoved the crumpled vending machine wrappers into the trash.

When I was done, I stood near the window, staring out through the wire-reinforced glass at the main drive.

The sky had gone completely dark now. A few faint stars twinkled behind a thin layer of clouds, barely visible over the skeletal trees lining the rear fence. The wind had picked up, whistling through the gaps in the window seals like the building itself was breathing in pain.

Then I saw headlights.

Far off, bouncing up the long gravel drive.

A boxy little car — maybe a Plymouth Horizon or some off-brand Dodge — sputtering up the incline like it wasn’t used to the cold.

He was here.

The new guy.

The car rattled its way up the long gravel path like it didn’t want to be there either.

It was a beat-up silver Dodge Omni with one red door and a rear bumper held on by twine. The headlights blinked wildly as it hit a pothole near the first cottage, and the engine coughed like a smoker taking his morning hit.

I stayed at the window, watching as it rolled to a stop two spots down from the Nova.

The door creaked open.

The kid who stepped out couldn’t have been more than twenty — twenty-one, tops. Thin, bony guy in a stiff brown leather jacket two sizes too big and a knit beanie that had probably never been washed. His face was clean-shaven, but it didn’t do much to make him look older. Eyes too wide, mouth half open like he was chewing gum or nervously biting the inside of his cheek.

He looked up at the asylum.

Paused.

Then quickly looked away.

Smart.

I opened the office door before he had to knock.

“You the new guy?” I asked.

“Yeah,” he said, voice high and fast. “I’m—uh—Danny. From Denison Security Associates.”

I stepped aside and let him in. He moved like he wasn’t sure whether to shake my hand or salute or just stand still and wait for orders.

I didn’t offer a handshake. Just motioned him toward the empty chair by the heater.

He sat, blinking at the humming space heater like it was a fireplace in a cabin during a blizzard.

“You been on a site before?” I asked.

He shook his head. “Just graduated. This is my first security job.”

I nodded, not saying what I was thinking: *You poor bastard.*

I walked him through the basic routine: check the boiler logs in the cottages, do a full outer perimeter walk at the start of shift, another at the end. Don’t touch the files in the admin building.

And most of all: don’t go into the tunnels.

“Are there tunnels?” he asked.

“Don’t worry about it,” I said. “They’re sealed.”

I lied.

His eyes flicked to the monitors behind me.

“You guys use cameras here?”

I gave a little shrug. “Sometimes.”

“Do they work?”

“Most of the time. Not worth relying on.”

He nodded like that made sense, even though it didn’t.

He was nervous, but not scared. Not yet. That would come later.

“Break room’s through that door,” I said, pointing to the dented steel door in the back corner. “Same key as the outer buildings. There’s an old coffee pot in there. Creamer’s expired. Sugar’s just ants and dreams.”

He gave a short, breathy laugh. “Good, I need caffeine.”

“Go ahead,” I said. “I’ll show you the camera feed when you get back.”

He stood, patting his coat pockets like he thought he needed to bring something with him.

“It’s just straight through?” he asked.

“Yeah. Opens up into a little kitchenette. Nothing fancy.”

He gave a half-smile and headed for the break room.

I watched him go.

As he disappeared around the corner, I turned to the monitors behind me.

Still dark.

Still waiting.

I sat there with my hand hovering over the VCR’s power switch, listening to the clink of the break room doorknob and the squeal of the hinges as Danny stepped inside.

I waited a minute.

Then I flicked the monitors on.

The screen hissed and popped as the grainy black-and-white feeds blinked into place one by one. Static first, then slow vertical rolls. The switcher cycled through angles: main gate, admin hallway, East stairwell, admin building lobby, break room and the asylum
