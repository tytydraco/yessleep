I lost someone whom I loved and cherished while I was away from home. The night that I found out, I was awakened by tapping that i had never heard before. Mind you, ive slept in this bed for coming up on 3 months plus Im in no way a light sleeper, and I am literally a stiff log. I barely move in my sleep. 

When I tried to fall back asleep the tapping was just so annoying that I couldnt ignore it. It sounded like it was directly above my head, hitting the wall. I literally got up in the pitch black, moved the bed off the wall and tried unsuccessfully to go back to sleep. Finally I decided to go outside and look for the tapping on the outer wall. When I grabbed my phone to use it as a flashlight, I started to get messages that the person had passed away. It seemed like as soon as I read the messages, the tapping stopped. 

At first I thought maybe I accidentally turned on my phones ringer and that it was my phone going off, but I never have my phones ringer on because I hate to be disturbed, even then I checked. It was off. It was like (tap tap tap) then it would stop for a moment then again in threes. And it wasnt at all loud. I am mildly autistic, therefore I’m very particular about the noise around me and how I position things in my life. Since this event, I’ve been waking up and returning home with my bears moved. I notice these things because, as I’ve stated, I am very particular with my placement of things. This has been happening since their passing. Am I looking into it too much or is that really odd to you as well? I have gone to various family members with my concerns but they all chalk it up to my autistic tendencies. 

Which if anyone knows them best, it’s going to be myself. My bedroom door is locked each time I leave so I don’t see anyone going into my room and moving them while I’m gone. Its just a bit scary and confusing because while this person was a huge part of my life and my main supporter, I could never express to them how much they meant to me because thats just how our relationship was and I feel like maybe I just might be forcing myself to hold on because I wish so badly that I had gotten the chance. 

(For context, I am in college and have three roommates, all who I barely speak to so it’s obviously not one of them breaking into my locked room on the other side of the apartment. I also have a bear that the person gave me, which I keep in a chair at the front of the room in the left corner, most days when I come back, the chair is facing a different way, towards the corner as if it were on time out or something. Which I find a bit funny but creepy, since I dont face it that way, ever.) (also im new to reddit so idk how this really works yet!)
