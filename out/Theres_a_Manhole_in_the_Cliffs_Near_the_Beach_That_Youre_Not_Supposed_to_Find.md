I didn’t fall into it.

That’s the part that keeps me up.

I noticed it.

Most people walk the cliffs here staring at the water, the horizon, their phones. I walk looking down. Patterns. Seams. Places where things don’t line up the way they should.

I’m autistic. High-functioning, if you like labels that make other people comfortable. What it really means is my brain catches on snags most people glide past. Repeating shapes. Wrong spacing. The way a sound echoes when it shouldn’t.

The manhole was wrong.

It sat flush with the rock, not rusted, not weathered, not bolted. Perfectly round. Perfectly clean. No markings. No city seal. Just… there. Like it had always been there and was waiting for someone who knew how to look sideways at the world.

I stood over it for a long time.

People passed me. Joggers. Dude on a skateboard. A couple arguing. Nobody slowed down. Nobody even glanced at it. When I asked a man if he could see it, he laughed and told me to stop messing with him.

When I touched it, the metal was warm.

Not sun-warm. Body-warm.

The cover slid aside without a sound. 

It was surprisingly light. It felt like pulling a heavy looking door open way too fast.

No ladder inside. No darkness. Just light — clinical, white, endless — and a low mechanical hum that vibrated in my teeth. I should’ve left. Every instinct said wrong. Very wrong. But curiosity is louder when your brain doesn’t prioritize fear correctly.

So, I climbed down.

The tunnel didn’t go down really. It went through. Like gravity was politely optional.

I landed on a platform overlooking something I still don’t have words for.

Imagine an airport baggage system. Conveyor belts stretching farther than you can see. Chutes branching off at sharp angles. Platforms staffed by… people. Or things just shaped like people, wearing masks and costumes that are actually pretty on point. Clean. Pale. Efficient.

Above it all, a sign pulsed softly:

REINCARNATION INTAKE

I laughed. I do that when I’m overwhelmed. A short, sharp bark that gets me noticed instantly.

One of them looked up.

“Processing error,” it said, and walked over.

Up close, it smelled like antiseptic and ozone. No hair. No pores. Like a medical diagram wearing skin.

“You’re early,” it said.

I told it I wasn’t dead.

Like, really tried to drive that point home.

It tilted its head. “Statistically unlikely. But not impossible.”

That’s when I noticed the labels on the chutes.

HIGH ADAPTABILITY
DESIRABLE NEUROTYPE
GENETIC STABILITY
LOW RESOURCE BURDEN

And then, farther down, barely lit:

REJECT

I watched a man stumble off a belt. Old. Confused. Shaking hands. A tremor he couldn’t control. He tried to speak.

A panel opened beneath him.

He didn’t fall.

He was discarded. Like trash down a chute that didn’t echo.

I asked what happened to him.

The thing didn’t hesitate. “Defective vessel. Nonviable traits.”

My chest tightened. “You mean… disabled.”

It smiled mechanically. Not kindly.

“We optimize continuity,” it said. “Consciousness is recycled. Only traits that improve survivability are permitted forward.”

“And the rest?”

It gestured to the dark chute.

“Waste.”

I felt sick. Angry. Numb in that buzzing way where my thoughts start stacking instead of flowing.

“What about autism?” I asked.

It paused. Just a fraction too long.

“Historically inefficient. Poor social cohesion. Increased care cost.”

I laughed again. Louder. “You’re wrong.”

It studied me. “Explain.”

“Every major system failure humans ever avoided,” I said, “someone like me noticed the crack. The wrong pattern. The thing everyone else ignored.”

Behind it, a belt jammed. Alarms flickered. The hum stuttered.

The thing turned slowly.

For the first time, I saw fear.

“You’re not supposed to be here,” it said.

“I know,” I replied. “That’s kind of my thing.”

The system began to destabilize. Belts stopped. Souls — if that’s what they were — piled up, confused, scared, aware.

A woman grabbed my arm. She had Down syndrome. Her grip was strong. Solid. Real.

“Don’t let them throw us away,” she said.

I ran. 

My terrified brain let my legs take over.

I don’t remember how I found the way back. The tunnel resisted me, like trying to push through thick syrup. Something screamed behind me — not angry, but panicked.

I climbed out onto the cliffs as the manhole snapped shut behind me.

The ocean was still there. The sky. Joggers. Life.

I sat there shaking until sunset.

I thought that was the end. 

But of course it wasn’t.

Since that day, people don’t look at me the same. Some avoid me. Some stare too long. And sometimes, when I pass someone struggling — a limp, a stutter, a twitch — they lock eyes with me like they know.

Like they’ve been processed before.

Last night, I heard metal scraping outside my apartment.

When I looked out my window, the streetlight flickered… and for just a second, I saw a perfectly round shadow pinned beside my rusted sedan.

I think the system noticed me back.

And I don’t think it likes defects that can climb back out.
