Hi again Michael here. I was the one who wrote [“My reason for never EVER thrift shopping again!!”](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yp5s60/my_reason_for_never_ever_thrift_shopping_again/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Well since then some weird things around campus have been happening. It started with Mia, the girl in the trash bag, then the creepy stalker and now when I’m in the basement I feel like I’m being watched. It’s been weird I won’t lie to you but a couple days ago it…got worse. 

It all started when me and my house mates were cleaning the top floor bathroom. It was a normal thing to do and I thought nothing of it. As I reached the back shower though I noticed the smell. It wasn’t bad but it smelled damp and woodsy, like the forest after a fresh rain. I searched for the source and there it was, a small yellow mushroom, peaking up from the gap between the pulled away floor and the shower step tile. It was so small and I wondered how it had even appeared there. Was there some fungus under the floor or had someone accidentally bought in a spore? Whatever the reason I carefully plucked the mushroom from its home and tossed it in to the trash bag. I thought that was it…I was wrong. 

The next day I went to the bathroom and there was the smell again. That deep woodsy damp smell. I looked and there it was again, another mushroom. This time though…there was two. I chuckled and knelt down “Persistent little fuckers aren’t you?” I asked gently plucking them from their home. I carried them outside and threw them in the trash. This little routine of finding mushrooms plucking them and throwing them away continued for a couple more days but then it got worse.

The smell started off gentle almost calming but then a more unpleasant aroma started. It started off small, mixing with the damp woodsy smell and soon it became overpowering. It smelled like mold, like rot. It was horrible. I mean we tried everything to stop or mask the smell. But, it didn’t help and as the smell got worse the mold began to spread. The floor where the mushroom started turned black and mushy with mold. It spread from the floor to the sides of the shower and it grew. We sprayed watered down bleach, ammonia and even heavy cleaning products, we scrubbed it from head to toe NOTHING WORKED!!! Finally we all sat down and decided that it was time to call the school and explain the situation. 

The school called the mold removal service who came in and told us we needed to vacate the premise so that they could check the rest of the house. Luckily for us it was the beginning of winter break so most of us were going to be leaving anyway. A few days after vacation started my friend called a remote emergency house meeting. We all hopped on the call expecting it to be a quick thing…we were wrong.

Apparently the removal service had to rip up all the flooring in the bathroom and what they found…makes me shiver to this day. The entire bare floor was covered in thick dark reddish mold and fungus. And the smell, apparently it was horrible! But the worst part was what caused the mold…dirty blood soaked clothes. The blood caused the floor to rot and without any oxygen the fungus started. Apparently each piece of clothing was covered in dark mold. Now I remember why that smell in the bathroom was so familiar. It smelled just like them just like…the storage room. And then I remember with sickening dread what else was in that bag with Mia: small yellow mushrooms.
