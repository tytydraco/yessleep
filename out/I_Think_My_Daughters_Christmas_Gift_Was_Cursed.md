I almost overlooked it, that last present beneath the tree. It was a lumpy badly-wrapped thing that looked like it had never seen the inside of a box, and had been stuffed into a corner, almost like it had been hidden there. I had my doubts about the strange package, but my seven-year-old daughter Eliza was never one to pass up an unopened gift.

“It’s for me!” she shouted, and sure enough, “ELIZA” was printed in big black letters on the side. I had a sinking feeling as she tore into the plain brown paper: the gift wasn’t mine, and my wife’s wrapping was picture perfect, nothing like the ugly paper that my daughter was pulling apart. I breathed a sigh of relief when I realized that the gift was only a baby doll–one of those incredibly lifelike ones that can be fed and changed like a real infant. Eliza had been begging for one all year, and when I saw the eerily realistic doll in my daughter’s arms, I figured that my wife had finally found one that we could afford. 

The doll had light brown skin and curly golden hair. Its eyes were closed as though it were sleeping, and was dressed in one of those flower-pattern outfits that were popular in the 1970’s. Peering over my daughter’s shoulder, I noticed some strange burn marks on its upper chest. When I unbuttoned the cloth, I saw that they were letters: ashen-black letters that looked like they’d been branded into the doll’s skin. “LUCY,” they read. If that was the doll’s name, it was a sick way of showing it. Some instinct made me want to rip the doll out of my daughter’s hands, but she pulled away.

“Lucy doesn’t want to go with you!” she insisted. “Lucy is mine.” I frowned. My daughter wasn’t usually so possessive of her toys, but I could see why she was so entranced by “Lucy.” If I didn’t know better, I would have sworn it was a real infant. Eliza let out a shriek of joy and ran up to her room, cradling her new doll to her chest. The living room was a disaster area of wrapping and tissue paper, but looking at it, my wife and I couldn’t help but laugh. Eliza had gotten us up before dawn to watch for Santa, and now the two of us finally had a chance to drink some coffee and rest.

Eliza spent all day with Lucy: cradling her in her arms, twirling her around, talking to her. She even took Lucy with her when she went for her evening bath, but reacted with a scream when I tried to put the doll into the tub at her side.

“Lucy doesn’t like running water,” she warned me. When I asked Eliza how she knew, my daughter shrugged: “Duh! She told me.” 

As I put my pajamas on that night, I told my wife that she’d really outdone herself this year:

“Eliza loves that doll you got her! Where on earth did you find one that we could actually afford?!”

My wife gave me an odd look: 

“I didn’t. I thought that you did!” 

Silence. I think that my heart actually stopped beating for a second before I sprang out of bed and sprinted to my daughter’s room. To my horror, she wasn’t in her bed: instead, the doll was beneath her sheets with its head on my daughter’s pillow, looking so real that it seemed it might sit up and open its eyes at any moment. Ignoring it, my wife and I raced through the house shouting our daughter’s name.

We found her walking down the stairs in the dark. My wife grabbed Eliza’s shoulders and shook her:

“Honey, what is it? Have you been sleepwalking?!” 

My daughter shook her head. 

“No. Lucy wanted me to get something from the kitchen.”

I groaned. I felt a headache coming on. Eliza had always been an imaginative child with a tendency to get obsessed with things: the year before, it had been horses; before that, mermaids. If Lucy was her next big thing, my wife and I were in for a long winter. 

“What did Lucy want you to get, honey?” My daughter frowned at the question. 

“I’m not supposed to say…” she whispered.

“It’s okay, honey.” My wife hugged her. “You can tell mommy and daddy anything, come on…”

While my wife soothed Eliza, I snuck upstairs to inspect the doll more closely. Touching it, I shuddered: its skin felt so real…

“Get away from Lucy, daddy.” I spun around like a thief caught in the act. Eliza was standing in the doorway, pointing an accusatory finger at me. “No one can touch her but me!” 

“That’s enough!” I groaned. “If you keep this up, mommy and I are going to take Lucy away.”

“NO!” Eliza ran to the doll and flung herself on top of it, sobbing. In no time at all, she was fast asleep. My wife and I exchanged a glance before covering her with a blanket and dragging ourselves back to bed. It was past two AM, and I had to work in the morning. 

I woke up a few hours later to a hushed conversation outside the bedroom door:

“Are you sure?” Eliza was whispering. “But…they’re my parents…”

There was a long silence…like someone or something was responding to her. I crept to the door and pressed my ear to the wood:

“Just a little cut? That’s it? Then they’ll be fine?” Eliza asked for reassurance. The door creaked open. Something shimmered in the glow of the nightlight:

A kitchen knife in my daughter’s hand. In the other, cradled to her chest, was Lucy. Eliza tiptoed into our bedroom, the blade held high above her head–

My daughter shrieked as I tackled her. Lucy and the knife skidded across the floor.

“What are you doing?!” my wife sat up in bed, still half-asleep. 

“Lucy has to eat!” Eliza yelled. A burst of pain shot up my arm as she bit down on my wrist and squirmed out of my grasp. “And if you won’t feed her, then I will!” 

Before I could stop her, my daughter scrambled to Lucy, cut her own hand on the knife blade, and squeezed droplets of warm blood into the doll’s mouth. Its eyes snapped open, as bright and white as two full moons in our dim bedroom. 

No. This couldn’t be happening, I told myself. Dolls don’t move on their own. Dolls don’t drink blood! As I tore Eliza away from Lucy, I would have sworn that its fleshy plastic lips had just curled into a smile. 

Then it was over. The doll’s eyes closed…and my daughter fell unconscious in my arms. I pressed my hand to her forehead: it was so hot it almost burned. No matter what I tried, she was unresponsive, her breathing shallow, her hands and legs as limp…as a doll’s. While I dialed emergency services, my wife stormed out of the house and flung the awful doll into the trash. Just having it out of the house felt like a heavy weight had been lifted from my chest, and by the time the paramedics arrived, my daughter was sitting up in bed and even talking a bit. Her fever was still dangerously high, but it seemed to have broken. They warned us to keep an eye on her, but told us not to worry too much: she was showing signs of improvement, they said.

By morning, my daughter seemed to be perfectly healthy. My wife and I attributed her behavior the night before to delusions brought on by fever, but I think the truth was that we just wanted to put the whole unsettling experience behind us. As for my daughter, she didn’t seem to mind that her favorite doll was gone; in fact, she didn’t even ask about it. For me, that was the most disturbing aspect of the whole thing: it was like the hellish night before had never happened at all.

We didn’t have much time for wonder. My daughter was more cheerful and energetic than ever during those next few weeks: playing in the snow, dancing in her room to her grandfather’s old records, and drinking cup after cup of hot cocoa. My wife and I were so thrilled about her rapid recovery that we didn’t ask many questions, although looking back, perhaps we should have.

My daughter’s tastes changed drastically after that night. Instead of the frilly pink skirts and light-up tennis shoes that we were used to, she suddenly preferred tie-dye, bandanas, and sandals. Her vocabulary seemed to have doubled overnight, but some of the slang sounded odd coming out of my daughter’s mouth. Since when had she said “far out” instead of “cool” and “freaky” instead of “weird”?!

More troubling, however, were some of the other changes I noticed. My daughter’s teachers had always praised her for being kind and helpful, but almost as soon as school was back in session I received a troubling phone call. Apparently, my sweet seven-year-old girl had pushed an older boy down the stairs. When I confronted her about it, she only shrugged:

“I didn’t like his face.” 

It was those words, so coldly and cruelly delivered, that finally forced me to finally open my eyes. I couldn’t lie to myself any longer: everything was different. My daughter’s personality, her taste in fashion and music, even the way she walked and talked…it was like, ever since that night, she had become a different person. I suddenly felt a desperate need to find that doll. 

I got to the dump at closing time, but two fifty-dollar bills were enough for the watchman to leave the gate unlocked for me. 

“If you’re caught, I never met ya,” he spat, before driving away and leaving me alone among the eerie, foul smelling piles of junk. “Crazy bastard.” 

Of course, I had no idea where to start. I wandered through the post-apocalyptic mountains of trash with a single flickery flashlight, waiting for a tiny plastic hand to shoot up from the filth and grab me. It never came. Instead, I spent the night exhausting myself for nothing. I left at dawn, smelling terrible and worried about tetanus. I wasn’t looking forward to explaining where I’d been to my wife, but when I got home, the house was quiet. 

I found my daughter in her room, plucking petals off of a flower. I wondered where she’d found it…and when she’d left the house.

“Honey, have you seen your mother?” I asked.

“She’s gone,” my daughter shrugged, still tossing petals onto the rug. 

“Gone?!” I shouted. “What do you mean, gone?!”

My daughter just shrugged. It was all that I or the police got out of her, and my wife was still nowhere to be found. Waiting sleeplessly for news, I spent the next twenty-four hours scouring the dark corners of the internet for any sign of the doll or others like it. While I did, I kept the door locked. Twice during the night I noticed the handle try to turn…and heard my daughter’s bare footsteps retreating back to her bedroom. I closed the blinds, irrationally afraid that I would look up from my research to find her pale face grinning at me from the other side of the second-storey window. Finally, I found it:

An ad online for a familiar-looking doll. This time, however, its short brown hair was cut in the same style as Eliza’s; it was wearing a miniature version of the frilly pink skirt and light-up sneakers that my daughter used to love so much. I contacted the seller right away and set up a meeting for the next morning, after I dropped my daughter off at school. I tried to make conversation with her, hoping that she might drop some clue about what had happened to her mother, but my daughter spent the entire ride staring straight ahead with a knowing smirk on her face: the kind that said “I know something you don’t know…and I’m not telling.” Instead of waving goodbye, she just stared at me as I drove off, silently mouthing some words at my tail lights. Maybe it was just my imagination, but I would have sworn that they were “one down, one to go.” 

I was still troubled by what those words might mean when I arrived in the supermarket parking lot where I’d agreed to meet the doll’s new owner. So early in the morning, the place was nearly empty, but the woman I was meeting was already there waiting for me. One of her van’s windows was sealed with a black trash bag; through the grime of the other, I could see heaps of discarded toys: teddy bears missing eyes, superhero figurines without heads, and others that were so junked that I could no longer tell what they might have been originally. I suspected the overweight, unhealthily-pale woman in front of me might be a hoarder or a dumpster-diving addict, but I wasn’t there to judge: all I cared about was the cloth bundle in her hands and the haunted look in her eyes. I handed over a ten-dollar bill and unwrapped the doll.

“It’s a beautiful doll,” she was saying, in a husky smoker’s voice. “My kid was just startin’ to get a lil’ too…attached to it.”

The doll was exactly as I remembered. The oddly-lifelike skin and hair. The perfect details of the mouth and face. The eyes closed as if in sleep…and the strange black letters branded into its chest. I unbuttoned its shirt to confirm the horrible truth that, deep down, I already knew.

The name “LUCY” was gone. It had been replaced by a new one: “ELIZA.”
