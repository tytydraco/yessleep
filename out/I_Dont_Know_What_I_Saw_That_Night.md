This happened when I was in my teen years, back when I lived in an apartment complex with a huge patch of dirt behind it—probably five miles of nothing but cracked ground. No buildings, no trees, nothing. I always thought it was weird that no one had built anything there, but I never really questioned it.

It was around 6 p.m. The sun was starting to dip, but it wasn’t dark yet—just that in-between time. I was on my back patio, sweeping off the dirt patch. At first, it was faint, so quiet I almost didn’t notice it. A low electric hum, like a distant buzz, but it wasn’t from my phone, or my neighbors, or anything I could explain. It felt like it was coming from the dirt patch itself.

I thought maybe it was just me. Maybe I was imagining it. But it wasn’t. The sound got louder, sharper, until it was undeniable. Something wasn’t right.

I looked out at the dirt field, but nothing seemed out of place.

And then—it just appeared.

Not with a beam of light. No crash, no explosion—just a low, metallic hum. A saucer-shaped craft, hovering about two feet above the ground, just sitting there, no lights, no windows, no indication of anything but dull matte black.

I didn’t move.

The buzzing sound faded, and then what seemed like an invisible doorframe popped open. It was so perfectly made that at first, I didn’t notice it, like it blended into the craft itself. Then, metal stairs dropped down.

And then—something stepped out.

It was tall, black, and thin, but not fragile. Its skin had that same matte black sheen, reflecting the last bits of daylight. It had small, pure white eyes that darted all around. One second, it was looking at me, the next second, it was staring at the ground. Then it looked up at the sky, then at the neighbor’s apartment complex. It just kept looking around, like it didn’t know what to focus on.

For a moment, it just stood there, staring around. Then, without warning, it was right in front of me.

It didn’t walk. It just… appeared.

It raised the black stick and pointed it directly at my forehead.

And then—

It spoke. Not out loud, but inside my head.

“You are nothing but a passing shadow. You exist because we allow it.”

“The veil is thinning. The sky will break. The cycle must continue.”

“You will not remember this in the way you wish to.”

I felt a sharp pressure in my skull, like something was squeezing my brain, forcing the words into me. It wasn’t a voice, it was like it was pressing its thoughts into me.

And then—

I somehow woke up, lying in my bed. I didn’t know how I got there. My head was spinning. I had a very bad migraine, one that didn’t go away until the next morning.

I ran back outside to the patio. Everything was normal. There was no one. No ship. Just the same boring patch of dirt.
