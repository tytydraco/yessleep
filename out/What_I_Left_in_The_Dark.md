He arrived without an appointment. No name, no referral—just walked into my office ten minutes before closing and sat down across from me like he'd always been there. His eyes were wrong. Not in color or shape, but in recognition. He looked at me like we’d met before. Like I had done something to him.  

I asked his name. 

He smiled but didn’t answer, just tilted his head like he was waiting for me to say it. My pen wouldn’t write when I tried to fill out the intake form. The line for Patient Name stayed blank, no matter how hard I pressed. And when I glanced at the mirror behind him, only one of us was visible. 

“You don’t remember me, do you, Rob?” He asked, his chuckle sharp. 

 My hand twitched, tracing a faint scar on my thumb, my brother’s pocketknife, a blood-oath gone wrong. The memory slipped away, but the patient’s eyes held it. 

“How do you know my name?” I asked. 

“I thought I'd be hard to forget. But you’ve been avoiding me for so long.” He leaned forward, as if testing my boundaries. 

“Maybe, maybe it’s easier if you pretend I'm not real, right? Easier for both of us.” 

I took a moment, gathering my words. 

“Well, what brings you in today?” 

He paused. 

“Well, I think it’s been you who’s brought me here.” 

“I didn’t mean to come, but it seems I've been following you for a while now.” 

He looked past me, focusing on... something. 

“It’s time you finally see me, don’t you think?” 

I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck rise, a shiver I tried to ignore. 

"See you?" I echoed, trying to regain control of the situation. "I’m not sure what you’re implying. Care to clarify?" 

He didn’t answer right away. Instead, his eyes seemed to scan the room, but his focus never left mine. 

"You’ve seen me. You just haven’t been looking." His voice was low now, as if sharing a secret. "And you never wanted to." 

The silence between us stretched, the sound of the clock ticking louder than it should have been. I tried to brush off the unsettling feeling, but it crept up, sinking deeper into my skin. 

“I’m afraid I don’t understand.” My voice came out more strained than I intended, but he didn’t seem to notice. 

“No,” he said softly. "You do. You just buried it." 

There was a sudden pressure in the air, like we were both holding our breath. Waiting. Waiting for something. 

I glanced at the mirror again. This time, I didn’t just see myself; his reflection stared back at me. 

And in that moment, I knew: I had seen him before. But the memory slipped away, like water through my fingers. 

I stood up to signal the end of the session, trying to keep my composure. “Let’s meet next week,” I said, the words coming out mechanically. 

He nodded, slowly, like he understood something I didn’t. But before he stood, he leaned in slightly, his voice dropping to a near whisper. 

“You’re not sure if I’ll come back, are you?” 

I froze, hand still on the door. He had a point, but I couldn’t allow myself to acknowledge it. 

“I’ll see you next week,” I repeated, this time more firmly. 

As I walked him out, the hallway felt different. Longer. The light flickered as if struggling to keep up with my thoughts. I glanced at the clock, but I swear the minute hand had moved too quickly. 

When I turned back to my office, I saw the reflection again—the same reflection I had seen in the mirror. It wasn’t just a flicker this time. I saw myself... and him. Standing beside me. 

But when I blinked, it was gone. 

The notes from that session were a complete blur. I went over them  

again and again, yet the handwriting wasn’t quite mine. It felt as though there was more beneath the surface, something I couldn’t put my finger on. 

I picked up the pen, but it wouldn’t write. 

I blinked. There were new words on the page. The same, unnatural writing. 

“You’ll understand soon.” 

“God damn it!” I slammed the notebook shut, my heart pounding. 

The next appointment came quickly. 

“Hello again,” I said. 

“You don’t seem to be listed in our records. How long have you been seeing a therapist?” 

“I haven’t. I felt—a pull. Like I was meant to come to you.” 

“Why do you think that is?” I replied as he smirked. 

“People are capable of horrible things, Rob. You’re not special.” 

I glanced again at the mirror. This time, it wasn’t a person, but a crime. A violent, bloody crime. 

The patient tilted his head, watching me with detached amusement, while humming a song. So familiar, yet I couldn’t put my finger on it. 

“That blood on the window,” he said calmly, “it’s yours. You tried to forget, didn’t you? But some stains, they don't wash off. They linger. 

He smiled again, but this time, it was softer. Not mocking—reminiscing. 

“You called it an accident.” 

He paused. 

“But it wasn’t. That’s for sure.” 

I sat there, unmoving. After an eternity, I gathered the words for a response. 

“I don’t know who you are or what you want, but I did no such thing.” 

He smirked, then began to chuckle. 

He walked out of the room. 

An unsettling calm washed over me, but beneath it, a powerful urge took root. I had to know. Know what he meant, know why that blood was on the window. A fragmented image flashed in my mind: a dark shape, a glint of metal, a muffled sound, but it vanished before I could grasp it. I stood up, my legs feeling heavy and unfamiliar, and found myself moving towards the hallway, drawn by an invisible thread in the direction he went. I walked towards the lobby, determined to find the truth. I passed by the front desk and decided to ask them where the patient went. 

“Did a man leave just now?” 

“No, you’ve been alone for an hour, Rob.” 

\*\*\* 

The next morning, my desk had a sticky note on it. My handwriting, at least I think so. 

“Stop pretending.” 

I read that in my kitchen. When my head moved up, I was in my office. The patient was waiting, as if he knew I was going to be there. 

I sat down, my throat tight, expecting his usual smirk or cryptic words. But he just stared, silent, his eyes locked on mine. No tilt of the head, no chuckle—nothing. The clock ticked, each second stretching into a void. I cleared my throat, tried to start. 

“So,” I said, voice cracking, “why are you here today?” 

He didn’t blink. His gaze bore into me, heavy, like it was peeling back my skin. I shifted in my chair, the pen trembling in my hand. 

“What do you know about Daniel?” I pressed, desperation creeping in. 

Still nothing. The mirror behind him flickered, showing only me, then him, then me again. My reflection’s eyes weren’t mine, they were his, blue and sad, like Daniel’s. I looked away, my heart pounding. 

“Say something!” I shouted, slamming my fist on the desk. 

He leaned forward, just an inch, and the air thickened. No words, but his silence screamed louder than any accusation. I felt it, the weight of what I’d buried, pressing down, suffocating. 

“You’re not real,” I said. My voice was shaking, but I kept going. “You’re something I made up.” 

“Isn’t that the same thing?” he asked. 

I threw a chair. I don’t know why. Maybe some part of me thought that hurting him would end this for good. Instead, the chair hit the wall and fell apart like it was made of paper. 

He just stared at me. Pity in his eyes. 

“You buried me,” he said, “Deep. But you can still feel the weight, can’t you?” 

I rushed him. Fist clenched, breath ragged. I needed to hit something. 

The moment I made contact—pain. White-hot, lancing through my ribs. Like I’d punched myself. Hard. 

I fell back, gasping. He hadn’t moved. 

“You can’t hurt me,” he said softly. “You’d only be hurting yourself.” 

“What the hell are you doing to me!” I screamed. 

“You are doing this to yourself. We both know it.” 

I stood there, silent. 

After a while, I curled into my chair, heart hammering. My hands were trembling. 

“It wasn’t an accident,” I whispered. 

He stepped closer and started laughing. 

“There it is! You're finally listening!” 

Blood on the glass, a scream. A sharp glint. The flash of a wrist twisting. 

I sobbed. I don’t remember starting, but I couldn’t stop. 

The lights buzzed. When I looked again, he was gone. Only one chair in the room. Just me. 

But in the mirror, we were both still there. 

He was watching me. 

Waiting. 

I opened my notebook. The pen worked again. I didn’t remember writing the final sentence. 

“He didn’t die. I just left him in the dark long enough to forget he was screaming.” 

The notebook slipped from my hands, the words burning through me. My chest heaved, the air too thick, the room too small. The mirror stared back, but it wasn’t my office anymore. It was the kitchen, our kitchen, the one in the house where Daniel and I grew up, where we’d carved our initials into the table and swore we’d never be like Dad. 

The vision hit like a blade. I was there again, the fluorescent light buzzing, the air sour with whiskey and rage. Daniel stood across from me, his eyes wild. 

“You took it all, Rob!” He shouted, slamming his fist on the counter. “Dad’s money, the house, everything! You left me with nothing!” 

 His words cut deeper than they should’ve, unearthing years of guilt; I'd been the one who ‘made it,’ while Daniel drowned in debt and drugs. I tried to explain that dad’s will wasn’t my choice, but he laughed, bitter. 

“You’re just like him, a liar.” 

 

I didn’t know when I took the knife. It was sitting there, in the block by the sink, its handle clenched in my palm. 

“Shut up, Dan,” I growled, but he kept going, daring me. 

“What, you gonna fix me, therapist?” 

 His shove sent me flying back, and then something snapped. I lunged, the knife sinking into his chest—once, twice, blood pouring out. He gasped, stumbled, and crashed into the kitchen window, his hands clawing the glass desperately. 

“Robert...” he whispered, sliding down, his eyes locked on mine, wide with shock. 

 I froze, the knife clanging to the floor, a memory flashing: us as kids, pressing our hands to that window, dreaming of escape. 

I blinked, and the vision disappeared. I was back in my office, the mirror blank, the patient gone. But the blood, it lingered in my mind, like a wound that just won’t close. I’d covered it up, hadn’t I? Dragged Dan’s body to the basement, wrapped it in a tarp. Smashed the side window, tipped over chairs, cut my own arm to sell the story. 

An intruder. A fight. Daniel “missing.” 

Days blurred. I stopped answering calls, let appointments pile up. Colleagues left voicemails: 

“Rob, you okay?” 

But I couldn’t face them. My office became a cave, papers strewn, mirrors draped with shirts, but the window found me. In my apartment’s glass door, in the coffee shop’s storefront, in every polished surface, blood, Dan’s handprint, his face pressed against the pane, mouthing, why, Rob? The patient’s voice followed, soft, 

“You see him now, don’t you? You can’t unsee blood.” 

His sessions, if you can even call them that, grew worse. He’d sit there, his face shifting, sometimes Dan’s, sometimes mine. 

 “You took the fortune, Rob,” he’d say. “But you paid in blood. You’re next.” 

 Mirrors showed the kitchen window, Daniel’s body slumped, blood dripping upward, defying gravity. Once, I swore I heard his voice, not the patient’s, but Daniel’s, whispering through the glass:  

“You kept it all, Rob. Give it back.” 

\*\*\* 

I don’t know when I decided to end it. Maybe when I found a note in my handwriting, Free him, Rob, tucked in my coat. Maybe when the patient said,  

“You can’t live with both of us.” 

 I drove to the office at midnight, the city a maze of glass, every pane reflecting the kitchen window: blood, Daniel’s hand, his dying gasp. I climbed the stairs to the roof, my legs heavy. The door was unlocked, like it was waiting. 

The rooftop was cold, the wind sharp. Below, the city glimmered, a thousand windows staring up. Every one was the kitchen window, blood streaked; Daniel’s face pressed against it, his body falling, over and over. Some showed him alive, laughing as a kid, our hands on the glass, promising to share everything. Others showed the knife, my hand twisting, his blood spraying. The patient stood at the edge, his voice soft, almost kind. 

 “You see him everywhere, Rob. Free him.” 

I stepped to the ledge, my heart pounding. I believed it, believed my death would release him, let his spirit rest, maybe let us be brothers again.  

“I’ll make it right, Dan,” I whispered, picturing us young, free, before Dad’s shadow, before the fortune tore us apart. The patient’s eyes were Daniel’s now, blue and sad. 

“Come home, Rob,” he said. “We’re brothers again.” 

I leaned forward. The wind roared, the glass below a sea of blood and memory. The panes flickered—Daniel’s face, our childhood, the knife, the blood—then went dark. The wind stopped. For the first time in what seemed like forever, it was silent. I let go, and the world tilted as I dropped into the glass below.
