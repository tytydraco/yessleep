It was Sam who saw it first. Said he was out hunting with his dad down by the central lake. Central lake didn’t mean anything to us. You could climb a tree at any of the lakes and if you saw forest in all directions as far as the eye could see then that was good enough as centre. No matter which lake we found ourselves, the woods seemed to expand limitlessly in the distance. We never knew when,or if, we were heading home until suddenly we'd arrive at the back doorstep. Thinking back on it now feels like remembering a dream. Walking aimlessly, tripping over roots, and dilapidated rubble among a cave of unrelenting greenery my memory jumps instantly to blinding sun and the sound of stuttering sprinklers.

 

Sam’s Dad led him through the woods, a rifle slung around his shoulder and a torch in hand. Wasn’t unlike any other hunting trip Sam had told us about. They’d walk for a couple hours, with little to no conversation, they’d spot a deer and Sam would be passed the torch. Was told to “keep it steady” and with trembling hands Sam would blind the deer with its beam long enough for his dad to take aim and fire. We’d laugh saying how stupid they were that they’d just freeze like that in the torchlight and let themselves be killed. Now I realise it was a pre-programmed response. A biological instinct that causes you to freeze and buffer in the face of something completely alien. So alien that the threat of death could not yet be processed.

 

The deer dropped to the ground like a “ragdoll! Got him good too, must have hit a main artery or something. Dad said it looked young since its antlers hadn’t really come in yet. Anyway, Dad had bent down to pick up the torch and started to tie up the deer so we could take it home and that’s when I saw it. There was a light in the distance.”

 

“So there was another hunter in the woods.”

 

Sam rolled his eyes “Come on man, do you think I’d be telling you this if it was? It was only for a few seconds but as my dad was working I saw a blueish light in the distance move along the tree line and disappear. It wasn’t elongated like a torchlight; it was kind of like a ball. Yeah, a ball of light that didn’t jostle like it was being held by someone. It was smooth. Gliding almost and then…. gone.”

 

Sam was clearly more impressed with the story then the rest of us as we all swiftly moved on to better conversation.

 

“No seriously guys I’m not lying!”

 

“We didn’t say you were, it’s just not interesting.” Tom said laughing.

Sam pouted and slunk back down in his chair. Tom turned to me smirking and I shook my head. Fin cleared his throat awkwardly and raised his hand slightly.

 

“I saw something like that too.”

 

“Fin, dude, you never told me you went hunting too”

 

“I don’t.”

 

Sam squinted confused.

 

“I err ran away from home a few nights ago.”

 

Fin’s parents as I’ve come to realise now, weren’t his biological parents. Fin was fostered. The parents he found himself with were clearly of the latter variety of foster care. Parents who saw childcare more as a wage then a responsibility. We used to call Fin “Peach” on the account of his bruises and would tease him that we weren’t even being that rough when we played. After what happened I never saw Fin again until around college huddled round a pipe on his side with a man wiping sick from his mouth.

 

“I left through the back door and ran into the woods. Thought I’d be caught more easily if I took the streets. I can’t remember how long I ran for; I just remember the light.”

 

His legs pumping like pistons he took off through the woods jumping over fallen trees and smashing through branches. Said he didn’t have a direction in mind and was only thinking “away”. He told us about the squelching under his boots and how he had a wind-up torch that he’d have to crank to see anything. Told us about hooting owls and yipping foxes, and what he could only describe as “the sound someone makes attempting to whistle”. Exhausted he collapsed to his hands and knees his numbed fingers finding warmth in the void before him. He reached for his torch cranking the handle watching the light sputter to life and glisten in the lifeless eyes of the engorged stag that lay beneath him.

 

“God the smell. It was so bloated, like a giant water balloon burst at the seams and leaking. There was something shiny in its abdomen where my hands had been… it was full of teeth. Then that sound came back again louder and fading in the distance. When I looked up, I saw them. Those lights moving further and further away along the floor and then just disappearing.”

I’ve only been in the woods once at night besides the incident. The four of us went camping with the scouts late November when we were nine. The leader brought us all under the canopy and told us to turn off our torches, but he kept his on. Positioned it beneath his chin and grinned calling us into a huddle. He told us the story of “The Tailor”. Using my shirt as a prop he rubbed the fabric between his fingers. “The tailor was a fine man. Best tailor in town! In fact, I’d dare say some of your uniforms are a piece of his craft. That is to say if they survived the fire.” He continued the story describing to us how the tailor was talented, and how he was driven “mad by the desire to hide his disfigurement.” The story continued and ended with the tailor sewing together human skin and some freak accident that caused a fire.

 

The leader ended the night with a big announcement.  “Now before we go to bed tonight, I have to warn you that a gorilla escaped from the zoo this morning. Authorities have warned us that the gorilla is still on the loose and that any sighting should be promptly reported. I trust that you boys will do is proud. Oh and if you do see the gorilla- “The tent was shaken furiously with a series of grunts causing us all to scream in terror. The scouts closer to the zip fled out into the dark, their torches the only thing resembling them as being one of us as their body was engulfed by the night. The four of us took chase after the gorilla in a battle cry waving our torches around like police batons, the other scouts shouldering our platoon.  We were disappointed to discover the gorilla was just scout leader Blue in a suit. 3 of the scouts didn’t make it back to camp.

 

A search party was called that lasted the entire week. Some of the scouts said they saw lights heading towards the right of the tent instead of the left, after the gorilla. “They must be really fast! I was a person behind them and as soon as I made it out, they were just a small light in the distance. It disappeared before I could reach them, so I doubled back towards camp.” Only one of the scouts was found. Frostbite in his hands and feet he said something about a “tree whispering”.

 

Tom told us he wasn’t allowed back at the scouts. “I forgot my sleeping bag, so I went and saw one of the leaders and we shared. I can’t believe my dad would ban me just for forgetting something like that.” We all stopped going after Tom left.

 

Tom looked up at Fin after he finished telling his story.

 

“Yeah, right!”

 

“I’m not saying you have to believe me.”

 

“I don’t know Tom; Fin doesn’t really lie about these things.” I said patting Fin on the shoulder.

 

“These things? You mean things like a deer full of teeth? Come on Jake! You must not be hearing him right.”

 

“Leave off will ya.”

 

“I think Peach isn’t tender enough to be hurt by a few words. I mean seriously we’ve been in those woods for our entire lives, and we’ve never seen anything like that.”

 

“I saw a two-headed rabbit hunting with my dad.”

 

“Yeah Sam, and you’ve also seen a UFO, and Bigfoot, and Moth man.”

 

“Okay, okay, I admit it. I didn’t see Bigfoot, but I did see a weird light in the woods. Like seriously X-files type Stuff.”

 

“Guys calm down. Theres only one way we can settle this. We’ll go to the woods tonight and find those lights.” I said, palms on the table like a businessman closing a deal.

 

“My parents won’t let me.” Tom mumbled.

 

“Mine don’t care.” Fin remarked.

 

“Mine neither.” Sam said grinning.

 

“Have they actually stopped you leaving the house before?”

 

“No.”

 

“So what’s stopping you?”

 

“What if they get mad?”

 

“Easier to ask for forgiveness then it is for permission.” With that Tom nodded and knocked me on the shoulder.

 

“Alright, let’s do it! Peach we’ll be in the woods behind your house by 9PM. We’ll click our torches on and off 3 times, so you know it’s us.”

 

Me and Tom reached the woods behind Fin’s at 8:50PM. We didn’t talk much. Tom stood there shuffling his feet and stroking his arms nervously. He should have stayed him. The woods at night changed entirely. It felt like we had stepped onto an alien planet, one void of light and stinking of damp and musk. The air was humid like that of a rain forest though the ground was dry. I could feel it under my boot crumbling beneath my weight, I didn’t need a light to confirm it. The insistent drone of the motorway lingered among the ambience reminding us we were still at home. Jake came up from behind startling us with a snapping branch and a clinking shoulder.

 

“What’s that?”

 

“It’s my dad’s gun.”

 

“Really? What do we need that for?”

 

“You haven’t been in these woods like I have Jake. Theres monsters everywhere.”

 

“Most of them ones you’ve dreamt.” Tom said smirking, clearly at ease now.

 

By 9PM we all took out our torches and gave Fin the signal, who upon the first light sprinted out before we could even finish. From Fin’s we set off walking straight thinking that as long as we didn’t make any turns, we could easily find our way home by simply turning around. Logic is equally alien to this place as light.

 

Several hours of walking amounted to nothing but brief arguments and reminiscent stories, but largely silence. We’d whisper rather than talk. Whenever I’d speak, I would be overcome with a powerful sensation as if my words were trespassing in bounded air. Even the owls soundlessly mumbled, their pupils shrank against the torch, but their beaks were clearly in conversation. The drone of the motorway had long since passed and light pollution a distant memory against a star filled sky. This felt central to me. Fin caught me by the shoulder and motioned with his hand to listen. It sounded like someone trying to whistle. A half shrieking sound, air in movement but staggering. Erratic without direction.

 

We rounded a boulder coming to the bank of a lake. Glowing beneath the moonlight its glistening ripples crashed against the earth licking our shoes. Sam bounded up to me pointing to where he had seen the light and pointed out a patch of dried blood from him and his dad identifying this as the lake from his story. We rounded the lake towards the head taking note of some water striders that danced aimlessly towards the gaping mouth of a frog or fish. Aimless in themselves but an aim for larger things. The soft lull of crashing waves ceased in sound and if one of us did talk neither of us could say if we heard it. The sound grew in intensity as we stood our ground facing the abyssal forest, then suddenly… Light. A flash of blue from a den in the earth and just as quickly as it appeared, it dove and disappeared the sound abruptly dying.

 

Fin smiled raising his eyebrows at Tom whose jaw was agape. Fin mouthed, maybe said, “Told you so” and Tom crossed his arms in a pout. A gut-wrenching shriek shattered the air. A horrendous orchestra of deep bellowing devastation in crescendo with snorts of intense excitement. Sapping and popping the dark silhouette filled and elongated in a disjointed fashion before promptly standing and leaping over us as we stood in complete terror, the gun already in Sam’s trembling hands. It was a deer. It took off sprinting in the moonlight for a brief moment before disappearing again.

 

“What the hell was that?!” Tom panted clutching at his chest.

 

“Jesus Christ! I’ve never seen anything like it.” Sam said the rifle still in his hands rattling.

 

Fin cranked up his torch jogging towards where he saw the light disappear.

 

“Guys come check this out!”

 

Reaching Fin atop the rim we gazed down into the rot filled pit. Deer. Empty husks flattened like a doormat and laid atop one another in a gross macabre. Sam prodded one of them with the rifle watching a perfect hole take shape in the hollow flesh which failed to bounce back.

 

“The light came from in there.” Fin said motioning to the tunnel in the dirt mound.

 

“I can’t fit in there”. Tom was the biggest of us. Broad and built like a football player.

 

“Of course you can!” Fin shone the light through the tunnel making out a dip where it opened into a chamber. “As long as you can make it through this you can stand up just fine and we can continue on.”

 

Tom hunched his shoulders shrinking into himself. “Okay I believe you. We all saw the light; now can we just get out of here?!”

 

“No way man! Theres something here you won’t find back there. I mean come on, when have you ever seen anything like this at school, or home, or at the supermarket? We have an opportunity to really see something!”

 

“I don’t know Fin. I’m with Tom I’ve seen enough deer with my dad to know this isn’t right.”

 

“What do you think Jake?” They all turned to me, Sam and Tom begging me for a semblance of sane judgement with their eyes.

 

“I say we check it out.”

 

I never was a praying man. Never believed in the good book, or ghosts, or aliens, or anything outside the realm of scientific explanation. In front of me was something new. I had seen what the natural had to offer and deemed it dull. Here was the unnatural, fully realised, and I wanted in.

 

The tunnel was a tight squeeze even for me, I don’t dare to imagine how tight it was for Tom. Its walls crumbling around me with each scrape of my body as I inched closer to the chamber. Fin had already made it, frantically cranking the lever of his torch to keep the space lit.  Roots invaded the dried earth like blood in a vein ebbing with activity. My laces would be snagged making it, so I had to yank myself free. Snapping each root in the process sounded more like a bone breaking then it did wood. By the time I made the chamber Fin could make out the whistling sound further in. Still distant but shifting in volume as it manoeuvred throughout the system. Fin clutched my hands, his torch going out in the process, and dragged me through into the chamber.

 

Tom had only just reached halfway. Shifting his bulk tirelessly against the earth.

 

“I think I’m stuck!”

 

“No you’re not Tom! Trust me, you’re panicking. You need to control your breathing and inch yourself through one step at a time.” Fin could be a leader when he wanted to be.

 

“Okay, okay, I’m coming.”

 

I could hear him panting. Caught in a finger trap. The more he panicked the tighter the space, the tighter the space the more he panicked.

 

“I can’t! I just can’t! Jesus Christ I- I- I can’t move. Oh God I can’t move!”

 

“Sam, can you hear me back there!” Fin called out

 

Silence.

 

“Sam!”  Fin shouted.

 

“Tin Man’s already gone Fin!” Tom shouted in a half laugh.

 

“What are you talking about?”

 

“He wouldn’t help Fin. You seen the way he talks about deer. Just watches it happen. I heard that toy of his rattling away as soon as I entered. He’s got no heart about him.”

 

“Fuck! We’ll pull you through Tom. We can fashion some rope with our bags and tie it around your arms and pull.”

 

“No, no, no! Not forward. I want out man! Tie my legs.”

 

“All right, me and Jake will find another way out and we’ll get you out. Hang in there man.”’

 

“Leave me a light!”

 

“What?”

 

“Please leave a light at the end. I can’t reach the one in my pocket…. I don’t want to be left in the dark.”

 

Fin nodded to me and I placed my torch on the ground. Saying our goodbyes we advanced through the chamber. We took turns with Fin’s torch cranking the lever and pointing out a direction only to be surrounded in dark once again. Over and over we would be bathed in light and then engulfed by the abyss. An endless cycle. Perception, clarity, salvation. Unknown, unwelcoming, oblivion. The chamber was one in a series of mangled monstrosities of earth. A varying degree of dried and dilapidated soil against slick wet rock watering at the cheeks with our arrival. The tunnel would appear wide upon entering and yet slowly shrink the further we entered. By the time we reached our fifth chamber Fin called for me to listen. The whistle was louder here and growing louder the longer we stayed. I followed Fin’s lead and flattened against the wall listening and waiting.

 

The light appeared in the narrowest tunnel of the chamber. A pair of blue orbs entered in a double act shriek. A high-pitched wail as it passed through to the middle. Wobbling in the air and waving from left to right uncertain of its path. Aimless and lost it had found its way into this place much like us. Unsure of where to go. Suddenly one of the orbs was knocked of balance by the other’s indecisiveness and was sent hurtling towards the wall with the other promptly leaving.

 

The light smashed into the soil with a thud. Liquidating and absorbing into the cracks with light dissipating into a damp patch lost to the dark. I cranked the lever of the torch watching the soil shift in a grotesque fashion, its many cracks filling with growing roots and blackening with a growing mould. The mould grew in depth and width, a dizzying pattern decorating its mass with the veins complementing its visage in the outline of eyes, cheeks and a mouth. Contorted and fixed in a scream of pain and anguish the mass ceased its growth and lay dormant to the soils struggle to sustain it. Void of substance the mass dissipated crumbling to dust and soon the light reappeared and entered the neighbouring chamber.

 

We continued our crawl through the system. Sometimes we’d hear a whistle and see a light. Sometimes we just sat there on the chamber floor exhausted unable to crank the lever and opting to sit there in the dark. We didn’t speak. No one really spoke to me when we were alone. I was bored with everything. Bored of my normal life, with my normal parents, and my normal friends. That is to say I assumed they lived the same as me. I believed that my experiences were so uninteresting that they weren’t worth mentioning. Now I think back on that night and think the same, only for different reasons.

 

By the time we made it out of the system we were only a few miles from the lake. Tom was right. Sam wasn’t there. A name among a list of missing kids lost to the woods. He hasn’t been seen since. An orchestra of screams echoed from across the lake. Voices young and old, male and female, all terrified and crying. Me and Fin darted along the bank towards the tunnel. My legs aching like they were filled with ants biting me with the build up of lactic acid. I stumbled only to be lifted back up by Fin still sprinting towards the tunnel.

 

The sound was indescribable. The crunch of bones, the pop of joints, the leaking of blood, the cries of generations lost in a system in search of a husk. The crank of the torch whipped rapidly round and round the light jolting to life and invading the tunnel. Filled in all the way to the entrance. A mangle of legs and arms, 6 fingered hands and double footed legs. Eyes large and small, wide and tall, leaking pools of tears and blood. Puss filled blisters bursting and oozing toxic bile across the mass leaving it red and raw. Smelling of rot and spoiled meat, like sewage, like the smell of history embodied in a vessel.  The eyes blinked, some slowly and some sideways, squinting against the light. An entanglement of lips and chins smooth and cleft bursting with insurmountable gums and disarrayed teeth. Cavernous, smooth, cracked, and cavitied. Yellow, white, grey and black. Projecting a waterfall of sour vomit into the pit of deer.

 

My legs shaking buckled with exhaustion as I crashed to my knees losing my grip on the torch. I could hear Fin next to me crying. The beat of his heart growing rapid as if about to burst before I heard the squelch of his boots against the riverbank running away. I propped myself on to my hands staring at the dark silhouetted void their cries growing louder and louder into ungodly wails. A loud wet pop erupted from within muffled against the mass causing a wave of groans from within rising in volume as it passed beneath each segment. Breaking its way through the monstrosity it burst from the growth like a bullet from a gun towards me. I dove franticly as the light whizzed past my shoulder into the night sky.

 

My heart racing my trembling hands searched for the torch the sound rooted me to the forest floor in a grovel before the mass. I couldn’t move, couldn’t think, couldn’t even dare to look away from the mud caked ground beneath me. Then suddenly just as it had begun, it suddenly stopped. A lay there panting and waiting as the lights erupted from the vessel and into the pit. Waves upon waves of deer scattering from within hitting me with their hooves as they passed.

 

I walked the woods aimlessly without direction long after the sun had risen. Hitting a tree and budding off of it into another direction I walked half drunk and delirious through the cave of greenery until the sanctuary of my back door came into sight.

 

Upon examining myself I found a small eye in the middle of my right shoulder. Bloodshot its pupil danced against the bathroom light and then the torch of the doctor. It had formed a close network my blood vessels. Removal was impossible. For a long time I believed it was intelligent. It would close almost in sleep at night and cry against my shirt at certain phrases. I tried that alphabet thing that’s used with paralysed patients. “Blink once when I arrive on a letter you want.” Nonsense. Couldn’t even string together a word.

 

All of that seems incomparable to Tom. My sweet friend. I shouldn’t have pushed him. I shouldn’t have suggested we look for the lights. If somehow, you’re reading this and your light has found the husk of a person somewhere, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. God words can’t even begin to describe the guilt I feel around your death. About how I couldn’t find the tunnel again with the police. I’m sorry, that I can’t pull myself together even for your sake. I’m sorry that the life I live in your name is one of drink.  I only pray that you have found something better then this. The eye on my shoulder has been reading along as I write, and now it has even begun to cry.
