My husband brought home a box.

He didn’t expect me to see it, of course. I’d come home from work at noon, afraid I’d suddenly caught the flu, and hadn’t yet told him.

“Oh,” he said, staring at where I sat at the kitchen table.

That was it. “Oh.”

The cardboard box so was tinged with red that I could barely read the black numbers “1913” printed on one side. Crimson liquid dribbled from the soggy corner, collecting on his palm and staining his shirt.

We both look at the ground behind him. He was carrying a plastic trash bag that looked to be full of red liquid and soft chunks.

Neither one of us spoke for several seconds. 

My blood ran cold. Mel wasn’t a violent man; in fact, he was boring to a fault. So what the hell was I seeing?

“I came home sick,” I sputtered.

He finally made eye contact. I don’t know how to explain what I saw other than that the man looking back was clearly my husband, but the mind was foreign to me. “Then maybe you should go to bed, Kate.”

I followed his advice without a word.

He left for the rest of the day. That night, he sent me a text saying that he suddenly had to go out of town for work, and that he would drive back from his motel in the morning.

He never goes out of town for work.  

So I lay in bed, my mind racing. Nothing made sense; he was clearly trying to hide something from me. He isn’t a hunter, so I know it wasn’t an animal in that box and bag, and he made no attempt to convince me of anything different. 

The blood could only mean one thing.

I stayed awake for hours, staring at the ceiling in dark silence. I finally resolved to get up and call my sister; I at least wanted to know that I wasn’t going crazy, and I needed another opinion. I was about to sit up when I noticed a shadow move.

I froze. Even my heart seemed to stop beating. 

The shadow glided so quietly that I wouldn’t have noticed anything if I hadn’t just spent hours in the dark and quiet. It was clearly a person, and they were obviously very experienced at hiding themselves. 

I kept still, feigning sleep. The person walked in near silence as they approached the bedroom door.

And as he crossed a sliver of moonlight that had crept through the curtains, I saw my husband’s face. 

He slipped out the door and disappeared. 

Now what?

I can’t run away, because he’s obviously been tracking me far longer than I know. I can’t confront him, because he would never confess to something violent (unless he planed to admit the truth and then kill me). There’s no evidence to show the police. 

I guess I’ll just wait to see what happens. 

I’ll share what that is if I [survive the night](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).
