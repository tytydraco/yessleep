“ You Are What You Eat, From The Point Pf View Of Monster “ 

 Chapter 1 “ You Are What You Eat “

#  You ever heard the saying You Are What You Eat. No how about don’t play with your food.  I find these things to be the exact opposite in my case.

In the heart of an eerie forest, where the moonlight struggles to pierce I dwell, A creature known as the Forgotten One. I am an entity shrouded in the darkness of ancient curses and the whispers of the unknown. The Enigma of Existence is shrouded even for me. All I know is I have always been and so shall I always be.

My past is a tapestry of shadows and silence. I have has no recollection of my inception, only the vague sense that i was once something... different. My form is a grotesque parody of life, a collection of limbs and eyes that defy the laws of nature.
My ears hear the Echoes of a Former Self.

Occasionally, I experiences echoes of a former self—a laugh that once belonged to me, a touch i once felt. Yet, these echoes are as fleeting as dreams, slipping away before they can be understood. Who was I? What was I? These questions linger, unanswered and unanswerable.

My Unusual Diet forces me to feed on the emotions of others—joy and terror are my nourishment. This peculiar diet is not out of malice but necessity, for I can no longer experience emotions of my own. Stripped of the capacity to feel, my drive is an insatiable hunger for what it cannot have.

## The Misinterpreted Creature

To those who encounter it, the Forgotten One is a monster, a being of pure malevolence. But this is a misconception. It is not inherently evil; it is merely misunderstood. It is a victim of circumstance, a prisoner of its own existence.

## The Cycle of Sustenance

Each night, the Forgotten One roams the forest, drawn to the beacons of fear from travelers and animals the secret fears that dwell within their souls. It wishes no harm, but its existence demands it feed. Thus, it is caught in a perpetual cycle of consumption and confusion, remembrance and remorse.

# You Are What You Eat: The Encounter

Perched high within the embrace of an ancient oak, I observed with a multitude of eyes. The group of five humans, unaware of the gaze that followed their every move, set up camp in a clearing that had never been touched by the sun's warmth.

I began my haunting symphony by allowing the branches to sway and creak unnaturally, as if the wind itself whispered secrets of dread. The leaves rustled with a sinister intent, and a low, guttural growl echoed through the forest, a sound not of this world.

Below, Kevin and Sinclair, embroiled in a heated argument, were too caught up in their own turmoil to notice the eerie stillness that befell their friends.

**Kevin:** "Clair, can we not do this here? Everyone's watching."

**Sinclair:** "No, Kevin! I'm tired of pretending everything's fine!"

As Sinclair stormed off, Kevin followed, his pleas drowned out by the increasing tension.


Sinclair's retreat was halted by a gruesome sight—a carcass, torn and mangled, lay before them. 

**Sinclair:** *(gasping)* "What... what happened here?"

**Kevin:** "It's just an animal, Clair. Let's... let's get back to the others."

The group, drawn by Sinclair's cry, gathered around, their faces a mix of curiosity and horror.

**Mia:** "Is that a deer? It's been completely shredded!"

**Ethan:** "Guys, maybe we should leave. This doesn't feel right. This is literally how ever scary movie starts off”

**Liam:** "No way. We've come too far to turn back now. It's probably just bears. Calm down"

(The forgotten one)
But I was the harbinger of their fear, the sculptor of their dread. I needed them to fear, to feel, so it could feedddddd. For some reason fear tasted better than happiness and hate, but hate tasted pretty good too i thought to myself while lurking.

As night fell, I descended from my perch, invisible in the darkness. I moved closer, my presence a cold shadow.

**Sinclair:** "Do you feel that? It's like... we're being watched."

**Kevin:** "It's just the woods, Clair. There's nothing out here. Besides we came armed to the teeth” he said cradling the the shot gun sitting in his lap.

(The forgotten one)
But I was there, and it was hungry. It brushed past the tents, careful to stay just outside of the campfires light. When you’ve been around as long as I have you learned tricks. For instances I learned by channeling sound through my nostrils and controlling my pitch I could mimic human voices. Like how you humans whistle. 
“ Miiiaaa “

**Mia:** "Did anyone hear that? It sounded like... someone calling my name."

**Ethan:** "I didn't hear anything. You're just scaring yourself."

**Liam:** "Let's just keep the fire going. We'll be fine."

I circled them, a predator in the night, my form shifting with each step. I was not evil, but I was desperate. I fed on their happiness, their fear, and in doing so, I remembered the faintest traces of emotions I once knew.

So they thought the fire would protect them the I thought inhaling the black smoke as it rose up the tree I was hanging on to. So if I extinguish it I can extinguish their courage. I jumped from tree to tree without so much as a sound. Another trick learned throughout the ages. It’s hard When hunting things down at my hulking size if they hear you coming. So you learn to be stealth. I positioned myself above there camp grounds. I gargled a thick mucus like slime and spit it out at a high velocity targeted right at there campfire. 
Listen to those SCREAMSSSS I thought relishing in my hunger. I let out a huge rooooaaarrrrr

(# You Are What You Eat: The Chaos at the Campfire)

The night had fallen heavy upon our campsite, the kind of darkness that felt thick enough to slice through. We were laughing around the fire, the flames casting dancing shadows upon our faces, when suddenly, a viscous mucus rained down upon our campfire, hissing and sputtering as it extinguished our only source of comfort.

**Liam:** "What the—"

Before he could finish, an unholy roar shattered the silence, vibrating through the very ground we stood on. Panic erupted. We scattered like leaves in a storm, the darkness swallowing us whole.

**Mia's POV:**
I could barely see a thing, but I could hear the frantic footsteps of my friends. My heart was pounding in my ears, a staccato rhythm that matched my sprinting. Then, suddenly, I was flying, my face meeting the cold, hard ground.

**Liam's POV:**
Damn it! I tripped over Mia. "Sorry!" I yelled, scrambling to my feet, pulling her up with me. "We've got to get out of here!"

We stumbled and clawed our way to the car, our breaths coming out in ragged gasps. But the sight that greeted us was a gut punch—four slashed tires stared back at us, mocking our escape.

**Ethan:** "You've got to be kidding me!"

We piled into the car anyway, the illusion of safety behind closed doors. Guns were distributed, the metallic clicks of cocking pistols and rifles punctuating the heavy air.

**Sinclair:** "Where's Kevin?"

The question hung in the air, a specter more terrifying than any monster. We looked at each other, the same realization dawning on us. Kevin wasn't here.

**Mia:** "He was right behind us, wasn't he?"

**Ethan:** "Kevin's a big boy; he can handle himself."

**Liam:** "Yeah, against a bear maybe, but this? This is something else."

**Sinclair:** "We can't just leave him out there!"

The car was filled with the sound of our racing hearts and heavy breathing. Fear had settled in, a tangible presence that fed the creature lurking outside.

**Ethan:** "Okay, okay, let's think. We have guns. We can go look for him."

**Mia:** "Are you out of your mind? Something fucking huge is out there!"

**Liam:** "Mia's right. We need to stay put. Kevin knows that."

**Sinclair:** "I can't believe this is happening..."

 Chapter  4

# You Are What You Eat: The Feast of 

the chaos below was a symphony of survival instincts. The humans scattered, their fear a beacon that called to the deepest part of its being. Among them, one's terror shone brightest—Kevin.

**The Forgotten One's POV:**
As they fled, my senses sharpened, zeroing in on the bulky one in the back of the group. The air was thick with his fear, a scent that overpowered all reason. In a moment of primal need, I surged forward, propelled by an insatiable hunger.

With a swift motion, my tail ensnared the source of the potent fear. Kevin dangled helplessly as I ascended to the treetops, his screams a melody to my ears. Suspended above the car, I indulged in the feast before me.

The memories—oh, how they flooded in! The taste of terror mingled with the sweet remnants of joy, a combination that was exquisite and complex. It was a flavor that defied description, a satisfaction that was both fulfilling and hollow.

As I fed, I could feel the echoes of emotions that were no longer mine to experience. Each memory consumed brought a fleeting sense of what I had lost, a reminder of the emptiness that would never be filled.

Below, the humans huddled in their metal sanctuary, their fear a constant hum that sustained me. Yet, amidst the feast, there was a pang of something unfamiliar—a twinge of regret? No, such feelings were not for me. I was the Forgotten One, a creature beyond the realm of human emotions. It must’ve been this meal feeling these feelings and not me.

And so, I continued to feed, the Forgotten One in the night, a monster not by nature, but by necessity.

Chapter 5 
 
The group were scanning every visible tree line looking for Kevin with no results. Damnit Kevin Clair said and as if in response Kevin’s withered up body dropped down on the hood of the car with a loud thud. The group yelled in unison.

As the group reels from the shock of Kevin’s fate, they realize that the forest, once a place of adventure, has become a labyrinth of terror. With no time to grieve, they must make a choice: to stay and face the unknown horror or to attempt an escape with no guarantee of safety.
“We have to go, NOW!” I scream, my voice barely recognizable.
Ethan nodded pushing past the paralyzing fear. “Split up,” lliam commanded. “It can’t follow all of us.”
Tears blur my vision as I bolt into the woods, the underbrush clawing at my legs. “This can’t be happening,” I sob.
Liam followed Mia, his mind racing. We need a plan, but all I can think of is survival.
The group scatters, their footsteps echoing through the forest as they desperately seek refuge. The Forgotten One watches, its hunger momentarily satisfied, but the night is long, and the game has just begun.

 Sinclair dashes through the dense underbrush, her mind a whirlwind of panic and sorrow. The thorns tear at her clothes, but the physical pain is nothing compared to the terror gripping her heart. She runs blindly, not knowing where she is going, only that she must get away from the nightmare that has claimed Kevin.

Ethan, with a survivalist’s resolve, moves with more purpose. He knows that staying still is tantamount to a death sentence. His breaths come in ragged gasps as he navigates the treacherous terrain, leaping over fallen logs and ducking under low-hanging branches. He’s driven by a single thought: to find help and save his friends.

Mia’s escape is frenzied and tear-filled. She stumbles repeatedly, her sobs echoing through the trees. The darkness is suffocating, and every shadow seems to move. She feels utterly alone, her fear a constant companion that urges her to keep moving, even when her body begs to stop.
Liam’s Lament: Liam follows Mia, trying to keep her in sight. His protective instincts are in overdrive, but he’s also acutely aware of the danger they’re in. He calls out to Mia, trying to offer words of comfort, but his voice is drowned out by the abundant sounds of the forest at night.


In the heart of the forest, where darkness reigns as the sole monarch, the Forgotten One moves with a grace that belies its grotesque form. Its many limbs, a macabre orchestra of appendages, carry it silently through the underbrush, each step calculated and precise. The creature's multitude of eyes, like orbs of obsidian, gleam with an otherworldly light, piercing through the veil of night with ease.

**The Forgotten One's POV:**
The scent of fear is intoxicating, a potent aroma that fills the air with every panicked breath the humans exhale. Liam and Mia, their presence in my domain, ignite a primal hunger within me, a yearning that claws at the edges of my consciousness. Their fear is a lighthouse in the pitch-black sea of the forest, guiding me to them with pin point accuracy.

As I weave through the trees, my form shifts and shudders, a shadow come to life. The whispers of leaves under my touch are hushed, conspiring with me in this deadly game of cat and mouse. My elongated fingers, tipped with claws that can rend flesh from bone, twitch with anticipation, eager for the feast that awaits.

Liam and Mia's flight is a desperate dance, a frenetic attempt to escape the inevitable. Their footsteps are heavy against the soft earth, a staccato rhythm that quickens

The Forgotten One, a behemoth of nightmares, closes the distance between itself and the fleeing pair. Its movement is a silent thunder, a predatory ballet performed in the theater of shadows. The forest itself seems to recoil with each of the creature’s strides, the natural world bowing to the supremacy of this apex predator.

(The Forgotten One’s POV): In the countless years of my existence, I have feasted upon the spectrum of human emotions, but courage—a flavor so rare in my world—has eluded me. They all cower, they all flee, for none can stand against the terror of my eight-foot stature. But now, as I loom over Liam and Mia, I sense a new essence in the air. It is the aroma of bravery, and it piques my curiosity.

Liam turns to face me, his body tensed like a bowstring drawn tight. In his eyes, I see the flicker of determination, the flame of defiance. It is a remarkable sight, one that stirs the ancient dust of memories long forgotten. For a moment, I pause, savoring this novel experience.
My form is a grotesque tapestry woven from the nightmares of man and beast alike. I am both bear and human, my body a hulking mass of muscle and fur, my limbs ending in claws that could tear through steel as though it were parchment. My face, if it could be called that, is a mangled visage of snarling maws and snouts, a visage that has never known the touch of kindness, only the cold embrace of isolation.

As I advance, the ground trembles beneath my weight, and the air grows thick with the electric charge of imminent confrontation. Liam stands his ground, a testament to the indomitable human spirit, while Mia watches, her breath caught in the cage of her chest.
The night holds its breath, the forest a silent witness to this dance of predator and prey, where for the first time, I tastes the sweet wine of courage for the first time, a flavor as complex as it is unexpected. 
Needless to say the one known as Liam didn’t last before my might. Mia darted away while I was preoccupied with Liam. 

(Mia)
Omg omg omg Mia sprinted through the thick brush too scared to look back. We gotta get out of here. Shit shit shit she panted. 

Mia burst through the underbrush, her face a mask of terror and exertion. She stumbled into the clearing where Clair and Ethan stood, their own faces etched with concern.
Mia: (panting) “It’s Liam… the creature, it took him!”
Clair: “What? What do you mean ‘took him’?”
Ethan: “Where is he? Did you see where that thing went?”
Mia shook her head, trying to catch her breath, her words tumbling out in a rush.
Mia: “It was so fast, it just… snatched him up and disappeared into the trees. We have to do something!”
Clair: “We need to get out of here, call for help!”
Ethan, with shaking hands, pulled out his phone and dialed 911. The line clicked, and for a moment, there was hope.
Ethan: “Yes, hello? We need help. There’s something in the forest with us—”
But before he could finish, the Forgotten One emerged from the shadows, its towering form casting a pall over the group. To their astonishment, it simply watched, its many eyes fixed on the phone in Ethan’s hand.
Clair: (whispering) “It’s letting us call for help…”
The creature’s gaze was unblinking, and an eerie silence fell over the clearing. Ethan continued to speak with the dispatcher, his voice a mix of relief and fear.
Ethan: “Please, send someone quickly. We’re at—”
As Clair uttered the words “of sending help,” the Forgotten One’s demeanor shifted. The air grew colder, and the creature let out a low, menacing growl that reverberated through the forest.
(The Forgotten One’s POV: )i could disrupt there human contraptions that allow communication over long ranges but I had allowed them this small glimmer of hope, a cruel game to heighten their fear. Also, I had become obsessed with the taste of courage and if more creatures where going to rescue these pathetic insects surely they to will exhibit the delicious taste of courage too.
