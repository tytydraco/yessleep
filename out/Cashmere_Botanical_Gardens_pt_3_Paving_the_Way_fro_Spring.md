**April 6th**

I haven't written in a few days, I wanted to be sure that I had something worth writing about before I did.

I think I saw Chuck tonight.

I think I saw a few of the people that are supposed to have gone missing.

The  last four nights have been filled with strange little occurrences. The  trees are still moving at night. I can hear their voice boxes at night,  but they seem to be taking great pains to avoid me. I would find them in  other rings sometimes, but they stayed put whenever I was looking at  them. We had come to a silent agreement that I wouldn't bother them if  they didn't bother me.

No, the weirdness started with a series of strange thefts.

I had just gotten to sleep the day after the incident with the trees, when I got a call from Carl, the security supervisor.

“Hey, sorry to wake you, did you happen to see anyone in the park last night?”

I  started to tell him about the trees, it was on the tip of my tongue to  tell him everything, but instead I just told him I hadn't seen another  person till Randy got there that morning.

“Sucks that the cameras went out. The grounds keepers are saying that their missing two bags of concrete.”

“Concrete?”  I asked, barely awake as I tried to get my wits about me. It had taken  several hours to get to a point where I could sleep, and I was beginning  to think I wasn't going to get any before work that night. The sleeping  pills had made me extremely groggy, though, and I was having trouble  following the conversation.

“Yeah,  two bags, and a wheelbarrow. Keep an eye peeled tonight, alright? If  someone is sneaking in and messing with the camera so they can steal  things, I want it to stop.”

I told him I would keep an eye peeled, and hung up before rolling over to get back to bed.

That night, there was a folder sitting on the desk of the security detail office.

Randy  tapped it when I came in and looked at me with a worried stare, “Carl  was here for like an hour and a half today. He says the guys in  maintenance are missing some stuff.”

“Yeah,” I said, with a nod, “He told me earlier. A whole bunch of concrete or something right?”

“More than that now. They’re missing wheelbarrows, some gardening tools, and a whole bunch of weed killer for some reason.”

“Who  the hell would want that much weed killer?” I asked as I took the  folder and looked inside. Randy hadn’t been joking. Someone had stolen  almost 20 gallons of industrial weed killer. It was the kind that would  kill damn near anything, weeds included. Something like that used at the  wrong time could really mess this place up.

“  I don’t know. Carl says to just keep an eye on the cameras tonight. If  they go out again, he wants to know about it immediately. Call him on  his cell, even if it wakes him up. He says that Dr. Thurston is pretty  upset about all this. Apparently there hasn’t been a theft at the  botanical gardens for quite some time.”

He left then, and I got my equipment on so I could start doing my nightly checks.

I  had just gotten to the Lilypond on my first check in the night, when,  as if summoned by his name, I saw Mr. Thurston standing around the edge  of the pond.

He was alone, the  guest, no more than a few oldsters taking a last walk before they left,  and as I came up, he seemed lost and thought. He was mumbling to  himself, all while keeping an eye on the Pale Lady. They seem to be  having a very intense conversation, and whatever he was hearing back  from her he didn’t seem to like it.

“Not going to let you ruin this place for me.” I heard him say, just as I came up beside him.

“ Dr. Thurston?”

He jumped, as if a goose and walked over his grave, but he was all smiles when he turned back to look at me.

“You gave me quite a freight,” he said, “ how are you settling into Night Shift? Had any more trouble with fainting spells?”

“  No, sir, it’s OK I guess. Awfully spooky around here at night, though.  Always seems like I can hear voices and catch shadows late at night.”

Dr.  Thurston chuckled, “ I imagine some of that might change once those  damn trees are gone. They weren’t my first choice, but the educational  grant money that we got for housing them was worth the headache. They do  make quite caterwauling.”

He went back to looking at the pale lady, and I joined him in silence for a few moments before he asked a strange question.

“Is she one of the shadows you see sometimes?”

I didn’t know how to respond, would he believe me if I told him I thought this lady statue proud around at night?

He  laughed again, putting an old hand on my shoulder, “ I’m just teasing  you boy. You know, the statue was my contribution to the Gardens when I  became the Director ten years ago.”

“ I had no idea, sir.”

He looked back at the statue, but his face was an odd mixture of pride and contempt.

“My  father had been a lover of horticulture and biology. He had been  something of a botanist himself, scoured, the world for strange plants,  and odd flora. He claimed to have found the statue in an old temple  somewhere in deepest India. He brought it home and put it in his own  garden, and said that it made his plants bloom as if summer never ended.  He may have loved the statue, but I lived in fear of it. When he died, I  could no longer stand to have that strange statue looking at me  whenever I walked the grounds of his estate. So I brought it here, so  that whatever strange energy it has could benefit the botanical gardens.  I am grateful to whatever effect it has on this place, but I still have  a great deal of fear and respect for it.”

He left shortly there after, and I continued my rounds, as I made ready to close the gardens.

The  first few nights weren’t so bad. I felt watched as I made my rounds,  and I caught sight of things out of the corner of my eye. The trees,  thankfully, did not move again, but something was moving in the  botanical gardens. They were normal sized things, people, perhaps, but  they were far too quick for me to see. I tried to ignore them, thinking  it was more of the strangeness, and it made the trees move, and the next  day, there was a new folder on my desk.

Maintenance  was reporting more thefts. Their industrial sprayers were gone, as well  as the remainder of their weed killer. Someone had also taken the keys  to the truck that held their biggest sprayer, the one they use for pest  control. Carl and Randy we’re at a loss, and when Carl asked me again if  I had seen anything, I told him I hadn’t seen anything out of the  ordinary last night. I should’ve told him about feeling watched, but I  didn’t want to seem paranoid. This was a good job, and I really needed  to keep doing it. So I put up with the weirdness and what about my night  as I had the ones before it.

The  next night, however, Carl spent half of my shift furiously sifting  through security footage. Someone had broken into the botany labs behind  the gardens, and taken something that he couldn’t tell me about. It was  all very hush-hush he said, but it was something that we could get into  a lot of trouble for if anyone found out about it.

“The  techs signed nondisclosure agreements before they started working on  it. It was for a company that would prefer not to be mentioned either.  If someone stole it, and that company finds out we lost it, we could be  in for a lot of fines, and a lot of heartache.”

He left around midnight, having found nothing on the cameras besides the occasional burst of static.

The  weirdest thing to me was in all this time I had only run into the lady  and she took her evening walk once. I knew that she moved around at  night, but I had seen her in her pond pretty much constantly. Don’t  misunderstand, I didn’t want to see her again. Running into her was  really the last thing I wanted, but I was intrigued by her intentions,  and what interest she had in the gardens. After Doctor Thurston’s story,  I began to wonder if maybe his father really had found something  magical in India. Some old totem to a harvest goddess, or maybe  something darker.

There was no new report when I came in tonight, but there was certainly something to see.

Randy  was in high spirits when I came in. He handed me a cup of coffee,  sweetened just the way I like it, and told me how everything had been  where it was supposed to be when he gotten here this morning. Not that  the stolen things had magically returned, we were all still under the  spotlight for that experiment that had gone missing, but nothing new has  been added to the list today, so that was good.

“I  guess maybe the heat had gotten a little too hot for whoever keeps  breaking in. Maybe they found somewhere a little cooler to do their  burglary at.”

I nodded, hoping so.  I really hoped I wouldn’t have to spend all night looking over my  shoulder for whoever had been following me. It made me a bit paranoid,  and that kind of thing will eat at you after a while. I said good night  to Randy, and after the park was closed I mostly did rounds and watched  cameras. It was only a matter of time till they started blaming me for  these nighttime burglaries, and I really wanted to catch something so  that I could redeem myself just a little bit.

As  if on cue, I started seeing things dart in and out of the camera. It  was similar to the flashes of static that I saw when the statue moved,  but these were definitely movements. Creatures that looked vaguely human  would move at the edges of the camera, a little too quick for me to  see. Still, my eyes found them. I grabbed my flashlight, and decided to  go investigate. I knew there wasn’t much I could do if they had come in a  group, but maybe just the realization that they weren’t alone would be  enough to scare them off.

I moved  quietly through the dark gardens, the overhead lamps creating little  islands of light in the murky blackness. I could hear something, but I  wasn’t immediately sure what it was. It almost sounded like  construction, but who would be doing construction in the middle of the  night? The tree voices bombarded me as I walked past the Governor's  ring, but it couldn’t quite block out the sound I had heard earlier. All  the trees were still where they should be, so I felt confident that  they weren’t the ones making all the racket.

No, I told myself.

They weren’t all here.

Three  of them were missing, and I couldn’t believe that I hadn’t noticed  them. They were the three biggest trees in the exhibit, likely having  been brought in with several forklifts, and they were all just gone. Had  they left on their own? I didn’t know, but as I turned my face back  towards the noise, I figured I was about to find out.

The area around the lily pond turned out to be the source of the noise.

I  hunkered at the edge of the exhibit, and watched as a half dozen  hunched figures went about their work. They were mixing and pouring  concrete, cutting wood and making rough tables, constructing seats out  of stone and wood, and building something in the lily pond. I couldn’t  tell what they were. They were only vaguely human, but much too hairy  and muscles to be actual humans. the longer I looked the more I thought I  could see horns sprouting from the top of their curly hair, and  wondered where they had come from so suddenly?

The longer I observe them, the more familiar faces there seemed to be.

They  should look familiar, I suppose. Many of them were faces I had seen on  the posters in the break room, the ones detailing missing employees. One  of them pouring concrete looked a little like the smiling botanist who  had gone missing last year. The one lifting a large concrete stone with  one hand looked a little like the middle-aged woman who had worked in  groundskeeping. This could’ve all been a mistake, my mind playing tricks  on me, but when I heard something snort behind me, I turned and found  someone that there was no mistaking.

Chuck  was pushing a wheelbarrow, his hair now long and brown and his eyes  like a cat. I could look past the faces by the pond, I had only seen  them on missing posters, but there was no miss remembering Chuck. I had  seen him quite often, and despite the changes to him, I still recognized  him. The wheelbarrow made a harsh sound as it fell, and two of us just  stared at each other for a few seconds before I could find my voice.

“Chuck? Is that you?”

Chuck  looked startled. He took a step away from the wheelbarrow, and it  looked like he wanted to use his hand to cover himself. He seemed  ashamed to be seen like this, and when he spoke, his voice was nothing  like the deep baritone it had been before. It sounded like someone  pretending at a deep voice, and a falsetto all at once. He sounded like  nothing so much as a sentient hive of bees that’s learned to speak  through some strange sorcery.

“You shouldn’t be here. You’re not supposed to be here. Get out, get out before it’s too late.”

I  took a step back, but got control of myself pretty quickly, “Come with  me. We can go talk to Doctor Thurstan. Maybe there’s some way he can,”

“No,”  he cut me off bruskly, “I don’t need saving, but you might. Get out of  here, get out of here before it’s too late. There are things happening  here that you don’t understand. You need to leave while you still can.”

He looked like he wanted to say more, but every word seemed to put him at odds with himself.

When  a sudden guttural scream erupted behind me, the sound of a beehive  falling down a flight of stairs, I turned to see that one of the other  creatures had seen me, and was pointing with an accusing finger.

I ran for my life.

It’s  amazing sometimes what adrenaline will do. I could hear the sound of  hooves on the concrete behind me, and the clatter made it hard to tell  how many there were. Two, three, a dozen, it hardly mattered. I had  watched one of them lift a slab of concrete that looked like it weighed  as much as eight hundred pounds. One of them would be enough to kill me,  and I knew it.

As the security hut came into view, I breathed a sigh of relief before wondering why?

A door would be childsplay for this gang of billygoats, but it hardly mattered.

I  turned to slam it in their faces, and got a split second view of a pack  of angry monsters. Their teeth looked huge as they gnashed from their  lips. Their arms pumped wildly and the cords that showed on them bulged  dangerously. They were a pack of bacchanalian revealers, a group of  pissed off satyrs, and as I slammed the door and ran the bolt, I already  had my cell phone out.

“911 what’s your emergency?”

“I  need the police, the army, something to the Cashmere Botanical gardens.  I’m the security officer and I’m being attacked by something. I’ve,” at  that moment something hit the door hard enough to bow it in the frame  and I saw an arm attempt to poke into the gap, “I need someone here now.  They're almost through the door! Please God HELP ME!”

They  battered at the door as I yelled into the phone, and as the woman  assured me that help was in route, I hung up on her and dialed Carl.

He sounded groggy, but woke up quickly once he heard the banging, “What the hell is going on over there? Are you okay?”

“I  need help! I called the cops but I need to let you know in case  something happens to me. They're working for the statue, the one in the  lily pond. She’s been making them steal things. They're the ones who  have stolen all the tools and concrete and stuff. They're building  something, they're making something and I don’t know what to do.”

“Slow  down, kid. You aren’t making any sense. I’ll be down there in about ten  minutes with everyone I can lay hands on. Just stay safe. There's a  flare gun in the box under the desk. It’s only got one shot so try not  to waste it and only if you really,” his last words were blotted out as  something bent the door enough to reach their arm all the way in.

I  dropped the phone in surprise and backpedaled until I ran into the  desk. The hand was like a furry spider, scuttling around the door as it  looked for the clasp. The door wasn’t much protection at this point, it  was bent almost in two and I wasn’t sure why the hand was trying to open  it when it would be easy to just knock it down. I didn’t question my  good luck. I just reached for the case Carl had told me about and popped  the safety latch as gauze and bandages and antibiotics spilled onto the  floor.

The flare gun clunked onto the desk, and I scoop it up as the hand seemed to find the latch.

I  took aim, though it was very shaky. I had never been much of a  marksman, to dads chagrin, but as I steadied my hands, I reminded myself  that I only had one shot. The thick fingers slipped off the lock, but  it seemed they were more curious to find where it was. As they returned  to it, I put a bead on them, and pulled the trigger.

I missed, but I missed spectacularly.

The  shot bounced off the doorframe and out the large hole the arm was  creeping through. I heard a sound that was part goat bleat and part  angry bee swarm, and the arm came out as whatever it was attached to  beat at itself and bellowed. It was joined by the clatter of hooves and  other plaintive cries, and I began to wonder what I would do when the  next hand came snaking through the crack?

I didn’t have to find out.

As  the blue and red lights filled my vision, the creatures took flight.  They clattered back down the sidewalk and away from the guard station as  swiftly as they had arrived. I sat on the floor, flare gun still in my  hand, and could do little but try to make my teeth stop chattering. I  had never felt closer to death in my life and as my breath tried to  catch itself, I wondered if it was really over.

When the police announced themselves and called out for security staff, I dropped the flare gun and told them I was here.

The EMT that looked me over was the same one from the other day.

“We gotta stop meeting like this. People are gonna talk, ya know.”

In  my current state, I didn’t even register his joke. The police had  helped me out of the smashed booth and deposited me with the ambulance  as they went in to check the park. I’d been sitting dutifully on the  stretcher, letting him examine me for about twenty minutes, when the  headlights of an SUV pinned the both of us in place.

The EMT looked a little nervous as the doors opened and four others climbed out.

Was this some new trick by the Pale Lady, or was it more cops showing up after the fact?

To  my surprise, it was Carl, and Randy, the new kid (Gabe), and at the  head of them all was Doctor Thurston. They approached the ambulance, and  as Carl asked the EMT about my status, Doctor Thurston brought his  seemed old face very close to mine. He seemed to be looking for  something, and when he didn’t find it, he calmed visibly and his usual  smile emerged like an autumn sunrise.

“Tell me the truth, boy. Did she make you drink anything? Did you eat anything? Did she take anything from you?”

I  shook my head and just kept on shaking it until he put a hand on either  side of my face and leaned in so close that I thought he was gonna kiss  me.

After a few minutes, he leaned away again, “He’s just scared, Carl. I don’t think she’s gotten ahold of him.”

“Well  thank Christ for that.” Carl said, signing something the EMT had put in  front of him and telling him they would take it from here, “Gabriel, go  tell the police that we’re taking our security guard to Doctor  Thurston’s office. If they have any more questions, they can find us  there.”

Gabe nodded, but Carl  stuck out a hand before he could go tearing off, “And don’t run, for God  sake. These cops are gonna be tense enough without you spooking them.  Come on, kid.” he said, putting an arm under me and helping me up, “Tell  us the whole story.”
