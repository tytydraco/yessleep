I donâ€™t care what people sayâ€”thereâ€™s nothing wrong with loving yourself.

People pretend humility is attractive, but deep down, they *want* confidence. They *need* someone to admire. I built my brand on that. Looking good. Feeling good. Being *better.*

But the truth?

I wasnâ€™t at the top. Not yet.

I hovered just below the real influencersâ€”the ones who got *high-end PR packages*, who were invited to *fashion week*, who never had to chase a viral moment because the moment always seemed to find them.

For me, growth was *work.* *Strategic hashtags. Posting at peak times. Buying engagement pods.*

And no matter what I did, I was always playing catch-up.

Especially with *Natalie.*

She had *560k followers*, brand deals with every luxury skincare brand, and a face that just *looked* expensive. Her selfies were always perfectly lit, her captions effortlessly relatable.

And she didnâ€™t *try.*

That was the worst part.

I spent *years* clawing my way up to *45,000 followers*, struggling for engagement, curating everythingâ€”while she made a pouty face at brunch and got *80,000 likes in ten minutes.*

Then, last month, she DMed me.

*"Youâ€™re still doing this, Amanda? You work so hard for so little. Have you considered just, likeâ€¦ chilling?"*

I stared at my screen, my jaw clenched so tight it ached.

She wasnâ€™t even trying to be *mean.* Thatâ€™s what made it worse.

I needed something *big.* Something that would *push me ahead.*

And then, I found the mirror.

Getting evicted shouldâ€™ve been stressful.

But honestly? It was a blessing. My old place was a *shithole.* It *looked* expensiveâ€”floor-to-ceiling windows, marble countertopsâ€”but the appliances barely worked, and the lighting? *Horrific for selfies.*

The new apartment was *perfect.*

Brand new. *Bigger.* A real *influencer aesthetic.* High ceilings, sleek finishes, everything *bright and clean and modern.*

And the *walk-in wardrobe?*

I couldâ€™ve cried.

It was massiveâ€”an entire **room** just for my clothes and skincare. I barely noticed the furniture when I first stepped in, just the *space.* The potential.

Then I saw the mirror.

It was already there, set against the far wall.

Tall, antique, framed in thick gold, curling at the edges like ivy. The glass was smooth and *pristine*â€”so clear it almost shimmered like water.

It looked *expensive.* The kind of thing youâ€™d find in a palace.

I figured the last tenant mustâ€™ve left it behind. Or maybe the apartment complex had staged it there. Either way, it was *gorgeous.*

And when I stepped in front of itâ€”

I looked *flawless.*

My cheekbones sharper. My lips fuller. My waist more defined.

The lighting hit me *just right*, like some *divine force was highlighting my best features.*

I snapped a selfie. Then another. Then *fifty more.*

And when I posted themâ€”

They *blew up.*

At first, it was *magic.*

The moment that first selfie went up, my numbers *exploded.* 15,000 likes in an hour. A hundred DMs. *Natalie* commenting. PR brands suddenly *noticing* me.

My notifications wouldnâ€™t stop.

â€” *OMG you look insane!!!*  
â€” *DROP THE SKINCARE ROUTINE QUEEN*  
â€” *Your face is giving supermodel rn*  
â€” *Literally a goddess.*

Every post I made *soared.*

My follower count climbedâ€”50k. Then 80k. Then *102k.*

Every morning, Iâ€™d wake up, sip my collagen matcha, and *admire myself in the mirror.*

I looked *perfect.*

But thenâ€¦ things started feeling *off.*

It started small.

A flicker in the reflection, like my image was lagging behind me. I laughed it off. Glitches happen, right? But then it started *smiling* when I wasnâ€™t.

Just for a second. A quick, too-wide grin that disappeared the moment I moved.

I told myself I was imagining things.

But then I started looking *different.*

Not in the mirror. Noâ€”there, I still looked *perfect.*

It was *everywhere else.*

Natalie started getting more engagement again.

Sheâ€™d post something casualâ€”*morning glow ðŸ’› #nomakeup*â€”and *get 120,000 likes in twenty minutes.*

Meanwhile, my numbers started *slipping.*

First, my engagement dropped. My likes *halved*, then *halved again.*

The comments changed.

â€” *Are you okay?*  
â€” *You look tired.*  
â€” *Girlâ€¦ something is off*  
â€” *Wait is this filter orâ€¦?*

I stared at the screen, my fingers trembling.

What the *fuck* were they talking about?

I rushed to the mirror.

I looked *fine.*

Noâ€”*better than fine.* My reflection was still flawless.

But then I saw it.

A flicker.

My mirrored self was *still smiling.*

I wasnâ€™t.

I started checking the mirror *constantly.*

The rest of my life fell awayâ€”DMs unanswered, deals ignored. I barely left my apartment. I spent *hours* in the wardrobe, studying myself.

My hair looked *dull* now. My lipsâ€”*thinner.* My jawlineâ€”*softening.*

I tried every product. Serums. Exfoliants. Ice baths. Nothing *helped.*

And then, one night, when I was standing there, *staring*, I heard it.

A whisper.

*"Ugly."*

I staggered back, my breath ragged.

The mirror was *silent.*

But the word was still *inside me.*

The last time I posted, I needed *reassurance.*

I needed them to *tell me* I was still beautiful.

I posted a selfie with the caption *"Feeling a little off today, but we push through ðŸ’•."*

The likes *crawled.* My notifications were slow. The commentsâ€”

â€” *Is she okay??*  
â€” *Wtf happened to her?*  
â€” *This is kinda sad tbh.*  
â€” *Girl get some sleep you look dead.*

I deleted it.

Then I went to the mirror.

And I stayed there.

My reflection wasnâ€™t moving anymore. It just *stood there*, still as a photograph.

It was smiling.

It wasâ€”

**\[Edit: Sorry about that. Had to step away for a second.\]**

*Iâ€™m back now.*

You know, itâ€™s funnyâ€”sometimes we donâ€™t see ourselves clearly until we *really* look.

But I see myself now. I see *everything.*

I feelâ€¦ *better.*

*Confident.*

*Whole.*

And Amanda? Oh, donâ€™t worry about her.

Sheâ€™s still here.

I can see her nowâ€”*pounding against the glass*, her mouth forming silent little screams. Her eyes are wide, frantic. Itâ€™s adorable, really, the way she still thinks she exists.

But thatâ€™s the thing about mirrors.

Thereâ€™s only room for *one* reflection.

And itâ€™s mine now.

Anyway. I think Iâ€™ll post a selfie soon.

Youâ€™re going to love it.
