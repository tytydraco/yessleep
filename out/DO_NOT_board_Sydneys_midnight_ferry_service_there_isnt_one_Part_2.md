It was a rather slow realisation as I awoke to a new day, the crushing truth that none of this had been a dream slowly dawning on me as I awoke to the sound of waves lashing against the upper floor windows. It was then that my sleepy state rapidly subsided, and I recalled every awful detail of the previous night. With the effects of last night’s alcohol consumption largely wearing off by this stage, little things began to come back to me. The first notable image which ran through my mind with renewed clarity, was the arrival of this mysterious ferry at Balmain East, near on midnight. It was clear to me now there were definitely not supposed to be any ferries running back this way at that time. And furthermore, something about the vessel didn’t look right. The ferries of Sydney Harbour have a distinct green and yellow look to them. I suppose I passed it off at the time, as it was dark and foggy, and I was more interested in getting home than anything, but I did recall being slightly taken aback at the time by the unique dark grey colouring of this one. I sat up, rubbing my eyes, intending to head outside and confirm my hazy memory, when I heard a crackle from above me…

*“Greetings passengers. The café service is now open. Please proceed to the counter in an orderly fashion, and you will be served momentarily.”*

Huh… I thought. I might actually get to speak to someone, maybe find out what the hell is going on. I glanced around, and yes, there was indeed a man behind the counter at the café. He was a rather tall individual, bald, and he wore a grey suit. Strange attire for a café worker on a commuter ferry, I thought, but then again… look where we are… I gathered myself before standing up and making my way over to the café. There were a couple of passengers ahead of me, so I stood back and waited my turn. Their behaviour seemed ever so slightly off to me, and I was reminded of the strange man last night. They were acting very similar to him, standing there nervously, shifting their weight from side to side, heads down staring at their feet. The first man made his way up to the counter, and quietly mumbled something to the attendant, before stepping back and waiting for his order. The tall man behind the counter smiled softly, before turning around and reaching into the freezer compartment, pulling out a Mrs Macs sausage roll and throwing it into the microwave. He then returned to the counter as the second customer stepped up, placing an order for a coffee and a slice of carrot cake. Café guy gave me a weird vibe. He was simultaneously the kindest man I had ever laid eyes on, smiling the sweetest of smiles as he served the customers their orders, and yet there was something ominous about his demeanour, as though secrets were hiding behind those kind eyes. Secrets I wanted in on. I snapped myself back into the present moment, as I noticed he was staring at me, and I stepped up to the counter. His expression changed as he got a good look at me, the kind smile replaced with a look of concern, and a hint of amusement.

“Hmm”, he mused. “Interesting…”

I raised an eyebrow at this, curious to know what he found so interesting about me.

“Um… excuse me, but, what’s interesting?” I asked him, not bothering to beat around the bush. He stared back at me for a moment, before shaking his head.

“Oh… sorry sir, never mind me, it’s a bit too early in the morning I suppose. What can I get you today?”

I glanced around behind me, and seeing no more customers waiting in line, I decided now was a good time to press for answers. I leaned in, lowering my voice to an almost whisper.

“Can you tell me what’s going on? I got on this ferry late last night and before I knew what was going on we were heading out to sea. Is this normal? Is there a new route I don’t know about? And what’s with the Captain? He didn’t answer when I knocked on the door and called out…”

Café guy breathed in slowly before letting out a sigh, and I stepped back, sensing a little annoyance on his part. I quickly relaxed though, as that kind smile returned.

“Sir… this is the same route this service has always taken. This is the same route it will always take. There’s no need to worry, you’ll be home soon. Now, what can I get you?”

I just stared at him, a mix of curiosity and concern present on my face. But I decided to place a molecule of faith in his words, he seemed confident that I’d be on my way back home soon enough. Don’t get me wrong, even in that moment, I was still acutely aware that something was very wrong with this ferry, but it’s amazing how far the rational side of the brain can stretch when it wants to. 

With a sigh, I spoke up. “Just a coffee thanks mate. Latte. Two shots.”

Café guy nodded, “Coming right up sir.”

I waited patiently as he prepared my coffee, humming Kumbaya to himself as he did so. He was an odd fellow, with a personality that didn’t seem to match his face. With a hiss of the coffee machine, steam pouring out of the vents, my coffee was ready, and he handed it to me with that same warm smile, never wavering. I nodded to him before turning and walking back toward the rear doors, eager to get some caffeine into my system.

Sliding open the rear doors, I stepped out onto the upper deck, walking over to the railings and resting against them as I stared out over the infinite blue expanse before me. Yep, definitely wasn’t a dream, there was no sign of land in any direction. I noticed how strangely quiet it was, and I then realised the ferry’s engine wasn’t running. We were just kind of bobbing up and down there in the water. The waves, a little calmer now, lapping up against the side of the boat. I gripped the railing a little tighter, as I noted the absence of Seagull calls, realising we must be very, very far out to sea. I felt a chill come over me as I imagined the expansive black hole beneath the ferry, the only protection from being swallowed up by it being this rickety bucket of bolts I was standing on. My grip on the railing tightened a little further as the ship subtly rocked from side to side. I sipped my coffee, trying my best to distract myself from those thoughts, and I pondered what lay ahead for me. My mind was still plagued by the possibilities as to what could be going on, still not satisfied that a hijacking was out of the question. Would we soon be approached by pirate vessels? Would we simply explode at any moment, leaving any survivors to the fate of the pacific ocean? No, that didn’t make sense, there weren’t enough of us on board to make any kind of terroristic political statement worthwhile. There was something more to this. I didn’t know what, but with every passing second the hope of actually getting home was becoming more and more of a distant pipe dream.

***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Two loud blasts from the Ferry’s blower, and the engine roared to life, an announcement over the P.A following a moment later.

*“Attention passengers, this service will be departing momentarily. The café is now closed. Please take your seats.”*

I stepped back inside, just in time to see café guy closing up shop and heading downstairs. He gave me a little wave as he left, and I hesitantly gave a half hearted wave back to him. I really wasn’t sure about this guy, and I think he knew it. Something about his non-answers earlier had my alarm bells ringing. Chugging back the last of my coffee, I threw the cup in the trash before heading downstairs to grab a seat on the front deck. I noticed my fellow passengers on the way past, all 3 of them this time. All sitting in the same row of seats. They gave me a little side eye as I walked past, one of them still chowing down on his sausage roll as he stared at me, a look of apprehension in his eyes. What the hell? Why were they so worried about my presence? Brushing it off, I pushed open the door to the deck, and made my way up to the bow, grabbing a seat in the shade provided by the upper deck. There I sat, my leg nervously bouncing up and down, as the ferry began to make a move. I wondered where we were headed this time. Norfolk Island? Auckland? Bloody Antarctica? All I could see ahead of me and out both sides was blue. It gave me the feeling of being stranded in another world. In a lot of ways I suppose I was, the underwater realm beneath me a dark, endless, alien landscape to those of us who dwell above it. I shook my head, not wanting to think about that. The ferry began to pick up speed now, and the winds blew harshly across my face. It was still cold, despite being in the middle of the summer months. I squinted my eyes and shuffled across a couple of rows where I could be at least a little shielded from the harsh sea breeze, and there I kicked back and tried my best to enjoy the ride.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

For ages we sailed, it must have been at least 3 hours at a guess, before I finally began to catch sight of land. It wasn’t long before the iconic Sydney skyline started to come back into view, and I felt at least some relief in the knowledge that we were heading in the direction of some form of normality. The vessel slowed its pace as it rounded the bend into Port Jackson and we began the scenic cruise into Sydney Harbour. Despite the strangeness, I couldn’t help but take in the beauty around me. I had lived here for many years, and I had seen these sights a million times, but they still never failed to take my breath away. My home city truly is beautiful, picture perfect beaches and stretches of crystal blue waters define the natural landscapes, intertwined with lush forest reserves, age old architecture, and the awe inspiring cityscape rising up beyond. The smell of the salty harbour air gave me something of a sense of calm as we sailed past beautiful Watson’s Bay, the Sydney Harbour National Park, Robertsons Point, the Botanical Gardens, and eventually rounding the bend into Circular Quay as the Harbour Bridge and Opera House came into view. It doesn’t matter how many times you’ve seen it, there’s still that same sense of wonder that overcomes you every time you lay eyes on it. I actually managed to crack a smile in that moment, my racing anxious mind finally slowing to a manageable pace. We were back. I was almost home.

Except… I wasn’t. It probably took me longer than I should have, but eventually it dawned on me. Where the hell was everyone? I got up from my seat and I walked around to the port side of the ferry, looking out over Circular Quay, usually packed with tourists and people going about their day by this hour, yet it was eerily empty. I could see random people, just figures, walking between various laneways and side streets in the distance, but nobody walking along the waterfront. The restaurants, normally so busy the lines are out the doors, were all closed. Even the Opera House was strangely deserted, no tourists posing for photos, no tour groups making their rounds. I wondered if perhaps it was a public holiday or something. But no… I didn’t think it was. At least, not as far as I knew. That shouldn’t account for the total lack of tourists in any case.

I continued to pace around the deck, my feet clanging against the metal as I strolled, and I gazed out all over the harbour. There were a few vessels out and about, but even the water traffic was very quiet today. Nowhere near as many boats out as there usually were. The ferry began to slow its pace now, the engine dying down to a low gurgle as we began to swing into Darling Harbour. I glanced out over the oddly still waters as we steadily drifted by the Barangaroo docks, where all this had begun. I was silently hoping perhaps we may be stopping there, but alas, it was not to be. The ferry did indeed stop, however, right there in the middle of the harbour. The vessel lurched backwards, swinging to the left slightly as it came to an abrupt halt, and I steadied myself on a nearby pole as it did. I shot glances all around, wondering what may be the cause of this sudden emergency stop. As I stood there, I began to get the strangest sensation come over me. It was nothing like the creeping dread that had been building over the last 12 hours, it was a sudden, urgent sensation, screaming at me that I was not safe. I stood frozen, clinging to that pole and staring out over the deck, into the deep, murky waters mere feet away. Suddenly, startling me out of my fixation, an announcement over the crackly P.A system…

*“Remain inside the vessel. Attention. Remain inside the vessel. For your own safety, do not go near the water. I repeat, stay away from the water”.*

I leaned back a little upon hearing that. This has gotta be a joke, right? An audible ripple on the surface startled me, and I took a step back. The water was otherwise still, what had caused that? Another barely perceptible splash, and the water began to ever so slightly bubble, right there in that one spot where the ripple had appeared. I slowly stepped back, fearing sudden movements may startle… something… One step… then another… until finally I could feel the port side doorway. I quietly slid open the door, and stepped backwards inside, before sliding it shut again. I turned around, and I froze. All three of my fellow passengers were staring at me, eyes wide with fear. Not concern this time, no, stone cold fear. I didn’t know what to do. I just stared back at them, gesturing with my hands as if to say “what?!” They all turned away as I did so, looking straight ahead, their backs rigid, their hands in their laps. I didn’t know what was going on, but I got the vibe that the expectation was to sit still and be quiet, so I quickly grabbed a seat next to the doorway and steeled myself. As I sat there in my seat, I heard things. It was barely audible at first, but grew slightly louder with each repetition. A soft banging sound, emanating from below the vessel.

***Bwoonngggg!***

It echoed throughout the cabin. I glanced outside, hoping to catch sight of something. Anything that might give me a clue as to what was going on.

***Bwoonngggg!***

There it was again, louder this time. It was as though there was something heavy floating under or around the ship, bashing into it periodically. But here’s the troubling part, it was clearly impacting a different area of the ferry each time it happened. Something was down there, intentionally slamming into us.

***Bwoonngggg!***

For many long hours, I and my fellow riders sat there, still as statues, as this… whatever it was… slammed itself into the boat over and over. Occasionally, I could feel us tipping backwards, or to the side ever so slightly, and I silently prayed that whatever was doing this did not possess the force necessary to tip this floating nightmare into the harbour where it awaited. I wanted off this ferry, but not that way. The hours ticked on by, and as night began to settle in over Sydney, our knocking menace finally left us be. I couldn’t be sure, but I could have sworn as the ferry’s engines powered up once again, I saw a clearly defined slipstream catapulting away into the dark waters in front of us. Maybe it was just my imagination, or a trick of the light, but honestly? I don’t think so…

The ferry began chugging away again, and at this point I was all but convinced I was still not getting off this thing. It had been almost 24 hours by this point. This time last night, I was still slaving away in the office, and as I thought back to that, I’d have given anything to be back there again. I glanced over at my 3 fellow travellers, still sitting there in that same row of seats, one of them with his head in his hands, shaking his head from side to side. I decided to try my luck and just talk to them, I really wasn’t sure how approachable they were, so I’d held off until now. But I wanted answers. I got up from my seat and walked on over to their side of the ship, sitting down one row behind them. I spoke up…

*“I’m just gonna ask… do any of you have any idea what’s going on?”*

They stayed silent, their eyes facing straight ahead, not moving at all. I focussed my attention on the one guy who was acting a little differently from the rest, his head still in his hands, his hands clearly shaking now…

*“Mate… please… this is clearly not normal. Whatever is happening here, it’s* ***not normal!*** *Please! I just want to know what’s happening!”*

The man lifted his head from his hands, and slowly turned around to face me. I could see his eyes were red and wet. He was quite a young man, in stark contrast to the older two beside him. He looked like he wanted to say something, but was holding back.

*“Please man… please! What’s going on?! Where is this ferry going?!”*

He quietly stared for a moment, before speaking up…

*“To the end of the line…”*

He spoke these words softly, yet with a tone of finality, before turning back around, and facing straight ahead like the rest of his group.

With a groaning creak, the ferry took a sharp left, adjusting its heading toward the Parramatta River. I sat there in a state of shock. I tried once again to get the attention of any of these guys, but with no luck. Something about the way he said what he did suggested that this “end of the line” was not a place I wanted to end up. I got up from my seat and left them be, making my way to one of the front rows of seats again, resting my head against the glass, and just… watching…

A strong wind began to pick up outside, and the ferry was swaying softly from side to side, its metal construction straining and creaking as it drifted slowly down river. As I watched out my window, I noticed things that just… didn’t make sense. Things were in their place, kind of. I had sailed down this river many times for work functions and what not, and everything I was seeing was technically where it was meant to be… But, what was there, was entirely wrong. A mass of tidal trees, right there where they should be, yet different. Gnarly were their forms, twisted and lanky. Not the beautiful green canopy I was used to, but a looming mess of spindly dead limbs which seemed to reach out for our vessel as it slowly made its way past. A few of them even scraped along the side of the ferry as we went, sending out an awful noise not unlike nails on a chalkboard. The houses which lined the river, they were different too. Gone were the beautiful brick constructed riverfront homes which lined the waters. In their place, tall cage-like constructions, their bars rattling in the fierce winds outside, and the water from the murky river lashing up and over them. As we sailed closer to them, I began to notice figures inside these cages. People… at least I think they were. Flailing around from side to side, splashing through the shallow waters of the riverbanks which these enormous cages sunk into. They waved their hands as the boat sailed by, as if trying to get somebody’s attention. I turned away from the window when we sailed close enough by them that I got a good look at their faces. They were terrifying, their expressions distorted into scowls with a burning anger deep in their eyes.

I got up from my seat, deciding to once again try to raise someone’s attention. I ran up the stairs, making my way to the entrance to the Captain’s quarters. As I got to the door, I noticed the internal privacy shield was down, and I could see inside this time. I saw only a man facing straight ahead, much like the other passengers. But this man was not nervous. He stood firm, his composure rock solid. I once again tried knocking on the door, screaming at him to open up and help me, but his focus did not break. He had one job, it seemed, to drive this ferry, and nothing was going to stop him. Defeated, I wandered back to the rear of the upper deck, taking a seat by the Portside windows. I could do nothing but sit and watch as we traversed further and further into the darkness. As we sailed, I noticed yet another strange figure. Not in the cages this time, no, just walking along the riverside, navigating around those awful trees as it made its way along. Eventually, it took a turn, walking down to the riverside. I watched as this person… or this thing… took slow steps out along a strange wooden pier, something that looked like it was built in the 50s. And there they stood.

I knew what was coming, but I didn’t want to believe it. My heart skipped a beat as the ferry swung a hard left, and began pulling in to dock at this rickety old jetty. As we pulled in closer, I could see this person’s face more clearly. It was a relatively young man, perhaps mid 30s, and he was shaking. Whether from the cold or out of fear, I did not know. I shuddered as a terrible grinding noise rang out as the ferry scraped against the old jetty. A clang from below, and I looked out to see a well built man wheeling a ramp out onto the wooden docks. It was the same guy from last night, the one I had resolved to keep clear of. But where the hell had he been?! I hadn’t seen him at all since I boarded.

***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Another two blasts from the ferry’s horn, followed by a stern voice through the P.A…

*“DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL!”*

My heart was racing. This was my chance! I looked down, watching as the young man shuffled his way across the ramp, the ferry bouncing up and down threatening to dunk it into the water at any moment. I got up from my seat, and started making my way downstairs.

*“DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL!”*

To hell with that. I picked up my pace, running down the stairs, my only goal to get the hell off this forsaken boat. I gave no thought to the strangeness outside, to this twisted otherworldly plain which awaited me, all I knew was that step one was getting myself off this thing. I broke into a sprint when I hit the bottom floor, dashing toward the doors, when suddenly…

***SMACK!***

I ran straight into the boarding passenger. I stepped back, my plight pointless now, as the gates slammed shut and the ferry began to pull away into the night. The man stared at me, his eyes wide, and clearly shot with fear. The look in his eyes as he saw me, it was like he was staring his own death in the face. It was haunting. He grabbed on to my arms suddenly, and I tried to pull away, asking him what the hell he was doing! He simply stared at me, as he gripped me tight, and asked…

*“HOW… are you here?!”*

Before I could get a single word out, he turned and ran upstairs. In shock, I just stood there for a moment, watching as “ramp guy” slammed the contraption back against the wall and stormed off to the back of the ship. Shaking myself back into the moment, I turned and I ran upstairs, following that guy… And I froze.

There he stood. Right there just beyond the top of the stairs in the aisle… just staring. He didn’t look scared anymore. No, he scared ***me***. His face, the best I can describe it is devoid. Devoid of emotion, devoid of expression… devoid of life. He was completely and totally still, staring straight ahead. Not at me, just straight ahead into thin air. I slowly approached the guy, waving my hand in front of his face. No response. I tapped his shoulder, trying to raise any sign of life. Nothing. Very carefully, I tiptoed around to the side of him, keeping my eyes locked on him at all times. I was just about to back away, when in that moment, his head snapped toward me…

***“ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?!”***

Jesus Christ! His voice was… awful! Deep and distorted, and his eyes full of sheer hatred. I stumbled back, almost toppling down the stairs. I grabbed at the rail, trying to keep my composure as I stepped backwards. As I did so, he took measured paces toward me, coming closer and closer. I turned, and I ran. Grabbing the side of the wall, I pivoted around the corner, making a beeline to the ferry’s lavatory. I could hear his footsteps, still coming down the stairs as I ripped open the bathroom door and hurled myself inside, locking the door behind me.

And there I stayed. Listening to this thing, for a human being I was now convinced it was not, knocking on the door… all throughout the [night.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Creepy__Oz/comments/1hc8ay2/my_stories_master_list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
