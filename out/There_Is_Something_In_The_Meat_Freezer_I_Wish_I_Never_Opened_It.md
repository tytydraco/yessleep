In this restaurant i have a set of rules i must follow, however the meat freezer in the back of the restaurant is a whole new ball game.

It was like any other night at this hell on earth and i was really starting to get tired of dealing with the occasional demon that wanted to appear after hours in the restaurant lobby.

Our new night cook Randy was just shutting down the grill for the night when the all too familiar ding of the drive through speaker filled my ears.

"I'm sorry we are" I began to say before being cut off by a raspy sounding young man. "Uh yeah man look i know you are about to close but if i do not get this order in my wife might just kill me" I felt for the poor guy having had a wife at home myself who did the very same thing until quite recently but uh yeah that is a story for another time but i digress.

I pressed the button on my headset and began to speak "Ok man what would you like" the man sounded like he paused for a minute before speaking "I will take a large #4 and an additional side of fries make them small"

I went to reply when the new cook Randy peered his head around the corner from the kitchen, "Hey man you're going to need to head to the freezer and grab a slab of meat i got my hands full"

I gave the total to the man and grunted as i walked back to the meat freezer in the back of the restaurant. I reached for the latch and pulled it open with some considerable force "stupid door always getting stuck" i said to myself still grunting.

I stood on my tippy toes and reached for the box on the top shelve as i did SLAM!! the sound of the freezer door slamming behind me made me jump, "hey what the, I'm still in here" i banged on the door and tried to open it slamming my body against it but no budge. "Yo anybody out there" I continued to scream.

I was just about to give up when i realized duh i have my phone. I pulled my phone out to only be met with the dreadful no service words spread across the left corner of my phone screen. "Shit now what" i said out loud before hearing the sound of voices outside the door.

"Hey anybody out there I'm in here" the door swung open as i brushed loose ice flakes off my coat that have been forming from the time spent inside the freezer. However, when i looked up i was met with a restaurant but it was one that i simply did not recognize.

The employee that stood in front of me looked even more confused as my gaze now met his. "Who are you" A tall pimple covered teen said. "My name is Rex who the hell are you" he looked at me blankly before telling me to follow him.

I walked through what i could only guess is the kitchen of the restaurant and simply asked "where are we going?" "We are going to see the manager" the kid said while keeping his head straight avoiding eye contact with me.

We approached a tall wooden door that looked like it has not been replaced in years. The boy let 3 knocks fall onto the wooden door and then turned the handle going inside motioning for me to follow him inside the poorly lit office area.

"Mr. banks" the kid said with a worried and scared tone, "Yes" a scratchy voice said from somewhere off in the corner of the dark office. "I found this man in our meat freezer he seems well he just... he's weird" the manager turned around to face me and i felt my jaw drop to the ground when i saw that his face was my face.

I tried to speak but words would just not leave my lips, "Can i help you" the look alike said as it got closer to a still shocked and scared me. "Uh uh i i was just leaving" I managed to say before turning to face the older looking door.

"Not so fast" his voice echoed in my ears as if he just spoke in a dad like tone to his 6 year old son who had just did something wrong. "Who are you" he said more softly this time, i thought about it for a second before responding "my name is James" i said with a shaky voice.

He looked at me for a second as if he did not believe me, "James huh" "Yes sir" I replied sounding more confident this time. "Okay and uh what are you doing here, still just leaving James?" He asked with a more serious tone in his voice.

"Well uh" before i finished my reply i turned back and ran for it back into the kitchen toward the meat freezer hearing my look alike not far behind.

As i approached the freezer i noticed something for the first time and it almost made me throw up everything, there on the kitchen slabs were human body parts. I gaged as i ran by the cooking fingers and freshly chopped hands and forced the freezer door open with ease.

I jumped in head first crashing into boxes of human parts. I got back to my feet as the door swung back open, it was Randy "what took you so long man guy has been waiting 5 minutes already." I looked at him still dazed from hitting my head "has it really only been 5 minutes it felt like hours."

"What hours? Are you okay" Randy asked as i rubbed my eyes "I'm fine" i replied still groggy. I went into the office still holding my head and checked the clock on the wall as i sat down 5am only 5 minutes really had past.

I took one last look at the clock before opening the desk and pulling out the all to familiar list of rules that by now i have come all to accustom too. I put the pen onto the blank spot of the paper and began to write.

Rule 6. If you walk into the meat freezer for any reason between 4am and 5am and you find your self walking out into a whole other restaurant turn around go back in and you will reappear back in your restaurant, do not explore the strange restaurant we here at Redacted Restaurant Group will no longer be responsible for your well being if you do not return.
