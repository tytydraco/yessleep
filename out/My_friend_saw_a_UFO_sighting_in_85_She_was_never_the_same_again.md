I’ve never been good with computers. This used Macbook from Goodwill has to be the first laptop I’ve ever touched in my entire life. There’s a giant scar-shaped crack across the screen, and there’s a five-second delay after every letter I type, but I don’t mind. I don’t trust any newer models anyways. Not just computers, but…well, technology in general. I guess you could call me old-fashioned, though after reading what I have to say, I think the proper words would be “justifiably paranoid.”

Sorry, I know it sounds like I’m stalling. I guess after almost forty years, I’m still working up the courage to tell this story to whoever will read it, whether they believe me or not. I couldn’t even tell my parents, or my friends, yet here I am spilling all of my secrets to potentially thousands of strangers on the internet. You gotta start somewhere, right? So…Here goes nothing. Or everything. Whatever. 

Back in 1985, I was a massive delinquent, A 21 year-old college dropout who smoked and drank any substance I could get my hands on. I guess part of me wanted desperately to be part of the hippy movement, even though I was a decade late to the party. I had no real ambition, no concrete goal for my life other than to push my body and hard as I could and see beyond this mundane existence. To me, the hardcore stuff, LSD in particular, was a gateway to see a magical side of the world that the sober mind either couldn’t compete with or access.

After I dropped out, I moved all the way out to this trailer park community in the middle of nowhere called Starshine. It occupied this little space in the Nevada State Highway, at the tail end of Route 375 (“The Extraterrestrial Highway”, for those unfamiliar), just right before the intersection at the Alamo Road. It was the type of location you’d expect to find Mormons residing up in the valleys of Utah, but instead, we had aged bikers and junkies who could miraculously hold a job for longer than 2 weeks, not that I could judge. I made my living painting people’s houses, even though I didn’t do a good job. I had a habit of mixing two different paint colors together just for fun, but my clients never seemed to mind that they didn’t exactly match. The resident I was closest with was Billy Collin, the drunkard hillbilly sheriff who rarely did his job. He was one of those happy drunks who was friendly with everyone he talked to, even the drug dealers and former inmates he was supposed to keep a close eye on. Nothing unusual happened here, and that was the way everyone liked it…until she came along.

Sherry Beckhem was an astronomer who graduated from Princeton a year ago, but she moved all the way out to Nevada to study all the alleged UFO sightings near Area 51. She was always fascinated by the concepts of other species out there in space, and potentially making contact with them for the first time, whether through a direct interaction or snapping a photo. That’s what she told me, anyway. 

I remember when Sherry first came into Starshine, with her lab coat and her black-rimmed glasses. She looked about as out of place as a poodle in a rainforest, but she made herself at home quite quickly. The stench of chewing tobacco and dogshit frying in the sun never seemed to deter her. That summer, whenever we hung out at my trailer, Sherry would go on and on about this meetup with her team and how we were gonna finally catch footage of a flying saucer with their $400 telescopes. Or, were they $500? I was too drunk or high to really pay attention. We got along suprinsingly well, even though we were fittingly from two completely different worlds. I liked to call her Sher, like the singer, but with an S instead of a C. She would share everything with me, and I wasn’t the only one. 

"Just think about the chances!" Sher would tell us. "All the atrocities we've  inflicted on each other for centuries; war, slavery, disease, genocide, and yet we still managed to get a man on the moon. Whose to say another species out there can't do the same?"

Afterwards, Starshine changed completely. Beforehand, people here couldn’t give two damns about Area 51, even though they basically lived right next door to it. Now, aliens were all they could talk about. It went from a rundown trailer park to a tourist hotspot for outsiders to travel from all over the country, or the world, just to hear about Sherry’s findings on UFOs. Hell, even Billy turned up to Shelly’s late night campfire stories, even if it was just for the extra booze. She theorized that at exactly 11:30 pm on the 21st of August, the aliens sent an armada of ships to circle around the Earth to perform reconnaissance and report back to them. To the average person, it would appear to be a regular meteor shower. She proposed getting her team together and traveling uphill to watch the sky for the night.   

So I said, “Screw it, why not?” Honestly, I just wanted an excuse to do something stupid on Friday. I couldn't afford to gamble in Vegas, and I sure as hell wasn’t crazy or stupid enough to sneak headfirst into Area 51 to see little green men. Maybe if I took some acid beforehand, I could squint my eyes and imagine a shooting star was the battleship that shot the Hindenburg out of the sky or some shit. 

The whole day, Sherry was already dressed up in her professional lab gear, except for the gold medallion she wore across her neck. It was a memento dedicated to her little sister Meadow who died from cancer at a far too young age. She wore it everywhere she went, even back in the Princeton labs. Her team came by in the late afternoon, and Sherry introduced them all to me. Most of them were fellow astronomers she met back in Princeton, so they weren't exactly thrilled to see that I was the sort of company Sherry was around on a regular basis.  

The only one I could really care to remember was this skinny guy named Alvin who resembled a real-life Shaggy, mostly because he seemed the most like an alien disguised as a human. Compared to the others, even Sherry, Alvin seemed a little too…enthusiastic to discover alien life. Almost like he had a secret probing kink that he didn’t hide very well. 

As we got acquainted with each other, we looked around to notice that Bellflower transformed over night. Suddenly, it looked more like a carnival than a trailer park. There were rides, a Ferris wheel, balloon-popping games to win t-shirts, and a whole damn house of mirrors..this had to be a prank, right? Who the hell would drive to a festival all the way out in the middle of the desert? 

"Maybe someone heard about our trip?" Alvin guessed. I didn’t know or ask who was funding all of these rides out here, but by the looks of it, they were for sure going to make their money back in one single night. There were about hundreds or thousands of tourists here who weren’t even part of the team.

"I don't mind it!" Sherry proclaimed. "Everyone should have a chance to look at the sky when the colorful armada comes, right?"

We collectively shrugged it off, and Sherry and her team hit the road to Peakaboo Peak, the closest they could get to the UFO sightings without stepping into Area 51. We just had to cross our fingers and pray that the tourists wouldn’t burn Starshine to the ground while we were gone. The whole hike uphill, I kept asking myself what the hell I was doing here. 

There was this small pond near the top of the valley with this weird, fluorescent green glowing goo. It was highly unusual just to find any trace of liquid this high up in the mountains. Of friggin’ course, Alvin dipped his fingers into the water and sucked on them to taste-test the water, which I thought was stupid as all hell for a research scientist. Even Sherry and the others were weirded out by that. How did *this guy* step even one foot through Princeton’s doors? 

"Tastes like regular mountain dew to me...y'know the regular kind." Alvin confirmed to us. The rest of the team was convinced, but I didn’t buy that. Even if it tasted mundane, he seemed to *enjoy* licking it a little too much. The puddle looked radioactive to me, but that only reinforced Sherry’s conviction that extraterrestrials were nearby, so we kept marching uphill. Of course, my other suspicion was that it was a weirdly colored chlorine that some the college kids poured just to mess with people.

Once we finally got to the top of the hill, the team started setting up their equipment. They aimed their telescopes at the sky above the general area where Area 51 would be. The facility looked like a tiny square black dot from where we were sitting. Made me almost forget that inside that place was probably hosed the aliens, spaceships, and weird plasma weapons that Sherry was looking for in the first place. 

We would be up here for about two hours, so I took a candyflip tablet of LSD and MDMA to spice things up. 50 minutes went by, then an hour, and still no aliens. While the crew were bored out of their minds, I laid on the ground smoking a joint, gazing in awe as the sky morphed into a vibrant rainbow-colored lake, like the whole world was being covered by a 70s Hippie blanket. My eyes were almost *blinded* by how bright the sky had become, even if that visual was my chemed-out brain playing tricks on me. Sherry and half of her crew looked at me with bugged out eyes like I was out of my mind, which I basically was.

"D-Did you bring any to share?" Alvin asked me. All I could do was shake my head, and he seemed pretty bummed about that. He never really struck me as a junkie, but maybe he was just feeling experimental.

Finally, after an hour and a half of stargazing, the guys finally got a reading. I saw it too, much to my surprise. The whole sky lit up with an orange glow for a split-second, then it was followed by some strange object appearing. It looked like a typical shooting star…but it was shooting downward instead of across the sky.

We looked down to follow it, but it didn’t seem to land anywhere, disappearing out of thin air once it touched the atmosphere. It seemed to align perfectly with the position on the ground where Starshine stood instead of 51…I thought it was the ganja possessing my eyes, but Sherry seemed to notice it too, jotting the details down on her research notes attached to a clipboard. Luckily, one of the members was able to capture it on camera. Those pictures could probably be worth about $10,000 bucks a piece to whichever research division would pay for them. 

Two hours in, nothing else showed up. The window for the UFOs had long come and gone. We decided to pack our stuff up and drive back down to Bellflower to check out the rides.

"I-I don't get it. There was supposed to be an entire armada in the sky, not just one brief light show?", Alvin puzzled. He seemed the most let down the lack of any real discovery.

I shrugged and threw in my two cents, umprompted. "Perhaps they saw a bunch of weirdos starting at them with giant metal dicks in their hands and got scared off." The whole team just glared at me in disgust, which made me smirk.

"Maybe we just didn't catch them on a good night." Sherry said, trying to stay optimistic about her lackluster findings. "I'm sure they'll be back."

When we got back to Starshine, the whole park was crowded, so we figured we might as well have joined the festivities to blow off some steam. Sherry got motion sick very easily, so we couldn’t go on the ferris wheel or the power tower. While walking around, I noticed something very off about the Ferris wheel. It worked fine, but the views were covered in this metal plating where a glass dome probably should’ve been. How were they supposed to see anything? I couldn’t get a good look at their faces, but when everyone got out of their seats, they just walked out without talking to each other, or exclaiming about how exciting the view was. Not even the kids looked like they were having a fun time. 

One of the booths was selling overpriced tin-foil hats, which looked a little too metallic to me. The whole festival felt like a parody, a mockery of the very same research Sherry was dedicating her life towards. I thought she would be more offended by all of this, but she didn’t seem to mind, or at least I couldn’t see it on her face. We tried out one of those water balloon games, and I won a white T-Shirt with a little green man on the front. I was pretty happy about that.  

Eventually, we settled on the Hall of Mirrors, even though those things have always freaked me out. As we wandered the hallway, we were pretty weirded out by a hundred of our reflections copying our every move. Some of the mirrors were those silly ones that made your body look more stretched out than it was. Those got a good laugh out of us. 

In the middle of the hallway, we came across this fork in the road...well, more like ten forks. The room had split off into ten narrow hallways, barely big enough for even a skinny person to fit through. We all agreeed to split up.

After I squeezed through the tight gap, I stumbled into a giant hall of mirrors. I looked behind to see my entrance replaced with another mirror, probably some fancy optical illusion the makers put in to show off their budget. When I actually look at my  reflections…they didn't have the right eye color. They were a unique mixture of red and purple, which should be impossible for any normal human being to possess. They didn’t look well-blended together, but the rest of my reflection was perfectly normal. I thought maybe the mirrors had this weird fluorescent tint on their glass? Compared to all the other effects, it seemed kind of...lame. Suddenly, all of the lights went out. Thousands of dollars probably went into this event, and they couldn't even afford decent technicians? 

Then I looked up, and the ceiling lit up with a menacing orange glow, exactly like the one we saw in the sky. Just when I was about to ask myself if this was part of the show, the whole room started spinning. All of my reflections started spinning so fast that they blended into one single multicolor-eyed image of myself. The room started shaking violently, as if there was an earthquake happening right outside the building. My head started pounding violently, and I screamed out in panic.

Out of nowhere, right when I was about to regain my balance, the spinning stopped, causing my knees to collapse to the floor. My headache was miraculously gone. I was surrounded by pitch blackness for what felt like an eternity. I cried out for Sherry, for her friends, *anybody.* Finally, the lights came back on and nearly blinded me. I stumbled out of the house, trying to stop myself from puking my guts out until I got outside.

Then I saw Sherry…she already exited the building before me.

"Sher?" I called out to her.

Sherry turned around, and her green eyes…they had turned red-purple. Her whole demeanor was…off. All that annoyingly optimistic energy was drained from her, and she stared at me with a dumbfounded look on her face as I spoke to her…like she didn’t even recognize me. I was going to ask if she was okay, but then I noticed something was missing.

"Uh, Sher? Where's...Where's Meadow's pendant?" I asked.

Sherry stayed quiet for a moment, as if she was processing what I was asking her.

“...Who’s Meadow?” She asked me.

My body just *froze* in place as my gut sank into my chest\*.\* I couldn’t speak. Couldn’t move. Damn near couldn’t breathe. I looked frantically over Sherry's shoulder and everyone walking around us had that color in their eyes too. The science team, the tourists, the residents…*everyone.* Alvin was the only one who still retained his regular blue eye color, and the only one who was just as weirded out by everything happening as I was. Without a warning, my flight-or-fight instincts kicked in and I *sprinted* far away from Sherry. 

While running, I accidentally ran into Billy. I begged him, "Billy, we gotta get out of here! There's something wrong with everyone!" When I looked up, however, his eyes were red and purple too. Just like Sherry, all he did was stare at me like I was a complete stranger, tilting his head slightly as he looked at me. Like a wolf eyeing wounded animal.

I ran as far as I could from him, from Sherry, *everyone,* jumped back to my trailer and locked myself in. Digging through my kitchen utensil drawer, I grabbed a knife that I could use to defend myself. It wasn’t exactly the sharpest object I could get my hands on, but it was the one blunt weapon I could find in my limited window of time before I locked myself in the bathroom.  

That whole night, I rocked back and forth in the corner, with my head pressed against the bathroom sink drawer, hands tightly wrapped around my ears, hitting myself in the head to force myself to wake up from this nightmare. Tears flowed through my eyes as I silently wailed with my mouth covered. I thought about shooting up my emergency stash of heroin hidden in the mirror, just so the outside world wouldn’t get to me.

Throughout the whole night, I heard rapid tapping on my door. I didn’t know if it was Sherry, Alvin, the residents, the tourists, or Barry. There was just no way in hell I was opening it. I just closed my ears tighter, trying to desperately block out the outside world, or whatever imposter had swept in and taken its place. 

Finally, after two hours, my body shut down on its own and I passed out on my bedroom floor, with the kitchen knife tightly wrapped around my fingers. The next day, I woke up at 12 pm smelling like crap, feeling woozy all over. I looked out my window, and all the rides, the attractions, the tourists…they just vanished out of thin air. The Bellflower residents were still around, but they slept soundly in their campers and RVs as if there wasn’t a loud festival last night. 

In a very out-of-character fashion, I could see Billy Collin standing near the front entrance of Starshine, keeping an eye out for any suspicious activity down the road. He didn’t even have his pistol in the holster hanging off of his belt, and he was wearing his iconic sunglasses, even though the clouds blocked the sun that day. I snuck out of my trailer crouched to my knees to stay out of his field of view.

I slowly moved  over to Sherry’s camper to check on her. It was the easiest trailer to locate in the whole park, because it was the only one with a clean white coat of paint and a clean cut field of grass. She always took pride in keeping her belongings clean and tidy, regardless of her social setting. I looked through the window, and I saw that Sherry was packing up her things. I was waiting for her to exit her trailer to properly confront her, acting like I wasn’t spying on her. 

The kitchen knife was still hidden in my jean’s back pocket, just in case Sherry still wasn't Sherry. She told me the rest of her team had apparently already left overnight, which I found very hard to believe. I asked her how she was going to continue her research by herself.

"It is concluded." She said. "I am returning home." I meant to ask if she meant going back to Massachusetts with her parents, but I just had a feeling even then she wouldn't give me a straight answer.

I noticed that when I talked to her, her eyes were *green* again. At first I was relieved, but then I saw the cold, deadpan look in her eyes, and I could just tell it still wasn’t *her.* After I got my answers, which I was far from satisfied with, I quickly left without saying a proper goodbye and ran over to my truck. 

There was only one way to confirm wether everything I saw last night was real or part of my fucked-up high, so I drove all the way back up to the Peak to see the green pond. It was such a pain in the ass to hike all the way back uphill again. When I got up to the top and I found the body of water…it wasn’t green. It wasn’t glowing. Just a dark, brownish-black shade like every natural body of water. 

I knew in the back of my mind that this just couldn’t be possible, so I dipped my fingers into the puddle and rustled the waves to see if I could make it change colors, but nothing happened. Out of desperation, I stuck my wet fingers into my mouth and sucked on them, just like Alvin did, and it just tasted like plain, untampered mineral water. 

This was all wrong and I knew it was. That green goo was the only thing out of the ordinary before everything else went to hell last night. I wasn’t high yet when I saw it glow. Everyone else with me saw it too. I just *knew* it was real. It had to be. 

A tall shadow descended over the water, and I turned around to see Sherry standing menacingly over me, like a parent catching their kid sneaking their hand into the cookie jar. She must have been tailing right behind my truck the entire time. Thoroughly startled, I fell into the pond and slowly backed away from her. I swear to God, I thought she was going to kill me right then and there.

"What are you doing here?", she asked me in an uninterested, monotone voice. I stuttered and stammered, not being able to give her a straight answer.

"I-I, uh...I-I just wanted to check to see if you...y'know, left any equipment up here!"

She slightly tilted her head while staring at me, like a hungry wolf eyeing a wounded deer. Trying to change the subject, I asked her where the rest of her team really went. To be honest, I didn’t even know why I was expecting a different response from her, but I did. She muttered only one word as an answer:

“Home.”

There was a long silence between us again. It felt like an eternity before I could muster the courage to speak.

"So, uh...c-could I get another look at those photos? Y'know...Since I'm sobered up now? Would that..Would that be okay, Sher...?"

All I got from her was a firm head shake, without breaking eye contact. 

“You know I can’t do that, Phoebe.”

This might sound horrible, but I thought about taking out my knife and stabbing her in the throat right then and there, but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. Instead of engaging with her any further, I slowly lifted myself up out of the puddle and cautiously walked back over to my truck.

The whole time I backed up and drove away, Sherry just stood there…*staring* at me. Even as I drove further and further away from Sherry, it felt like she was physically getting closer and closer even as she shrank into a little blip on my rearview mirror. As I drove back to land, I passed by more and more puddles of water that were not there before…That was the last time I ever saw Sherry, or what was left of her.

That night, I packed up all my things, hooked up my camper to the truck, and I drove as far away as I possibly could from Starshine. I spent years migrating between hotels until I finally set up shop at the one place even more isolated than Starshine: Casper, Wyoming, right around the corner from Yellowstone.

I’ve made a decent living as an anonymous artist, painting the visions I saw from my drug use and selling them to the highest bidder at auctions. It doesn’t make me lucrative amounts of cash, but it pays my bills and keeps me anonymous. Nobody at the galleries even knows my face, since I never attended them personally. I use a pseudonym for all of my work: “B.F.” Most people that look at my paintings don’t even realize that they are inspired by the nightmares I had from my experiences in Starshine.

For years, I’ve been theorizing over everything I saw back there, and what it could have possibly all meant, and there’s one concrete idea that I’ve been able to form. It’s probably not the full picture, and I’m probably way off, but this is the best that I could come up with:

You know those lifelike wax sculptures that look like the real thing, but there’s something slightly *off* about them that you can’t put your finger on? That was every single machine in this place… and every man, woman, and child that emerged out of them. That's what replaced my friend. Those rides were *never* supposed to be there. The whole Festival was a trap. At least, that's the best explanation that I can think of, not that I'm enthusiastic to get the facts straight.

After that night, I couldn’t bring myself to return to Starshine ever again. I haven't checked for any updates from the local news online, scared that I'll find out the festivals are still happening. It's unfathomable to even think about how many people have gone missing there since '85. I haven’t contacted Sherry or her family since, or any of the other members of her team for that matter. After the house of mirrors incident, I was stone cold sober, when it came to acid and LSD, at least. It was ironic, since it was probably the potent combination of LSD, MDMA, and reefer that marijuana that prevented the machine from fucking with me in the first place. I still kept smoking weed and drinking hard liquor to take the edge off, which never fully worked. 

My mind kept wandering to Sherry and her team, their families, and all of those people down in Bellflower, both the residents and the tourists. I couldn’t bear to imagine what happened to them, or where they were now. How was I supposed to look Sherry’s parents in the eye and tell them that their daughter was replaced with some imposter that doesn't even remember her own sister? Did she even go back to Massachusetts, or was she sucked back into a ship with everyone? Was anything about her ever real, or was she just a facade sent to spy on us? 

I’ve asked myself these questions on countless sleepless nights, drinking myself unconscious just to forget everything that happened, but it just keeps coming back up. I’ve lost faith in the technology and the people around me. Every cell phone, every ATM, every damn TV I come across-How do I know at least one of those isn’t an alien device in disguise? What if they all are? How much of our society have these bastards infiltrated by now? How do I know every person that passes me is the real deal? 

After I first started using my laptop and set up a website for my artwork, I received an email from an unknown contact. There wasn't any text, and even the subject line was just a single dot; just an expose of attached files. This included schematics of these weird-looking ships, x-ray photos of abnormally shaped skeletons, and a picture of the night sky Sherry's team captured that day: A single blurry streak of orange light, protruding behind a giant black object racing towards Earth. An object whose shape reassembled the house of mirrors...

There wasn't an address I could reply to. Just a single letter at the bottom...

"-A."

This single message gave me the motivation I needed to finally tell my story to the world. I’ve lived with these memories for over forty years, and it’s probably too late to save anyone, but if this story prevents at least *one* person from being abducted or replaced, then it’s worth it. I don’t even know if this is my memory. Not originally, at least. Before typing this account, I went to the bathroom to take a shower and brush my teeth. When I looked into the mirror, my reflection had a reddish-purple glow in its eyes...
