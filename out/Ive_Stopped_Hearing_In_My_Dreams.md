I've always been able to remember a lot of my dreams pretty vividly. It's nice for funny dreams that I might tell others about, but with nightmares not so much. I've gotten used to it.

Recently, though, my dreams have stopped having sound. It's not like I can see people talking but can't hear them, it's that nobody talks. My nightmares have also gotten worse, with more jumpscares that I couldn't hear coming and stuff. Looking back, I think people had been talking less in my dreams for a while before this.

I've also been having something that isn't quite a recurring dream, but more of a recurring character? It's this tall, human-looking thing, super skinny, all white, with a spyglass for a head. It shows up at some point in all my dreams, sometimes as a big part of them but sometimes in the background.

At first I thought these were weird, but nothing serious. Probably just some change in my hormones or something. I don't know anything about that stuff. Now I'm not as sure.

Night before last, my dream was darker than usual. Not in terms of gore or death or anything, just literally darker. I remember being in my house and looking for the light switch, then having the spyglass thing jump out of the darkness. Obviously I figured it was just a nightmare.

But tonight my dream was even darker. I could see my own body and nothing else. I was navigating around somewhere by touch. It was one of those dreams where you don't think about it not making sense, but you wake up and wonder how your brain came up with it.

This was all fine, except at the end of the dream I looked down and "YOU CAN'T SEE ME" was written on my arm with glittery ink. Then I woke up sweating.

It was like 1am at this point but I couldn't sleep and got up for a glass of water. When I turned on the tap, some of the water went into the sink instead of the cup (I was still half asleep I'm usually not that clumsy).

I filled up the cup and glanced down and in the sink the water hadn't gone down the drain. It had turned all sparkly and spelled out "YOU CAN'T SEE ME," just like the nightmare. I thought I must be lucid dreaming or something, so I went back to bed.

This morning I got up and it's still there. I've pinched myself and all that, so I'm awake. The words won't leave no matter how long I let water run over them. I texted a picture to my friend asking if she could see it too. She can.

I'm typing this at the library because I've been jumpy all morning and thought a change in scenery might help. My trig homework is covered in doodles of the spyglass thing and I haven't even finished the first problem.

If I were hallucinating my friend wouldn't have been able to see it, right? I'm confused and can't focus, I keep worrying about what's going to happen tonight. I hope I'll be able to see. It feels like the drawings are staring at me.

On top of all this, my headphones are broken and my music isn't playing. This assignment is due tomorrow. Fuck this, the library is so quiet it's driving me insane. I don't care if it's only 10, I'm gonna go get a drink.
