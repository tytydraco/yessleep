The night my parents went out of town, I decided to throw a party. Nothing huge—just a few friends, some music, and drinks. I figured I could clean up afterward and no one would be the wiser.

By 10 PM, the house was alive with laughter and the bass of the playlist thumping through the walls. My friends spilled into the living room, the kitchen, even upstairs where I explicitly told everyone to stay out of. But it was fun. For a while, anyway.

I was in the kitchen refilling a bowl of chips when I noticed someone standing in the corner by the pantry. It was dark over there, so I couldn't make out much—just a figure, tall and still. "Hey," I called, "you alright?"

No response. I figured it was someone who’d had too much to drink or was messing with me. I turned away to grab my phone, and when I looked back, the corner was empty. I laughed it off. Too much sugar, maybe.

Around midnight, people started leaving. A few of my closer friends stayed behind to help clean up, which I appreciated. I was wiping down the coffee table when Jenna, one of my oldest friends, grabbed my arm. "Hey," she said, her voice tight, "how many people did you invite?"

"Like, twenty," I said. "Why?"

Jenna's face went pale. "Because I just saw someone upstairs. And it wasn’t anyone I recognized."

A chill crept down my spine. "I told everyone to stay downstairs," I said, trying to sound annoyed instead of scared.

"Yeah, well, they're not listening." Jenna glanced toward the staircase. I followed her gaze, my stomach tightening when I saw the shadow of someone moving at the top of the stairs.

"Alright," I said, forcing myself to be brave. "Let’s go see who it is." Jenna looked at me like I was crazy but followed anyway.

We climbed the stairs slowly, each creak of the wood amplifying the tension. At the top, I flicked on the hallway light. Nothing. All the doors were closed, just as I’d left them.

"See?" I said, though my voice trembled. "Probably nothing."

But Jenna grabbed my arm again. "The guest room door was open before," she whispered.

My chest tightened as I reached for the doorknob. Slowly, I pushed the door open. The room was empty, except for a faint smell—like damp earth—and the window was wide open. I knew for a fact I hadn’t opened it. Jenna let out a soft gasp behind me, and I turned to see her staring at something on the floor.

Footprints. Muddy, wet footprints leading from the window to the closet.

I stepped back, my throat dry. The party, the noise, everything felt like a distant memory. Jenna grabbed my arm again, this time pulling me toward the door. "We need to leave," she whispered.

But I couldn’t move. My gaze was fixed on the closet door. It was slightly ajar, and as I stared, I swore I saw it move. A soft creak, like someone shifting their weight inside.

"Who's in there?" I croaked, my voice barely audible.

Silence.

Then, the door slammed shut.

That was enough for me. Jenna and I bolted downstairs, screaming for the others to leave. My heart was pounding so hard I could barely think. By the time we were outside, my hands were shaking too much to lock the front door. We left it. Everyone piled into their cars and took off, leaving me and Jenna standing in the driveway, staring at the dark house.

"Call the cops," she said, her voice trembling.

I did. They showed up within minutes, lights flashing, guns drawn. They searched the entire house but found nothing. No footprints, no signs of forced entry, no one hiding in the closet. The officer tried to tell me it was probably a prank, or maybe I imagined it.

But as I was locking up the house that night, I noticed something. The muddy footprints were gone. But on the mirror in my bedroom, written in smeared handprints, were the words:

"Next time, don’t look."
