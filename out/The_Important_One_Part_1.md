The first time I heard voices, I thought I was crazy and maybe I was. It didn’t start out like that though - with voices, that is. 

I was living in a shithole duplex up on the eastside. Nothing worked in that damned place, including the couple who I shared a wall with. The freezer was warm and humid and smelled like rotten meat. Half the time, the water was brown. Even the switch by the front door shorted out the first night I moved in, so I’d have to walk clear across the living room to get to a working light. I can’t tell you how many times I banged my knee on my crate of old records or slipped on a ziploc bag of hair.

Okay, I understand that might sound a bit strange, bags of hair and all, but it wasn’t just any hair. Of course, it was celebrity hair. And I didn’t get it through any nefarious means. It was all bought fair and square at various auctions up and down the eastern seaboard of the good old US of A. 

I spent everything I could spare from my shitty factory job on my collection and boy did I have it all. Once I neared a hundred samples in my collection, I went about categorizing it in shoeboxes. I had Hollywood stars like Susan Cabot and Natalie Wood. As soon as Poltergeist came out, I somehow got a hold of a few strands of Dominique Dunne’s hair. That one was a bit nefarious, I’ll admit. A buddy of mine out in California snipped it off of her in a grocery store. She barely noticed. He’s a good guy and only charged me $25. 

Anyhow I’m getting off track - that cursed duplex. Once I couldn’t get that fat landlord to fix the lights or patch the walls or do something about the rats, I finally gave up. For $100 a month, I could live in squalor. That gave me plenty of surplus to buy more hair, though owing to the rats I had to move it from the living room to the top of my bedroom closet. I could only spend time with it at bedtime. I could live with that for a time. 

About the only thing I liked about that duplex was the cool evening breezes blowing off of Lake Michigan. I’d open the window while I watched taped reruns of older shows like the Gertrude Berg Show, The Beverly Hillbillies, and My Sister Sam. The breeze would come through the moth-eaten curtains and cleared out the fetid smell of rotting food (I didn’t like doing dishes) and for the rest of the evening I could pretend I had air conditioning like those rich fuckers up in Streeterville. 

It was on just such an evening that all this started. My neighbors had taken to fighting almost nightly. Their voices were muffled by the paper thin walls my slumlord had probably put up himself, but I could tell it was getting progressively worse. This time, there were bangs and crashes amidst the yelling. Not my business, but they were interrupting my favorite episode of the Man from U.N.C.L.E (really the only episode I watched). 

I stood up to pound on the wall and I caught a slight movement from the corner of my eye on the open windowsill.  I’m surprised I saw it. The room was dark save the blue glow of the television. I went to the window to see a small, but gorged black worm fall off the sill and curl motionless on the floor below. I didn’t think much of it and didn’t clean shit around that place, so just left it. Surely, a rat would get it. 

When I returned from work the next day - wouldn’t you know it - the worm was still there and ten or so more had joined it, forming a cone-shaped slithering pile. I hadn’t even left the window open. I left them there because who really gives a shit until you’re forced to. 

That came the next day. I took my boots off at the door and came around my pawn shop recliner to take a load off and in the corner of the room behind the TV two cylindrical piles of worms had coalesced against the wall. There must’ve been a hundred of them, maybe two hundred, slimy and slithering over each other upwards. One would get to the top and then would be overtaken by another. If I hadn't known better, it looked to be getting taller as if trying to form something. 

This was too much for even me, so I scooped them up with a snow shovel and made my way to the front porch.  My neighbors were coming out at the same time. The woman, Ashley I think, came out first, her long blonde hair flowing down her shoulders. Large dark sunglasses. She went straight to their car. Brad stopped probably due to the large snow shovel I was carrying in the summer.

“Heya, Barry. What’s with the shovel?”

“Fuckin’ worms. They’re invading my house. You getting any of ‘em”

“Nah, don’t look like much though.”

I turned the shovel over the porch and the worms fell into the dirt.

“I’ve been meaning to talk to you. It’s really none of my business. I mean I’m not one to judge…”

“What is it Barry?”

“You and your old lady are fighting a lot and again it’s none of my business, it’s just it’s really loud and I can’t hear my TV, that’s all.”

Brad turned. “You’re right, it ain’t none of your business.” He stomped off the porch into the car and squealed off with Ashley. Yeah, I’m sure that was her name.

Weekend came and the worms returned overnight. I sat all day and watched them come through the window, the cracks in the molding, and even the ceiling. They were forming something, I was sure of it. First, they reformed the two cylinders climbing up to the ceiling and until they were about four feet tall and fell over by their own weight and stuck to the wall. Eventually, the cylinders connected and the worms continued up the wall to form a torso, then an upper body, and finally two arms outstretched in a cross.

Would it form a head? What would it say? I couldn’t see how because the moving, slithering body was nearing the top of the wall when a neck was formed. But then the head came, pressed against the ceiling and looking down on me though it had no eyes, only squirming wet cavities where eyes should be.

And then it spoke though it had no mouth, a booming deep voice that emanated from the walls all around me and not from the thing itself. Yet,I knew it came from it or was of it. It made no step towards me as it seemed fused to the wall. It only looked down, leering over me on my recliner. It was then I realized I had no power to move as if my brain had been completely disconnected from my body. 

*“Heya Barry. What’s with the shovel?”* it asked.

“What shovel?” I had no shovel.

*“You need to go over there.”*

“Over where?”

*“They won’t believe you.”*

“About what? What’d I do?”

*“Non est momenti unum.”*

The last one had me. I wouldn’t know what that meant until much later. And then it repeated.

*“Heya Barry. What’s with the shovel? You need to go over there. They’ll think it was you. Non est momenti unum.”*

And again and again. No matter how much I interjected, it would continue at the same speed and volume. Over and over until the words faded, to me at least, into a mesmeric tempo. A mantra, I think they call it. I faded to a deep, dreamless sleep. 

When I finally woke the next morning, it was gone - the voices and the worms. I went about my usual Sunday, cans of spam on bread, old TV shows, smell the hair in the shoeboxes. And as I did those things, the worms returned slowly rebuilding that freakishly large body in the corner. When it was complete, I was trapped in my chair and the mantra returned.

*“Heya Barry. What’s with the shovel? You need to go over there. They won’t believe you. Non est momenti unum.”*

Until I slept.
