Everyone has a birthday, the day every year we recognize the anniversary of our birth. It stands to reason, then, that we all have a “death day” too, the pre-anniversary of the day we will die. We don’t know when it is, so it’s not like there are “Death Day” cards or anything like that, but that doesn’t mean every year we don’t walk blindly past our death day, not realizing the significance.

I have a friend. Had a friend. Out of respect for the dead, let’s call her Sam. Sam was a real wild child. Ever since we were kids, there was no tree she wouldn’t climb, no dare she wouldn’t take. No impulse control. She was bold, fearless in a way that was almost pathological. If a stranger had passed through our town with a white van and free candy, this story would have ended long ago. But they didn’t and so it went on a lot longer, though not long enough. (Then again, is it ever long enough?)

Freshman year at a college I won’t name so you don’t try to track me or her–or *it*–down, she hasn’t changed. Dual major in History and Mischief. She went streaking during halftime at a football game. She showed up to class in a different costume every day for a week. At parties, once people started drinking and the Bad Idea Fairy came to visit, well… It’s a wonder she wasn’t expelled.

But she was studious too. Smart as a whip. She really dedicated herself to history and when not involved in some shenanigans that would become alma mater folklore passed on from upperclassman to freshman year after year, she’d be lost in the stacks and microfiche, nose buried in some primary source, some dusty book that hadn’t been looked at since the library first added it to their collection. I sometimes called her Dust Bunny, the way she hopped from one old book to another. 

I miss her.

One day while nosing around with a classmate, “showing them where the *good* sources are,” she stumbled across some old journals. Not academic journals, but like, *journals* journals. Primary sources junkie, you know? They were looking for information about public reactions to a certain historical event that I won’t name because again I don’t want anyone else following in her footsteps. There in its pages, she found a reference to a spell or folk legend or superstition or old wives tale, however you choose to define it, that allegedly told you the day you would die. Not the year. Just the day. 

They joked about it. Continued their research. Life moves on. But she didn’t. She brought me to the library to show me the journal entry and floated the idea of actually doing it in that, “Do you dare me?” way that people do when they know something is bad or silly but are going to do it anyway and just need to know they won’t be shunned before doing it. I am not superstitious and Sam and I had done a lot of ridiculous things together. More ridiculous than what the journal proposed. Certainly more dangerous. The thing seemed pretty tame, all things considered. So yeah. I dared her. Do I regret it? Absolutely. If I could go back in time and stop myself, would I? In a heartbeat. But some part of me knows that I should let go of the guilt. That we had no real reason to suspect it would actually work. That regardless of what I said, she would have done it anyway. That’s just who she was. A firecracker. Bright and brilliant and loud and beautiful. She lit up the world and was gone too soon.

Some logical part of me knows all that. But the head and the heart don’t talk too much.

So we did it. Like I was going to let her do it by herself. Sure, I said it was ridiculous, made fun of what we were doing the whole time. But I did it. We did it. Together.

I couldn’t have known how it would end, right? Just a dumb superstition.

We both got September 6th. We joked about how we were clearly destined to be “friends to the end.” I rationalized it as, “yeah, we did it at the same time, took the same steps at the same time, did the same things. Maybe there was even some unconscious, autonomic cooperation, like a Ouija board. Of course we got the same result.”

If she was wild before, she was above and beyond after that. No matter how bad the idea, she’d take that bet. I guess she believed the superstition, because she’d often say, “It’s cool. Today’s not my day, remember?”

And you better believe every September 6th she was as careful as Mister Glass in that movie *Unbreakable*. She’d celebrate with cake, sure, but she’d chew thoroughly, or ice cream since it would melt if a bite too big were to lodge itself in her throat, and she'd spend the whole day at home on the couch watching TV. I spent a September 6th with her once, and I saw her crawl to the bathroom so she wouldn’t slip and hit her head. She got paranoid. Told me not to come around on the 6th because “If we’re not in the same place at the same time, we probably won’t die on the same day.”

For several years it went this way. Jumping off the old bridge Memorial Day weekend? “Today’s not my day.” Doing a buck twenty on the interstate to get back to the dorms after Thanksgiving? “Today’s not my day.” Going home with a stranger on New Years? “Today’s not my day,” as though death were the only bad thing that could happen to her.

It started as a joke, I think, but the more you repeat a thing, even a lie, the more true it becomes. 

It’s why I keep telling myself it’s not my fault. Maybe one day I’ll believe it. One day I’ll say it and I’ll mean it and the pain and the guilt will go away.

It was the Fourth of July. Alcohol. Fireworks. A daredevil friend who thinks she’s invincible three hundred sixty-four days a year. It was inevitable. Nothing I could have done to stop her, right? 

Right?

The booze flowed. The drunken antics got worse and worse. Cries of “Freedom!” and “Murica!” screamed ironically and unironically, especially right before doing something dumb. Chasing an empty keg down a hill. Ball-kicking contests. Piggyback Roman candle jousts. Firing off mortars from your hand. 

I can’t even bring myself to mention what the dare was, though I will certainly never forget seeing it. “Today’s not my day!” she shouted.

“Today’s not your day,” I echoed. I was drinking too. 

“Today! Is not! My day!” she said. And then it was too late. The last words she would speak.

There was so much blood. Just… 

The nightmares I’ve had every night since then. Like a mural painted on the backs of my eyelids, waiting for me every time they shut. Sometimes, I lie awake at night because I can't bear the thought of sleep and I'm haunted by questions. If we didn't know, if we hadn't done that silly little thing, if you hadn't read that journal, would it have ended the same way? Was this horror inevitable or did we bring it on ourselves?

I rode with her in the ambulance. She wasn’t conscious, thank goodness, or I can’t even imagine the pain she’d have been in. Tried to explain to the paramedics but I was too traumatized, too drunk. Maybe adrenaline sobers you. I wouldn’t know. The horror scrambled my thoughts all over again. I’m told I kept saying, “Today’s not her day.”

She survived, but the wounds were pretty bad. ICU bad. When she didn’t come up, they called it what it was. A coma. That’s hard on anyone, but for parents looking down at their beloved child. It’s a hard thing to accept that she’s never waking up again. Never again going to smile or laugh or eat sushi or see a bad movie or complain about the light turning red right before it’s your turn through the intersection. Never again going to walk into the kitchen after a wild night with a, “Have I got a story for you.”

It takes a long time to accept a thing like that. Takes a long time to accept that no matter what you do, she’s never coming back. If healthcare weren’t so expensive in the U.S., they still probably wouldn’t have accepted it. But life goes on, and medical bills pile up, and insurance only goes so far. Especially given how avoidable the tragedy was. Ha. Only someone who never met Sam would call something like that avoidable. 

There was no way to prevent it. There was no way to stop it. No way to stop her. There was nothing I or anyone else could have done. I have to keep telling myself that.

But inevitable or not, the time had come. The bank accounts ran dry and they were staring down foreclosure. They had a hard choice to make and they made it.

They pulled the plug a year ago last night. \*We\* pulled the plug. I was there too. Of course I was. We were best friends since elementary. Her raspy breath dragging through the night, getting slower and slower with every hour. Harder and harder to hear. Harder and harder to bear. Like the same weight collapsing in on her lungs pressed down on our souls too.

She died a couple hours past midnight. Choked on her last rattling breath. 

And then she was gone. It was over. Some say that people in comas are aware of what’s going on around them but can’t respond, trapped in their own minds. Others say it’s like a dream and others still that it passes in an instant. One moment at a barbecue, the next in a hospital bed. I hope for her sake, it wasn’t the first.

Her parents knew I was in a bad way, overwhelmed with guilt. They wouldn’t leave me alone for a week. They were afraid I’d do something stupid. Something that couldn’t be undone. Her parents never blamed me. I wish I felt the same. 

She died a year ago today. 

Today’s your day, Sam. Do you blame me? Wherever you are, do you blame me or pity me?  
  
Today’s your day and I see you everywhere. I see you in the neighborhood park in the smile of ever untamed girl running wild through the playground, climbing up the side of the swing set. I hear you every time some woman shouts “Woo!” before hugging a friend or taking a shot. I see you in every expression of unbridled youthful exuberance. And when I close my eyes, I see you at the barbecue. I see you in the hospital bed. When someone drinks too fast and chokes a little, I hear your last breath. And the day has only just started. I don’t know how I’ll make it to bedtime. It’s your day, Sam, and you’re everywhere.

I did this. I got us here. Maybe directly. Maybe indirectly. Maybe because I didn’t stop you on the fourth. Maybe because for years, I enabled you. Went along with your crazy ideas. Basked in the adjacent madness rather than discouraging you. A million what ifs. It’s impossible to do the calculus of guilt or innocence. Easy to say it wasn’t my fault. Easy to say it was. Impossible to ever convince myself completely either way.

But it’s my day, too, isn’t it? September 6th was always going to be my day. Just like it was yours. I can’t help but think of all the September 6ths before this one. The ones before where we went to Mrs. Jamison’s third grade art class blissfully ignorant of our own mortality and certainly unaware of the significance of September 6th. School dances. Nothing special Tuesdays. Afternoons watching cartoons and chasing bugs and swapping novels our parents wouldn’t let us read. I think of the September 6ths after that we could have spent together, but we didn’t in case we got in a car crash, or one of us left the gas on and the house exploded. Think of the time we lost. 

I miss you, Sam. 

Gods, I miss you. I miss you every day, but especially today. Your day. Our day.

Because today is my day too.

Today is my day too.
