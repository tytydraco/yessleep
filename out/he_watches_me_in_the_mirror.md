I was never sure exactly when it began. I think it was on some forgettable Tuesday, one of those mornings when you wake up late and your coffee tastes more bitter than usual. I had been living alone for a few months, ever since Clara left. She kept our apartment—fair enough—and I moved into an old studio near the station. Small, functional, anonymous. Just how I wanted it.

At first, there was only silence. And I liked it. Her absence stung, of course, but there was a secret relief in the lack of voices, of outside noises, of unspoken demands. In silence, everything feels more under control. Safer. But silence also amplifies things.

The first time I noticed anything strange was with the bathroom mirror. It was old, with a dark wooden frame and a slight warp in the glass that subtly distorted the edges of the reflection. Nothing unusual. Except I started to notice a faint delay in the image. Very faint. If I raised my hand, for example, the reflection would do the same a blink later. At first, I thought it was paranoia. Exhaustion, maybe. But a part of me began to watch it more closely. To test it.

I raised my hand at different speeds. I blinked, I snapped my head to one side. Sometimes nothing happened. Other times, I could have sworn the reflection lagged by just a split second. An imperceptible moment to anyone distracted—but I wasn’t distracted anymore. I was waiting. As if it were a message. Or a warning.

I began to avoid the mirror. I showered with the door cracked, I brushed my teeth looking at the floor. And still, I felt watched. A motionless presence, cold, made of glass and shadow.

The days grew shorter. The sunlight didn’t seem to reach the studio floor anymore, even with the window facing west. I swapped in brighter bulbs, but everything took on a greenish tint, as if reality itself were… sickening.

One nameless night, I woke at three in the morning certain that someone had whispered my name. The voice was low, grave, and seemed to come from the bathroom. I lay frozen, my body petrified beneath clammy sheets. The bathroom door was open. I saw the mirror gleaming, even though no light was on. I didn’t go in. I stayed awake until dawn, staring at the ceiling.

At work, I started missing deadlines. Coworkers avoided my gaze. Maybe it was in my head, but there was a strange weight behind their smiles, as if they all knew something I didn’t. I was called into the manager’s office twice in one week. I said I was dealing with personal issues, which was true. But I lied when I claimed everything was under control.

Gradually, the voices grew louder. They weren’t exactly voices—more like echoes of thoughts that weren’t mine. Things I would never say. One night, while making instant noodles, I heard, clear as day, someone whisper, “She’s still here.” I spun around in a startle. No one was there. But the microwave’s reflective door showed me something I didn’t see behind me: a dark silhouette standing just out of reach.

I don’t know how I didn’t scream. I didn’t turn around. I just stared at the reflection until it died when the microwave switched off. Since then, I avoid any shiny surface. I turn off my phone’s front camera. I dim my work monitor. I ignore storefront windows with blind discipline. But I know they—or it—are still there. Waiting.

I began recording everything. A battered notebook hidden inside an old dictionary. I jot down every detail: times, sensations, temperature changes, what the voices say. It’s been my only anchor. My last tether to what I can still call reality. But even that is crumbling. The other day, I found a page written in my handwriting describing something I swear I never experienced. A planted memory. A lie that, somehow, sprouted from my own hand.

I’ve been sleeping little. With every nap, repeated dreams pull me to the same place: a mirrored room where every version of me stares back in absolute silence. Sometimes one of them smiles. A smile too exact, mechanical. As if rehearsing something it still hasn’t grasped.

Today I found the bathroom mirror covered by a dark sheet. I don’t remember putting it there. But it’s firmly taped. I didn’t dare remove it. Later, when I went to the closet for a coat, I saw—through the faint reflection in the window glass—that the sheet was moving slightly. As if breathing.

I’m writing this now because I need to record it. Because maybe tomorrow I won’t remember. Or maybe I’ll remember something else. The boundaries are blurring. I’m beginning to suspect that the mirror never reflected me—but something that watches and learns. That imitates me. That’s waiting for me to weaken enough to step out. Or to step in.

Sometimes I wonder if Clara ever really left. I have no photos of her anymore. No social media. No old messages. Only the vague memory of a soft voice, dark hair, and tired eyes. But what if she never existed? What if she was just the first version replaced?

The neighbor upstairs looked at me oddly today. He said, “You look different today.” I smiled. But I don’t remember smiling. It was automatic, as if someone else was at the controls for an instant.

The notebook is gone.

I searched every corner. The dictionary is empty. No torn pages, no marks. Nothing. As if I’d never written anything. But I remember. I remember everything.

I think I’m forgetting what my own voice sounds like. I recorded an audio yesterday. When I played it back, I recognized the words, but the tone was wrong. Firmer. More assured. As if whoever spoke knew something I didn’t.

The bathroom mirror is broken. Shattered into a thousand microscopic shards. But each fragment still reflects something. Some show angles that don’t exist. Places that aren’t here.

I’m gathering the pieces now. Each one, carefully. I need to see. I need to understand.

Maybe I already understand. Maybe I’m only pretending not to know. Maybe I’m the reflection, and the other—the one on the other side—is the real one.

Maybe it was him who wrote all this.

Maybe he’s just waiting for you to read to the end.

And now, maybe, he’s watching you too.
