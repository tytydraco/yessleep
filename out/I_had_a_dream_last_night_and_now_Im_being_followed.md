I’ve always had some trouble sleeping. Whether it be because of my sleep apnea, constantly choking myself awake, or because of my poor diet. (I can’t resist a tasty cola, often later than I should have it). 

Lately I’ve been loading up on melatonin supplements, in a small effort to put me to sleep faster. One of my friends warned me about the “melatonin fever dreams” but I’ve always looked at those as a meme, like the hat man. Fucker still owes me money… I really should’ve listened to him.

Last night, I was running through a barren wasteland. The sky was a sickly orange, the ground cracked and lifeless beneath my feet. The only sound was my ragged breathing as i choked on the iron air, and the faint crunch of dirt shifting under my weight like a beach of bones. I didn’t know where I was running to—or what I was running from—but I knew I couldn’t stop.

Then I heard it.

Low, rhythmic, rasping. It took me a moment to realize the noise it was trying to make was breathing—labored and mechanical, like air being forced through broken machinery. I turned, looking over my shoulder in an effort to pinpoint its origin and that’s when I saw him (it?).

A man, tall and gaunt, with a gas mask strapped, no, melted to his face. The mask was old, cracked, and covered in grime. One of the lenses was shattered, exposing a black, empty socket where his eye should’ve been. He didn’t move quickly, but he didn’t have to. His steps were steady, deliberate. No matter how fast I ran, he was never far behind.

I bolted wake, drenched in sweat. My heart was pounding so hard I thought a stampede was rattling against my sternum. I laughed it off at first—just a bad dream, nothing more. But when I got out of bed, something was off. My room felt… wrong. Like everything was shifted a centimeter to the left. Was the wardrobe always in that spot? The air was heavy, like it had been sucked dry of oxygen. 

I brushed it off, got ready for work, and tried to forget about the dream. But the feeling of being watched stayed with me all day.

It wasn’t until I was walking home that I saw him again.

It was subtle at first—a shadow flickering at the edge of my vision. I turned, but the sidewalk was empty. A few minutes later, I heard it: the faint, raspy breathing.

I whipped around, my heart in my throat, only to see empty air. Just a vacant street stretching into the boreal night. 

I didn’t sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw him—standing in the corner of my room, his shattered lens staring into me. I could see his shoulders rise and fall like a ventilator diaphragm in a hospital room, desperately trying to breathe life into a body that only wants to sleep.

The next day, I tried to convince myself it was stress. Maybe I was overworked, or maybe my brain was still stuck on that damn dream. My boss called me into her office to talk about my work. I looked like shit, I felt like shit and she could read my expressions like a damn billboard. 

I was out of it. As she was berating me my eyes drifted to the window behind her. My eyes going in and out of focus, failing to wet the desert my eyes had become when I felt it. His eyes. The man was out there. And I couldn’t see him, but he could see me. 

My breath hitched in my throat, and I felt the tightening barbed wire of panic tightening around my neck. My eyes darted around my boss’s head as I tried to find his hiding place. 

He was standing across the street, half-hidden behind a lamppost. Even from a distance, I could see the gas mask. The shattered lens. His gloved hands resting politely crossed in front of him, as if posing for a picture. I could feel his invisible smile beam on me through the deteriorating leather and his breathing was deep and laborious. He was almost… excited. 

I left work early and went straight home, locking every door and window. I even shoved a chair under the doorknob like a character in some cheap horror movie. But in my mind I knew deep down it didn’t matter. I took a mix of melatonin and Z-quill to try and force myself into a state that one could call sleep. 

At 3:30 AM, I woke up to the sound of breathing. 

It was louder this time, closer. My entire body froze as I scanned the room. At first, I thought I was alone. But then I saw him, standing in the corner, his head tilted slightly to one side. 

I wanted to scream, but my voice caught in my throat. He didn’t move, didn’t make a sound other than that awful, rasping breath.

When the sun came up, he was gone.

I didn’t go to work today. I couldn’t. I’ve been sitting in my apartment, every light on, staring at the door. I know he’s out there. 

I can feel him getting closer.

Here’s the worst part: I don’t think he was ever in my dream.

I think I was in his.
