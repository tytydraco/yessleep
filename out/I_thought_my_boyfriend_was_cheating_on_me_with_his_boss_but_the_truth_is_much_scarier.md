Ever since my boyfriend got his new job one month ago, he’s been acting odd, and I’ve been terrified. I don’t want to sound paranoid but he’s been out late nearly everyday. The first time he was out late, he notified me a day before. He said it was a work dinner, they would be welcoming him to the team. I thought nothing of this, but in the past few weeks he hasn’t been coming home until 10 pm on good days. On bad days he comes home at 2 am. He hasn’t even been telling me beforehand. When I ask him about it he blows me off or just says people at the office needed his help. As much as I like my free time, I also want to spend time with him too. It’s also the fact that all our conversations are dominated by this one topic, his boss.   
  
He loves to tell me about his boss. At first, it would be about how odd he thought she was. He said she had these eyes that never seemed to blink. She also had this sickeningly sweet scent to her. All the other men in the office were drooling at the thought and sight of her. At that time I laughed about it. But as he kept telling me more and more about her each and every day after work, I began to feel annoyed. Why was he almost refusing to talk about anything but that woman? Soon enough, nearly every conversation was about her, Every time I tried to steer the conversation to something else he would steer it right back to her. His descriptions of her started to morph into a disgusting admiration for her. She is so “hard working, compassionate, gorgeous”, how could I not be angry at that? I held in my anger though, maybe she really is all that.  
  
These past few days have been the worst.   
  
3 days ago, he came home around 12 am, he looked completely out of it. When I greeted him he didn’t respond. When I touched his arm he pulled away and headed straight toward the bathroom. I felt dirty after coming in contact with him. Not because I felt repulsed by him, but because there were sticky substances on my hand. I immediately rushed to wash it off, thankfully, it came off with soap. I immediately rushed to the bathroom. I stood outside of the door and yelled,   
  
“What the fuck is all over you? Come out and explain yourself!”  
  
I was expecting a reply but all I got was silence. I banged on the door over and over and kept yelling for him to explain, but nothing, just a slight buzzing sound. Was he shaving, why would he be doing that right now?   
  
After an hour or two of standing outside of the bathroom door, I sighed in frustration and went to bed. A couple minutes later, I felt his weight plop onto the bed beside me. I instantly covered my nose. There was a sweet smell. The smell was extremely sweet and almost smelled rotten. I was too irritated to say anything, so before I could vomit from the stench, I got up and moved to the couch. When I woke up from a shitty sleep at 5 am I found him gone.  
  
He didn’t come home until yesterday.   
  
As soon as I heard the front door open I ran to it. I looked at him in disgust as he was covered in the same sticky substance I felt 2 days ago. He also had the same nauseating smell attached to him.   
  
“Are you going to start explaining yourself?” I scream.  
  
No reply. I’m just met with a creepy stare, eyes unblinking, completely wide open.   
  
He started walking to our kitchen when I pushed him hard out of frustration. He stumbles back and looks at me coldly. This time his face twitched, his face scrunched together and he grinded his teeth quickly.  
  
“Answer me” I say calmly.  
  
He didn’t  reply, just continued to stare with a sour expression.  
  
“You’re cheating on me aren’t you?”  
  
Of course he is, why did I even ask.   
  
“Zzzzzzzzzzz” he buzzed.  
  
“What the fuck is wrong with you!”  
  
“Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz” he buzzed again.  
  
“You’re sick, this is all about that bitch isn’t it? Your boss?”  
  
“ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ” he buzzed in a fury, this time not stopping.  
  
My heart started racing as he picked up a knife from the counter. I stumbled back in fear and fell straight on my butt.   
  
“What are you doing?” I stuttered while crawling backwards.  
  
Crippled by fear, I could only move slowly.  
  
He didn’t say anything, he just continued buzzing, staring straight into my eyes with his eyes wide open. He was slowly inching toward me like a zombie with a knife. Suddenly, he stopped buzzing and muttered,  
  
“Don’t talk about my queen like that. You shouldn’t have said those things about her. She’s my queen and you need to back off..”  
  
In a panic, I threw the closest thing to me in his face, a flower from our vase. I immediately got up, grabbed my keys and drove to my sister’s house.  
  
Right before I ran out the house I caught a glimpse of him, he was holding the flower up to his face while grinning,  
  
“Bzzz you’re not going to get far”
