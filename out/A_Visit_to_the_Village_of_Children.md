I went on a hiking trip by myself one weekend, strolling through the forest in a mountain barely known. It was silent and peaceful. My journey was accompanied by the sound of the wind and the chirping of birds.

As I walked along a pathway, I saw a village in the distance. I could ask to buy some food and water, so I decided to go there.

I stood before the village gate and read the name: Túlku.

Whatever that meant, it somehow sounded magical to me.

The second I walked past the village gate, I immediately saw a young girl, about seven years old, running cheerfully toward me.

"Welcome to Túlku," the girl said cheerfully as she handed me a stone cup filled with greenish water.

"Oh, thank you, sweet girl," I replied politely. "What is this? Green tea?"

The little girl nodded, a bright smile on her face.

It was impolite to refuse a welcome drink from the villagers, especially if I wanted to ask for food. I gulped it down. It tasted plain—exactly like how green tea should taste.

But it didn’t taste like tea.

"Thank you," I said as I handed back the stone cup.

I looked around and saw a bunch of children passing by. They were doing activities that adults would normally do in a village. I saw a boy selling vegetables. I saw a girl buying groceries. I saw a group of children—boys and girls—working in the rice fields.

Now, that was a weird scene.

"Where are your parents?" I asked. "I'd like to ask for a favor."

"No parents," she said quickly before turning around and running back into her house.

I casually strolled around the village, and all I saw were children, doing regular activities that adults usually did in a village.

"Where are the adults?" I wondered.

"Excuse me," I said to a young boy who happened to pass by me. "Where are the adults?"

"We don't have anything like that here," he replied, calm and casual.

"He means, except for the visitors," his friend corrected him.

"What? There's no way this village is run by children," I said, half-joking.

They didn’t respond. They just looked away and continued walking.

Then, one of the boys looked back.

"Did you just arrive?"

"Yeah."

"Well, if you still want to live, then don’t walk out of the village."

"Is that a threat?" I asked angrily.

Never in my life had I received a death threat from a kid.

The village felt weird and creepy, so I decided to just leave.

As I was about to step out of the village gate, I heard someone scream behind me.

"HEY! DON'T GO OUT!"

I turned around to see a man about my age running toward me in a hurry. Now, there was an adult. But his attire looked like that of a hiker. Was he also a visitor like me?

"Are you a hiker?" I asked him.

"Yeah."

"Let's get out of here. This place is weird."

"No," he said in a panic. "We can't."

"What do you mean we can't?"

The moment I asked the question, a group of other hikers walked past us. They seemed angry.

"Watch them," the hiker who stopped me earlier said. "I warned them not to go out, but they insisted."

"Can't blame them," I thought.

The second the group of hikers walked past the gate, they suddenly clutched their necks as if something was choking them.

Slowly, they fell to the ground. Died.

I was about to run to help them, but the hiker held me back.

"This entire village is cursed," he whispered. "The entire population consists of witches practicing dark magic to keep themselves alive eternally."

"The children?" I asked.

"They’re adults."

I was stunned.

"They extract the life essence of hikers who happen to be stranded here. Over a short period of time, months, we’ll age—becoming wrinkled and old—while they stay young, appearing as children."

"How do you even know this?"

"I’ve been here for a week," the man said. "I lost my friends the same way they did." He pointed at the dying hikers by the gate.

"I've been here for a week. I observed the other hikers who were stranded here before me turned old and died, fast. I asked around, and eventually, their leader gave me the answer."

"Their leader? A kid?" I asked.

"An adult in the form of a kid. So, we have two options," the man continued. "Either we stay here, turn old, and die in two months, or we die instantly the second we step outside the village gate."

"But what causes it? Why do we die the second we step outside the village gate? Those hikers there… they just... died..." I said.

"They cast a spell on us the moment we entered the gate," the man explained. "The spell gives them the ability to extract our life essence, while also cursing us to die if we try to leave."

"No one cast any spell on me when I arrived," I insisted.

His reply sent a chill down my spine.

I should have remembered what my mother used to say when I was a kid: never accept anything from someone you just met.

"Did someone give you a greenish drink when you arrived?"
