It started as a stupid trend.

#GreenBunnyChallenge. You’ve probably seen the TikToks — someone gets a light green bunny plushie (had to be a certain pastel shade), and every time they feel “genuinely happy,” they use a dark green marker to draw a tiny line somewhere on it. The goal? See how “fulfilled” your life is by how covered the bunny becomes.

Cute, right? Harmless?

I bought mine off Etsy. He had floppy ears, black beady eyes, and a stitched smile just slightly too wide. I named him “Pep.” He sat on my desk like a grinning idiot, watching me with his empty, soft stare.

At first, it was fun. Got an email from my boss complimenting my work? One green dash on his ear. Laughed at a dumb meme? A slash on his foot. Ate ice cream without guilt? Another.

But after the first week, I started feeling weird.

Not sick. Just… aware.

Aware of Pep. Of his smile. Of how the black in his eyes seemed glossier each morning. I swear he was watching me sleep. I caught myself waking up at 3:17 AM on three separate nights — each time facing him. I hadn’t even gone to bed facing that direction.

Then came the rules. Internal rules.
I had to mark him every time I felt joy, or the happiness would rot. It would curdle inside me and grow toxic. I’d feel my chest constrict until I did it. A line. Just a line. Then I could breathe again.

I started lying to people about why my hands always smelled like marker.

I told my girlfriend it was for some journaling habit. She didn’t buy it. Said I smelled like a kindergarten art class. Said Pep’s smile was creeping her out. Said I wasn’t blinking enough.

I laughed.
Then I drew a line on Pep’s belly.
Then I laughed harder.

Somewhere in that haze of giggles, I think I cried.

The lines were multiplying faster than my moments of joy. Sometimes, I'd feel happy because I thought of adding a new mark. Recursive, mechanical joy. Was that cheating? I didn’t know. But the bunny liked it.

I started hearing scratching. Not from inside the walls — from inside Pep. Like something in there wanted out. Or in. Sometimes, I’d find him moved. Just a few inches closer. Once, I swear, he was at the foot of my bed when I woke up, marker in his tiny plush paw.

I don’t remember putting it there.
I don’t remember anything clearly anymore.

Three days ago, I looked in the mirror and saw a small, green line on my cheek.

I scrubbed it. It didn’t come off.

Now I have six.

Every time I laugh, I hear fabric tearing somewhere behind me. A soft chuckle, not mine, echoes a beat after. Lagging. Mimicking.

Pep is almost completely covered. His smile is wider now. It wasn't stitched that way before, was it?

I don't want to be happy anymore.
But today, I smiled again.

And I felt something warm press a marker to the back of my neck.

It wasn't my hand.
