The silence was the first wrong thing.

It was the third day of our five-day hike through the most remote section of the Appalachian Trail I’d ever seen. The plan was simple, the kind of simplicity city-dwellers like us craved: disconnect, breathe the pine-scented air, and forget the pixelated hellscape of our daily lives. 

There were four of us. Leo, my brother, with his meticulously researched gear and laminated maps. Ben, his best friend, a bear of a man with a laugh that echoed through valleys. Sarah, my girlfriend, whose quiet strength was the anchor of our group. And me, the amateur, just trying to keep up.

We’d been laughing that morning. Ben was complaining about the weight of his pack, Leo was correcting his posture for the tenth time, and Sarah was pointing out the way the light filtered through the canopy, painting everything in shades of emerald and gold. It was perfect. That’s what made the transition so insidious. There was no crack of thunder, no sudden chill. Just the slow, steady draining of sound.

The birds stopped singing first. I didn’t notice until they were already gone. Then the constant, whispering rustle of the wind through the leaves stilled. The buzz of insects vanished. It was as if someone had thrown a soundproof blanket over the world. We walked for another twenty minutes in that eerie quiet before Leo finally stopped, holding up a hand.

“Do you hear that?” he whispered.

“Hear what?” Ben boomed, his voice obscenely loud in the hush. “That’s the point, dude. There’s nothing to hear.”

“It’s just a quiet spot,” Sarah said, but her voice was tight, and her eyes scanned the dense undergrowth. “It happens.”

Leo unfolded his map, his brow furrowed. “According to the topography, we should be paralleling a stream. We should be able to hear it.”

We listened. Nothing.

“We must have missed a switchback,” Leo muttered, more to himself than to us. He traced a line on the plastic-coated paper with his finger. “We’ll just cut down this slope here. We’ll hit the stream and rejoin the trail.”

It was the first compromise. The trail was safety. It was known, marked, traveled. Leaving it felt like a transgression. But Leo was our guide, our human GPS. We trusted him.

The slope was steeper than it looked, a tangle of exposed roots and loose shale that slid under our boots. The trees grew closer together here, their branches intertwining like bony fingers, blocking out the sun. The air grew thick and cool, smelling of damp earth and something else, something faintly sweet and rotten.

That’s when we saw the path.

It wasn’t a game trail. It was too wide, too deliberate. It cut through the forest at a slight incline, its floor packed hard and bare of leaves, as if swept clean. It felt… older than the main trail. Primal.

“This isn’t on the map,” Leo said, a note of excitement in his voice now, the puzzlement replaced by discovery. “This could be an old logging road. A native path, even.”

“Let’s not,” Ben said, his usual bravado gone. “This place gives me the creeps. Let’s just find the stream and get back to the real trail.”

“This will lead to water,” Leo insisted. “Paths always follow water. It’s more direct.”

I looked at Sarah. She gave a slight, almost imperceptible shake of her head. But we were already off-course, and the idea of backtracking up that treacherous slope was worse than following this strange, clear path. So we took it.

The wrong path.

The silence deepened, becoming a physical pressure on my eardrums. The only sounds were the crunch of our boots on the hard-packed earth and the ragged rhythm of our own breathing. 

The trees lining the path began to change. The healthy oaks and pines gave way to gnarled, twisted hemlocks, their branches draped in witch's beard moss that hung like tattered grave-cloths. The light took on a sickly, greenish cast.

After another hour of walking, the path opened into a small clearing. And in the center of the clearing was a tree. It was a massive, ancient sycamore, its bark peeling in great white sheets. And from its lowest, thickest branch, something dangled.

It was a bundle of sticks and feathers, bound together with what looked like dried sinew. Animal bones—some small like a squirrel’s, others larger, longer—were woven into the structure. It was a crude, ugly thing, and it spun slowly in the dead air as if someone had just pushed it.

“What the hell is that?” Ben whispered.

“Some kind of folk art,” Leo said, but his voice lacked its usual authority. He moved closer, pulling out his phone to take a picture. “The locals must—”

His phone screen was a spiderweb of fractured color. He cursed, jabbing at the power button. “It’s dead. My battery was full.”

Ben checked his. “Mine too.”

A cold knot tightened in my stomach. I pulled out my own device. Black screen. Sarah’s was the same. All of them, drained in an instant. We were truly cut off.

“We need to go back. Now,” Sarah said. Her voice was low, final.

We all agreed. We turned to retrace our steps, a new, frantic energy pushing us. We walked for what felt like an hour, our pace quickening to a near-jog. The twisted hemlocks, the sickly light, the oppressive silence—it all looked the same. And then, we saw it.

The sycamore tree. The bundle of sticks and bones, still turning lazily.

We had walked in a perfect circle.

Panic, cold and sharp, began to pierce the numbness of our shock. We tried again, this time marking trees with a knife, heading in what we were sure was the opposite direction. The forest seemed to swallow our marks, the path shifting and turning back on itself. Every time, no matter which way we went, we ended up back at the clearing with the sycamore.

The sun was beginning to dip below the ridge, plunging the hollow into a deep, premature twilight. The greenish light faded to a murky gray. We were exhausted, terrified, and lost.

“We’ll make camp here,” Leo said, his voice hollow. “We have no choice. We’ll build a big fire. In the morning, with the light, we’ll find our way out.”

It was a desperate plan, but it was all we had. We set up our tents in a tight circle, our movements jerky and silent. As Ben gathered firewood from the edge of the clearing, he let out a sharp cry.

“Guys. Over here.”

He was standing near a large rock, half-hidden by ferns. At its base was a pile of stones, stacked deliberately into a cairn. And nestled among the stones was a leather-bound journal.

The cover was stiff with damp and age. Leo opened it carefully. The pages were filled with a tight, frantic script. The first entry was dated three years prior.

August 12th. Rained all day. Made poor time. Saw a strange path off the main trail. Decided to explore tomorrow.

The entries chronicled a solo hiker, a man named Alex, who had found the same path we had. His words started normally, then began to curdle.

August 13th. I can’t find the main trail. The path keeps bringing me back to this tree. There’s a thing hanging from it. It smells like rotten honey. I heard something last night. A sound like rocks grinding together.

August 14th. It’s watching me. I can feel it in the trees. It mimics sounds. Last night it used my mother’s voice, calling my name from the dark. It’s trying to learn. My electronics are dead. I am writing this by firelight. I am so cold.

August 15th. I saw it today. Just a glimpse. It was tall, too tall. Skin like bleached bark. Its joints bent the wrong way. It was behind a tree, and it tilted its head, and its face… it had no eyes. Just smooth, blank skin. It made that sound. The grinding. I think it’s laughing.

The final entry was a single sentence, scrawled across the page in a hand that was barely legible.

It doesn’t need to eat. It just likes to keep things.

Leo closed the journal. His face was ashen. None of us spoke. The theory was now a terrible, confirmed reality. We were not just lost. We were prey.

Darkness fell, absolute and suffocating. We got a fire going, the flames our only defense against the deepening night. We huddled around it, our backs to the heat, staring out into the impenetrable blackness between the trees. We didn’t speak. We just listened.

For a long time, there was only the crackle of the fire and the hammering of our own hearts. Then, it came.

Crunch.

A footstep, just outside the ring of firelight. Heavy. Deliberate.

We froze. Ben gripped his hiking axe. Leo held a burning branch like a torch.

“Hello?” Leo called out, his voice trembling.

Silence.

Then, from the darkness to our left, a voice. It was Ben’s voice. A perfect imitation.

“Hello?” it called back, but the tone was all wrong. It was flat, curious, and utterly devoid of warmth.

Ben gasped, his face a mask of horror.

“It’s okay,” the thing in the woods said, now using Sarah’s voice. “Come out here. I’m scared.”

Sarah clutched my arm, her nails digging into my skin.

“Stop it!” I screamed into the darkness.

A moment of silence, then the sound of grinding rocks. It was a low, guttural, chittering sound. It was learning, and it was amused.

The rest of the night was a slow descent into hell. It circled us, never showing itself, playing a horrific game of mimicry. It used Leo’s voice to try and lure Ben away. It used my voice to beg Sarah for help. It was probing us, learning our fears, our relationships, our vulnerabilities. We held our ground, clinging to each other, our sanity fraying into raw nerve endings.

Dawn came, not with a glorious sunrise, but with a feeble, gray light that did nothing to lift the gloom. We were hollow-eyed and trembling. The fire was embers. And that’s when we saw him.

Sitting with his back against the sycamore tree was a man. He was dressed in faded hiking gear, covered in a fine layer of moss and lichen. His skin was waxy and pale. His head was tilted back, and his mouth was open in a silent scream. It was Alex, the author of the journal. He had been there the whole time, preserved like a grotesque trophy. His eyes were gone, and in the sockets, small, pale mushrooms grew.

The sight broke the last of our resistance. We ran. We didn’t care about direction, about the path, about anything except getting away from that clearing. We crashed through the undergrowth, branches whipping at our faces, fueled by pure, animal terror.

We ran until our lungs burned and our legs gave out, collapsing in a heap by a familiar-looking stand of birch trees. We were, once again, completely lost, but we were away from that thing, away from the clearing and its grisly guardian.

It was Sarah who found it two days later. We were stumbling, dehydrated and delirious, following the course of a stream we’d finally stumbled upon, praying it would lead to civilization. She stopped, pointing a shaking finger at a tree.

Carved into the bark, fresh and raw, was a single symbol. It wasn't one of our marks. It was a crude, stick-figure of a man, with too-long limbs and a smooth, blank circle for a head.

It was him. The thing from the clearing.

It wasn't just keeping us in its territory. It was marking us. Claiming us.

We did eventually find a road. A park ranger found us half-dead from exposure and brought us to safety. We gave a garbled story about getting lost, about animal attacks. They nodded, gave us water and blankets, and wrote it off as a tragic hiking accident.

We never told them the truth. They wouldn't have believed us.

We’re back in the city now. The lights and noise are a constant, welcome assault. But I can still feel the silence of that hollow, waiting. Leo hasn’t spoken a word since we got back. Ben jumps at every sound. Sarah sleeps with the lights on.

And last night, I was taking out the trash. The alley behind my apartment was dark and quiet. And from the deep shadow between two dumpsters, I heard it. A soft, familiar sound.

It was the gentle, grinding chitter of rocks.

It’s not that we escaped. I understand that now. The journal was wrong. It doesn’t just like to keep things in its hollow.

Sometimes, it likes to let them run.
