Every year since I was born, on the morning of July 22nd, my parents have sent me to stay with my grandma for exactly two weeks. I remember asking her about it and she said it was just because she wanted to see me. I knew that she knew something, but every time I brought it up, she would brush it off quickly. 

My grandma died suddenly on July 16th this year. None of us expected it, especially my parents. I was in bed trying to sleep the night she passed, and I got up to use the bathroom. I passed my parents room and I could hear loud whispering from inside their room. I put my ear to the door and listened. 

“Well what the hell are we going to do then, Bonnie?!” My dad yell-whispered

“I don’t know” my mom replied 

My dad grumbled “there’s no way we can find anyone who will let her stay with them for two weeks.”

“I know” my mom sighed “she will just have to... stay” 

“No!” It sounded as though my dad slammed a hand down on some sort of hard surface. “We’ve gotten through this every year for 28 years. We’ve kept her away from it for 18 years. What if something goes wrong? How about we go away, huh? Just up and leave for two weeks?” 

“Honey,” my mom tutted “you know we can’t. It’s not that simple, you know that. We will just have to deal with it when it comes.” 

My dad sighed heavily and they both went quiet for a while. I stopped listening and headed back to my bedroom. I couldn’t understand why they wanted me out so badly and I sat up for hours going over what they could have meant. 

Yesterday, my parents were acting as if they were worried about something. Every time someone knocked on the door, or someone walked past our front windows, they would turn their heads quickly towards the front door. I tried to ask them about it, but they wouldn’t tell me anything. I was frustrated, and I stormed off to my room and stayed there for the rest of the night. 

This morning, I woke up and my parents were already downstairs. They were both sat in the kitchen with a cup of coffee. The bags that had formed under their eyes were deep and purple, as if neither of them had slept a wink for days. 

Again, I tried asking what was going on, but they wouldn’t tell me anything. I tried to talk to them about grandma dying, I tried to talk to them about school, and each time I got a short, distant answer. Frustrated and hurt, I went to watch tv away from them and before I knew it, the day flew by. 

By nightfall, my parents joined me in the living room and sat together on the couch. We still didn’t talk. I was half way through an episode of some series on Netflix when I looked over to my parents and they had both fell asleep. As soon as I went back to my show, someone knocked on the front door. 

Three loud knocks. I sat in my chair for a couple seconds and the three knocks came again, but this time they were louder. My parents stirred a little, but didn’t wake up, so I went to go answer it. 

When I opened it, in front of me there was a tall man dressed in a suit. His face was pale and his eyes were bloodshot and wide. His mouth was warped into a huge grin. A grin that looked far too big and shouldn’t be able to fit on his face. He kind of looked like my dad’s best friend, but he died quite a few years back and I had only seen photos of him. I looked up at him and fearfully stepped back. I was about to close the door when he spoke. 

“Trick or treat.” 

I looked at the man and laughed nervously. “Um... you’re three months early, sir.” 

The man took a small step forward and loomed over me, his voice deeper as he spoke again. “Trick. Or. Treat.” 

“Like... like I said, it’s not Halloween.” I panicked and swung the door shut, walking back to join my parents in the living room. 

I sat down tried to convince myself this guy was just wearing a really realistic mask or something. Not even a minute later, someone was pounding on the window facing me. I sat frozen in my chair as my parents jolted up from their sleep and looked at each other in what I can only describe as terror.

They both jumped to their feet and my dad picked me up off my chair by my arms, screaming at me. “Did you answer the door?!” 

I stared up at my dad, still frozen in fear and said nothing. 

“Mila, did you answer the door!?” My dad shook me by my shoulders 

“It was some weirdo!” I yelled “I think he had a mask on and he was ‘trick or treating’. I thought it was a prank.”

My dad let me go and ran over to my mom, who was staring at me wide-eyed with the most fear I’ve ever seen in someone’s eyes. “We fucking fell asleep, Bonnie! We fell asleep! Fuck! We’re supposed to let him in! Why didn’t we tell her not to answer the door? Or to wake us if someone knocked at the door?! Fuck!” My dad screamed, my mom started to cry.

“What?” I cried, desperately looking at my parents, “let him in? What do you mean?” 

Before anyone could say anything else, all the windows in the house began to shake. My dad beckoned me over as he held my sobbing mother, and we all sat on the floor in the middle of the living room, huddled together. 

The shaking went on for what felt like hours. I have no idea how long it lasted. Through the banging and shaking of the windows, my dad’s yelling and my mom’s crying, I couldn’t think straight. I had my hands over my ears but it was no use. There was far too much noise to drown out and I could feel the vibrations of the windows shaking through the floor. 

My dad screamed apologies to whatever it was that was outside, and my mom’s sobbing only got louder. My dad let go of us and stood in the middle of the room shouting, “she didn’t know. She’s just a kid, please. She didn’t know!” 

“Dad?” I wiped my face of tears. 

“Shush!” My dad pointed at me and put his finger to his lips. “Please!” He continued “please, we’ve never failed you before. She didn’t know. Please!”

I watched in horror as every lightbulb around us exploded until we were surrounded by darkness and broken glass. My dad screamed and pleaded once more before dropping to his knees and putting his head in his hands. 

Then out of nowhere, the shaking stopped. My dad picked himself up slowly, leaving my mom and I sitting on the floor and motioning for us to stay put. The house was quiet. Too quiet. The air felt hot and tight on my chest.

My dad turned to us as if to speak and the front door burst open. I could see a tall figure slowly enter the house, and once it got closer, I could see that it was the trick or treater. My dad took a few steps towards him, and despite mine and my mother’s objections, he only waved his hand back at us as if to tell us to shut up. He walked towards the man and I’ve never seen my father look so small in comparison to anyone.

He looked up at him and cupped his hands together. “Please. Please I’ll do anything, just give us another chance.” 

The man didn’t speak a single word, he simply raised his hand and slapped it down onto the back of my dad’s neck, dragging him towards my mom and I. We cried and we pleaded with him not to hurt my dad, but he charged over to us and picked my mom up the same way, dragging her away from my feeble grip. 

“No!” I screamed “please, please let them go. It’s my fault!” 

The man looked down at me, grin plastered on his face and turned away with both of my parents and walked them down to the basement door. My dad told me not to try to help them, but not to leave the house. They were forcefully led into the basement and the door was closed and locked behind them. 

The screaming lasted for hours.

I waited on the couch, too scared to move, curled up, crying, listening to my parents screaming. 

I didn’t get even a minute of sleep. How could I? 

The screaming stopped this afternoon, and I was convinced my parents were dead. I sobbed on the couch for the rest of the day until it went dark and I heard the basement door unlock and two sets of footsteps. I rushed to them to hug them but stopped dead in my tracks when I saw them. 

Both of them had grins on their faces. They were wider than a human mouth should possibly be able to stretch. I stared at them, mouth agape, and took a couple of steps away from them. 

“It’s okay, honey.” My mom said through her warped grin “mommy’s fine. We’re fine. See.” She pointed at her smile. “Happy.” 

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t. 

My dad laughed, his smile somehow seeming even bigger than before. “It’s almost time.” 

“F..for what?” I finally spat my words out 

“For trick or treating, of course!” 

The three knocks came again. 

My parents stared down at me with huge grins and wide bloodshot eyes. They simultaneously pointed to the door while keeping their eyes on me. I backed away slowly, heading towards the front door, turning the knob and opening it. The trick or treater stood there once more, his smile stretched wider than it did before and his eyes looked more bloodshot.

“Trick or treat.” 

I stood shaking at the door, staring at the man. I felt breath on the back of my neck and I turned around quickly to see my parents looking up at the man, all three of them smiling together. My parents passed me, joining the trick or treater at the door. “Treat” my dad said, letting out another laugh.

I swung the door shut quickly and bolted it. I figured that would buy me some time. The banging on the window started first.

I ran down into the basement to see if I could escape from there, but what I saw made my knees buckle from under me. Both of my parents were tied to tables, both of them with a smile cut in to their faces and multiple other wounds. Fatal wounds. Their eyes are wide and bloodshot. I have tried calling the police but I keep getting redirected, and every time, someone answers the phone laughing. They sound like my dad. 

I’m still in the basement, looking at the bodies of my parents. Whatever the fuck walked out of here and is out there with the trick or treater was not my parents.

What is going to happen to me? 

The windows have stopped shaking now.
