I had been a game warden for fifteen years and had seen my fair share of strange things in the Appalachian mountains.

It started innocently enough. I had received reports of an unusual number of deer carcasses in the area. Being the seasoned investigator that I was, I decided to check it out for myself. As I drove deeper into the woods, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The air was thick with an oppressive silence, punctuated only by the sound of my truck as it bumped along the dirt road. I soon came across a clearing where the carcasses were strewn about like discarded toys. 

The stench of death hung heavy in the air, and I could feel my stomach churn at the sight. I got out of my truck and began to inspect the deer, looking for any signs of predation or disease. But everything seemed perfectly normal, save for the sheer number of carcasses.As I turned to leave, a rustling in the bushes caught my attention. 

I drew my gun and cautiously approached the source of the noise. But what I saw made my blood run cold. Standing before me was a creature unlike anything I had ever seen before. It was humanoid in shape, but its skin was a sickly shade of white and its eyes glowed with an otherworldly light, its entire body had joints pushing against its skin, and its head looked twisted around, with an enormous, bloody mouth filled with sharp teeth running along its midsection.

In that moment, I knew I was facing something far beyond my understanding. I fired my gun, but it seemed to have little effect on the creature. It let out a bone-chilling screech and charged at me with inhuman speed.I barely had time to react as I took off behind a tree, slowing it as I started running towards my truck. 

But the creature was right on my heels, its claws scraping against the ground as it closed in. I could feel its hot breath on the back of my neck as I fumbled with the keys to my truck. Finally, I managed to unlock the door and jump inside, slamming it shut just as the creature's claws grazed the tailgate. I quickly turned the key in the ignition and floored the accelerator, leaving the clearing and the creature far behind me.

I drove for what felt like hours, my heart pounding in my chest and my mind racing with thoughts of what I had just witnessed. Eventually, I came across a ranger station and pulled up outside, my hands still shaking from the encounter. I stumbled inside and collapsed onto a chair, struggling to catch my breath. The rangers on duty looked at me in concern, but I could barely find the words to explain what had just happened. 

They offered me water and tried to calm me down, but I knew that nothing would ever be the same again.In the days and weeks that followed, I tried to make sense of what I had seen. But the more I thought about it, the less it made sense. How could a creature like that exist? And what was its fucking mouth doing on its chest?

Eventually, I heard some of the park rangers found three grizzly bear's corpses fifty feet up in a tree, with theirs skulls hanging off branches.
