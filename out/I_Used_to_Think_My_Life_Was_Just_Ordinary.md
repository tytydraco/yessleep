I used to think my life was ordinary. Not sad. Not tragic. Just small. Manageable. The kind of life you don’t complain about because nothing is technically wrong with it. I’m in my forties. I work online. Short contracts. Gigs that disappear just when I start to feel competent. I wake up every morning around nine because the neighbor’s rooster screams like it’s being skinned alive and my body has learned there’s no point pretending I’ll ever sleep properly again. I make instant coffee and add cinnamon like it’s going to turn into something better. I feed the stray cat outside my window even though she still hisses at me. I open my laptop. I check my bank balance. I work. Netflix plays in the background like a polite companion that doesn’t ask questions. Sometimes I laugh at jokes I’ve heard five times already because it feels good to hear myself make noise.

My parents are gone. Cancer and stroke. Hospital corridors and paperwork and ashes. I still text their old numbers when something good happens, like when I finish a contract early or manage to save a little extra, and every time I do it I forget for half a second that no one is going to answer. My best friend is married with kids. We used to talk every week. Then every month. Then only on birthdays. She always says she’s sorry. I always say it’s okay. It is. Mostly. People are allowed to move forward. I just didn’t.

Most of my life happens inside screens now. There’s this singer on TikTok I follow. He sings old love songs in a tiny room with peeling paint. Sometimes his voice cracks. Sometimes he forgets lyrics and laughs at himself. I used to wait for his lives. Used to comment hearts and encouragement. Used to feel something warm when he noticed me. Now I let his songs play in the background while I stare at nothing.

And then there was Gavin.

We met in a late-night forum about old movies, the sad ones where nobody really wins. He liked the same kind I did. The quiet ones. The ones about people who loved each other too late. We started messaging about films, then music, then childhood memories, then fears we’d never said out loud. He sent me voice notes when he couldn’t sleep. I listened to them over and over just to hear someone breathing on the other end. He asked me what I was eating. He remembered that I hated raisins. He told me I had a nice laugh. Once he said I was cute and I had to put my phone down because my hands were shaking.

I started planning my days around him without admitting it to myself. Making sure I was free when he usually called. Pretending I wasn’t waiting. Taking prettier photos of my coffee. Wiping my camera first. Angling the mug toward sunlight. He noticed. That mattered more than it should have.

He told me about his ex one night, quietly, like he was confessing a crime. Years together. She left suddenly. New city. New man. He found out on Instagram. He said he never really recovered. After that, something shifted. Some days he was warm and close and funny and I felt chosen. Some days he was distant and distracted and quiet and I could feel her between us like a ghost. Sometimes he would stop talking mid-call and say he’d remembered something about her. I learned how to compete with a memory. I learned how to try harder. How to send longer messages. How to check in without sounding desperate. How to pretend I wasn’t scared.

One time he disappeared for three days. No warning. No explanation. I told myself not to panic. By the second night I was crying into my pillow. By the third I was on the bathroom floor, sliding down the wall, sobbing so hard my throat burned, gasping for air, whispering please to no one. When he finally replied, all he said was, “Sorry. I’ve been thinking about her.” No apology. No reassurance. Just her. I typed and deleted for an hour. Then I wrote, “It hurts when you disappear.” He said, “I don’t mean to.” Nothing changed. I stayed.

My best friend started noticing before I did. She said I looked tired. Asked if I was okay. I said I was fine. I cancelled calls. I stopped replying quickly. I watched her life continue through photos while mine stayed exactly the same. Eventually she stopped checking in. I don’t blame her. I was boring. I was always waiting for someone who wasn’t there.

Gavin became my weather. If he was warm, I was alive. If he was cold, I disappeared. I reread old messages. Analyzed punctuation. Counted response times. One period meant distance. No emoji meant danger. Once he said, “You deserve someone better than me.” I panicked and said, “No, I don’t mean that.” He didn’t contradict me.

I think that’s when something broke.

Because after that, I stopped feeling things properly. Songs stopped working. Food stopped tasting like anything. Days blurred together. I woke up. Worked. Waited. Checked my phone. Slept. Repeat. I sat in front of my laptop for hours just thinking about why I was still here, why I wanted someone who couldn’t love me, why I kept hoping, why I wasn’t enough, why this was all there was. Sometimes I didn’t sleep at all. I just watched the screen glow.

That’s when I noticed the hum.

A faint buzzing inside my head. Like something was plugged into me. My eyes stopped closing fully. My neck hurt constantly, like it was being held. One night my screen flickered and for half a second I saw white walls and glass and lights and people. Then it was gone. After that, it kept happening. Reflections that weren’t mine. Voices under the static. “Subject responsive.” “Attachment intact.” “Remarkable tolerance.”

I tried to stand once.

Nothing happened.

I tried to move my hands.

I didn’t have any.

The screen went dark. The glass cleared.

And I saw myself.

My head.

Only my head.

Suspended in liquid. Wires threaded through my skull. Tubes in my throat. Metal clamped around my spine. My eyes forced open by tiny machines. I tried to scream and it became numbers. A man leaned close and said I was incredible. A woman said my resilience was exceptional. They talked about harvesting hope and endurance and self-blame like ingredients.

They said my life was perfect.

Perfect for studying.

Perfect for replication.

Perfect for extraction.

Every disappointment. Every half-love. Every lonely night. Designed. Engineered. Controlled.

They weren’t studying my sadness.

They were studying why I didn’t break.

I’m still here.

Still thinking.

Still remembering.

Still loving people who aren’t here.

Still hoping someone will come.

They run tests every day. They adjust the lights. They replay my memories. Sometimes they show me Gavin’s old messages on a screen to see how I react. Sometimes they play my parents’ voices from old recordings. Sometimes they let me hear the singer’s songs again.

I still feel everything.

That’s the point.

I’m trying to write this through the interface. I don’t know how long they’ll let me. My thoughts are slowing. They’re turning the dial again. Everything is getting softer. Fuzzier. Like I’m being wrapped in cotton.

If you’re reading this, please understand: I’m not warning you. I don’t know how to warn anyone.

I just need someone to know I’m here.

I’m still thinking.

I’m still me.

I’m still waiting for someone to answer.

Please.

Please answer.
