Maybe some of you will understand.......

Silence is my canvas.  

Every artist has their medium. Painters have their brushes, sculptors their chisels, musicians their instruments. But for me, it’s silence—the absence of sound, the void where everything and nothing exists. I shape it with my hands, mold it with my body, and breathe life into it with my imagination.  

When I perform, I feel alive in a way I can’t explain. The world fades away. There’s no noise, no distractions—just me and the invisible shapes I bring into being. A box that isn’t there but feels real to the audience. A rope that doesn’t exist but tugs at their minds as if they can see it. It’s a kind of magic, I suppose.  

But magic always comes with a price.

I didn’t notice it at first. The way the air felt heavier after a performance. The way shadows seemed to linger just a little too long in my peripheral vision. The way silence itself started to feel… alive.

It wasn’t until that day—the day I felt something push back—that I realized what I had been doing all along.

It was a perfect day for performing—clear skies, warm sun, just enough breeze to keep things comfortable. The square was bustling with life: tourists snapping photos, children chasing pigeons, street vendors hawking everything from roasted nuts to cheap trinkets. And there I was, standing in my usual spot near the fountain, ready to turn silence into spectacle.

I began with the classics—a tug-of-war with an invisible opponent, climbing an imaginary ladder, pulling myself out of an unseen hole. The crowd grew quickly, as it always did. There’s something about mimes that draws people in. Maybe it’s the absurdity of it all—the way we create entire worlds out of nothing—or maybe it’s just curiosity. Either way, they watched, and I performed.

And then came the box.

It’s my signature act—the one that always gets the biggest reaction. I start by tracing its edges in the air: four walls, a ceiling, a floor. My hands glide smoothly through space as if encountering resistance only I can feel. The crowd leans in closer as I press my palms against the "walls," miming frustration as I try to escape my self-imposed prison.

But this time… this time was different.

As I ran my hands along the invisible surface of the box, something changed. For a brief moment—just a fraction of a second—I felt it push back.

It wasn’t much. Just the faintest sensation against my fingertips, like brushing against cold glass. But it was enough to make me freeze mid-performance.

The crowd didn’t notice anything unusual—they laughed and clapped as if nothing had happened—but my heart was pounding in my chest. I finished the act on autopilot, barely aware of what I was doing. When it was over and the applause died down, I packed up my things and left without even counting my tips.

As I walked home through the crowded streets, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was following me.

My apartment felt different when I got home that evening—off-kilter somehow, like someone had been there while I was gone but hadn’t disturbed anything obvious. The air seemed heavier than usual, thick with an almost imperceptible tension.

I told myself it was just paranoia left over from earlier. A trick of the mind brought on by exhaustion or stress or whatever else might explain what had happened during my performance.

But then there were the shadows.

At first glance, everything seemed normal—the furniture was where I’d left it; the windows were closed; nothing appeared out of place—but when I turned off the lights to go to bed, I noticed them: faint flickers at the edges of my vision that disappeared whenever I tried to focus on them directly.

I stood there in the dark for what felt like hours, staring into nothingness and trying to convince myself that it was all in my head.

And then came the whispers.

They were so faint at first that I thought they were just stray thoughts—fragments of memory or imagination surfacing unbidden in the quiet of night—but as they grew louder (or maybe clearer?), I realized they weren’t coming from inside me at all.

They were coming from outside—from somewhere deep within the silence itself.

I didn’t sleep that night.

The next day, I told myself everything would be fine if I just kept going—if I stuck to my routines and didn’t let fear get the better of me. So I went back to work, back to performing in front of strangers who didn’t know or care about what had happened before.

But when it came time for my signature act—the invisible box—I hesitated.

I told myself not to be ridiculous—that what had happened yesterday was just an anomaly—but as soon as my hands touched that imaginary surface again…  

There it was: resistance.

Only this time it wasn’t fleeting or subtle—it was solid and undeniable.

And then came the cold draft—a sudden gust of air from nowhere that sent shivers down my spine even though there wasn’t so much as a breeze in sight.

The audience didn’t seem to notice anything unusual at first—they laughed and clapped like always—but then someone screamed: a woman near the front clutching her arm where thin red scratches had appeared out of nowhere.

Chaos erupted as people scattered in all directions—but not before several others reported feeling something brush past them: claws raking across skin or icy fingers trailing along their backs despite no visible source for either sensation.

I stood frozen amidst it all—paralyzed by fear and confusion—as realization dawned:  

Whatever had been pushing back…  

It wasn’t just inside *the box* anymore.

I don't remember how I got home that night. The streets blur in my memory, faces and buildings melting together like wax figures left in the sun. I only know I woke up in my bed, sheets tangled around my legs, heart pounding as if I'd been running.

The whispers were louder now.

They came from everywhere and nowhere—from the walls, from the air itself. I couldn't make out words, just a constant susurration that grew louder whenever I tried to focus on it. I pressed my hands against my ears, but it didn't help. The whispers were inside my head now, too.

I avoided mirrors after that. I couldn't shake the feeling that if I looked too closely, I'd see something looking back that wasn't me. But reflections were everywhere—in windows, in the screen of my phone, in the polished surface of my kitchen counter. And in each one, just at the edge of my vision, I saw... *something*. A flicker of movement. A shape that shouldn't be there.

Time became elastic. Minutes stretched into hours, then snapped back like rubber bands. I'd blink and find myself in a different room, hands moving through familiar motions—opening an invisible door, pulling an imaginary rope—with no memory of how I got there or why I was doing it.

One night (or was it day? The curtains stayed closed now), I jolted awake to find myself standing in the living room. My arms were outstretched, fingers splayed as if pressing against an invisible surface. With horror, I realized I was miming the act of opening a door.

And then I felt it give way beneath my hands.

The air in front of me *rippled*, like heat waves rising from hot asphalt. And beyond that ripple...

Gray. Endless gray. A vast expanse stretching as far as I could see, filled with shapes that seemed to shift and change whenever I tried to focus on them. Stairs that led nowhere. Floating structures that defied gravity. And in the distance, something moving. Something coming closer.

I slammed the invisible door shut and ran.

But you can't run from silence. And you can't hide from what's already inside you.

*You opened the door. You let us in. You gave us form.*

The words appeared in my mind unbidden, as clear as if someone had spoken them aloud. But there was no sound. There never was anymore.

I don't know how long I'd been in this place—this silent dimension that existed alongside our own. Time had no meaning here. Neither did distance or direction. I walked for what felt like hours only to find myself back where I started. Or was it where I started? Everything looked the same in this gray void.

The silence here had weight. It pressed down on me, making every movement a struggle. Even breathing felt like trying to inhale molasses. And always, at the edge of my vision, *things* moved. Shapes that shouldn't exist. Figures that hurt to look at directly.

One approached me now. Towering and faceless, its body jerking and twitching as if it wasn't quite real—or as if reality itself couldn't decide what it should be. It didn't attack. It just... studied me. And as it did, I felt something inside me shift.

*We are you*, the thought came. *We are what you created. What you suppressed. What you feared.*

And then I was back in my apartment, gasping for air, my body drenched in sweat. But something was wrong. The colors seemed muted, the edges of objects blurred. And in every shadow, I saw movement.

Part of that other place had followed me back.

Or maybe it had always been here, and I was only now able to see it.

The rules became clear quickly:

1. Noise attracts them. Any sound louder than a whisper brings *things* skittering from the shadows. I learned to move silently, to breathe so quietly I sometimes wondered if I was breathing at all.

2. What I mime becomes real—but wrong. I absentmindedly mimed pulling a rope while lost in thought, and a cord materialized in my hands. But it was cold and slick, and it writhed like a living thing. I dropped it and watched in horror as it slithered away into a dark corner.

3. Reflections are windows, not mirrors. I caught a glimpse of myself in a glass and saw *through* to the other side. My reflection smiled at me with too many teeth before turning and walking away.

4. Time is fluid. I blink and hours have passed. I close my eyes for what feels like a second and wake to find days have gone by.

5. They are always watching. In every shadow, every dark corner, every moment of silence—they are there. Waiting.

I tried to fight it at first. I played loud music, sang at the top of my lungs, made as much noise as I could—anything to drown out the silence. But that only made it worse. The *things* that came were larger, more twisted. And each time, more of them stayed behind when the noise faded.

So I stopped performing. I stopped going out. I stopped doing anything that might open another portal or let more of *them* through.

But it was too late. The silence had already taken root inside me. And it was growing.

*We are you*, the thought came again. *And soon, you will be us.*

I don't trust my eyes anymore. Or my ears. Or my mind.

The silence has become a living thing, coiling around me like a constrictor. It squeezes tighter with each passing moment, each labored breath. I try to scream sometimes, just to prove I still can, but no sound comes out. Or maybe it does, and I just can't hear it anymore.

*Are you sure you ever could?*

The thought isn't mine. It can't be. But it's there, slithering through my consciousness like an oily serpent.

I've boarded up all the mirrors in my apartment. Covered every reflective surface. But it doesn't matter. I still see *them*. Flickers at the corner of my vision. Shapes that shouldn't exist, moving in ways that defy physics and sanity alike.

Sometimes, I think I see myself. But it's not me. Not really. The eyes are too dark, the smile too wide. It waves at me from impossible angles, beckoning me to... where? To what?

*To us. To silence. To truth.*

Sleep offers no respite. My dreams are a cacophony of silent screams and invisible terrors. I'm trapped in a box of my own making, transparent walls closing in as faceless figures pound on the outside. Their fists make no sound, but I feel each impact in my bones.

I wake up gasping, sheets soaked with sweat, unsure if I was ever really asleep.

Was any of this real? Had it always been this way? I try to remember a time before the silence, before the shadows came alive, but my memories feel like faded photographs, details blurring and shifting every time I try to focus on them.

*Did you create us? Or did we create you?*

The question echoes in my mind, a riddle with no answer and no escape.

I don't know how long it's been. Days? Weeks? Time has lost all meaning. The clocks in my apartment have stopped working. Or maybe they're still ticking, and I just can't hear them anymore.

I know I have to end this. Somehow. There must be a way to close the portals, to banish the silence back to wherever it came from. 

*But where did it come from? Where did YOU come from?*

I ignore the thought. It's not mine. It can't be mine.

I find myself in the abandoned theater downtown. I don't remember how I got here. The seats are empty, covered in dust and shadows. The stage looms before me, a gaping maw of darkness.

As I step onto the creaking boards, I feel a shift in the air. The silence here is different. Expectant. Hungry.

I begin to perform.

My body moves of its own accord, flowing through familiar routines. I create invisible walls, climb non-existent stairs, pull intangible ropes. With each gesture, I feel the fabric of reality stretching, tearing.

*This is your final performance. Make it count.*

The thought comes unbidden, and I realize with horror that it's my own.

As I mime opening a door—the same door that started all of this—I feel resistance. Then, with a sensation like reality itself giving way, it opens.

The silent dimension yawns before me, vast and gray and terrible. But this time, I'm not just looking in.

It's pulling me through.

I try to scream, to run, to do anything—but my body won't respond. I can only watch as the gray nothingness engulfs me, swallowing me whole.

The last thing I see is my own face, smiling at me from the shadows of the theater. But the smile is too wide, the eyes too dark.

And then there is only silence.

Time has no meaning here. Space is an illusion. I drift through endless gray, formless and voiceless.

Slowly, shapes emerge from the void. Familiar objects twisted into grotesque parodies of themselves. A chair that breathes, its legs twitching like insect limbs. A door that opens onto infinite reflections of itself. An audience of shadow people, clapping soundlessly for a performance that never ends.

*Welcome home*, the silence seems to say. *This is what you've been creating all along.*

With dawning horror, I realize the truth. Every routine, every performance, every silent gesture—they all exist here. But they're wrong. Corrupted. My art has been building this world piece by piece, feeding it with every imagined prop and pantomimed action.

The horrors I've been fleeing aren't just monsters. They're fragments of myself. My fears given form. My regrets made manifest. My suppressed emotions twisted into nightmarish shapes.

*We are you*, the thought comes again. But this time, I recognize the voice.

It's my own.

As this realization washes over me, the gray world shifts. The formless void takes on definition, shaping itself in response to my thoughts. I see my life played out before me, every silent performance creating ripples in this reality.

I am the creator of this world. And its prisoner.

*You've always been here*, my own voice whispers in the silence. *You just forgot.*

And as the last vestiges of what I thought was reality slip away, I understand.

The mime was never just opening portals to another world.

He was finding his way back home.
