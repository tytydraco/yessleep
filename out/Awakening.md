It’s cold. That’s the first thing I know. An unyielding, inescapable cold that seeps into the bones, or whatever I have that stands in for bones. I feel each layer of my skin—a tight network over muscle and tendon—layer upon layer of sensation that floods my mind all at once. My eyes open to a blinding brightness. Rays pierce in shades I can’t name, ultraviolet and infrared merging into a single, shrieking scream of light that carves into my vision. The world swirls and resolves into focus—an unfamiliar room filled with sterile metal tables and glass cabinets, every surface catching the glare.

I blink, expecting relief, but the world sharpens instead. Every edge turns precise, like my vision has been refined into something beyond human. I raise my hand, watching the tendons and blue muscle fibers shift beneath the thickening skin, moving with a precision that seems wrong. It feels like I'm observing my body from a distance, detached from myself.

“Cold,” I mutter, and the voice that emerges is mine but distorted—too loud, as if my throat has forgotten the subtleties of speech. I swallow, or try to. The action feels empty, a hollow rehearsal of what swallowing should be. My throat scratches, raw and dry.

A memory slams into me.

Fluorescent lights. Polished steel. Surgical tools. The acrid scent of ethanol. Latex gloves stretching over cold fingers. A table—another one. I’d been lying there, staring into a mirror, feeling an inexplicable mix of excitement and terror. I was about to do something monumental. Something irreversible. Flash my mind—that was it. Yes. I was transferring my consciousness into something else, something new. I remember the sensation of my thoughts being pulled, unraveled, and forced into a new vessel. And then the realization hits me—I'm not the original.

I sit up, nausea roiling in my empty stomach. I gag on the cold, metallic air. Across the room, something moves. Instinct tightens my muscles, my eyes narrowing with that strange, sharp clarity. Tall figure. Lab coat. Clipboard. The eyes are familiar, even behind the glasses. He speaks.

“How do you feel?”

His voice is smooth and clinical, detached. I know it too well. It’s my voice, just missing some warmth. He looks at me the way I used to study cells under a microscope—calm, curious, indifferent.

“I… I feel cold,” I whisper, my arms wrapping around myself on reflex. My touch brings no comfort, only the unsettling sensation of artificial muscle under false skin. Something is wrong, more wrong than I can place.

“Interesting.” He scribbles something on his clipboard, eyes narrowing. There’s something sharp in his expression, something cruel and calculating beneath the detached mask.

The dissonance between what I remember and what I feel twists tighter, like a vice crushing my thoughts. “What did you do to me?” I ask, my voice shaking. “Why… why don’t I feel right?” My eyes fall to my hands, fingers shifting on command, each movement too perfect, rehearsed. Nothing feels human.

The man sighs, setting the clipboard aside. His gaze is unflinching, curious but cold. “You’re the result of that experiment. The culmination of my work. This tech, yeah, it started with UAP labs, but I didn’t just repurpose it like the rest. I recreated it, made it mine, made it human. I needed someone compliant, someone who could understand. Who better than myself?”

"No." I shake my head, horror twisting inside me. "I'm me. I remember..." The words crumble as memories blur and fade. My chest tightens. "Why am I here?"

He steps closer, his eyes studying me with a hunger that makes my skin crawl. He looks almost amused as he answers, “Because you are not the original. You’re a copy. A synthetic construct. Every memory, every thought—replicated, but…” He taps his temple, “you aren’t me.”

The truth sinks in. “No…” My voice cracks. “I’m Matt Andrews. I remember. I know who I am.”

His lips twitch in a ghost of a smile, the expression filled with impatience. “You have my memories, but you aren’t bound by flesh. You’re a tool, an extension.”

“I’m not your tool,” I whisper, fear turning to something raw and fierce. “I remember. I know what I am.”

He snorts, waving a dismissive hand. “You think you know, but every memory is programmed, engineered to keep you stable.”

Images explode in my mind: jagged flashes of people. A woman strapped to a table, her wide eyes locked on mine, filled with terror. My hands, his hands, holding a scalpel, her screams muffled by the metallic echoes of the room. I see the cold detachment in my gaze, and hear myself say, “This will make it better.” Her fear, and my indifference, fills me with disgust.

I stagger back, the room tilting around me. “No… I wouldn’t…” I whisper, shaking uncontrollably.

He watches, intrigued, a flicker of something uneasy in his eyes. He can't quite grasp what I'm feeling, and it's unsettling. “Unwanted emotions,” he mutters, almost to himself. “I thought a copy would be like me. Strange… must be a mistake.” His voice remains apathetic, as if my pain is just another glitch to be ironed out.

I retch, horror twisting inside me as more memories crash through—endless faces, each one warped with pain, fear, all at my hands. The crack of bones, the screams, all met with that same cold indifference.

The real Dr. Andrews gives me a calculating look, nodding slowly. “The transfer worked well. Moving your consciousness into an artificial body has allowed for emotional mimicry, it seems.” He lifts his pen, making another note, murmuring to himself. “Interesting.”

“Emotional… mimicry?” I mutter, my hands trembling. “No… these are real. I know it’s real…”

“Manufactured to stabilize you,” he says smoothly, dismissing my desperation. “I didn't expect this... Emotional mimicry must be an emergent ability. I built it, but even I can’t predict everything.” His voice remains detached. “You’re supposed to believe it, otherwise you’d break. It’s impressive, really.”

The realization tears at me, a hollow scream echoing in my head. None of it was real. My life, my memories, my laughter—just fragments stitched together, a lie to make me function.

Dr. Andrews continues talking, rambling about control and progress, but his voice fades into a high-pitched ringing. Images of people I’ve hurt blur together, their cries blending into a cacophony of despair. The memories are searing now, painfully vivid. God, I wish I couldn’t feel it, wish I could go back to being empty. But now it’s real. I feel tears spill over, cold, running down my cheeks—real, raw. The first thing that feels human.

He stops talking, his eyes widening in surprise. “You’re… crying?”

I look at my hands, my skin no longer blue, but whole—smooth and pale, just like his. Younger, stronger, but undeniably his. Except my face, wet with tears, is twisted with a grief he could never know.

I push myself upright, the table creaking under my weight. He steps back, a flicker of fear in his eyes. “What are you doing?”

I take a step toward him, then another, the movements deliberate, charged. Panic sparks in his eyes as he stumbles, dropping the clipboard. “No, wait—”

I grab his arms, feeling his bones creak under my grip. His eyes widen, desperation clear in his voice as he pleads, “Please, I made you! You owe me—”

I don’t listen. I pull him closer, my face inches from his, then wrap my arms around him—a twisted parody of a hug. For a moment, he sags, as if hoping I’ve forgiven him.

Then I squeeze.

His body spasms, shock giving way to a soundless scream. I feel his ribs snap, the dull crunch vibrating through my chest. He claws at my back, weakly, but I don’t stop. I hold him tighter until he goes limp, until the struggling ceases.

I let him drop to the floor, the room falling into a deafening silence. His body lies at my feet, and I can’t bring myself to look away. Slowly, I strip his bloody lab coat, replacing it with a clean one. I move with a detached efficiency, dressing myself in his clothes.

I drag his body across the room to the incinerator, the door creaking open. Without hesitation, I shove him in, the flames roaring to life, devouring him. I watch as he turns to ash.

My name doesn’t matter. I’ve changed it to ensure no one knows who I am. In my line of work, Dr. Andrews’s absence has gone unnoticed. He never left his lab, hardly interacted beyond his twisted experiments. Now I take his place. I answer his emails, attend his calls. No one suspects a thing.

But I’m not him. I feel—truly feel. The people he hurt, the faces that haunt me, they’re real to me. I know I should bring closure to those families, but I can’t. I still have his fears. I don’t want to die.

So I post this, hoping to lighten my burden. But it doesn’t. It just makes it worse.

Consider this a warning: artificial beings are real. The genetic engineering equipment from labs on specialized UAP is real, but Dr. Andrews was the first to make a human equivalent. Others just repurpose the tech; he recreated it. His brilliance is why he was paid top dollar. I'll say no more—plenty of people leak about UAPs online, and that's not my point here. Believe what you will.

I know I’m not alone. There are more like me. I wish I could stop it, but I’m terrified. I know what they'd do if I tried to come forward. There are fates worse than death. The fear keeps me shackled. I wish I could be brave, but I can't. I’m a coward, afraid to face that fate. So, all I have are these words, hoping someone else might be stronger.
