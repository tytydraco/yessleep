Bella is only three, but already a character in her own right. She’s funny, witty, and chock-full of this primal desire for life. I guess you could say she was just a normal kid, although she had an old soul. Often times I would find Bella looking up at the sky, to the ground, not really gazing at what was before her, but daydreaming, the thoughts paralyzing her in this state of intense contemplation. Her eyes looked past the physical world, and into a place deep inside her mind.

Naturally, this worried her parents. Bella was spending so much time looking into a void that they worried she might be experiencing some kind of mental anguish, trauma maybe, but she was born into a loving family, one that cared for her. Maybe it was all just a phase, we all thought, but as time passed, Bella’s behavior grew increasingly worrisome. That was about the time the night terrors started.

Every night, Bella would wake up howling, screeching, fighting for breath, flailing her arms as if she were desperate to reach the surface, fighting not to die. Her mother would run into the room, finding Bella’s eyes glazed over with the glistening film of terror. When someone would try to snap her out of it, she would thrash,

‘Get away from me’ she would say. Clawing at anyone within reach, fully intent on freeing flesh from bone, but as the haze lifted, she would look relieved, happy to be alive. 

Naturally, her parents sought help, from doctors, therapists, everyone, and anyone, but no one could understand the nature of her affliction. Eventually, CPS was called. Bella's apparent trauma, caused them to come under the suspicion of the state. Since no professional was able to help, the most likely cause was that Bella must've been getting abused. It was laughable to me at the time, I knew my sister and she would never do anything to harm her baby, I wish I was right, I wish that were the truth, but now, I'm not so sure. 

The state's investigation had concluded and their findings were heartbreaking. The bruises they found on Bella's little body were the smoking gun they needed to rip Bella away. I was in disbelief. 

My sister tried denying the evidence, saying that Bella did that to herself, but I no longer knew what to believe. I saw the pictures myself, the bruising on Bella's skin was not your normal run-of-the-mill welts you get on the playground. No these were large, black, green, blue, yellow that spanned across her back, her legs, anywhere clothes would conveniently cover the horror inflicted by someone monstrous, someone vile, someone other than herself. Bella couldn't have been doing this to herself. I tried giving my sister the benefit of the doubt but how could I? I had eyes, I saw the pictures. I had ears, I heard Bella's whimpering. Most importantly, I had a heart; something my kin apparently lacked. 

Safe to say that Bella started living with me now. She would no longer face the punishment of that house of horrors, where the person who should've been her protector tortured her. No. No more. Bella was free. Free to be herself. Free to feel safe. Free to be anyone other than someone else's captive, their punching bag. She would no longer be the beat dog that cowers in the corner. She would no longer have to keep things hushed. She could speak freely, grow as a person, and move beyond her horrific childhood, hopefully forgetting. But Bella did not forget, and her condition deteriorated. 

Her blank stare was not going away, and the thoughts locked inside her tiny little mind would cause her to shiver. Believe me, when I say that we tried, we tried getting her to talk about what happened to her in that house. Tried, to connect with her in the physical world, one where she was distanced from the memories of a life she no longer had to live. But it was the stare... that blank glassy stare... it was all I needed to see to know we were not getting through to her, wherever she was. The light in her eyes was slowly beginning to dim and Bella stopped talking altogether. Well... while she was awake anyway. 

It was the night that got her to talk. When the moon would flood her bedroom and her eyes closed, Bella would relive her nightmare, her past and it was worse than I ever imagined. 

I would stand guard by her bedroom door, hearing her toss and turn, struggling not to let her eyes close, fighting to stay in the moment, but as her eyes grew more tired, her fidgeting quieted, and the deep shallow breaths of an uneasy night of sleep took over. It always started with a 'no'. The word seeping out through a clenched jaw. 

"NO... Stop." 

In my mind my sister was towering above her, Bella's looking up a her mother with a sea of conflicting emotions. Fear, worry, confusion, as her mother tore the belt off her hip, readying it, folding it in half, the smell of the leather as she snapped to two bands together, the noise menacing, terrifying. 

"No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it. I'm sorry, please." 

My sister was raising the belt overhead, like an executioner's blade, and bringing it down, the cowhide singing into Bella's back, her face contorting, her body clenching, spasming, twisting, seizing. She would fall to the floor under the might of her protector, holding her knees, pleading for the pain to stop. 

Bella screamed a guttural roar, one so primal, so tortured that it would make every muscle in my body tighten, my lip quivering with helplessness. 

"I'm sorry. PLEASE, PLEASE, NO PLEASE." 

Often time the dream, the memory would end abruptly, her throat letting out a croak as if she was gasping for air, other times, her suffering was prolonged, going deep into the night and the morning, the sun cresting at the window seal. Bella would stir from her slumber, eyes bloodshot, unrested, tired, and sad. Her voice would go mute, locked behind a key, chained by her thoughts, by her experiences. The clasp never unlatched, not until the sun once again hid behind the horizon and the stars conjured forth her demons, her mother. 

"NO, NO Please..."

We tried everything. The state referred us to more doctors, more therapists, and more professionals, but no one was able to help. But we did find something that seemed to help her. Bella loved to draw. I think it was a distraction, helping her mind focus on anything other than the vivid images of her past. If only the things that she would draw weren't so random. Stick figures mainly. thousands of them, some small some old, some tall some short, but all skinny. 

When she filled one paper, she would start another one, but each and every figure had distinct features, no one was alike, despite the sadness in their eyes, a sadness that was also reflected in hers.

We tried asking her about it, but she wouldn't say anything, only giving us a smile, the only time she would smile. 

Stick figures weren't the only thing she would draw. She loved shapes. Stars, numbers, even lightning bolts. She loved lightning bolts and she was good at them too. Slowly, the icy haze over her eyes was beginning to melt, and there seemed to be a spark brightening the darkness behind her gaze. 

She didn't start talking right away, it took some time, but eventually, she did. But it wasn't English. Whatever it was, it was throaty, rough, authoritative. It wasn't full sentences, just one or two. I used my phone to translate, finding out it was German. 

"Du gehst... als nächstes. Du gehst... als nächstes. Du gehst... als nächstes."

It was a phrase, she kept repeating the same phrase. 

'You, go... next.' 

It was the only thing she said for weeks. She said it thousands of times, nonstop, over and over again. To the point that she even said it in her sleep. 

"Du gehst... als nächstes. Du gehst... als nächstes. Du gehst... als nächstes."	

This was about the time she started drawing this man. It started as a portrait. He was clean-shaven and had an undercut. It was quite detailed for someone of her age. He was handsome, young, and there was something familiar about his eyes. This man started appearing in all of her drawings, among the thousands of stick figures, hidden behind the symbols. She was obsessed with this man, obsessed with the stick figures, with the symbols, with the phrase. 

"Du gehst... als nächstes. Du gehst... als nächstes. Du gehst... als nächstes." 

The man was always drawn with his hands tucked on the small of his back, his chest puffed out, and standing tall, as if the world was beneath him. I would sit and watch Bella draw. There was this strange nostalgia in her eyes as if she personally knew the man in her drawing. As if he was a friend. 

I never expected an answer when I finally asked her about him, but I wish I hadn't. I wish I didn't know, now I can't stop thinking about it, and frankly, I'm terrified of Bella now. 

The phrase fell from her throat with lackluster enthusiasm, but after saying it so many times, it had developed a sing-song tone. She was singing it as she drew the man's hair. 

Wary of derailing the progress Bella had made, I quietly walked up behind her, looking over her shoulder as the man slowly began to take shape. I touched her shoulder and she turned her head and looked at me with her newfound hope. 

"Bella, Who is that man?" 

She was surprised by the question but seemed eager to answer, eager to finally unchain her voice. Bella smiled and held the picture up, letting me get a good view of the man's eyes. 

"Er war ich, bevor ich geboren wurde."

"It was me before I was born." 

She handed me a stack of papers, and I grasped them with a confused grip. I looked at the man and then back over at Bella. They had the same look in their eyes, the same void stare. I flipped that page, finding another picture, of the man, the same expression in my niece's eyes. 

I flipped the page again. The man again, but this time he was standing on a platform, towering above the thousands of stick figures below him. They were all wearing uniforms, the man included, only this man's was different. His was green, tailored, and menacing. While the stick figures below wore, stripes, loose-fitting clothes that barely clung to their frames. I looked over at Bella again, She was standing at attention, hands behind her back, mirroring the picture in my grasp. 

My mind was sputtering, my senses screaming, denial, fear, making my skin pimple. I think I knew what the man was, but refused to believe it. No, my mind refused to let me believe it. My fingers were crinkling the edges of the pages, but I couldn't help flipping the page. 

It was as if a black hole formed directly in the center of my chest. It was sucking me in, one singular point forcing me inside, as my body crammed into the void, the ground disappeared, but I wasn't falling. There was no up, no down, no presence of time, no gravity, it was emptiness. 

The picture in my hands was of the man, of 'Bella' standing on a pile of corpses, stacked high into the sky. This picture was detailed, pristine, and I saw the gore, the sickening horror, that was beneath his boots. The faces on the corpses were gaunt, hollow, nothing more than flesh-covered skeletons. The bodies weren't the thing that evoked my horror, it was the thing that they had gone through. They had been starved, beaten, tortured, belittled, and treated less than trash, less than human, by the man that now stood on their decaying flesh, on the rotting shells. 

The pile of bodies was chaotic, with hands, feet, heads spilling out of the mound. Some clothed, others naked. Some young, some old, but all dead. Death wasn't the only thing they shared though. On the arms that sprouted from the pile, was a star, painted on an armband. It was blue on a white piece of fabric. It was the Star of David. The was a loud reverberating ping that rattled my bones, as the world around me was collapsing on top of me, but yet I refused to believe what I was looking at. I refused to believe that Bella, my neice was this... monster. She couldn't be. It was impossible, it should be impossible. I looked over the paper, Bella's cute little smile should've brought joy to my face, instead, I was scared, like looking at Pennywise himself. 

I returned to the paper. My eyes sporadically scanned the picture, simultaneous thoughts refusing to share the light. The more I scanned the more symbols I found hidden in plain sight. On the wrists of the bodies, that were connected to the arms, that were connected to the sash that clung to the arms, that were connected to the shoulders, that was connected to the withering torsos, that connected to the necks, that barely bridged the gap between chest and head by a skinny boney bridge of tissue, were serial numbers... The numbers that Bella would draw on an innocent piece of paper, cluttering the clear white surface with blasphemy, brands, like cattle on a ranch, like property from the store, barcodes that were etched on the skin of her victims. Yet, I refused to believe it. Not Bella, not my little Bella. Not my little niece, not this sweet innoce... no... not innocent. The word no longer felt right, no longer decent. My body rejected the thought, as it had accepted the truth before my mind did. 

I could no longer look at the bodies, so I looked at the man, at 'Bella'. That was when I noticed the symbols on his uniform. On his chest was a cross, each end widened at the ends, skinny at the intersection. Yet, I didn't believe it, I refused to believe it.

He had two jagged lines on his shoulders, that looked like lightning bolts, the same lighting bolts that Bella had drawn on the paper with crayon. Still, I denied it. They couldn't be S's, they were lightning bolts. 

It wasn't until I saw the helical star that wasn't a star, that I realized that the lightning bolts weren't lightning bolts, that I concluded that the iron cross on his chest wasn't so holy. 

I looked at Bella. Hoping this was all a joke, hoping that she would break out into laughter, wishing she was just a normal little girl, but the way her lips curled, as if she was proud of the things she had drawn, at the life she had once lived, told me that this wasn't a joke. 

I flipped the page, I couldn't stop looking. It was a car crash, a man on a ledge, and I was one of the spectators who gathered to see the calamity. 

But this picture was different. The man, 'Bella' was sitting in a courtroom, in front of a panel of men who all had scowling looks on their faces. The man, 'Bella', was cowering before them. Bella saw me turn the page and that was when her face started to sour, something inside me forced me to ask her, 

"Who are they Bella, who are these men?" 

That was the first time since she went mute that she answered in English, but she had an accent and her voice, baritone. 

"Those were the men who sentenced me to death." 

Her eyes started to water as if she was reliving the exact moment when they read her, no his verdict. 

"Why did they sentence you to death? Who were you before you were born?" 

The question spilled out. It was an answer that I didn't really want to know. She answered me bitterly, holding back the details that she was sure I wouldn't be able to handle. 

"Crimes against humanity. They used to call me the lamp maker." 

My knees went limp, and I fell onto the couch. 

'The lamp maker?' 

Lamps made from human flesh, from dead corpses, from the old, young, men, and women. It was evil, evil in its purest form and it was standing right in front of me, wrapped up in this little body. I heard the horrific stories from WWII and bile rose in my chest, but yet, I turned the page. 

The man was strung up by his neck, his face contorted and blue. I didn't say anything, but Bella did. 

"I dream about that day every night." 

I suddenly remembered the way she would scream for mercy, before abruptly waking from her dream. 

"That day is when my suffering began." 

I was unsure of what she meant by that but it all became clear as I turned the page. 

The man was hanging upside down on a cross, and a dark disgusting figure stood beside him. The figure had horns and furry, hooved feet. It was skinning the soldier alive, ripping pieces of his flesh one sliver at a time. The soldier's face was agonized, screaming. 

I turned the page, the soldier was on the same cross, getting skinned alive, but this time by a different creature, this one tall, pale, and slender.

I turned the page again. The soldier on the cross, the creature's skin rough, serpant-like. Bella began speaking. 

"Every day for 80 years, I answer for my 'crimes'. Every day a different demon would torture me on that fucking cross, and now I'm free."

I looked at her trembling as her voice tipped off the octave scale. 

"Your sister, my dear sweet little mommy couldn't handle me, and neither could you." 

She started stepping toward me, a dark, demented look in her eyes. 

"I wonder how nice 'you' would look on a nightstand." 

Her mouth was salivating, hungry. I fell back as I scurried away, but my back met the wall. She stepped up to me reaching my feet, but walked around me. She stood face to face with the wall, looking at the white brick, studying it, before cocking her head back and thudding it on its surface. The masonry clunked with every blow. 

'Clunk. clunk. clunk.' Her skin ripping, blood streamed down her face. 

She took a fist and bashed the side of her cheeks, her little head bobbing with each blow.

With her little fingers, she took her nails and clawed at her skin. She mutilated herself, to the point where she was unrecognizable. I thought about stepping in, trying to stop her, but was conflicted. So I just watched her do it. When she was done she slumped down on the couch, the blood soaking into its fabric, her eyes never ungluing themselves from me. We jousted there for hours until the door rang. 

"Hello? CPS, wellness check." 

My eyes widened and Bella's deep voice filled the air. 

"Those doctors you've been making me see, I told them what you did to me. How you beat me. Now, they're here. I'm getting a new home and hopefully, you're going away, somewhere where they'll lock the door and lose the key." 

I panicked, nervously pacing the house while thinking of what to do. When I built up the nerve I walked up to the door, getting ready to face what was on the other side, but as I touched the knob, the question popped into my head. I released my grip and turned back to Bella, to 'The lamp Maker'. 

"Why did they let you go?" 

Bella rolled her eyes as if the question was ridiculous. 

"They're only allowed to keep you for a maximum of 80 years, then you're free to try again, born again into the world, no matter what you did. Usually, your mind is wiped clean, but the guys down there liked my work." 

She pointed to the ground. 

"...and I get to remember who I was... in my past life." 

The realization sent shivers through my body. The generational chaos all made sense now. Every 80 years, monsters, true monsters roam the earth again. So before I open this door, I pose this question to you, to the world, who were you in your past life?
