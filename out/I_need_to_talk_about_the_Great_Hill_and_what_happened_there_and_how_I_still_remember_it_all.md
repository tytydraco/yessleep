I know the title is a weird one, but I ain't sure how else to put it. I'm hoping to get some answers or some rational thoughts from anyone on this forum. God, where do I even begin with something like this? First, if anyone here lives in Delaware, maybe you've been there too, maybe not, idk. It's this little clearing just east of Dover near some suburban community my friend grew up in. Not a bad place to live. Sorry. I feel scatterbrained today. Let me just try to start at the beginning. 

There was me. There was Jack. I was 11. He was 11. We were good friends, I think we were bonded by our shared rejection by those around us. Me, not as much as him, he couldn't help but make jokes that never landed and I couldn't help but never speak in the first place. He was bullied and I was just ignored for the most part. Every weekend it seemed I was sleeping over at his house, playing an Xbox, drinking juice, beating the shit out of each other with stuffed animals. Good times. His house was a good place, good parents, who encouraged our friendship and treated both of us well. 

We liked to screw around in the woods. I had this wooden machete that my parents had gotten from a vacation in Aruba. It was a glorified ornate stick but to us, it was a weapon to defend from life and death. The forest behind his house held a great secret about 15 minutes or so deep into the not very thick woods. Jack loved to explore, I did too, but it terrified me. I never played outside at home, and I lived in the city, forest was another planet to me. 

To be in the woods is to be vulnerable, to be weak and exposed to threats incomprehensible. I've been paranoid every since I was young. I saw monsters and ghost in the night, I hear voices creeping when I slept. I slept so tightly under the covers I would overheat and choke from being suffocated under blankets. To this day I still don't like the dark, even as a grown man. People don't understand why I fear the dark, I simply say that in the dark anything can exist, even the unfathomable. I'm sorry. I feel like I'm losing track again.   


The secret, yeah, it was a pile of dirt. But this, this was no normal pile. It was a mound reaching by what I remember, 40 or so feet into the air, to a kid it was Everest. We never knew where it had come from, why it existed, or its purpose. Though I guessed to myself with what little kid logic I had they had once been building something, yet now there was nothing more than a giant circle cleared of trees and a great dirt tower at the center of it all. 

So we, along with other children from the neighborhood who we recruited, 3 other boys, 2 brothers, and a younger kid who would sneak out to join us journeyed to the great hill. I, despite my fear was there leader, I did have the weapon after all. I think they thought I was smart, I wasn't, nobody at the age of 11 is. When we reached the hill it was like we had found Eden, the land must have been cleared for some time, it was all grassy compared to the dead soil of the forest. Lots of flowers and weeds, bad for my allergies, but good for the soul.

It takes a while to climb a dirt skyscraper, it had a semi slope on the slide as if it was meant to be hiked and a nice flat top to sit upon that could probably fit 20 people safely, where I had promptly planted a flag I had drawn, taping it to a little wooden stick. Whoever created the hill now yielded it to us, it was ours. The 5 of us sat upon the top of the hill and I will never forget that day in my life. I looked at Jack and said the following:

**How'd you find out about this place?**

*I had this dream one night. This uh, It's hard to describe. I was in the woods, and it called to me, told me to follow and I did and it brought me here. Went out the next day with Raheim and Ahmed and we found-*

**Woah woah woah. What told you to follow?** 

*Beats me. It was just something. Like a voice, but one of those ones in your head. You know?*

**Well that's fucking scary.**

*Bro.*

**What?**

*I don't think I've heard you curse before.* 

All I could do was laugh, brushing aside his weird dreams. We sat in silence and watched the trees sway among the joyous sky's and pure air, held lovingly by warm weather. The other boys busied themselves with climbing, jumping, and saying stupid shit. Eventually I felt like I had to speak again, I was too curious. 

**You aren't screwing with me, right?**

*About the dream? Nah. It really happened*.

**And you actually followed the path you took in the dream and found this?**

*Yeah, why would I lie about this?*

**Because it's weird. Like, really weird.**

*Weird, but pretty cool.* 

A cool breeze ran by the air and drifted across the sky, I didn't like it. It sent a chill down down my back I can still feel whenever I remember it. He could tell I felt uncomfortable. 

**Come on Connor, let's get back home. Dad's getting McDonald's tonight.** 

Hell yeah. We gathered the group and made our way back, I pretended to hack my way through non existent brush as if I was exploring the jungles of Africa. Jack watched my eyes dart around to each branch, each crack in the woods, every moment I searched. I think he felt bad for me. He could tell I didn't process fear right. 

*What are you looking for?*

**Nothing. Just keeping and eye out.** 

*For what?*

**Anything! You never know what-**

Suddenly he stopped in place. He grabbed my shoulder and shushed me. I saw the fear of god in his eyes. We both stood perfectly in place frozen. I whispered so quietly I'm amazed he could hear me at all.

**What???**

*Do you hear that?*

I listened, I could hear faint crackling of branches, as the others boys stopped and stood still, we could all hear it. Something was moving. Something was breaking twigs. Nobody wanted to move their bodies, nobody wanted to see what it was. But whatever it was, was moving towards us, slowly, carefully, and from our left. 

*You hear the static?*

**The what?**

I think it's slenderman. I can feel him, he must-

All at once he burst out laughing and pushed himself away from me, cackling. It was most tempting in that moment to finally make good use of my machete but I restrained myself though with great difficulty. We all watched as a squirrel jumped from twig to twig from the source of the cracking and it made it's way up the tree's happily living it's little life. The little kid with us almost began to cry and the brothers looked more than pissed off. Jack probably thought he deserved an award though.

That was the first time we had ever visited the hill. But it wouldn't be the last. We would make journeys and expeditions, mapping the endless woods, making new routes and climbing the hill. It was home away from home. When we learned kids from the other wealthier neighborhood close to it also ventured there we geared for war, when we learned they were older and bigger, peace negotiations were fast. The Great Hill was the coolest place to be for any kid, only if you could make the journey through the treacherous woods.

I loved the Great Hill, but I hated the journey to it. It always felt like the woods were watching us. I swore I would see eyes, see movements at the edges of our vision. I was convinced there were bears, creepy pastas, and bad people waiting to end our lives. I should have known better. But I didn't. I'm sorry Jack. I did try. I really did. I promised I would talk about it.  Let me go back to the night. I'm going to make it a separate and hopefully more organized post. Should be up soon. Be patient with me please.
