Many years ago, on this very day, I would have been hunched over my desk. There was kleenex by my side, as I typed away, red-nosed, and as the last of my coworkers trickled out for the night. That season, all the department was abuzz, working on pieces related to the nearing election, though I was stuck writing its scraps. A pile of my rejected articles were stacked to my side, headlines illuminated by the desk lamp.

“District Rep. Martin Donates Generous Sum to Local Church”

“Baby Names ‘Christopher’ and ‘Martin’ Trending After District Representative Christopher Martin”

It was obvious which candidate was popular with the townsfolk. Blonde-haired, church-going Christopher Martin with his heavy golden watch, five years my junior and a rising star. He graduated at the top of his class, worked from the bottom with not a scandal nor crime on his record. Now there was a man who had it all…

As my thoughts drifted, a great gust of wind rattled the window, snapping me alert.

The morning outside was dark, and the streets were darker, with the snow taking a bluish hue, and not a streetlight in sight. But just as I was about to look away, from the edge of my eye, I spotted a flash of gold. 

A figure, watch flashing on his wrist, with blond hair poking out from under his hat, strode across the street with barely-contained haste. 

Immediately, I got up. I grabbed my camera, my pad and pencil, and dashed down the wooden staircase, hardly able to stop myself from tripping. I fumbled with the combination lock on the main floor doors, and slid across the marble reception floor. However, by the time I pushed open the ground floor doors, Christopher Martin had disappeared into the night. 

There was only the sleeping city on which the snow fell softly, down, down, until the ground, where a set of fresh footprints were imprinted on the snow. 

Following the footprints down the road, I again gave chase, and was led into an alley with a terrible draft that tore straight through my bare clothes. I hugged myself tight to protect any remaining warmth, the frigid air whipping around me. Then another draft came in the opposite direction like a push, sending me deeper into the narrow passage. 

So I continued, turning from corner to corner in a labyrinth of alleys, passing a flickering lamplight, then a row of ransacked trash, then a series of houses with boarded-up windows, until the path I pursued forked. And the footprints did not continue on either side. 

In front, there loomed a dark, dilapidated building with walls so covered with grime their original color was obscured, and a burgundy door whose paint job was peeling off like skin, left ever so slightly ajar, creaking back and forth with the wind. 

Behind the door, one could just barely glimpse a steep flight of stairs leading straight downwards, despite the three stories atop the building seemed to carry.

Click. With my hands red from the cold, I took a picture of the door. 

Click, click. Then two of my surroundings. 

Then was my chance to scamper away without having disturbed a thing, as quiet as a mouse, back to my company floor where all was warm and safe. I imagined reporting this newfound scoop to the office, submitting these photos, and watching all the glory be snatched by whoever the office deemed more worthy. A younger, more talented man. I would never be able to forgive myself if that happened. No matter the warnings my instincts screamed at me, shivering in front of the yawn of that building.

I slipped through the weathered door, stepping down the first step, where the old wood groaned. Its sound was just barely hidden by the howling winds outside, so I crouched down low and descended the stairs, three at a time. 

The chill slowly began to dissipate, but was immediately replaced by uncomfortable heat once I reached the bottom. In the space lingered the feel of an abandoned factory, —parching, dusty air, backdropped with the hum of enginery from all directions, and not a window in sight. Gingerly, I stepped forward, but my shoe scraped loudly against something. Paper, by its sound.

I picked it up, but could barely make out its soaked-then-dried writing. 

Some many kilograms of salt. 

And blood jasper. Specified to be red and green, smooth and shining.

Then some other details, I decided, that could be deciphered in the comfort of my cubicle. 

Wrapping my camera in the hem of my sweater, I muffled its shutter. *Click*. 

I continued to navigate the dark by touch alone, sidestepping rusted machinery and weaving through stacks of cobwebbed crates, snapping odd photos of stray documents and syringes underfoot. Despite the heat and the dark, the corners of my mouth lifted. There was a thrill to this. Dangerous adventure.

Then my hand brushed a plank the size of a door, leaning straight against the wall. A dim light radiated from behind it, casting shadows onto the floor. 

*Click*. First, a picture where the plank was closed. Then, I inched the plank open, just slightly enough, and peered through the narrow opening.

“I thank you for the opportunities and successes you have helped me achieve,” Martin’s voice echoed across the room steadily, his forehead illuminated with sweat. He stood stiff as a pole, with his head bowed. “But my conscience is burdened.” 

I readied my pad and paper to record Martin’s lines. There was a stronger heat emanating from the gap to the room, drying my eyes as fast as I could blink. A bead of sweat trickled down my face.

“When,” a deep, viscous voice rumbled “hath thy conscience been of consideration?” It shook the walls and hammered my pencil against the pad, reducing my writing to a chaotic scrawl. Its hiss was neither of man nor woman, nothing like I had ever heard. “Not growing one just as thy deal nears its end, I trust?”

“I have a family now, one I very much adore—”

“Aye, a quite quaint family. And a load of wage, with a grand reputation I’ve granted ye.” The voice came closer now, and Martin took a step back. Even outside the room, I could feel the atmosphere thicken. 

“Then take them away!” Martin shouted suddenly, before he tripped on his own feet and landed square on his ass. “The money and the fame, I mean! And go away with them!” 

In response, a searing gust burst out of the gap, sending me reeling with a hand over my eye and my tools clattering to the floor. 

“Insolence!” The voice boomed. I flinched. The sheer power of it shook the ceiling. 

“Thou hast bound thyself with thy own greed,” the voice hissed with quiet threat. “In three weeks' notice, just as promised, I shall cometh for thee.”

However, Christopher Martin seemed not to listen. He was fumbling around his breast-pocket, clumsy fingers desperately grasping for something. 

“Wrong,” he finally interjected. He held out a small vial of water like a shield, its contents reflecting what little light the room offered. “I’ve told my church about you and I’ve confessed my sins,” he came to his feet. “You have no more power over me!” With a flourish, he raised the vial defiantly. “Our deal is off.”

His eyes stared straight ahead, silently goading. 

Then, “come hither,” the demon commanded. 

“I shall n—”

“I command the scribe.”

Behind the plank, my breath caught. I Considered running. Whoever Martin conversed with was not of this world, but of the next. Some infernal entity from the depths of the Earth. My entire being urged me to flee, to run through the dim basement, up the stairs, and never look back. But by some unseen force, I was pulled forward. 

“Come. Hither.”

I gingerly inched open the plank, and was blasted with a full face of heat, like walking into a burning room. There was the crunch of crystals underfoot. Salt. Before being blown away, they must have formed a circle around Martin.

Said man had his eyes darting back and forth between the demon and I, still holding out the vial. 

“You lured him here!” Martin exclaimed. “You meant to ruin me!”

The demon stood opposite to Martin, and took up the height of that room, clothed in flame. So bright I couldn’t even look straight.

“I sense a hunger within thee, for renown, fame, and fortune.” Ignoring Martin, the demon whispered near my ear, hot enough to scorch skin. “Spin a tale of that good sir overindulging in his vices, leading to his untimely demise…And I will make you an illustrious man.”

Suddenly, “back, creature!” Martin yelled, reaching to open his vial. But before his fingers could touch the lid, the vial was flung away by an unseen force, sending it clattering into the shadows.

The demon let out a roar and engulfed the room in a maelstrom of malevolent energy. The orange light flared, and the shadows twisted into grotesque forms, writhing and clawing at the air. The heat intensified, enough to sear skin and fill the room with the acrid scent of burning sulfur. 

Christopher Martin sunk to the ground, clutching his hands to his chest, panting like a rabid dog. “My hands…” He started weakly. “What did you do to them?” His fingers blistered and peeled away, revealing raw, red flesh. 

Barely able to keep my footing, I watched in sheer terror as the very fabric of reality seemed to warp around the demon's presence. Martin was lifted off his feet by an invisible force, his body flailing as he floated helplessly in the air. 

“Put me down, you motherfucker!” He screamed, attempting to twist his body out of the demon’s invisible grip. “Our deal is not over. You don’t get to do this to me!” Then, having seemingly moved with too much force, Christopher Martin found the upper half of his body rotated one-eighty degrees from his bottom half. His vertebrae cracked violently, the wind was knocked out of his lungs, and his voice broke into choked screams. 

“For years thou hast enjoyed the luxury of our deal,” the demon's voice was guttural. “Yet only now, when the time for me to reap mine own reward draws near, dost thou realize its true cost”

Martin’s body contorted as he tried to voice his protest, legs overlapping one another and arms being bent at unnatural angles. His skin stretched and began to tear, and I had no stomach to watch any more. I covered my eyes, not bearing to see, but heard the sounds of bones snapping and the weak gurgle of Martin’s throat. In between snivels and sobs, his breaths were short, gasps. But he was not gasping. He was begging. 

“Please.”

Then the sound of bones breaking overtook him. 

Finally, Martin was dangled as limp as a rag doll, silent as a corpse. Between my fingers, I saw blood and bits of flesh trickle to the floor, like water wrung from a towel. Martin’s mangled form fell, hitting the ground with a sickening *crunch*. 

“In thy remaining time alive, thou shalt live in fear and ridicule,” the demon declared at the gore. ”Thou wealth shalt be taken, thou reputation soiled, thou family departed.” The bones wiggled, then shifted, coming together to reassemble themselves. His muscles were forced to fuse back, and his skin stretched across his body, each layer knitting itself together, reconstructing the man from within to out. “And at which hour thou art miserable and alone,” Martin’s eyes burst open, bloodshot and red-rimmed, “having cried thy last drops of sorrow,” he slowly crawled himself into a ball, re-learning his own limbs, “that is when I shall cometh for thee.” And he cried. Great, heaving sobs wracking his frame as he gasped for air, wailing like a newborn. His clothes were tatters strewn across the floor, his golden watch abandoned, and spirit completely, utterly shattered. 

Paying him no mind, as if all in a day’s work, the demon turned to me. “Be not afraid, mortal.” Its voice would have been gentle had I not been paralyzed with fear. “Christopher Martin was unable to bear the weight of his own greed, but I sense that you are different. Thou art one who understandeth the world and hath sacrificed like no other.” 

With a wave of the demon’s hand, I saw myself back at my company, furiously typing away, day and night, as my co-workers enjoyed praise, promotions and bountiful successes. “Thou labor is seen. All thy needeth be aid. Consider,” scenarios of success flashed before me. My editor, my coworkers, my higher-ups, clapping for *me*. My name in articles, the journalist of the year. 

“I am not temptation,” my mother smiling with pride. My girlfriend on the altar. 

“I am opportunity.” 

Yes, my old self wanted to say. I would have danced for joy and thanked the demon on my bare knees. This was the breakthrough I needed, all I ever wanted, offered on an infernal palm. 

But the face of Christopher Martin, face pink and wrinkled like a naked newborn. Tears, snot and drool trickling down his face all at once, gurgling on his own spit. I imagined myself after all the eminence, reduced to a pitiful wreck, consumed by the same shadow that swallowed Martin whole. 

I raised my camera once more. I snapped straight at the demon, the flash blindingly bright in the dark room.

Then I ran. I ran like a man possessed, knees almost scraping the ground, out of the basement room, through the stacks of crates and apparatus, up the flight of stairs, and burst through the building door. My breath came in ragged gasps, and I did not have time to register the drastic cold before I set out again. I fled through the twisting, narrow alleyways, taking any route that led far away, until finally I arrived out in an open street. 

My lungs burned and my legs threatened to give out. Martin’s ruined form was all I could see. I urged myself to go faster.

In the quiet morning there was nobody to alert, not a car to wave down, only the sleeping town blanketed by snow, unaware and indifferent. But at the side of the road, I found it. Bright red and covered in snow, a payphone. 

I rang the emergency number. I do not remember what I said. Only it sounded believable enough for the state of Christopher Martin to make headline news the next day.

I wish the same could be said for my report. 

The sun had not even set before it fell right back on my desk. 

“We don’t publish nonsense,” my editor sighed.

“Didn’t I tell you? Wait three weeks. Christopher Martin will die, and if I’m correct—”

“So what if he dies? You’re telling me you met a demon, and you’re still fine, sitting here like a chump?”

“Well have you seen my phot–”

“Pack up, son.” A new voice. “I’m chief executive director of this department. Company policy doesn’t tolerate liars.”

The next morning, my cubicle was emptied, and I was ushered down the stairs with a single, overflowing box. Passing me were a line of important-looking people, —I recognized university deans, celebrities, millionaires— and every single one stared at my passing. I felt their eyes down each floor, from the building exit, even from inside my car. 

I felt their stare in the priest who denied my entry, at the church Martin most frequently donated to. 

I prayed for Martin in the parking lot.

Despite his own efforts, or even mine, Christopher Martin’s downfall already started to unfold. His first scandal involved drugs. Word spread that he’d been misusing his campaign funds to fuel his vices, leading to a penalty of millions in settlements. His wife and child left him. Then he fumbled his speeches, upset his own party, and set off a movement to have him replaced. So his position was revoked, divorce took away his assets, and at the end, not a single paper was reporting on his name. 

Three weeks passed, and Christopher Martin was gone. I searched for work, but did not hear back from even a single company. Not even my family, girlfriend or friends would answer my calls. I was completely alone.

And alone I remained, even as I moved and changed my name. It was to start anew, forget the past. But my dreams persisted. About that small, dark, room. Six feet below ground, with walls on all sides, and a blazing inferno in front of me. And when I look up, above me are a thousand eyes, each larger than my entire being, staring and unblinking.

Many decades have passed since that fateful day, and I have become washed up with time. Today marks the third week I’ve been turned away from the food bank. I have been sifting through the trash for crumbs, which yields me day-old pizza on a good day and starvation on a bad one. But today was not just a good day –I think I’ve found a lifeline. While my right hand types my story at the library computer, my left hand clutches a mineral. Red and green, smooth and shining, blood jasper.
