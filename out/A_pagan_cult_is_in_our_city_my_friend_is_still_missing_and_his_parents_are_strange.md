Hey folks, sorry for the delay in updating you. Things here have been a bit tense, and my investigation has been getting heavier. The tension in São Miguel das Águas continued to grow as the weeks passed. My life has turned into a desperate race against time. (You can read [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16y378k/i_dont_know_where_the_evidence_points/) , [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/170om4d/i_still_dont_know_where_the_evidence_points_and_i/)  and [Part ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/174qkyn/why_my_friend_kill_an_elderly/)3 here)  
  
Since the experience in the cabin, I've been having very realistic nightmares almost every night. I see Rafael, with empty eyes, endlessly repeating the spiral pattern as darkness envelops him. I could feel the presence of Murucututu watching, no longer peaceful but seeming to judge me with its yellow eyes. These nightmares, filled with symbolism and anguish, gradually took away the only moment of peace I still had.  
  
My search yielded valuable information and led me to an old manuscript in the local library. In it, I found mentions of a secret group that used the spiral symbol. They called themselves "The Enigmatics of the Celestial Serpent," and according to the manuscript, it was believed that this group conducted obscure rituals of an ancient Sumerian religion (or something close to that).  
  
I decided to seek out the elderly librarian, Mr. Armando, probably the oldest resident of the town. His memory was fading, but he mumbled about the group, and I managed to record a part of it:  
  
Me: "Can you please repeat that last part? What did they really want?"  
  
Armando: "Ah yes... they... they wanted to open a portal, wanted to... um... make contact with their god, some kind of space serpent or something. Madness, my son."  
  
Me: "Make contact?"  
  
Armando: "Yes, I suppose it's like in every religion. They believed that this creature would give them special knowledge, immortality... the usual: people who are afraid of dying. And now, it seems we have these fools imitating those actions."  
  
Me: "You don't seem to like them."  
  
Armando: "And I don't. Back then, my nephew started hanging out with those cultists. He was quite young at the time and eventually disappeared..."  
  
Mr. Armando looked sadly into the void while resting his hand on his chest. My eyes were drawn to his name tag. "Armando Bezerra."  
  
Me: "I... I think I remember seeing something about that. He was friends with Mr. Pedro (may he rest in peace), right? It was Rubens, right?"  
  
Armando (his voice visibly choked with tears): "Yes... he was. I never married, always took care of this collection, and wanted to study, that's why Rubens was almost like a son to me. I loved the boy... You know, young man, if you saw your friend, he could still be saved, I suppose. I shouldn't be telling you this; I don't want to get into trouble." (He looked around and approached me.) "But they used to have their cults in the old basilica on the hill in town. I know they had some sort of snake statue and kept the map in it. Now go, I don't want to dwell on this anymore."  
  
I left the desolate old man behind and was motivated to explore further. Despite all the fear, it was still exciting, like an Indiana Jones movie: relics, ancient religions, artifacts. However, as I left the library, I felt I was being watched. The suspicion was about to fall on me, and I knew time was running out.  
  
I ran along a path off the beaten road to the old, abandoned church on the outskirts of town. I began climbing every hill, initially with ease, then with more difficulty. The recent spring rains had left the mud sticky and slippery, even discomforting my feet inside my boots. As night fell, I was guided by vague clues, following the faint light of a lantern.  
  
Finally, I reached the top. The city glowed with its lights, seeming so peaceful from that distance, detached from all the evil surrounding it. The church was its total opposite, dark, old, decrepit, and it seemed to carry all the evil that had happened inside it in the air. I entered through the crumbling door and began searching for something resembling a snake. I walked to the back courtyard and came across some crosses. I don't know if it's the same around the world, but at least here in Brazil, in ancient times, especially in small towns, it was common to bury the dead behind the church. And there, among the tombstones and a few angel statues, I saw the snake, bathed in the pale moonlight. It stood proudly, almost as if challenging me to approach.  
  
Carefully, I began to examine the sculpture until I noticed that in its mouth, there was a wooden tube with a cap on one end, resembling a graduation diploma tube. I picked it up, and when I opened it, I found an old map of the city, with some corners eaten by moths but nothing that compromised its content. I was on my way back through the church when I saw car headlights approaching and parking in front. I hid in one of the pews, holding my breath as I prayed, hoping the sacred ground would carry my prayers to the heavens. Heavy boot steps marked the wooden floor of the church as the car door slammed, and another pair of shoes joined the first.  
  
They walked casually, probably unaware of my presence. I'll call them A and B, A was probably the older one, with a rougher, more authoritative voice, and B seemed younger but not inexperienced.  
  
B: "Listen, do we really need to come here? This place gives me the creeps."  
  
A: "Quiet. The serpent doesn't like insolence. It's a good opportunity for you to observe how the offering is made."  
  
The steps led to the church's cemetery, and I raised my head slightly and could see two hooded figures walking toward the back. The one in front carried a white ceramic plate with what looked like a piece of meat on it. They walked up to the snake and bowed, placing the plate at the statue's base. I took the opportunity to start moving, very slowly, stepping carefully on the wooden boards to avoid making noise. I was about 4 meters from the door when one of them stood up slowly. He raised his head and looked at the snake's mouth, probably noticing the absence of the map.  
  
A: "Hey, the map, it's gone! Did someone tell you it was time to use it?"  
  
B: "No, they said we had to get it only on the day of the eclipse." (For reference, there was an eclipse on the 14th, Saturday, and this event took place on the 12th, Thursday.)  
  
A: "Come on, get back to the car; we have to inform the others quickly."  
  
I picked up the pace, and in my panic, I ended up kicking the edge of the pew and making noise. They turned immediately and started running in my direction. I dove into the underbrush and rolled down the hill, gaining some scratches along the way. I heard one of them shouting to the other to get in the car and leave while he would come after me through the thicket.  
  
The footsteps behind me grew louder, and this guy seemed to be in good physical shape and familiar with the area. While my heavy breathing and stumbling over branches revealed my location, I could hardly hear his steps, which were getting closer. He was on my tail when suddenly I saw the road ahead, it was my chance, I ran while a car was approaching, and at the same time, he caught up with me, squeezing his hand on my shoulder.  
  
The car's headlights hit us, and we both stopped. The darkness our eyes had adjusted to had temporarily blinded us from this strong glare. Were the headlights from his friend? Was it someone else coming to help me? I didn't want to take the risk, so I decided to act like the cornered animal I was at that moment: I bit his hand as hard as I could, feeling my teeth sink into his flesh, and the taste of iron filling my mouth, dripping the red liquid down my chin. He screamed in pain and released his grip, allowing me to cross the road and finally reach the town.  
  
Let's say that what came next was a result of justified paranoia: I knew it was only a matter of time before they caught me. They probably knew who I was, that I had the map, and soon my entire investigation would go down the drain. Or maybe not, I thought of the only thing I could do: leave it with someone else. I thought for a few days, and the only people that came to mind were Rafael's family. His parents deserved this, and they could continue searching for their son if they wanted to. I gathered everything I had in a folder and a USB drive, took the map, and headed to their house. I didn't seem to be followed, but I was still uneasy.  
  
It was all... too quiet considering everything that had happened. I arrived at their house and knocked on the door. His mother answered, and she seemed startled to see me, which was a reaction I expected, given the sleepless nights and recent wounds making me look like a mere shell of who I once was. I asked for permission to enter and told her I needed to talk to her about Rafa. I sat in the kitchen while she toasted some bread in the oven.  
  
She - You look so skinny, you need to eat. Just wait a little while; Tobias is getting water from the well, and I'll make some coffee for you in a bit.  
  
Tobias is my friend's father.  
  
Me - I didn't know you had a well.  
  
She - Oh, we've always had one, but it's been hard to use because we broke the wall around it. It's too dangerous for someone to fall in.  
  
I looked out the window and saw Mr. Tobias fetching water. Given the length of the rope, it would indeed be quite a fall... my heart started to race, and I quickly put my hand on my stomach.  
  
Me - Look, ma'am, I need to use the bathroom real quick; I'm not feeling well.  
  
She - You know where it is, right? Make yourself at home.  
  
I rushed upstairs and entered the white wooden door, locking it quietly behind me. I needed to start writing to you guys, and I think this might be my last post. When I looked out the window and saw the well, I noticed something: Mr. Tobias's hand was bandaged. The same hand I had bitten a few days ago. Things started to make a sinister sense now. Could the "fall" that Rafael had mentioned earlier have any connection to the well? I overheard Mr. Tobias saying some things through the window; he mentioned something like, "I've tried everything, his phone, the pursuit. I didn't want to do this; he's a good kid. But Cabeça told us to do the same thing we did to Pedro..." I've been up here for 20 minutes...  
  
Rafael's mother is knocking on the door, asking if everything's okay, and I can hear Mr. Tobias's footsteps coming up the stairs...
