I wanted to share my story with you, since it was really creepy and it happened to me couple days ago. I'm not the type of person who gets scared easily, but this incident really freaked me out.

So a little backstory about me. Im an 19 year old female and I live by myself. I'm pretty much a home person and I like spending time by myself. I usually spend my time hanging with my two cats, writing, reading and listening to music.

But that night I was really bored and wanted to do something so I decided to go out, and hang out at the city center of my city. I live 10km away from the center so I decided to take a bus, because the day had been really cold and it has snowed so I couldn't really use my bike. 

I left my house around 5pm and arrived to the center at about 6.30pm. I headed to the mall and checked out couple new shops that had been opened and looked for inspiration for Christmas presents. I also wanted to go check out another smaller mall nearby so I started making my way in there. It was really cold when I got out again and it had started snowing again, so I decided to take a shortcut through another smaller mall, which had pretty much been empty for a quite awhile and had only one grocerieshop . The place was empty so I started to make my way through the hall. After 5 meters I noticed someone standing in front of me. From my first glance it looked like a middle aged man just standing there, looking blankly ahead of him. I didn't really think anything of it, because maybe he was cold also and wanted to warm up, so I just continued to walk. After walking for a little bit, I think the man heard me coming because he turned around and started starring at me. Again I didn't really think anything about it. But when I got closer I saw the mans face and kinda got spooked. He had a really dirty face, with little scars all over his face and really big eyes. He was really tall and skinny and his stand was a little crooked. However I decided to ignore it and just quickly wanted to pass him since I already saw the exit door. But when I passed him and accidentally made eye contact I was scared shitless. He started humming a what sounded like a lullaby and the most sinister smile accused on his face from ear to ear. I quickly looked away and almost sprinted to the exit door. 

I didn't look back until I was at the other mall. I was creeped out but thought to myself that it was just some drug user or a drunk guy, since they were really common in that part of the town.

I spent some time at the other mall, soon forgetting this incident. Time went by really fast and at around 8.30pm I decided to go buy some food and head home. I went to the malls grocery store and bought supplies for a salad and made my way to the checkout. The lines were long and since there was only one checkout open, I had to wait for a little for my turn to come. When it was my turn I started paying and while waiting for the cashier to count and hand me my change I glanced to the exit door at the mall. That's when my heart sank. That same man was standing there watching me and smiling. I felt my heartbeat fasten and quickly packed my shit up and walked past him out the doors without looking at him.

I went to my bus stop to wait for my bus since it was suppose to be there in like 5 minutes. The stop was really packed to my surprise since it was kinda late and usually the bus was really empty. However, I put my headphones on and started to listen music not really paying attention to my surroundings until the bus came. I was pretty much the last person to step in the bus because I waited little further away from everyone else, and by the time I got in, all the seats were taken, so I had to stand at the middle of the bus. The trip went by real fast since I was listening to my jams and kinda zoning out. When my stop came, I stepped out and started walking towards my home. From the stop to my house is like 20 meters so not that bad. Some other person also jumped off at the same stop after me and walked like 10 meters away from me.

When I got to the house complex door I glanced back to see if the other person was my neighbor so I could hold the door open for them, because it was not uncommon for me to be on the same bus with my neighbors for some reason. However I didn't see anyone and decided to enter to the hall and make my way to my door. I heard a loud noice coming from the main doors. Like someone with force tried to yank the door open. I almost went there to check it out, but something didn't feel right. I entered my house and double checked that the door was locked. 

My apartment windows are headed to the road you need to walk to get the apartments so I checked the road if I saw someone maybe my neighbor at the door or something. I didn't see anyone at the door anymore so I started to unpack my stuff. After unpacking I went to the kitchen to get a glass of water and glanced to the road, only to see a shadowy figure standing there. I got this uneasy feeling in my stomach and decided to close my blinds since I live in the first floor and you can see inside my apartment from the street. After drinking I went to the living room to watch tv and passed out, since I was really tired.

I woke up at 11.30pm to this weird noice coming from my balcony. I thought it was some teenagers once again throwing snowballs to the balcony window because it wouldn't be the first time. I got up and went to the kitchen where my balcony door was and peeked through the blinds, and what I saw made my blood turn cold and turned my stomach upside down.

It was the same man from the mall, knocking at my balcony window and smiling. I stepped away and reached to my phone in my pocket to call the police. I think the man saw me peeking because I could really faintly hear him humming his lullaby and saying ''I saw you already, there's no point hiding. Come on out, I just want to ask something''. I was so scared I felt like I was gonna throw up. I called the police and still could hear the man knocking. I didn't move, I didn't make a sound. I stood there, holding back tears and waiting for the police with felt like hours. After 10 minutes he stopped knocking and let out a scream. Then it all just stopped. No noice. No knocking. Nothing. 

I heard a car turn up to the parking space and peeked again. It was the cops and I made my way out to the front of the house to give description about the man and told them what happened. The police said that they would checkout the area, but it was possible that the man had ran to the forest nearby to get away. They left but said they would come back if they found something.

After all the police found nothing or no one. There was nothing they could do at that point. They told me to call again if he appeared. The fact that none of my neighbors were around or none of them heard or saw anything made it more difficult.

 It was probably just some junkie stalker, and only god knows what would've happened if the glass window on my balcony was open and my balcony door unlocked.

Needles to say this really creeped me out and makes me think twice before leaving my house alone after dark.
