She fell asleep. That was all the opportunity we needed to defy the rule about Saturday morning cartoons. 

We could watch Disney stuff and Looney Tunes, but GI Joe, Transformers, Smurfs, He-Man and some other less memorable shows were not allowed. 

Especially forbidden, however - the one we were told would corrupt our souls within a single viewing - was the Dungeons & Dragons cartoon that ran from 1982 to 1985. If you’re unfamiliar, the show was about some kids who get trapped in the dangerous and fantastical world of D&D. 

That's about how much I actually remember about it. I looked it up on Wikipedia recently. Apparently, it was pretty violent - A lot of 80's content was though, wasn't it? The National Coalition On Television Violence pressured the FTC to put a warning at the beginning of each episode: they wanted it to say that D&D was directly responsible for people violently dying. 

The NCTV's request was soundly denied due to a total lack of evidence.

That didn't stop a good chunk of the world, including my parents, from believing that evil lurked within the pages of Tolkien and - I don't know - under Smurf hats? 

All of it became banned from our household.

And that’s what made it so fascinating. Ironically, if everybody had just shut up, we probably wouldn't have cared about the D&D cartoon. They'd turned it into forbidden fruit. Plus, looney tunes got pretty boring after half an hour.

Our younger brother, Matthew, was still a baby. He fell asleep on Mom and she was out on the couch before the coyote got clobbered with his own anvil. John, my older brother by three years, looked at me before creeping to the TV.

“What are you doing?” I asked. “Don't,” I added when his fingers turned the dial. “We'll get in trouble.”

“Shut up, Pete,” he replied softly. He crouched and watched the screen. I scooted forward and sat next to him on the floor. For the first time, we watched beyond the opening of the show. I vaguely remember a rollercoaster or a ride of some kind. The cartoon kids got transported and changed into wizards and warriors. There's a little kid in a barbarian costume with a club, I’m pretty sure. 

I couldn't tell you what the episode was about because I couldn't focus. I was scared. Our parents said this exact cartoon was evil, and could hurt us. At some point, I reached to change the channel. John grabbed my wrist and squeezed until it hurt.

I could have woken up Mom. I could have screamed and hit my brother. I could have told on John, and blamed him entirely for what we were doing. Instead, I rubbed my wrist and continued watching.

That's about when the shot cut to a dark and cluttered room. Television was less refined in the 80s. Commercials were all kinds of crazy. So we weren't scared until we recognized the room as our very own unfinished basement.

“That’s my pennant,” John said. He pointed at a yellow felt triangle sticking out of a box, the one I'd thrown up on last Christmas. Dad had kept it with some idea of restoring the accolade. We all knew it would rot down there. We joked about it.

I didn't understand. “Why is it on TV?”

John looked afraid. He didn't understand either. “I don't-”

A man walked into the shot, his back to the camera. He was tall and had on a dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up. His hair was wavy and blond like Bo's from Dukes of Hazzard. 

He seemed to be looking for something but not very hard. Faster than expected, he spun and his face was close to the camera. Both John and I flinched and reached for each other.

“Who do we have here?” he breathed into what sounded like a microphone touching his moustached lips. His face moved up and down in the frame and we saw only his eye at one point, and then his mouth again. 

John's eyes darted back and forth from the TV to our basement door. I was shaking so hard. 

The man grasped the camera, the sides of our screen, and stepped back so we could see his entire face. He looked like an actor with a practised smile. 

For the rest of my days, I will never forget that face for its incongruity. The genuine mirth in the curvature of his lips were in stark contrast to his soulless, blue eyes. 

A familiar creak came from the last basement stair. John covered my mouth as I began to yelp. The strange ordeal on the screen ended. D&D resumed. Stunned, we watched for a few more seconds before John turned the dial back to Looney Tunes.

He crossed his lips for me to be quiet, and crept over to the basement door. 

I shook my head. “No, John, no,” I rasped. 

He ignored me as he disappeared into the kitchen and returned with a steak knife. With a trembling hand, he opened the basement door, lifting the handle to stop the hinges from whining. Then that nine-year-old boy went down the steps, intent on defending his family as the man of the house. Our dad worked every day but Sunday.

The minute or so of total silence felt excruciatingly long. Yet, John returned without ceremony. He put the knife away and came back to the living room. 

 “What happened?” I asked him.

He shook his head. “Nothing. There's nobody down there. Must be some weird prank.”

“But that was our basement,” I countered.

He shrugged. “Nah. I mean, maybe, I guess. But probably not. A lot of basements look the same, Pete.”

Mom started to wake up.

“But the pennant,” I said. He ignored me. 
 
The rest of the day went by like any other Saturday. We played outside with the neighbourhood kids. John and I didn't talk about the weird commercial. We certainly didn't mention defying the ban on popular cartoons. 

But I felt bad. Worse, I felt damned. Like I was for sure going to hell when I died. For weeks, I prayed for forgiveness and became more anxious about dying. Fuck, I was six-years-old. 

The feeling never really went away but I could sleep and play. I suppose the fear relented as the memory of the ordeal faded. 

I only know this to be true, however, because the terror came right back the night we found John sleepwalking. 

We shared a bunk bed. He always let me pick the top or bottom as I preferred. Those days I chose the top. Made me feel a little safer knowing my older brother was between me and whatever monsters might be trying to get in. I never suspected him of being the monster.

I recoiled into a ball when a face in our darkened bedroom appeared above the rail of my bunk. It was John, of course, but his eyes were nearly shut and he was muttering gibberish. He left our bedroom and turned on the hallway light before heading downstairs.

Both mom and dad were in their doorway by the time I got there. It'd been really difficult to get out of bed. John's strange behaviour I immediately connected to our transgression. If that sounds ridiculous, I can assure you the events that followed only assured me of it.

“What’s going on, Pete?” Dad asked, gently. I think he knew I was afraid. 

“John's acting funny,” I said. “He went downstairs.”

After exchanging apprehensive expressions, my parents went to find John. They didn't know I followed closely behind them or that I felt very scared this had everything to do with D&D and the man with the moustache on the commercial. 

We found John sitting on the floor, his nose close to the black TV screen. None of the lights were on. Shadows filled his eye sockets.

I clutched the belt of Mom's housecoat. She nearly leapt out of her skin, and gave me a stern look before pulling me under her arm.

“John?” my dad asked.

My brother slowly turned his head. His eyes were shut. “The man with the moustache on the commercial,” he droned before lifting his hand to point at the basement door. 

Almost at the same moment, a high pitched scream came from below, neither male nor female. That level of anguish is genderless. 

My dad put himself between us and the basement door.

John's eyes snapped open. Mom pulled him close and kept me firmly entwined in her left arm.

Dad went to the kitchen for his weapon of choice, the trusty black slugger behind the fridge. He had its twin upstairs beside his bed.

“Go upstairs. Bring Matthew to our room. Stay together. Lock the door. I'll call the police.” Mom pulled us so fast, it felt like I flew. Matthew stayed asleep and fed while John and I stood guard inside with her. As the oldest, it was John's right to claim the bat. If he fell, however, it was my responsibility to take it up and avenge him. 

It didn't seem too long before dad knocked at the door. “It's me. Open up. Everything's fine.” John nodded for me to open the door. Dad could be under threat, so I would open it, and John would leap to his rescue, if it were required. 

Fortunately, it was not. Yet, we could see Dad's fear as plainly as the sweat on his skin. His smile took effort. “Nothing in the basement.” 

“Did the police come?” Mom asked.

“Go to bed, boys,” he said. “Everything's fine. It was nothing.”

Neither of us believed him. We'd all heard that scream. But we obediently went to our bunks with no intention of sleeping. Our house was so small. Nothing spoken remained a secret. I don't think my parents know how loud they really are.

I'll strip the extraneous from their overheard conversation. The key takeaway came from d
Dad.

“I didn't call the police.”

“Why?”

“Because we need a priest.” He said “priest” but he meant pastor. Pentecostals don't have priests. Just pastors in regular clothes. 

The next evening we were sent to our rooms after supper. We didn't argue. We knew the guest coming was a pastor from the church. Not the senior pastor but the other guy, a junior, I guess? 

With the sun still up, and our nerves about to exit our flesh, John and I listened for the pastor's arrival. Our parents admitted him, offered him coffee, which he politely declined, and led him to the basement.

I recognized every noise in every stair. They must have been down there for less than a minute before we heard a rush of footsteps to the kitchen.

“I'm afraid,” the pastor said, his voice shaky, “this is quite serious.”

“Do you think it's-”

“Do not name it!” the pastor warned. He laughed nervously after. “Sorry, I need to call Pastor Shepherd. I know they sent me, but… I have to tell you… this is, uh, my first time… and… um…” He trailed off incoherently. 

Also, Shepherd really was the senior pastor's name. I didn't change it. 

Our parents came upstairs later with a box of Tim Horton's donuts and milk. It wasn’t a bribe but it certainly didn't hurt their chances of us following their instructions. Tim Hortons in the 80s was freaking top notch; they actually made their donuts at the store in those days and they were huge. I felt guilty for enjoying them. If only we hadn't switched the channel…

“The pastor has some work to do,” Dad said, “and he will be here through the night. Pray for him. And don't leave your room. No matter what, okay?”

We agreed. He called us “good boys” and left. I looked at John. He knew I wanted to tell them what we'd done. He just shook his head and went to his bunk. 

I tried to busy myself with toys, some books, and finally cleaning. If I could do something good, like tidying up, then maybe it would make up a little for my transgression.

Hours dragged. John rolled over to face the wall and seemed to be asleep. It finally got dark out. I stood by the window and watched the street. I'm not sure how long before I heard the front door of our house open. 

The pastor strode quickly through the streetlight, his hands jammed into his coat pockets. He quickly walked out of sight along the sidewalk, looking back once as if to check for someone following. 

His departure made me afraid. The hurried exit looked a lot like retreat. Whatever thing might be in the basement had defeated him, and we were, once again, on our own against the forces of evil.

All because of me. John too, of course, but he had given in to temptation first. It was my responsibility to pick up what he had lost, and I had failed. That meant, in my little head, too old for my age, that I must solve the problem.

I took my pocket sized King James bible from my underwear drawer. Pentecostals have no particular bible of their own. Next, I found the 2x2 piece of wood my father had carved a point on - my sword. Last, I took the tiny flip knife on John's dresser. Yes, I didn’t ask to borrow it but I figured he would have loaned it to me given the circumstances.

Lifting the handle of my bedroom door to prevent the hinges from protesting my exit, I left my room, deftly avoiding the major reactionary noises of the hardwood floor. It was late. All the bedroom doors, except my own, were closed. 

I crept downstairs and saw the basement had been left open. A dim light pushed at the darkness of the first landing. One of the three dangling light bulbs had been left on. The cowardly pastor had neglected to switch it off during his flight.

Right now, I write as if I wasn't deathly afraid, like some idyllic crusader about to earn redemption through holy resolve. But I was just a kid, and I didn't want to go down there. I wanted to go to bed and wake up on the Saturday morning before Mom had fallen asleep on the couch. 

The trick to the basement stairs was walking on the sides of each worn step. I didn't make a sound and landed on the concrete floor like a cat. So focused on where I stepped, I didn't see my colossal error.

The pastor had never left.

His white sleeves were rolled up to the bicep. 

He wasn't looking at me. I saw his back. He looked for something but not very hard. I knew what came next. Yet, trying to run away was exactly the cause of his swift turn and approach. I accidentally kicked a box with my foot and alerted him to my presence.

The speed with which he moved seemed unnatural because I took my eyes off him for a moment. Then he was there, very close to my face, and grasping my shoulders.

“Who do we have here?”

I shut my eyes, and he immediately released me.

“Whoops, sorry,” he said, “sometimes I forget not everyone wants me in their personal space.” I opened my eyes and he was still a bit too close, so I took a step back. His blue eyes weren’t cold; they were worried. His smile was false, but it was for a reason. He wanted to pretend everything was alright. “You should go back up to bed. Pretty sure your dad told you not to come out of your room, pal.” The pastor appeared more and more uncomfortable, grasping his elbows.

“My dad?” I asked, bewildered and confused, a six-year-old boy.

The man with the moustache cleared his throat. “He needed a break. I sent him to the 7-11 for cigarettes. I’ve been trying to quit. Wrong time to quit.” After another prolonged, awkward moment, he noticed my armaments. “Why are you down here, Peter?”

I held out the bible. I don’t know why. Before he could finish reaching for it, an invisible fire rippled across my chest. The pain was so sudden and intense, I screamed like never before. It felt like hot knives were crisscrossing my ribs. 

The shriek I’d heard the night of John’s sleepwalking didn’t sound exactly like the one I’d belted. But it wouldn’t, would it? It’s the difference between the voice you hear when you speak and when you hear it on recording. 

I whimpered and struggled to remove my shirt. The pastor knelt down and helped it off. He didn’t ask what was wrong. He seemed to know already.

“Pray Peter, pray,” he encouraged me. I tried but the pain got worse and worse with each word. “Don’t stop, Peter.”

“It…hurts…”

The pastor prayed, “Dear God, please help this child.” He held me down to the floor to stop my writhing. “In the name of Jesus Christ, leave this child alone!” At once, the pain ended. We smiled at one another. I started to laugh, but he still couldn’t flush all the worry from his expression. 

And then the real tragedy began.

My dad came down the basement stairs. He stared at the man with the moustache and dropped the cigarettes and lighter where he stood.

“Go upstairs, Peter.”

“Dad, I-”

“Upstairs,” he said, and I knew that tone. It meant, “Right away or else.”

The man with the moustache recognized what the scene looked like - him overtop of a shirtless six-year-old and smiling - even if I didn’t. “Uh, things are not what they seem.” He stood up and backed away, patting the front of his pants. “I don’t think we’re quite done here either. Your son was attacked by it…”

Dad let the pastor’s words die in a prolonged silence, while he waited for me to scramble away. I ran to the top floor and all the doors, except mine, were shut. Mom had woken up but the shriek was not unexpected. The pastor had been called in for a reason after all. John sat on the edge of his mattress. 
“Why’d you have to change the channel?!” I wailed. John just apologised and knew why he should. He shouldn’t have done it. I shouldn’t have let him. Our thoughts never strayed from the cartoon failure.

The man with the moustache nearly died from the beating he took. Dad intended to kill him. Mom sensed something wrong aside from the suspected infernal presence. She interrupted the attempted murder, but not before the pastor was toothless and disfigured. I guess Dad’s anger lessened enough for his brain to understand he couldn’t go to jail. My parents put the pastor into the car and took him to the hospital. 

He apparently regained consciousness and didn’t contradict my Dad when he lied about a car accident. Mom and Dad didn’t stay to see what happened next. The man survived. No charges or questions followed. 

We stopped going to church. No cartoons, henceforth, were forbidden. 

I didn’t understand. I was happy. 

I didn’t know until much later. 

But I don’t want to digress from my family just yet and what ensued after that night. The months and years progressed and John and I grew apart. He developed an interest in our old, dusty basement, and started hanging out down there a lot. 

“Want to see a ghost?” he asked me once. 

I never wanted to go down there again. Unexplained burning knives is a pain you don’t forget. So John went alone, eventually moving his bed and dresser down there when he turned thirteen. No, the basement never got finished, but he made it somewhat more comfortable with a carpet he’d found on the side of the road, and a TV. He played violent video games and listened to heavy metal.

“Terrible music,” Mom said with a shrug.

“Just a phase,” Dad said.

They’d been so thoroughly gutted of their faith.

John didn’t like me or any of his siblings anymore. He chased us away whenever we asked to play his Super Nintendo. I saw the drugs once when I snuck in; I think I was fourteen. Before I could run away and tell our parents, he caught me and twisted my arm until I agreed not to say anything. 

“It’s just weed,” he said, but there were needles. Yet again, I didn’t understand. A fourteen-year old’s drug knowledge should be limited.

John died of an overdose shortly after being kicked out of the house. He was twenty-five, and never graduated high school or had a job for long. No friends, girlfriends, or acquaintances attended his funeral because he’d made no strong relationships throughout his short life. 

And the saddest part, for me, was that nobody cried at his funeral. John had become so unlike his childhood self, so troubled, so violent, I think Mom and Dad and everyone were relieved he was gone for good this time. 

From that relief came extreme levels of guilt for my parents. Mom went to church again, but Dad refused. They fought over it. Combined with the tragedy of their eldest son, they soon split up. 

It was all so much to process. I just didn’t for the longest time. What may seem like an obvious chain of causation to the day Mom fell asleep on the couch didn’t occur to me until I saw him again - what was left of him that is.

The man with the moustache on the commercial, in our house, doing his best to help six-year-old me, is confined to a wheelchair; he can’t move it on his own. 

His attendant pushed him to the edge of an apple bin at the grocery store and whispered softly, “these ones today, Pastor. Mash up real good. Use the blender.” It was a one-sided conversation. 

He stared at nothing, but I could never forget those blue eyes. 

All because we’d watched the wrong cartoon and something - [something bad](https://www.reddit.com/u/APCleriot/s/sGBEGHr5kl) - had given us a glimpse of the future
