So, I was on YouTube watching a wendigo video about kidnappings.
I got to reading the comments section after the video and had a memory of a creepy experience return to me. 

I'm 28 now, when I was 17-18 I worked at a bakery, it was my first job. I didn't drive and it was a 20-30 minute walk to work every morning to be there by 2am.

Iived in a sort of small small town back then too. There was this one morning where at some point during my walk to work, I heard the sound of a car nearby,
it was quiet but it was so early, that it was veeeery easy for me to notice. I was used to dead, serene silence.

It didn't have it's headlights on, and seemed to be following me.
I remember looking to the car multiple times to see if it was the same car, while it was dark, yes, I could make out that it was the same car, there was not a single other car out. There never was at that time.

It cruised sloooowly behind me, I can't honestly recall for how long, but I had eventually tried to take a different turn and speeding up, and it turned as I turned. It followed as I walked. I had the eeriest, most unsettling feeling. My gut told me something was wrong.

I pulled out my mobile phone and pretended to talk to someone, thinking maybe that would spook them somehow, eventually, it stopped following me.

I told my co workers and boss, and they took it very seriously, my boss urged me to buy a bicycle, he even offered to gift me one. (I politely decline his generous offer)

That same car was there again, for the next couple of days, around the same spot, and would follow me again until a certain point. 

I could tell it was the same car, even in the darkness, it's shape, and its lack of using headlights. 

I continued to tell my boss and co workers at the time, aswell as a support worker I knew who would check up on me time to time, as I was previously living in a homeless refuge, and had transferred/graduated to some youth off the street, housing program.

My support worker drove me to get a bicycle the day I told him. It was a cheap one from a junkyard/rubbish place that also had a second hand store.

I couldn't avoid going past the spot the car would usually start following me, but for whatever reason, it stopped showing up, I never saw it again. 
I guess I never needed the bike after all, but I did use it every day from then on.

It could have been nothing, it could have just been a coincidence, but it felt wrong, my gut was telling me so. The 2 or so mornings after the first time I saw the car were dreaded and I was genuinely afraid and unsettled. I don't usually get that kind of instinctual gut feeling of "something isn't right, your in danger". But I certainly did then.
