I'm saying that I've first hand seen it yes, but it was only because of a cataclysmic event that happened in California when there was an earthquake.
You probably think I'm fucking crazy and making up some bogus story but the truth of the matter is  that an Earthquake triggered a doorway to be opened and the earthquake cracked the earth.
I somehow slipped through the crack into this other worldly place and as I was traveling the whole view was obstructed with what looked like some optical illusion black and white spiral, which I would assume was a portal being utilized by "them" which I will explain who "they" are...

You've probably heard of cryptids, humanoids, other things that don't seem plausible..
But I remember after the spiral it felt like I hit the ground and I was greeted with this reptillian grotesque figure that looked like a mixture of an alligator and komodo dragon that was walking, while talking in an indecipherable language to the human ear, but telepathically was speaking to me in English.
This being had claws that could extend and impale anyone, which is extremely painful, it felt like the creature was trying to take my soul, but I fought it off.

The whole surface and terrain was what appeared to be a cave or some tyoe of cavern that was built underground with an awful stench that reeked of death, rotting bodies, rotten eggs, and just all the fulness of anything imaginable, and also people were screaming begging for help but none of their cries were heard. It was the worse feeling of utter dread and hopelessness that I've ever felt, as if my stomach had the feeling of sickness as if I was going to vomit up and hurl but nothing would be vomited.

So I then communicated with them somehow explaining that I didn't belong there wherever the place was and that there must have been some sort of mistake, well they seemed insulted because of my belief and ability to communicate.. which is why they led me to an open area that was full of magma and lava that resembled a volcano but looked like the core of the earth.
Upon arriving to this area they told me to jump into the magma/lava/core, and initially I said no, but they explained it was the only way out and when I turned around I seen some reptillian figure that had the head of Medusa with snakes and metal spiked thorns in its head connected to what looked like blades with the face that resmebled some tyoe of baphomet with blood allover its body pulsating like the blood was keeping it alive and it was a very devilish figure that just gave the sense of utter dread and hopelessness..
Best way I can describe it was that the figure was the embodiment of death, pain, and suffering.
So, I was like fuck this shit and jumped, felt a severe burning sensation and then blinked and was back to Earth.

None of this was drug induced this was an accurate depiction of what had happened.
Not sure how to make sense of any of this other than what I've researched and added to the title of this thread.

What are your alls thoughts?
