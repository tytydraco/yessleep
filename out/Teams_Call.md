It was late, far past working hours, but Alex had one last Teams meeting to attend. The invite had come from an unfamiliar address, marked as "Urgent." With a sigh, he clicked the link and joined the call. The screen flickered to life, revealing a grid of darkened, featureless windows. Only his own face was visible, bathed in the cold glow of the monitor.

"Hello?" he called out, but the only response was a faint, crackling static. He checked the participants list—dozens of names, all unrecognizable, all marked as 'present.' A shiver ran down his spine, but he shrugged it off, attributing it to fatigue.

Minutes ticked by, and no one spoke. Frustrated, Alex tried to leave the call, but the button to hang up was grayed out, unresponsive. He clicked it repeatedly, each attempt more frantic than the last. His computer froze, and the screen glitched momentarily before returning to the same, eerie silence.

"Is anyone there?" he demanded, his voice quivering. Suddenly, one of the dark windows flickered, and a face appeared—pale, gaunt, and expressionless. The figure's eyes locked onto his, unblinking.

"You can't leave," the figure whispered, the voice distorted and hollow. "You joined us."

Alex's heart raced. He tried to shut down his computer, but the power button didn't respond. He reached for the power cord, intending to pull it from the wall, but it felt like it was welded in place. Panic set in.

More windows flickered to life, each revealing a similarly haunting face. They all stared at him, their eyes empty, their mouths moving in silent incantations. The static grew louder, filling his ears with a relentless, droning hum.

"Let me out!" Alex screamed, banging on his keyboard, but his words were swallowed by the cacophony of static and whispers. The faces began to chant in unison, their voices merging into a single, bone-chilling word: "...Stay."

The room around him seemed to fade, the walls dissolving into darkness. The only light came from the screen, now a portal to another realm where the faces grew closer, their features more defined and terrifying. They reached out to him, their hands stretching impossibly through the screen.

Desperate, Alex grabbed his phone to call for help, but it too was dead, the screen black. He was trapped, not just in the call, but in his own home, now transformed into a prison of shadows and whispers.

The chant grew louder, the faces pushing through the screen, surrounding him. His vision blurred, his consciousness slipping away. The last thing he saw was his own reflection in the monitor, his face now pale and gaunt, eyes vacant. He noticed his reflection in the monitor repeating the chant “stay… stay…” but when he went to feel his mouth he felt nothing.

When Alex's friends and colleagues tried to reach him the next day, there was no response. His apartment was found empty, his computer screen shattered, the remnants of a long-ended Teams call flickering on the monitor. Alex was gone, vanished without a trace.

But sometimes, late at night, if you join a Teams call and listen very closely, you might hear his voice, faint and desperate, whispering "*Let me out...*"
