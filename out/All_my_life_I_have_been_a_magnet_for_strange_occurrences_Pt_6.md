Cult.


I use this word allegorically. 


But by definition, the word’s meaning reigns true. 


At some point it became apparent, but throughout my childhood it was always present. Despite my early proclivities, there were many incidents of disillusion. For when it became truth, when I was met with true Gods, spirits, and angels they told me the truth. 


These truths were blasphemous though and I knew even at my young age to keep quiet. 


Covered in Catholicism, our head of the family served as supreme matriarch, self appointed prophet. 


My blood runneth full of the blood of Shamans Of The Isle, of which I consider myself in my young adult years. I was guided along my path by those who run in my blood, that much I know. That is not to say there is no power in Catholicism, but my path does not follow the one that leads to Jesus although we do speak on various occasions. The thing about being polytheistic is believing in all whether you follow them or not. 


I know a few things despite the dissolutions that occurred through accidental coaching of a young child thanks to the matriarch believing themselves to have visions from God himself. I know that I often became confused, unable to distinguish whether a person was deceased or not. I was visited often by Angels and shown things that would have me burned at the stake back in the day. I saw and met my ancestors, knew when family members would pass, and I have always had consistent and uncanny 


Déjà-Vu…


No. 


Déjà-rêvé. 


Waking. Brilliant familiarity. 


I dreamed it and it happened. I at least knew how to avoid the bad ending. 


When Michael the Angel came to me in a dream and showed me the truth. 


The dream began with me walking down a beige hallway. I turned a corner and met a tall man. He was dressed like a Roman guard, sword on his hip and massive white feathered wings with blue and greens peppering the tips of the feathers. He had wavy honey-blonde hair and blue eyes with flecks of gold and green. He was well built in figure, muscular and he had soft but handsome facial features. Despite his intimidating figure, he was kind and gentle in expression, action and speech. 


He held out his hand to me and I took it, looking up at him. I don’t think we spoke, I simply knew inherently it was him and he was he. 


He lead me through a door and he spoke gently,”I’m going to show you something *****.” 


He used my preferred name at the time, a nickname I still use.My family always used it as well over my long name. I gave a nod and he stepped aside, motioning to reveal a wall covered in paintings. He asked me to choose one and I picked. Each one revealed a brilliant vision, as if I were teleported into them and each one revealed a truth about the stories of the good book. Lucifer was a wayward child, Jesus was a prophet, and God didn’t care anymore. We were too far gone, too lost in the void. 


In between visions I remember the skylight of the octagonal cream-colored room. I don’t remember the sky but I remember the light and the warm glow of the sun. Between visions and was Michael moved and gestured, small feathers fell loose and floated among the oxygen like twinkling day stars. My fingers instinctively reached to try and play amongst the stray fluff, finding one to twirl with between visions. 


How do I know it’s real? That’s probably what you’re asking. 


I don’t. 


I can’t say whether any of this is, I am myself an unreliable narrator as established. That’s for you to decide. 


All I know is when I awoke, curled in my small fingers was the same white feather.
