It all started in a sunday night when I was asleep. I remember to have a strange dream about me and some guys that I don't know in a cemetery, we were running and laughing of someone. We seemed to be good friend with each other. It was a dark night, no moon at the sky, no stars, only black. One of these guys in my dream joked about we break into a tomb that we found, it seemed a bad ideia, and we discussed for a minute about it, but the guy that had the idea seemed confident and persistent to do it. After a little discussion we made it. I was the first one to start digging. We were all laughing and have fun doing this.

Suddenly I woke up. I opened my eyes scared about that dream, like it was someone looking at me. My room was dark, but the streets lights lightened my room a little bit.  And when I looked around my room I saw at my closet door a child girl. Se was tall, short blond hair, really fat, using a pink old dress and her face was terrible. She had dark circles around her eyes, her mouth was totally black and opened, like her jaw was broken. She has dark scars all over her face. Her dress had holes and it was really dirt. She seemed in decomposition. I looked into her face for long seconds and I thought about still dreaming. But when I close my eyes again her face still in my head and my eyes opened automatically and she still in my room.I start to feel cold, like the temperature was going down. Her face looked mad. I tried to close my eyes again but it opened, and again and again. It looked like she wanted me to see her. It was her way to say that this was not a dream.

I calmed down, take a deep breath and get up my bed to turn on the light. Looking at the floor, I was not confident to look at her face again. I was scared, freezing cold, I knew it was real, she was there in my room. I started to felling like the air was heavy, harder to breathe. And when I turned the light on, suddenly she's gone.  I didn't feel cold anymore. I keep my lights on for the rest of that night. Her face didn't leave my head. The feeling of someone looking at me was present since the moment that I woke up. I didn't sleep again that night.
That's was probably the most scariest thing that happened to me. I ask to myself, the tomb we break in on my dream... It was her's?
