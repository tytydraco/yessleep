 I'm hoping that anyone here would remember or know what had happened that day. It's kinda hard to believe but I would like to explain. 

A couple of days ago my family had a little get-together. I was talking to my older sisters about old childhood experiences and memories we had. We talked about how we played in the rain, stayed out all night playing and pretending we were camping in the front yard, and even stole ice cream from the neighbor's ice cream truck cause he left the window open every night. 

 Until my oldest sister brought something up that piqued our minds, she asked if we remembered that bright flash that happened on the fourth of July back in 2006. We looked at her confused and troubled to remember that day until she started to tell from what she remembered. 

   My dad was driving up to downtown on I-45 going northbound on the southern part of Houston. We parked at the side of the freeway with the other parked cars just to see the fireworks about to shut up. Then out of nowhere, a bright flash appeared and she just remembered waking up from her bed feeling lightheaded and bewildered by what had happened the night before. 

  My second oldest later added more to the story from her perspective. Like the cars making a ton of traffic just to see the fireworks. Also, she heard a high-pitched but heavy drumming noise before the flash. But when she woke up the next day she felt sick even vomiting.

  They ended the conversation as just a small hangover we did as kids. Probably eating or drinking a lot of junk food. But I knew there was more to that because from what I remembered was more into the bizarre and the unexplainable. I didn't say anything cause they might find me crazy or think that I'm just adding a dumb fantasy. 

  It flooded back to me like my own mind locking down into my mental vault but now escaped and reminded me what had happened. From what I'm about to say may seem like some episode of the X-files. Please believe me, even if it sounds like a dumb sci-fi story be open-minded.

 From what I remember was the same. We pull to the side of I-45 just to see the fireworks with other sightseers. My dad carried me above his shoulders just to get a better view of the fireworks. I looked around the area hoping to see at least one shoot up.  I hear people talking in wondering when will the show begin. But more of the voices started to sound more curious and fearful than wondering. Someone yells out “What is that?” which causes my dad to turn around to see the direction everyone is looking.

  In the sky probably about 400 feet in the air was a triangle-shaped craft. It was all chromed out but with a blackout line around the corners darker even the night. It was most likely about 60 to 70 feet long, 50 to 60 feet wide, and 10 feet high. It stood still not moving and then another about a quarter mile away was hovering. They were both the same. It blasted a loud high-pitched boom that made every cover their ears. When it stopped I could hear the people begin to sound afraid. Even saw others going back into their vehicles. People begin to point out they're there are more in different positions.

  That's when the bright flash made me blind feeling a sharp sting. Same like my sisters I woke up in my bed feeling sick and lightheaded. Confused and disoriented I tried to remember but couldn't. I shrugged it off as my sisters felt the same even my parents for they felt the same and all agreed we just went a little overboard the night before.

 I know there has to be more that happened that night. If you had the same experience or even roughly remember please comment about it. I don't feel comfortable about this but I need to know if other people remember that night. Thank you for your time and please reach out.
