Content Warning: body horror

So I have been living with my roommate, Julie for almost a year. She's generally a pretty good roommate, cleans after herself and mind her own business. Every Sunday evening, she goes to church and comes back on Monday morning to get dressed for work. She invited me a few times but I always said no because I like having my Sunday evenings to dread Monday mornings.

Last week, i went to my mother's funeral. She died of cancer but the upside of her dying of cancer, is that it was expected. It didn't make it hurt less but it was something I was prepared for. I spent Saturday at home in my room, crying and trying not to have a breakdown. When Sunday rolled around, I was feeling a little better. Julie saw me, tired with tear stains on my face and felt pity. 

“Eve… I'm really sorry about your mom… if you want to talk, I'm going to church soon. We can talk on the ride and you can maybe find help in prayer” Julie suggested, her words felt genuine. I couldn't help but go along, my other option was to stay home and throw myself around until Monday. 

“... okay” was all I could bring myself to say, it was hard to speak after a day of bawling my eyes out. 

Soon, I was already in the car, my eyes on the road. I wasn't driving but what else was there to look at. Houses, trees, other cars, it was all just a waste.

“Why don't ya tell me about your mom?” She said, trying to get some conversation from me. I think by the immediate frown on my face, she understood I wasn't ready yet.

“How about I tell you about my church? Would ya like to hear about it?” She asked, her southern accent coming out. I always found it nice, it reminded me of my mom. I nod my head, just wanting to hear how she said words, caring less about what words she said.

“Well, there's our pastor, Charlie. Guides our prayer, reads verses, gives bread. We're Christians but we understand the bible more than Roman Catholics do. We know how to read between the lines, really capture God's image.” at the time, I didn't really understand what she was talking about but I didn't care. It sounded more like home and that was enough for me.

“We're here!” she said cheerfully. I looked around confused, there was no building or really even a path. We were just on an off road surrounded by forests, parked in the bushes.

“Come on, it's just a little walk in the forest. I promise it'll be just fine” I already regretted my decision to go with her but I can't drive and she's my way home. I get out of the car reluctantly, I didn't even look at her.

“Alright, let's go pumpkin.” She threw her arm over my shoulder and walked me into the woods. Her words hit me like a truck, she knew the word pumpkin brought back memories for me.

“Oh no I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. It just slipped out, I'm sorry” she apologized as she saw the tears in my eyes building up. She wiped my tears and hugged me.

“It's alright, I'm real sorry. I don't like seeing people cry” she said as I pulled away and wiped my tears in my sleeve. 

“It's okay, Julie. I'm fine” I said, not wanting any more comfort from her. After that, the walk in the forest was quiet, she didn't dare say a word to me but led me through the trees. As the evening turned into night, I was starting to get tired. I squint my eyes and grab Julie's arm.

“Are we lost?” I ask, fear in my eyes. She shook her head and pointed ahead, I could see a faint fire burning. I sighed and nodded, continuing to walk. It was already dark and the fire acted as a beacon. 

Once we could see the embers coming off the flame, I could see the people. Everyone was sitting on the floor, with who I assume was Charlie standing in front of them. Sat away from the fires, Charlie's face was the only one lit and honestly he was the only thing to see, besides the trees near him. Charlie was a bald man with a robe, unlike the rest of us who wear casual clothes.

“Welcome Eve, Julie has told us about you and we are happy to have you here at our lovely service.” I didn't like that out of the twenty or so people who were here, I was the only new one. I just nodded my head, trying to get the attention away from me.

“In the name of the father, the son and the Holy spirit, amen” as the words left the pastor's mouth, I felt a surge of electricity go through me, my eyes closed and my head bowed. I didn't move them into that position, I was forced. 

Then I saw… God, it's body was beyond me. I was still in the forest but above the trees I could see bits and pieces of its body. I saw its redish, spongey hand move over me. I couldn't see it's face behind the tall trees but I heard it, it slushed, like jello. 

I opened my eyes during the prayer in fear, I tried to reach for Julie who I thought was next to me but she wasn't. I couldn't see properly, like the fire wasn't as bright. I couldn't tell who was Julie, the only person i could see was Charlie. His face was distorted and looked wet and shiny.

“Julie?” I said interrupting the prayer. Charlie looked at me and smiled too big. His new face smiled with every muscle, it was covered in smooth organ like bumps. his smile looks more like a pit opening than a mouth.

“Something wrong Eve?” Charlie stopped the prayer, he didn't speak with his mouth, leaving the open abyss of his mouth to stare back at me.

“No. I'm sorry” I said frantically, my hands shakingly going back to resting on my lap. I didn't want to ask more questions in fear of drawing more attention to myself. I looked around and all the others were praying to themselves, their whispers layered over each other. I tried to close my eyes hoping that he'd continue with the service. 

After a few seconds of everyone else but Charlie talking, I opened my eyes. He was standing in front of me, bent at the hip and face to face with me. His weird organ covered face inches away from mine. I could see every bump and texture on his face, the slimy coloured sweat that dripped from his face and his open ‘mouth’. It was like a void in his face, it opened wider and wider.

“Something wrong, Eve?” He repeated himself, his mouth still not moving to speak but now I was sure the voice came from him. It was louder this time, the sound powered through the whispers of the other's prayers. In fear, I shook my head no and tried not to stare at the gapping nothingness in his mouth.

“Talk to us, Eve. We can make you feel better” he spoke again, his mouth now wide enough to fill my vision. I closed my eyes, I didn't know what else to do. 

The image of God's gross hand reaching closer to me, its skin clear in the fire. Tongues, it had taste buds all over its arm. I saw a drop of blood ready to fall on me and I was so scared I didn't want any liquid from that thing on me. I opened my eyes and Charlie was in front of everyone again. The whispering prayers quiet down as they all open their eyes to look at him. They all looked at him like he was normal, like his face wasn't nauseating to look at.

“Let us talk of our beloved mother, Mary. A virgin of virgins. As the Bible speaks of her vision of Jesus, I speak the truth” He spoke with power, his gaping mouth still wide open. It wasn't growing like before but it was still too big. 

“Amen” they all said in unison. I was confused, that's not how a call and response goes but I don't want to question them.

“Mary was shown a vision not of angels but of god. Our beloved God, so full of love, opened its chest and tore out his heart. He ripped open Mary's mouth and fed her his beating heart. To give Jesus his love" His words felt disgusting to hear.

“Amen,” the other's responded.

“He peeled off his skin to give Jesus his face” He continued. His mouth now drooling, it wasn't blood thank goodness but his same sweat. 

“Amen,” this congregation will say that for anything.

“He fed mother Mary his sweat, for Jesus's blood. The word of the Lord as he said” I nearly gagged but didn't want to interrupt in fear of what they would do. 

“Thanks be to God's word” this was sacrilege at this point.

“Now the Eucharist” Charlie's words echoed, his hands raised as six more ‘men’ in robes showed up. I think they were men, they didn't have faces. They had tongues for skin like the giant god in my visions. They had no eyes, no mouths, their heads produced that same coloured sweat. They carried bowls of regular slices of bread. The ‘church’ started to hum like a choir, the song sounded familiar but I could quite get the melody.

Charlie was the first, one of the men walked up to him. His hand dove into the bowl violently, he grabbed the slice so tight, it was more like dough in his fist. He raised it and sounds that felt like attacks on my ears came from him. He quickly shoved the bread in his void, his whole fist disappearing in his pit-like mouth. He pulled it out and his hand was gone, his barron wrist now bleeding. I gasped but not too loud, I don't want him near me now after seeing what his mouth can do.

Within seconds, his bone grew out of his wrist and formed muscle and skin over it. It was very quick but it looked painful, Charlie didn't seem to mind it… I expect this isn't his first time doing that. With a cheer from the crowd, the cloaked men walked with their bowls and kneeled down in front of the people in the front row. I watched as people took the bread and scoffed down their slice. 

When one finally got to me, I shook my head. I tried to be as polite as possible about it. He wasn't satisfied and moved the bowl closer to me

“I never did first communi-” I try to explain, my hand slowly trying to push it away. He quickly shoved the bread in my mouth before I could finish. I could feel slimy sweat dripping down my chin from his hand. Its rough textured skin was squishy and its buds felt like being licked. I nodded and chewed the bread, trying to convince him I was eating. this gave me a good taste of the bread, it was flesh like. It was squishy and soft like meat and tasted of blood, tears started to build up in my eyes. I hated this, I wanted to spit it out but they watched me. They all turned to watch me, Charlie, the tongue men, Julie. Julie's face hurt the most. I don't know why the men turned, they don't have eyes.

I swallowed it down and sobbed, my mouth open as I drooled a mixture of blood and saliva. My tears started dripping down my face, I looked up at them and Charlie was standing in front of me again. His mouth closed in a smile, his face morphing to a more human appearance.

“He chose you” he said, I looked around and no one else had blood in their mouths. They all smiled at me, Julie had a hand to her heart like she was proud. I looked at Charlie, I felt dazed and confused.

“what?” I barely spoke, he grabbed my hand and forced me to stand. 

“God has chosen you, you are like us” he cheered at me and I turned to Julie. She nodded her head and smiled with a thumbs up.

“I don't want this” the thought of being like whatever Charlie or tongue men were, scared me to no end. I tried to leave his grasp but he was far too strong.

“It doesn't matter what you want. God chose you, this is your path” Charlie let me go and smile, I fell to the floor. Julie crawled to me and hugged me.

“Ohh I'm so happy for ya. I wish god would love me like that” Julie's joy was not reciprocated. I pushed her away and started sobbing.

“I wanna go home!” I cried out, my hand on my face as I felt overwhelmed. 

“It's alright pumpkin, it's all over, see” she pointed, I peered through my fingers and the sun was rising. I frowned even more as I started crying harder. Julie wrapped an arm around me as she picked me up and we walked back to the car.

It's been two days and Julie is convinced I'm going to church next Sunday with her even though I refuse to go. I can't sleep because every time I close my eyes, I see God's gross body looming over me. I saw something similar on this sub and I feel like this has to be a crime of some kind. I kinda wanna go back to ask questions, especially about my itchy skin. I've been growing a rash on my arm and it's making my arm very squishy. I'll see if I can keep posting.
