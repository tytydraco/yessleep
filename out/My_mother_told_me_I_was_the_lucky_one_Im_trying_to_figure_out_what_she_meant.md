My mother wasn’t the type to read me stories in bed. From a young age, I was expected to lie quietly in the dark, staring up at the ceiling as I waited for sleep to take me, which is why I was more than a little surprised to see her stumble into my room close to midnight.

From the vague blue glow of streetlights coming through my bedroom window, I could tell it was her, but she smelled different, like ozone and alcohol.

“There he is,” she said. “The lucky one.”

“Huh?” I said.

“I thought you might be having trouble sleeping,” she said, her voice quivering slightly as she spoke. “I thought I might tell you a bedtime story.”

I was twelve years old then, far too old for such things. And even back in elementary school, she wasn’t the sort of mom who put me to sleep with Dr. Seuss or *The Chronicles of Narnia.* The few times I’d snuck out of bed, I’d found her hunched over a crossword puzzle with a cup of tea, dutifully double-checking her answers.

“Okay,” I said quietly.

She breathed in deep. She was staring at me intently. That was something she never did. Most of the time, mom seemed eager to look at anything but me.

*“When you were six,” she began. “You got this cough. No one thought much of it at first. You had a lot of coughs in those days. But then some time went on, and it persisted. A week later, your dad noticed red spots on a tissue and took you to urgent care.*

*At first, doctors thought the x-ray was a simple infection, something that could be treated with antibiotics, but something looked a bit off, so a specialist was consulted. She eventually diagnosed you with a rare form of lung cancer.*

*Several forms of treatment were attempted including a surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy, but in the end it was all in vain. You never went another hour in your life without coughing. Eventually, you died choking to death on your own blood.”*

She rubbed at the bridge of her nose. She seemed to be crying a bit.

“Mom?” I said. “I don’t get it.”

“It’s a horrible story, isn’t it?” she asked. “Sometimes I imagine a horrible thing, and then I blink and I’m back to the present moment, and everything is fine, and I’m so relieved that I just get this serene feeling.”

“Okay,” I said.

“Maybe it’ll help you fall asleep, knowing you’re the lucky one,” she said. “That whole story I just told, it didn’t happen to you. Not really.”

“Yeah,” I said, shifting a bit uncomfortably under the covers. “Maybe.”

She thought for a second.

“Can I tell you one more?” she asked.

I didn’t want her to. If I’m going to be honest, I was starting to feel afraid. There was something off about the way she looked, even the way she sounded. It was definitely my mother’s voice, but it was distorted in some almost imperceptible way, like she’d aged twenty years or spent the whole night screaming.

“Okay,” I said, though it was not okay.

“When you were fourteen, you were walking home from a school dance,” she said.

“I’m not fourteen yet,” I said.

“Please don’t interrupt,” she said, suddenly very serious.

*“When you were fourteen… where was I… The dance. You were walking home, and a very bad man grabbed you. He threw you in the back of a van and stabbed you over and over again, until your blood gushed out of you, and you were whispering for me as the life left your eyes.*

*And then he simply dropped your body in a river where it was never found, and he was never caught, and in fact somewhere, he’s still grabbing people and murdering them quickly and efficiently. And, in fact, he never will be caught. He’ll simply get bored of it all after a few dozen more and go back to his normal life as a truck driver. And as he ages, his mind will start to go, and he’ll convince himself it was all a dream. He’ll deceive himself so convincingly that he won’t even feel guilty anymore. He won’t feel bad at all.”*

She was definitely crying now.

“Mom,” I said. “You’re scaring me.”

“You don’t need to be scared,” she said. “You’re the lucky one, right? You can just think of this story… think of it and then come back to yourself. You’re the lucky little boy in bed, all safe and snuggly, where nothing can hurt you.”

“I think I’d better get to sleep,” I said, instinctively moving away from her. “It’s getting late.”

She put a hand on my ankle. Even through the covers, I could tell that her touch was different. Her grip was stronger than it should have been, and it felt cold through the cotton.

“One more,” she said. “And then you can sleep.”

In the light coming through the window, I saw something glinting in her free hand. It was long and metal. It was hard to tell for sure, but it looked like some kind of blade.

“Is that a knife?” I asked quietly.

“One more story,” she repeated.

I didn’t say a word, which I suppose she took as a yes.

*“When you were just a baby, I didn’t sleep enough. You cried and cried and cried. Your poor mother. You didn’t let me sleep. Your father couldn’t take it either, of course, but he just walked down the hall and slept on the couch. I couldn't do that. I was mom.*

*And then one morning, I woke up and you were cold beside me. Not breathing even a bit. And I had this vague memory of maybe putting a pillow over you in the middle of the night, just to quiet you down. And maybe I held it there a little too long. I was too sleep deprived to really know, of course. Eventually I had to answer a lot of questions from doctors and psychiatrists and such, but finally they just sort of threw their hands up and called it an accident. Maybe it was. But in my heart, I always sort of knew it wasn’t.”*

I felt my heart beating harder now. She hadn’t let go of my ankle the whole time she was telling this final story. The blade glinted in her free hand.

“So why are you the lucky one?” she asked, her voice breaking. “What did you do? Why you?”

“I don’t know,” I said.

“You don’t get it,” she said. “I’ve seen myself a hundred different ways. Sometimes I’m a little fatter, sometimes a little skinnier. Sometimes maybe I’ve dyed my hair. But I’m always alive. I’m not even all that different. But you. You’re always dead. Always. Until this time,” she was breathing harder now, starting to raise her voice. “Why are you so goddamn lucky?”

“Mom!” I screamed, and with that, the woman quickly rose from my bed, straightening her skirt and walked quickly out of the room. “Mom!” I screamed again.

A few seconds later, my mother walked into the room and turned on the light. She was completely normal, dressed in some oversized pajamas, her hair still wet from showering. She looked at me curiously.

“What’s wrong?” she asked.

I tried to find the words, but all I could say was, “I got scared.”

“Don’t be ridiculous,” she said. “There’s nothing to be scared of.” Even in the dark I could tell she was rolling her eyes.

“Could you stay with me,” I asked. “Just for a little bit, until I fall asleep.”

“You’re practically a teenager,” she said. As she spoke, she looked toward my feet and picked something up off the floor. It was a knife, maybe six inches long.

"Where'd you get this?" she asked.

"It isn't mine," I answered quietly.

"You're a liar," she said bitterly. "And a little coward."

For a moment, she looked at the knife thoughtfully, turning it over in the moonlight. Then she took the weapon and left, closing the door behind her and leaving me in the dark. Soon, I heard the scratch of her pencil as she got out her crosswords. I was alone, utterly alone in the dark, and for once, I was glad.

I kept listening to the distant scratching until [I fell asleep.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
