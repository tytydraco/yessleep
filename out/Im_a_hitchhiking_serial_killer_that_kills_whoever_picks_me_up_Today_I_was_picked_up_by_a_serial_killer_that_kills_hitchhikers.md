My name is Claire. I won't bore you with my backstory, or give you tearjerking accounts of past abuse and traumas in an attempt to justify and rationalize the things I've done and continue to do. All you need to know is that I'm a narcissistic, sociopathic psychopath. If human beings were made on an assembly line, I would be a defect, a malfunction.. I'd be stripped for salvageable parts then thrown into a scrap heap. I'm not going to write a thesis paper on what these disorders mean. Just know I have no feelings. I don't have guilt, shame or remorse. I don't have empathy. I definitely don't have sympathy. Your morals, your sense of "right and wrong" are completely alien to me. I've seen what these emotions look like on normal people. I can see them but I can't comprehend them.. It's like a completely colorblind person reading about what the color "red" looks like. They can read about it, but they'll never truly know what it is. Everyday I'm an actress, I masquerade as a functioning person who belongs in society, emulating what I think emotions are supposed to look like. Everyday is Halloween. I deserve an academy award. 

Apart from the murder. I've lived my life as a con artist, drug dealer, pimp and identity thief. I'm also a pretty good amateur chemist, which helped immensely in the drug dealing. I can cook meth that would put you on Pluto. The chemistry is also my primary means of incapacitating people before I string them up from the ceiling, bleed them out into a bucket, and take a sponge bath in the blood. It's really good for the skin, you should try it! I have a net worth of 3.6 million dollars, and that number should continue to climb much higher. I launder all my ill gotten gains into fake shell corporations and then re-transfer funds into the stock market. I've been an extremely successful investor, probably due to my IQ being off the charts. I'm in my early 30's but I look much younger. I'm beyond attractive. My looks are very useful in my hitchhiking hobby, but ultimately wasted on me personally. I've never been in a relationship because I despise intimacy. I also have no sex drive.. In fact, I'd call it a negative sex drive. If you try to touch me in that way, I will peel your face off and wear it as a hat while I watch Netflix.

Now back to my favorite hobby.. I travel around the country hitchhiking. I kill one or two people then head to a different state. Wash, rinse, repeat. My body count is 28 so far. Law enforcement and the FBI are absolutely clueless.. The random nature of the murders, the constant switching of locations, and leaving no trace of a body, make it impossible for them to connect the dots. I've never been remotely on their radar.. In fact, I have no criminal record whatsoever. It's ridiculously easy to evade them in any criminal undertaking. I'm just too smart. And lets face it, anyone who wants a career as cop or a fed, wasn't going to cure cancer in the first place.. There are no Nobel Laurates who have "Law Enforcement" on their resume. I muddy the waters SO much I'll never be caught. When I go to a new state I change my hair color, my eye color.. I wear different sets of facial prosthetics to throw off any cameras capable of facial recognition, or just cameras in general. I usually research where surveillance/street/toll booth cameras are and avoid them, but you can never be too careful. 

My signature move, the thing I'm most proud of, is that before dumping the bodies in muriatic acid and dissolving them without a trace, I cut off their finger tips and put them in separate labeled containers with the victim's name. It serves as both a utility and a trophy of sorts. On every new murder I will take out a container and put a previous victim's prints all over the new victim's car, along with some hairs and blood. This leads to an investigative wild goose chase, where a missing person is now a primary suspect in someone else's disappearance. And the case goes absolutely nowhere. Ha! Ha! This is "comedy" to me.. I find it highly amusing. In addition to the finger tips being trophies, I also collect the victims missing persons reports, any internet articles or news videos.. Most times I will videotape the kill, and subsequent blood bathing as a video souvenir. I keep all this on an encrypted thumb drive which I store in a safety deposit box. I was thinking once I get to 30 bodies I will take a prolonged hiatus. With all the videos, I can re-live the experiences. This will satisfy any urges during my period of inactivity. I think I might taunt the police as well. Maybe FedEx them a finger tip, or e-mail the FBI agent in charge of one of my cases a kill video.. Of course I will email it via the darknet + proxy chaining, and connected to a public Wi-Fi. Maybe I'll send them coded messages like the Zodiac killer.. That sounds quite fun..

The title of my post may be slightly misleading. I'm selective. I don't necessarily kill EVERYONE who gives me a ride. I have parameters, a protocol, a code if you will. If YOU picked me up, were nice to me, and gave me a ride because you simply wanted to help a stranger. You live. Now with that being said, if you pick me up and I sense "ANY" hint of an ulterior motive, you will find yourself hanging upside down in a motel room or a rented storage unit with your mouth and eyes superglued shut. 

When I say ANY ulterior motive, I mean it. Many of the ulterior motives I encounter are sexual or at least romantic in nature. But not all of them.. If you picked me up because you want me to help you clean your entire garage in exchange for a cheeseburger. You disappear. If you picked me up because you wanted to talk to me about the amazing life I can have if I just join the church of latter day saints, you disappear. One time a woman picked me up because she needed a last minute babysitter so she could go to an insane clown posse concert.. The new loser boyfriend she was infatuated with, surprised her with a ticket. She didn't even like their music. I'm pretty sure I did her kids a favor by removing Mommy from the planet. I had some idiot wannabe rapper pick me up just so I could listen to his new mix tape. If it was good I might of actually let him live, lol. If you pick me up with kids in the car, it's a no-go, you live by default. You're a moron for picking up complete strangers when you have kids with you, but you live. Also, If I find out my victims have young children, I anonymously finance and setup a college fund for them. I don't kill teenagers, or anyone that looks relatively young. I try to avoid couples, or a situation with more than one vehicle occupant. It gets too messy, literally and figuratively. Lastly, I've mostly killed men. This is not by design. I'm an equal opportunity killer. It's not a feminist stance on my end. Being an attractive woman, this is just what happens. People see a woman hitchhiking, they assume weakness, poverty, desperation, addiction, degeneracy. They attempt predation because of these assumptions. But unbeknownst to them, I'm the fucking predator here.

Ok, now that I've got you up to speed on everything, let's fast forward to today. I'm in Texas. I loathe this state. It's my favorite place to kill people because of how big it is, and nine times out of ten, if you live here, you're a huge piece of shit. I'm dressed like a blonde stoner who is just trying to find her way to the next Phish concert. It's late November and the weather is tolerable. I never come here in the summer, I'd get heat stroke from endlessly walking on main roads and highways here. I usually get picked up fairly quickly, but it's been 2 hours with my thumb out and no one has even slowed down. It's particularly distressing because I forgot to put a few waters in my purse this morning. I just need a ride to the nearest convenience store and down a few Gatorades, that's priority one. My usual shenanigans are on the backburner for now. I walked for about 15 minutes more and began to get agitated. If I don't get a lift in the next 10 minutes I'm just going to have to call an uber. As soon as I reached in my purse for my phone, I heard the sound of a car slowing down behind me.. Yes! there's a fly in the spiderweb.

I looked behind me, and a man in an old white 1980's station wagon had pulled over. He smiled, waved to me, and motioned for me to get in. Right off the bat, before I even got into the car, there was something strange. This station wagon was 100% pristine, MINT.. It's like someone bought it in 1984 and immediately stored it in a hermetically sealed vault, then randomly decided to take it out for a cruise in 2024. Weird, but whatever. The man looked to be in his late 50's/early 60's dressed like a typical Texas shitkicker. Stupid cowboy hat, dark aviator sunglasses and a toothpick in his mouth.. A walking stereotype. I walked over to the passenger door. He had to unbuckle his seat belt and lean way over to crank down the manual window. and unlock the door. "Howdy! Where you headed? the stereotype asked. He sounds exactly like you think he sounds.

"I'm trying to get to Deep Ellum" I replied.

"Jeezum Crow, that's about 80 miles from here!" the man said surprised.

"Yeah I know. Anywhere you could take me in that general direction would be greatly appreciated. I said this while toying with my hair and acting like a distressed school girl. The man stopped leaning over and returned to the driver's seat. I was waiting for him to say it was too far, wish me good luck and then drive off, but he sat there contemplating, moving the tooth pick around in his mouth. 

"You know what, I'm on Vacation. I've got a cousin, Teddy.. He lives near there and he's always bugging me to come visit. It'd be fun to go out there and surprise him! Hop on in." said the station wagon cowboy.

"Thank you so much!" I said as I sat down in the passenger seat, putting my purse down by my feet. The man pulled back on the road and we were off.

"Name's Clint." he said.

"Angel" I replied

"Beautiful name. No offense, but you don't look like an "Angel". He said. 

(You don't know the half motherfucker, keep it up with the backhanded compliments and see where it gets you.) "I don't? What do I look like?" I asked like I was too stupid to be offended.

"I don't know, like a Mee-chelle or a Katie or sumthin." he said.. Now I'm thinking HE'S the one too stupid to realize that was an asshole comment.

"Yeah well, this is the name my momma gave me so.." I said with shrugged shoulders. Silence from him. He had some twangy country bullshit playing on the radio at a low volume.

"Your car looks like it just rolled off the factory floor" I complimented. I wanted to keep him talking. I didn't like him at all. I wanted to give him every ample opportunity to violate my code so I could gleefully open his veins. If I engage in eager conversation, he might get the delusion that I'm interested in him. If he gets false confidence, it could lead to him saying the wrong thing and he's fucked.

He grinned proudly at my comment. "Oh this old thing? I restore cars, any kind of car, doesn't matter. It's a big hobby of mine, and I get some pretty good side cash if I sell 'em. I've got quite a few hobbies though." 

"Wow that's pretty impressive.. If you told me it was brand new I would've believed it. What are your other hobbies?" I asked as if I gave a shit.

"Well I probably don't look like it, but I do painting and sculpture, abstract stuff." He said timidly as if he was expecting me to laugh in his face. 

"That's so cool! Who are your favorite artists? Who are your influences, what's your medium?" I wanted to test him.. In case he was bullshitting me, telling me something he "thinks" I want to hear. By asking this, I'm kind of showing my hand, giving up the dumb girl act. 

"I'd say Basquiat is my favorite. Jeff Koons I like, Dali. Pollock too. Influences? Older darker stuff.. Goya, Hieronymus Bosch, George Grosz.. For mediums, I guess you could call it mixed media." He said this smugly like a hipster would, and I swear he lost his Texas accent for a little bit. But holy shit!? A hick with some culture and depth? I need to stop judging a book by it's cover I guess. I almost instantly changed my mind over this.. Maybe I won't actively bait him into a trap, and just see where things go naturally.

"Hey um.. Do you mind if I stop by my house real quick? I didn't anticipate going to Deep Ellum today, and I'm sure my cousin will invite me to stay with him for a few. I just need to grab a couple things real quick, change of clothes, toothbrush, make sure my fish have enough food. My house is about 15 minutes from here, won't take long.." Clint asked. 

Reasonable request. This has happened twice before. And each time worked out magnificently for me, well.. Actually in once case there were some big hiccups, but still.. I had a secure kill room, I got to sell everything of value in the house. Force them to log into their bank accounts, drain their checking, IRA's and savings, max out all their credit cards, apply for new cards and max those. I make them buy cryptocurrencies with the money, I tumble the coins multiple, multiple times, do some other electronic laundering, and then deposit them into my crypto wallet. Untraceable. The last time this happened I got really brazen when I found out the guy's house was completely paid off and he had no family. I killed him and then actually stayed in the house for two weeks, got a fake goatee, duck tapped my breasts down as flat as I could, dressed up in his suits and sold his house! Easy little $450k. The guy I did this to.. Let's call him "Jeff" would be one of a small handful of kills you normal humans would call "justified". He got me into his house and tried to force him self on me, and beat me when I tried to resist. Actually knocked one of my teeth out. The fucker.. For a minute I thought he might get the best of me. But I managed to get the stun gun out of my purse (I modified it to output waaay more voltage than it's supposed to.) and I fried him like bacon. Normally I don't go out of my way to make people suffer, but in Jeff's case, when he woke up from the electrocution.. I won't go into details, but let's just say I went "medieval on his ass" as Marcellus Wallace would put it. Oh! and I used his actual scalp as a man wig.. You needed to know that right?

"Yeah sure that's fine, makes sense. I'll just hang out in the car though if that's ok." I said in an understanding tone.

"Ok great, it'll be quick.. Hey you look really thirsty. Your lips keep sticking together when you talk. Are you dehydrated or sumthin? Clint asked. He was observant.. A little too observant. I didn't really register it because I was dying of thirst. 

"Oh my God, I would KILL for a drink!" I exclaimed. (Ha! Ha! You like my little pun? You know you like my pun..) 

"There's a little cooler on the back seat. Not much of a selection I'm afraid, I hope you like grape soda. You can't have the diet pineapple Shasta that's mine!" He said jokingly. I didn't give a fuck if it was bottled raccoon piss I needed fluids.

"Grape is fine with me" I said.

"Help yourself" he offered. I leaned into the back and popped open the cooler. Three 20 ounce plastic bottles of grape crush, and a can of diet Shasta Pineapple.. Gross. I twisted the cap off and guzzled the drink like a frat boy. 

Wow! You were thirsty.. Have another one if you want. Clint offered.

"Don't mind if I do." I grabbed a second one drank about half of it, then casually sipped the rest while we engaged in some idle chit chat for a few minutes. That's when I realized something was off. By actually sipping slowly and tasting the soda, something wasn't right. He had just pulled into the street he said he lived on. But it wasn't a street, it was a desolate dirt road surrounded by empty desert. Up ahead in the distance I could see an old abandoned church and nothing else. That's when things hit me like a mac truck. I suddenly felt like everything was moving in slow motion. Clint reached into the glove box, took out a cassette and slid it into his tape deck.

"You like Gorgoroth? You a black metal fan? Ha ha.." His accent completely gone now. His facial expressions totally different. He cranked the volume to the absolute limit. Rapid fire machine gun bass drums, menacing frantic guitar riffs and indecipherable growling and screams. Clint took his hat off and tossed it in the back seat. His head was shaved bald and his entire scalp was covered in black and grey tattoos of demons biting the flesh off of angels. He took off his sunglasses and threw them as well. He looked at me with a smile that would scare Clive Barker. He had Marilyn Manson style zombie contact lenses in, and the white parts of his eyeballs were tattooed black. FUCK.. How the hell did he drug me? The bottle was completely sealed, I had to break the little plastic tabs and everything. I ripped the label off, and saw a little bump.. He had used a syringe to taint the soda and then melted a little plastic on the injection site to seal it. Damn that's clever..

"You motherfucker!" I slowly slurred at him. He cackled like a deranged witch, then began screaming along to the song playing at the top of his lungs, and punching the steering wheel with both hands. then contorting his upper body in nightmarish positions. His final big reveal, his pièce de resistance.. He removed the fake teeth he was wearing, and displayed his real teeth. He had filed all his front teeth down into sharp points. He had a mouth like a fucking piranha. FUUUUCK. 

"You better not die on me, my little Angel, I've got so many plans for you. I can't wait to rip those pretty eyes of yours out. I haven't decided If I want eat them or use them for decoration.. You drank enough Rohypnol to put a rhino down! Ha ha ha Dumb bitch." More cackling from him as we began to approach the church. I had to act quickly before I blacked out or it would be a wrap for me. He wasn't wearing his seatbelt, I was.. 

I punched his throat as hard as I possibly could. As he instinctively grabbed his neck gasping for air, I got my leg across to his side and slammed my foot on the accelerator and yanked the steering wheel. I sent us careening into the side of the church, the wood was so old, half of the car was in the church and the other half outside it, smoke was billowing out of the car in all directions. Clint had slammed his head into the steering wheel, his nose destroyed, blood flowing out of it like a sieve. His mouth was also a bloody mess, he definitely lost a few of those shark teeth. A few shards of glass from the windshield were lodged into his face. 

The "artwork" on his scalp had been replaced with several deep bloody gashes, big sections of the skin flopping off to the side as if it were clothing. Miraculously he was still conscious, dazed and temporarily incapacitated, but conscious. I only had about 40 seconds until I passed out. I scrambled for my purse, all my syringes were color coded for quick Id and fast deployment. I grabbed the red one, pure pharmaceutical grade adrenaline. I fumbled for the vein on the top my hand, I was seeing in triplicate now. I've got 15 seconds max. I got the needle in as best I could, and slammed the plunger, injecting the entirety of the contents.. In normal circumstances that would be enough adrenaline to make someone's heart explode, but I had so much CNS depressant in my system, it just felt like I had a few espressos.

 I sighed deeply with relief, and went into my purse again. I pulled out the blue syringe, that was my special concoction of paralytic and sedative. I took off the cap and then hammered the syringe into Clint's jugular. I should have gave him the full amount, but that would've certainly killed him, and I wanted his death to be agonizingly prolonged. I wanted it to last weeks.. I grabbed the syringe hanging out of his neck like a Frankenstein bolt and twisted it all around in his throat, breaking the needle off inside him in the process. He let out a blood curdling scream.

"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!" "YOU FUCKING BITCH!!, YOU FUCKING DUMB BITCH!, I'M GOING TO DO THINGS TO YOU THAT WOULD GIVE SATAN NIGHTMARES!!"

"Oh yeah? Good luck with that CLINT!" I said with a cartoonish Texas accent just to mock him. "By the time you wake up YOU'RE going to be the Jesus bolted to that crucifix in there. And that's just the beginning, I'm going to start off with level 3 pain. But we're taking this shit all the way to 11.. Looks like you picked up the wrong dumb bitch huh? He looked at me with the horrifying realization that he had fucked with his own kind. He knew exactly what I was now. "How many?" He barely managed to utter.

"What?" I asked confused. 

"Are you fucking deaf? How many have you killed?" He snapped at me, still defiant.

"You're going to be 29." I said proudly. He started simultaneously coughing and laughing, then giggling like a little kid.

"Amateur" He said with a bloody toothless smile. Then his eye lids slowly closed against his will.

The inside of this "church" makes the house in Texas Chainsaw Massacre look like a wholesome sitcom dwelling in comparison. The "Jesus" I thought I saw on the cross was actually a badly decayed corpse dressed up to look like Jesus. There were huge stained glass windows everywhere, but he had changed the saintly scenes you would normally see in church windows with ghastly demons and people burning. There must have been a thousand crosses in this place, all of them nailed upside down. He had hung up a black "chandelier' made out of human skulls that dangled in the center of the church. Then I discovered his "art".. It was "mixed media" all right.. You know what, I'm not going to even describe them to you because I don't want this post flagged for gore, and I'm probably walking a fine line as it is with the shit I've already said. So just let your imagination run wild when you picture what his "creativity" might look like. 

There were massive bookshelves all over the place, filled mostly with satanic tomes, rare occult and witchcraft books, voodoo, spiritualism, things like that. He had one book shelf dedicated to art and artist bios. Another one dedicated entirely to serial killers.. Looks like he was a BIG Ed Gein fan. That tracks.. He had built a large loft in the back of the church still attached to scaffolding. I wanted to check it out, but the ladder looked sketchy. I could see from my vantage point that it was his bedroom. I explored every room in this hellish church. Most of them just filled with more of his "sculptures". One room, clearly his kill room, had 2 massive Baphomet statues sitting in each front corner. In front of those statues, a huge black alter adorned with big black candles. On the floor a classic inverted pentagram, old blood splatters sublimated into the concrete. The room smelled like rotting meat. The entire church did really. I found the "kitchen" and the smell made me gag.. Not going to describe the kitchen either. Not going to tell you what was in the five refrigerators, or the three dedicated freezers.

I went back into the main church room. There was a black preachers podium. On it sat two large photo albums. One had photos (not going to describe those) The other had news clippings. I soon realized who I was dealing with here. Clint, was the "I-35 Butcher!" An un-caught legend whose been at it since the early 80's, he easily exceeded Jack the Ripper or the Zodiac. He actually might be the G.O.A.T.. His body count vastly dwarfed my high score.. I don't know HOW in the hell he managed to not get caught, when someone could easily wander into his church of horrors.. Not the most discreet residence for a prolific serial killer. Did he even own this church or is he just squatting?

 I wanted to sit down on one of the pews and read all the articles in the second album. I lifted the big book about 5 inches off the podium before I realized there was something tugging at the bottom of it. A wire? and then I heard the click. I managed to jump for my life in the nick of time so I didn't get the full brunt of the blast. But I didn't escape it completely. The motherfucker booby trapped this place with explosives.. I managed to get up off the floor, the pain hadn't registered yet due to the shock. The stained glass windows were blown out, and the rotting Christ was now on the ground. The ringing in my ears was deafening.. I couldn't hear out of my left ear at all. I tried touching my left ear, and discovered it was gone. Completely gone.. Reservoir Dogs gone. My left arm now looked like Freddy Krueger's face.. Huge sections of char and bubbling skin. I then realized the entire left side of my head was in the same condition as my arm. The stench of my burnt hair putrefied the air. In the span of thirty seconds I went from a beautiful woman, to someone who could star in a Batman movie without any fx make up.. This would be a living hell for a narcissist like me.. Beauty to deformity..

My immediate instinct was to go out to Clint. I was going to kill him in the car.. I couldn't contain my rage. He needed to pay NOW. I stumbled outside and my stomach sank.. No one in the car... How!? How!!?? I screamed. That shot should have sent him to dreamland for 4 hours MINIMUM. I looked around frantically. Nothing but rocks, cactus, and tumble weeds as far as the eye could see. 

I heard the gunshot before the bullet tore through my right shoulder. I spun around and saw the sun reflected flash of a sniper scope on top of a big boulder about 200 yards away. I ran off in a zig zag pattern back into the church. Multiple bullets whizzing by me, missing me by inches. I Made it back in the church. There was a door by the kitchen that I hadn't gone in because I assumed it was the basement and I really had no desire to see it (or smell it!) based on what the primary floor looked like. I kicked the door open.. Pitch black no light switch. I had to use my burnt left arm to grab the phone from my back pocket, because I couldn't move my right arm at all now without excruciating pain. I put the flashlight on and headed down a narrow staircase. The basement was worse than the main floor as I suspected if you can fathom that. The stench was unbearable. I needed a weapon. In the darkness my leg knocked something over. I shone the light over it. A crossbow with one single arrow loaded. Then I heard the creaking footsteps above me. "Surprise!!" Clint shouted. I think he knew where I was hiding, but pretended like he didn't. He had all the time in the world, and could draw this out as long as he wanted to. More footsteps in a different direction. "You think you're the only one who knows about adrenaline and paralytics!? The hubris!" He taunted. "You got the poison, I got the remedy!!" he yelled, and then laughed manically.

Fuck this.. If I'm going out, I'm going out fighting.. I sprinted up the basement stairs like a berserked Viking about to raid a village. He wasn't expecting that at all. I caught him off guard as he was standing by the now destroyed podium admiring his own handiwork. I mustered up every last ounce of strength I had to lift up the crossbow despite the searing pain. I held my breath aimed at center mass, and shot. My aiming was off.. Instead of harpooning his chest like I intended. The arrow went straight through his neck. He fell backward and fired a few final shots from his rifle indiscriminately as he fell. Both bullets hit the ceiling. One shot hit the skull chandelier and it came crashing down. Shattered bone fragments speckling the church floor. 

I raced towards him.. There is nothing in the world I wanted more than to watch him die. I got to within 5 feet of him. I was standing in the center aisle that divided the two sections of pews. He wasn't dead yet.. But any second. He looked at me smiling and managed to vocalize a gurgled laugh. He slowly raised his right hand, he was holding some kind of remote control. "D-dd- Dumb B bb Bitch! Yu Y Y You're so ugly now.. Hu hu Hideous." He clicked a button on the remote, then dropped his arm and died. Before I could comprehend what was happening it was too late. The floor gave out from under me and I fell 30ft into some death pit. My spinal cord pulverized. I couldn't feel my lower body at all let alone move my legs. Then I heard the water rushing in.

I'd say I've got about 3 or 4 hours left until I drown. I could call the cops.. Maybe I could explain all this away, maybe I couldn't. Bottom line, I don't really feel like spending the rest of my life as a burnt cripple. This deathmatch was a draw.. I figured I would spend my remaining moments documenting this. I've got the perfect place to post it where people won't take it seriously anyway. Even in death I don't want to be outed. Vanity.. 

I managed to transfer all my money into accounts I set up for the families of my victims. I sent emails to my various accountants giving them instructions to disperse the funds equally to the specified people anonymously. The water is hitting my skin now. It is arctic. I've never felt water this cold in my life. 



Karma is an evil bitch.. And so was I.. And so WAS I.
