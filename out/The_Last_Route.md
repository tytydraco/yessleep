My name is Dwayne Nelson and this is my story.

*8:50 AM*

I woke up this morning to get ready to do my daily delivery job through my phone app (I usually wake up around 7:00 AM, but it is what it is). Since I was the Top Delivery Driver for this app, I scheduled my timeframe from 9:30 Am to 10:00 PM. It’s crazy that I’ve been working for this app for almost 5 years and never got any compensation for working this long while being one of the Top Driver for this app. This was really the only place to go at the moment since I messed up my legit job that had benefits, all because I got overwhelmed at the last minute during my grace period for that job and got released.

*11:25 AM*

Everything was going good with my deliveries. Then I got a message from the app saying: “By Tomorrow, Anyone Who Was Working Through This App Around Your Area Will Be Getting A Compensation of $500,000 Dollars As A Big Thank You For Sticking By With Us.” I was so ecstatic when I read the message from my phone. I had a great feeling that nothing was going to ruin this day…..or so I thought. Nevertheless, I continued my daily routine of delivering orders to strangers.

*2:35 PM*

The wait time to get these orders was making me tired beyond belief. I delivered about 2-3 orders since I got that message. But luckily, an $4.50 dollar order popped up for me and it said to pick it up from Freckled Lady (So I Won’t Get Copyrighted) and so I made my way to the Fast-Food place.

*2:59 PM*

After going through the long line of the Freckled Lady Drive-Thru, I parked to check if everything is there. Everything looked good, so I proceeded to deliver to order to the customer’s house. Once I got there, I handed the order to the customer (he was wearing a gaming headset) and then I checked to see if he left a tip, which was $0.00 dollars.

*3:35 PM*

I get a phone call and it was the customer from the previous Freckled Lady order accusing me of eating his food. Confused, I told him that I checked the bag and everything were in the bag. I’m one of the Top Drivers of this app, why would I purposely eat a customer food.

I told him that I didn’t eat his food, call DoorDash or call the Fast-Food place to get reimbursed. But he wasn’t hearing it and cussed at me related to my size and hung up. So, I drove back to his place, knocked on his door, and then once he opened it, one thing lead to another….I sucker punched him.

After punching him, I went in his house and grabbed his gaming headset. Then proceeded to use the headset to bash his face in. After it was over, I was left speechless and processing what I’ve just done.

*3:50 PM*

After hiding the body in the house, I left and then I get a call from the delivery app wondering why I was taking too long with the other order? Overwhelmed, I told customer service everything that happened (including the murder). Surprisingly, he said that it was okay, you gotta do what you gotta do, but he still have to give me late violation once I deliver the order.

*4:15 PM*

I proceeded to deliver the current order until another order popped up that I need to pickup in this route. Wanting to get extra money, I messaged the previous customer that I’m going to deliver their food soon once I pickup this new order. Once I parked to the restaurant, the previous customer messaged me outrage about the situation.

I decided to call them to calmly explain the situation, but just like the Freckled Lady customer, she refused to hear me out. Before she hanged up her phone (after calling me an Imbecile, threatening to give me a bad rating and cancelling the order) I yelled: “Listen Here, You F*ckhead, I’ve Been Delivering Food For This App For 5 Years and I’m Having A Very Hectic Day. And The Last Thing I Need Is A Selfish Asshole Yapping On My Phone Over Something That’s Beyond My Control. So Either You’re Going To Wait Patiently For Your Order or You Can Proceed To Do What You Were Planning, Which I Advise You Don’t Do That Because I Still Got Your Address In My Navigation and I’m Going To Kick Down Your Door and Carve Your Body Up While You’re Still Breathing”…..lucky for her, she chose the former.

After I hung up the phone, I figured I had nothing left to lose at this point. This is basically going to be the last time working for this app before the cops bring me in. So I bumped my end time from 10:00 PM to 12:00 AM.

*11:58 PM*

I’m over stressed, tired, and glad it’ll be over soon. And then a surprising $900 dollar order popped up. And the name assigned to the order was very familiar. But once I picked up the order and got in my car, that’s when the police finally showed up.

Without hesitation, I drove out of there parking lot and two cop cars decided to pursuit. Even though their sirens was bright as all hell, I was able to avoid them for the time being. The delivery time was 11:58 PM, and I got to the house at 11:58 PM sharp.

Once I knocked on the door, it opened and it was Stephanie Mendes. She used to be a girl that I had  the biggest crush on since middle school, but never have the courage to ask out on a date. I was surprised that she thought my name looked familiar after all of these years. Before you know it, all the stress I had were gone and for a brief moment: It was like I was back in my middle school with no worries in the world.

Then I noticed that she has kids, so guessing from that, She’s now happily married. But I wasn’t upset over the fact, I’m just glad that she found happiness. Then I asked: “Why Give Me The $900 Dollar Order”? She replied: “I Figured That You Finally Deserved A Break”.

As the cops showed up at her house, I told her it was time for me to go. I was too embarrassed to tell her what I did, but then for the first time ever: we both hugged and as the siren light grew brighter, she told me that everything was going to be okay.
