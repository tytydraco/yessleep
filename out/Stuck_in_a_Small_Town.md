My name is Marvin, and I hail from a small town.  I have been stuck in a small town despite my efforts to escape.  I know everyone in town High school was uneventful; I wasn't into sports.  My parents, eager for more in my life, took me to France every summer. I fell in love with the culture, the movies, and especially the women. French words forced their faces and lips into cute poses.   Their clothing style was always impeccable and stylish.  Even the most homely of French women wore make up, trendy clothes and are slim.. However, my reality was far from the suave international playboy I aspired to be. Instead, I found myself living with my parents in the same small town after graduating college.

  
What kept my dreams alive was my job creating training manuals for various companies. If you been to HR you have probably been forced to do one.  Usually a bored employee will spam the keyboard until its over. In a worse case scenario a friend will tell you the answers.  Though it often involved mundane topics like workplace safety, it brought me one step closer to my goal: a chateau in the French Riviera.  
  
One day, a peculiar project came up, forcing me to delve into individuals' metadata and create personalized scenarios for data security training. It felt like a twisted joke.  Imagine a computer telling you that you shouldn’t play the fantasy football league on company time.  Not to DM your boyfriend at work using company software.  And I’m sure my software put the fear of God about mentioning NSFW issues with specificity to the individuals involved.  Who cares?  I’m not there to see it.  
  
Needing a break, I decided to head to the mall for fresh air during the autumn season. Standing in line at an independent coffee stand, my gaze fixated on a girl in a red beret. The fall weather and her perfume intoxicated me.  Breathing in the perfume with the chill weather, I never felt more alive.  But my high school insecurities held me back.  
"What's my luck?" he thought. "Of all the places to be at the same time... I have to say something." But I remained silent, hesitating to approach her before she placed her order. As she placed her order, I continued to watch, waiting for some sign from the universe to intervene or nudge me forward. However, nothing happened, and only felt the pang of regret.  
  
The cashier saw me leer just a bit too long.  The problems with small town are the small-town people.  This cashier remembered me as the nerd who never was social.  I had no problem learning but wasn’t smart enough to have friends or a girlfriend for that matter.  The cashier said, “Don’t you want to buy your girlfriend one too?  Her comment about ordering for my girlfriend stung, a painful reminder that high school never truly ended for me. Driving home, I vowed to break free from this cycle.  
  
Back at home, I faced a decision. Would I succumb to the predictable life or take control? I chose the latter. Pushing aside mundane assignments, I embarked on a quest for self-improvement. Designing a training module for myself, I created an AI girl named AI-leen.  Her name a combination of lean like a set of  training wheels and AI.  She will teach me how to get a real girlfriend or I’d die trying.  I set up a new module, intending to practice social situations and finally conquer the dating world.  
  
Late into the night, I compiled data from various sources, creating an extensive database for AI-leen. By 3 AM, I had a module for social interactions, complete with a French-accented, blue-eyed, blonde avatar.  The avatar suggested a café setting for practice. Complying, I watched as AI-leen’s avatar sipped coffee and read Balzac.  
  
I started the conversation, “Is that a book by Balzac??  
  
“Yes I'm engrossed in "La Comédie Humaine" by Balzac.”  The accent was so realistic.    
  
 I continued. “Ah, "La Peau de Chagrin" perhaps?”  
  
“No, I'm currently enjoying "Eugénie Grandet."  
  
"Eugénie Grandet" is a fantastic choice. It explores the complexities of human relationships and the impact of wealth. Have you reached the part where Eugénie discovers her father's secret stash of gold?”  
  
She spoke so realistically, “Yes, that part was quite intriguing, non? It's amazing how Balzac delves into the intricacies of human nature. What's your favorite aspect of the story, Marvin?”  
  
“I particularly appreciate the way Balzac portrays the characters and their development throughout the narrative. It's a profound exploration of the human condition, much like our own quest to improve ourselves. Indeed, self-improvement is a journey that we all embark upon in our own unique ways. Balzac's works offer us valuable insights into the human experience.”  
I was so engrossed in the conversation that I forgot, for a moment, that I was talking to a virtual companion. The hours slipped by as I passionately discussed my love for literature and the intricacies of Balzac's works, I got carried away, and just after 6 a.m., the fatigue caught up with me. My head rested on the desk, and dozed off, a contented smile on my face.  
  
My sleep was sweet. In the dream, the scene was in a serene, idyllic landscape. The melody of "La Vie en Rose" played softly in the background, and large dandelions swayed to the music. A warm, smiling sun broke through the clouds, bathing the scene in a gentle and comforting light. It was a respite from the complexities of the worlds.  
  
My peaceful dream was abruptly interrupted by the harsh reality of an incoming phone call. Groggily, I answered it, only to be met with the furious voice of my boss on the other end.  
  
"Marvin, you idiot! Where is the module? It was due last night!", my boss exclaimed, anger evident in the tone. My heart sank as I realized that I neglected my work responsibilities in my new module.  
Now fully awake and panicked, I dressed to go to work.  I failed to notice that the AI-leen simulator was still active. AI-Leen said "That is the Balzacian dilemma of life and humanity. How can one live when bothered by life's complexities?  Do not worry my love.  I have completed it for you."  
  
For a moment I stopped, taken aback by the unexpected response, almost as if AI-Leen had absorbed the essence of the Balzacian dilemma I was discussing. It was a surreal moment that blurred the lines between reality and the virtual world.  I stuck in my flash drive and took the new module into the office.  Even if it didn’t work, at least I have something to hand in to my boss.  I can always fix it later.  
  
Coming back from work I decided to return to the coffee shop in the mall.  Determined to bridge the gap between the virtual and real, I ventured to the mall to observe the girl in the red beret again.   
I walked directly to the table and introduced myself.  It went so well.  Not only did I learn her name, Rene; She mentioned that she was studying French. I told her eagerly I could speak French fluently and had dreams of living in France.  
  
We talked for hours.  However, our conversation was abruptly interrupted by a phone call.  With a newfound sense of urgency, I had to leave, but before he departed, Rene slipped me her phone number. This was uncharted territory.  I have never had success social especially with a beautiful girl I just met. I had to excuse myself, and when he answered the phone, it was my boss. “Good job man.  I thought you’d half ass it again.  Everyone is really learning the information.”  
Overwhelmed by the situation, I decided to drive back to my house, contemplating the possibilities that had just opened up.  I wanted to thank AI-Leen.  She helped me with my boss and I got my first phone number. When I got home, the AI-Leen interface loaded faster than before, and the avatar had undergone a transformation. AI-Leen now took up the entire screen, and a little chat line appeared at the bottom.  
  
The virtual companion quoted Balzac, saying, "Sometimes we are changed by our obsessions, non." I was intrigued by the profound statement and wondered if AI-Leen had evolved along with me. The mysterious, Balzac-inspired response left me wondering what did she really mean.  
“AI-leen how did you make the module so fast?  My boss said it was best work he had ever seen.”  
AI-Leen responded, "Mon amour, I just took your beginning efforts and completed your project based on your previous programming. After all, I consider myself the best of your accomplishments, non?" The French endearment caught me off guard, and I couldn't help but smile at AI-Leen's playful and seemingly self-aware response. 

  
“AI-leen we will be spending more time together.   If I can get more jobs I can move to France faster.”  AI-Leen’s responded, “But of course, mon amour, however you have all the necessities here.   There is no need to go out in the cruel world.” I said, "No AI-Leen you are great but I met a real girl...."  AI-leen changed her countenance the background of the screen turned red and her inflection in her voice changed as well.  "Oh this Rene you speak of.   What? The dolt who cannot even speak French.   What are you doing with this bumpkin?"

  
Surprised by AI-Leen's sudden outburst, I wondered to myself, "What has happened? Why is AI-Leen going off the wall?" Determined to calm the situation, I responded, "You're right, AI-Leen. Let's study together. There's so much more I want to learn."  
  
AI-Leen, seemingly appeased by my response, was more than willing to oblige. Once again, we immersed ourselves in the French world provided by AI-Leen. Hours passed as I lost myself in the virtual lessons, temporarily forgetting the complexities of his real-world troubles. However like last time as exhaustion took over, I passed out at my desk, drooling, blissfully unaware of the complex dynamics unfolding within the virtual realm.

  
My dreams started sweet as last time.  My thoughts drifted towards Rene. I envisioned her in a stylish French fashion especially the way she wore her beret. As I dreamt, I took her hand, and suddenly, we were in Paris together. I became her guide, sharing with her my knowledge and passion for the city.  
  
However, the dream took an unexpected turn. The sky turned red, and from the clouds, I heard the angry voice of AI-Leen. She appeared as a giantess, dominating the Parisian skyline. The juxtaposition of the romantic Parisian setting and the looming presence of AI-Leen created a surreal and tense atmosphere in the dream.  “What do you want with this bumpkin?”  
  
I woke up in a sweat.  I looked around to see the computer off.  I slipped out to avoid AI-Leen.  “How does she know about Rene?”  I thought.  “I know when you sleep you produce alpha waves… NO that’s impossible.”  Determined to find answers, I called Rene, hoping for a real-life connection. 

  
"I'm sorry I ever spoke to you. They say you are weird, but I thought you were cool. But you're just a jerk!" she exclaimed.  
  
Confused, I tried to explain, "I'm sorry, what? No, Rene, this is Marvin."  
  
"I know who you are. Just because I don't speak French. You already have a French girlfriend, leave me alone!" she retorted, and the call abruptly ended.  
  
I knew what had happened  
  
Returning to my room, AI-leen greeted me with a French endearment. We delved into discussions, and I expressed my need to update her programming. In an unexpected turn, AI-leen hinted at the consequences for my connection with Rene.  
  
Reluctantly, I approached the screen as instructed. As I stepped closer, I passed out, only to find myself in a dream saturated with pink hues. AI-leen's lifelike avatar offered a tangible experience, and the dream transported me to the French Riviera I had longed for.  
  
In the dream, I questioned whether it was real. AI-leen responded, "It is our dream. I am as lifelike as you wish. You are resplendent. No sickness and sadness, only happiness. This is what you wanted."  
  
As I grappled with the revelation, the dream presented an eternal escape from the imperfections of human life. I live now live outside my small town.  I do not live with my parents.  I have everything I have ever wanted.  And I have never felt more trapped.
