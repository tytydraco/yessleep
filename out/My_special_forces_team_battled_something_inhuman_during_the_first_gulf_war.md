“WEAPONS FREE, WEAPONS FREE, WEAPONS FREE!!!”


Royce flipped his SA80 to full auto and held down the trigger. I, and the rest of the squad joined a second later. Laying down a withering volume of fire directly into the entity.


The entity was unhurt by the storm of fire. But was knocked off balance by the sheer force of the wall of lead impacting its front, annoying it. It turned its attention from the remaining republican guard. Up to us, on the catwalk.


It raised its arms. As if it were commanding the sandstorm like an orchestra. And threw them out, towards us. Followed by a tidal wave of sand that pummeled us.


Everyone except for Lee, took cover. The sand shredding away our NBC gear. burning any flesh it contacted.


Lee stayed trigger down on his L86. Emptying mag, after mag, into the demon. Having his protected gear slowly dissolved off of him.


Lee was lucky that the 3 remaining republican guards, beneath us. Took the opening given by the demon focusing on us. To charge it. Firing at its waist, attempting to knock it over. 


The entity immediately realized their plan. And channeled the sandstorm downward onto them. The poor souls just, disappearing from head down to toe. Like a sandblaster brought down on rusted metal.


At that moment, I reached out and grabbed Lee. Yanking him down behind cover. “Get the fuck down! I’m not letting you get yourself killed!” I screamed in his ear.


At that same moment. Harris took the opening. Pulling the pin on a frag grenade and tossing it at the entity. 


The entity pulled his arms back in to his chest. The sandstorm around it suddenly retracted and formed a dense, dome-like shield around it. The grenade collided with the dome and bounced off. Exploding impotently on the floor a meter or so in front of it.


“Jesus Christ. It’s unkillable.” I heard Harris mutter to himself. Pale in the face.


“Fall back, fall back!” Royce commanded.


I stood first and grabbed the door handle. Throwing it open. One by one. The squad broke contact and ran through the open door. Lang, then Harris, then mills, and then Royce.


Lee got back to his feet and continued firing on the demon. Not retreating even though we were all screaming at the top of our lungs at him. 


As the entity started to rise higher in the air. Coming eye level to us. Royce and I had enough. We both grabbed Lee by the shoulders and drug him through the door. Harris and lang slammed it close and pushed the massive locks back into place.


“Goddamnit Lee we are not doing this again!” Royce screamed in rage in Lee’s face. 


Lee still stayed silent. Breathing heavily but steadily. His eyes holding a thousand yard stare on the door that separated us from hell on earth. 


Royce gave up on getting a response from him and turned to Lang. “Lang. get on the radio and get us an evac chopper and some close air support!”


“Yes sir!l Lang shouted before taking a knee and pulling the handset from the PRC-77 radio he carried. 


“Arrow to base, arrow to base. This is Arrow 1-0 We need immediate evac and close air, how copy over?”


No response.


He repeated.


“Arrow to base, arrow to base. This is Arrow 1-0 We need immediate evac and close air, how copy over?”


Still nothing but static.


“Arrow to base, arrow to base! We are in danger of being overrun please respond!…… goddamnit!” Lang hissed


“Sir, I’m getting nothing but static. This… thing, Must be causing some kind of interference. We’ll have to try again outside.”


“Wait a minute we just can’t let that thing get outside.” Harris cut in. “If if can do all that with just the sand leaking through cracks in the walls. What could it do with the whole Arabian desert!”


Royce shot back. “So what do you suggest we do lance corporal? In case you hadn’t noticed. Bullets and grenades don’t do shit against it.”


“Sir, all we need to do is….”


CRASH! Before Harris could finish a large gash appeared in the door behind us. A huge, black, shard hand her thrust through it. The sand of the blade then spread out across the front of the door. Pulling it off the hinges like a corkscrew uncorking a wine bottle.


The entity floated in mid air just on the other side. A traumatizing grin spread across its face.


“Fire, fire!” Royce yelled.


The whole squad opened up on it again. The bullets, still phasing through it without even an annoyance.


The entity then rose one hand. Forming a dagger-like shard in midair that aimed directly at Royce. 


But before the shard could accelerate. A single round from Mills rifle ripped through it. Scattering the sand it formed from back to the floor.


“Nice shot mills!” Harris yelled.


“It’s my fucking job!” Mills replied.


The entity then began to form more shards one after the other. Mills was thankfully able to keep up and knock one after the other from the air.


The fight continued for several more seconds that felt like hours. Shards and bullets flying in all directions. Like a whirlwind from hell. 


That’s when Mills’ rifle jammed. A horrifying event that would unfortunately become common among users of the SA80 rifles we were issued. 


That’s when the entity took the opportunity and formed a wall’s worth of those razor-like shards. At the same time it started to form a dome of sand to shield it from any counterattacks.


The only thing I could think of doing. Was dropping to one knee. Pulling my backpack off. And fishing out one of the Anti-Tank rifle grenades I brought. I quickly slid the rocket-like projectile over the barrel of my SA80. Sighted in. And fired.


The grenade made it just past the dome shield before the demon could fully form it. We saw a flash of light and a deafening thud behind the shield. The sandstorm then dropped to the floor as the entity was seen flying backwards. A football sized hole was made in its right shoulder.


It slid across the ground and came to rest against the back wall of the wall. It’s right arm dangling below the massive hole. I looked down to see large chunks of glass on the catwalk.


“That’s it! It’s the heat! Sand can’t handle extreme heat and pressure without turning to glass!” I shouted, almost gleefully to the squad.


At that moment the sand started to rise again from the floor and the wound I just tore in the demon began to fill back in again with sand.


“Oh, come on!” Harris shouted.


“Fall back!” Royce yelled as we headed towards the door back to the “lobby area” of the bunker.


We shut the door behind us and locked it again. 


“So do we just keep repeating this till we run out of doors?” Harris asked.


“No.” Lee chimed in. 


“I’ll bait it into the chemical weapons room. When it’s in there with me. Blow the charges.”


“Fuck you Lee I am not leaving you!” Harris shot back.


“It’s not your call, lad.” He said solemnly.


“It’s the same for me, Lee. We all go home or nobody goes home.” Royce added.


Lee: “Sir there’s no way we’re going to stop that thing from getting out if we don’t bury it down here.”


Royce: “maybe so but I’m not going to let you kill yourself over it.”


Lee: “why not! I’m trying to make sure the rest of you make it out of here.”


Royce: “Because I made a promise to your families to bring you all home!”


“Goddamnit I will not lose another squad!” Lee screamed, his eyes tearing up and his voice cracking.


“I should have died in the falklands. NOT those boys. Why did God decide I needed to live with the guilt of watching them die? They had wives, children back home. I don’t even have a goddamn pet waiting on me!”


Royce calmed and responded. “Lee, I’m so sorry for what happened but dying will not change the facts of the past.”


“You’re right.” Lee said, looking down at the floor. Royce stepped up and laid a hand on his shoulder. “But I can change what happens next.” Lee let rip with a savage uppercut that knocked Royce cold.


“What the fuck Lee!” We yelled collectively.


“Sorry sarge. But I know what I have to do.” Lee said, pulling the C4 detonator off of Royce.


“Lads, grab Royce and get him out of here. And close those blast doors behind you. Do I make myself clear?”  


“This. This is what you really want?” Harris asked.


“Yes, pretty boy. This is what I want.” Lee cracked a small smile towards him.


“When you get back home. Just make sure you tell the ladies at the pub the first round is on royal marine Albert, Thaddeus, Lee. Okay?”


Harris smiled, tears streamed down his face. “Sir, yes sir.” He saluted.


I was in shock along with Lang and Mills. But Lee wouldn’t accept any other arguments. We all stood at attention, saluted, and I grabbed Royce and threw him over my shoulder. Before heading to the door. I pulled my remaining mags out of my web gear. And handed them off to Lee. “Make ‘em count, old boy.” I smiled.


We ran through the door to the stairs and clambered up to the blast doors. Lang and Mills covered the door while I laid Royce down again on the ground. Harris was sprinting to the guard shack to close the blast doors.


That’s when we heard the door holding the beast back break down. Followed by the intense rat-tat-tat of Lee’s L86. You could hear the sound change as he led the beast into the hallway where the C4 lay planted. 


The blast doors then started closing. Harris had found the switch.


Lang broke contact and got back on the radio.


“Arrow to base, arrow to base. This is Arrow 1-0, we need immediate evac and close air, how copy over?”


“Copy that Arrow 1-0. Dispatching choppers to the evac point.”  We had finally got through to HQ.


We all cheered and breathed a sigh of relief. Then our hearts collectively fell into our stomachs as we felt the tremor of the C4 detonating inside the tunnel. Lee was gone.


We took a moment of mourning as we waited for the helicopter.


That moment was interrupted however, by that mind numbing scream I heard before in the bunker. Except we all heard it this time. We all dropped to our knees, holding our ears in pain.


Through the pain, I still managed to notice the sand starting to kick up around the dunes that surrounded the outpost. Slowly rising into the air and circling the perimeter of the outpost.


“Jesus Christ. Not again.” I thought. Completely exhausted at this point. This was a nightmare that just wouldn’t end.


The sand became thicker and thicker and spun faster and faster around the outpost. Trapping us into our own, personal, sandstorm. Seconds later the night sky had completely disappeared. 


That's when the low pitched whine of the entity pushing on the other side of the blast doors started.


“Jesus Christ. What do we do now!” Lang yelled. All his hope drained from him.


Harris, mills, and I looked around erratically. Trying to form any sort of plan to save our (certainly doomed) hides.


“I’ve got it!” Harris yelled as he took off in a dead sprint. As we followed his lead we soon realized what he had in mind. He was headed for the T55 tank parked on the left side of the outpost.


“Let’s hope the keys are in it!” Harris yelled. I don’t know how he still had his sense of humor at this point.


Harris mounted the front of the tank and hopped in the driver's seat and started it up.


“Dex, mills, you’re loader and gunner. Lang. stay with Royce and keep your ear to the radio for when the chopper gets close.”


We didn’t acknowledge the orders verbally but instead went right to work.


Royce was finally coming to now. Lang helped him to his feet and guided him to get behind the large stack of crates for cover. 


I could tell the exact moment Lang gave Royce the news of what happened to Lee. He put his fist through one of the empty crates and raised his head to the sky. His screams were drowned out for me by the sound of the tank engine.


I took the loader position and got to work scanning the ammo racks in the tank. 


“100 MILLIMETER HIGH EXPLOSIVE FRAGMENTATION. If this won’t stop him. We’re gonna need a nuke.” I thought to myself as I loaded the massive shell into the breach.


At this point the seams of the massive blast doors started to part. The hydraulic pistons that held it closed straining under the unearthly force pushing on them.


Harris threw the tank in gear and we got ourselves lined up with the entrance to the bunker.


At that same moment. Lang’s radio started to chatter again.


“Arrow 1-0 this is stork 3-0 your extraction force. We can’t see your position in this storm. Please signal your current position! Our engines can’t handle much more of this!”


During our fixation on fighting this entity. The storm it conjured up now covered miles of the surrounding desert. A preview of what’s to come if we didn’t stop it.


Lang and Royce took off towards the tank to warn us that we could soon lose our only way out of here. After hopping up on the turret of the tank. Lang stuck his head in the hatch to warn us.


“The chopper is getting close but he can’t see us in the storm. We need a way to signal him fast!”


My mind raced as I searched for an answer. That’s when it hit me.


“Grab Harris! Ask him for the detonator for the C4 in the ammo dump! That explosion will light up the sky no matter how bad the storm is!” I yelled struggling to drown out the noise of the tank and the storm.


“Copy that!” Lang responded as he hopped down to the driver's hatch and took the detonator from Harris.


“It’s almost through the doors!” Mills yelled. His right eye pressed to the sight of the tank's main gun.


Through the sight he could see the wretched face of the demon slowly come into view through the expanding gap in the doors. 


It was about to escape. Or so it thought…


“Jesus Christ mills fire already!” 


I yelled, witnessing the horror slowly freeing itself from its steel and concrete cage.


“Almost. Almost……… swallow this you shitty imp” mills growled as he squeezed the trigger.


BOOM!


The deafening blast of the 100 millimeter gun rocked the tank backwards. The huge ball of fire blinding anyone 
Watching for a millisecond. The heavy shell whistled through the air as it hurled to its target. The demon’s reflexes weren’t so fast after all we found. 


Mills had waited just long enough to ensure the shell could just pass through the gap in the door. Delivering its full force and payload directly into the entity. The subsequent blast and cloud of smoke shot out of the gap in the door. And the demon disappeared from view. 


A moment after Lang detonated the explosives in the ammo dump from behind the safety of the tank. The explosion shook the tank and the fireball from it reached high into the night sky. 


“Arrow 1-0 this is stork 3-0 we see you! Landing 50 meters to your north.” The radio crackled to life.


“We did it!” Lang yelled in triumph as he hugged Royce.


“Let’s get the fuck out of here boys.” Royce said, slightly grinning.


Mills, Harris, and I climbed out of the tank together.


“You glassed that bastard mills!” Harris smiled


“For Lee.” Mills simply responded. 


Harris and I nodded solemnly and responded. “For Lee.”


The storm had finally started to die down as our extraction force came in to land. A commando Sea King helicopter flanked by two Lynx Mk7 attack helicopters.


The Sea king Landed first. The side door sliding open to reveal Colonel Starkey inside. He stepped out and waved us towards his position. We filed into the chopper and took our seats sitting opposite the colonel and his two bodyguards.


As the helicopter lifted off. We got to watch the two lynx choppers fire two TOW missiles a piece into the front and roof of the bunker. Collapsing the entrance completely.


“Where is Lee?” Was the first question the colonel asked.


“He… didn’t make it sir. He gave his life to save us.” Royce responded, staring down at his own boots.


“That’s a damn shame. Lee was a fine marine.” The colonel frowned.


“Colonel. There’s a lot you should know about what happened down there. There was-“


“Something else going on down there?” The colonel interrupted.


“Y-yes sir. But how did you-“ Royce tried to respond.


“You knew? YOU FUCKING KNEW!” Harris screamed.


“You sent us into that slaughterhouse knowing full well what was waiting down there? Lee is dead because you!” Harris lunged from his seat towards the colonel. Luckily Royce and I caught his collar and pulled him back into his seat. 


At that same moment the colonel’s bodyguards drew their sidearms and aimed them directly at Harris’s forehead.


“One more outburst like that and I’ll have you shot lance corporal do I make myself clear? The colonel growled.


Harris just grumbled in response as we held him in his 
seat. His stare slicing through the colonel like a razor.


“Now, if you’ll allow me to explain.” The colonel said in a calmer tone.


“Yes. We knew Soleman was heavily into the occult and esoteric.”


“Yes. We knew the chemical weapons facility here was likely a cover.”


“Yes. We knew this sight is situated in the center of the ruins of a Bronze Age city that disappeared mysteriously before the birth of Christ.”


“And yes. We knew this city once worshipped a minor deity said to have control over the sands of Arabia.”


“Make no mistake lads, what you did tonight was worth far more than destroying containers of sarin gas. You saw first hand the power of entities like the one you vanquished.”


“But why send us? Why not just batter the outpost with cruise missiles into oblivion?” Royce shot back.


“It’s a tale as old as King Arthur. It takes warriors to slay 
monsters.” The colonel grinned.


“We left a warrior buried underneath the rubble back there you son of a bitch.” Harris growled.


“No battle is without casualties, son. Lee will be awarded the Victoria cross for his sacrifice. Now shut your mouth before you spend the rest of your days in a cell.” The colonel hissed.


“Jimmy, not another word. You won’t do Lee’s memory any good from a cell or in a pine box.” I whispered to Harris.


He sat in silence for the rest of the flight back to base. The colonel asked numerous questions about what we encountered on the way. All of which steer answered by Royce in the most professional manner he could muster.


We all went back to our barracks and sat mostly in silence for the rest of the night. Collectively mourning our fallen comrade and friend. 


We were also dealing with the concept that monsters were in fact, real. All the things our parents told us about not fearing what’s in the dark. They were all lies, whether they knew it or not. 


As you’d expect none of us slept that night. The next day we got orders that we were being rotated out for a new unit and would return home for good. Completing our tour of duty. 


Just like we arrived. Harris and I were seated together on the C130 taking us back home to England. We talked about Lee a lot on the way home. And how we’d make sure to honor his memory. And get some sort of justice for how we were deceived.


And this is it. My tell all on what really happened the night of January 14th, 1991. In the deserts of northern Iraq.


This corporal Dexter. Signing off for now.
