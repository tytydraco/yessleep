I don’t know how long I’ve been in this room. The overhead light hums, flickering every few minutes, like it’s on the verge of dying. It smells in here; stale coffee, cigarette smoke, sweat. Maybe it’s mine. Maybe it’s his.

The detective sits across from me, rubbing his eyes. He looks exhausted, but not like he wants to sleep. More like he’s holding himself together by sheer force of will. His fingers tap against the metal table, slow and deliberate, a metronome counting down to something I don’t want to know.

I can’t stop crying. My chest heaves with every gasping breath. I want to wipe my face, but my hands are shaking too much. He doesn’t care. He just stares, his jaw clenched so tight I can hear his teeth grind.

Finally, he exhales sharply through his nose.

**“Mr. Holland, we don’t need a confession. We have all the evidence.”** His voice is flat, emotionless, but his fingers twitch like they’re itching to do something else. **“I just need to know; where is she?”**

I squeeze my eyes shut. My throat is raw.

**“It wasn’t me.”** My voice is barely a whisper, but I force it out again. **“It wasn’t me.”**

I sniff, trying to hold myself together.

**“I was on a date when the babysitter called. Kayla. She’s been watching Jenny for months now, she’s great, she’s reliable. But when I picked up, something was wrong.”**

The memory sends a fresh wave of nausea rolling through me.

**“Her voice was off. Like she was talking through a bad connection, but…wet. Garbled, like her throat was full of something. But I heard enough to know something was wrong with Jenny.”**

The detective doesn’t blink.

**“I ran out of the restaurant. Sped all the way home. I barely remember the drive; I just knew I had to get there.”**

I suck in a shaky breath.

**“But when I got there, something was…off. The house was dark. Too dark. The porch light wasn’t on, even though I always leave it on for Kayla. No sound. No movement. Just…stillness.”**

I pause, trying to keep my voice steady.

**“Then I saw the upstairs window.”**

My stomach twists.

**“The lamp was on in Jenny’s room. And Kayla…she was standing there, looking down at me.”**

A flicker of something in the detective’s eyes.

I grip the table, my knuckles white.

**“She was smiling.”**

The words taste like bile.

**“Not smiling; grinning. Too wide. Too forced. Like someone was pulling the corners of her mouth back with a hook. And her hand”**

I swallow hard.

**“She was waving. But her fingers were bent the wrong way, like they were broken.”**

I shake my head, trying to rid myself of the image.

**“I ran inside. Called for them. Nothing. Jenny was gone. Kayla was nowhere. But then”**

I hesitate.

**“Something moved outside.”**

The backyard. The swing set creaked in the breeze, but there was no wind.

**“She was there.”**

The detective leans in slightly.

I don’t want to say it, but I do.

**“Jenny.”**

The name feels foreign in my mouth.

**“She was standing in the backyard, barefoot in the grass, swaying slightly. The moonlight hit her face just right, and that’s when I saw it.”**

I can barely get the words out.

**“Her eyes.”**

The detective stills.

**“They were mine.”**

Silence.

The buzzing overhead light grows louder, like it’s listening.

**“I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. She lifted her little hand and waved at me; just like Kayla had. Same motion. Same broken fingers.”**

I swallow, my throat dry as sandpaper.

**“And then…she opened her mouth.”**

The detective’s stare sharpens.

**“She didn’t cry. She didn’t speak. She just…laughed.”**

A wet, gurgling sound, like something trying to force its way out of her tiny throat. It wasn’t a sound a baby should make.

**“I ran. I didn’t think; I just ran. But as I turned back to the house, the porch light flickered on.”**

I blink rapidly, my head throbbing.

**“And I saw myself standing in the doorway.”**

The detective stiffens.

**“What?”** His voice is barely above a whisper.

I grip the table harder.

**“Me. Standing there, staring back. Same clothes. Same face. But I wasn’t moving. And then…"**

I let out a shaky breath.

**"The me in the doorway? He smiled. And he waved."**

The detective stands abruptly. His chair scrapes against the floor.

The fluorescent light flickers again.

Something shifts in the reflection of the two-way mirror behind him.

Not me.

Not him.

Something else.

Waving.
