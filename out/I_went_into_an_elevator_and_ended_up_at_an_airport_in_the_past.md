Back where I live there was a small shopping mall. It was so tiny, half of the place was an unrelated business center. A two story high mall with only about 20 shops per floor. It was part of a much larger store, spanning kilometres and split into 12 blocks. I liked that mall. But this story wasn’t about that mall. One day when I was in that small mall. I don’t remember what I was shopping for but it wasn’t important. I decided to end my shop and head to the larger mall, the better one. To get down, I decided to you the elevator, rather than the stairs. I don’t know why but these stairs would hurt my legs. I went into the elevator. I have to say, it was a pretty clean elevator. I pressed the button to take me to the first floor and watched the screen in the corner. It was a digital but old LCD screen. As I looked away for a second, I saw the elevator doors close. I glanced back at the screen which now read “72”. 72? I checked to see the buttons. “1” was still lit. How? I looked back and saw the numbers count down from 72 all the way to 11, where it came to a stop. Then I saw the doors open.

The first thing I saw was a sign with “72” written on it. A door with a passage below it. I stepped out and looked behind me. I saw the same door and passage. It was hard to describe this area. It was a blue and yellow theme. Behind me, the sign read “1”. As I stepped further into this crowded place, I saw a large information desk to the left of me and a huge window to the right of me. Through it, sat a plane. A plane? A commercial airplane. Why? Was I at an airport? I had nothing with me other than the clothes on me, my phone and my watch. I tried going back through the door but it was locked. I went to the information desk and saw the time and date. It read “12:00 AM 3 DEC 2012”. I was in 2012? I approached the man and said “Where am I?” The man, in a bad accent, responded, “Terminal 4”. Below the date, I saw a television which displayed flight information. So I was at an airport in 2012.

I don’t know how I made it here and how I would get back but I needed a way back. Someone would need to tell me how I ended up at an airport in 2012. Ten years before. I decided to explore. The doors or I guess gates seemed endless. If I’m being honest it seemed like really poor design and placement even for the early 2010s. I walked until I saw Gate 36. Beyond that, was a very large area, complete with duty free and a staircase to a lounge. I looked at my phone which was now dead. I decided to walk into the duty free and find a charger. Perhaps, I could see the currency and figure out where I am. I hoped that the Lighting cable existed by now. While it was brand new, I found a cord which cost 120 riyals. I was in an Arabic country for sure but which one. As I walked to pay, I released I had no money. Would it be weird if I paid with my watch? Do smartwatches even exist? Would they even accept it. As the man ringed up the cord, I placed my watch to the machine and it went through. The man said, “how did you do that?” “Apple Pay,” I responded. “What’s that?”

“You can pay with your Apple Watch?”

“Apple Watch?”

After a while, I decided to leave and found a place to charge my phone.

All the gates were absolutely crowded with people. I found a seat with an open outlet on gate 11. I sat down plugged my phone in and waited. I looked around. How did I end up at an airport? What airport is this? How will I get back? Is this a dream? As I sat pinching myself, I heard a whisper in my ear, “I was expecting you.” I looked next to me. “It’s okay,” he said, “I know what happened. The same happened to me.”

“Who are you?” I asked.

“My name is not important. I am also from the future.”

“Really? Can you help me?”

“Yes,” he said. “But we have limited time. What is the time now?”

I looked at my phone which could turn on.

“1 am,” I said.

“We have time. Come with me.”

As we walked he explained his story, “I am from 2032. I, like you, ended up in this airport after going into an elevator. You are second to come and hopefully the last. If you escape, that is. First let’s talk about how to escape. To escape, you need to buy a ticket to Melbourne.”

“Melbourne?” I asked. “Why Melbourne?”

“I don’t know,” he responded, “they didn’t tell me.”

“They? Who’s they?”

“Them! At the end of the day, the clock restarts to midnight and you relive the day again. But you can never leave again. Every decade a new player from a random year in the future ending in 2 gets picked to return. But at the end they tell you what you should’ve done. It is forbidden for me to talk to you though. I am risking a lot just talking to you.”

“Why?”

“You’re not meant to know the rules.”

We headed to the airline desk to see if we could get a ticket to Melbourne. How would we get there though? We were after check-in. We decided to just go back to the entrance and risk it. “Oh, and also,” he started, “if you leave the airport the day restarts and you lose.” I decided to finally ask him what airport I was at. “Saudi Arabia International Airport.” Saudi Arabia International Airport? But that’s absurd. Saudi Arabia is a country. I understand maybe one airport for the country, but Saudi is huge! It has many airports. What about them? I decided to let it be. After all, I ended up in 2012 via an elevator. After heading downstairs to check-in, we approached a desk. “I would like to buy tickets. Is that possible?”

The check-in lady said, “Yes, if seats are available, you can buy them. Where do you want to go?”

“Melbourne”

“Alright, looks like the earliest, I can do is 11:30pm.”

Now, you might be thinking, oh, perfect, everything is going to be great! But don’t forget to account delays. And with airplanes, it’s kinda inevitable.

I approached the man with this question. “What do we do?” I asked.

“I guess we can only hope for the best.”

“Do you accept card?” I said.

“Yes,” said the lady.

“Perfect”, I said. I placed my phone to the machine and it thankfully went through. “Would you like to upgrade to business cla-“

“No, thanks,” I said, leaving and heading back to the Terminal. I checked my boarding pass. I would depart from gate 43. “This is goodbye, sadly,” said the man, “if they catch me talking to you, they’ll do unimaginable things to me.” “Oh, well, goodbye,” I said. I was alone but most of my question were thankfully answered. It was 2 am at that time. There was nothing more for me to do. I was left waiting until 11:30. I couldn’t leave, nothing. Thankfully, I had no luggage, so it was easy to walk around. I was quite tired so I decided to find an available seat. I set my alarm for 11pm just in case and went to sleep.

I woke up around 8am. The place was as crowded as before. Thankfully, I haven’t overslept. What was there for me to do? I looked at my phone. Huh? A new message. How, though? I looked at it. “They found me. Run.” Run? To where? I thought it would be smart to move. So, I decided to just go. Not sure where, but I headed back to where I came from. Gate 1. To see the window. When I got there, I saw a plane taking off. It was truly a sight. Since I was bored I decided to walk to another terminal. There were five terminals so a lot of space. As I explored I saw a nice little cafe, more info desks, more duty free plazas and so much more. I explored the place until 2pm. As I completed full circle and made it back to the windows, I saw another plane take off. And that was the last thing I saw before I got knocked out.

I woke up after an unknown time in a dark room tied to a chair. Behind me was the man. “I’m so sorry,” he said, “they found me.” But that wasn’t my focus. My focus was on the man in front of me. “So, you communicated,” he said. “You knew the consequences and you talked to him.”

“Oh, this is unfair. You can’t lock people up in an airport that doesn’t even exist.”

“Says who?”

“This is illegal.”

“How? There is no law. I made up a dimension. There is no law. There are no rules.”

“But why? Why would you do this?”

As soon as he said this, the rope untied. I darted for the door and left. A man went after me and another one went after the man. I was at the corner of the Terminal 4 duty free plaza. And I saw them. An escalator. I made my way up there and saw it. The most peaceful lounge ever. In the middle was a little dining area and surrounded was an endless sitting area. I payed for my entranced, got food and sat down. I are my food and checked my phone. It was 5pm. I instantly felt drowsy. As if someone put laughing gas to my face. As I fell asleep I heard a maniacal laugh.

I woke up to the sound of my phone alarm. Yes! My alarm saved me. I had 30 minutes though. I left the lounge and made my way downstairs. What was my gate? What was my gate? I looked at my boarding pass. Gate 43. That was not too far away. I made my way running away from the bodyguards who had already got the man. “As long as you make it through the gate doors, you win,” he shouted. I ran but, oh, no. The flight was delayed. The gates would only open at 11:50. No! Was I about to lose? Would I stay here forever? I had 40 minutes to run. Could I do anything? I decided to run to the window. When I got there I turned back. And so, I ran through the airport and no one noticed. Nobody cared. It was 11:50. It was time to run to the gate. The thing that sucked about this airport is they only have 10 minutes for boarding. I ran but it seemed like I would run out of time and energy. Nine minutes left. Eight minutes left. Seven minutes. Six. When there was one minute to go, I passed Gate 1. The gates passed me by quickly. It was 11:59. Could I make it before the end? I found my gate with 10 seconds left. Nine. I entered the seating area. Eight. The line was empty. Seven. The attendant was closing the doors. Six. I handed them my ticket. Five. Four. Three. Two. They stamped it and let me go. One.

I made it through the doors. I did it. I beat the game. The man was smiling at me. “Well done,” he said, disintegrating to ash. I boarded the plane with no more worries. I took my seat, put on a film, relaxed and flew into the Australian sunrise.
