I’ve been doing this for over twelve years, and until this morning, I thought I’d pretty much seen anything and everything that could scare a man. I guess I was wrong, and I think I need help.

I deal with hauntings and infestations of the unnatural kind. Not ghosts, exactly. Not sure I believe in those to be honest, but I am open to be proven wrong. 

No, my line of work regards more straightforward things. The type that grows teeth if enough people in the same place believe in them hard enough.

Belief can make the strangest things come crawling out of the dark. More *before*, of course, when entire towns could be praying to the wrong saint, or leaving offerings to what they thought were the local Tomte by their doorstep. Naive men falling for the Huldra, losing their souls in the process.

Things like that don’t happen anymore, not as often. Not even when I started this line of work. Occurrences have shifted with a more complicated humanity, are less *defined*. More mixed and shaped and diverse, I guess. For better, in that there are less sightings overall, but for worse in that it’s very hard to banish something you don’t know much about.

These days, most of the things I have dealt with personally don’t really have names or well-defined categories. Most are a blur of half-forgotten stories stitched together with urban myths and personal beliefs. We all have our own, well, ghosts. Where the stitches of belief meet are where disaster brews.

My last job sounded simple. Not completely unknown, which was refreshing. One of those “empty house, strange noises, weird shadows” type calls, extra points for being in a farmhouse just a short drive from the city I live in. Typical of its position, with a long and bumpy gravel road snaking its way through the fields, a small lake shadowed behind it and choked with reeds. I’ve been to a dozen just like it.

Whatever family had lived there before had left everything. Furniture, old toys, clothes still folded in the drawers, a small colourful pot still sitting on the broken stove. I don’t know for how long the house had been empty, but it was obvious the city’s teenagers had found their way there by the empty cans strewn about, the freshly broken windows. On the side of the door, someone had painted a crude face with three eyes and its mouth sewn shut, in stark red and black. Below it, in what was probably just black marker, names in different handwriting below a headline: Challenge the Lady of Death. Crap.

That was probably what did it, and as most of us know probably all it would take to start something sinister. A made up name, a dare of some kind, stories told in the dark. By themselves, each thing wouldn’t be enough to cause any issues - but again, belief is the contagion of creation. If the story stays consistent enough, and enough people enforce it through belief and fear, it can tether. They must have told the story a hundred different ways until it caught on. How she lived in the lake, how you could hear her through the drains, how she’d mark you if you spoke her name at midnight. This place could have been fed for weeks, or months, before I arrived. The tether wouldn’t be overly strong, but it could be *there*. That was enough.

The front door was stuck when I tried it, the wooden frame warped from the damp that had made its way inside through the broken windows. When it gave out, it made a simultaneously wet and dry sound, like tearing bark from a tree. A few snails clung to the inside of the frame, pale and glistening, their colourful shells made gray and brown by the light. I stepped over them. 

The air inside was cold and slick, smelt faintly of moss and earth and mould. Every wall was covered in small droplets of condensation. Between food wrappers and broken wood: scattered shells. Hundreds of them covered the warped floor, cracked faintly beneath my feet as I made my way through. I told myself that they had made their way in through the windows, came up from the lake. At the time, it didn’t matter that the nearest waterline was almost fifty meters downhill. 

I did the usual sweep. Room by room, slow, careful, meticulous. Tried to *feel*. 

Nothing was out of place except the smell. And sure, abandoned houses in the middle of nowhere wouldn’t necessarily smell like anything *different* than mould and wet, but it was very strong. Earthy smells tend to be… succinct? Delicate, maybe. Barely there. This was overpowering, but not necessarily in an unpleasant way. It didn’t smell like rot or ash, as would be expected if the tether was strong. Just earthy, damp. 

The living room was the only place not covered in garbage and graffiti. Arguably, it was relatively untouched. Someone had rolled up the carpet, put it neatly in a corner. Moved the striped couch out of the way, kept the space empty. There were no shells on the floor: instead, a bowl similar to the pot in the kitchen, the same retro pattern adorned its sides. It was filled with water, gone cloudy and thick. A handful of snail shells of different colours floated on the surface, spinning lazily even though the air was still. 

You tend to develop a really strong gut feeling for the tethers, but I felt nothing still. So, I did the bare minimum: I whispered the binding, poured salt on all thresholds, and hung an iron horseshoe atop the front door. I scratched the names away from the wall, but left the painting and headline. Too much work. I opened the door to leave, and that’s when I heard it: the softest scraping from an adjacent room. Slow, steady, like something was dragging itself towards me. I stopped mid-movement, tensed. My heartbeat was suddenly audible in my ears, but by then it was the only thing I heard. *Thump thump thump,* nothing else. I stayed like that for at least thirty seconds, then I left.

I finished the job, sent my handler a progress message with a weak tether and recommendation to re-check in a few weeks, then got in my car. I made it home before dark had settled, had dinner, watched some TV. Normal shit you do in the evening. I still felt nothing.

Then, as I was getting ready to go to bed, I heard it again. The *dragging*, from the bathroom. I froze, and for a moment I could swear I felt it: The tether. A warm, almost hot one, with a smell of wet moss and decay. The hair on my arms stood on end. And from the bathroom, something scraped again.

Lucky that I froze right in my hallway. I reached for the iron nail I keep on the table, next to my keys, and slowly made my way toward the bathroom.

I don’t know what I was thinking, exactly, but I just… threw the door open. The light was off. I reached for the switch, and stopped right in my tracks.

The sink was half full of water, opaque and faintly green. Dozens of snails clung to the porcelain, heads poked out as they made their way round and round. I swear I could see the trails around the rim. The water had a soft ripple to it, even though nothing touched it.

I took a step back. My breath felt warm. The smell hit me, then. Wet moss, damp, mould. Something sweet, rotting underneath. 

A larger ripple on the water, then a soft sound as the plug broke and the water started going down at speed, as if something was inhaling through the pipes. I dropped the nail.

the time I turned the light on again, the sink was empty of water. The snails remained, though. Moving their slimy bodies around the rim, around and around. 

I stood there for a long time, watching them. Trying to *feel*. The tether wasn’t as strong then, but it felt *off*, somehow. I don’t know how to explain it. As if it was missing an anchor. 

So, here I am, pretty sure I fucked up somehow. I have no idea *how*, though. That’s why I am writing here. It’s not like we go for after-work mixers or have annual meet-ups, but surely there must be *more* of us out there?

Everything *still* smells like moss in here, and there’s another fucking snail on my welcome mat. I live on the fifth floor. Hopefully someone who has any idea what the fuck is going on will read this, even if you’re not a banisher. I have tried looking in the handbook and online and found *nothing*, and I don’t know where to begin. If you know anything about weird tethers, please help.
