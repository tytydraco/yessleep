I have enjoyed mountain climbing for a long time. I've sought out many of the toughest mountains on this planet, and reached their peak. The thrill and excitement of reaching their peak is the greatest feeling for me.

That was, until I decided to climb Mount Corealitus.

Corealitus is an abnormally tall mountain for where it is, since the area around it is entirely flat, and it shouldn't be possible for a mountain like it to form where it did. But then again, science can be proven wrong.

Once I saw it on a map, I instantly knew I had to reach its peak. It looked suitably challenging, and was tall enough to have an amazing look across the land around it. So, I went to the nearby town at its base to prepare. 

This town was rather old, dating back to the 1600's. The locals were rather nice to me, and seemed to enjoy my presence. They didn't seem to get many tourists. But, when I told them of what I came to do here, every single person who heard it seemed to either gasp or be stunned to silence.

Turns out, the mountain is a major point of superstition due to the amount of reportedly odd phenomenon that occurred there. People have reported a variety of things happening there, from small things such as small, flickering lights in places you wouldn't expect to see them in, to impossible things such as shadows not moving, and reports of long extinct animals living there. Another thing they mentioned was that an odd fog always covered most of the mountain, with the exception of the peak and base of it.

This made it all the more exciting to me, as I could hopefully film the journey to see if what they said was true. Many of them said that I should turn back, and never go there, but I refused. If I had the hindsight I have now, I would've gotten the hell out of there as soon as I heard the first rumor about it.

Anyways, after the locals realized I wasn't budging about not going, the only thing they said was to go at the crack of dawn, and go as fast to the peak as I could, as to avoid as much phenomena as possible. Almost all of the reports of supernatural phenomena were reported at night, they said.

So, I finally started the trek up the mountain, recording anything of interest. At first, it was the average climb. Not too steep cliffs, but just enough so that if you weren't paying attention you would fall. I had no issues until I got about 10% of the way up, when I noticed something.

Despite it being about 2 PM, the shadows were at an angle you only see during noon.

It was small, but sorta freaked me out. Shadows don't do that. They always follow their strict pattern.

I managed to climb another 10%, and then I looked for a place to rest for the night. I found an area large enough for my essentials and a bit more room, so I set camp there. That was when I saw, or more accurately heard, something I thought impossible. The deep bellow of a whale. It was a long, drawn out, and unnerving sound. I was a bit shaken, but slept fairly well. At the crack of dawn, I again set out to go higher.

That's when the next oddity occurred.

As I was climbing a sheer cliff, I heard something cry out. It sounded like a bird of prey. The locals had said they had never seen anything but plant life live there, so the presence of a predator here put me on edge. That's when I made the mistake of looking for the source.

When I looked down, I saw its shadow. A massive falcon's shadow, with a nearly 15 foot wingspan and long claws I could see from the shadow. I could not see the bird itself thanks to the fog, but I was terrified. After I managed to climb up the cliff, it seemed the bird was gone.

After a bit more of climbing, I was finally getting close to the peak. Just one more day of climbing, and I'd finally be at the peak. While I had met some more oddities, the massive bird was the most notable one up until now. That was when, suddenly, I heard a roar similar to that of a lion's, but... different.

It sounded like nothing I'd ever heard before. It had a strange echo that made it sound old. The sound of an ancient beast on the hunt. I realized that what it might be on the hunt for was me. That was a great encouragement to get higher and higher. These weird things kept happening, from shadows twisting around the ground as if in pain, to the sounds of elephants trumpeting with the same echo as the roar of the lion, and more. I managed to record it all on my phone, which meant evidence of this mountain's strangeness. This mountain was starting to really freak me out. And then, I finally reached the peak.

For the first time since I left the base, I could see clearly around me. A gorgeous field stretching out far below me. The town at the base looked like a single splinter of wood from up here. As I basked in its glory, looking around, something suddenly caught my eye.

A temple.

What on earth is a temple doing up here??

Didn't the locals say nothing lived here? Then why would a temple be up here?

Well, the temple looked old. Whatever roof it might have once had was gone, leaving only the support pillars, seeming either trying to keep up the sky, like the Titan Atlas, or trying to pierce it with their broken tips. Even against my better judgement, I decided to approach the temple, to see if anything still remained. As I walked past it, still recording, I felt a presence. The wind brushing by felt like it was doing so intentionally, as if something was commanding it to do so.

That was when all hell broke loose.

The earth shook, and the temple's few pillars begun to shake and fall, crashing down all around me. Then, the shadows they were casting suddenly begun funneling towards a large open area, one of few areas that seemed untouched by the ravages of time.

And the shadows grew a face, and said something I will never forget:

"You, who found their way to this peak. Who went against their very instinct, to see what was here. Who was not scared by the thought of ancient beasts roaming this mountain. Who dared to film my creations. You interest me because of this."

"Wha-what??"

"I have never had a guest here for a long time, and have not wanted one for much longer than that. Even through my creations, you persevered. Does nothing scare your race anymore?"

I couldn't say a word. I only stuttered. Shadows can't speak. They can't create things. They can't see. So how did this one manage all of that????

"You have found what you sought. You have seen more than anyone in your time. Now, leave."

As if I was magically bound to those two words, I instantly packed everything and left. My descent was uneventful compared to the ascent. There were caves I had never seen before that led me down, past dangerous cliffs. I barely remember my descent. As soon as I was back at the town, I was looking for a way out of there, as far away from that mountain as I could. 

While I may have left that place behind, I have never felt alone in the dark ever since.
