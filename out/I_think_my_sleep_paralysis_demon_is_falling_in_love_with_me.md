I really need to break up with my sleep paralysis demon.

Have you ever had to suffer through a sleep paralysis? When you want to scream but the words dont come out? When you want to move but your body doesn’t feel yours?

If yes, I really hope the demon that haunts your paralysis isn’t as attached as mine.

It began when I slept for the first night in my new apartment. After putting in order the small amount of furniture I had, I hit the bed feeling a sense of satisfaction. This was going to be my new home, and it looked like one I always dreamed of. Cozy warm lights all around and plants that decorated the entire house.

What I didn’t know was that this apartment was also going to be the home of my new boyfriend. Well, the boyfriend I never chose.

When I woke up after going to sleep on the first night, it was still dark. My bedside lamp lit the room in a dim warm yellow shade. I didn’t mind waking up to be honest, not until I tried to grab water. That’s when it hit me, I was having sleep paralysis.

I tried to lift my finger, nope.

Turn my head, nope.

Say something, nope.

Well, I would just have to wait it out. I have had sleep paralysis before, and they haven’t been too bad. Nothing nightmarish. Just… boring.

Until that day.

As I darted my eyes around, something caught my attention. Hair. There were hair poking out from below the bedside. 

HOLY SHIT.

All the nerves in my body stood up and my heart started racing. This had never happened. What the hell. It felt so real that every cell in my body screamed “GET UP”.

But what could I do?

I just lay there, unable to move or express my fear. Just lay there looking at the head of hair. Well at least it wasn’t too bad. It was scary sure, but there was some comfort in knowing that my brain isn’t imagining some face poking out.

That comfort didn’t last long.

The next night it happened again. Sleep paralysis. And the head by my bedside. Only this time, it was more visible. I could see the total white eyes of the head just staring at me… without the eyeballs. I knew it was staring at me because every ounce of my existence had an instinct that I was being watched.

What the hell?

At this point, I really wished this would stop happening.

But my prayers went unanswered. The next night it happened again, only much worse. Now I could see the head completely up beside me. I could see the… ‘things’ crooked teeth as they sprang up in a smile that seemed to hide cruelty. The white eyes stared into my soul as I lay there frozen in fear. It lasted all night.

My work began to suffer. I slept through the day and tried to stay awake during the night, and failed at doing so each time. I hated these episodes.

The next night the head slowly sprang up again. 

I could not move. I could not scream. I could not get out.

So I saw him. And I saw the paper it had clenched between its teeth. A note? It said something. The handwriting was so bad it could be mistook for a toddlers. After some effort I managed to make out what it said.

“Girlfriend?” It said.

WHAT THE FUCK.

Is this literally made up demon trying to propose to me? I with all my strength tried to shake my head in a no, but of course I could do nothing. After a while I gave up to exhaustion, and a smile crept up his face again. I think he thought I said yes.

And thus began our relationship.

Every night he pops up his head, and in between his crooked teeth holds notes for me. Some nights its a sweet romantic note. Other nights its a threat on what he would do if I left him. 

I thought things might improve. I even hired a therapist. But all hopes for a brighter future were killed in cold blood yesterday.

As i walked around my bedroom in a frenzy trying to figure out a way to stay up all night, i noticed a paper poking from under the bed. I walked to the side of my bed and slowly slid my hand below the bed.

Notes. All of them. All those notes that I had been sure I was imagining… lay scrambled in front of me. My blood went cold and I started tearing up. As I looked down, I only stared at the note saying “Girlfriend?”.

Is the head real? It cant be… but what other explanation is there?

Maybe I don’t need to break up after all. Maybe its this fucking house. And I have to leave it right now. I have packed whatever essentials I would need and am ready to leave this place for good.

And I pray to god my boyfriend takes a fucking hint and leaves me alone.
