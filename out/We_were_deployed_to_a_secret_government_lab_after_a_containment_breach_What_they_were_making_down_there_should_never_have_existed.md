I can still smell the iron in the air. Blood has a way of clinging to your lungs — even when it’s not yours. I’m writing this because I don’t know if I’ll make it out of the woods alive. If anyone reads this, know that I didn’t run. I fought. God knows I tried.

We were a five-man squad — Commander Coleman, Torres, Fields, Matthews, and me. The call came in at 0300: an S.O.S. from Helixion Labs. “Containment breach. Multiple casualties.” Then static. HQ tried for hours to reestablish contact — nothing but dead air.

Coleman said it was probably a comms failure. I wish he’d been right.

Helixion wasn’t some civilian facility. It was government-funded, buried under fifty feet of reinforced concrete in the middle of nowhere. Genetic research, experimental evolution — stuff that was supposed to be decades away. I’d heard the rumors: gene-spliced animals, human-animal hybrids, soldiers built to survive anything. I thought it was sci-fi nonsense.

We touched down in a helicopter just outside the facility at dawn. The fog clung to the treeline like smoke. The main gate was open, one of the steel doors bent outward — as if something huge had pushed through. Coleman didn’t say a word. He just motioned for us to move in.

Inside, the power was down. Emergency lights bathed everything in a red glow. There was no sound except for the soft hum of our gear and the occasional hiss of steam from broken pipes. The deeper we went, the worse the smell got — burnt flesh, blood, and rot.

We found the first body near reception. A scientist, half his torso missing. His ribs were snapped outward like a blooming flower, his insides scattered across the floor. Blood smeared across the wall spelled one word: RUN.

Matthews muttered that it had to be an animal attack. Coleman snapped back, “No animal does this. Stay alert.”

We swept through the east hall — bullet casings, scorch marks, shredded lab coats. In one corner, a body was half-fused into the wall. Flesh and concrete blended seamlessly, like they’d been made of the same substance.

The elevators were twisted wrecks, so we took the maintenance stairs down to Sublevel 3 — Genetics Division. Every step echoed. My heart felt like it was trying to claw its way out of my chest.

Then we heard it — a scraping sound, metal on concrete. Fields swung his light down the corridor. For a second, I saw movement. Something pale, too fast to focus on. Coleman ordered a sweep. The sound stopped.

We found another body — or what was left of one. The bones were soft, bent at impossible angles. The skin was melting off like candle wax. Torres gagged. Then we heard breathing behind us.

It ducked under the doorframe as it entered. Its skin was translucent, pulsing faintly with veins of light. Its jaw hung unhinged, teeth black and needle-thin. But its eyes — Christ, those eyes — were aware.

Coleman fired first. It moved faster than anything I’ve ever seen. It was on Fields before we could blink, tearing into him with claws like bone shards. The sound it made wasn’t a roar — it was laughter. Distorted. Mechanical.

We opened fire. Bullets tore through it, but it didn’t fall. It screamed — a high-pitched shriek that made my vision blur. When it finally retreated into the vents, Fields was gone. All that was left was a pool of shredded flesh and blood.

In the control room, Coleman pulled up the logs. Most were corrupted. One still worked — a video feed from a containment cell. A man was strapped to a table, screaming. His skin split open like a cocoon, and something crawled out. Something like the thing that killed Fields.

The file name: Subject 47B – Regeneration Trial.

We didn’t speak for a long time.

Torres wanted to abort. Coleman refused. “We find survivors,” he said. “That’s the mission.”

On Sublevel 4, the air was thick with mist. The walls looked… organic. Like we were walking through a throat.

Matthews was leading when something dropped from the ceiling. Smaller this time, spider-like — but with a human face and its mouth sewn shut. It crawled on all fours, bones cracking with each movement. Matthews panicked and fired. The muzzle flash lit up a dozen more shapes clinging to the walls.

We ran. They chased us, screeching. One latched onto Torres’s leg. I turned and fired point-blank, blowing half of it off him — but its tendrils were already burrowing into his skin. He screamed until his voice became a gurgle.

They swarmed him, their tendrils writhing under his flesh, hollowing him out. When they finished, they dragged what was left of him up the wall — using him like an egg sac.

We sealed off Sublevel 4 and caught our breath.

Matthews’s tracker picked up faint readings — multiple signals moving slowly, erratically.

“Could be survivors,” I said, my voice cracking.

“Doubt it,” he replied. “No one could’ve survived this.”

Coleman sighed. “He’s right. But we check anyway.”

The signal led us to a chamber lined with hanging cables and broken speakers. The air was hot and wet, reeking of decay.

Then came the sound — faint at first, then rising.

Singing.

A soft, lilting melody, out of tune but hauntingly familiar.

A lullaby.

Matthews froze. “Is that—” he started, but stopped. The look on his face said he was hearing something else entirely.

The music swelled. The cables began to sway, first gently, then violently, jerking in rhythm with the song. Something wet splattered on Matthews’s shoulder.

He looked up — and froze. The ceiling wasn’t cables. It was flesh.

Dozens — maybe hundreds — of human mouths embedded in the surface. Lips cracked and twitching, teeth clicking in perfect harmony. Some mouthed silent words. Others sang in fractured tones. Their tongues stretched downward, questing through the air.

“Jesus Christ…” I whispered.

Then they screamed. All of them. The sound inverted, like suction turned inside out.

Matthews opened fire. Blood — or something like it — rained down in sheets, sizzling as it hit the floor. But the mouths didn’t stop. They formed words that didn’t belong to any language.

A tongue lashed down, wrapping around Matthews’s throat. He clawed at it, eyes bulging. I grabbed his legs and pulled — the tongue tore loose, but so did half his throat. He died in my arms.

The mouths laughed.

Coleman hurled an incendiary grenade. Fire consumed the ceiling, flesh popping like oil. The singing stopped, replaced by shrieks fading into silence.

When the smoke cleared, only Coleman and I were left.

In the security wing, the power flickered back on — just long enough to reveal what was inside the cells.

Not people. Not animals. Things caught mid-transformation. A child with reversed limbs. A faceless thing with rows of teeth spiraling down its neck. The glass was cracked.

That’s when I realized — these weren’t test subjects. They were soldiers. Failed prototypes. Helixion wasn’t trying to cure disease. They were trying to build evolution itself — and they succeeded.

Coleman made the call. “We end this here. No survivors. No evidence.”

We found the generator room. He planted the charges. I covered the door.

Then I heard breathing — from above.

It dropped down on Coleman, pinning him. It was different this time — bigger, more complete. Like the others had been prototypes, and this was the final product. Its body was a patchwork of people, stitched together perfectly. Its mouth opened vertically, splitting its head in half.

Coleman screamed for me to run. I hesitated. God help me, I hesitated.

“That’s an order, Martinez! RUN! Use the tunnel — code 8593! NOW GO!”

Then it tore him apart.

I fired until my rifle clicked empty. It didn’t flinch. It just stared — and spoke.

Not in words. In voices. Coleman, Torres, Fields, and Matthews. All screaming from its mouth at once.

I ran.

Coleman’s screams followed me, twisting into gurgles and a wet crack.

I don’t remember the keypad, or the tunnel. Only the trapdoor — and the woods.

The fog was thicker now. The air hummed like the earth itself was alive. Things moved in the trees.

Then the charges went off. The ground shook. Helixion collapsed in on itself. A plume of black smoke rose into the dawn.

But as I watched from the ridge… I saw shapes crawling out of the rubble. Dozens. Maybe hundreds.

It’s been three hours. My radio’s dead, and my phone is about to die. Can’t make any calls so hopefully this somehow makes it out.

The forest is silent again — too silent.

If anyone reads this, don’t send another team. Don’t send anyone.

Barricade your homes. Pray, if you still believe.

Because those abominations are free now.

And they’re hunting.
