I used to love the quiet of the night. That stillness, that feeling of the world pressing pause, if only for a few hours. But that was before. Before the tapping started.

The first time it happened, I woke up with a start. My heart was pounding, the room bathed in that bluish-grey light that comes just before dawn. I lay there, holding my breath, listening. It was so faint at first that I thought it might have been part of my dream. Just a gentle tapping sound, like a branch brushing against the window. But I live on the top floor. There are no trees outside.

I sat up, straining to hear it again, but all I could hear was the blood rushing in my ears. I tried to convince myself it was just my imagination, that I was still half-asleep. I laughed it off the next morning, but a strange unease settled over me, a creeping sense that something was wrong, though I couldn't quite put my finger on it.

The tapping came again the next night. And the next. Soft at first, almost polite, like someone knocking gently, insistently. I’d wake up in a sweat, pulse racing, ears straining in the dark. Each time, I'd switch on the lamp and scan the room, my eyes darting to the window. Always the window. The glass was cold to the touch, fogged with condensation. The latch was still locked. I’d stare into my own terrified reflection, searching for answers in the empty night beyond.

The nights stretched on, and I began to dread the sunset. It felt like the air grew thicker when darkness fell, like the shadows grew longer. The tapping never came at the same time; sometimes it would start right as I was about to drift off, other times it would wake me in the dead of night. But it always came.

By the fourth night, it was louder. More persistent. The sound was no longer a gentle knock. It was frantic, almost urgent, like someone trying to get my attention, demanding it. I could barely sleep, could barely think. I was losing time, hours slipping through my fingers. I’d find myself staring at the walls, at the floor, at the window, the window, always the window.

During the day, I could almost pretend everything was normal. Almost. But things started to slip. I’d find myself in places I didn’t remember walking to, with no memory of how I got there. I’d wake up in the mornings with bruises on my arms, my legs. Deep, dark marks that ached when I touched them. I’d tell myself it was just stress, or maybe I’d knocked into something in my daze, but there was a part of me, a small, frightened part, that knew better.

Then, things began to move around the apartment. Small things at first—a book I was sure I left on the table would be on the floor, my keys would end up in a different room. Once, I found the bathroom tap running when I knew I’d turned it off. Then the photographs on the wall started to tilt, ever so slightly. I tried to ignore it, to reason with myself, but the sense of being watched grew stronger. I could feel eyes on me, could feel a presence in the room with me, just out of sight.

I set up cameras around the apartment. I told myself it was just for peace of mind, to prove that nothing was there, but in truth, I was desperate to catch a glimpse of whatever it was. I wanted to see it, even though I was terrified of what I might find. I watched the footage every morning, every hour, my eyes bloodshot and stinging, but the tapes showed nothing. No movement. No figure. No tapping. Just me, alone, staring at the window, always at the window.

And then came the dreams. Or at least, I think they were dreams. It started with that tapping sound. Slow at first, a rhythmic knock that echoed through the empty halls of some place I didn’t recognise, some place that felt ancient, forgotten. I’d wander through dark corridors, my footsteps echoing, walls lined with peeling wallpaper and rusted frames. The smell of damp and decay filled my nostrils. I’d feel something behind me, close, too close. A shadow that moved with me, breathing down my neck.

I’d turn corners, run through rooms that seemed to stretch on forever, but I’d always end up back at the same place. A single door at the end of a long hallway, and behind it, the tapping. It would get louder and louder until it felt like it was coming from inside my own skull, like my brain was rattling against my bones. I’d reach for the door, my hand shaking, but just as I touched the handle, I’d wake up, drenched in sweat, gasping for breath.

I started losing days. Whole chunks of time missing, hours disappearing like smoke in the wind. I’d find myself standing in front of the window, staring out at the street below, my face pressed against the glass, my breath fogging up the surface. I’d snap out of it, heart racing, and I’d find scratch marks on the window pane. Long, jagged lines like something was trying to claw its way in. Or… out?

I told my friend about it one day. I tried to laugh it off, but she noticed the dark circles under my eyes, the tremor in my hands. She stayed over one night to keep me company, to prove that there was nothing to fear. But that night, the tapping grew frantic. Harder. More violent. She heard it too. Her face went pale, her eyes wide. “Is that… the wind?” she whispered. But I could see it in her eyes. She knew. She could feel it, too. Whatever was out there wasn’t the wind.

And then we saw it. A face, pale and distorted, pressed up against the window. It was there for only a second, but I know we both saw it. She screamed, and I felt something cold grip my heart. When I ran to the window, there was nothing there. Just my reflection, staring back at me, wide-eyed and haunted. She left in a hurry, and I haven’t heard from her since.

I stopped going to work. Stopped answering my phone. I barricaded myself in the apartment, covered every window with thick, dark sheets, sealed every crack and crevice. But the tapping continued. Louder now, more insistent. I could hear whispers sometimes, faint and just out of reach. I couldn’t make out the words, but they were getting clearer. Getting closer.

The nights blurred together into one long, waking nightmare. I stopped eating, stopped drinking. I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the window, the window where it all began. The window that seemed to pulse with a life of its own, breathing in time with me, taunting me with its silence.

Then, last night, I heard something different. Not just tapping this time, but a scratching. Slow and deliberate. The sound of nails dragging across the glass, carving letters I couldn’t see. I watched, paralysed, as the glass began to crack, hairline fractures spreading like spiderwebs. And then, through the gaps, I saw it. Not a face, but an eye. Just one eye, bloodshot and unblinking, staring directly at me.

I screamed. I threw whatever I could find at the window, but it didn’t shatter. The eye blinked once, slowly, and then… it smiled. Not a human smile, not really, but something that stretched the skin in impossible ways, something that twisted and curled at the edges. And then it whispered my name. I swear to God, it whispered my name.

I stumbled backward, my mind reeling, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. I don’t know what it is. I don’t know what it wants. I’ve tried looking up stories, searching for answers. I found something about an old legend, about things that live in places forgotten by time, that feed on fear. But nothing concrete. Nothing that makes sense.

I don’t know if it’s a spirit, a demon, or something else entirely. Something older. Something that doesn’t belong in our world. I don’t even know if it’s real anymore, if any of this is real, if I’m real. I feel like I’m losing myself, like I’m slipping into some other place, some dark, twisted reflection of my own reality.

Tonight, I’ve decided I won’t sleep. I won’t let it take me. I’ve bolted every door, sealed every window, and I’m sitting here with the lights on, with a knife in my hand. But the tapping has started again. It’s louder than ever now, almost deafening. The walls are shaking, and I can hear something moving, scraping against the walls, whispering my name over and over.

The window is cracking again. I can see the fractures spreading, can see the shadows shifting, twisting, reaching for me. I don’t know what’s coming. I don’t know what’s out there. But I can feel it. It’s almost here. I can hear it, feel it pressing against the glass, feel its breath on my skin.

God, I can see it now. I can see it coming through. And I don’t know if I’ll survive this. I don’t know if I’ll make it through the night. But if you find this, if you hear the tapping… Don’t look at the window. Don’t listen to the whispers. Don’t let it in.

Because it’s waiting. It’s always waiting.

And it knows your name.
