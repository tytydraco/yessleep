I ran a YouTube channel with my two friends, Patrick and Damien. Our latest video idea was to explore Eastlake High- our old school. It had shut down during our final year after a teacher was murdered. The place had already been struggling financially, and after the incident, the district decided to absorb it into another school instead of fixing it up.


We knew how to get in. The security was lax- no cameras, no patrols. I had cut a hole at the bottom of the wire fence with bolt cutters, just wide enough for us to squeeze through. We slid our bags under first, then crawled in after. Patrick, our worst cameraman, insisted on filming the exterior shots, which meant he was nervous and wanted to scope out potential hiding spots.


The school was in worse shape than we remembered. Weeds poked through cracks in the pavement, vines crawled up the faded brick walls, and graffiti marred the already shattered windows. It had never been the biggest or best-funded school, but seeing it like this- a decaying husk- felt wrong. As if something had been growing here, like a defiant mould.


Damien suggested we jump straight into filming our hide-and-seek challenge while our nerves were still fresh. We drew straws, and Damien got the short one, meaning he had to be the seeker. Before we split up, I reminded everyone to mute their phones to avoid giving away our spots. Damien started a five-minute timer, and Patrick and I sprinted off in opposite directions.


I remembered getting lost once on my way to science class. There was a shortcut through the old teacher’s lounge, and tucked away in that area was a storage closet used for PPE equipment. Most of it had probably been stolen by now, but it was the perfect hiding spot. I slipped inside, closing the door behind me, and crouched between empty shelves, my breath shallow as I listened to the silence settle.


Then, footsteps.


I tensed. Damien was good, but there was no way he’d found me this fast. A flashlight beam swept across the floor outside the closet. My pulse hammered in my ears as I peered through the narrow gap in the door.


An older man, maybe in his fifties, stood in the room, wearing a green sweater vest.


Mr. Davey.


My breath caught. It couldn’t be. Mr. Davey had been my old science teacher, and it was due to his death that the school shutdown.


But there he was, standing just a few feet away, his head tilted as he sniffed the air like an animal tracking prey. My stomach twisted as he took slow, deliberate steps toward the closet. His eyes darted, his nostrils flared. He was going to find me.


Then, there was a loud metal clang.


It came from somewhere deeper in the school. The Mr. Davey lookalike snapped his head toward the noise before sprinting off in that direction. I stayed frozen, my body refusing to move until the sound of his footsteps faded. Then, as quietly as I could, I slipped out through a nearby window and pulled out my phone.


Five missed calls and two texts from Damien.


- There’s someone here. Get out NOW.

- I found a phone. I think it's Patrick’s- Is he with you?

My stomach dropped. I bolted toward our entry point. Damien was already there, pacing by the fence, his face pale in the moonlight.


“Did you see Patrick?” he asked.


I shook my head. “No, but I heard something get knocked over- I think.”


We debated going back in to look for him. Every instinct screamed at me to leave, but Patrick was still inside. We had to try. We retraced our steps, calling his name, our voices swallowed by the empty hallways. The only thing we found was his phone, lying on the floor near an overturned desk.


Before calling the police, we checked the footage.


We skipped to the end.


Patrick was hiding under a desk. The camera, still recording, captured two pairs of shoes stopping in front of him.


“Okay, you found me,” Patrick’s voice said, shaky but amused as he prepared to stand. Then, after a pause, his tone changed. “Wait… What are you doing here?”


A sickening snap echoed through the speakers.


Damien and I ran out of the school and called the police. They refused to comment on Patrick or tell us anything they found, but I overheard one of the cops telling another that "It looked like the boy had been eaten."
