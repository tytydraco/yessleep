We mourned the day only because it was custom. In staging our grief, we paid remembrance to the founders of our town -who were hanged because of their dissident of the state's government- with florals we did not know or care which of them were appropriate. 


But these men were said to have been the best of us so any speaking out against the excessive ritual of the charade would have been unprofitable. Though, in everyone's hatred of the day, it showed itself in the atmosphere until everyone got the willies. 


The celebrations did not end without a scene: I had taken early leave from my parents’ dinner and their unbearable guests. I then meandered unfocused through the muddy flooded trail path that ended at Tom's Overstreet Irish Pub.


The pub was a reckless thing, with Tom having to formally apologize in the paper for lying about being Irish. Really he had been forgiven but Tom still felt obligated to give excessive discounts. This call of cheap - yet fine - drinks lured me and there I stayed until midnight…


"Do you think maybe I can have a little bit of water at this point? I'm getting dizzy."


“Yeah. Let me just, hold on. Let me just leave the tape running so we're not accused of editing anything by the defense."


I left the officer and became lost three times on my way to the bathroom. His instructions weren't exactly clear and I had held my urine for so long that I felt no relief when I finally peed. Damn it! I just wanted to go home and forget all of this shit but I remembered Tom's slashed face and his cut out tongue being thrown into a barrel of spirits. 


Tom was the best of us and I had no choice but to try to get justice for him. 


"I was saying…"


“You were saying that two unknowns walked in the pub and immediately shot a patron. Didn't even demand anything, just started with a kill.”


"Okay. That's right. I've always supposed they did that first kill to show they weren't fucking around. Most of us immediately ran out but I was left with just Tom. I couldn't move, you know. I was scared out of my mind and by the time I could move, they started to do…what they did…to Tom. Just started slashing and shooting away."


I drank more water and wished it weren't so cold. My teeth hurt.


"Then I really got scared. Of course I'd be next. Of course I couldn't move. 



But I remembered my parents. It's absolutely incredible how when you're afraid you forget the existence of everyone but yourself. Somehow I remembered them and their next month's anniversary party. 'Dance the Jubilee' is what they called it. In the paper and in their invite cards."


“Thinking of the future gave you the strength to run?”


"Yes but not immediately. I'd already been tied up by the freaks and cut to hell before my parents came to mind. I was going to just die, just let them kill me, but I began to really value my life thinking of that dance and all the love my parents would get from the community. They deserved that kind of adoration. So I willed myself the strength and I broke through the ties around my wrists"


I should have never went to that pub. Or, I should have been smart and quick enough to run with everyone else. Where did they go anyway? Not immediately to the police, that's for sure.


"I have to say I was surprised at how easy they were to remove. I stood up too quickly and nearly fainted. Tom was screaming again and I could have helped him - I should have helped him- but I was afraid. Could I save myself twice? I didn't know. 


I ran out of the pub unnoticed and was so tired I passed out only steps from the police station. You know that, though."


"Yes, I know. Would you like an umbrella? It's raining on your head."


Then, just then, I felt the blood gush from my eye and my pants were wet. I had soiled myself from the pain. I saw Tom crawling towards the door. If I didn't lose my life in this, I'd certainly lose my mind.


I was overcome with confusion and disgust at the odor of blood. 
Three different people with three different lifestyles had blood stinking up the place.


I settled myself into gradually accepting I had never left the pub.


The two men finished toying with Tom and dragged him back to the inner part of the bar. He saw me. We made prolonged eye contact as the strange men chattered about their, "momma" and "pappa".


They were not all there in the mind, and were two eggs short of a dozen. Somehow they became fixated on Tom, to my great luck.


I suppose that yes, I could have helped Tom. He was the best of us. But my parents. My life. My hope in the dance that gave me strength. It would not be moot.


I escaped the pub but I didn't escape Tom. Every night I have been dreaming of him and his cut up face. I swore to my psychiatrist that I've seen him crawling around in my living room, trying to reach my front door. And so my psychiatrist swore that if I didn't begin a course of antipsychotics, he'd hospitalize me. 


Then he saw Tom himself, in a session with me. I had to look for a new doctor because both of us were involuntarily committed after that.


Now today is the ten year anniversary of the pub murders and the entire town is mourning the day. We are staging our grief because we're focused on the dance tonight, the second Jubilee dance to be thrown by my parents. 


It's their 60th anniversary so of course I'm going to be there. But not before I burn Tom's old pub down, because something in the atmosphere is giving me the willies.
