I believe everyone has something they’re scared of.

Clowns, bugs, colors. Yes, colors. Ask my uncle Nick—he’s terrified of pink. A grown man paralyzed by the sight of bubblegum. Once, at a niece’s birthday party, he passed out cold just because the clown handed him a bouquet of pink balloons. The brain is funny like that—so fragile, so precise in its irrationality.

Me? I have Haphephobia. The fear of being touched.

Go ahead, laugh. Most people do at first. Until they try to shake my hand and I flinch like they’ve pulled a knife. Until they see me panic when someone brushes past me in a crowd. It’s not a quirk. It’s not a preference. It’s a condition.

“How do you function in society?” they ask.

I manage. I keep to myself. The people around me know the rules—don’t touch me. Don’t get close. My home is my sanctuary, the one place I’m in control.

But you know what’s funny?

We live in a world where “no” doesn’t always mean “no.” Where boundaries are suggestions, not laws. Especially with men. Not all men, sure—but enough. Enough that I stopped feeling safe a long time ago. Enough that I learned how to disappear in plain sight.

And lucky for me, my job allows for that.

I work in home security.

Not the kind where I come to your house and install a camera. No. I manage remote access systems. I monitor home feeds, patch firmware vulnerabilities, override alarms when the owners lock themselves out. I see everything. I know everything.

And most importantly? I watch.

Do you know how easy it is to see someone for who they really are when they think they’re alone? You wouldn’t believe the things people do in their “safe spaces.” The things they hide from even themselves.

Over time, I started becoming… curious. About fear.

See, it started with a break-in. A client’s daughter got locked in the bathroom during a home invasion. The footage showed her screaming, shaking, losing control. She was terrified—not of the intruder—but of the dark. Classic Nyctophobia. Something about the total absence of light paralyzed her more than the threat itself.

It stayed with me.

I wanted to understand more. How fear grips people. So I began researching phobias. At first, clinically. Articles. Videos. But that wasn’t enough. I wanted to see it. I wanted to feel it. Real fear. Raw. Unfiltered.

That’s when I met Suzy.

We talked online. Shared memes. Trauma. She thought I was just another shut-in with social anxiety. She told me her younger sister had an extreme fear of frogs. Ranidaphobia. Even seeing one on a screen made her gag. Apparently, when they were kids, a cousin locked her in a greenhouse with a few bullfrogs and she fainted. It stuck.

I asked questions. I took notes. Then, I made a plan.

Suzy didn’t know it, of course. But her sister—Aly—was going to help me understand fear.

I watched their home for weeks. Studied the layout. Their habits. The way Aly took the trash out barefoot at midnight. The way she always propped the door open with a brick. No alarms. No cameras. A perfect test site.

One night, I waited. Knocked her out when she came back in. Quick. Quiet. She didn’t even see my face.

She woke up in a basement filled with frogs. Tiny ones. Fat ones. Vibrant green, warty brown, even those translucent albino kinds that look like ghost skin. I covered the floor, the shelves, even the ceiling rafters. The walls were soundproofed. The door was sealed.

She screamed so loud it vibrated the camera feed.

The footage was beautiful.

She clawed at her skin. Tried to climb the walls. At one point, she tried to eat one, just to end it. But the best part? She texted Suzy. I must’ve missed her phone in the panic.

Suzy started blowing up my DMs. “My sister’s gone.” “She says she’s trapped.” “She says there are frogs.”

I told her I’d help. Told her I’d check their home security. I acted concerned.

And Suzy, sweet naive Suzy, gave me her address.

I brought flowers. Said I was from the company.

Now she’s in the basement too.

I let Aly go. Gave her a sedative. Dropped her near a hospital. She won’t talk. They never do. Who would believe her? A room of frogs? She’ll get institutionalized at best.

But Suzy? She’s been more… resistant.

Last night, she started talking. Whispering, actually. Said she figured it out. Said she knows who I am.

So I took her eyes.

It’s hard to see fear when you have no eyes. But you can still feel it. Especially when your hearing sharpens. She can hear the frogs. She can feel them hop across her skin. She can smell them.

She won’t be a long-term subject. But she’ll serve her purpose.

Now I’m looking for the next one.

You seem interested. You’ve read this far, haven’t you?

So tell me…

What’s your phobia?

Don’t worry. I’ll find out eventually.
