I’ve worked the graveyard shift at St. Jude’s University for six years. Most people think being a janitor is about scrubbing floors and emptying trash, but at a place this old, it’s mostly about knowing which sounds to ignore. The steam pipes hiss like they’re whispering secrets, and the old floorboards groan under ghosts of students long gone. I like the quiet. Or, I used to.

My route covers the Life Sciences building. It’s a labyrinth of linoleum and fluorescent lights that buzz with a headache-inducing hum. The basement is the worst part—a maze of storage rooms and heavy, lead-lined doors. My supervisor, a grizzled guy named Artie who’s been here since the seventies, gave me one specific instruction when I started: "If you’re mopping the North Hallway and you see a door without a room number, keep mopping. Don't look at it, and for God’s sake, don't walk through it."

For six years, I followed that rule. I’d mop the North Hallway, see the faint outline of a heavy oak door appearing in the reflection of the wet floor, and I’d look at my boots until the tiles dried and the door vanished. But last night, the pipes in the ceiling burst.

The North Hallway was flooded. I was standing in three inches of water, the reflection so clear it was like looking into a mirror. And there it was. The door. It wasn't just a faint outline anymore; it was solid, dark wood with a brass handle that looked like a screaming face. The smell hit me then—not the smell of old paper or chemical cleaners, but the scent of ozone and wet earth.

I should have walked away. I should have called Artie. But the door was slightly ajar, and I could hear a sound coming from inside. It was a rhythmic thump-thump, like a heartbeat slowed down to a crawl. Against every instinct I had, I pushed the door open.

The room inside shouldn't have fit within the building’s foundations. It was a vast, circular chamber lined with thousands of glass jars. I stepped inside, the water from the hallway following me like it was alive. Each jar contained something pulsing—grey, brain-like masses connected by thin, copper wires. They weren't just sitting there; they were communicating. The wires hummed with a low frequency that made my teeth ache.

In the center of the room was a desk. Sitting there was a man wearing a janitor’s uniform exactly like mine. His back was to me.

"Artie?" I whispered.

The figure didn't turn. "The floors have to stay wet," the voice said. It sounded like Artie, but hollow, as if the words were being played through an old, broken speaker. "The moisture conducts the memory. Without the water, the jars go dry. And when they go dry, the university forgets."

I moved closer, my heart hammering against my ribs. "Forgets what?"

The man finally turned around. It wasn't Artie. It wasn't anyone. It was a hollow shell made of the same grey mass I saw in the jars, shaped into the likeness of a man. It had no eyes, just deep sockets filled with that pulsing copper wire.

"It forgets us," the thing said. It reached out a hand, its fingers elongating like melting wax. "We are the maintenance. We are the ones who keep the history from evaporating. Every student who fails, every professor who disappears... they end up in the jars. Their thoughts keep the lights on upstairs."

I backed away, stumbling into the water. The door started to creak shut. The thing at the desk stood up, its movements jerky and unnatural. It wasn't trying to attack me; it was trying to hand me a mop.

"Your shift isn't over," it hissed. "The North Hallway is drying. If it dries, you’ll be the next one in a jar."

I bolted. I dived through the closing door and landed hard on the wet linoleum of the hallway. I didn't stop running until I reached the security office. I told them there was a flood, a break-in, anything to get them down there.

When we returned, the hallway was bone-dry. The burst pipe was sealed as if it had never leaked. And the door? It was gone. Not even a mark on the wall.

Artie was there, leaning against his cart, sipping coffee. He looked at me, his eyes cold and knowing. He didn't say a word. He just handed me a bucket and pointed back toward the North Hallway.

I’m writing this from the breakroom. I have three hours left on my shift. My hands won't stop shaking, and my teeth still ache from that humming sound. But the worst part is looking down at my own reflection in the bucket of soapy water.

Just for a second, I didn't see my eyes. I saw copper wires.

The floor is starting to dry. I have to go back. I have to keep it wet
