It had been  several days since the hospital. Life went back to its strange version of normal, students returning to classes, the monotonous routine of Job Corps dragging us through the days. But nothing felt the same. Every hallway seemed a little darker, every corner a little emptier. People kept their distance from us, not out of malice, but out of a shared discomfort no one was willing to name.

We were sitting around the campfire one evening, just trying to pretend everything was okay. Tony and I were still the ones most shaken by what happened, but no one could completely shake the feeling. It was like we all carried this weight, an unspoken thing we weren’t allowed to talk about.

“Have you guys noticed anything weird?” Andre asked, poking the fire with a stick. He glanced around at us, eyes darting between each of us. “You know… like, since the hospital?”

Kelsey, sitting next to him, shivered and hugged her knees. “I don’t know. I keep hearing things at night. It’s probably just the wind, but…”

“You hear that too?” Tony interjected, his voice tense. “I thought I was losing it, but I swear I hear stuff at night. Like footsteps… but no one’s there.”

The fire crackled, and for a moment, no one spoke. The air was thick with the tension that had been building since the night we ran from the hospital. The shadows around the campfire flickered, almost alive in the firelight. A sharp, pungent smell started to fill the air, but we ignored it.

“Where do you think she went?” Kelsey asked, voice tight. “I mean… she was gone the next day. And no one even knows why. I thought she was just staying with family or something, but…” She trailed off, unsure how to finish.

“Maybe she just couldn’t handle it,” I said quietly, but it felt wrong coming out of my mouth. The words sounded hollow, and the doubt in my voice made me uncomfortable. “She’s been through a lot.”

Tony shifted uncomfortably beside me. “You think she left because of us? I don’t know… she was… she was different that night. Like she was… scared. She kept looking over her shoulder, like she was afraid someone was following her.”

“And… she hasn’t been picking up my texts.” Tony added.

There was a long silence. The fire crackled louder in the quiet, but it only seemed to deepen the sense of unease in the air.

“Do you think she’s okay?” I asked, breaking the silence.

“No,” Tony muttered, shaking his head. “I think she got out before whatever’s still in that hospital got to her. But we’re not so lucky. I feel it, man.”

The night stretched on, each of us lost in our thoughts. The fire burned low, casting long shadows, and the wind began to pick up again, sending leaves rustling across the ground.

It wasn’t until we returned to our rooms after the campfire that everything took a darker turn. Tony was the first to notice the note slipped under our door, sitting there like it had always belonged.

The moment I picked it up, I knew it wasn’t from Rachael. It couldn’t be. The handwriting was too neat, too deliberate, and there was a chilling purpose in the message it carried.

“You’ve seen what’s in the hospital. She’s still here. You haven’t seen everything. The real answers lie beneath. Come alone. We’ll be waiting.”

The words hit me like a punch to the gut. My chest tightened as I read it again, my fingers trembling slightly. I could feel Tony’s presence beside me, silent and stiff.

“This… this can’t be real,” he said, finally breaking the silence. “Who would even? This has to be some sick prank.”

I shook my head, my voice low. “What if it’s not?”

The door swung open, and Andre, Lex, and Kelsey stepped in, their faces falling instantly at the sight of us. Lex narrowed his eyes at the note in my hand. “What’s that?”

Tony answered before I could. “Someone’s messing with us,” he said, his voice hard but edged with fear. “Or maybe it’s whoever’s behind all that crap in the hospital.”

“No,” I said firmly, holding up the note. “This is more than just a joke. It’s from whoever’s behind everything, the experiments, the hospital… and Rachael’s disappearance.”

The room fell into heavy silence. Kelsey stepped closer, her face pale, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. “But what does it mean?” she asked, her voice trembling. “What do they want with us?”

“They want us back there,” Andre muttered, his jaw tightening as he glanced around the room. “It’s bigger than we thought.”

“‘The real answers lie beneath,” Lex read aloud, his voice dripping with unease. “That’s the tunnels. They’re talking about the tunnels, aren’t they?”

No one had to answer, we all felt it. The note had left us no choice but to go back. If there was even a chance Rachael was still in there, we couldn’t just leave her. And if the note was right, we hadn’t seen everything yet.

But the last part, “Come alone. We’ll be waiting”, hung in the air like a warning, a shadow lingering over every other thought.

“I’ll go alone,” I said suddenly, my voice cutting through the tense silence. The words felt foreign, like they weren’t my own, but deep down I knew it was the only way. Whoever had left the note wasn’t going to give us any answers unless they got what they wanted.

Tony grabbed my arm, his face pale. “Don’t be stupid. You don’t know what’s down there. It’s probably a trap.”

“I know,” I replied, my voice soft but resolute. “But we need answers. We can’t just sit here and act like none of this is happening. Not after what we saw.”

“Maybe I should be the one to go then,” Toney said, “I’m the one who pushed us to go to the hospital in the first  place. It’s my fault Rachael was left behind.”

Andre stepped forward, his expression hard. “Neither of you are going alone. If this is real, we stick together. We’re not letting anyone take this on by themselves.”

“It’s not up for discussion The note clearly said,” I started, but Lex interrupted me before I could finish.

“Enough,” he snapped. “We’re all going. That’s it.”

He looked at Andre, and Andre nodded. “You’re not talking your way out of this, man. If there’s something down there, we’re going to face it together.”

I glanced at Kelsey, who had been silent, her eyes wide and brimming with fear. She took a deep breath and gave a hesitant nod. “I’m in too. We need to know what happened to Rachael.”

I exhaled slowly, the knot in my chest loosening, “Alright,” I said finally. “We do this together. But we have to be careful. We don’t know what’s waiting for us down there.”

Andre read the note again, his brow furrowing. “The tunnels,” he said softly. “They’re the key to all of this. Whatever’s down there… that’s where we’ll find the truth.”

No one disagreed. For the first time since all of this began, we felt a grim sense of unity, a shared determination that bound us together. We didn’t know what awaited us beneath the hospital, but we knew one thing for sure. We couldn’t turn back now.

A thick fog enveloped the campus the next morning, blanketing the grounds in a pale gray haze. The usual sounds of laughter and chatter from students were silent, replaced by an eerie quiet that seemed to seep into everything.

We gathered in the rec room. Tony, Andre, Lex, Kelsey, and me. We knew we needed to plan this carefully. None of us could ignore the weight of the note or the danger we all knew we were walking into.

“We need to pack light,” Andre said, breaking the silence as he unfolded a crude map of the hospital grounds we’d snagged from maintenance. His finger traced the faint lines of the tunnel entrance inside the hospital. “If this is where they want us to go, we need to be able to move quickly. I’m guessing there’s no easy way out if things go south.”

Tony leaned back against the wall, arms crossed, his expression grim. “We don’t even know what’s down there. For all we know, it could be crawling with… whatever the hell those things were.” He shuddered, his voice trailing off.

“They weren’t things,” I said quietly, my eyes fixed on the map. “They were people. And if there’s any chance Rachael’s still alive down there…” I didn’t finish the thought.

Lex, pacing by the window, glanced back at us. “This is suicide, you know. We don’t have weapons, and we’re walking into a trap because of a damn note.”

Kelsey shot him a sharp look. “And what’s your plan, Lex? Just sit here and hope whoever left that note decides to leave us alone? You saw what they’re capable of. If we don’t go, it’s only a matter of time before they come for us. Besides, you and I both know we can’t abandon Rachael.”

Lex didn’t respond, his jaw tightening as he turned back to the window.

“We don’t have to go in blind,” Andre said, trying to steady the group. “We know the tunnels connect to the main hospital, and we know the system down there leads all over campus. If we stick together and stay focused, we might stand a chance.”

Tony rubbed his temples, his voice strained. “We need supplies. Flashlights, first aid, anything we can use to defend ourselves. If this is as bad as it feels, we’re not walking out of there without a fight.”

I nodded, finally pulling myself out of my thoughts. “Alright. We divide up the list. Kelsey, you and Lex gather food and water from the cafeteria. Andre, find as many flashlights and batteries as you can. Tony and I will hit maintenance again and see if we can scrounge up anything that can be used as a weapon.”

Lex scoffed. “Weapons? You mean like, a wrench or something? Yeah, that’ll work against… whatever the hell’s down there.”

“Do you have a better idea?” I snapped, my patience wearing thin.

He didn’t respond, just muttered something under his breath and grabbed his jacket.

The group began to disperse, but before anyone could leave, Kelsey stopped us. “Wait,” she said, her voice shaking slightly. “We need to be careful tonight. No splitting up once we’re inside. And… if anything feels wrong, we leave. No heroics. This isn’t a cliche horror movie.”

Everyone nodded, even Lex, though he looked reluctant.

As we went our separate ways to gather supplies, the fog outside seemed to grow thicker, swallowing the campus in an unnatural stillness. It felt like the world was shrinking around us, pulling us closer to the hospital, to the tunnels, to whatever lay beneath.

In the back of my mind, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was only the beginning. The note had said, “Come alone,” but there was no way I was facing this without the others. Whoever, or whatever, was waiting for us beneath the hospital would have to face all of us.

Still, as I packed my bag and checked over my flashlight, I couldn’t help but feel the gnawing weight of doubt. We were walking into the unknown, and for all our planning, I wasn’t sure any of us were ready for what we might find.
