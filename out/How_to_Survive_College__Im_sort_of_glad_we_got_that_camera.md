I’ve been avoiding Grayson and I promise you it’s not just because I don’t want to talk to him.  I don’t have a great track record for that so you’re just going to have to believe me that it’s really not my normal avoidance strategy.  I’m frightened.  Legitimately frightened.  I’ve been replaying every interaction I’ve ever had with Grayson over and over in my head and trying to figure out what I missed.  He acts very human.

All the dangerous inhumans do.  They act human up until they’re not.

Worse, I don’t know what rules to follow with him.  This campus has some nods to existing traditions, but it’s not populated by creatures I’d recognize.  The university is actively keeping them out, in fact.  Eliminating the competition.  Letting something new grow.  Like planting an invasive species in the yard and letting it run rampant until it’s choked out anything that isn’t it.  

Can Grayson lie?  Is he bound by hospitality rules?  Is he bound by anything?

I don’t know.

So I don’t know what to do.

Perhaps he’s trapped in this endless cycle just like the university president is.  Maybe he’s just another ghost, hopping from body to body, looking for a way out.  He keeps talking about wanting to graduate and leave this place.  The university president found his own way to escape.  Maybe Grayson is doing the same thing.  Just trying to get out.  Because if the timeline between when James died is right, then it means Grayson has been about to graduate for a while now.

I want to believe that theory.  It’s the most comforting, because it means that Grayson isn’t dangerous.  Just… trapped.

I can’t afford to believe it though.  Underestimating the inhuman is how people get killed.  I’ve already had too many close calls for my liking.  Grayson could be the most dangerous of everything on campus, because I want to trust him, I want to help him.

So I’m avoiding him.  I don’t trust myself or my emotions and that means until I understand what is happening better, I need to keep my distance.

To help with this, I’ve told both Maria and Cassie.  

I called a friend group meeting and we met up at my apartment one night and ordered pizza.  Then once we were done complaining about classes and our jobs (incredibly, I’m still working at the dining hall, because I want pocket money and also guilt) (also while Cassie doesn’t have a part-time job, Maria does) I got right into the problem.

“Grayson isn’t human,” I said.

At which point Maria jumped from her chair, shrieking ‘I KNEW IT’ so I guess she’s not the only one that’s been harboring suspicions.  Though, once she calmed down, she admitted that she didn’t start wondering that until after the revelations about the university president.  It only seemed logical in her mind that if the president was something inhuman, then it was very possible something weird was going on with Grayson.  Still, she didn’t feel firmly enough about it to say anything.  The adoption angle seemed more plausible to her.

We all wanted to like him.

“But if he’s like the president,” I said, “then why isn’t he rotting?”

“Maybe they swap out the body more often.  Grayson would only have four years before they needed a new body.”

That didn’t match the timelines the Folklore Society had found though.  So either they were finding a way to make Grayson’s body last longer - they could conceivably start him over as a freshman in a new program and do that a couple times so the professors don’t notice him showing up over and over - or we were missing a lot of dead students.

Considering how hard it’s been for the Folklore Society to find evidence of Grayson’s existence it could go either way, really.

“Who the hell is ‘they’, anyway?” Maria demanded.  “That seems important.”

“I’m pretty sure it’s the board at this point,” I said.  “Grayson said that they’re really the ones running everything.”

We paused a moment to consider that, most likely all conjuring the exact same mental image of a group of faceless old men in suits with a ritualistic circle drawn on their board table, transferring Grayson’s spirit from one corpse to another.

“The logistics really aren’t as important as what we’re going to do about it now,” Cassie said.

Which was a great question.  What did we do about Grayson?  In the end, none of us had a good answer.  Maria wanted to at least inform the Folklore Society that finding out as much as they could about the university president’s son was now our top priority.  I also gave her permission to relay a summary of my encounter with the thing in the hallway, so they would know we were at least trying to uphold our end of the bargain.  Cassie’s suggestion was to practice strength in numbers where Grayson was concerned from here on.  No one got to spend time with him alone anymore.  I was obviously most at risk for that, since even though we’d called it quits on a formally dating relationship I still knew him the best and spent the most time with him.

And my contribution?  I was going to enlist Professor Monotone for more help.  We didn’t know for certain where he stood with the university, but I was getting the impression that he only tolerated the inhuman occurrences around here.  Tolerated, but didn’t approve, and certainly didn’t assist.  Besides, he deserved to know about James.  I didn’t tell him at the moment because I was too shocked, but now that I’ve had time to process I feel it’s only right if he knows.

So that was our plan.  Maria would get in touch with the Folklore Society that evening and I’d go talk to Professor Monotone the next morning.

As many of you have pointed out, we make a great team.

Cassie turned to me after shutting the door behind Maria.

“Ashley, I say this with all the love in the world,” she said evenly, “but you do not know how to pick them.”

I got a bit flustered until she clarified that was a joke.  Which honestly did make me feel better about this entire situation.  It was awful and we didn’t know what to do, but no one was blaming me and we were going to figure it out together.

I wish I could say that I’d talked to Professor Monotone and he’d given me all the answers, or at the very least, we had another person trying to dig up information on Grayson and the university.  However, while I was walking to his office for his office hours, something more urgent came up.

I blinked and I was somewhere cold and dark.

That’s it.  That’s what I remember.  One moment I was walking towards the geology building, the next second I was standing in a dark room, shivering faintly from the chill.

It took a moment to understand my surroundings.  I stood there, frozen stock still, staring with wide eyes as if that could coerce enough light into them to make anything out in the darkness around me.  The air felt damp and humid, sticking in my chest like taffy.  There was a bitter taste in my mouth.

Very rarely, my freeze response works in my favor.  This was one of those times.  It kept me locked in place, my mind whirling, as I tried to replay the events leading up to the present moment and deciphering how it had happened.  My memory loss, I thought.  This must be another memory gap, except this time, it’d deposited me in a location I couldn’t fill in the gaps for.  Walking across campus - easy enough to insert a false memory.  I’d walked those paths enough times by now that my mind could easily recalibrate if I was a bit further along on the walk than I remembered.  But here, in absolute darkness, there was nothing that could fill in the blank spots.  

No.  Not quite absolute darkness.  There.  Light.  A faint red haze, but light nonetheless.  I edged towards it, sliding my foot forward without picking it up from the cement floor beneath me.  I felt the way forwards with my toes, holding my arms up in front of me to make sure I didn’t run into anything.  I crept along at an agonizingly slow pace, my heartbeat singing in my ears, until I reached the edge of that pale glow.

Ahead of me was a brick wall and a heavy iron door.  The glow came from a red exit light illuminating a scant handful of feet around it.

I recognized the wall.  The cement floor.  And I even recognized the shape and weight of the door.

I was in the power station basement.

The door in front of me was locked.  I pulled on it, I slammed my shoulder against it, I rattled it in its hinges in the vain hope that I could jar it open.  It remained stubbornly shut, the deadbolt resisting the full weight of my body thrown against it.  My shoulder ached with the impact.  I paused to catch my breath and tried to swallow my panic, my desperate need to get out of here as quickly as possible.  I couldn’t fight my way out.  I had to reason a way out of this predicament instead, which meant setting aside my fear for a moment and making myself cold and calm for as long as it took to escape.

I got into the basement somehow.  So there had to be a way out.  It just wasn’t through this door.  There were multiple entrances, after all.  This must be the door that led to the interior of the power plant.  I needed to find the one that led to the staircase that connected directly with the outside.

At least now I had a wall to follow.  I placed my hand on the brick surface, feeling moisture beading beneath my fingertips.  I walked slowly, reluctant to leave this little circle of light and venture back into the absolute darkness.  It was like the world ended at the edge of the red glow and when dealing with the inhuman, it was entirely possible that my world did end right there.  I ran through the plan in my head to give me courage.  Follow the wall.  Keep one hand on it at all times.  Walk by sliding my feet forward so I couldn’t be tripped up by any unevenness in the floor.  Keep going until I find the door leading outside.

I took a deep breath and stepped into the darkness.  I kept my gaze straight ahead, stubbornly resisting the urge to look behind me.  It felt like I was walking for far longer than it should take to cross the basement.  The darkness pressed in around me, like a blanket that threatened to smother me.  I could feel it on my skin.  I took slow, even breaths, trying to drown the panic bubbling up in my chest.  I was taking small steps.  My perception of time was being distorted by my fear.  This was going to feel like it took a lot longer than it should, so I shouldn’t be surprised that I was still trapped in the dark and the way out of here wasn’t in sight yet.

There was a soft sound from somewhere to my left.  I froze, unconsciously holding my breath, straining to identify it and where it was coming from.  For a brief moment, I thought perhaps it was James, returning from wherever I’d thrown him for revenge.  But the noise wasn’t footsteps.  It was something else.

And it was spreading.

The one point of sound had become multiple points.  Like a whisper.  It was growing ever closer and then it moved past me, filling the basement with soft, rustling sound.

Like rain.  It sounded like rain.

Then water splashed onto my face.

It was rain.

It was raining in the power plant basement.

“No no no no,” I whispered to myself, hastily stirring into motion once more.

I had to get out of here.  Was this like the library now?  Was the traveling river coming?  But what frightened me the most was the thought of that black pool of water filling up and spilling over.  Of the water, the surface glossy like oil, spreading out across the floor, reaching out tendrils like fingers to grasp at my heels.

I quickened my pace.  The danger of tripping was now outweighed by the danger of staying here for too long.  My haste was rewarded.  Up ahead I could see another red exit light, glowing luridly like an eye in the darkness.  I was so relieved to see it that I almost wept.

The rain was intensifying.  It splattered in my hair and ran down my neck to soak into the collar of my shirt.  

Something brushed my arm.  I shrieked and slammed against the wall, trying to get away from whatever it was.  I stood there, my breath coming in sharp gasps, staring out into absolute darkness.

I wasn’t alone in the water.

I couldn’t stay here.  I had to keep going.  Whatever was out there knew I was here and there was nowhere I could hide.  The only way out was escape.  I drilled this into my head, over and over for precious seconds, until I could unlock my legs and start my torturous progress forwards again.

It came after me from behind and below.  I felt the impact against my knees, pliant, like being struck with a pillow.  It jerked my legs out from underneath me and I landed bodily on top of it, there was a feeling of weightlessness, of floating, and then I was rolling off and landing on the cement floor.

My legs stung with pain, like the sting of a wasp, where the creature had hit me.

What creature on campus felt like that, I thought frantically.  Like jello.  Was this something new?

I lay on my stomach on the floor, afraid to move until I knew if it was coming back, until I knew what it was.  The rain continued to fall from the ceiling, cooling the sting on the back of my legs.

The rain.  Of course.

The swimmers.  The roots hadn’t trapped all of them in the pool.  There were still some left.

I’m starting to really hate those things.

If it was hunting, it wasn’t committed yet to the kill.  It reminded me of a lone predator, testing to make sure its prey really is prey and it’s not about to make a terrible mistake that could get it killed or wounded.  It might be hunting alone, just me and it, here in this basement.  I sucked in air between my teeth.  I’d killed the eye.  I’d killed the flickering man.  And this isn’t what I want to be, it’s not something I want to do, but I will if I have to.

If it was checking to see if I was easy prey, then I was going to prove I wasn’t.  I’d already learned how, in my first year, when I watched campus security splatter one across the windows.

I shoved myself to my feet and then I put my back against the wall.  I crouched slightly, bracing myself for an upwards spring.  I wasn’t strong, so I’d have to use my whole body for this, starting with my legs.  With all the walking I’ve done for the past few years, surely I had strong legs, right?

Then I waited.  I listened.  And the swimmer made a second pass, just as I thought it would, slapped wetly against my arm but unable to do more than a glancing blow because of how close I was to the wall.  I felt its passage, felt what direction it was retreating in.

And I launched myself off the wall, shoving off with all my strength, and I hit the swimmer fist-first.

It was like a water balloon exploding.  Bits of gelatin splattered against my face and it stung, like being stung by thorns.  I hadn’t planned on what to do after punching it, so I staggered and failed to catch my balance and fell face first on the ground.  I could feel bits of it sliding down my cheeks and I spat and gagged, shaking my head in an attempt to dislodge the viscera.  I raised my face to the ceiling, letting the rain run down my cheeks and over my arms, washing away the gore and feeling it soothe the burning in my skin.

I look like I’ve been sunburned.  It’s honestly not that bad, though.  The welts are almost gone now, as of the time of writing this post.

Then I crawled until I found the wall and following it, limping from the sting along the back of my knees, I found the other door.  The one leading to the outside.  And as I expected, it wasn’t locked.

It wasn’t raining outside.  So I had to walk back to the apartment, soaking wet, my face red and puffy with swelling.  I’m sure I about gave poor Cassie a heart attack when I burst into the living room.

“We need to check the cameras,” I declared.  “Right now.”

Cassie called Maria.  I changed into dry clothing while she did that.  Then we met her at the power plant.  I explained a little bit of the situation as we stood a discreet distance away, making sure the coast was clear before the two of them snuck inside.  I told them that I’d found myself in the basement with no memory of how I’d gotten there or what I was doing.  I warned them about the darkness, the rain, and the swimmers.  They agreed that they’d abort the excursion if anything looked amiss and we’d try again some other day.

Fortunately, we didn’t have to go all the way into the basement to retrieve the camera footage.  Just inside the doorway.

We’d tested this a few times before sneaking them into the basement.  Since we couldn’t hook them up to the university’s wifi (also the wifi doesn’t reach into the power plant basement), we had instead opted for a beefy micro SD and was writing any activity to memory.  Once a week, two of us would sneak into the basement, bluetooth connect to the camera from the door and download/clear anything captured.  The third person would keep watch.  So far we hadn’t gotten any results.  So far we hadn’t captured anything, which is actually pretty reassuring in itself.

This time, however.

This time.

We watched it back at the apartment, on Cassie’s laptop.  I stared in breathless disbelief.

“Ashley,” Cassie said as soon as the scene was done.  “Please don’t panic.  We’ll figure this out.  I promise.”

She couldn’t disguise the desperation in her voice.  Not this time.  She could be hurt, she could grieve, she could be angry, but rarely was she at a loss of what to do.  If she didn’t have the answers, then she at least had the confidence that she’d find them.  But our problems have been piling up and it felt like with this last discovery, the mountain was now insurmountable and we were left clinging for purchase, about to be blown away at the slightest breeze.

For on the computer screen, we’d watched as I walked up to the black pool of water, knelt, [and](https://alderrayne.com/) [drank.](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
