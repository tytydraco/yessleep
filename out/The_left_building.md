I still remember it vividly. I was in my hometown, a small place where nothing exciting ever happened. People were simple, but tough.
There was a sense of community. Everyone knew everyone. Some were kind, many weren’t. In serious situations, they had your back. Otherwise, there was always a tension in the air, too thick to name.

Sometimes there were rumors: a weird family, haunted woods where people were said to hang themselves, buildings you weren’t supposed to live in.
Not gonna lie, I knew those were just stories meant to scare kids. But for a moment, they made life more exciting.

Back then, it felt like that little town was the entire world. People around me weren’t interested in the bigger picture, no big questions, no big dreams. Maybe that’s why I always felt like an alien.
Life was small. Just what lay in front of you.
I was around twelve or thirteen, living in a decaying communist-era neighborhood. Near where I lived stood a tall building.
I didn’t know why the energy around it always felt off until I heard the stories.

It had been built long ago, on swampy ground, with serious infrastructure problems.
It wasn’t even straight. Or maybe it had been, once. Over time, it tilted slightly to the left, and everyone in town knew it.
Few people still live there. Definitely not on the top two floors. Twelve apartments stood empty.
I always asked: “Why? Why does no one live there?”
When I looked up, I saw blackened marks, traces of fire, like the building was crying. 

The story was that many had died. Children, too.
As kids, we hung around that building a lot. My first kiss happened in it with a boy I liked at the time.
Wherever he is now, I’m sure he grew up to be a player. The signs were there from beginning.
But this isn’t a love story.

No, this is about that building, and what lives in it.

We would wander its empty corridors, thirteen floors of peeling paint and darkened hallways. Every time I stepped inside, an unexplained fear crept over me. A stillness that made me freeze.
I brushed it off. My friends felt it too.
The elevator was a gamble. Sometimes it worked; many times it didn’t. And when it did, you risked getting stuck for hours. It was a compromise you had to make if you were too tired to use the stairs.
We played hide-and-seek . The top floors were forbidden, but somehow the forbidden always pulled me in.

We’d start around eight or nine in the evening. One kid would stay on the first floor—the Source—counting for three minutes while the rest of us ran and hid.
I was always good at hiding. Usually among the last to be found.
I remember the giggles and screams echoing through the halls as the seeker hunted us down, the frantic rush to make it back to the Source.

But one night, something pulled me higher than I’d ever gone. I passed the seventh floor, where I found a friend hiding behind old furniture.
“Too obvious,” I laughed—and kept climbing.

I reached the thirteenth floor.
It was apocalyptic. Broken doors. Thick layers of dust. Walls streaked with gray and black ash. Mold creeping in strange, whirlpool patterns. Heavy furniture scattered like forgotten ruins.

I sat for a moment and finally understood what had happened here.
I felt it in my bones, the despair of the souls who once inhabited the place.
A quiet rage and helplessness settled in my chest. For the first time, I truly understood what it meant to die with no escape.

I whispered, “Sorry,” over and over. Tears ran down my cheeks as I prayed for them, though I had never been one to pray.
And then I felt it: two hands on my shoulders, grabbing me from behind.
I jumped, thinking I’d been found,but when I turned around, there was no one.

Everything went hazy. Like a bad dream you can’t wake up from.
My legs weakened. My heart pounded in my ears. My breath came short.
I tried to scream, but only a dry whisper came out.
Then I heard it, a dark, steady male voice:

“Forward. Forward.”

I felt an unnatural force push me toward the balcony.
The railing was gone. Only concrete remained between me and the fall .
I realized quickly, it wanted me to jump.
I whispered, trembling, 

“Backwards... backwards…”

“Forward. Forward”. The entity repeated.

Suddenly, a massive cabinet beside me tilted, then crashed to the floor, blocking the path forward to the balcony.
In the rising dust, I saw faint, clean traces of tiny children’s palms.
I finally could scream a deep, raw, uncontrollable sound from somewhere inside me, and ran, taking the stairs four, five at a time, not daring to look back.

When I reached the ground floor, my friends stared in shock.
I cried silently. I didn’t tell them what happened.
I was already seen as an oddball, and now more than ever, I felt it.
I never returned to that building.
I never spoke about that night.
But even now, over a decade later, I still dream of it.
Nothing scary happens in the dreams. I’m just near it. Living my life. Doing normal things.

I still don’t know what happened that night.
And I’m not sure I want to.
But sometimes, when I’m brushing my teeth…
I look in the mirror, 
and the background behind me tilts slightly… to the left.
