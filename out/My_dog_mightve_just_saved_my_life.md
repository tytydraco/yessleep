For context, I live in suburban downtown Orlando. You can easily figure that out by my comment history. No kids, two pets, and few stray animals (squirrels, opossums, cats, etc), but nothing to be afraid of. Until about a week ago.

The property next door is under renovation, and literally the day they began deconstruction, my wife, my cat (Ballicker), my dog (Hammock), and I all felt a weird 'disturbance'. I'll go into detail at the end, but suffice to say it's unnatural and **intentionally** keeping us awake.

Wife and I have opposite schedules, and *'it'* (as I'll refer to *it* going forward,  because that's as vague a word I can find) knows when one comes and one goes. It makes its presence known as soon as one of us leaves the house or falls asleep. My schedule is less predictable, so I get the brunt of it.

We'll get knocks on the door or a random series of calls/texts from an unknown number, at uncanny similar times, then at random ones that make no sense. Answering has proven a waste of time, as it always gives us a dial tone. In 2025. A dial tone. I digress.

Hard to chalk it all up to coincidence. My wife was recently sent an image, as she was falling asleep, of what appeared to be a spider's nest opening.
Her ultimate fear. 

That was ~30mins after I left for work yesterday. That night, while she was at work and I drifted off on the couch, I recieved a 'video' of the OceanGate sub imploding, (despite video of it does not exist) about 5-10 mins after my wife left for work this morning. That one left me jarred. Somebody/thing knows our deepest fears and is using them against us.

I don't think it is human. My dog loves everyone and everything, to a fault sometimes. He **does not** like whatever is coming from next door and knocking on ours.

It is so random and sporadic, but the voice is always the same. Weird, almost 'dial-up' sounding). Two knocks at the door. *Rap rap*, then humming a tune I don't recognize (I'll try to get audio next time).

One quick "ANY ONE IN THERE AWAKE AND ALIVE?" was enough to tetrify me, in that strange, artificial sounding voice. We're all huddled in the only room that does not have windows, my dog's paw in one of mine, and a Moss 590 (slug, mind you) in the other, clinching both and keeping eyes on Hammock. He's been quiet, but whatever is outside knows that he exists, *by name*, and he's aware of its presence as well.

The hair on his back is as raised as I've ever seen, and I know the size of his teeth (40lb hound mix) but I've never once seen him use them the way he was.

We heard glass shattering in the bathroom, and then the back bedroom. Following that was a strange groaning noise (not the same you or I would make after climbing through broken glass, (again, that weird dial-up tone) and then a gentle knock at the bedroom door. "Hello? Here to help."

"Nope." I said silently to myself with conviction and calming affirmation. We'll just sit here quietly. Cat agrees. Dog has other plans.

He burst the door open, and and all I saw was one spurt of blood before I passed out. The noise alone was too much to bear. The rest is second-hand, as I was told:

*There is no evidence that anyone broke into my house.*

*I have a terrible gash on my forearm.*

*There was a kitchen knife and an old telephone (unplugged) in the closet with us, and apparently I forgot to load the shotgun.*

*Wife thinks I'm crazy.*

*Awaiting DNA tests, but two detectives think the blood is mine.*

Hammock disappeared for a few hours and came back with a severed human hand in his mouth (y'know, as one does) and the fingerprint on it matches someone I know personally. This someone is, and has been very jealous of my wife and I's relationship from the beginning. I can wrap my head around some of it, but there are details I just can't put together to make any sense.

Both pets are okay. Wife and I, who have a better 'understanding' of what is 'going on' and are scared for our lives. She still doesn't believe all of the details of what I just went through.

-Just heard a pounding at the front door as I was finishing this. Will report back. Already bought plane tickets for tomorrow morning, and have somewhere else to stay tonight if I have to.
