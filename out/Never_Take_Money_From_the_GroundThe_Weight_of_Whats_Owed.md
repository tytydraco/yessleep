It’s said that money carries history. Blood, sweat, and tears. Dreams whispered into its fibers, wishes aching to be fulfilled.

They never said money could carry guilt.

The man learned this on the night his punishment came due.

He had done something unforgivable. It was deliberate and intentional, born from the sickness in his heart, a wicked rot he had mistaken for desire. He believed he had escaped it, that what was done in the dark would stay buried there. But evil does not remain contained. It looks for a body. It looks for breath.

The sickness came soon after.

It began where it always had, in his heart, but this time it did not stay hidden. It manifested. Fever bloomed beneath his skin. His throat burned. His lungs tightened until every breath felt shallow and strained, as if something foreign had taken residence inside him. He coughed until his chest ached, until the air itself felt hostile, contaminated.

It did not stop at the body.

Objects slipped from his hands. Doors jammed without reason. Lights flickered when he entered rooms. Strangers recoiled without knowing why. Shadows in his home lingered too long, thickening in corners where they should not exist. At night the weight returned, heavy and solid on his chest, pressing and squeezing, reclaiming what he had taken first.

It felt as though the sickness was spreading outward, seeping into his life the same way it had seeped into his blood.

So he sought help the way desperate people always do, quietly, in places not easily seen or named.

That was where he learned the rule.

A curse, once earned, does not simply disappear. Removing one is heavy work and costly work, requiring sacrifice, debt, and a reckoning most people cannot survive.

Dividing it, however, is free, if you know how.

Paper absorbs. Coins remember.

Paper holds oils, breath, and fingerprints, germs passed hand to hand. Coins have moved through empires, temples, and markets older than memory, through Egyptian stone and Moroccan stalls, carrying the residue of every life they have touched.

Every bill he handled drank a little of it in. The fevered dread, the rot, the watching presence that sat heavy in his lungs at night. Every coin rang softly as he completed the ritual, not like a warning, but like approval.

If someone picked it up freely, found money, lucky money, then they accepted it of their own will.

So he left it everywhere. A dollar on a bus seat. Loose change by a register. A five-dollar bill on the laundromat floor, an offering waiting to be claimed.

Each time someone bent to collect it, the pressure eased. His cough softened. His breathing deepened. The shadows pulled back.

And somewhere else, someone went home uneasy. A little feverish. Irritable. Unlucky. Watched, for no clear reason at all.

He told himself it was fair. He told himself they chose to take it.

What he did not know, what no one warned him, was that curses do not like being scattered.

They travel. They connect. They remember the body they came from. One day, every bill came back to him.

Not in his wallet, but in his house. In his lungs. In his dreams. In the pockets of people who knew exactly where to find him.

Money always circulates.

And so does what is owed.
