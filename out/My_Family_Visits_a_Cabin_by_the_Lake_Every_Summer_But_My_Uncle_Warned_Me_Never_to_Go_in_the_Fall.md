———

I barely slept in the motel.

Calling it sleep at all feels wrong. It was more like falling in and out of shallow black water, every dream carrying that same dragging sound from under the cabin floor. Every time I jolted awake, my first instinct was to check the door, the windows, the corners.

The room never felt warm. Not once.

When I finally sat up for good—around 6 a.m., though the digital clock kept flickering like it was losing power—the cold was still in my bones. Not the kind of cold from bad insulation or autumn air. This was the lake’s cold. That deep bite that feels like it comes from below you.

And when I stood up, I noticed something I didn’t remember from the night before.

There were granules of lake mud on the motel carpet.

Small, dark flecks, smeared near the foot of the bed. I stared at them for a long time, trying to convince myself I’d tracked them in without noticing. But I had kicked my shoes off at the door, and they were bone-dry. No mud on the soles. Nothing on the doormat.

When I grabbed my uncle’s journal from the nightstand, my stomach twisted.

It was damp.

Not wet enough to drip.

Just… cool. And soft around the edges. Like it had been sitting in humidity. Or held by someone with wet hands.

I didn’t want to think about either possibility.
I went to the bathroom, splashed my face, and tried to tell myself the night before was a shock reaction, panic, adrenaline mixing with childhood memories of the lake. My mind kept forming rational explanations out of habit.

But then I tried to call my parents.

Straight to voicemail.

Not ringing first. Not a weak signal. Straight to that blunt automated message.

Something about it felt wrong, like the phone wasn’t off—it was unreachable.

My uncle’s number did the same.

By the third attempt, I stopped trying, because the motel room felt smaller every time the call failed.
I decided to get moving. My plan was simple: drive home, tell someone—maybe a park service officer—what I saw, and let professionals handle the rest.
The parking lot was empty when I stepped outside. My car sat alone beneath a buzzing streetlamp, early sunshine barely cutting through the haze. 

Every step felt heavier the closer I got to the driver’s side door.

When I opened the car, the first thing I noticed was the smell.

Not rot. Not mold.

Lake water. Cold and metallic.

I sat there for several minutes, keys in hand, waiting for the fear to settle.

It didn’t.

But I drove anyway, because the last thing I wanted was to stay still long enough for anything from the cabin to catch up.

I told myself I was leaving for good.

I meant it.

But something pulled me back.

The farther I got from the lake, the more guilt gnawed at me.

I left my uncle.

I watched him disappear toward the trees and then nothing.

I ran until the woods blurred together and didn’t stop until I reached the parking lot, lungs screaming, legs numb. I didn’t even try to look for him once I reached the road.

I told myself it was survival.

But every mile between me and the lake made the truth feel uglier.

The creature could have chased me.

It didn’t.

Which means something stopped it.

Or someone.

I pulled into a rest stop and opened the journal again, willing it to give me something rational, something that made leaving him behind acceptable.

Instead, I found the page with the circled coordinates. A rough sketch of the lake, wobbly lines marking the shoreline. A spot on the northern inlet circled so many times the ink bled through the paper.

Below it, written in ink darker than the rest:
“It rises here first.”

I stared at the words until my chest hurt.

I tried to imagine leaving. Driving home. Pretending none of this mattered.

But the image that kept returning was my uncle’s hand gripping my arm, ice-cold and trembling.

I couldn’t leave without knowing what happened to him.

So I turned the car around.

Back to the lake. In daylight this time.

It didn’t help.

If anything, the sunlight made everything worse.
Daylight removes excuses.

You can’t blame fear on shadows or tricks of the night.

But the woods were utterly still.

No movement.

No birds.

Not even the hum of insects.

The cabin looked… empty. In a hollow, staged way. 

Like the set of a play after everyone has gone home. But I knew something had moved through since I fled.

There were damp prints leading from the treeline toward the porch. Not footprints—more like smears. As if something wet had dragged itself along the ground.

The porch boards were warped, buckled slightly outward. The front door hung partially open.

Inside, the ash markings on the floor—the ones my uncle said kept it out—were smudged in several places. Not blurred by feet. Disturbed. Distorted. Like something uncertain of its shape had pressed against them.

The air in the cabin was cold enough that my breath fogged.

I didn’t stay long.

The trees behind the cabin told me one thing:
my uncle didn’t get far.

It didn’t take long to find signs of him.

A torn scrap of his jacket snagged on a bramble.
Heavy drag marks carving shallow lines through the moss.

And a deep depression in the ground, like someone had knelt there—or been forced down.

No blood.

That somehow made it worse.

On the next page of the journal, written almost frantically:

“It doesn’t always kill. Sometimes it keeps.”

My hands shook too badly to close the book properly.

I followed the shoreline using his sketches. All roads led to the same spot.

The circled inlet was a narrow pocket of water where the lakebed dropped sharply.

The water was unnatural for mid-day—too still, too dark.

On the bank, I found a rope tied around a pine, the end frayed violently. Something had pulled it apart.

And in the mud, half-faded in the sun:

Wet prints.

Not shaped like feet. Not paws.

They looked… improvised. Like something changing shape, adjusting to land, relearning how to move.
I wanted to run again.

But something under a cluster of rocks caught my eye—a bundle wrapped in waterproof plastic.
Inside were sketches. Pages and pages of my uncle’s drawings.

Anatomy of the creature.

Studies of its limbs.

———

“The body is mostly fish—slick hide, no scales, skin that looks boiled and then re-hardened. But the legs… the legs don’t belong to anything that swims. Jointed like a deer’s but wrong in the angles, like something imitating a deer after only hearing it described once.”

“Teeth like a piranha’s, but too many rows. When it closes its mouth the jaw doesn’t hinge the way a jaw should. It slides. Looks like it’s for stripping, not chewing. Strange.”

“It shouldn’t be able to climb with those legs, but it somehow makes it work. The sound is the worst part—hooves on wet rock, like something trotting up from the bottom.”

“The eyes never shine. Light hits them and disappears. Blacker than the lake.”

Notes on how it emerges from the water. One sequence was labeled:

“When it leaves the water.”

The shapes didn’t match what I’d seen exactly.
Some of the drawings looked like earlier versions.

Like it grows.

Adapts.

Learns.

Then I heard it. A voice drifted across the water.

Soft. Calm.

Calling my name.

It sounded like my uncle, but the cadence was wrong.

Not panicked. Not strained.

Conversational.

The echo didn’t match the distance.

And after a few seconds, the voice repeated the exact same phrase, with the exact same timing:

“Come down to the dock. I need to tell you what’s going on.”

My stomach dropped.

My uncle never let me go past the first planks of the dock.

And he sure as hell wouldn’t use that voice.

I didn’t answer.

I didn’t move.

The voice tried again, same words, same tone.
I could practically feel the water waiting.

I made my choice.

I wouldn’t go to the dock.

I wouldn’t go near the water.

If my uncle escaped, he’d have gone uphill. Away from the shoreline. Away from the lake’s pull.
I started backing toward the ridge when something broke the water’s surface.

Not the creature.

An object.

A flashlight—my uncle’s—still flickering underwater, like someone had turned it on recently and placed it gently beneath the surface.

Waiting to be seen.

I felt something watching me. Close.

I stepped back too quickly, and the journal slipped from my hand, falling open on the damp ground.
It didn’t fall to the last page.

It fell to a page I swear I hadn’t read.

The handwriting wasn’t my uncle’s.

The ink was darker. Fresher. Wetter.

It said:

“I told you not to come in the fall. It’s awake now, and it remembers you.”
