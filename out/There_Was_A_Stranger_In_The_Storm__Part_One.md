The lovely state of Michigan has a weather pattern that is a complete mystery to its residents. This is typically contributed to the interference of the great lakes by which we are practically surrounded. 

Recently there has been a storm with a nearly catastrophic impact on my particular area of residence. I used to live in a small home in a subdivision right outside of a small town in Michigan. It was me, my little brother Jack, my older sister Megan, my parents, and my grandfather. 

I know this is cliché to say, but the day began like any other. It was fairly bright outside and I sat in the front yard fixing up my bike. Jack rolled down the short, dirt driveway on his mini dirt bike. My mom called it a ‘crotch rocket’. 

He put his helmet on and yelled to me, “I'm going to try and do that thing where people turn and slide sideways.”

I looked up at him, “That doesn't seem like a great idea.”

He shrugged, “I'm gonna do it.”

I sighed, “Shouldn't you be wearing elbow and knee pads?”

He responded, “What?”

I repeated myself, “If you're doing that, you should have elbow and knee pads.”

He hit the visor down, “Ridiculous.” 

He sped out of the driveway and into the street. He wobbled and tipped over immediately. He corrected himself and kept going. His attempt failed, but I had already moved on. My mom stuck her head out the door and called us inside for dinner. 

We all sat around the table and began to eat the hamburgers. It was mostly quiet except for the loud sound of my grandpa sipping his beer. He was very loud when he drank, and the alcohol would leak out the corners of his mouth and drop into his beard. 

He wasn't living with us because he needed to be cared for, but rather because he could no longer afford to live alone. It was not a situation that I loved as he was constantly drinking and never left the house, which meant I was never alone. 

He slammed the can on the table and announced, “Looks like a storm is brewing.”

“What?” I asked, turning my head to the sliding glass door behind me. He was right. The sky was dark gray, casting a gloomy shadow over the previously vibrant setting. 

My dad nodded, “My phone says that it's going to get pretty bad tonight. We're probably going to lose power.”

Jack looked up at him fearfully. My mom put her hand on his shoulder and comforted him, “We have enough flashlights and lanterns. We will be fine.”

Megan snickered at Jack's discomfort with the idea of a power outage even though she was famously afraid of the dark until last year. 

My grandpa looked towards Jack and grunted, “You aren't still afraid of the darkness, are you?”

Jack shrugged and my mom responded, “It's not just the darkness, there is a really bad storm coming and it is perfectly reasonable to be frightened.”

Grandpa chuckled, “When I was ten, me and my friends would run out into the storms and act like we were soldiers overseas.”

Megan rolled her eyes. Grandpa saw this and his smile dropped. “None of you get it,” He said. 

We finished up dinner and Jack got out a board game for us to play. Grandpa sat in the living room as the rest of us tried to ignore the thunder outside. About ten minutes into the storm, my dad suddenly remembered that he had forgotten to tie the trampoline to something g so that it wouldn't blow away. 

He put on his boots and jacket and headed out the back door. I was right behind him with the rope in hand. 

The second I stepped through the back door, the wind hit me like a truck. I was being pulled to the side and grabbed onto the door for leverage. I made my way down the two small steps onto the back patio, which was now covered with flying water. The rain moved around the hood of my raincoat and smacked me in the face. 

I followed my father as a million little bullets attempted to smother me. We made it across the yard and to the trampoline, which squealed loudly as my dad grabbed it. He beckoned me forward and I wrapped the rope around the metal rim. He knotted it for me and handed the rope back to me.

I stepped over to the large brick tree next to us and attempted to throw the rope around it. The wind pulled the rope with it and I grabbed after it. I managed to get my hand around the flopping rope and walked around the tree, my body hugging the barn. I made it back to the other side after what felt like three full minutes and handed the end of the rope to my dad, who tied it tightly. 

We trudged back to the house. I closed the door behind me and kicked off my boots. My grandpa was holding a popsicle in his hand and laughed, “Little wet out there, huh?”

My dad smiled, “Just a little.” He then sat back down at the table to resume the game. 

I told them to play without me, as I hadn't even really understood the game in the first place. I sat down on the couch in the living room and grandpa plopped down beside me. 

“You know,” He said, “I was a sailor for a little while back in the day. The storms out there were awful, and the only way I could get through them was with a drink and a popsicle.”

I nodded along as he told a story from a storm on the sea. He was interrupted by a sudden knock at the door. He went quiet, so did the kitchen. It was silent besides the sound of rain and wind chimes being whipped around in the storm. 

I heard my dad stand up in the other room. We walked into the living room and towards the door. I watched as he opened it and talked to the person on the other side.

Grandpa whispered to me, “Who the hell could that be?”

My mom walked up behind my dad and joined the conversation. After a moment, they both stepped to the side and somebody in a yellow raincoat stepped inside. 

They were short, a little less than five and a half feet. They had black mud boots on and large amounts of water fell from their hood as they pulled it back. Black hair fell onto her shoulders and her face was revealed. She was a young woman, appearing to be in her early twenties, with gray eyes and a cautious smile.

She looked around the house. She was an attractive woman, and to be honest I was afraid. She took off her boots and my mom welcomed her. 

He spoke, “I'm so sorry but my car broke down and you guys were the only ones with a light on.”

My mom grabbed her arm, “It's okay, in here is better than out in the storm.”

“Thank you so much,” The woman said to my mother. Her voice was soft and soothing. 

My mom took her coat off her and asked, “What is your name honey?”

“It's Helma,” She said. 

Helma glanced over to the couch and I made eye contact with her for a moment. She quickly moved into the kitchen. Me and my grandfather stood up and followed. 

When we got to the kitchen, Helma was sitting in a chair at the table with a blanket wrapped around her shoulders. My mom kicked us out of the kitchen so that we weren't ‘overwhelming’ her.   

She sat in the kitchen for the next hour or so with my mother. They were talking about various things, none of which I really heard. At some point, I went to my bedroom and began reading a book. I had just put the book down and was about to grab my phone when the light turned off. I could hear Jack yell from upstairs. 

I realized that I had forgotten to grab a flashlight before going downstairs, so I left my room. The house was completely dark besides a small beam of light at the top of the steps. I walked up into the living room, where my dad was holding a flashlight. The light was pointed at my mom, who waved her hand to indicate that it was in her eyes. It shifted towards Helma, but only caught her arm as she stood up and moved to the side. 

Megan tossed me a lantern, but forgot to tell me and it smacked me in the chest. I grabbed it before it could fall to the floor and turned it on. Jack was sitting on the couch next to Grandpa. 

My mom said, “Okay, everybody grab a light. Let's get ready for bed. The sooner we sleep, the sooner we wake up and the storm is over.”

She pushed Megan down the hall towards her bedroom. I looked at Helma, who was standing in the corner of the kitchen, barely illuminated by the light. She lifted one hand to wave to me. I smiled at her. 

An intense wave of thunder washed over the house, making it shake. Jack squealed and my dad grabbed the wall. The thunder was still rattling the windows as my lantern turned off. It finally stopped and I messed with the lantern. It turned back on, and Helma was gone. I looked around the room, but couldn't find her. 

I looked out the window as a flash of lightning illuminated the street. There weren't any cars that didn't belong to my neighbors. I wondered how she could have walked this far in the storm if her car wasn't nearby. But why would she lie about that?

Everybody went to their rooms in an attempt to sleep. I didn't even try to change my clothes because I knew I wouldn't sleep with a stranger in my home. It wasn't long before I had to use the bathroom. I went upstairs, did my thing, and exited into the hallway. This was where I heard it. It was a faint sucking sound. The sound of somebody drinking out of a juice box with no straw.

I followed the sound down the dark hallway to the door to my parent's bedroom. Now that I was thinking about it, I hadn't seen Helma sleeping on the couch when I came up here. The storm was still going strong outside as I placed my hand on the slightly open door. 

Upon stepping into the room, I could immediately tell something was wrong. I couldn't see very far inside, but what I did see was that my mom wasn't on her side of the bed. Something dripped from above onto the carpet at my feet. I looked up. 

Above me was somebody latched onto the ceiling, cradling a limp body. It was like a yellow human hammock holding a corpse. That sickly sucking sound could be heard coming from the bodies. The face of whoever was being held up was visible, and the thing holding them had its mouth firmly latched onto their neck. It was my mom.

I stumbled backwards towards the door. The face of the thing whipped around and stared directly into my eyes. I recognized the eyes and the yellow raincoat, and ran. I could hear shuttling on the ceiling behind me as I sprinted through the hallway. I turned the corner into the kitchen and slipped. My body came crashing down to the floor. I started to get back up, but something cold grasped my ankle and tugged me backwards. 

I flipped onto my back and kicked my legs frantically. Helma's bloody mouth opened, revealing glistening fangs within. I finally found my ability to scream and filled the house with cries for help. Helma tugged on my leg, sending me sliding across the tile into the legs of the table. I grabbed a chair and brought it down on her head as she attempted to climb on top of me. She jumped back, and I pulled my leg from her grasp. 

I got to my feet and ran to the counter, where I pulled a knife from the drawer. Megan and Jack were down the stairs  by now, and grandpa was close behind them. When he saw me holding a knife out towards Helma, he grabbed Jack and Megan and began to walk towards the front door. Helma turned towards them as I pulled open the back door and ran into the yard. The wind knocked me to the ground, but I stumbled to my feet. 

I grasped onto the tree and dared to look back at the house. I saw headlights turn on and knew that grandpa was driving away. I was about to make a run for the front yard when something appeared in the corner of my eye. It was swinging back and forth. It looked up to see a body hung by its feet with a rope. It's blood mixed with the rain spraying down into my face. My father was flopping in the wind, his neck slashed. 

I ran past the tree and kept running. I didn't stop until I ran through the field at the center of the subdivision and reached the other side. I collapsed at the backdoor of a brown house and smashed my hands against it, hoping they would answer.
