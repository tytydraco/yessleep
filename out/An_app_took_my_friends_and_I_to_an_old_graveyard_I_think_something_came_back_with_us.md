Im a girl with a friend group of three boys. They get into stupid shenanigans all the time, but growing up I was always told "boys will be boys" so I never paid any mind to it. I've known two of them since middle school, and the third was my fiance, so more often than not I was with them on these stupid adventures.
We were young, bearly eighteen when we hung out that day. 


"Dude, we should go somewhere tonight. Im bored as hell."

Joseph said with a groan as he flicked out his cigarette. 

"Where would we go? It's like midnight."

Kyle asked, we were hanging out at my house, which was in the most boring city in the state. 

"You feel like driving for a bit? I have this app that takes you to haunted places."

Joseph quoted the phrase "haunted places" with his fingers. Half of these apps were scams anyways, but we were bored and stupid, just wanted to drive. 

"What the hell? Doesn't sound like a bad idea."

My fiance agreed nonchalantly. Every show on the television getting boring and it was the weekend, nobody had anything to do.

We got into Kyle's car, he had the best tires out of the four of ours. He pulled the address onto his GPS, the car filled with the usual banter. It took about an hour until we were out of town and at the location. An old, rundown and possibly abandoned graveyard. I had a bad feeling from the start, but we asked for a haunted place and got one.
Joseph had this app on his phone, it was supposed to transmit radio frequencies into a voice from the deceased. Feeling like it would make the trip even more creepy than it's looks, he pulled it up as we walked down the dirt path that separated rows of tombstones. 

Honestly, it was boring at first until the app made a static sound then played a distorted voice. 

"Over here."

The voice said, it was deep and unclear but we were able to understand it. I heard Kyle mutter "What the fuck?", normally the app made random sounds, if anything at all but it was giving directions. 

"Where?"

Joseph asked to the darkness outside of our cellphone flashlights. It took a few moments of listening to static, until it spoke again. 

"Your right."

With that, we turned to our right, walking in between tombs. 

"Keep going."

It said after we got to the last tombstone before it cut off into a dark forest. Finally, Kyle spoke again, pulling Joseph back by his shoulder while me and my fiance walked closely behind.

"We arnet going in that, are we? It'll end up being some hunting ground and we'll get shot."

Kyle gestured to the forest, personally going there would be the last thing I do but I was along for the ride and didn't want to be left alone anywhere. Before Joseph could speak again, a woman's voice, though bearly understandable spoke through the phone.

"Turn back."

"Yeah, fuck this."

Kyle said as he turned around, my fince and I followed him while Joseph stood at the forest edge for a moment before following us. As we got back on the path, we heard a growl come from the forest. Assuming it was some animal, we kept walking, my finance keeping an eye in the darkness of the trees. 
We kept walking, reading some forgotten tombs, wiping some of the dirt off so at least the names were legible. But everyone was a bit quieter, as if they felt the same sense of impending doom as I was. 

"Get out while you can."

A woman's voice spoke through the app once again, right after that happened it sounded like there was running in the forest and it was approaching us. Rapidly.
We didn't think twice while we ran to the car, the run felt like forever, the slamming doors of the car seeming to echo in the dense atmosphere and without wasting time, Kyle started to speed off.

His car had three rows of seats. The third put up because of a time we hung out with two more of our mutual friends, I had my elbow on the seat behind me as he drove. My finance sitting next to me and Joseph in the passenger seat. We actually felt more at ease after while, until I felt something scratch my forearm as it hung behind the seat. I quickly retracted it.

"Ow! The fuck was that?"

I said as if something in Kyle's trunk scratched me. He always left useless things back there that he never bothered to take out. He looked in the mirror at me, and in the darkness of the third row of seats he seen only two dots floating right next to eachother. Eyes.

"Holy shit! Jay, there's someone back there!"

He swerved a bit as he suddenly yelled, my fiance out of fear and confusion threw his arm back in a punch. There was a smack before the eyes disappeared into thin air.

Its been months since that trip, but all four of us occasionally see those eyes in the darkness. It's never tried to touch us again after it scratched me. We're hanging out at my house as I type this, Kyle just looked up and seen a silhouette in the darkness. It's head was bent since it was so tall it had to duck to the roof, it's limbs skinny and unnaturally long to it's body. 

It's standing right next to the front door, and blocking off the hallway to the back.
