Hello lurkers of the internet! This is a new blog for me so, a bit of an introduction is in order. I don’t want us to be total strangers since you’re reading my online diary… I’m Everly Walker, yes, *that* Everly Walker. But, please, call me Evie, it’s shorter, cuter, and more personable! I’m 27, a cancer, and have degrees in both journalism and broadcasting! Alright, alright, I’ll get onto the reason I’m writing this thing, no need to rush me. 

After taking a few months off, I finally got the oomph to start job hunting and found the perfect little advertisement: radio host/DJ accompanied with housing. It was like a dream come true, if you ignore the fact that it was halfway across the country, but still! So, of course, I applied— I needed a fresh start with everything that happened and was more than happy to get away from New York. It didn’t even take a day for them to get back to me, they were impressed by my resume and experience, I was hired on the spot— They didn’t even require a zoom interview and I guess that should’ve been the first red flag, but I was just so excited. I had a few loose ends I needed to take care of before I made the trek to my new home but within a week or so, I had everything taken care of. If you must know, I opted to drive. Yes, I should’ve flown, but I didn’t have a soul to pick me up, and yes, it took me like 5 days to get here.  

Important things you should know before I continue: the aforementioned housing is an old hybrid lookout station, yes, I was unaware that someone else was living there, and no, I did not realize how far into the backwoods this place really was. 

Even after I reached Montana, it felt like it took an eternity for me to find Brimfield and I stupidly assumed I would be living close to town; I was very wrong. It took me hours to find the damned place and once I got there, it took me even longer to find the lookout station. Thankfully, a friendly old man pointed me in the right direction. The drive to the station itself is roughly an hour out of town. At this point, I was regretting my decision. My poor car was getting jostled all around as I drove up the mountain, but then I finally seen it.  

The lookout station was huge, and I’m not exaggerating. It was tall and wide. I had done some research on it before I moved, the builders had the idea of combining a lookout station with a functioning ranger station. Pause and let that sink in. The front half of the station was all windows, the rest was enclosed from the looks of it, and they somehow had lower level to the main building— I’m serious when I say I was filled with dread of that thing falling. After sitting there for a while and contemplating everything I did to get myself here, I finally turned the car off and unloaded my luggage. Then I stared at my luggage for a bit. Why, you may ask? I guess the small detail that it’s a tower slipped my mind! I had 2 big ass suitcases and a large duffle bag, alongside a few totes that I had to drag up those stairs. I mentally slapped myself before I got started. 

After like, 20 minutes I’m not sure. I had got everything up into the station. Once I had a moment to breathe, that’s when a realization hit me. This place seemed oddly lived in lights were on, some mud tracks at the door, jacket on the hangers, and keys too. That’s when I looked up and there it was, a man. We both stood very, very still, and quiet, finally though, he spoke. 

“Um, are you Everly?”  

Ok, resume silence now.  

“Uh, yeah. Who are you?” 

Resume silence again. 

“Um, I’m Kit Wilson, your, uh, roommate?” 

Cue really loud, oppressive silence. 

“Didn’t they tell you?” 

Obviously not?! I was seriously wondering how someone could be so dense at this point.  

After a heated conversation, well, heated on my end, awkward on his, we finally decoded what had happened: during the hustle and bustle of moving preparation I had missed a particularly important email, an email that told me all about Kit. I really think I was more embarrassed than I was anything once we had sorted it out.  

After some awkward silence, which seemed to be a trend, I guess, Kit showed me around the place. Just as I thought, the front half of the lookout was all windows, the remaining half was enclosed, but the enclosed rooms had a door leading out onto the balcony that surrounded the building. Kit swore that the place was sturdy and well-built, I was still nervous, nonetheless. Honestly, I’m still jealous that he got the upstairs bedroom. His office is downstairs, and the radio equipment is upstairs. I’m starting to question whether or not he has a brain. His dog, Dakota, is sweet enough but hyper. Very hyper, actually.  

— 

My first day there went as well as you’re probably expecting: chaotic, stressful, and terrible. Kit didn’t seem to be wise in the ways of shopping, considering the kitchen was virtually empty. The radio equipment is horrifyingly outdated; it’s usable, yeah, but not ideal. The wifi isn’t the best, but hey! It could always be way worse or even nonexistent so! The lookout tower seems to run pretty cold, which isn’t much of a shocker, if I’m honest. 

I got most of my clothes and belongings unpacked, situated, and then put the sheets on my bed. Of course, I collapsed on it directly afterwards. This is when I decided to check my email. I learned that Kit was hired at the same time as me, by the same people— He’s a private forest ranger, I didn’t even know those existed, and he’s 27. He seems nice enough, just very socially awkward. However, I did learn that he’s pretty handy when it comes to keeping the place warm! 

Oh! I forgot to mention some more stuff about the radio. So aside from the equipment being outdated, the chair is pretty comfy, and I have quite a pleasant view from where I work. I rummaged through some of the drawers. I was curious if the previous host had left anything behind; obviously, my search came up dry. I did find the provided music collection; it wasn’t bad, a lot different from what I’m used to playing. Their collection consisted of 80s music, a whole lot of yacht rock, and a few newer songs that fit the overall vibe. Like I said, completely different from the rock and heavy metal I’m used to playing, but still good music overall. I did find a curious sheet pinned to the wall, it seemed to be rules, a schedule. I’m not sure, honestly. That sheet was left alongside a note from the owner, it said to follow the provided schedule as closely as I can, that the residents were used to the show running on certain times, more or less at least. I had creative freedom with the show part of the station at least. I’m still trying to figure out what I’m gonna do for the show, maybe I’ll ask Kit to be a guest or something.  

Now, don’t get me wrong. This place is nice but it’s uh, how do I put this gently… Spooky? The pipes don’t really scream or wail, but they make a weird sound; it’s like crying or something, it’s unsettling. Maybe this is because I’ve lived in the city for so long, but being surrounded by the woods like this is very scary and isolating, even if I do have a roommate. I don’t know. Something about this place is setting off some sort of alarm in my brain, I’m going to chalk it up to jitters though. Even worse when I learned that Kit had been working the music tracks for at least a week, that’s been the most unnerving part. 

Before I turned in and before I wrote this actually, I switched the night track on just like the schedule said. I find it a bit odd honestly, this station won’t reach very far out of town, it’s too secluded. You would’ve had to wander up a little dirt road to take a shit in order to even hear it, if you didn’t live in town, at least, and I find it hard to believe that many of the residents are up this late. I’m not gonna think too much into it if anything I’ll call the boss and ask. Tomorrow will be my first day on the air in, uh, 2 months? I’m excited to be back. It’s a bit different, of course. Everything’s outdated, the music is old and more mellow, and my name’s got a stain on it. It’ll be okay though, it’s just a radio show, right? 

Anyways, this is Evie from 102.7 The Howler signing off! Have a good night, folks!
