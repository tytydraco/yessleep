I have done some ghost hunting, and still upon occasion like to seek out the paranormal. And boy did I find exactly what I was looking for one night.

There were rumors about a house in a neighboring town that was so scary that nobody ever made it completely through except one person.... and he is now in an insane asylum. Once I found out where the house was, my buddy and I loaded up in a car and took off to go check it out.

We got to the house as it was starting to get dark. The house was a huge two story home. No wonder nobody made it completely through. It would take a couple hours if you wanted to explore and look for anything interesting.

The house was obviously old. It was a light blue, but the paint was chipping off, and it just looked like an abandoned house. A lot of the windows were boarded up. Some windows still had the glass, and some windows were broken. 

We walked up to the porch and found the front door to be unlocked. No surprise because the window closest to the door was broken and it would have been really easy to break in. We opened the door and stepped inside. I was expecting to see a lot of old broken furniture, beer cans, and graffiti all over the place. Surprisingly we found no furniture or garbage. I guess the one advantage of a house being so scary that  you cant make it through without running out is it keeps all the party's out.

The first room we walked into was the living room as is most cases with a house. The room was smaller than I expected with a house so big. There was a fireplace that was in surprisingly good shape. We slowly walked through the room, stopping every couple of steps and listening for anything out of the ordinary.

As we approached the kitchen area we heard a noise in the living room. It sounded like someone starting a fire. We quickly looked back into the room to find a fire in the fireplace. We knew right then and there that this place lived up to the hype.

We considered getting out of there, but we promised ourselves before we arrived that we were going to push forward no matter what happened. So we proceeded into the kitchen.

The kitchen was a very big room compared to the size of the living room, and compared to an average kitchen of an average house. Again, there wasn't any furnishings in the kitchen either. As we walked through the kitchen we made sure to pay close attention to what was going on in the living room. Every few steps we would stop and look back to make sure nothing else was happening. We didn't see or hear anything other than the crackle of the fire in the fireplace. So we proceeded.

As we left the kitchen and entered the hallway we started to hear pounding on the walls coming from both sides of the hallway. We walked single file even though the hallway was wide enough for the both of us. The banging continued and as we reached the end of the hallway we heard a voice. It was very difficult to make out what the voice was saying. We stopped walking so we could concentrate on the voice. The voice was barely louder than a whisper. And as we listened, it would grow louder and then back down to a whisper. Finally we were able to make out what the voice was saying.

The voice was calling out to us by name! It knew our names! And it said in a woman's voice "If you continue you will find more than you seek, if you continue you will find more than you seek" And as it said it the second time we heard a loud crash like a window busting, we heard the voice scream. This scream was like nothing I had ever heard before. It was so piercing that I still wake up at night hearing that scream. We covered our ears and as I turned to look at my friend I watched the wall of the hallway tear with claw marks like a bear or cougar had just taken his claws to the wall. We ran out of the house as fast as we possibly could. 

Years later as I was doing some research for my paranormal podcast Brave the Basement I found out that the house was known for a demonic presence. A priest was killed in that house in the 80's trying to excersise the demon. 

The house was knocked down a few years ago, and I still drive by from time to time. And even though the house is now gone, if you drive by late at night you can still hear the voice saying "If you continue, you will find more than you seek!"
