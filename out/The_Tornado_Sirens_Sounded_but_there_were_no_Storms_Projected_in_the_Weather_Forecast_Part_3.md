I stood slowly and stepped towards the people. A woman approached me as I became visible through the firelight. She looked to be in her early thirties and wore a gray hoodie. Her left arm was a patchwork of carbon fiber plating and exposed wire. The joints hummed lightly as she moved. A small terminal embedded into her upper arm displayed scrolling diagnostics.

“What’s your name?” the woman asked.

That question. I hesitated, scanning the area for a quick way out.

“Okay, he’s good to go,” she said to the roof of the caged garden center.

I peered up and spotted a gruff middle aged man lower his rifle. 

“Deacon,” I said, my eyes darting back and forth.

“My name’s Cassidy, Cassidy Benson.” She said, “Sorry for the scare, can’t be too careful with those smoothskins around. This here is Omen, we’ve got food, water, medical supplies, and a place to sleep. How long are you staying?”

I shifted uneasily, aware now the rooftop gunner had vanished. “I wasn’t planning on staying. I didn’t even know you were here, actually. I came from the south looking to scavenge the Walmart.” After a beat, I added, “Did you say medical supplies?”

“Yeah we have a medic in the back near the mulch and soil section. She's got her tent set up back there, it's the one with the red cross.” Cassidy explained, “You should at least stay the night, the smoothskins get more active at night and the howlers stalk the lighted areas.”

“Smoothskins? Howlers?” I asked, puzzled.

Cassidy tilted her head. “Deacon, right? Have you not been out there? I mean you must’ve had run-ins with em’?” 

“So those things have a name? I guess it's fitting.” I answered

Cassidy looked at me with empathy, “Well either way, you're safe now though, go inside and get some rest.”

“Thank you, ma’am.”

Cassidy blushed, a few years dropping from her appearance, “Oh please, hunny,  you can't be that much younger than me! Go on in.”

I walked past Cassidy, not without catching a glimpse at her arm. It looked very sleek, and advanced. It looked like something straight out of the future.

I entered a ragged cluster of survivors, those poor souls who were chewed up by the end of the world and spit back out into the scorched hellscape that lie in front of us. A large bonfire sat in the middle, and a few people gathered around it, eating soup, bread, or chunks of meat off the ends of their knives. The firelight danced across the cement floor and the metal shelving that still held gardening equipment. Makeshift shacks lined the caged walls and palettes laid upon the cold, dirty floor. It was surreal to see a population of people actually surviving out here. On the wall shared with the main store a door slid open. The man that not a few moments ago held a rifle to my skull stood before me, his gruff demeanor now a faint, lighthearted expression. He was an older man, with long black hair parted down the middle, and a neat beard. He wore a camouflage jacket and cowboy boots with spurs.

“Hey, I’m Elias, sorry for pointin’ that gun atchur dome.” He said with a harsh, thick country accent, “Jus’ doin my job, y’know.”

“All good, I understand.” I surmised.

“Eh, well there’s been an uptick in smoothskin attacks lately, cain’t be too safe.” Elias pronounced clutching his rifle. 

 “Attacks?” fear raced through me like a raging rapid.

“Oh yeah, hordes of em’,” He chuckled, “They seem to be drawn to the light, that's why they're normally more dormant in the day, or at least not as hostile.”

“Why do you keep the bonfire lit during the night if they’re drawn to it?” I asked.

“Well during the day, we’re all gone; scavengin’, lootin’, stealin’. So when we come back we’ve gotta eat.”

“I guess that makes sense,” I looked around again, people weary yet resilient, armed but sharing stories. I was lost in thought until Elias snapped his fingers sharply, pulling me back.

“Oh, sorry… what were you saying?”

He gave me a small, knowing smile, “Get some chow, then a lil’ shud eye, you need to be all rested up in the morin’. We’re going scavenging.” 

I hesitated. “I appreciate that, but I'm headed south. My family’s down there. I just need enough supplies to make the trip.”

“Well, we’ll getchu some supplies to make sure you get there. I promise.” He assured me.

I turned to the bonfire, It burned bright as a result of the excessive amount of lighter fluid used to ignite the flame. I approached a table with utensils and bowls and grabbed them. I ladled a small amount of dark brown stew into my bowl. It was cold and bitter, little to no taste touched my tongue. It was gritty and gross, however, it was the first home cooked meal I've had since the world went to shit, I powered through it. I sat there thinking about my wife, Aubrey. She must be so scared and alone with our baby. I prayed,

“God, if you can still hear me, please cover my Aubrey in a blanket of safety and security. Allow my baby boy to feel safe and live well in his mothers arms. Please protect my family and allow me to get back to them soon. Amen…” 

Once I finally stomached my food down, I made my way to the back of the Home & Garden area. The medical tent was fashioned out of blue tarps and bungee cords. A large red cross made of duct tape marked the entrance. I parted the opening of the tarps and walked in. A woman sat facing the opposite wall writing in a notebook on a white fold out table. She wore a set of OCPs with a tactical vest and combat boots. Her hair, a deep black, laid half-way down her back. A helmet with a pair of fold out goggles sat on the table and her assault rifle was slung to her front. 

“Hello?” I murmured. She jumped and turned around, hand on her rifle, breathing deep.

“Oh my god! You scared the shit out of me!” she exclaimed.

“Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn’t mean to!” I explained, “I was just hoping you’d be able to take a look at my shoulder. It is super singed. I’ve been tending to it but, I'm sure with your supplies I could do better.”

“Of course, come take a seat.” she said. She pulled a chair out for me and I sat down. She took a pulse oximeter out of her pocket and placed it on one of my fingers.

“Okay, I’m gonna put the cuff on your arm, so roll your sleeve up.” she continued, “I’m Jackie, by the way.”

“Nice to meet you.” I said in return. I could see her face now, I could tell there was a tense air about her, a sadness in her eyes. On her chest were two name tapes: “U.S. Army” and “Butler.” She bore the rank of Staff Sergeant.. A medic I assumed. 

“So you’re a medic?” I asked as she pumped the arm cuff.

“Yeah, National Guard. When the bombs fell our company fled underground. A lot of us didn’t make it, but those of us that did went our separate ways.” She continued, “I guess ‘no comrade left behind’ flies out the fuckin’ window when the world ends.”

“I was active duty, stationed in Texas.” I explained.

“Really? Well, I’ll be,” she said with a hint of excitement, “anyway, let’s see that shoulder.”

“Yeah, of course.” I lifted my shirt over my head and laid it on the ground. As I straightened back, Jackie’s face was full of horror.

“Oh my God!” she put her hand to her mouth. and backed up. A few moments passed and, “Nah, I’m just kidding. Ha! You should’ve seen your damn face! Oh god that was good. I really needed that!”

“Oh my god, you're the worst!” I balled up my shirt and threw it at her. “You scared the shit out of me. Don’t do that!”

“Oh goodness, no, no, it's fine, just some ointment and bandages, and you’ll be back in shape in no time.” she resolved. 

“Perfect,” I said. She spread out some ointment on my arm and wrapped my shoulder in thick ace bandages. 

I got out of the chair and put my shirt back on. 

“Well, you know, I’m always here… if you wanna talk or…” She hinted.

“Oh, I'm sorry. I'm married.” I clarified

“Right, no, I… should've asked. Sorry. End of the world ya know.” She said sheepishly. 

“No worries, I understand. And thank you very much for…” I gestured to my shoulder. 

"Yeah, yeah. No problem. Take care" 

I walked out through the makeshift door and searched for a place to lay down for the night. 

I eventually found a dark corner where I could stash my ruck and weapon. I laid down and had my first bit of real, safe sleep. I drifted off and a few minutes later, fell asleep.

I was awoken by Elias early the next morning. I estimated it was about six and I wanted to sleep in, but when have I ever gotten what I wanted? 

“Hey, slick, get up. We’re trying to decide where to go.” Elias grabbed my arm and pulled me to my feet.

“Okay, okay, I’m coming. Anybody got a damn toothbrush? I don’t remember the last time I brushed my teeth.” I pulled the collar of my shirt up and scraped the fronts of my teeth. 

“I’m sure we’ve got some in the supply room, not many people ransacked the personal hygiene section” Elais snickered, “Follow me, there's a bit of a debate going on in the meeting room.”

Elais led me to a back room where a table and some chairs had been set up. Cas sat at the head, Jackie to her right. Elias sat down opposite Jackie and motioned me to sit next to him. As I sat down and looked across the room, I met Jackie's gaze, she quickly looked away towards Cas.

“Look, Cassidy, I’m telling you Alder Creek is the best place to go. I used to work there, when we left, we didn't take any of the surplus supplies, it's all just sitting there waiting for some scavver to take it.”

Cassidy rolled her eyes, she looked at me and began, “Good morning Deacon, as you can tell, we’ve come to an impasse. Jackie wants to take a group of us to Alder Creek Supply Depot, an old national guard installation.” She looked back and forth between Jackie and I, “ However, the nearly twenty miles between us and the depot is riddled with smoothskins.”

Elias chimed in, “Nothin’ we hadn’t done before Cas. I’ve taken these men all the way to the city and back. As long as I’m the one headin’ the mission we'll be fine.”

“Elias I understand your confidence, but I can't spare anymore people for these ridiculous supply runs. We’ve lost too many men and got too few supplies for any of this to even matter.” Cassidy seemed upset by this revelation. I think I even saw a tear well up in her eye. She truly cared about the people of Omen and longed for their safety. I never thought I’d see something so… human in the apocalypse. 

“Wait a minute.” Jackie suddenly perked up as a memory popped into her mind, “I think I have a way to knock both of those problems out.”

“Okay?” Cassidy said.

Jackie continued, “Well, the supply depot has a motor pool full of vehicles. Plus a reservoir full of gasoline, barring any scavengers trying to restart their sports cars, we could get trucks to transport our people around the city. That would all but ensure their safety, plus there are loads of weapons and ammunition we could grab and load into the vehicles. It’d ensure our safety concerns and more than triple our supply.”

“That sounds perfect! I’ve only got a few mags full of ammo, multiple crates would do wonders. Plus the military grade gear would be a huge win for Omen” I stated proudly.

“Now that ain’t half bad, Jackie, I guess you're good for more than just pullin’ splinters outta people's feet. Haha!” Elias chuckled thinking he had just received a standing ovation at a stand-up club. 

Jackie rolled her eyes and chuckled slightly, “Maybe we can get you an actual rifle too.”

“What? My rifle is… its a real… ah what the hell are you playin at girl.” Elias seemed actually offended by this statement. 

“Okay, okay. Calm down, Elias. I want you to rally a group and get them ready for the trek out there. Jackie go in the supply room and stock up on medication. Deacon go with Elais and get ready.” Cassidy pulled Elias aside and whispered something into his ear. 

“Roger ma’am, Deacon lets go” Elias picked up his rifle and slung it onto his back. 

After about thirty minutes, Elias, Jackie, about six others, and I met up in the parking lot.

“Alright people, we’ve got about twenty miles ahead of us. Don't fall back behind the group and keep your heads on a damn swivel. We’re going right into smoothskin territory so it won’t be easy. As long as we watch each other's backs we’ll be fine.” Elias commanded. “Jackie? You had somethin’?”

“Yeah, okay people, we’re doing this in a wedge formation, that's two teams of four people, Alpha team in front and Bravo team in back, Elais will be in the middle and I will lead Alpha. Deacon, you can take charge of Bravo.” Jackie knew her battle drills.

Back in Texas we’d do warrior tasks and battle drills about once a month. We’d learn about formation and squad tactics. I knew how to lead this and I was thankful to Jackie for allowing me to take charge of my own team. The wedge formation was basically a triangle, you’d have the team leader heading the formation. Two to their right and one to their left. The other team would reflect this meaning two to the leader left and one to their right. This was mainly done so there’d be an even number of people patrolling on all sides. 

Elais called Jackie and me over, “I want y'all next to me on this one. Your teams can take care of themselves until any kind of attack actually takes place, then you can fall in on your teams. Oh and deacon, here's a toothbrush and I even managed to fish out a bottle of toothpaste, it's up to you if you wanna waste yur water on it though.”

“Ha, thanks Elias! I appreciate it.” I put the toothbrush and paste in my rucksack and went on to form up.

At around a half past seven, we started our march towards the Alder Creek Supply Depot. We left the safety net of Omen and began a mission that would last 3 days. I’ll document our first day of travel now and post the rest later. A lot happened and I need time to write out days two and three so please be patient with me. Here goes:

After about an hour and a half of silently walking through the windswept, dirty city, I noticed Jackie’s, and my team were getting to the point they needed a break.

“Elias?” I whispered, “I think we should take a little break, everyone seems a little tired.”

“Yeah, probably a good idea. Jackie come here.” Elias shouted.

I hit Elias on the shoulder, “woah I thought we were being quiet, what gives?”

“I never said we had to be quiet y’all just never started talkin’” Elias said in his pompous country accent.

Jacky ran over to us, “What’s up, Elais?”

“Let's stop over by that little park and take a break.” Elias said.

As the sun finally tipped the edge of the skyscrapers we veered off to a pocket-park. Elias planted his gear near a decrepit metal swing and began eating some of his rations. Jackie leaned up against a still standing jungle gym and the other survivors found areas to bed down. Impatiently, I tapped my foot as I sat on a concrete rail near the road. I peered up and down the road, looking at the carnage laid before me. It's been a few weeks already and it still amazes me how… horrible everything looks. Overturned cars, jack-knifed semis in the intersections. A tall building clung to its neighbor by a few steel beams, and… vegetation already grew from the metal bastions of old. 

As I sat there forebodingly thinking about what my family must be doing right then, I heard a noise. I looked up the road towards the north. I scanned the cityscape; a four-way, light-controlled intersection, a semi truck turned over on the passenger side and the back wide open, and finally, about four or five mannequins stood right outside the open back door of the trailer. 

Almost as though they were meticulously placed, the mannequins looked down the road towards our impromptu-encampment. I turned to find Elias, I couldn’t find him in the split second I turned around. However, when I turned back to the mannequins, they were ever so slightly closer. I stepped backwards and lifted my hand towards where I imagined Elias to be. After about five seconds, my hand hit someone’s face.

“Hey Dickhead!” Elias said gruffly, “What’re you doing?”

“There. Out there, in the intersection” I managed

“Oh God, that freaky as hell.” Elias stood up and moved over to Jackie, “Jack get up, we got some freaky twilight shit goin’ on here.”

“What is it? Holy shit!” Jackie jumped up and called her team over.

“Guys, we’ve got a situation, form up.” I said to my team of three.

We all formed and began our descent. As we got closer, alpha team got in a line and walked towards the semi, bravo got in a line and watched the formation’s six. Jackie, Elias, and I walked up with an alpha. I was the first to reach the mannequins, I looked intently yet they seemed completely normal. I saw the seam lines between the arms and torso, the fingers were completely sealed together, and a base at the bottom likely held them up. But they definitely moved, I saw it with my own eyes.

Elias caught up to me, “They’ve been getting better at hiding. I heard one mimic one of our own peoples' voices. That guy had died to one of them not but a day earlier.”

Jackie looked one in the eye, “They just look like mannequins. Y’all are paranoid.”

“Jackie, I saw them move… I swear. Oh, fuck! Look!” I pointed to the inside of the tractor trailer. 

While a handful of the mannequins had made their way outside the truck, about a hundred more sat lifeless inside. They were all turned over and lying on their sides, fronts, or backs. None of them stood tall on their base but the few outside. 

“See? Just a load of mannequins. Probably headed to Fallon’s, just down the road,” Jackie surmised 

“I guess, Bravo lets go, Alpha form up… we’re leaving” I moved towards Elias, “When we start walking away, look back and see if they move.”

“Heard.” Elias stated.

We formed back up and continued our march north. After a few seconds Elias came up to me and whispered in my ear, 

“We need to run.”

As I looked back I saw a horde of smooth skins running in our direction. I screamed,

“RUN! Hurry we need to lose them!”

After about three and a half grueling hours, we reached our destination, Adler Creek Supply Depot.
