I’ve searched playground games, regional slang, old message boards, archived newspapers, even digitized library microfilm. I’ve asked childhood friends, teachers, my parents. No one remembers it. No one admits it existed.

But I remember.

And lately, I think it remembers me too.

The game didn’t have a name when we first played it. Not a real one. We just called it “the quiet game,” even though it had nothing to do with being quiet.

I grew up in a small town that doesn’t show up on most maps unless you zoom in until the roads blur. The kind of place where kids wandered without supervision, where the woods crept right up to the edge of the playground, and where adults trusted that nothing bad could happen because nothing ever had.

The game appeared in third grade, the way childhood rumors always do—half whispered, half dared.

“Wanna play?” someone asked during recess.

“What is it?”

“You’ll see.”

That was how it always started.

The rules were simple, and they were always explained the same way, word for word, no matter who told them:

You play alone.

You play somewhere familiar.

You don’t tell anyone you’re playing.

When it starts, you finish it.

That last rule was always emphasized. When it starts, you finish it.

I remember feeling a strange heaviness when the rules were explained, like something pressing behind my eyes. I should’ve walked away. We all should have.

But kids don’t listen to instincts. We listen to dares.

My turn came on a cloudy Thursday.

The “playing” part didn’t involve toys or running or hiding. You just had to go somewhere you knew well—your bedroom, your backyard, the school bathroom—and stand still.

Then you counted backward from one hundred.

Not out loud. Never out loud.

When you reached zero, you waited.

That was it.

No prize. No winner. No explanation.

I chose my bedroom, because it felt safest. I remember the smell of dust and old books, the hum of the ceiling fan, the way the light slanted through the curtains. I stood in the middle of the room, counting in my head.

By seventy, my heart was already pounding.

By fifty, the room felt… wrong. Not darker. Not colder. Just wrong, like a familiar word spelled incorrectly.

At twenty, the sound of the fan faded. I could still see it spinning, but I couldn’t hear it anymore.

At ten, I had the overwhelming urge to run.

At zero, something shifted.

I didn’t see anything at first. That was almost worse.

Then I noticed the shadows weren’t lining up properly. The corners of the room seemed deeper than they should be, like the dark had weight. I became acutely aware of the space behind me, of the air pressing against my back.

That’s when I heard breathing.

Not mine.

Slow. Careful. Curious.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to bolt for the door. But the rules echoed in my head, unbidden: When it starts, you finish it.

So I stayed still.

The breathing circled me, never touching, never getting close enough to feel. I could feel its attention like fingers pressing into my thoughts, sorting through memories that weren’t meant to be touched.

Then, very softly, a voice spoke—not into my ears, but directly into my skull.

You’re not the one I want.

The pressure vanished. The shadows snapped back into place. The fan roared back to life like it had never stopped.

The game was over.

I didn’t tell anyone. None of us did.

Over the next few weeks, kids stopped coming to school.

First it was Jacob. Then Emily. Then the twins who lived near the quarry. The adults said families were moving away, that there were illnesses, accidents, misunderstandings.

But we knew.

They had been chosen.

Because that was the secret rule no one said out loud: sometimes, the game didn’t end.

Sometimes, when you reached zero, the voice didn’t say you’re not the one I want.

Sometimes it said, found you.

After that, the kid would come back different for a day or two. Quieter. Distant. Like they were listening to something the rest of us couldn’t hear.

Then they’d disappear.

No bodies. No police reports. Just empty desks and parents who wouldn’t meet your eyes.

The game stopped after that. Not officially. It just… faded. Like a bad dream you pretend you’ve forgotten.

By fourth grade, no one talked about it.

By middle school, I’d convinced myself it wasn’t real.

I’m thirty-two now.

I have a job, an apartment, a routine. I don’t think about my childhood much. I certainly don’t think about the quiet game.

At least, I didn’t.

Two nights ago, during a power outage, I found myself standing in my living room, counting backward from one hundred.

I don’t remember deciding to do it.

I don’t remember starting.

I only remember realizing I was at forty-three, my lips numb, my heart racing.

The room felt wrong.

When I reached zero, the silence was absolute. No city noise. No hum of electronics. Just the sound of breathing behind me.

Slow. Careful. Curious.

The voice was older now. Deeper. Patient.

I told you you weren’t the one.

Cold understanding settled over me.

I wasn’t chosen back then.

I was spared.

The breathing moved closer. I felt it brush against my thoughts, rifling through years of memories, tasting the weight of adulthood.

Then it spoke again.

But you’ll do.

I don’t know how much time I have.

If you’re reading this and you recognize the rules, if something in your head just went quiet, I’m sorry.

I shouldn’t have written this.

Because now the game has started again.

And this time, it doesn’t seem interested in children anymore.
