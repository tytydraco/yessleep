My heart still hasn’t stopped pounding. This is a true story. Last night, I was skiing and camping out of my RV in an unofficial secret spot. High in the Sierra Nevadas of California, the location was right next to one of the most imposing peaks of the area, at the base of which was a frozen lake and a resort closed for the season. Sparse trees surrounded the lake, and a pillowy fog hung over the icy expanse at dawn and dusk. Obscured by banks of snow from the adjacent highway, plow drivers had only bothered to clear a small portion of the road into this resort. It was the perfect place to hide out for a few nights.

As soon as I tucked into bed, I started to hear the strange noises again. This time they wouldn’t stop. From the absolute darkness in the otherwise total silence of a blanket of snow, I heard something moving - not human footsteps. It sounded like two snow shovels piercing the ground. Quietly, but quickly it traveled. Through my open windows, I suddenly felt an intense feeling of being watched. 

The entity came from towards the lake, a path which was covered in three feet of powder. The noises got louder until it was right up to the side of my window. Terrified and afraid to make a sound, I lay in my bed watching and listening. Only a thin bug screen separated me from this creature in the pitch darkness.

On a night with not even a breath of wind to cause the sensation, I felt my RV pitch from side to side. It had climbed to the top. As it clambered about, I heard the now familiar noise of the night’s frozen dew cracking under it’s weight. I could hear the ice fragments shed off the edges of my home and burst upon hitting the ground.

I say familiar because I had heard these noises before. On the first night, ice had also fallen with the sound of footsteps and the shaking of the RV. Thinking it was a person up to no good, I charged outside with a flashlight and a knife. After all, the paranormal usually has a logical explanation. Examining the site carefully, there wasn’t so much as a new print in the snow. Satisfied, and with the noises gone, I slept unperturbed. The second night, my brother slept in the room. I heard the ice crack again, but no more. Neither compared to this third night.

Judging from the amount the RV rocked as the entity moved, it was lightweight and agile. It was clever enough to completely stop moving as a car from the highway approached, long before lights would dimly illuminate the campsite. It watched me even when it stopped. 

It climbed down from the roof. I could hear it’s snow shovel feet crunch into ground as it began to pace around my camper. The creature alternated from roof and sides. I realized it was looking for a way in. Breaking free of my petrification, I gently rolled over in bed and shut the two windows next to my head, covering them with blinds.

It noticed. I immediately heard the shoveling retreat. But it didn’t leave. Straining my ears, I could tell it was pacing about 30 yards away. Even though there was no wind, what sounded like a metal sign clanging against a tree persisted. I tiptoed to my knife and clutched it against me. Eventually I fell into a fitful sleep.

I had a pleasant dream about my grandparents. At the end, it changed. I was on the couch in the camper, and from a roof vent above me a dark ooze draped into my space. Gathering my courage, I unsheathed my knife and thrust at the shape with a shout. To my surprise, I was still in bed, my knife was sheathed, and I had just stabbed a guitar.

Still, it was too topically relevant of a dream. I wanted to stay and sleep, but I wanted to not be cursed by this entity even more. I brandished my knife and headlamp, bursting out of my door. My light whipped wildly about, looking for any evidence of the creature that had visited. Nothing. No footsteps. No roof ice, shattered on the ground. No metal sign attached to any tree for clanging. I jumped into the driver’s seat and got out of there. 

I slept at a nearby populated campsite until dawn. Not a single noise, even with the windows wide open.

What was that thing? What did it want? Surely there must be a physical explanation in this scientific age we live in, but after what I experienced, I’m not so sure.
