Hello everyone,

I live in a small village, deep in the mountains, where myths and legends still linger like the mist that rolls in at dusk. It’s the kind of place where the old stories are told in whispers, and everyone knows that certain things are better left undisturbed. 

Over the years, I’ve heard all kinds of tales—some eerie, some strange—but none have stuck with me quite like one I heard from a neighbor named Doru.

One evening, my parents and I were visiting Doru’s house. It was a small gathering, a few neighbors sitting around the fire, exchanging stories as we often do. That night, though, Doru shared something different. It wasn’t the usual lighthearted tale. His voice had a gravity to it, a seriousness that made the room fall quiet.

He began to tell us about a man who had once lived just a few houses down from him when he was younger. 

This man, Doru said, had been hearing strange things late at night. It started innocently enough—a voice calling his name from outside his window. At first, he thought it was a dream and paid it no mind. But when it happened again the next night, around the same time, he began to worry. The voice was louder, more insistent, and seemed to come from just beyond the fence outside his home.

Frustrated, and half awake, the man finally threw open his window to confront whoever was calling him. “Who’s out there?” he shouted. “What do you want at this hour?”

That’s when he saw it—gleaming eyes, staring at him from the other side of the fence. But these eyes weren’t at the height of a person. They were hovering well above the ground, almost two meters high, just floating there in the dark. The man froze, his breath catching in his throat. He couldn’t see a body, just the eyes, glowing with a strange, unnatural light.

Terrified, he slammed the window shut and turned to wake his wife. But when he opened his mouth to call her name, no sound came out. His voice was gone. He shook her, panicking, but when she woke and asked what was wrong, he couldn’t hear her either. He had lost his hearing, as well.

From that night onward, the man lived in silence, unable to speak or hear. And though he tried to warn others about what he’d seen, most people in the village didn’t believe him. They called it madness, or perhaps just an old man’s fear of the dark.

As Doru finished his story, most of the adults in the room laughed it off, dismissing it as just another superstition. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something more to it. There was a tremor in Doru’s voice, something that didn’t match the amusement of the others. I could tell he wasn’t just telling a story—he believed every word of it.

When we left Doru’s house that night, I felt unsettled. The image of those floating eyes haunted me, and Doru’s anxious glances made it worse. I tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep, the darkness outside my window feeling heavier than usual.

The next morning, before the sun was fully up, I slipped out of bed and dressed quickly. I couldn’t stop thinking about the man from Doru’s story. If he was real, there would be a grave in the village cemetery. If not, maybe it was all just a tale spun to frighten curious children. Either way, I had to know.

I made my way through the misty village, heading toward the old cemetery on the outskirts. The morning fog was thick, clinging to the ground like a blanket. The silence felt eerie, but I was determined to find out the truth. 

I walked between the rows of graves, scanning each headstone, searching for the name or the face of the man from the story. Row after row passed, but I found nothing. Just as I was about to give up, I saw a figure standing among the headstones in the distance.

At first, I thought it was the caretaker, but as I got closer, I realized it was Doru. He was standing in front of a grave, his shoulders slumped, his face pale in the early morning light.

“You couldn’t let it go, could you?” he said, not turning to look at me as I approached.

I hesitated, unsure of how to respond. “What do you mean?” I asked, my voice quiet in the stillness.

Doru sighed deeply and pointed to the grave in front of him. “You’re looking for him, aren’t you? The man from my story.”

I looked down at the headstone. Beneath the photo of an old man was an inscription that sent a shiver through me: _We will never forget you, and we will never let the darkness enter our home._

I glanced back at Doru, my heart pounding. His face was drawn, his eyes hollow.

“The man I told you about,” he said slowly, “was my father.”

A cold chill settled over me as his words sank in.

“I didn’t tell you everything last night,” Doru continued. “I was there, sitting on the porch when it happened. I was just a boy. My mother was inside with my father. It was a foggy night, just like this one. I remember the air growing cold, and then... I saw the eyes. They were hovering outside the fence, just like my father described. I didn’t know what to do, so I ran inside.”

He paused, staring down at the grave. “My father lost his voice and hearing that night, just like I told you. People stopped believing him, saying he had lost his mind. But I saw the eyes too. I’ve never forgotten them.”

I stood there, speechless, my skin prickling with fear.

“And the worst part,” Doru whispered, “is that ever since my father died, I’ve heard it too. Every night, I hear the voice calling my name from the darkness. I never look out the window. I never answer it.”

He looked up at me, his eyes filled with sorrow. “You shouldn’t either.”

I backed away slowly, my heart racing, the weight of Doru’s words pressing down on me. As I turned to leave the cemetery, I couldn’t help but wonder if, one day, that voice would start calling my name too. And if it did, would I be able to resist?
