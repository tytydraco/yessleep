So one day when I was like 6 or 7, I hopped onto my ps3 and inserted my minecraft disk. I love minecraft to oblivion back then and I still like it to this day. my siblings were very young and napping, so I had to be quiet. I loaded into a map that was like a scary amusment park. It was 2 or 3 in the afternoon so I wouldnt get too scared if the audio changed or something. I was a scared 7 year old, I had to sleep with 2 nightlights on, and I wasnt allowed to play this map after 4. But anyways, I loaded in, and in minecraft ps3, you can test play a gamemode for however many hours you want, and build whatever you want, but as soon as you leave it all gets reset. I changed the gamemode to creative because it was hard to play survival in that world. the music was, at times, very unsettling, so i turned audio off. The off part ois important. There was a giant clown roller coaster that looked pretty cool, so I set off to go on that ride. midway through the ride my minecart just stopped. not slowed down, stopped. What scared the actual crap out of me was that the sound was ON even though I set it OFF. Being the stubborn kid I was, I kept playing to try and find a solution. and then, what sealed the deal was some random player, (There was no online play because I was 7 and didnt have psplus) so I thought in my head, "oh poop oh poop a hacker joined my game what do I do." What did I do? turned off the ps3 entirely. I have no clue what the users name was because im 17 and that was 10 years ago. 

The next day I got back on exept in a little big planet world (in preview mode), anyway, I go pee and come back to find a giant wool planet on fire, that I clearly didnt set on fire. I didnt take much notice of it and had a decent time playing the map. After roughly 1-2 hours I started to feel very uneasy, like I was going to puke. So while I was stumbling out of the bonus room to the bathroom I puked up a pure black liquid on the carpet. I dont know what it was but it sure didnt taste like puke in my mouth. After this though everything was normal, until like a year later when my dad bought me a new map. i think it was a faollout map but I'm not 100% sure. my dad was an avid fallout new vegas player so he hooked me up with this minecraft map. as I knew from the game, I neede to build a camp, so I embarked on clearing land for my camp. after I had build the basics, a playercame up to me (once again, nobody could possibly join the game), I tried to leave but it just said: "failed, please try again" it happened over and over until it worked. the next day that I joined the server,everything was gone, the map was a barren wasteland. I left and the ps3 screen turned red, I knew I f'd up somehow so I turned the tv off. a week has gone by and I thought everything should be ok, everything in minecraft was gone. All gone. I told my dad and he couldnt do anything, but he got his refund for the map so he didnt care too much. I just stopped playing minecraft. Its sitting somewhere collecting dust. This was kinda trauma causing to me because it simply scared me. the end.
