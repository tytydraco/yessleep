I don’t want to come off as some kind of jealous ex-boyfriend, but I can’t help but feel like the asshole in the situation.

My afterlife has been nothing short of a tormenting nightmare recently, and I seek your judgment. I am a restless spirit, condemned to an eternity of regret, dwelling in the place between life and death. My story might make you question how far I went for revenge from beyond the grave.

My name is Alex, and I cherished a profound friendship with a man named Scott. We shared everything, from childhood secrets to our shared love for video games and even our romantic interests.

But then, fate intervened, and I encountered the love of my life, Emily, one day at college. Her intelligence, beauty, and infectious humor ignited our connection, and I believed that my quest for everlasting happiness was finally fulfilled. Emily and I embarked on a passionate journey together, weaving a perfect tapestry of love and companionship. We were inseparable, our world a luminous paradise with her presence. However, destiny played a cruel hand, as I a tragic end in a devastating car while I was on my way over to her apartment, leaving Emily heartbroken and bereft.

From the afterlife, I was forced to witness my own funeral, a heartbreaking spectacle as Emily and Scott grappled with their inconsolable grief. I longed to console Emily, to assure her of my undying love, but my presence remained insubstantial, my voice coming out as nothing more than a garble mess.

As the months passed, Emily and Scott's friendship deepened, evolving beyond mere solace in shared grief. Their camaraderie evolved into something more, an emotional connection that transcended the boundaries of friendship.

I was helpless, a captive of my own emotions, as jealousy and anger festered within my spectral essence. I watched in despair as their relationship metamorphosed into a passionate romance. Then one night I followed them to a spot I knew all too well, a field on the outskirts of town where Emily and I would spend hours stargazing. Before I knew it I saw Scott get down on one knee and present her with a ring. It felt as if they were erasing my memory, a treacherous betrayal of the love I had held for Emily, and I could hardly bare it.

In my agony, I adopted a malevolent persona, an unseen force bent on unsettling their lives. I manipulated their world in subtle ways, causing electronic devices to flicker, objects to fall, and spectral whispers to fill their nights. I yearned to make them acknowledge my ceaseless presence, and put a stop to their love.

It was a horrifying, never-ending drama in which I played the role of the vengeful protagonist. Despite recognizing the pettiness and selfishness of my actions, I couldn't restrain the overwhelming love I still held for Emily.

Over time the constant terror I caused them and the relentless pursuit of ruining their path to happiness, began to drive a wedge between them until one night they had a very serious conversation on the couch which ended with them deciding to live separately for a bit to see how they feel. Satisfied with this turn of events I smiled to myself until I saw the look of devastation on their faces. It was the same look they had at my funeral. That was when I realized that I may have gone too far. They were only able to get through their grief because they had each other, and through that shared grief came a beautiful connection. 

They were the most important people in my life, and I should want nothing more than for the two of them to be happy, right?

So, AITA?
