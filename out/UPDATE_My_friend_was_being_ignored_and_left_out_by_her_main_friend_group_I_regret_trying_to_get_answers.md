I was shaking, stressing over the idea the girls might break in at any second. Eventually, the police arrived and told us they'd be on the lookout, which eased most of my nerves. Alice and I still needed to hide, though… and for how long was unknown. A couple of hours after the police left, there was a knock on the front door. A male voice echoed in.


“Hello? We have the property secured. May I come in?”


I went over to the door and answered it, relieved help had returned. The officer stood on my welcome mat, with his radio in hand. I took a deep breath. “Thank you so much for coming. Can you stay for a while?”


“Yes, I will stick around. Because your description of the perpetrators is quite alarming, I've brought backup.”


I sped to Alice’s room, then repeated to her what the officer told me. She sighed in relief, but still had that look of conflict and stress on her face. No matter how much we had discussed her friends, I was still confused as to why they hated her. She has never done anything wrong, as far as I know. This situation was so out of the ordinary. She was always pretty innocent and sweet, so who would act out against her as if she had done something criminal?


The officer was at the kitchen table, speaking into his radio, while Alice and I went over the things she has done that her friends may have mistaken for malice. We couldn't come up with a single thing that would drive anybody to chase after anybody with hammers. Who would be that pressed about someone being unable to hear them? Reading a text wrong? Looking in the wrong place at the wrong time? Eventually, the officer walked over and told us to follow him outside. We put our shoes on, then out we went.


The three of us were mostly silent as we walked along the sidewalk. It was a chill, warm night. So quiet, I could only hear the sounds of our footsteps. At some point, we stepped into a convenience store. The cashier was absent, and there were a few candy wrappers littered across the floor. The officer brought us into one of the isles, then looked us both in the eyes.


“You hear the music playing? That'll be your lesson for tonight.”


It was a rap song about trust. I didn't understand what it had to do with the situation. I didn't understand how what the officer said was supposed to fit in with the atmosphere of this situation. Before I could open my mouth, I heard the front doors. The officer looked over, then stepped away from us. Five girls walked in, all with touque masks and hammers. My heart dropped. The girls stood by each other, left hands resting on their hips as they all stared at Alice and I. Alice gasped. “Oh my god!”


The officer let out a good laugh, right at our faces. I raised my right brow at him. “Why are you laughing right now?”


The girls started giggling, but not in any innocent way. The officer shook his head at us. “You two seriously thought you were safe with me...”


I was confused. Why would a police officer say that? What did he mean? What was he doing? The girl to the far left pointed her hammer at the officer, giggling. “He's my boyfriend!”


The “officer” took his hat off and let it fall to the ground. “I need to get out of these clothes. See you later, Sandra.”


It was like my soul turned to ice. All those feelings of assurance and safety were just… the result of a trick. How'd they even do this? What happened to the police we called??? Our safety wasn't real! I looked at Alice, who’s pupils had shrunk and looked less colorful… like the life was taken from her. “Why…? What are you doing?”


Sandra rolled her eyes. “We got you to come here so we can get you. Did you have fun feeling safe?”


Sandra's boyfriend walked up to the doors, the girls moved out of his way to let him exit. My brows furrowed, I stared at Sarah. “Who's idea was this!? This is cruel and… you shouldn't be doing this stuff!” Sarah, shifting her weight onto her right leg, pointed her hammer at her head. “Mine, actually.”


The girls sprinted towards Alice and I, eyebrows furrowed and hammers pointed at us. I grabbed Alice's shoulder, then turned and sprinted to the back of the store with her. There was a door, but the handle wouldn't budge. My nerves were stinging. Next thing I knew, excruciating pains hit my back and shoulders. The force of multiple hammers brought me to the floor, then one of them struck my right knee. The pain was unbearable. I reached for my knee and let out a scream. Leah grabbed both my hands and held them above my head, then Sarah and Sandra struck both of my knee caps again, making me scream louder than I ever have. They then started scraping my waist with the front of their hammers. Meanwhile, Alice was wailing and screeching. Jessica and Anna weren't holding back, striking every nerve-ending-heavy part of her body once, before scraping her forehead. I could barely do anything other than kick and wail. The only thought on my mind was… “why?” I was then struck in the head, and everything went blurry.


Sometime later, I awoke in an empty room with white brick walls and a metal door with no window. My body was aching from the hits it took, and I was confused as to where I was. Hours went by and nothing happened. All I had were my thoughts. Eventually, I fell asleep, and woke up to a plate with three slices of steak sitting beside me. It was cold, but I was hungry and had nothing else to do.


I'm unsure how much time passed, but I was given some more cold steak meals and my legs were aching less. While the hits from the hammers were painful, I should admit they weren't very strong. I can only guess it was more of an intimidation thing, than it was torture. It was still quite painful though.


Another hour had to have gone by before the door creaked open. It was Sarah, without her mask, face and long blond hair fully visible. She was holding a jar in her hands while staring into my eyes. “I brought this. Have fun with it.”


She pointed the jar at me, then twisted the lid off. Shutting her eyes, she turned the jar upside-down, letting a blurry object fall to the floor. It looked odd. It was as if something was able to be given a censor-blur in real life. As I stared at it, my heart dropped, shivers ran down my spine, and my head began to ache. Sarah backed out of the room, shutting the door on her way out. What made this worse was the click of the door being locked. I jumped up, looking at the blurred object as it sat on the concrete floor. I needed out. I picked myself up, ignoring the aching, and stumbled to, then body-slammed, the door. I twisted the handle, hoping I could somehow rip it out. Of course, it was no use. Fear really does things to your confidence, doesn't it?


I was hyperventilating, but then I wondered, why was I so afraid of this? It was an object… it can't move… I sat down facing the door. I was not going to look at that rancid THING. I hated it so much. It was like its purpose was to heighten my fight-or-flight response. Specifically the flight part. I reached into my pocket for my phone. As I pulled it out, I noticed the screen was terribly scratched and cracked. “LOL” had been written on it with mascara. All I could do was throw it at the object, but I would need to look at the object in order to properly aim for it. I buried my head in my arms, hoping I'd at least fall asleep.


Well, I did fall asleep… but I woke up to a painful prickling on my left shoulder, like hundreds of needles were poking me at a time. I looked and saw, up close, the blurry object. It was just sitting on my shoulder… until it moved. Shocked to my soul, I jumped up and ran my shoulder into the wall. The thing fell off and landed by my foot. I went over to grab my phone, then blindly threw it at the thing while turning my head away. The phone made a thump, rather than a crash, so I had to have hit the thing. While catching my breath, the painful prickling returned near the center of my back. My stomach tightening, I took my shirt off, then slammed it to the ground. Luckily, it was covering the object, but I could see a hump moving around. I became disoriented, throwing up on the ground.


I had felt enough fear for enough time to grow frustrated. In a desperate need to get rid of the thing, I took my right foot and stomped the hump again and again and again. I heard a splatter. Once I could feel I had flattened the thing, I stopped. I bent down and gently lifted my shirt until I started seeing a disgusting mush of black, red, and purple, along with a white slime. As disgusting as it was, my adrenaline wasn't rising. However, my shirt had rips and disgusting stains.


The door clicked, then creaked open. My heart skipped a beat. I stood up, hoping to my life it wasn't one of Alice's twisted friends. It was just Alice. Her face flushed, eyes sunken. Her shirt was torn, exposing her stomach and shoulders. She let out a deep sigh. “What did they do to you?”


I explained everything. She nodded.


“They made me eat one.”


I nearly threw up again. “They made you what!?”


“Yeah… Sarah and Sandra tied me up, then Sarah put a tube in my mouth and… and… I can't even…”


I was desperate to know why Alice's friends were doing this. Going to the greatest lengths possible to torment Alice and I…


“Did they do anything else to you?”


“They sat away from me and talked about all the fun things they've done together, along with all the fun things they plan on doing with each other. I tried to talk to them, but they’d barely respond. Then, apparently, Sarah stole my childhood DVD and brought it with her. She stood up and scratched it against the wall while the others giggled and glanced at me.”


“Well… that's cruel… they're horrible, terrible people!”


“It was worse that they weren't wearing their touque masks anymore. It was like a casual hang out I wasn't invited to.”


“Did they even passively talk about their problem with you?”


“No, but they would occasionally bring up my name, then go “ew” and “gross” or make a disgusted face.”


Alice did not deserve to go through any of this. I wanted to figure out what her fake friends’ problem was, and even if Alice did something wrong… 1. she'd be the one to apologize and do better. I doubt she'd have done it on purpose… 2. her friends are definitely in the wrong for being violent, impersonating authority, and kidnapping. Why can't people just communicate? Or at least say they don't want to communicate… I told Alice we needed to stay far away from her psychotic excuses for friends. She nodded her head in agreement. “Definitely. Although, I think one of them was neutral.”


“Neutral means you don't care about the stuff the toxic one is doing. You don't want to cut them off for being toxic, because you don't see that what they're doing is wrong.”


Alice nodded her head in agreement as a woman with long black hair, who looked to be in her 30s, peered into the room. “Oh my god, are you two alright!? I’m an employee here. I heard there were five girls causing some trouble.”


Alice looked at her. “Yeah! They made me eat a weird bug and socially humiliated me!”


The employee nodded her head. “I see, alright. You two need to come with me.”


We followed the employee into the hallway. I couldn't guess where we were. The hallway was just white bricks and grey metal doors along both walls. It didn't help that I couldn't recall how I got here. Every question Alice and I asked was ignored, which meant I had to wait longer for any answers. It couldn't be that long, though… right?


At the end of the hallway, there was a pair of double doors. The employee held one of them open for us, and when we walked through, a pit formed in my stomach. The five psychopaths were standing by each other in the center of an empty lobby, pointing their phones at us. Sarah rested her left hand on her hip. “Ew, look, it's those sluts!”


Sandra flipped back her long black hair. “They're so gross!”


I looked into the employee's eyes, waiting for her to tell them off. I was hoping she'd curse them out too. She nodded her head left and right. “These two girls were trespassing on this property and brushing up against male employees without consent. Say what you need to.”


And if my trust in authority hadn't already been obliterated… now we were being framed? The psychos put their phones away. I looked at Alice to check for her reaction. Her brows were furrowed.


“I know everything about you, by the way. We've been friends for eight years.”


Jessica chuckled. “Oh yeah? We know everything about you too! We still have that video of you being tricked into keying someone's car by being told it was a junk car you could practice your rage on.” The girls chuckled. Alice had a look of determination. Meanwhile, I was shaking. What's about to happen? Did Alice have to say that at this moment? Sarah looked me in the eyes.


“Alexa, you shouldn't be friends with Alice, if you don't want to be dragged into her problems. You wouldn't be framed as a sex offender if you weren't here.”


I raised my right brow. “But you're the ones causing these problems! You're torturing Alice… and I… and you aren't giving us any reason!” The girls slid their phones into their pockets, then walked over to me. I was cornered. Even if there weren't six women cornering me, the exit doors were boarded up beyond their frames. There was no immediate way out. Sarah was staring me down.


“You know what, Alexa?”


I was sinking, still unable to process any of this very well. “What?”


Sarah and Sandra sped up to me, then grabbed me by the arms. I froze, reminded of what went down in the convenience store. Jessica smirked. “I think we should let Alexa get her words out now.”


Sarah giggled. “I bet she thinks people will believe the bug thing.”


Sandra giggled. “That was the reason we introduced her to the bug, so...”


The employee gave me her phone, then she told me to vocalize every word I type. As I typed this, the girls giggled and rolled their eyes at every moment of fear I recounted. They want me to feel small, but I'm too distrusting of them already. I want this to be settled peacefully and maturely. I don't want to go through anymore torture.
