Tonight, I decide to look. 

I’m gripping the revolver, slicked in sweat, as I crawl to the window. There is someone outside watching me. A body with gangly arms and bloated extremities. A head too big for its shoulders, its face frozen in a contorted grin. It’s saying something, but I can’t make it out. The voice is muffled beneath the thing’s unmoving face. It sounds like a threat. *Come here*, I imagine it saying. *It is your turn to wear the mask.*

But when I gather the courage to peek my head above the windowsill, there’s nothing there. Just my own pale, translucent reflection. Despite this, anxiety remains lodged in my chest. Despite what I can see, what I can hear, a part of me thinks I am being watched. *Knows* I am being watched. Rain patters against the glass. I resign myself to staying awake. There will be no more sleep tonight.

\*\*\*

This happens more nights than I’d care to admit. Those unblinking eyes, those inflated limbs. It watches from beyond the window, or inside the closet, or wherever I decide to lay my head and pray for sleep. No matter where I go, there it is. In the motel room, I hear it giggle behind the shower curtain. In the park, I watch its shadow dance with the moonlight. In the sanctity of my own home, it violates everything I once deemed safe. 

I don’t have the full memory. The images come in patches: my hands gliding along the waiting rail, its textured paint rough against my fingertips. A voice I don’t recognize saying something I can’t remember. Waves of people on their way or coming back. And somewhere along the line, my hand loses contact with my mother’s. I become adrift in the sea of bodies. There’s a shuffle of hands and faces. Amid one of them is the face.

What I can never decipher: why me? Was it opportunity? Or was it something else?

Back then, I didn’t know to fear it. It was simple. Cartoonish. The plush smile of a theme park mascot. The face of the park’s creator blown out of proportion. Stretched smile. Wide eyes. An oversized cowboy hat. Something meant to charm the kids, to summon smiles and laughter. What I didn’t understand was, there was someone inside.

It said, *follow me.* It said, *you can trust me*.

\*\*\*

The hardest part of having a closet near your bed is deciding to leave it open or closed when you sleep. This is necessity. This is a deliberate choice. I struggle with it every night. If I choose to leave it open, I expose myself immediately to those who watch from it. I make myself vulnerable, incapacitated. The moment I close my eyes, they have control. 

But the opposite, closing the door, may be worse. I never know if it’s empty or not. The safety the barrier of the door provides is two-faced. It hides me, but it hides them, too. If I want to know for sure, I have to go to the door and open it. I have to go to the closet door and stop breathing long enough to twist the handle and pull. I have to bring myself to the point of fear. I have to go down into the basement, or investigate the abandoned house, or pull open the curtain, or check under the bed, or peek my head above the windowsill. All the things we know we shouldn’t do. Because of the two, of knowing and not knowing, one is worse.

But there’s a third thing they leave out. The third option. The worst of them all. Knowing, and not seeing. When the conviction overrules the evidence. When the hairs on your neck stand straight up and all the biology formed through time screams-

*There is someone behind you.*

But you look, and no one’s there. You look again. The calm never comes. You look again. The hairs never settle. And it dawns on you, as it has me.

It’s not a question of if. It’s a question of when.

\*\*\*

Some things, the more you try to explain them, the less sense they make. It’s everywhere. How the length of a second is relative. How there are infinite numbers between zero and one. Some things just are, despite explanation. I know how it sounds. I’ll try to keep it simple.

In my memory, there’s a room. It’s full of the same face. Rows of mascot costumes. Lifeless, unmoving. I remember thinking they were all dead. Then I’m in another room, with more people. The mascot who’s been leading me gives me to the other people. Like I’m a package being delivered. Property exchanging hands.

I know this is a long time ago, but memories exist in the present. It’s here with me now. I can feel it like needles in my spine.

Those other people, whose faces are blurs, take me to yet another room, this one with a strange enclosure in the center. The whole room is a big circle. They bring me to the center of the center and put me in a chair. Strap me to a chair.

The men in that room, all of them wore suits. Not hazmat or isolation. Business suits, with ties. One of them had a cowboy hat on, just like the mascot. I remember that vividly. The cowboy hat.

They use words, but I don’t hear them. They point at me, then at the mascot. It comes closer and stands over me. That huge face. It reaches for its head and begins to take it off. In this moment, I first feel the terror that will haunt me the rest of my life. The unveiling. The point of fear.

But then I can’t remember. I remember the terror, the buildup, but the climax never arrives. I’m left perpetually hanging, adrift in the air. Doomed to ruminate for years to come.

The man with the hat smiles at me and points to the room full of costumes.

Right now, thinking back, I don’t know if he said something to me. Maybe what’s heard doesn’t extend as far back as what’s felt. Maybe it’s just that I’m forgetting. It was a long time ago. It’s been a long, long time.

But what I feel is this: the costumes in that other room, those rows of mascot heads and bodies, they belong to me. Or rather, I belong to them.

\*\*\*

Next thing I know, I’m back with my mother. I’m holding her hand. For some reason, I’m not scared. I’m not crying. Instead, I feel as if pulled from a dream, as if lifting from a daze. Like coming out of surgery. A day at the dentist. 

She doesn’t seem upset that I was gone. In fact, it doesn’t seem like I was gone at all. There’s ice cream in my hand. The wind is sweeping across my face, my hair. I have to shield my eyes from the sun. 

A part of me wants to believe it’s a falsehood, or that it was part of some “ride” I was too young to comprehend. A big part of me. Most of me, really. That would make this all so much easier. But I can’t, because of what I saw next.

I know what I saw. I’ve thought about it for decades. I haven’t been able to think of anything else. I’m thinking about it now.

I see a man walking in the other direction, coming my way. In each hand, he’s holding the hand of a little boy. I’m caught up looking at the man’s suit. It looks like the one I’d seen in the room. They pass on the left, and when they do, I notice the boys for the first time. They both look the same, like twins, or copies. They look familiar. Strikingly familiar.

It takes a moment to register. My mother is saying something, pointing at some attraction. The face. The face on those boys. It’s the same one I see in the mirror. The face in the closet, inside the costume. It’s my face.

It’s me.

\*\*\*

Tonight, thinking through everything, trying to put the pieces together again for the millionth time, I can’t eat. My fingers won’t stop shaking. There’s a layer of dread over my apartment. Over my life. A constant reminder that, ultimately, I cannot tell if I am real. If I am the original, or if I am one of the copies.

And if I am real, isn’t that worse? That I can’t tell? What would the others have to say about that? Surely, they would be jealous of my supposed freedom. I know what I would want if I were one of the copies. I’d want the life I thought was my own. I’d want to creep into my house one night, hide in the closet, or outside the window, and wait for the perfect moment. I would disrobe my costume, sneak over to the real me, and stuff him inside it. I would replace him. I would take my rightful spot as a real, living person.

*It is your turn to wear the mask*.

I’m halfway dressed and walking towards the parking lot before I realize what I’m doing. My hands turn the keys in the ignition. It’ll be a long drive. But I know the alternative is impossible. I can’t sit and wait and pretend. I can’t *not* know. What’s a few hours compared to a lifetime? It’s the easiest decision I’ve ever made. 

As I’m pulling out of the parking lot, I expect my anxiety to dissipate. It does not. It grows. I realize: this is me opening the closet. I’m doing what I know I shouldn’t. I’m driving to the point of fear. And I can’t stop myself.

\*\*\*

It’s hours into the drive. The interstate is lonely under all the stars. So many stars. They remind me of the tacky white stickers I had stuck to my ceiling as a child. When I was younger, it didn’t matter if the stars were fake. I couldn’t tell the difference. Growing up in the city, I never saw the real ones. Maybe that’s how you know something is fake. Once you see the real thing, you can tell. But what if you never saw the real thing? Would you even know the imitation was fake? 

My mind lingers in that old bedroom. If anyone were to know, it would be her. I need gas anyway. I pull over and pump some into the tank. I ask the clerk where the phone is. She hands over her cell and smiles. I’m shaken. I don’t know why. 

I step to the back of the store and dial my mother’s number. It’s late, but she’s probably awake. It rings. Once, twice. Voicemail. I wait for the beep.

“I don’t know what I’m doing,” I confess. “I thought maybe you would want to hear my voice again. It’s been a long time, I understand. But…” Someone shuffles into the store and greases over to the beer. I tuck in. “I suppose I want you to know I’m finally ready. I’m on my way now. But I had a question about something—"

 A voice picks up.

“Hello? Who’s calling so late?”

“Mom,” I say. “It’s me.”

“Huh? Who?”

“I have something I need to ask. Remember that theme park? Do you remember that day we went?”

There’s some sort of chatter on the other end. Voices in the background. “I don’t think you have the right number.”

“I need to ask. Did I ever leave your sight? Did you lose me, even for a minute?”

“I’m going to hang up.”

“I have to know, mom. Please. Am I one of them?”

“Don’t call here again.” The line clicks. It goes dead.

\*\*\*

How much do I remember of yesterday? And the day before it? What determines what is stored in memory and what is discarded? How much of my life do I *really* remember?

I pull off the highway and onto an access road paved in dirt. There’s nothing, no one, out here. A panic resurges in my chest when I see the dilapidated sign announcing the park’s lead-in drive. I take a right and make my way down the mud-caked path. 

Sitting there in the abandoned lot, looking at the chain link fence surrounding the park, I’m fighting the urge to pass out. My head swims. I brace my hands against the steering wheel and count my breaths. It doesn’t help. I open the door and stick my head out and vomit. The smell of rust floods my nose. I don’t want to be here. I would do anything not to be here.

I take the flashlight and the revolver out of the glove box and head toward the gated entrance. Everything is covered in moss and graffiti. I make sure the gun is loaded. I push deeper in.

I step over cracked concrete and weeds spilling through it. Loose bits of trash scatter in the wind at my feet. An aching loneliness haunts the park. Years of neglect wrinkle every surface. And yet, I feel the eyes watching me more than ever before. A staggering gaze hides behind the shattered windows and crumbling architecture. Goosebumps cover my skin. In the distance, I see the remains of a dried-out fountain. I remember. The center of the park.

I’m crossing to the fountain when, out of the corner of my eye, I see something move. I grip the revolver hard enough to leave indentations in my palm. I’m shaking again. I shouldn’t be here. I should leave.

Crossing to the corner where I saw the movement, I’m stricken with an overwhelming feeling of dread.  I know what I am about to see, I know where I am being led. I come to an alley between two corroded buildings, both of which are too barren to make out their original intention. Empty shelves lie knocked on their sides, bent and dented. Shards of glass litter the floor. The space-themed paint job in the interior is splotched with decay. Insulation bulges from sodden ceiling panels. In the back of the alley is a door leading to the employees-only building of the park. The wind blows it open. Unlocked. Waiting.

What am I supposed to do? I can’t do anything else. I walk through the doorway. I approach the point of fear.

\*\*\*

The restricted section looks very much like the rest of the park, minus the themed decor. Discolored, cracked concrete and nature assuming its place. Part of it seems to have been a lounge, judging by the rotted wood bar and overturned barstools. Dangling from one of the two doorways in the room is a metal placard. Most of it is rusted over. I pull it down with ease and wipe off the collected dust. My heart lurches up my throat.

*Costuming*

I’m here. I am here. Somewhere in the trenches of the room is the answer. The answer to end all questions. My hands are shaking again. I feel dizzy, out of balance. I grip the door frame and steady myself. I stagger into the room. A locker room. Most of the lockers are torn open and wrapped in graffiti. It’s not long. It’s a short room with a hall on the right. An “L” shape. The beam on my flashlight stutters as I approach the corner. I hit it once, twice, waiting for the beam to brighten. In the back of the corner, I see it. It’s faded and covered in dust and chunks of it have been chewed away by insects but there it is. The costume. It lies dead in the back, its head propped against the wall.

*So, you finally came.*

I approach the suit. One step at a time. Gun raised, flashlight trained. That goddamn smile. That goddamn, stupid hat. I perch the flashlight in my teeth while I grip the head. I twist. The mechanism unlatches. The head is loose in my hands. Ready to be removed. The unveiling. I can hardly breathe. 

I take.

Off.

The mask.

And that’s when everything changes.

\*\*\*

*It’s been so long since I’ve been back. I know I have a home somewhere, but I’ve never been. A man who isn’t me lives there. He’s lived there for a long time, far too long. And now I know where he lives. I know where I can find my home.*

*I pull the keys from the pockets. I take the gun, the flashlight. Just in case.* 

*The car is easy to find. It’s the only one in the lot. The night is bright with stars. It is a nice night.*

 *I drive the limit the whole way back. The drive is pleasant. By the time I get to the house, the sun is peeking over the horizon.*

*I open the door, go upstairs. Here’s where he sleeps. I know where he sleeps.*

*I tuck myself into the closet and close the door. He’ll be here anytime.*

*I’ve waited so long.* 

*I can wait a little longer.*
