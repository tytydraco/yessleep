I was 16 when it started. The first time I saw it, I was in my sister's room playing minecraft on her Playstation 4. Coral blocks had just been introduced to the game and so I was deeply invested in the underwater city I was making.
My sister, 18 at the time, was blasting SOAD and chilling out along the north side of her bed. We were in our element just doing whatever we so pleased. 

All of the sudden, deep pulsating spikes of adrenaline replaced my breathing. I felt a fiery hot fear pierce my heart and tug my attention tords the closet. 

There, standing perfectly still was a figure. It stared at me between the cracks of the closed closet doors. The eyes seemed to blend in with the shadows, keeping my gaze as it breathed ever so slowly.

I kept staring. 

When my sister finally caught on. She asked me what was wrong. Remembering it now, I musta have scared her so bad. Her voice shook as she tried to snap me out of it.

I didn't reply. I was frozen with terror and anticipation. The figure loomed, not saying a word.

Quietly as to not let the figure know that I was speaking about it, I asked my sister "Can you see it?" 

My sister, Instead of replying, put down her phone and full force opened the closet door. 

"See what?"

We were both confused at this point. Though the closet seemed empty at a glance, the dread hadn't subsided. In fact, it seemed to grow worse the longer I stayed in that little room with my sister. Only when I excused myself did the anxiety lessen. 

Now, when I say this was the "fist occurrence" I don't want you to assume that I see these figures often or as articulated vivid creatures.

These figures are rare. They appear as dark clouds of smoke creating the illusion of humanity. No clothes, no mouth, no movement. Each one seems to exude a different aura. 

Seldom do I see multiple at once but it has happened. 

Ever since the night of the closet, these figures have followed me. 

I've seen them at the bus stop, at the door of my baby brother's bedroom, and at the base of my bed. 

This next story is hard for me to write but I know that I should.

I'm only including this part because I feel like the more I talk about them, the more they listen. It sounds crazy, even as the person telling the story, but it's like these figures perk up everytime I acknowledge their existence. I don't want all of them to reveal themselves again but if that's what it takes, I will consider it a casualty of my true ambition. 

My sister passed away a few years after the closet encounter. At the time, my father was in a relationship with a devout woman. I wasn't ever too close to her as she struck me as an odd person. I know that's pretty judgmental for someone who sees smog people but It's hard to explain her any other way. She was... different. Very different.

As you can expect, I was in deep mourning. The figures were more active than they had ever been. I would see them in broad daylight, watching me as I went about my day. Me and the figures stared at eachother for hours during the night almost as an endurance test to see who would let up first. I rarely won. 

After a little while, I had stopped talking altogether. My father suffered from a case of "Broken heart syndrome" (no worries, he's okay now) and I begun to loose emotion. This warped my perception on the figures. On one hand, I was no longer scared but on the other hand, I could also no longer feel happiness or much of anything.

So about a week after my sister's passing, my kooky step mom walked into my room. She sat next to me on the edge of my bed and asked how I was doing. This was a first for her. In a moment of weakness I told her everything. I told her about the figures and about loosing emotion. I told her that I didn't know what to do without my older sister and how she was my everything.

That was when my step mom asked if I had ever leaned into it.

"What?" I cried.

"I won't let them hurt you. Just lean into it" "let them come."

She put her hand on mine and instructed me to imagine a figure. To focus on the feeling and let it take over. She told me to yell "GO AWAY. YOU DON'T BELONG HERE" as soon as I felt overwhelmed. I looked at her like she was ridiculous but her nurturing gaze reasured me.

And so I focused. 

She dimmed the lights and closed the door. It was just me and her now in my lonely room. 

Suddenly, my attention was directed tords the closet where I began to make out a dark figure. As clear as day, an emaciated person sat with it's head in between it's lap. It's arms were stretched across either knee as if holding itself. I stared at it, holding my breath. My heart was thumping so fast that I clutched my hand to my chest and audibly gasped fpr air. An overwhelming sadness loomed over me and I couldn't take it anymore. "GO AWAY. YOU DON'T BELONG HERE" I shouted. I screamed it at the top of my lungs over and over again. "GO AWAY. YOU DON'T BELONG HERE"

Then as fast as it appeared, it was gone. My step mom turned on the light and asked me what I saw. I explained to her in full detail. I told her how odly vivid it was and how I felt like I was drowning. She cut me off.

Did you say it was sitting against the closet door mirror? 

"Yes, I assured her."

"And it was curled up in a ball with it's head between it's legs?"

"Yes," I assured her again 

"Honey....,



"That was the position your sister was found in."



It's been 3 years and I haven't seen a figure since. I've talked to counselors, psychiatrists, and therapists and each one has dismissed the sightings as nothing but stress based hallucinations.They tell me it is a product of my environment and nothing more. I want to believe them but maybe if I explained it to them as I've explained it to you, they would rethink their diagnosis.

After all that, I would still give anything to see my big sister again. I miss her each and everyday. My sister was my everything and if seeing her again means reawakening those that stalked me for so long, so be it.

As long as I can say goodbye the proper way this time. I can handle it.


EDIT: I've altered a few details. I feel like the specifics are one, a little too personal, and two, could possibly be recognized by the few people who know about my visitors. So, if you find this post and think you know me, f@$% off. Your opinion is horse @%&#. Let the ever-growing interweb swallow my words into the endless sea of anecdotes and cumulative nonsense. It will be forgotten all the same.
