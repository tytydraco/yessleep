Hi Reddit

I heard people come hear to talk about supernatural or unsettling events they experienced during their day to day life and I believe my experience counts as one such event.

A week from now I started having strange dreams, or rather strange nightmares.

All of them have one thing in common with one another, they always start in a field of red flowers

Every time it’s the same: around me I see nothing from miles, a weak breeze howls softly in my ears, and a gentle smell fills my nostrils.

The sky is a bright light blue, and white clouds move slowly across its surface.

If I look up, I see no sun

When I look down I see the flowers.

In my mind’s eye their shape is blurry and constantly twirling, but I can clearly see their color

A dark shade of red that contrast the green grass growing alongside them.

My head spins if I look at them for too long, giving them a clear shape is too much for my mind to bear.

I don’t feel serene in this field, I don’t feel safe, but I don’t feel threatened either, yet I sense that I’m being watched.

I know full well it’s a dream

 when I look at my hands there are too many fingers or too less.

When I touch my body I feel my hands sinking into my flesh as if it was clay.

An old record player appears somewhere around me, I don’t know how I’m able to grasp that it has appeared, I just know.

In my twisted hands, a record disk manifests from thin air.

The label is always different, and it’s always too blurry to read.

I feel compelled to insert the disk, because deep down I know I have no choice.

Then a music track, different for each disk, for each night, plays in the recesses of my mind, echoing throughout my thoughts.

Its always distorted in some way, yet for some reason, it feels like these discorded notes complement the song, it almost make me feel serene.

Then I feel my body melting away

It’s not painful, but it feels way too real

I want to wake up, but I can’t

My body folds upon itself and everything turns dark.

Then suddenly, the music stops, and I’m somewhere else, but I don’t feel like me, it’s as if my body took someone else’s shape.

It doesn’t feel wrong though, for a brief moment I would dare to say that it feels ecstatic

Then I realize where I am.

 Every time something different happens, I’m always some place new, as someone new

When I wake up, I feel changed, as if I gained something I cannot grasp.

I know I should be scared of what it’s happening to me, but for some reason, I’m always eager to go to sleep.

Does this happen to other people as well, I know I’m not the only one out there, I just feel it in my body, so if anyone of you has saw the field in your dreams, please…

Tell me everything
