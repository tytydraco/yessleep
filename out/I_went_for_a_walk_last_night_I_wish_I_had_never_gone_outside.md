Last night I found some strange things in the dark streets. My story started last night, after dinner. I was going outside for a short walk, through the dark streets. Soon I started to get a strange feeling of dread, and my head was hurting more and more. Soon I had to take a break on a hard bench. There I saw a figure in the distance with grey skin, pure black eyes and extremely long nails.  I thought it was probably somebody in a weird suit, but things quickly changed after that.

I started to be paranoid after a while, yet I didn’t know why.

Then I started seeing a hooded figure appearing and disappearing in the far-out woods, which I initially thought was just a normal person blurred by the dark distance between us. Yet soon it looked as though surfaces were melting, with my chair feeling strangely liquid.

I didn’t notice the time or what I was doing as I stayed in a tired, hallucinatory state on the bench.

I’d start to see the same creatures across my surroundings getting closer and closer to me, yet I could not quite make out what each of them were.

After some time I started to notice something strange was happening. The environment was getting strange and creepy over time. Soon I started to hear far-away screams getting louder over time. At 11, after two and a half hours of sitting on the same bench I decided to get up and  walk back home. Soon I was too tired to even stand up properly, collapsing on the asphalt.

I started to dream of strange terrifying sights, including the grey-skinned creature I had seen before. The terror continued half an hour later when I woke up. I looked towards the darkness next to an old building and saw a strange silhouette with long horns looking towards me.

Back then thought I was hallucinating, although now I wouldn’t be so sure. Soon I saw it approach one of the building’s few lights when I saw his skin was all red. Then I began to hear a strange voice in my head whispering: “Tom commands you.” By then I was starting to panic a bit.

The voice became more common, and the hooded figures and grey creatures appeared closer and closer. Madness was descending. I couldn’t think. I didn’t know why things were so tense, but something was clearly controlling my emotions. “Tom will soon appear.” said the voice in head. Soon madness would truly arise. I found myself close to home when the grey creature came to me saying: “I am the Unknown. Death will come to you.”, while blocking my way. Then came a hooded figure, whose head could not be seen, saying “I am Robert the Hooded Figure, and I will bring you to me as I did Martin.”

I shrieked in fear, yet nobody heard me. Then came another beast, with red skin, claws and gazelle horns. It the silhouette from before, now shown to be a gazelle demon. “I’m Martin the Gazelle Demon, and you will soon be just like me.” While I was cornered in the wall, another figure came, in the shape of ghost-like plume of black smoke. “I am Tom the morpher, that which makes Gazelle Demons.” it said.

My feet disintegrated, my head started to hurt more than ever before, the world looked as though it was melting and my skin turned red. The horns of a gazelle came out of my head as my nails turned to claws. Then my feet came back and my vision was normal, but the form I was in has not changed. I am a gazelle demon, just like Martin. I’ve been living in isolation ever since, fearing others may look down on my new form.
