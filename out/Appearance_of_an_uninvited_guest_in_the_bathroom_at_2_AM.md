Finally sharing this personal experience of mine bc I can finally joke about it now (kinda) as it had happened some time last year, but as it was happening, I have never felt immense fear and terror like that before. I had met *her* unexpectedly while I was spending the weekend over at my grandparents‚Äô house in Indonesia. She was my first-ever, firsthand encounter with the otherworldly and she chose to appear when I least expected it, at a place that I was so familiar with and holds a lot of attachments to. She was an uninvited guest at my grandparents‚Äô home that nobody knew about but me.

So the story goes, on my first night there, at around 2 AM. I finally felt sleepy enough to sleep so decided to go to the bathroom just right across the room I was staying at to pee before heading off to bed. The hallway was dark etc but nothing felt weird, it was a familiar sight and I sensed no danger/threat so I just walk right into the bathroom to quickly do my business. Again, nothing felt out of the ordinary, everything is as it usually is UNTIL‚Ä¶. I opened the bathroom door (to return to my room), AND THAT DOOR FLUNG BACK ON ITS OWN, SHUTTING IT AGAIN. And that was the moment‚Ä¶ i knew i was fucked ü•≤

Immediately, the bathroom light started flickering non-stop, reminiscent of a club but in the most horrific way considering my circumstances. Without much of a thought, i looked over my shoulder bc i felt a ‚Äòpresence‚Äô, AND SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A GIRL AT THE BACK OF THE BATHROOM AND SHE ISN‚ÄôT MOVING. However what‚Äôs weird was that i couldn‚Äôt really make out her full form (if that makes sense) or even her face bc strangely enough, she appeared to be quite blurry(?) although she was within close proximity. Which was probably for the better, so lucky me?? At a quick glance, I was only able to tell that she had a dishevelled hair and also what her body type was, she was very thin & skinny even under that bloodied & tattered long white dress she had on. THEN IT SUNKED IT AGAIN‚Ä¶ I WAS LOCKED INSIDE OF A HAUNTED BATHROOM WITH A FEMALE GHOST COVERED IN BLOOD STANDING STILL BEHIND ME WHILE THE LIGHTS ARE FLICKERING‚Ä¶. For maybe a good minute or two that felt like an eternity, I was frantically trying to open the door to no avail. Mind you, all that while I was screaming at the top of my lungs for help the entire time, but unfortunately both of my elderly grandparents has hearing problems, my grandpa esp has pretty much gone deaf, so my loud screams of pure terror wasn‚Äôt at all enough to wake any of them up ig. I was going insane.

For a second, it felt like I was on the verge of fainting due to shock and the sudden surge of fear that filled my entire body simply bc these things scares me down to the bone, the supernatural and Indonesia happens to be one of those highly superstitous & ‚Äòactive‚Äô countries‚Ä¶. Although I can also feel myself visibly shaking and my legs getting weak, the adrenaline was stopping me from fainting lol. To which would have been preferable considering I could‚Äôve just woken up the next day and start being in denial but i had to rmb all of this bc i stayed awake the entire time ü•≤ Anyways, the door finally opened and I sprinted into my room. I just could not believe it myself, I manage to escape completely unharmed. However, even if that was the case, I could not get even a wink of sleep that night after experiencing sth so traumatic and bc I was frightened at the idea that she might‚Äôve followed me in and continue to haunt me again. Thus, I decided to spent the entire night hiding under the covers so I won‚Äôt catch sight of *her* even if that was the case. Ignorance truly is bliss I thought.

The next morning I told the bravest and most experienced person on this topic at this property, one of my grandparents‚Äô long time worker, abt my experience last night and he told me that he‚Äôll look into it and try to figure out who she was lol. Tbh I just thought what I saw was the indo ghost called *Kuntilanak* solely from its appearance, the classic long black hair & white bloodied dress, and not anything else. Fast forward to the next day, sure enough, he said apparently after asking around, he found out that around last week, there was a young lady, a motorcyclist, who was unfortunately involved in a deadly accident that killed her on impact (in a gruesome manner‚Äîher head got sorta crushed etc) along the road of where my grandparents‚Äô house was situated on. 

This is where it gets a bit icky bc now a ‚Äòparanormal‚Äô is involved after I told my highly superstitious dad abt this. So according to my dad‚Äôs long-time trusted paranormal (yes this is a thing in Indonesia, kind of like how each family has their own family doctor, tho i‚Äôve always thought he‚Äôs full of BS ever since I was a kid lol) that had managed to communicate with *her*, as a result of her very sudden death, she was not able to rest in peace, moreover move onto the next stage of death. Hence, she resorted to showing herself to me (forcefully) which was apparently her way of seeking help, my help that night (i forgot why or what to help her with but i srsly dunno why does it have to be me of all ppl in the area). In the end, the paranormal decided to just pray for her and he either said she was moved out of my grandparents‚Äô property by him or was able to move onto the afterlife with the help of his prayer, i can‚Äôt rmb bc it‚Äôs been at least half a year since it happened. But either way, he said he feels bad for her and pities her so he decided to help her. Afterwards, that paranormal kept reassuring us that she was no longer at my grandparents‚Äô house and that is all I care. I have never tested nor have the capacity to do a test anyway, his skill/ability/power/legitimacy but that was smth that I chose to believe in without questioning in order to give myself some peace of mind. I didn‚Äôt care if all that shit was made up by that paranormal, as long as she‚Äôs out.

End of story, honestly as I‚Äôm recounting all of this again in great detail for the first time in months to write this post‚Ä¶ on second thought, I think i‚Äôll for sure be traumatised for life lol. All bc it‚Äôs been, as i said, several months & the memory of physically being in that locked bathroom with *her* still sends chill down my spine ü•≤ I wish I could say that I was hallucinating at the time or sth but I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶. Since then, I have never agreed to spend another night at my grandparents‚Äô place when I visit Indo, as much as I cherished that place‚Ä¶ I just can‚Äôt get over my paranoia, it‚Äôs truly a shame but it is what it is‚Ä¶ üòÆ‚Äçüí®
