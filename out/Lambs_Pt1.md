I’m working through some stuff and I figured the best way to get this out is to put it into writing. This will likely be a long read and I will be dividing it up into parts as it all comes back to me.

  


It was summer break between my first and second year of community college and I was working at my old high school doing maintenance. Mowing grass, painting walls, moving furniture, and waxing floors were the basic duties of the job with some other randomly assorted tasks tacked on as well.

I had done it a few summers previous while I was actually in high school and had enjoyed it quite a bit. The job was pretty independent, I’d get a few work orders every morning and then I would go off and basically work alone all day unless I had to grab someone to help me get something moved which surprisingly despite being about 5 '8 and 130 pounds soaking wet wasn’t too often.

But this summer was a bit different as I guess I had impressed them the last few summers I had worked there so my boss had put me in charge of managing the other young maintenance workers who were all high school age. 

I distributed work orders every morning to about three other boys and made rounds to check up on their progress periodically throughout the day while also making sure that I got everything else done to help get it all fixed up and ready for the upcoming school year. 

Since counting myself we made up a team of four I divided us into groups of two so we could hopefully burn through work orders faster and there would always be someone around in case a job needed more than one person. I’d often pair Kyle and Parker up as they were pretty reliable and when they did slack off they were smart enough to do it out of sight. Then I would take Jake and essentially babysit him all day. Jake is actually my younger cousin and don’t get me wrong he’s a great kid but he’s about as useful as a pair of shitted white canvas pants.

The biggest job during the summer is getting the floors waxed. Most of the actual waxing was up to the janitor ladies with us pitching in whenever we had a lack of work orders to do. Our main responsibility was to move the furniture in and out of the rooms so the floor was open to be waxed. Our school district was relatively small so 6th-12th grade were all housed in the same building with the elementary school being in a different building right down the road. The first week was spent moving the middle school rooms, the next couple after were the high school, and then the last few weeks of summer were the elementary school as well as the agriculture building because those could both be done in a few days each. 

The summer was coming close to an end and by this point, we were essentially exiled from the high school campus as the janitor ladies were in the process of waxing all of the hallways while we were at the elementary school moving furniture into the halls from the classrooms.

“Can we take a break soon?” Jake asked as he slammed some poor teacher’s mini fridge onto the floor.

“God dammit, be careful! no, we’re almost done with this hall.” I said as I slowly walked a shelf filled with history books tipped back on a dolly out into the hall, feeling too lazy to even bother taking the books off of it.

“Well how many more do we have to do?!” he asked, taking his hat off and scratching his head.

“There’s like two more rooms down this hallway, Kyle and Parker should be done with their hall once we get those and then we’ll take a break until lunch,” I said, also not looking forward to moving two more rooms worth of these surprisingly huge kindergarten tables. 

We made quick work of the last few rooms. One benefit of working with Jake was that he was about twice my size so getting things lifted off the ground was easy, it was setting them back down was hard for him. I hoped to god no one would notice the nasty dents on the filing cabinet in the science room until the summer was over.

We both collapsed into the little class chairs on the wall next to the room we had just finished and took a quick breather.

“What we got after lunch?” he huffed out between breaths.

“As long as Kyle and Parker get their hall done we should be good to hide out somewhere and chill til’ four,” I said, checking my texts to make sure the actual maintenance manager hadn’t sent me any more work orders. “Then we’ll move these back in Tomorrow early and we can chill until we have to  start on the Agri building next week.”

“How hard is the agri building?”

“Not bad, it just smells fucking awful.”

One thing of significance about the school was we were one of only two districts in the state that had an on-campus meat lab and farm where the FFA students essentially ran their own school-sponsored slaughterhouse. 

I was in Agri for a short time in my freshman and sophomore years, mainly because they had field trips like twice a month and because I thought those ugly blue corduroy jackets were hilarious, but I did my best to avoid anything to do with the meat lab. You’d imagine it would just smell like dead animals, but the stench to me was closer to hot spoiled oranges, which sounds better but trust me it’s not. 

The strong tart stink of animal blood mixed with those same animals' feces and whatever chemicals they used to clean it once every year would force itself into the inside of my nostrils and soak itself well into the bridge of my nose and protrude out into the space between my brain and my optic nerves causing head splitting migraines and intense nausea. And of course, the August heat only soured the smell. The smell was strongest in the actual lab for sure but it would also leak itself well into the classrooms so any visit to the agri building whether it be in intense humidity or sharp stagnant cold was always an assault to the senses. Luckily the summer cleaning of the actual slaughter room was up to agri students looking for some extra credit.

The slaughter room looked almost identical to the setting of SAW without the toilets and emo puppet, but the sterile hospital white walls and dried black blood stains, drains overflowing with viscera and greywater were all the same. The whole room was tied together with some cage-like structure that I can’t figure out the exact name of. It was essentially a barred-off little walkway where cows and pigs were led through from the outside holding pens into a cage where a small opening allowed the students to reach through with a bolt pistol and pierce the brain of the animal, killing it instantly. Everyone who took agriculture as an elective in eighth grade got to spend the first day of class watching a live demonstration of this, it was pretty metal but decidedly not for me.

“Do we have to do anything at the farm?” Jake asked.

“No dude, that farm is beyond help.”

I assume the farm was once actually functioning but it had previously been used as a meth lab in the early 2000s -by another cousin of mine actually- and with it being a very short drive from campus the school got the property for super cheap using it to store livestock in disgusting Auschwitz style holding pens where the animals would sit in mud and their own filth until being cleaned up to travel to FFA shows or off to the pearly gates after a quick pit stop to the meat lab. 

The rest of the farm looked like the backdrop to a Slipknot video with a large white dilapidated barn and farmhouse that students were strictly forbidden to enter, according to the teachers this was to keep us from breaking it anymore but my friend Clint and I were pretty sure it was just cause they were too lazy to tear down the meth lab. 

“If *you* wanna volunteer to get tetanus I can text Paul, but I’m gonna go yoink some ice cream from the teacher's' lounge,” I joked as I stood up from the awkwardly short seats we were resting in.

Paul was the school's maintenance manager but he was also my church's pastor, a nice guy and the main reason I got the job in the first place. In fact he was such a nice guy I usually felt bad when I slacked off at work, but not bad enough to stop. The best part of working in a mostly empty school building is all the places where you can hide out to avoid being asked to do any more work, as well as all the stuff teachers leave behind at the end of the year.

I sleuthed my way over to the teacher's lounge door and slowly creaked it open. Relieved to see it was empty and the lights were off I flicked the light on and made my way over to the freezer drawer on the lounge fridge. I slid open the drawer to reveal, Shangri la, Ice cream sandwiches. I tossed one back to Jake hitting him in the nose before he clasped it in his hands. I quickly motioned him to book it out the door holding the sandwich between my teeth as I flicked the light off and closed the door as lightly as I possibly could.

“Alright, let's head off to the fort,” I said as I led him to the elementary library. 

As I said before, one of the biggest benefits of working in an empty school is the hiding spots, and with three summers under my belt, I had become quite skilled in finding spots that were equally comfortable and out of sight. At the high school I had set up what I called the “maintenance lounge" in a remote part of the school's attic above the coach's office in the gymnasium; making use of some discarded bean bags that I was supposed to throw out for a work order. But with us not having access to the high school for the time being I had now set up a home base in the elementary librarian's office. 

Jake and I opened the door to the pitch-black office before flicking on the tall reading lamp behind the love seat, just barely illuminating the room in warm orange light as we sat down and began to indulge in the ice cream sandwiches we had plundered.

While I was proud of my original hiding place at the high school, the office blew it out of the water. Nestled in the back corner of the library behind the book check-out counter and out of sight of any windows made it a perfect hideout A rather tasteful pee yellow loveseat, bohemian style rug, and mini Keurig coffee maker, complete with cheap Walmart brand foam coffee cups made a choice spot to take a break from the work day and watch tik tok, taking intermittent trips out to pretend like I was actually working on something. Overall just a nice welcoming place to relax from a hard three hours of actual work; almost made me want to be a librarian, but I’ve never been very good at bejeweled.

“You think Kyle and Parker are done with their hall yet?” Jake asked as he crumpled up the wrapper to his sandwich and threw it at the wastebasket punctuating his question with an at-the-time inappropriate “Kobe!”, completely missing.

Almost as though speaking their names summoned them, Kyle and Parker opened the office door.

“*Dammit*, they beat us to the couch,” Kyle sighed as he assumed a crisscross applesauce position on the rug, Parker following.

“If you want the couch you guys gotta start moving rooms faster,” I joked as I reached to grab Jake's discarded wrapper.

“*That’s not fair*, you always pair up with *Jake*, he could tear through every room here in a day,” Parker said.

“Yeah Jake would literally *tear* through every piece of furniture he came across if I wasn’t with him, he’s like a hurricane with a shitty mullet and room temp IQ.”

“My mullet rules,” Jake said, without a hint of irony.

“I spent three summers up here moving rooms by myself and this is the only year we’ve been behind schedule,” I said.

“That’s bull, there’s no way you got through all this shit by yourself faster than us, you’re small enough to fit in a Tonka truck.” Kyle jeered.

“*Bitch*, I might be little, but I’m wiry,” I shot back “And moving furniture isn’t all about lifting, it’s about problem-solving. Ya’ll have yet to learn the true utility of a floor dolly. You could move a building if you had enough floor dollies.”

“That’s true, I use floor dollies to get Parker's mom back to the bedroom time to time,” Kyle said

“You wouldn’t be able to handle my mom,” Parker said.

“Yeah, bridges can barely handle Parker's mom,” I said to cap off the exchange.

We sat in silence for about 30 minutes, the only sound being the ambiance of TikToks from each of our phones overlapping each other.

I put my phone down and lifted my hat to scratch my head.

“God, I do not want to do the Ag building,” I said breaking the silence

“I thought Paul said we were skipping the Ag building this summer?” Kyle asked, looking to Parker for assurance.

“Yeah, he said the Agri kids volunteered to take care of the whole thing this year.”

“Oh shit, really?” I asked, Paul must have forgotten to pass this information on to me.

“You might text him and ask to double-check,” Parker suggested.

“I’ll just ask him if I run into him later, if I text him he’ll probably send us something else to do and we’re about 15 minutes from lunch.”

“We doing Sonic again?” Jake asked.

“What else is there?” I asked as I stood up from my seat and stretched.”Actually, I think I’m ready to head there now,” I said, gaining nods from the rest of the boys. The other three stood up and we piled out of the office and made our way out of the library. 

Of course who else would be in the hall when we all walked out but Paul himself?

“Great work guys, looks like you’re just about finished up here!” he said as he approached us. “Something wrong in the library?” 

“Oh no, we were just making sure none of the fluorescents or ceiling tiles needed changing,” I said quickly before any of the others could make up a worse lie.

“I really appreciate all the hard work you guys do,” Paul said with a smile, giving me a pat on the shoulder. Almost made me feel guilty, to get praised after an hour of TikTok time.

“Hey, so are we doing the Ag building this summer?” I asked trying to hide how excited the idea made me.

“That’s actually what I came down here to talk to ya’ll about. The Ag department has decided to do their own maintenance this year, get those kids some real work experience yanno’,’ he said. 

Don’t get me wrong I was not excited about moving out the Agri building but something about the way he relayed the information seemed off. There was a light tremble to his voice, which if you had ever spoken to Paul was extremely unusual. He was always overwhelmingly positive, like an actual ray of sunshine come to life, it was almost annoying. What was even more shocking was what he said next.

“Actually, you boys have done so well this summer, I don’t think there's much else left to do. So I was gonna ask if you might turn in your keys at the end of the day and we’ll cap this summer off early. I’ll take care of moving the rest of the rooms and you guys can take a couple weeks off before school starts back and you’ll get paid for the full summer, I’m sure you guys could use the rest,” he said with a cracking smile.

This was on the one hand awesome, but on another hand confusing. We had made slower progress this summer than any other one I had worked before and Paul was going to move every single room by himself, and pay us for not being there? Either way, the alarm bells going off in my head were tuned out by my internal celebration of being paid to do nothing.

Like Paul said I turned my keys to the school in and said some final goodbyes to Kyle and Parker who, for my sake, I hoped I wouldn’t see again. They were chill guys, but outside of work, I didn’t have much interest in being around seventeen-year-olds. 

I drove Jake back to his house, wished him luck on his senior year, and gave him a mostly genuine good job for his work that summer, and headed back to my house to relax, kick off my work boots, and chill for the next few weeks until classes started back.

I pulled into the driveway of my house and thanked god that my dad wasn’t home yet. This meant I could sit back in the recliner and watch a movie without the sullen heavy silence that my father and I had been engaged in for the last year weighing on the back of my neck. I knew he’d be home around 8 and once that happened I’d have to escape to Clint's trailer for the night, but for the time being I would turn on the first dumb Seth Rogen movie I could find on Netflix and pass out. 

Like clockwork, my dad made his way through the front door as I was in the kitchen doing some dishes before heading off to Clint's.

“Son,” He said with a downward nod of his head as he slapped his truck keys onto the counter.

“Dad,” I said putting the last of the silverware into the dishwasher and turning it on.

We awkwardly stared at each other in the kitchen for a few minutes, a silence so loud that it couldn’t even be dulled by the whirring of the dishwasher as I waited to see if he might grace me with some form of communication.

I decided to take the first step, as I always had to. “ I think I’m gonna head over to Clint’s here in bit,” I said. 

 “Clint?” Is all he asked.

“My friend, Clint…” 

He just stared back at me,

“He used to come over here every day when I was in high school? I go to his house like every day.”

My dad just stood still for a few more minutes before finally opening his mouth to ask,” You ever hang out with girls?”

We both knew the answer to that so I grabbed my phone and wallet and made my way past him and off to my truck.

I pulled into the rutted-up grass which made Clint’s “Driveway” and made sure to run the front bumper of my truck ever so slightly into the side of his camper just to piss him off. Likely feeling the shake he kicked open his camper's door and lumbered down the two metal steps and out to the grass. He must have already had to go somewhere that morning because rather than wearing his favorite smiley face flip flops he stepped out wearing a pair of tennis shoes and sweat pants, dab pen in hand.

“You’re dad home?” was all he asked as I hopped out of my truck.

“No, I actually just came here to meet your mom.”

“Oh, so you found her?” He chuckled.

“You find mine and I’ll find yours,” I joked as we stepped back up into the camper.

We played a few rounds of Smash Brothers on his Switch, me of course losing every single game and passing the dab pen back and forth.

“You staying the night?” he asked between hits.

“Probably staying for the week, Schools all done apparently.”

“Damn, that's kind of early isn’t it?”

“Super early, but I’m getting paid for the full time so I’m not complaining.”

“You still going back to school?”

“Yessir,” I said,” Figured my mom might want me to finish.”

“You still haven’t heard from her?”

“Nah, man.”

“Jesus, your Dad must have really pissed her off, it’s been like a year.”

“He’s probably got her tied up in the shed or some shit, he’s lost it, I don’t think I’ve heard him say more than five sentences since she left.”

“I mean.. Are you sure he doesn’t” Clint asked with a nervous chuckle.

Clint asked that as a joke obviously but the idea had been clawing at me for a while. My parents had their fair share of issues but no more than anyone else's I’d imagine. My mom had seemed kind of distant for a while before she left, most of what she did was just cook and clean, just seemed distracted most of the time, but not angry. Then one day I get home and all my mom and my sisters' things are just gone. I had heard my Dad and her arguing the night before, but my usual response to things like that was to just put on some music and smoke myself to sleep, so I had no idea what It could have been about. 

“I don’t know, I’ve talked to my grandpa on the phone, he says she’s staying with him, but I guess she doesn't wanna see anyone, doesn’t even go to work anymore. Steph calls me and visits from time to time but she just seems out of it, I think she’s been drinking. I feel like if something was fishy about it they’d seem more freaked out.”

“What does your dad say?” Clint asked.

“Nothing. Won’t even tell me what they’re fighting about. All I get from him is the general run around ‘You’ll understand when you’re older,”, like brother, I’m twenty.”

“So weird man -you know- I think Collin’s mom bounced around the same time,” Clint said. “Ya’ll’s mom’s probably hopped on a bus and went out to Vegas.”

I think Clint probably expected a laugh or something but I had gotten sort of lost in my thoughts. I don’t know how I hadn’t ever put that together myself. Collin was another close friend of ours, he and I had a few bonding moments over each other's mom leaving. I had always chalked it up to just shared tough luck but now putting that together gave me a cold feeling on the back of my neck.

Before I could properly organize what I was working out in my head, Clint interrupted.

“Hey, so the school’s done?” 

“Yeah,” I said quickly pulling myself from the fog in my brain.

“You still have your keys?”

“No, I had to turn them in.”

“Damn, I was gonna suggest some Skateboard-Basketball.”

Skateboard-Basketball was a game we had invented the first summer I worked at the school. We would use my keys to get into the gymnasium at night taking our skateboards with us and rolling them around the court to play games of Horse. It would usually just turn into us chucking the basketballs at each other's legs trying to throw the other off their board.

“Wait, didn’t you make a spare at Walmart last summer?” Clint asked.

“Oh shit, you’re right, It’s probably buried in one of the drawers at home,” I said.

“Well shit, let’s go find it and grab the boards.”

“Come on dude, I don’t wanna deal with my dad tonight.”

“We won’t have to, it’s like 10, he’s probably already in bed.”

“I don’t know man.”

“If you don’t get up off that couch and into your truck, I’m going to pull down my pants and jack off all over your face.”

“Ugh, fine; I can’t get pink eye again,” I said as I stood up and pulled my keys out of my pocket.

To my shock, when my headlights hit the front of my house they did not bounce off the back of my dad's truck. He was gone. My dad did not have the work schedule to fit in late-night trips so this was concerning. But I was much more relieved than I was concerned.

After about an hour of tearing my already wrecked room apart, we found the key in my drawer next to an old pair of underwear and mouse pellets. With that I walked to the laundry room and grabbed a flashlight from the cabinet above the washing machine, flicking it on to make sure the batteries weren’t dead.

“What do we need that for?” Clint asked. 

“I left my skateboard in the shed.” 

I wasn’t much of a skater anymore, not that I ever was, I did like half of a pop shove-it once but other than that the only times I had touched it since high school was for our once-summer basketball games, so most of the time it sat in the shed. 

“You sure it’s there.”

“I know it is, I put it in there the night before my mom left.”

Though I lived in a sort of crappy 80’s style double-wide trailer, we had quite a good bit of land. My dad's shed was on the back side of my house down a hill, completely cloaked in darkness at night. I shone the light down the hill as Clint and I made our way to the shed.

The fog had begun to roll in on account of the summer humidity which created a smokey wall around us.

“Woah, dude, like Silent Hill!” Clint said in a sarcastic “dumb guy” voice. We shared a short laugh and continued through to the shed. 

We stifled our steps as we heard a panicked slamming coming from the fog. We shared a quick concerned look and slowly continued on. The fog began to split and the shed came into view, as the banging became louder. 

The brittle wooden door was shaking on its hinges violently as something inside slammed into it.

Clint looked to me; the whites of his eyes were wider than I had ever seen.

I slowly inched closer to the door. The banging was now a constant frantic crashing. Whatever was inside was desperate to get out. In one breath I threw my palm at the sliding lock flinging it back. 

The door swung open slamming me in the forehead and back onto my ass. As I fell I let out a girlish shriek and squirmed on my back holding my arms over my face. Something small and furry scurried over my body and up to my forearm causing me to fling it to my right side. leaves rustled as it fled and Clint began to laugh violently.

“*It was a fucking possum dude!”*

“I know that!” I huffed as I stood back up holding my right hip with one hand with my wrist pressed to my head. 

“Let’s just get the fucking board.” 

We threw my skateboard into the back seat of my truck and made our way out to the high school. As we made our way through town, the gas station Collin worked at was coming up on our right side.

“Oh shit I think Collin’s working tonight, let’s stop for a second.” 

I swerved into the parking lot and up to the front door where Collin was standing outside, having a cigarette.

Collin gave us the usual “What’s up,” when we hopped out of the truck.

“We’re about to head up to do some Skateboarding in the high school,” Clint answered.

“Man, yall always do the fun shit while I’m at work.” He looked at me and said, “Oh dude, I saw your dad in here just a second ago. He bought a bundle of firewood?”

“What? Did he say where he was going?” I asked

“No dude, your dad's a fuckin’ mute.”

“He’s probably just burning his wife’s corpse,” Clint said.

Not picking up on the joke, Collin looked to me concerned and asked,” Is that where she’s been?!”

“No, Collin, my dad didn’t kill my mom.. I think,” I said.

“Well that’s good, I’m starting to wonder about mine honestly. Her phone number's gone dead, not like she ever answered before but still, it was nice to be able to hear her voicemail message.”

“Jesus man I’m sorry.” was all I could think to say.

Clint hated awkward tension so he chimed in with,“Guys, I’m telling you, your moms are just getting some nice fresh love from some casino bouncer in Vegas.” he got a quick laugh out of us. He continued,”You guys are just fresh to the no-mom club, My mom's been in Washington with her new family since I was in second grade. I promise you’ll be fine.

We continued on with the small talk for a short while before another truck pulled up next to mine. We watched as a short fat man piled out along with a woman. As we stood near the register chatting with Collin, we watched them make their way up to the door. I recognized them. It was Mr. and Mrs. Harper. Mrs. Harper was my art teacher and high school, one of the few teachers I actually liked. She and her husband were also regular attendees at the church I went to. When they walked in Mr. Harper immediately slammed down a twenty and asked for a pack of Grand Prix menthols, less asked more demanded with a question mark tossed in towards the end.

Mrs. Harper stood silently behind him, she seemed different than I remembered her. She seemed confused. I gave her a small wave, which she seemed to completely miss.

“Hi, Mrs. Harper, I said.”

Her head perked up slightly and she took a minute to eke out a weak, “Oh, hello” followed by a harsh and disingenuous smile. She must have just not recognized me, which hurt slightly but made sense. I'd been out of high school for about two years and she was a bit on the older side and had a good number of students to keep track of other than me.

“Sorry boys, Mrs. Harpers not feeling too well tonight. She just took her medicine,” Mr. Harper said as he wrapped one hand around the arm of Mrs. Harper.

Mrs. Harper continued to stare off at nothing in particular. Her eyes were dilated pupils about the size of quarters. Once Mr. Harper had grabbed his cigarettes and led her out the door there was a short silence among us.

“Dude! Mrs. Harper is high!” Clint said.

We all laughed and continued talking for a few more minutes before deciding to take off to the school and get to our basketball game. Once we made it to the school we pulled my truck to the back lot of the football field, behind the field house, and shut my headlights off doing our best to keep my white avalanche as hidden from the adjacent highway as possible. We were doing something that was not necessarily legal so we always did our best to hide my truck when we did this to not draw any unwanted attention. 

We began our trek, hauling our skateboards on our backs behind the bleachers and up the hill to the main high school campus which sat on a flat asphalt plateau.

“Do you smell smoke?” Clint asked.

I sniffed the air for a second and yes, I did smell smoke.

“Smells like a bonfire or something,” Clint said

“Who would be having a bonfire?” I asked

“Mormons?”

“We don’t have Mormons here; but maybe Pentecostals.”

We decided to delay our game for a second to see if we could find the source of the smell. We continued to walk up the hill but wrapped around the back of the school and to the opposite side where the middle school playground sat on a hill that looked down to the agri building. It was sort of an odd setup, the playground was essentially a parking lot with swings and a fenced-in basketball court. With a cement walkway leading away from the exit door. This was where the buses would park at the end of the day to pick up the kids. The agri building was down the hill with a back lot that cut into the hill creating a sort of cliff that looked over of the lot. Once we rounded the back wall to the playground we were immediately assaulted by a harsh glow of light coming from the agri buildings lot. Not only did we see the fire, but several trucks and cars parked right next to it.

“God I hope that's not a Klan meeting,” Clint said.

“No way, they do those a town over.”

We ditched our boards by the back wall and slinked our way over to the fence that sat over where the lot cut into the hillside and kept as low as possible to investigate the glow. We looked down and saw Paul in the center of a circle of around 20 people, most of which I recognized from church or just seeing them around town. It looked like he was giving some sort of fire-side sermon.

“I just feel so blessed to have you all out here tonight. I’m sure it brings a smile to the lord just to see all these folks willing to take the next step in their marriage, to honor his word.”

“*Oh my god they’re gonna have an orgy!*” Clint whispered to me. I gave him an elbow to the shoulder and gestured for him to be quiet.

“It takes a lot to make a marriage work, doesn’t it? It takes honesty, loyalty, patience, and humility. Ephesians five and twenty-two tell us,’ wives submit to your husbands as to the lord’, these are the words of God himself. Yet, do we see these values held up in the world? Divorce, adultery, mothers leaving their children at home to toil away at work.” He preached as he paced back and forth pointing to those in the crowd.

“Our world has strayed far from God's teachings in so many ways, but we will take it back my brothers and sisters. But before we can change the world, we must make changes in our home.” He paused as a group of men walked in from the crowd next to him. Two men were holding a woman by her arms as she fought against them, kicking and screaming. Another stood alongside, closest to Paul, and shook his hand.

“*Brother Henry*, tell us what *sin* has infected your home!” Paul commanded, shouting as to overpower the wailing of the woman next to him.

Henry said,“I caught my wife, Susana, in our home, in our bed, with another man,” All the men in the crowd shook their heads while their wives stood still as boards.

Paul took over once more,“Coveting another man, Susana, is a sin! next to taking the life of another!” He leaned in inches away from her tear-covered face and continued,’ To engage in acts with another man, acts of which should only be done with your husband, is akin to spitting on the grounds where Jesus spilled his blood so you might be free of sin. What say you for yourself, Susana?” 

Susana’s wailing quieted to a sob, and then to a whimper, she sniffed and her face turned to a scowl as she began to speak,’ I have loved the lord with all my heart, for all my life. I have given my heart and my soul to God. I love my God and I know he loves me.” her words shook out of her as she spoke. She turned her head to look toward Henry as if she were trying to turn the tears that left her eyes to knives. “I love my Lord in comparison to no other, but Henry, with every drop of blood in my body, I hate you.”

“Damn,” Clint whispered.

“Susana, you are sick, infected by the rot of the world. But by the grace of God, you will be cured.”

As soon as he said this, a man walked out from the meat lab holding something wrapped in a white sheet. A few other members of the congregation scooted a table out in front of Paul and the men. The man holding the sheet set it down on the table. Once he came into the light, I could see that the man was my father.

Clint looked at me as if waiting for me to say something, but I couldn’t.

My dad unwrapped the sheet to reveal a small white lamb on the table. He then took a buck knife sheathed on his belt loop and cut the lamb's throat while other members of the crowd held a steel bowl to catch the blood. The bowl was then passed around as members of the crowd held out mason jars, filling them up and sealing them shut.

Paul then took what remained of the blood and filled a small syringe. Susana began to wail once more as he approached. The men who held her cupped her mouth and held out her arm as Paul injected the blood into the veins on her forearm.

Susana shook and fought for a few more seconds before suddenly stopping. She didn’t go limp, she stood straight up and the rage and pain on her face vanished as the men let her go. She stood there, like a doll, as Henry walked to her and held her hand.

Paul walked approached Susana, patted her on the shoulder, and looked at Henry.
