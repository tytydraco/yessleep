The crash was the easy part.

One second, I was gripping the wheel, my headlights cutting through the rain, the next—I was spinning. Metal groaned. My tires lifted off the ground. A sickening lurch twisted my stomach as the car flipped, slammed into something hard, and came to a rest upside down. For a moment, all I could hear was my own breath, ragged and sharp in the suffocating silence.

Then came the pain.

A deep, searing ache in my ribs. A hot trickle down my forehead. My fingers trembled as I unbuckled myself, dropping onto the roof of the car. The windshield was shattered, glass scattered like jagged stars in the dim glow of my dying headlights.

I had to get out.

The driver’s side was crushed against a tree, but the passenger door groaned open with effort. I crawled through, wincing as twigs and stones bit into my palms. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, mist curling through the trees, thick and heavy. My phone was in my jacket pocket, but when I pulled it out, the screen was a spiderweb of cracks. Dead.

“Shit.”

I turned in a slow circle. The road was gone, lost somewhere behind a wall of trees. My car had veered deep into the woods. No headlights. No distant hum of passing cars. Just the chirp of unseen insects and the whisper of the wind. I sucked in a breath, tasting damp earth and the faint copper tang of blood.

I needed help.

A flicker of movement in the distance made me freeze. A shadow shifted between the trees, too far to make out. My pulse kicked up.

“Hello?” My voice was hoarse, raw from the crash.

Silence. Then—

A lantern flickered to life.

It wasn’t just a trick of my eyes. There was someone ahead, just beyond the mist. The glow wavered, then started toward me. Footsteps, slow and deliberate, crunched against the damp leaves.

Relief flooded me. “Hey! Thank God! I—”

The light stopped.

A figure stepped into view. An old man, hunched beneath a thick coat, his face shadowed beneath the brim of a wide hat. The lantern in his grip swayed gently, casting his features in flickering light. His eyes were pale, almost colorless.

“Car crash?” His voice was a rasp, like dead leaves dragged across stone.

I swallowed hard. “Yeah. Can you—do you have a phone? I need to call for help.”

He tilted his head slightly. “No phone. But my house ain’t far.”

I hesitated. The stranger studied me, unreadable. The woods stretched in every direction, a labyrinth of darkness. If I stayed, I risked hypothermia or worse. If I went…

“Alright,” I said. “Lead the way.”

The old man turned without another word, his lantern bobbing as he walked. I followed, my ribs protesting every step. The forest pressed in around us, the trees twisted and gnarled, their bark peeling in thick, curling strips. The farther we went, the quieter it became. The air felt wrong, thick with something I couldn’t name.

After what felt like forever, the house emerged from the fog.

It was old, its wooden walls gray and swollen with age. The porch sagged, the windows dark, empty eyes staring into the night. A weathered wind chime hung from the eaves, silent despite the breeze.

The old man pushed open the door. The hinges creaked like a wounded animal.

“Come in,” he said, stepping aside.

Everything in me screamed not to. But the cold was sinking into my bones, and I had no other choice.

I stepped inside.

The first night in that house was restless. My body ached from the crash, and every sound in the old wooden structure set my nerves on edge. The walls creaked, the wind howled through unseen cracks, and the heavy scent of cooked meat still lingered in the air.

I barely slept. When I finally drifted off, I had strange dreams—dark figures loomed over me, whispering in a language I didn’t understand. A sharp pain jolted me awake, and I found myself gripping my own arm, my nails digging into my skin like claws. My mouth was dry, my stomach twisting with an unfamiliar hunger.

The next morning, Mary greeted me with a wide smile, a steaming plate of eggs, thick slices of ham, and fresh bread already set on the table. "You need to eat," she said, her tone leaving no room for argument.

I hesitated. "I really appreciate everything you’ve done, but I should probably start figuring out how to get back to town. Maybe there’s a road nearby? A way I could walk?"

Henry chuckled, settling into his chair across from me. "Roads around here ain’t exactly… reliable. And you’re still in rough shape. Best to stay put until we can get you properly patched up."

Something in his voice made me pause. I glanced at Mary, but she was busy pouring coffee into a chipped ceramic mug, her expression unreadable.

I swallowed thickly and took a bite of the ham. It was rich, almost too rich, but I forced myself to chew and swallow. Mary and Henry exchanged a glance.

"Good, good," Mary murmured. "You need your strength."

I nodded, pretending not to notice the way their eyes lingered on me as I ate.

The day passed slowly. The house had no electricity, no phone, and according to Henry, the nearest town was "a good forty miles off, through thick forest and rough land." He offered to take a look at my car later, but his tone was casual—too casual. As if he already knew it wouldn’t be going anywhere.

I explored the house when they weren’t watching. The rooms were sparse but clean, the furniture handmade and sturdy. In the back room, I found something strange—hooks hanging from the ceiling, thick ropes coiled neatly beside them. A long wooden table sat in the center, deep grooves cut into its surface. My stomach twisted.

When I turned to leave, Henry was standing in the doorway.

"Looking for something?" His voice was light, but his eyes were sharp.

I forced a smile. "Just stretching my legs."

He nodded slowly. "Best not to wander too much. This house has a way of… keeping folks where they belong."

That night, I locked my bedroom door and wedged a chair under the handle. The hunger in my stomach grew worse, a gnawing emptiness I couldn’t explain. And as I lay in bed, listening to the distant sound of something heavy being dragged across the floor, I realized I might not be the one in control here.

I might already be trapped.

The morning air was thick with the scent of cooking meat again, but this time, it turned my stomach. I sat up, disoriented, my head pounding. My skin felt clammy, as if I had sweated through the night, but the air in the room was ice cold.

I got up and pressed my ear against the door. Silence. No movement, no voices. But something felt wrong. My mouth was dry, and my limbs ached, but not just from the accident—something deeper, as if my body was starting to betray me.

I hesitated before pulling the chair away from the door and slowly turning the knob. The hallway was empty, the wooden floor creaking under my steps. I moved cautiously, my bare feet light against the boards. As I neared the kitchen, the smell grew stronger, more pungent.

Mary stood at the stove, humming softly. A thick slab of meat sizzled in a cast-iron skillet. She turned as she heard me approach, her smile warm but her eyes cool. "Mornin’, dear. You slept in. That’s good, you need your rest."

I swallowed hard. "What time is it?"

"Oh, just past noon," she said, flipping the meat with a practiced hand. "You must’ve been exhausted. Your body needs time to heal."

My stomach twisted. Noon? I had never been a heavy sleeper, and I could swear I had only dozed off for a few hours.

Henry was nowhere to be seen. I shifted uneasily. "Where’s Henry?"

Mary stirred something into a pot, her movements slow, deliberate. "Tending to some things outside. Won’t be back for a bit. But don’t you worry, you’ve got me to keep you company."

A lump formed in my throat. I forced myself to nod and sat down at the table. A plate was already waiting for me. The same rich, glistening meat. The same thick bread. It looked… darker today. I poked at it with my fork, my stomach churning.

Mary sat across from me, resting her chin in her palm. "Go on, eat. You’re wasting away."

I cut a piece, my hand trembling slightly. I raised it to my mouth, but the moment it touched my tongue, a metallic taste spread across my palate. My teeth clamped down instinctively, and the texture was wrong—too dense, too fibrous. My throat tightened.

Mary watched me.

I chewed slowly, forcing myself to swallow. My insides recoiled.

"Good, good," she said, that same pleased murmur from before. "You're getting stronger already."

I pushed my plate away. "I— I think I need some air."

Mary’s smile faltered for just a fraction of a second, but then she nodded. "Of course, dear. Just don’t wander too far."

I stepped outside, my breath coming fast. The cool air hit me like a wave, and I leaned against the porch railing, trying to steady myself.

Something rustled near the tree line.

I squinted. A figure stood just beyond the clearing, half-hidden by the branches. My heart jumped into my throat. It wasn’t Henry. It wasn’t anyone I recognized.

It was watching me.

I took a slow step back, my pulse hammering. The figure tilted its head, just slightly, and then—

It was gone.

I stumbled backward into the house, slamming the door shut. Mary looked up from her cooking, unfazed. "Something wrong, dear?"

I shook my head, but the hairs on the back of my neck were still standing. "No. Just thought I saw something."

Mary smiled again, but this time, it didn’t reach her eyes. "Nothing out there but the woods, love. You’re safe in here."

Safe.

I swallowed the taste of iron still lingering in my mouth. I wasn’t so sure about that anymore.

I woke to the sound of soft murmurs just beyond my door. The voices were low, almost melodic, and I couldn’t make out the words. I held my breath, straining to listen, but the moment I shifted in bed, the murmurs stopped.

Silence.

Then—light footsteps retreating down the hall.

I stayed still for a long time, my pulse hammering in my ears. I knew I had locked the door. I knew I had wedged the chair under the handle. And yet, as I turned my head, I saw it—the chair was back where it had been before, neatly pushed under the desk.

My stomach turned violently.

I threw off the blanket and went straight to the door. Locked. Bolted from the inside. There was no way anyone could have come in. No way they could have left without me hearing them undoing the lock.

Unless they had never used the door.

A cold chill ran down my spine, and I stepped back from the door as if expecting it to swing open on its own. The air in the room felt heavy, thick with something I couldn’t name. My breath came faster, shallower. I needed to get out of there.

I crossed to the window, gripping the frame, ready to pry it open—but it didn’t budge. The old wood was warped, sealed shut by time and humidity. My fingers dug into the frame as panic started to build.

A knock at the door made me freeze.

"Breakfast is ready," Mary called softly. "Come on down now, dear."

Her voice was too sweet, too calm. Like she already knew I’d have no choice but to obey.

I swallowed hard, wiped my damp palms on my jeans, and forced myself to answer.

"I’ll be right there."

The floorboards creaked as she walked away.

I turned back to the window, staring out into the endless stretch of trees, the thick woods swallowing any sign of the outside world. The thought of walking through them, completely alone, terrified me almost as much as staying here.

Almost.

Still, I needed a plan. Because one way or another, I wasn’t going to let myself stay trapped.

Not until they decided I was ready.

Not until they decided I was ripe.

I forced myself downstairs, keeping my steps light, controlled. The kitchen smelled rich, heavy—like butter, sizzling fat, something seared to perfection. My stomach twisted, uncertain if it was hunger or nausea.

Mary turned as I entered, flashing that too-perfect smile. "There you are, sweetheart. You slept well, I hope?"

"Yeah," I lied, settling into the same chair as yesterday. Henry sat across from me, already chewing through a thick slice of meat. He met my gaze, chewing slowly, deliberately.

Mary set a plate in front of me—steak, eggs, roasted potatoes glistening with oil. The steak was thick, nearly bleeding at the center.

"Eat up," Henry said, voice low, expectant.

I picked up my fork. My fingers felt stiff, reluctant, like my body knew something I didn’t. The first bite hit my tongue—savory, iron-rich. My stomach clenched as I swallowed, the taste lingering.

It was too rich.

Too familiar.

My hands trembled. I glanced at Mary, but she was watching me, expectant. Henry, too. Like they were waiting for something.

I needed to get out of here.

I forced another bite down, then set my fork aside. "Henry, about my car—"

"Checked it this morning," he cut in. "Told you it was in bad shape."

I held his gaze. "How bad?"

Mary wiped her hands on her apron. "Oh, honey. Ain’t no fixing that thing. Best you stay here, let us take care of you."

The words twisted in my gut like spoiled food.

"I don’t want to impose," I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "Maybe I can hike out, find help—"

Mary clicked her tongue, shaking her head. "Oh, sweetheart, you wouldn’t last an hour out there."

Henry grunted in agreement. "Woods ain’t kind to folks who don’t belong."

Something about the way he said it made my skin crawl. I pushed my plate away, appetite gone. "I need some air," I muttered, standing.

Mary’s smile twitched. "Of course, dear."

I stepped onto the porch, inhaling deeply. The air was thick with the scent of trees, damp earth—something faintly metallic underneath it all. The woods stretched endlessly in every direction, no sign of roads, power lines, anything.

The house wasn’t just remote. It was hidden.

I took a careful step off the porch, then another. The grass was damp beneath my bare feet, the earth oddly soft. I moved slowly, testing them. They didn’t call out to stop me.

Not yet.

I reached the tree line, heart hammering. If I ran, if I just kept moving—

Then I saw it.

A clearing, just beyond the trees.

Clothes. Torn, dirt-streaked. A shoe. A dark stain in the grass.

A gut-wrenching realization settled over me.

I wasn’t the first person to end up here.

And if I didn’t figure out a way to escape, I wouldn’t be the last.

I took a step back, breath catching in my throat. The clearing before me wasn’t just a random patch of earth—it was a graveyard. A place where something, or someone, had been left to rot.

A twig snapped behind me.

I spun around.

Henry stood on the porch, watching. His face was blank, unreadable, but his hands were tucked deep into his pockets, shoulders relaxed. Like he already knew what I had seen. Like he was waiting for my reaction.

Mary stepped out beside him, wiping her hands on a stained cloth. "You’re wandering again, sweetheart."

Her voice was soft, almost scolding, like I was a child who had strayed too far.

I swallowed hard, trying to force down the panic rising in my chest. "I just… wanted some air."

Henry nodded slowly. "That’s understandable." He glanced past me, toward the clearing. "See anything interesting?"

I forced my face into something neutral. "Just trees."

A pause. A flicker of something in Henry’s expression—disappointment? Amusement?

"Good," he finally said. "Best to keep your eyes on what’s in front of you. Not what’s behind."

The words slithered down my spine like ice water.

Mary smiled. "Come inside, dear. Supper’s almost ready."

I hesitated.

Henry’s posture didn’t change, but the air around him did. It thickened, pressed in. The woods felt too quiet, too expectant.

I nodded. "Yeah. Sure."

They stepped back, letting me inside first. As I crossed the threshold, I felt it—like the house itself inhaled, pulling me in. The walls felt closer, the air heavier, thick with something more than just the smell of cooking meat.

The door shut behind me. The lock clicked.

I was running out of time.

I needed to find a way out.

Fast.

Dinner was already set when I walked into the kitchen. A steaming bowl of stew sat in the center of the table, the deep brown broth swirling with chunks of meat, thick-cut vegetables, and something else—something dark and stringy. The smell was intoxicating, rich, and savory. My stomach twisted in hunger.

"Sit," Mary said, already lowering herself into her chair.

Henry followed, slow and deliberate. His eyes never left me as I hesitated by the table.

"Go on," he said. "You’ve been looking a little thin."

A chill ran through me. My fingers curled against the back of the chair.

I needed to play this carefully. I forced a tired smile and sat down, reaching for the spoon. The first bite slid over my tongue, warm and fatty. My body reacted before my brain could, welcoming the food, the nourishment.

Mary beamed. "That’s a good boy."

I kept eating, slow and measured. Each bite was a battle—every muscle in my body screaming at me to stop, every ounce of instinct telling me that I shouldn’t be swallowing this, that it was wrong. But I had to keep them believing I was pliant, that I wasn’t thinking of running.

Henry finished his bowl before I did, pushing back from the table with a sigh. "You’re gonna sleep well tonight," he said. "Body’s working hard to heal. Needs the rest."

I nodded. "I appreciate everything. Really."

His eyes flickered with amusement. "We know, son. That’s why we’re taking such good care of you."

I forced another smile, then excused myself, saying I was exhausted. I didn’t look back as I walked down the hall to my room.

Once inside, I locked the door and shoved the chair beneath the handle. My stomach felt full, but the hunger hadn’t faded. If anything, it had deepened, turned into something else—something I didn’t understand.

I pressed a hand against my abdomen. My skin was warm. Hot, even. My head felt light, my limbs heavy.

Something was wrong.

I stumbled to the window, fumbling with the latch. It wouldn’t budge. My fingers were clumsy, uncoordinated.

Footsteps creaked outside my door.

A voice—low, knowing. Henry.

"Sleep tight," he murmured.

A shadow passed beneath the doorframe. Then silence.

I sank onto the bed, heart hammering. My vision swam, the edges of the room blurring.

Something was very, very wrong.

And I was running out of time.

The heat in my body only worsened. I lay on the bed, sweating through my clothes, my breath coming in slow, shallow gasps. My stomach churned—not in pain, but in some awful, insatiable need. The food had filled me, but it hadn’t satisfied me.

Something inside me was changing.

I pressed a trembling hand against my chest. My heart pounded, faster than it should. My skin felt tight, stretched too thin over my bones. My fingers twitched against the sheets, itching with a restless energy I didn’t understand.

I needed to get out of here.

I forced myself to sit up, dizziness washing over me. My limbs felt heavier, but I pushed through it. The room was suffocating, the air thick and humid. Every breath felt like I was inhaling something rotten, something spoiled.

The stew.

What the hell had they fed me?

I stumbled toward the window again, gripping the frame with clammy hands. The latch still wouldn’t budge. My fingers scraped against the wood, my nails digging in deeper than they should—deeper than was normal.

I yanked my hands back.

My nails had thickened, darkened.

I swallowed hard. My reflection in the glass was warped in the moonlight, but I swore my pupils were too wide, swallowing up too much of my eyes. My skin looked flushed, almost feverish.

Panic clawed up my throat.

I turned toward the door, my mind racing. I had to get out. I had to find a way to escape before—

A noise.

Not from the hallway.

From inside my room.

I froze.

Something shifted in the corner, a dark mass huddled near the floor. At first, I thought my fevered mind was playing tricks on me. But then it moved again, slow and deliberate.

Breathing.

Low, raspy.

I wasn’t alone.

I reached blindly for anything I could use as a weapon. My fingers closed around the metal lamp on the nightstand. I yanked it free, gripping it tight as I took a slow step forward.

"Who’s there?" My voice came out hoarse, strained.

The breathing stopped.

Then—

A whisper, soft as silk.

"You’re almost ready."

A jolt of terror shot through me.

I swung the lamp.

It passed through empty air.

The shadow was gone.

Only the whisper remained, curling around my skull, burrowing deep into my bones.

I was changing.

And I didn’t know if I could stop it.

I dropped the lamp, my hand trembling as I backed into the corner of the room. My pulse raced in my ears, drowning out all sound except the rush of blood through my veins. The whisper lingered in my mind, the words curling like smoke, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.

"You’re almost ready."

For what? What did that mean? I wanted to scream, to call for help, but my throat was dry, tight, as if something inside me had already begun to choke the life out of my voice.

The room felt colder now. The air thick, pressing down on me like a weight. I could hear my breath, shallow and uneven, as I fought to keep control. The walls felt like they were closing in, the edges of the room bending and warping as though reality itself was starting to splinter.

I glanced back at the window, but the reflection that stared back at me wasn’t mine. It was… wrong. The eyes in the glass were too wide, too dark. A twisted version of myself, staring back in silence.

A low chuckle echoed in the room.

I spun around, but there was no one there.

My heart thundered in my chest. I needed to get out of this place. I needed to escape, but every step I took toward the door felt heavier, more laborious. The hunger inside me pulsed like a heartbeat, an insistent throb that only grew worse the more I tried to ignore it.

The whisper came again, clearer this time. "You’re one of us now."

I gripped the doorknob, forcing it open, but the door wouldn’t budge. It was as if something on the other side was holding it shut, a force I couldn’t see but could feel, pressing against the wood, keeping me trapped inside.

I looked around the room in a panic. There had to be a way out. There had to be something I could do to get free.

My eyes landed on the table in the corner, the one with the deep grooves etched into its surface. My breath caught in my throat.

The hooks.

The ropes.

They hadn’t been there when I first explored the room, had they? Or had I just… ignored them?

I stepped toward the table, unable to look away from the crude implements. The air in the room seemed to thicken, pressing against my chest with a sickening heaviness.

I had to get out.

But where could I go? What was happening to me?

A sound behind me made me spin around.

It was Mary.

She stood in the doorway, her eyes wide, her lips curling into a smile that was far too sweet, far too unnatural.

"I told you," she said, her voice low and silky. "You’d be one of us soon enough."

I took a step back, fear rising in my chest, but something in her gaze stopped me. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, held me in place, like a predator luring its prey. My body trembled, and the hunger inside me—god, it was unbearable now—roared to life, deep in my gut.

I wanted to run. I wanted to scream.

But I couldn’t move.

"I’m sorry," Mary continued, her voice soothing, but her words only twisted deeper inside my mind. "You were always meant to be here. We’ve been waiting for you. For so long."

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. It was like her voice had wrapped around my brain, pulling me into some dark, suffocating place where escape wasn’t even possible. I wanted to scream. I needed to scream.

But I couldn’t.

"You’ll understand soon," she said. "You’ll understand what we are. What we do."

I tried to shake my head, tried to fight the pull of her words, but it was like they were sinking into my soul, rooting me to the spot. My body trembled, and I could feel the change, the shift in me, growing stronger, harder to resist.

The hunger. It was unbearable.

Mary stepped forward, her hand reaching out toward me. I flinched, instinctively stepping back, but the movement was too slow. Too late.

Her hand landed on my arm, and the heat that shot through my skin was unlike anything I’d ever felt. It was fire and ice, pain and pleasure, all tangled into one. I gasped, my breath hitching, but it didn’t matter. Her touch burned through me, through everything I was.

"Time to come home," she whispered.

Her grip tightened.

And I felt it. The change. It spread like wildfire, racing through my veins, crawling under my skin. My body, my soul, everything about me was shifting, turning into something else.

Something I couldn’t control.

And as Mary’s smile stretched wider, as her grip tightened further, I realized there was no escape. There had never been.

I was becoming part of this twisted thing.

Part of whatever they were.

And it was too late to turn back now.

The transformation didn’t happen all at once. It was slow, like a creeping vine, winding around my body and squeezing tighter with each passing second. The hunger, it gnawed at me from the inside, a constant presence now. Every movement felt unnatural, every breath too shallow.

Mary’s grip on my arm was still there, but it wasn’t the burning heat anymore. It had become something else. Something cold. It seeped into my skin, down into my bones, until I felt like I was nothing but a shell of who I used to be.

"You're one of us now," she whispered again, her voice low and hypnotic. She smiled, but it wasn’t comforting. It wasn’t kind. It was something else entirely. "You're not going anywhere. Not anymore."

I wanted to scream, to pull away, but my body felt alien to me now. I couldn’t move the way I used to. My legs felt stiff, my arms heavy. I tried to lift them, tried to break free of her grasp, but it was as if my body was no longer mine to control. My fingers curled involuntarily, pressing against the cold surface of the floor beneath me.

There was no escape. Not from the house, and not from whatever I was becoming.

I looked at her, tried to focus on her face, but everything seemed blurry now. My vision flickered, shifting in and out of focus. My thoughts were muddled, swirling in a fog I couldn’t clear. Was this what she meant? Was this the change she’d been talking about?

"You’ve been chosen," she continued, her tone almost gentle now, as if trying to soothe me. "We all were. You just didn’t know it yet."

Her words echoed in my head, repeating over and over, twisting around my mind until I could barely hear anything else. My mouth was dry, my heart pounding in my chest, but the pain—the hunger—it was worse than anything I’d ever felt.

“Chosen for what?” I managed to croak, my voice thin, almost foreign to my ears.

Mary’s smile deepened, and she leaned in closer, so close I could feel the warmth of her breath against my skin. "To be part of something bigger. We feed, we grow stronger. We… evolve."

Evolve? What was she talking about?

Something inside me screamed. I tried to resist, tried to hold on to the last shred of who I was, but it was slipping away. I could feel it—like sand sifting through my fingers.

“I… I don’t want this,” I whispered, barely recognizing my own voice.

Mary’s smile never wavered. She let go of my arm, but the coldness lingered, spreading through me like poison. "It doesn’t matter what you want. You’ll see. Soon enough."

I staggered back, my legs unsteady, but I didn’t fall. I didn’t collapse. I had to focus. I had to get out. There had to be some way out of this.

I took a few shaky steps, my body still stiff and unresponsive, but something pulled at me. Something in the house. It was like a presence, a dark weight pressing down on me, making it harder to think, to move. I was trapped. Trapped in my own body. Trapped in this place.

I glanced around the room, trying to find an exit. There had to be a door, a window, something. But the walls, they weren’t the same. The edges were soft, shifting, and the room—everything about it—felt warped.

"Where are you going?" Mary asked, her voice suddenly sharp, laced with something that made my skin crawl.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

I pushed forward, dragging my legs like they were made of lead. My breath was coming faster now, my heart pounding in my chest. But there was no escape. No way out. The house—it was alive, and I was becoming part of it. I was becoming part of whatever this was.

Suddenly, I heard footsteps behind me. Heavy, slow, deliberate. I didn’t turn around. I couldn’t. It was as if I already knew what was coming. I had known, deep down, all along.

The hunger.

The change.

It was all consuming.

I took another step, another, but the door was still too far. I wasn’t going to make it. I wasn’t strong enough.

A hand touched my shoulder.

I froze.

It wasn’t Mary this time. It was Henry. His face was too calm, too still, like he knew exactly what was happening, exactly what I was becoming.

"Don’t run," he said softly, his voice almost a whisper. "There’s no place to go."

I wanted to push him away. I wanted to scream, but the words wouldn’t come. My throat felt like it was closing up, suffocating me. His touch—it was cold, too cold.

I looked down at my hands, but they weren’t mine anymore. My fingers had elongated, the nails sharp and twisted, like claws. My skin, pale and bruised, stretched over bones that felt thinner, more fragile than they had ever been before.

I didn’t recognize the reflection in the window anymore. It wasn’t my face staring back at me. It was… it was something else. Something hollow. Something hungry.

I staggered back, my breath coming in ragged gasps. "What… what have you done to me?" I choked out, my voice breaking.

Mary stepped forward, her hands gentle on my shoulders. "We’ve made you one of us," she said softly. "You’re part of our family now. You’ll understand. You’ll feed. And then, when the time is right, you’ll grow just like we did."

I felt something inside me snap. I couldn’t take it anymore. The hunger inside me—the gnawing, terrible need—it was unbearable. I couldn’t fight it. I couldn’t run.

I wasn’t sure if I was screaming, or if the sound was coming from somewhere else entirely. But the last thing I saw before the world went black was Henry and Mary, standing together, watching me. Waiting for me.

And I knew, deep down, that I had already become something else. I had already become a part of them.

And there was no turning back now.

I don’t know how long I’ve been here. Time doesn’t matter anymore. It’s all a blur now—shadows and whispers, hunger and darkness. I’ve lost track of how many times I've given in. How many times I’ve fed.

It’s like waking up in a nightmare that never ends.

I should’ve seen it coming. I should’ve known when I first walked into that house—when I first smelled the meat on the air, when I first saw the hooks, the ropes. They were all signs. Signs I ignored, because I thought I was in control, thought I could escape.

But I was never meant to escape.

There’s no escape from this. No way to break free of what they’ve turned me into.

The hunger... it’s worse now. It doesn’t just gnaw at me anymore; it *devours* me. I can feel it in my chest, in my limbs, deep in my bones, as if every part of me is starved for something I can never get enough of.

It’s like a fire inside me, a wildfire that consumes everything in its path, but I can’t put it out. I can’t stop it.

I don’t know what I was before—what I *was*—but that’s all slipping away. Everything that made me human, everything that kept me tethered to the world outside, it’s gone. And in its place, there’s this… *thing*. This creature that doesn’t feel anything anymore. No warmth. No compassion. Just hunger.

The others, Henry and Mary—they watch me now. They watch me, but they never speak. They don’t need to. They know. They know what I’ve become. They know what I’ve done. I can feel their eyes on me when I feed. I can feel them waiting for me to take that final step. To finally, fully surrender to what I am.

They don’t care about the person I was. They never did. They only care about the monster I’ve become. A monster like them.

There are no mirrors here. No windows. No reflection to remind me of who I used to be. I only see the shadows. Only see the way my hands have changed—the claws, the pale skin, the hollow eyes. The way my hunger never stops. The way I’ve learned to feed without thought. Without remorse.

The worst part? I’m starting to forget.

I’m forgetting what it was like to be me.

But there’s one thing I know for certain, deep down—one truth that’s still clear in the haze of everything that’s happened.

I’ll never leave this place. Not alive. And not the way I was before.

I hear footsteps now. They’re familiar. Soft. Slow. Mary. She’s always there. Always watching.

She comes closer, her voice low, soft like the wind. "You’re ready," she says, and I feel the words settle deep inside me, like a mark, an irreversible change.

I don’t know what I’m ready for. But I know I can’t stop it. The hunger. The change. It’s already too far gone.

The house feels different now. Not just the walls, or the furniture, or the rooms. *I* feel different. I don’t even know if I’m still the same person who stumbled into this place, who crashed that car, who thought she could escape.

But I know one thing. I’m not scared anymore.

The fear is gone, replaced by something darker, something deeper. Something primal.

I turn to face Mary, and for the first time since I got here, I look at her, really look at her, and I see it—the hunger in her eyes, the same hunger that’s been gnawing at me. It’s in all of us now. It’s what we’ve become. What we always were meant to be.

Her smile is soft, but there’s something in it now, something that makes me feel... cold.

“It’s time,” she whispers, as though she’s been waiting for this moment.

The hunger surges through me again, stronger this time. I can feel it—like a call. The others are waiting. They always are.

And for the first time, I *understand*. I don’t fight it. I won’t.

I walk with her down the hall, past the tables, the hooks, the ropes. Down into the room where we do what we do best. Where we feed.

And as I sit down, as I begin, I don’t feel regret.

I don’t feel fear.

I feel hunger.

And I know, deep inside me, that I will never be the same again.

The room is colder now. The air is thick with anticipation, and the shadows seem to stretch longer with each passing second. Mary stands at the edge of the table, her face half-lit by the dim flicker of a single candle. Her smile is all too knowing, but there’s something else—something darker—behind her eyes. She knows what’s coming. She’s been waiting for this. And so have I.

The hunger is unbearable now. It's like a fire that’s spread through my chest, down into my stomach, through my veins. It burns with a need that nothing can satisfy. Not food. Not water. Only *this*.

I’m not just hungry anymore. I *crave* this. I need it. The blood. The meat. The taste of it all.

It’s no longer a choice. I don’t even want to fight it.

I look around the room, at the two figures bound to the chairs across from me. Henry and Mary. They’re both silent, staring at me with cold, unwavering eyes. They don’t speak. They don’t need to. They know what I’m about to do. They know what I’ve become.

And they *want* me to do it.

The chair creaks as I sit down at the table, a table that seems to stretch forever, as if it could hold an endless amount of meat, of *life* to consume. But there’s only one thing I need. Only one thing that will quiet the gnawing inside me.

I take a deep breath. My hands shake as I pick up the knife. It’s not a big knife, not like the ones I’ve seen on the hooks above, but it’s sharp, and it’ll do the job.

I look at Mary first. She’s the one who made this happen. The one who *invited* me into this hellhole. But her smile is soft, like she’s proud of me. Proud of what I’ve become.

She nods slowly.

“Do it,” she says, her voice barely a whisper. “You’re ready.”

And I am. Ready to feed.

I turn to Henry, who’s still watching me with those empty eyes. His jaw is clenched, and his body tenses as I approach, but he doesn’t struggle. He doesn’t try to run.

He knows, too.

I raise the knife.

His mouth opens, but no words come out. Only a low, guttural sound, something between a gasp and a sob, and then silence.

I don’t hesitate. I drive the knife into his chest, and the blood bursts forth in a hot, slick stream. The taste is instant, sharp, metallic. It fills my mouth, filling the ache that’s been in me for so long.

It’s warm. So warm.

I tear into him, tearing his flesh apart, chewing, swallowing. I can’t stop. I won’t stop. The hunger is too strong, too consuming. And when I finish with him, I don’t even feel full. I feel *empty*.

I don’t even remember how long it takes. Hours? Minutes? Time is meaningless here. There’s just the hunger, and the taste, and the madness that’s taking hold of me.

When it’s over, I look at Mary again. She’s still smiling, still standing there, but there’s something else in her eyes now. A flicker of something darker, something that wasn’t there before.

“You’re one of us now,” she says, her voice softer than it’s ever been. "You’ve become just like us. And there’s no turning back.”

I stand up, my legs unsteady, my body feeling like it’s made of lead. The blood coats my hands, my face, my clothes. But it doesn’t matter. None of it matters anymore. I’ve done what I was meant to do. I’ve fed.

But as I start to turn away, something catches my eye.

It’s not Henry. Not Mary.

It’s something in the corner of the room, something that wasn’t there before.

A window.

A small, cracked window, barely big enough for a person to fit through. But what catches my attention isn’t the window itself. It’s what’s on the other side.

A reflection. But it’s not my reflection. It’s... *someone else’s*.

The person in the reflection looks exactly like me, but their eyes are wide, frantic, and full of terror. They’re banging on the glass, as if trying to break through, but the window is sealed shut.

I blink. The reflection vanishes.

For a moment, I wonder if I’m imagining it. If it’s just the blood, the hunger, the madness that’s warped my mind. But then I see it again—just for a second. A face in the window, looking out from the other side, staring at me with wide, desperate eyes.

I stumble backward, my heart racing. What the hell is going on?

Mary steps forward, her footsteps almost silent, and places a hand on my shoulder.

“Don’t look at it,” she says softly. “You don’t need to worry about that. We’ve already chosen you.”

I turn to face her, but the reflection is still there, waiting, pressing against the glass, screaming. But I can’t hear the sound. The room is silent except for my own breathing.

Mary’s smile widens.

“You’ll understand soon enough.”

And as I stand there, staring at the face in the window, I feel something cold wrap around my chest. Something tightening, pulling me deeper into the darkness of this house. Into the hunger. Into this never-ending nightmare.

But before I can move, before I can scream, the door slams shut. And I’m left standing alone in the room with the blood on my hands, and the hunger…

I-

I am-

I am hungry.
