I like chatting online. I have more online friends than real life ones. I'm both an introvert and chronically ill, so I rarely leave the house. I sometimes start chatting to listen to people, I sometimes try networking. I want to be a great horror author one day. I regret being so eager to chat now.

I chat with a British dude living in the Netherlands with his partner. He's nice to talk to. I was checking Reddit to see if he had replied to any of my messages. He hadn't, so I went to check the paranormal subreddit. I scrolled down several banana lengths, and I found a new post. Not even half an hour old.

It was recruiting people to join a group. An organisation. I clicked on the link, and it led me to a strange site. It was well-designed, but very weird. I didn't meet their requirements to apply, and it gave me the impression of a scam. I thought they were posing as a European secret society, in a subreddit full of people they deemed impressionable, to scam people. Well aware of this, I looked for a way to contact them. They called themselves The Watchers or Les Veilleurs.

I found a form at the bottom of the landing page, and I wrote a snarky and mocking message. I accused them of using conspiracy theories to attract clicks. I made fun of them. I didn't expect any reply, but a few days later I checked my inbox. The header said, 'me, admin'. The person replied with their name, I can only give their last name. Dubois. He was friendly and addressed my questions. He spoke of seeing beyond illusions.

He said he had been ignorant when he was my age but soon learned that the world worked differently. He debunked all the conspiracy theories that my father had tried to force on me. He said that the truth was darker, as it did not fit models or paradigms.

We started corresponding back and forth. I found it interesting.

I looked and I couldn't find a trace of the group when I typed it into Google. The site didn't come up when I searched for it. I looked for the post on Reddit as well. There was no trace of them. I did find a connection to a chemical company called Dubois. It was rather ordinary, they were legitimate. They were headquartered in Belgium and were a rich family. They owned a chateau located in the Ardennes forest. There were no pictures of it online though and its Wikipedia article was a stub. I asked him about this; I am a sucker for history. What girl doesn't like a castle? He didn't reply. For a while.

I sent him two more emails. Nothing. I asked a few people online, most had no idea of what I was talking about. A Belgian man, living in England, spoke of horrible crimes being committed at their castle. Murders, sexual assault, torture, and witchcraft. He said that he had lost his sister to the cult.

He said that they liked to lure victims using job postings and suspected their post in the paranormal subreddit served the same purpose. He said they were too elitist to look for members among the common people. He told me that they had the police in their pocket, and to not bother. He said that its roots ran deep, that it had connections to a group of witches from the Victorian era.

I told my sister about it, as I tell her everything. She said it was likely a scam or something dangerous. I agreed. I forgot about the whole affair.

I was checking my inbox one day and I was excited because my strange connection had responded. I opened it and I was shocked. He sent a document with screenshots of my conversations with my Belgian friend. He said I knew too much, and that if I were more important, I would have been taken out already.

I took it as a compliment that my lack of importance and poverty had saved my skin. He threatened to kill me if I did more digging. He gave my exact address, my father's workplace's address, his number, my mother's number. He gave the address of my sister's high school, I had graduated three years earlier. My weak heart began beating very fast. I was beyond terrified. I would die for my family. If I led to their deaths, I would hate myself forever.

I sometimes like to watch news from other countries, I saw it on France 24, a Belgian man had been found dead in mysterious circumstances. I saw his name and I froze. It was the man I had corresponded with. I knew that I had to take the threats seriously. I got one more threatening email. He told me that I would end up like my friend. It was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. Be careful who you talk to online, I beg you.
