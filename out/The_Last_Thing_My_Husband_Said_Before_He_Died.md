Love at first sight. Cliché, corny… and exactly how I met my husband. The ballroom was buzzing with lights and laughter. My friends dragged me along to an event hosted by their work committee. I was young and preferred libraries and coffee shops. To say the least, I was out of my comfort zone. I sipped my drink and nodded through polite conversations with my friends’ coworkers. In all honesty, I was bored. Same chats, over and over. I sat in the corner, counting ceiling tiles.

Until I heard the DJ play Madonna on the loudspeakers. No one moved, danced, or nodded along. I glanced toward the dance floor. One man stood alone, dancing as if his life depended on it. I chuckled. Not a single care in the world—just displaying every emotion in his movements, all by himself—like he’d done it a hundred times before.

He paused for a second, our eyes met, and he smiled, pointing for me to come toward him. As our eyes locked, I knew I would love this person—as friend, foe, or lover. I stepped onto the empty dance floor. No words were needed as he gently took my hand and twirled me. Every step was precise, like he’d danced this exact routine countless times before.

We danced all night. Our eyes did all the talking. When the music finally stopped, our movements froze, locked in motion. Our eyes stayed locked on each other. I sighed. “That was quite fun while it lasted.”  
 He smirked. “I missed that feeling so much.”  
 “I’ve never felt that before,” I said. “We should do it again sometime. My name’s Beck.”  
 He took my hand. “I’m Ben, and I would love to.”

Little to say, we spent the next few weeks dancing at numerous clubs around the city. Eventually, our friendship brought us to places I loved—libraries, coffee shops, and the animal shelter where I volunteered. Ben was confident, curious, and so interested in everything about me. He loved me without saying it aloud. His love was contagious. I wanted to spend every waking moment with him.

After months, I craved more. One night, I asked if he’d want to go dancing again. He eagerly agreed. The night scene never felt familiar to me, but being there with Ben changed everything. In those huge crowds, it felt like it was just the two of us—dancing alone, just like the first time we met. The music boomed. Cheers erupted. But I stayed locked on Ben. In that moment, the music silenced. I leaned in closer. “I love you,” I whispered.

He felt it too. Tears dripped down his face. “I will always love you, forever and beyond.”  
 I kissed him for the first time. It felt familiar, just like everything between us. We shortly married after that. Family and friends disagreed with our haste, but we didn’t mind. In our world, it was just us—perfect and complete.

A few years passed. We had a small apartment in the city. That feeling he brought never faded. We always danced once a week, Friday nights, after work. It was our calm, our space. The apartment was quaint but filled with joy. We even adopted a couple of cats. Everything was ideal. Ben was smart, always a step ahead. He cherished every moment with me—the morning coffee, hugs on the subway, every day together.

Then, one night on our way home, we decided to stop by our local deli. Outside, Ben’s face shifted. Concern flickered across his features.  
 “Beck, why don’t we go home tonight?” he asked.  
 I shrugged. “It’ll only take a second. Come on.”

I grabbed his arm. He didn’t move at first. Then, slowly, almost mechanically, he followed me inside. I hurried to the counter to grab our drinks and snacks. Seconds later, a masked man burst in, brandishing a firearm. He screamed obscenities, pointing the gun at me. I froze, tears spilling down my face.

I glanced back at Ben. His hands were up, tears streaming down his face. “I love you, Beck,” he said calmly.

The man behind the counter froze, hands in the air. “Relax,” Ben said, stepping forward. “Just point the gun at me. Take what you need.”

The masked man scoffed, raising the gun to Ben’s head. “Alright. Do it.”

In a flash, Ben grabbed the man’s wrist, twisting the gun away from himself. “Run!” he yelled.

I did. I ran, my legs barely moving fast enough to escape. I dialed 911, trembling. Then three gunshots rang out. I dropped my phone as glass shattered. Panic surged through me, and I ran back inside.

The counter man was dead. Ben lay on the floor, two gunshot wounds in his stomach. Blood pooled around him. I fell to my knees, clutching his hand. Tears blurred my vision.

“It will be okay, Beck,” he muttered, stroking my face gently. “I promise.”

“No! I can’t lose you, Ben!” I sobbed.

He grinned weakly. “This is the worst part… every time I come back. Not because I die, but because I have to leave you.”

I shook my head, screaming. “No! Help is coming! Stay with me!”

He coughed, blood on his lips. He pulled me closer. Then he said, quietly but clearly:

“I’ve done this hundreds of times, and I never regret it. I love you.”

I whispered back, holding him tight, “We’ll dance again soon, my love.”

He died in my arms. That was years ago. His words still linger. I don’t feel sadness anymore. Just the memory of him—and the echo of Madonna playing, and the feeling that someday, somehow, we’ll dance again.
