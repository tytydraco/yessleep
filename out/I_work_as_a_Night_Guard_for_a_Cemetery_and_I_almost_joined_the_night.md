This is my third post about my job working as a Night Guard, if you haven't read it already you can find [Part 1 Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/hSFdNDWkep) and [Part 2 Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/6TWssPNDxw). Anyways enjoy.

The cemetery I work in is going to have some long needed renovations done throughout the grounds.

One of our former mayors recently passed and in his will a large sum of money was left for the cemetery. A large mausoleum is to be built near the the top of the hill by many of the older burial plots and the monument of the town founder. He is to be interned in the mausoleum and the displaced graves will be moved to a columbarium that is to be built behind it. I was able to get a peak at the designs and it looks like a fairly nice design with plenty of slopes and waterspouts to make cleaning up any unsightly residue off of it easier.

Our admin building is going to be renovated as well and we are even getting a ping pong table for the break room. There was also some discussion about removing the tree from just outside of the southeast corner of the cemetery but apparently a 307-year-old white oak won’t be cut down because it predates the entire state and has several legal protections preventing anyone from cutting it down.

During one of the many boring lectures I’ve had the misfortune of listening to from Professor Joel, that white oak actually owns not only itself but technically two-thirds of the entire cemetery. I always prefer when he just starts pointing to random things and telling me what it was first called.

Even so, a boring lecture from Professor Joel, a bawdy tale from Mrs. McCarthy, a sermon from Father Callahan, and even the vague warnings of impending doom from Mad Michael, which are always given at 4:44 am every Sunday, are all better than a day where I have to clean up a mess or tolerate a particularly agitated spirit.

When I was a boy we had a chocolate lab named Hershey that gave birth to a litter of 5 puppies. I fell in love with a little golden lab with a scruffy neck that I named Aslan. While my parents hadn’t known how many puppies Hershey was going to have they figured she would have at least five and had promised four away to various friends and family. They told me that I would be able to keep one of the puppies for myself but that I would have to be very responsible with the newborn.

With an 8-year-old’s most sincere promise I eagerly looked forward to the day I would have a puppy to raise up and be my best friend like Hershey had been for my mom for the last nine years. 

What I didn’t know at the time, but learned as I grew older, a lab having puppies at such a late stage was incredibly risky for both the mother and her pups. Aslan had been the runt of the litter but I saw so much of myself in him that I begged my parents to keep him. As his siblings were weaned and found their new forever homes I faithfully did whatever I could to be by Aslan’s side.

At 3 months old Aslan got really sick and there was nothing that could be done for him. Losing him had been the hardest thing I had experienced at the time and left a calloused scar over my ability to love another animal.

The night I learned of the upcoming renovations I came the closest I ever have to breaking and speaking during one of my night shifts.

It had been surprisingly calm throughout the night, a few noisy chatters, a couple howlers, and a brief proposition from a well endowed woman with no facial features besides a distorted smile full of rows and rows of rotten teeth when I heard an unfamiliar sound coming from down the western pathway.

The happy yowling from a puppy echoed in my ears. As I started down that way I saw him running towards me. Little Aslan was hopping from side to side as he saw me coming towards him. He wasn’t sick as the last time I had seen him, an image that had corrupted any memory I had of him. Tears began to well in my eyes as I dropped down to one knee with open arms as I was about to call out the name of the dog I had lost all those years ago.

Kyle jerked me back with a furious yank and clasped a hand around my mouth to stifle any sound that might escape. Anger carved in his face at my foolishness before he turned my head to look at the presence that I was about to let consume me.

Standing in the place of what I had thought was my dog was a collection of jagged hands and paws emerging from a soot-covered malformation of amber, wickered yew, opossum tails, fish gills, and three fox heads nipping at each other.

I turned away from the beast and hugged Kyle as tears streamed down and covered his shoulder. The silent moaning stifled as he patted my back. We returned to the pavilion where we saw Father Callahan and Mad Michael playing rock, paper, scissors. Michael saw us first and shook his head before wandering off. Father Callahan feigned condolences as his hand hovered over my shoulder in mimicry of compassion. As I wiped away the remaining tears I noticed in a fraction of a second an upturned smile on Father Callahan’s stoic face.

Maybe I was wrong about the spirits I thought had been accepting of their eternal waystation. I don’t think I’ll be playing chinese checkers with Callahan anytime soon.

The next day I was fortunate to have a day off and took full advantage for a moment of reprieve from my living nightmare the previous shift. I met up with Isaac, who was also off that night, and Eli for greasy burgers at our favorite diner. Isaac offered kind words as Kyle had called him earlier that day and Eli seemed genuinely surprised that I had seen my puppy from decades prior.

Neither had any explanation for why that thing had appeared as it had but confirmed that it would explain what happened to several former night guards that had been lost before I started working there.

Callahan was never brought up but I hope that the upcoming renovations disturbing the graves don’t allow for the spirits to become more crazed.

The work will all be done during the daytime for obvious reasons. There is no need to feed a few dozen contractors to the demons lurking in the cemetery.

I did notice something I hadn’t seen before in all of the years I’ve been working here. Near the duck pond in the western part of the cemetery I found the gravestone of D. L. Regent. He was a northern turncoat during the Civil War living in our town trying to thwart the efforts of runaway slaves that were sheltered on their travels up to Canada. When the town learned of his duplicitous nature he was forced to run over hot coals before being hung from the white oak tree just outside the cemetery.

We even have a creepy little nursery rhyme said about him in elementary schools.

“Run, Run Regent as fast as you can. The rope is readied by the Righteous Hangman”

In the cemetery, every third Thursday of the month, you can see a man with bloodshot eyes, a rope around his neck with self-inflicted scratches at his throat running through the forest. Behind every step he takes you can see the burning flesh footprints left behind until the charcoaled remains burn smolder away. 

I don’t know why he would have been buried in the cemetery. The rest of The Regents have a familial mausoleum and had been very vocal about their disgust in his behavior following the end of the war. 

I might have to take a stroll through the cemetery during the daytime to see if I can find any other graves of the spirits I have encountered during my nightly watch.
