 I lived on an island south-west of Canada and north-west of the USA. Both of the countries hadn’t claimed the island, so we just called it “USC” (United States of Canada). Very creative name, I know.

We celebrated different holidays very differently: one of the main holidays being Halloween. 

We started at 11 PM, when we chucked candies out of the window and onto the streets. Then, we hid. When it struck midnight, the Day of the Arcane begun. 

For 24 hours, we have to hide. Otherwise the Arcane would come for us. 

The Arcane had a skull like a wolf, covered in flesh. It had no eyes and //its mouth had some sharp teeth. It’s body was just a ribcage and it had red stuff around it. It’s legs were thin and had three, big claws. Once again, it was covered in flesh. It had tan, red and white stubs instead of legs. 

This story happened on Halloween 2013. I was 21 and had 2 children. My wife was 20 years old (we went to the same school). We chucked the candy out of the window as usual and went outside and into the bunker. We set up 4 sleeping bags and my two kids went to sleep.

I got out my flashlight and got out of the bunker.

*Were the doors locked?*

I went to look. They had to be. I looked at the clock. ***11:51.*** Huh.

I ran to the front door, and checked if it was locked. It was unlocked. I then locked it and went to the window. Curiosity peaked. I checked the clock. ***11:56.*** I did want to see it for myself - so I looked out of the window.

I ducked.

The Arcane was there. I crawled onto the floor and into the kitchen. As quietly as I could, I opened the backyard window and closed it. I opened the lock on the bunker, got in, and closed it. I checked the clock on the wall. ***00:01.*** 23 hours and 59 minutes left. 

Let me tell you more about the Day of the Arcane. At least one person had to make a blood sacrifice, otherwise the Arcane would be “unsatisfied”. If it was unsatisfied, it would go on a rampage for 30 minutes after the day ended, destroying everything in it’s path. Including the bunkers.

Nobody knows where the Arcane came from. There are quite a few conspiracy theories, one of the most popular being that the Arcane swam from the coast of the USA or Canada and swam here. Apparently the Arcane is a female.

It might lay eggs.

Inside of the bunker, I heard claws scratching. Did I forget my cat? My heart lurched. I checked through the peephole inside of the bunker. My cat. I opened the door. The Arcane was behind my cat. I dragged her inside and closed the door. I then locked it.

Bigger claws scratched and scratched and scratched. 

***BANG!*** 

Now, let me tell you about the bunkers. There is one pipe that connects to the rest of the bunkers, just in case the Arcane breaks in. It is just big enough for a human but smaller than an Arcane.

I grabbed the two children, and told my wife to get into the pipe.

***CRAA-AASH!***

I got into the pipe and crawled in. I twisted myself into a position where I could look at the Arcane. However, my cat was in the way.

“C’mon, Lee…”

I crawled into my neighbour’s bunker. They all had the same distressed look. They knew it came. 

“So, er… it is inside your bunker, yes?”

I checked the clock in my neighbour’s house. ***6:02.*** 

After about a couple of hours, it was 1 hour but it didn’t feel that long, I heard bangs and bongs coming from the pipes. I looked behind me. The Arcane was there. I grabbed my wife and two children and climbed up the ladder, opened the door and ran out. I didn’t think about the neighbours. The screams still haunt me. 

The sun was rising from the horizon and I ran out of the house. The door was locked. I climbed over the fence and went to the beach (our houses were seaside homes). I leaned against the stairs. 

In the distance, the Arcane came out and into the next home. 

I put my two kids on the ground and let go of my wife’s hand. I pulled out my hand gun and went in 144 Anios Street. However, I couldn’t be more prepared for what I saw..

The Arcane was nesting. Just like the conspiracy theory.

I shot the two eggs. I am pretty sure only one of them died. The other was alive…

It seemed like the mother died.

It’s been 10 years. The baby Arcane ran. Who knows when it’ll come back?
