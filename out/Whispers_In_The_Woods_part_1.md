Whispers In The Woods part 1




All I could hear were my ragged breaths and the roar of the wind in my ears as I climbed up a steep trail on Pont Pike. I wasn't sure how long I had been walking, my legs were screaming in agony but still, I pushed onwards. The sun was slowly starting to dip from the sky and I only had a couple hours at most to set up camp before I would be surrounded in the darkness of the woods. Around me was a thick canopy of towering trees swaying back and forth as the wind grew stronger with every passing moment. Of course, the weatherman was wrong once again. An entire week of what was supposed to be clear skies had quickly turned to dark skies that thundered above me. Any moment it looked like the sky could begin its relentless downpour, and I was nowhere near the campsite. As lightning flashed above me I knew there was no way around it, my lovely camping trip was about to become very wet and cold.
	
This trip hadn't even been my idea, my sister begged me to go on this weekend camping getaway. As children, we had gone on them many times with our parents and friends, but it had been quite some time since then. She called me almost daily trying to set up what was supposed to be some grandeur bonding trip to rekindle our old sisterly ways. After four days of calls, I relented and agreed. I talked to my boss, who was willing to give me a few extra days off work, bought the gear we needed for the trip, and then the day of the trip while I was in the car heading to our meet-up spot, she called.
	
"Hey Nighla, I'm so sorry."

You've got to be fucking kidding!

"Jeremy came down with the flu, and Mike is working overtime at the factory this week…" she paused, waiting for a response that wouldn't come. "I know it's really last second, I called as soon as I knew, but I've got to watch over him. Any chance we could reschedule next week?"
I swallowed down the hot lump of anger sitting in my throat. I knew it wasn't her fault and that obviously, she needed to take care of her son, but I couldn't help it. I had spent almost $300 in camping gear for us and was already two hours into the three-hour drive to get to the Pont Pike trail. There was no turning back for me. "Yeah, that's okay Cass. I don't know when I'll be able to take off work again, but we can reschedule another time. Tell Jeremy I said to get better, or I won't bring him any more of those Drumstick desserts he loves so much.
It got a small laugh out of her before the line went silent once again. "Thank you…"
	
The line went dead. 

Cass hated good-bye's, never would she say it after leaving from a long visit or getting off the phone. It was a large part that caused a strain in our relationship. One week everything is great and then the next she's moving off with her boyfriend and she couldn't even tell me. It was as if she'd just up and vanished from my life like I meant nothing. Now she wanted to reconnect. I thought I'd be happy, I had missed her so much, but for some reason, it pissed me off more that she wanted back in. I just wish I knew why.

It might not sound like the smartest idea but it was because of this that I decided to go on with the camping trip alone. It wasn't my first time camping and I figured I could survive a couple days alone. I just needed this time to clear my head of the dusty fog that suffocated my mind. At first, it was great. I arrived at the trail entrance, took what I needed from the car, and hastily began my way up the trail. As I walked I could feel the sun's warm kiss on my back and in front of me lay a dense thicket of large oak trees, the dark green leaves on the branches blowing off as the trees swayed with the wind. The trail was slightly overgrown as I fought through thorny brambles and thick bushes, but the sights were worth it and I  felt that this trip would be a great time for me.

Fast forward to what felt like days. I was no longer feeling this sentiment. My body screamed at me and with every step I took I could feel my legs buckling beneath me. My phone had died and I hadn't thought to bring a watch so I couldn't be sure what time it was, but it was beginning to darken and I figured the faster I set up camp the better. I brought a portable charger, but with the skies as dreary as they were I was afraid to ruin any electronics, so as long as I could see it would stay tucked away in my pack. I walked and walked my mind turning blank pages as I went. I couldn't enjoy any of the sights offered by the tail anymore, all I wanted was to set up shop and drop dead till morning. 

Above me thunder clapped and a large strike of lightning flashed, bringing with it tiny droplets of rain. It started as slow little annoying pellets splashing in my face but in a matter of minutes, I was being soaked by a torrential downpour. I fought the rain in my eyes, wiping my eyes every couple of seconds and I shivered uncontrollably as my cold wet clothes latched onto my skin. The skies were almost black and any light that was left was mostly gone as the rain clouded my vision ahead, but still, I walked on. It was too late to turn back now. 

My thighs were beginning to chafe as my clothes rubbed against the insides of my legs, and just as I was about to give up any hopes of making it to this campsite I spotted a clearing ahead. I pushed aside large overgrown tree branches and walked into the clearing. It was just a large patch of ground free of trees, it looked as if I were in the eye of a tornado surrounded by trees on all sides. It was so hard to see I couldn't even make out the continuation of the trail but that was something to worry myself with later.

Much of the ground was soft and wet, puddles building up as the rain continued its onslaught. I was able to find a somewhat usable patch and quickly made base, pulling out the components of the tent and throwing it together as fast as possible. With the tent up I stripped off my wet clothes and threw them off to the side of my camp. They were soaked and the less wet items to bring inside with me the better. Normally I wouldn't find myself stripping nude even in the wild, but as I seemed to be the only one out here I couldn't stand to wear those freezing wet clothes another second. I entered the tent zipping it up behind me and pulled out more things from my pack. A small rag to dry off with, a change of clothes, and a soft cozy sleeping bag. Quickly I dried off and changed fighting the shivers that racked my body as I attempted to pull dry sweats up my legs. I had successfully changed but I was still freezing cold, but I knew from the pitter-patter of rain on my tent that there would be no fire tonight. So, I jumped into my sleeping bag and began vigorously rubbing my arms and legs in an attempt to warm my body. 

Slowly I felt my body warming and as I did I could feel the exhaustion seep into my bones, tugging at my eyes and whispering sweet lullabies in my ear.  I mustered up enough energy to pull the portable charger from my bag and plug my phone in but as my head hit the sleeping back once again I was pulled right into a weary slumber. 

My eyes shot open to be met by complete darkness. I wasn't sure what had woken me, hell I wasn't even sure I was actually awake as my mind fought to regain its proper functions, but as I lay there looking around the inside of my tent I heard it.

CRUNCH!

My body shot upright and I strained my ears to listen harder. I could hear the growing thump in my chest as I struggled to listen to the noises outside the tent. The rain must have stopped as I could no longer hear any water droplets smacking the top of the tent. In fact, I couldn't hear anything. The woods had gone deathly silent, except for the consistent crunch of dead leaves circling my tent. I wanted to move to grab the knife from my pack but my body wouldn't budge, I couldn't move. I just sat petrified listening to the footsteps circling me. I tried to rationalize to myself that it was just an animal but this was different. It didn't sound like some four-legged creature scuffling about. This was a walking stride, heavy footsteps canvasing my tent. It was deliberate. Then after what felt like hours it stopped, and that's when the whispers began. 

They were soft, almost inaudible but I could make it out just barely. What was worse was that it seemed to be coming from all around me, it wasn't like the footsteps where I could pinpoint an exact location, this was coming from all sides. I shook the ice from my bones and slowly moved out of the sleeping bag towards my pack. I moved inch by inch horrified at any sound the tent made with my tiny footsteps. My heart threatened to beat out of my chest. I cringed as I unzipped my pack, muting the sound of the zipper the best that I could, and grabbed the knife inside. The whispers were growing louder but I still couldn't make out any words. I flicked open the knife muffling as best I could but still a soft click sounded, and the whispers stopped.

I sat still horrified to move an inch and then it spoke.

"N-Nighla… help me!"

What the fuck?

I inched forward for the tent zipper then stopped. Why would Cass be out here? She would have had to hike through the rain in pitch-black darkness, and she wouldn't have walked around the tent in the dead of night, not even if she really wanted to scare me. 

"Help me please!" the voice screamed.

It shook me to my core. It sounded almost identical to my sister but the voice was distorted, almost as if it were coming from a speaker. It was horrific. It sounded like she was being torn apart, screams of agony filled the night, but still, something wasn't right. It couldn't be Cass. I scrambled inside the tent searching the floor for my phone and found it. I had to wait for it to power up but as I did the light illuminated from my phone lit up the tent. The screams immediately stopped. Listening intently I heard it again, the crunching of leaves. 

Footsteps heading straight for me.
