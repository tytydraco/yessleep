*THURSDAY*

Today is the day our truck delivers. We only get an order in once a week, so it's usually a lot. Takes a full crew to get it unloaded and processed, so all of us weekday stockers are required to be here. No exceptions. It gets a little chaotic, but I don't mind it too much. Makes the time go by faster. 

By the time I get here, they're usually more than halfway through it all. But today, truck got here late... so looks like I'll be busy until close. Fine with me, I drank an extra cup of coffee this morning, so I'm ready. It's strange, I'm actually in a pretty good mood today; almost excited to go to work. 

I clock in and join the rest of the crew in the warehouse. The openers are hard at work unloading and sorting all the merchandise. Jaden and Janie are the ones in charge of them all. We call them The Bitch Twins. Any other day, they could give a shit less about what's going on around here. But on truck day, they'll bite your head off if you don't move fast enough.

Luckily, the products start off normal when they  come in. They only start acting weird once they've been here a couple hours, so we try to get everything on the shelf as fast as we can. We start with the dairy and frozen items, since they need to be stocked first. I'd already noticed Yogurt Lady waiting by the coolers for a fresh batch, so I loaded Emma's cart up with everything that gets stocked in that area. Good luck to both of them. 

I step over Headless Elroy wiggling around on the floor, and grab my cart. This happens to him every Thursday; old man just cant keep up the pace, and The Bitch Twins show no mercy. His head usually re-spawns by the end of the night though, so it's no big deal. 

"Move it, Elroy." I say, kicking his shoulder as I pass. He just starts flailing around even more, so I scoot him over to the side with my foot. 

I took the milk, Chris took the eggs, and Paul got stuck with all the freezer items. He was pissed, of course, but I don't give a shit. The only reason the freezer is so hard to stock is because he'd been using it as a body storage, until it got too full. He made that mess, he can fucking deal with it.

Once I finish putting away everything on my cart, I look over to Chris to see if he needs any help with his. He does. He's covered in egg juice, fighting with his extra hand trying to get the carton away from it. I walk up to him, and ask,

"Need a hand?"

He doesn't laugh, he just glares at me in defeat. I turn around, bend over, and the hand drops the carton. 

"Hey, thanks man!!" Chris says.

Usually I'd clean up this mess myself, but I'm just too busy today. I walk past Emma snacking on a yogurt covered finger, and go over to the wall phone to page Lenny for a clean up. When I put the receiver to my ear, it licks me. Disgusting, I know. But, a phone tongue is better than the last thing it shoved into my ear. 

Lenny takes over 10 minutes to show up with the mop and bucket. By then, the floor is covered with raw egg/yogurt soup, and the Turd Slug is lapping it up. I tell Lenny just to stand there and wait till it's finished. We don't need any bigger of a mess. Speaking of, I should probably go check on Paul in the freezers. *Eh,* maybe later. 

One of the openers must have been shoved outside before 8:00, because I noticed there's one less here than usual. Every so often, the openers get together and choose one unfortunate soul amongst them to sacrifice to The Earlybirds. The openers say it keeps them from ever actually coming inside, but I think they're all just sadistic. Or bored. Thank God they're all about to leave. 

Duffle Bag Man just shuffled in. You'd think he brings that bag in here to shoplift, but it's the opposite. The bag is full when he comes in here, and empty when he leaves. I have no clue what the fucker is bringing here, but whatever it is, it *can't* be good. I'm sure I'll find out... eventually. 

The Hum seems like it's getting quieter, because I can barely hear it tonight. We only have a few carts left to put out, so I leave them to it and head toward the break room with my brown paper bag. I get in there, and Lenny's dripping all over the sandwich he's eating. When he sees me, he stops chewing.

"Don't be mad..." He says.  

I already know. I reach into my bag, and pull out a handful of sardines. 

"God damnit, Lenny!"

I come back from break, and of course, it's a fucking zoo out there. There's a herd of goats trying to get the Turd Slug, something pink is oozing from the ceiling, Chris is wrestling with his hand who's assaulting a customer, Paul is nowhere to be seen, of course, and all the fingers on Headless Elroy's right hand had been chewed down to nubs. He's gonna be so pissed when his head re-spawns. Oh, and the fucking carts didn't get finished. 

I chase the goats outside, stick a bucket under the drip, fill out the accident report for Chris' molested customer, finish stocking the spiders, then go looking for Paul. I found him in the freezer; he'd tripped over one of the bodies and knocked himself unconscious. Fucking idiot. I drag him out and leave him in the warehouse to thaw out for the night, then throw the rest of the empty boxes in the bailer. 

Tilly and Adam were both working tonight, so God knows what kind of biohazard I'm about to walk up to in the front. I pass down aisle 13 on the way. The Spill That Never Dries is growing.  It's eaten the wet floor sign that was next to it; just as I suspected. I put out a new sign, even though it won't last long, then call it a day. 

When I get to the front, I ignore the various smells coming from the register area, then approach the time clock carefully. No Turd Slug, no Fart Cloud, the coast is clear. I punch my number in, and the time clock hadn't stolen any of my time today. I smile triumphantly, turn around, and Paul is standing behind me; shivering and clutching an icicle. He stabs me in the arm with it and tells me I'm a douche bag. I sigh. Maybe I'll call in [tomorrow](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/kOjXKFdXzf).
