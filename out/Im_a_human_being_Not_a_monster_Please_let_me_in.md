My parents have always said "family is the most important thing". So when we got news that my Grandma (Lola) died, we had to drop everything and fly to Capiz to attend the funeral. 

Capiz is about an hour flight away from Manila. Even though it was my Dad and Grandparent's hometown, I've never been there before. All I know is it is called the "Aswang capital of the Philippines". 

"Aswang" is a blanket term for supernatural beings that eat human flesh and/or drink blood.

I've lived in Manila my entire life. As a rational city boy, the thought of flesh eating monsters existing is ridiculous. 

The flight was pretty uneventful. We were picked up by Lolo (grandpa) in his silver SUV. Just me, Dad and Mom. 

We arrived at Lolo's house. It is this beautiful two story house surrounded by trees and a backwoods area. 

Lolo: "Mark, we're going to buy some supplies for the funeral" 

Me: "Can I stay here? I'm still pretty tired from the flight. I want to take a nap" I replied.

Lolo: " But you'll be here all alone. We won't be home until after dark"

Me: "I'll be fine"

Lolo: "Alright. Lock the doors. Remember what I told you about Tao Po. Don't let anybody in the house"

Me: "Yup I won't".

A common phrase in the Philippines when knocking on someone's door is to say "Tao po" which roughly translates to "person here". 

Lolo said that the original phrase is "Tao po, hindi Aswang" which means "Person here, not an Aswang". Apparently it comes from the belief that Aswangs has a hard time copying human speech. Another silly rural superstition. 

I took a nap. Must have been more tired than I thought. I slept all afternoon and the sun is starting to set. They're not home yet. 

Looked for food downstairs then I heard a knock.

"Who is it" I shouted 

No answer. 

"Dad is that you? Are you guys back?" 

No answer. 

Checked the window. There was nobody at the door.

Checked my phone. 1 message. Received 5 minutes ago:

"Mark, we'll be home a bit late. There's some food in the fridge- Dad".

Ok I'm getting freaked out now. Maybe it was just hunger and I'm starting to hear things. Gotta eat something. 

Another knock. Somebody is definitely at the door.

"Dad? Lolo? Is that you?"

No answer. 

A cold chill went through my spine. Ther closest neighbor is miles away. 

Tried to call Dad. Number is busy. 

Then out of nowhere, another knock. This was much louder and more violent than the previous ones.

"Who is it? Please..." I said on the verge of tears. 

No answer. 

Went back upstairs at the guest bedroom. Locked the door. 

And then like a train it hit me. Someone was sitting on the bed. 

An old lady who looked familiar. But there's something off. As I looked a bit longer, I noticed her eyes were a bit too large, almost cartoon like. Her mouth was slightly off to the left. Ears were too close to her chin. 

With the sudden realization, I asked her softly: "Lola?...."

She looked at me. With a slight grin showing her teeth, I knew that this wasn't her. No human has teeth like that.

My Lola was dead. It wasn't even a person. 

It spoke. In a barely understandable voice that resembles nails scratching a blackboard...

Aswang: "Mark, you forgot to close the back door"
