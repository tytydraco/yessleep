I really don’t think that there’s any job more emblematic of how fucked up our society has become (sexually speaking) than the one I had. An OnlyFans chatter. I mean… really. My job was to sext strangers who thought I was their favorite OnlyFans model. Some days, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was part of some sort of scam, but no. As far as I knew, the company I worked for was completely legitimate and everything I did was, (again, as far as I could tell) completely legal. Dystopian as fuck. *But legal*!

&#x200B;

I guess my workday wasn’t that rough, all things considered. It wasn’t as easy as it probably sounds on paper since there were certain quotas we needed to meet and all that jazz, but I got to work from home, often lying comfortably in my bed and I could even work from my phone if required. All conversations were limited to a third party application we were using, so it supposedly would’ve been extremely difficult for any of the people I was talking to to get my personal information. 

&#x200B;

Really, when you broke it down, what I was doing wasn’t functionally all that different from online customer support. Only instead of helping a dissatisfied customer process their refund, I was helping some creeps with no social life jerk off and rating dick pics. (My ratings were always based on how much of a creep they were, not on the actual size of the penis in question.)

&#x200B;

I also wasn’t just dealing with the customers of just *one* model. No, by the time I quit I was sexting the clients of about 64 different models with several of them being either male or trans (I am neither) and I’d like to think that I was pretty good at it. There's a certain level of skill to being a Chatter. You can't just say anything to anyone. When you're chatting for a model, you've got to be able to impersonate them. You need to be able to copy their typing style and the little quirks they might have when texting. You need to know the little personal details they might have shared, or at least the details of the online persona they've created for themselves. 

&#x200B;

Beyond that - you need to present yourself in a way that's going to play into the fantasy of the people texting that model while also staying *‘On Brand’* as it were, and promoting additional content, dragging them deeper into the financial rabbit hole of a parasocial relationship. If a subscriber is texting Aria, an upbeat travel junkie whose content consists of 90% beach nudes about how much he hates his job at some factory, then Aria needs to direct the conversation away from his misery and toward how much she'd love to take him to her favorite lagoon on the beach for a romantic evening under the stars… and maybe suck his dick. Likewise, Cleo the financial dominatrix isn't going to have a lot of sympathy for people's sad stories about their shitty lives and will be a lot colder to her subscribers. 

&#x200B;

Every Model I worked with had a drastically different persona and I had to know them all. It actually kinda reminded me of my old Online RP days, which had once upon a time been my go to escape from the mundanity of day to day life. Only this was *mostly* smut as opposed to those old plot driven RPs with only occasional smut in them, and I was getting *paid* to do it. Not that the pay was particularly great… mind you.

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, it *was* still paying the rent and I needed that. It's just that I would have preferred something a little less… well… *dystopian.* Still, I needed to take what I could get. Not a lot of places are particularly keen on hiring someone in a wheelchair. Sure, they *say* they’ll make accommodations, but most places really don’t mean it, so I had to take what I could get. Getting a job as an OnlyFans chatter isn’t necessarily easy either. A lot of agencies hire their chatters from poorer countries (because of course they do), and even without that part of Capitalism making it harder to find a job, I still had to jump through a lot of hoops and work with a lot of shadier agencies to get hired by the one I ended up working for near the end. 

&#x200B;

I won’t give out their name, but they were one of the agencies that worked with the more prestigious models… and yes, I did chat for some of said prestigious models, although never for any of the really big names. I think the biggest model I worked with was Lillie, a girl who mostly filmed herself out dogging, engaging in public hookups with *‘strangers’* (who were probably all pre-vetted and hand picked to avoid any unnecessary risks).

&#x200B;

Honestly, despite the type of content the Models I chatted for produced, a lot of the back and forth messages were relatively mundane. Some of them were comments on videos or photo sets that my models had shot that were fairly tame.

*“Hey Andie, just wanted to say that the bathtub video of you was really hot. <3.”*

&#x200B;

Call me strange if you want, but I always found those comments kinda wholesome. Or at least as wholesome as you can get, when reaching out to someone about a video of them masturbating in the bathtub.

&#x200B;

I’d usually reply to them with a friendly, but generic response. Stuff like:

*“Aww, I’m so glad you enjoyed it!”* Before trying to upsell them on another video, or another tier of the subscription. A lot of the time, whoever was on the other side of the messages ate it right up.

&#x200B;

Then there were the cosplay requests, which were always popular with some of my female models. I usually forwarded those directly to the actual clients. A number of the popular requests even ended up as videos or photoshoots.

&#x200B;

Most depressing were the day to day DMs from lonely hearts who craved some kind of connection and had unfortunately chosen *FemboyFeet19* as the one to bare their soul too.

&#x200B;

I always felt a little bad for those people. Most of them did seem genuinely nice, and I couldn’t help but feel a little bit guilty knowing that the model they thought they were building a parasocial relationship with didn’t even know they existed. A lot of those chats did involve sexting, and I always felt a little guilty with those, knowing that I was playing these miserable people like a fiddle just to milk a few hundred extra dollars out of their wallets.

&#x200B;

We were encouraged to mostly message the ones who paid. The *‘Ballers’* as some called them. The ones who didn’t pay - *‘Brokies’* got less attention and fewer messages. I always felt even worse for them, because they were usually just as obsessed with the models as the guys who had money… although I never felt bad enough to give them any extra time.

&#x200B;

Of course - among those lonely hearts were the really fucked up ones. The ones who’d just up and send the most mindlessly lust fueled messages out of the blue, usually sharing whatever fantasy they’d had about that particular model. Some were pathetically mundane things like:

*“I want to tie you up and fuck you until you scream for Daddys cum.”*

&#x200B;

But the best ones were completely off the fucking wall.

&#x200B;

For example: one of my models, a queer camboy by the name of Luca, got a message from a man telling him he wanted to: *“Cum in his Boipussy and make him Boipregnant.”*

&#x200B;

You really can’t make this stuff up…

&#x200B;

Another time, I got a message for a different model (A trans girl by the name of Emily) about how badly the sender wanted her to fart in his mouth. I absolutely started howling with laughter when I read that one wondering what kind of man would type that out, read it back and go: *“Yes. This is what I want to send to the stranger that I pay to masturbate to!”*

&#x200B;

It wasn’t just men who sent weird messages either. I got more than a few weird messages from some particularly interesting ladies too. One of them sent a PM to one of my Male Models (a hunky country boy by the name of Danny) about how she wanted him to: *“Spank my clit until I cum to death!”*

&#x200B;

At no point in my life have I ever read anything less erotic… but it was still pretty funny to imagine someone typing that out in a fit of passion, and even funnier to imagine Hunky Country Boy Danny actually *reading* something like that, considering 85% of his videos were him and his Hunky Country Twink Boyfriend Austin fucking the shit out of each other.

&#x200B;

Yeah… those bizarre messages always made my day… unlike the ones I sometimes saw from the more unhinged fans. The ones who seemed convinced that whatever Model they were talking to was either *genuinely* in love with them, or would fall in love with them if they just gave a creep with stars in his eyes and more money than social skills a chance. Those messages tended to be disturbing on a lot of different levels.

&#x200B;

*“Riley. I have done so much for you! I have supported your every video, I have joined your Platinum Tier! I am your top subscriber! I have stood by and tolerated your career even though you have debased the temple that is your body with the cocks of countless other men! I only ask that you please meet with me, so I can show you my love is genuine!”*

&#x200B;

Stuff like that, which was probably intended as a desperate plea for the love of a porn star who *brazenly* marketed herself as a financial dominatrix (which I really just don’t get the appeal of), but came off as one of the final messages said Porn Star would read before she was pulled into the back of a windowless van and never heard from again.

&#x200B;

Those messages I just straight up didn’t reply to. When someone got too creepy, I just stopped talking to them. Sometimes they’d pop up again with an alternative account, but that wasn’t anything that ignoring them further couldn’t fix. Sooner or later they usually got the message, and I don’t think their beloved Models missed them all that much.

&#x200B;

My point behind this entire tangent is - I dealt with all sorts while doing this job, from the mundane to the creepy. After two and a half years of working with a rotating list of clients, I was pretty sure there wasn’t much anyone could send me that would surprise me.

&#x200B;

Do I need to tell you that I was wrong? Or did you figure that part out all by yourself?

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I’d been responding to the messages for a client who I’ll call Alicia when I got the first message. Alicia mostly did cosplay, and had recently uploaded a sort of Victorian/Steampunk set that might’ve been inspired by some video game. Either way, she’d been getting a lot of messages about that and I’d been sorting through them, sending simple responses to most of them and ignoring the particularly gross ones.

&#x200B;

When I first saw *The* message, I almost glossed over it since by itself, it was relatively tame. It had come from account called: *DonJuanTriumphant,* and simply read:

*“I love you, Amy.”*

&#x200B;

I’d been half reading messages for a few hours by that point, so I didn’t register the fact that it was *my* name they’d used, not Alicia’s until *after* I’d sent my reply of:

*“<3”*

&#x200B;

Then, once the content of that message *finally* hit me, I froze.

&#x200B;

I read it again.

*“I love you, Amy.”*

&#x200B;

*Why the fuck did this message use my name?*

&#x200B;

Maybe whoever had sent it was confused? Alicia and Amy were sorta similar, right? I mean, both of them began with the letter A! Maybe that was it? Maybe it was just a simple mistake!

&#x200B;

That thought didn’t do much to chase away the ominous sinking feeling in my gut… but I still tried to move on. None of the other messages I read for Alicia that day used my name, so it was easy to lie to myself and say that it had just been an honest typo. Alicia. Amy. Both names began with A. Similar enough. Easy to mix up.

&#x200B;

*DonJuanTriumphant* never replied while I was logged in to that account, and I admittedly had moved on to another account before I could see any other replies. As a rule, I hopped between accounts several times a day, clearing out the inbox quickly, and sending off my messages as quickly as possible, barely even thinking about them as I did. It was more time efficient not to spend a lot of time dwelling on the messages I sent unless I needed to. So I didn’t.

&#x200B;

There was nothing particularly out of sorts in the next account - which belonged to the two Hunky Country Boys. And after reading a fucking unhinged message from a woman asking if they would be willing to become her *‘Unvaxxed Aryan Sperm Donors’* and I quickly forgot about the possible Alicia/Amy mixup. I took a screenshot for my *‘Hall of Fame’* and had myself a good laugh at the message, which of course specified that the donation needed to be a *‘natural insemination’...* because I’m sure the fact that the monogamous Hunky Country Boys were engaged to be married, and frequently posted videos of them having hot gay sex gave a strong impression that they were open to *‘naturally inseminating’* some random woman.)

&#x200B;

The next account was unremarkable… as was the next. The mixup faded into the back of my mind and at the end of the day, I finally closed my laptop and enjoyed a nice, peaceful evening playing Pokemon without a single thought in my head about that message.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

It was a day or so later that I came across the second message from *DonJuanTriumphant*.

&#x200B;

I was going through one of my more interesting inboxes when I saw it. This one belonged to a moderately controversial model who went by *TexasGrace*, who’d been growing in popularity ever since some American pastor with a YouTube channel had singled her out as the latest sign that *The West Had Fallen*.

&#x200B;

Her gimmick was a little bit of a weird twist on those Tradwife influencers, where her SFW content featured her shooting guns in plain sundresses that showed off a little too much cleavage, and her less family friendly content featured her husband watching other men go to town on her. Apparently some people had considered her content to be a mockery of their personal values, and she’d been milking that attention for all it was worth… literally in some cases, since a video she’d posted of her making *‘breast milk ice cream’* had damn near doubled her popularity.

&#x200B;

I’m gonna be completely honest - I actually found her content to be a little disgusting. Her country fried online persona could be fun to write, but the fantasies her content fed into could at times only be described as *‘too much.’* I guess it had netted her a lot of fans, but for every message she got from a subscriber begging for the chance to fuck her, there was another from some sanctimonious incel talking about how she was just: *“Proof that all women were serpents.”* and about how: *“Men like her husband are innocent creatures in a world full of perverse women like her who used and defiled them!”*

&#x200B;

It was some genuinely pathetic shit, and I could almost see the sweaty creeps who’d sent those messages seething at their keyboards because they couldn’t admit that the real reason they were so upset is because someone in the world was having sex, and it wasn’t them.

&#x200B;

I never really dignified any of those messages with a reply. Giving those kinds of people any attention was just going to empower them further, and I’d gotten to the point where I was only skimming them before deleting them, not even giving them the privilege of being read.

&#x200B;

I’d actually gotten into a comfortable flow when the message from *DonJuanTruimphant* popped up, and it was buried in among the mad influx of new DMs, so just like before I almost responded to it without thinking.

&#x200B;

I just read the first three words and was about to type something like:

*“Aww, thank you honey.”* when I noticed my name at the end.

*“I love you, Amy.”*

&#x200B;

Suddenly, the comfortable flow I’d been in screeched to a halt. I found myself staring at the screen.

*At my name.*

And I just froze… unsure what to do, what to think, how to even proceed!

&#x200B;

I just sat there in silence, my mind barely functioning as I stared at those three letters on the screen,

*Amy.*

&#x200B;

This was not a simple mistake. This may be a surprise to some people, but Grace and Amy were *very different fucking names.*

&#x200B;

Someone knew I was answering Grace’s messages, and had left this there for me… they’d known I’d been answering Alicia’s messages too. I recognized the name. I recognized it because I remembered wondering if it was some sort of reference to The Phantom of the Opera.

&#x200B;

I didn’t know what to do… and it took me longer than it should have for me to realize that I probably needed to screenshot this.

&#x200B;

Once I’d taken the screenshot, I had the bright idea to go back into Alicia’s profile to see if I couldn’t find the message from *DonJuanTriumphant* there too. It didn’t take me long… I even saw the reply that had been sent to the single thoughtless heart I’d given as a reply.

*“I can’t wait to make you mine <3.”*

&#x200B;

I’d screenshotted that too, and immediately drafted an email to my supervisor, Jen. During my limited interactions with her, Jen had struck me as fairly reasonable and level headed. She had a *no nonsense* attitude, but was still pretty easy to talk to. I figured she’d probably sort this out… and to my relief, she got back to me immediately and asked if I was available to take a call from her.

&#x200B;

I told her I was and my phone rang a few minutes later.

&#x200B;

I don’t actually remember much about the conversation we had. I know that I told her what I’d seen, and that I’d told her which accounts it had been on. She promised me she’d look into it, before telling me to log out of both Grace and Alicia’s accounts. She didn’t tell me if she’d be giving them to someone else or handling them personally, and I didn’t really care enough to ask. I was just happy that she seemed to have my back.

&#x200B;

She even said I could take the rest of the day off if I needed to, but I assured her I could keep working. I mostly only did it for the money… but part of me also wanted to shrug all of this off and get back to normal as soon as possible. After our call, I took around a half hour to calm myself down, before logging in to a different, less busy account to ease myself back into my flow.

&#x200B;

The one I ended up picking belonged to a model named Lilith. I actually kinda liked her profile a little bit. She had more of a witchy/gothic aesthetic to her, which I personally kinda dug. Chatting with her subscribers was always interesting too, since her persona was generally pretty fun to write as. She had recently taken to riding Grace's coattails a little, which had drawn the attention of the Sanctimonious crowd. They'd been especially pissed off by a video she'd posted in response to some offended Mother talking about how masturbation was a form of witchcraft, which depicted a compilation of her masturbating while that text flashed over the screen.

&#x200B;

*Masturbation is a form of witchcraft.*

&#x200B;

Actually that video was kinda hot… the mismatched striped thigh highs she was wearing in one of the clips were really cute on her. And the fishnets she was wearing in a few of the others just looked good…

&#x200B;

…

&#x200B;

Hey, just because I work behind the counter at the candy store doesn’t mean I can’t admire the merchandise, right?!

&#x200B;

Anyway, chatting with some of her subscribers did help me get my mind off of things a little. A few of the more depraved ones even gave me a slight laugh, that lifted my spirits a little bit. But by the time I saw the message again… I still hadn’t quite forgotten the deep unease that seeing my own name on the screen had instilled in me, and the moment I read that username: *DonJuanTriumphant,* the quiet dread came flooding back.

&#x200B;

I flagged Jen again. Screenshotted the message, and moved on to another account while she took me off of Lilith’s account.

&#x200B;

The next one I went to belonged to a self declared *‘Femboy’* by the name of Joey, who typically posted anything from solo masturbation videos to full on gangbangs. He was admittedly one of my least interesting clients, but as a result of that most of his subscribers didn’t send anything too out there either.

&#x200B;

This time I didn’t even get the opportunity to fall into any sort of rhythm with the work. It took less than an hour for me to see a message from *DonJuanTriumphant*, and it was the exact same message I’d seen everywhere else.

*“I love you, Amy.”*

&#x200B;

After that, I couldn’t keep going.

&#x200B;

I reported it to Jen, then logged off, closed my laptop and told myself that I wasn’t going to so much as *think* about work for the rest of the day.

&#x200B;

I still did.

&#x200B;

I still felt an uneasy weight hanging over my head. One that I couldn’t quite shake off. A quiet dread over what would happen when I logged back in. I started wondering how this could’ve all been my own fault. Had I made some sort of mistake with one of the subscribers? Accidentally revealed something about myself? I didn’t actually recognize the name *‘DonJuanTriumphant’,* but I also chatted with so many random people that there was no way I could ever hope to remember all of their names.

&#x200B;

I didn’t sleep that night.

&#x200B;

I lay awake in bed, but couldn’t doze off, my mind racing with endless *‘What If’s’.* I eventually pulled myself out of bed, got into my wheelchair and went out into the living room to put on some mindless TV to try and take my mind off of things, but it didn’t do me any good.

&#x200B;

When it was time to log in for work the next morning, I was running on zero sleep.

&#x200B;

I had a call with Jen first thing in the morning. 

&#x200B;

She told me that she was still looking into the matter, and hadn’t yet figured out how this *DonJuanTriumpant* had gotten my name, or how he knew which profiles I was working on. She told me that her working theory was that it was some sort of prank from someone else on the team… which admittedly *would* have explained a lot. How they knew my name, how they knew which models I was assigned to, and how they knew when to send the messages so that I’d be the one to find them, as opposed to any of the other chatters who were assigned to those Models. But neither she nor I could figure out who would want to pull a prank that messed up on me or even why. It’s not like our company culture was all that close knit. I’d only ever spoken to a handful of other chatters and none of us exactly had much of a relationship!

&#x200B;

For as practical an answer as it was - the prank theory didn’t make a lot of sense… and so it did little to set my mind at ease.

&#x200B;

Still, Jen assured me that she was doing everything she could and told me to show her any other odd messages I received that day. I promised I would… and it wasn’t even a half hour later that I was messaging her with the first of the day.

&#x200B;

It was on one of my lower traffic models. A girl by the name of Samantha who got most of her money from live streaming. She was one of those girls who played video games in revealing outfits, with her most popular streams having a dedicated *‘foot’* camera, although there really wasn’t much to her beyond that. She only had about four or five dedicated subscribers… and *DonJuanTriumphants* message had stood out from the usual crowd like a sore thumb. The same message as always.

&#x200B;

I knew then that he wasn’t going to leave me alone, no matter how many times I reported it to Jen. I still tried… but I knew.

&#x200B;

On the channels of cosplay girls, twinks, dominatrixes, exhibitionists… he was always there, and as the next few hours went on, the frequency of my messages to Jen grew. Screencap after screencap after screencap… each one leaving me feeling more and more paranoid and uncomfortable in my own skin.

&#x200B;

I found myself glancing around, expecting to see someone watching me and dreading the moment the next message came in… and it always did come in.

Always.

Eventually I just couldn’t take it anymore.

&#x200B;

I’d been on the profile of one of my weirder models… if you could call it a model. It was technically just fanart of someone's Furry OC - although the messages it got from its subscribers were usually entertaining. Most of them sent their messages in character as their fursonas, trying to RP with the illustrious Hulda, the ‘*sexy anthro wildebeest*’ who looked as if someone had experienced a very specific awakening while watching a particular tale as old as time from the Disney Renaissance. I suppose to the artist's credit, Hulda *was* reasonably sexy. The *anthro* aspect was a turn off for me, but I could clearly see why she appealed to a certain group of people, which feels like a more roundabout way of saying: ‘*I’m not a furry, but…*’

&#x200B;

I digress…

&#x200B;

I almost dreaded logging into Hulda’s account, since I already knew what was waiting for me and felt almost sad to know that I’d soon be saying goodbye to her too. Chatting with her fans had always been strange, but fun… and while I waited for the inevitable, I did exchange a few messages with some of them, typing out in character replies that felt bizarrely nostalgic.

&#x200B;

I’d been in the middle of a riveting, completely non sexual conversation with Frankie the Wolf when I saw it.

&#x200B;

A new message from *DonJuanTriumphant.* And as soon as I saw that name, I felt my blood boil.

&#x200B;

Why was he doing this? Why was he stalking me? Why was he tormenting me? I couldn’t take this anymore! *I shouldn’t have had to take this anymore!* And before I could stop myself… before I could think, or second guess myself, I was typing my reply.

*“I love you, Amy.”* His message read.

&#x200B;

Mine read: *“LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE, YOU FUCKING PSYCHOPATH!”*

Followed by: *“MESSAGE ME AGAIN, AND I’LL FUCKING KILL YOU!”*

&#x200B;

His reply came almost immediately.

*“I can’t wait to make you mine <3.”*

&#x200B;

I slammed my laptop shut, and started to scream, tears streaming down my cheeks. I hurled my laptop onto my bed, and knew I couldn’t do this for one second more. Whoever was behind this sick prank, if indeed it *was* just a prank, had won! I was done! I called Jen a few minutes later… and I told her I needed to put in my resignation. She only sounded mildly surprised.

&#x200B;

Then, I left my laptop behind, and rolled myself out onto my balcony to get some fresh air. If my legs still worked, I’d probably have tried to take a walk… but no… the balcony was as far as I could go.

&#x200B;

I sat in silence, staring out at the London skyline and watching as a light drizzle peppered the city. Despite the distant lights of other apartments, I still felt so indescribably alone. I felt like my world was burning down around me. It was just a job… I’d just quit one stupid, shitty little job where I was *clearly* being harassed!

&#x200B;

But now new questions started to pop up… how would I pay the rent? How would I pay for food? I wasn’t exactly rolling in savings. I needed that paycheque, and as I said before most people didn’t really want to hire a girl in a wheelchair. Maybe I could call Jen back? Tell her I’d changed my mind? She’d probably understand! But… that felt so much like admitting defeat…

&#x200B;

I was just so overwhelmed and didn’t know what to do, and I was scared and I just couldn’t… couldn’t handle it. So I stared out at the rain… and I didn’t call Jen.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

The next several days were quiet.

&#x200B;

I’d logged out of everything related to my old job, and started to finally close that chapter of my life. I didn’t think about OnlyFans or porn, I just started looking for other Work From Home opportunities, and even landed a single interview!

&#x200B;

I’d thought that this was a sign that things were going to be okay! I had enough money to coast for a month or so, give or take. It would be tight, but I could make it work! I’d find something new, have a fresh start and look back at my time as an OnlyFans chatter with a chuckle a year or so later!

&#x200B;

The day of my interview, I’d set up my laptop in my home office, and had set up my webcam. My hair was done nicely, I was wearing my best blouse and I felt ready to ace this! The interviewer logged on to the chat service, although their webcam didn’t turn on. The screen remained blank, although something about it *had* changed slightly.

&#x200B;

I’d called out *“Hello?”* Beginning the virtual dance of making sure everyone was connected that preceded every professional video call ever… and I heard only silence in response.

*“Hello?”* I asked again… and that’s when I heard it.

&#x200B;

A low, almost seductive voice, dripping with raw lust speaking to me. Saying my name.

*“Amy…”*

&#x200B;

My blood turned to ice in my veins.

*“I love you, Amy…”*

&#x200B;

The darkness on the screen seemed to shift and writhe, as if there was more to it than just black. For a moment, I was almost certain that the darkness was *made* of something, as if this was a video feed of several dark shapes, gyrating together… but I didn’t allow myself to look for long enough to be sure. I slammed my laptop closed, my breathing heavy and panicked. I was on the verge of tears again.

&#x200B;

It hadn’t stopped. Even after leaving my former job… it hadn’t stopped.

&#x200B;

From where I’d placed it on my desk, my phone began to ring. It buzzed urgently on the wooden surface of the desk and I looked over at it with a silent dread.

&#x200B;

*Unknown Caller.*

&#x200B;

I knew who it was. Deep in my bones, I knew.

&#x200B;

I threw the phone across the room, but it just kept on buzzing.

Buzzing.

Buzzing.

&#x200B;

Even though no one  else was around, and warm sunlight shone in through all of my windows, I couldn’t help but feel an air of dread. I couldn’t help but feel watched. I left my phone on the floor, refusing to touch it.

&#x200B;

The buzzing never stopped. I still heard it even when I’d left the room. I still felt eyes on me, even though there were none around. Not just watching eyes, either. This was something far worse.

&#x200B;

It was the feeling I used to get when I was a girl and some lecherous creep felt the need to size me up, their eyes traveling up my legs, lingering on my hips and chest. Undressing me. Reducing me down to nothing but fuckable parts. It was *those* kinds of eyes.

&#x200B;

If I could have left the apartment, I would have… but where could I really go? Wheeling myself out was possible, but making my way down the street would have been difficult. It’s not like there was anybody I could call! And where would I even go? To visit a friend? What friends?! To the police? Would they even believe me? What then? What else could I do but sit and try to think this through?

&#x200B;

I couldn’t shake the feeling that a smarter mind than mine would’ve probably offered me some simple, pragmatic solution. *“Oh, why didn’t you do X? You really should’ve just done Y. Obvious, really.”* But the simple, pragmatic solutions that everyone on the internet seems to already know are easy to miss when you’re in the present moment, and helplessness takes hold of a person with disturbing speed.

&#x200B;

I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was simply waiting for the situation to get worse… and I suppose in a sense I was, because the fact of the matter was that I truly did not know what else to do. Eventually my phone ran out of battery, and all went silent.

&#x200B;

I left it on the floor.

&#x200B;

I didn’t touch my laptop again either. I was too afraid of what would happen if I did. I did consider trying to leave the house. Maybe getting a hotel, or something like that. But I simply didn’t have the money for it.

&#x200B;

So instead, as night fell I wheeled myself into my bedroom and hoisted myself up into bed, hoping that maybe sleeping would make it all better. I don’t think I knew what was coming as I pulled the covers over myself… but I think I knew it had to be something.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I don’t remember how surprised I was when I woke up to my dead phone buzzing on my nightstand. The screen was facing up, but instead of the message I’d seen before: *‘Unknown Caller’* now it read: *‘I Love You.’*

&#x200B;

My heart skipped a beat, and I swept it off the bedside table, sending it tumbling into the space between the table and the wall. The buzzing didn’t stop.

&#x200B;

I suddenly heard movement somewhere else in the apartment. Coming from my office, I think, but I couldn’t be sure. It could’ve really been coming from anywhere. And as I lay in bed, listening to whatever was in my apartment shuffle around… I heard it speak.

&#x200B;

***“I love you, Amy…”***

&#x200B;

The panic gripped me immediately. Something was in here with me… hunting me… and I did not want to know what it was going to do to me when it got to me.

&#x200B;

With arms shaking violently, I hoisted myself up, pulling my wheelchair closer to the bed as I clumsily fell into it. I was not very fast. But I tried to move as quickly as I could, using one hand grip the wall and try to pull myself forward a little faster as I tried to escape.

&#x200B;

The only place I could really go was out into the hallway… I didn’t know how bad of an idea that was, but I also didn’t have any other choices. As far as I could see in the darkness, the hall was clear, and trying to hide my panicked breathing, I rolled myself quickly into the living room, trying to make it to the front door.

&#x200B;

I almost made it… almost.

&#x200B;

Then I heard that low, whispering voice behind me.

&#x200B;

***“AMY.”***

&#x200B;

Something grabbed my wheelchair, and I felt something brush through my hair.

&#x200B;

I couldn’t stop myself from screaming, and without a second thought I threw myself out of my chair and onto the ground. Looking back, I only saw darkness as I dragged myself across the floor, looking for any salvation I could find. It was hard to say for sure *exactly* what I saw through my frightened tears… although I’m sure there had to be something more than just darkness. I’m sure of it.

&#x200B;

Whatever it was, the darkness behind me seemed to spread, creeping toward the front door to cut off my escape, and with nowhere else to go I crawled toward the balcony.

&#x200B;

***“Amy…”*** It crooned, and I heard something drawing closer to me. Something in the darkness. Its voice oozed lust… and that lust filled me with a fear I’ve never felt before. The balcony door was so close, and thankfully unlocked. I was able to pull it open from the floor and begin dragging myself outside.

&#x200B;

The darkness seemed to grow behind me, and after I pulled my legs through the door, I gripped it tight and slid it closed, hoping in vain that it might stop whatever it was that was coming for me.

&#x200B;

I heard a dull thud as shapes were pressed against the glass. Writhing human body parts. Breasts, limbs, faces contorted in ecstasy, wild eyes fixated on me and grinning as if inviting me to join. Some of them, I could’ve sworn I’d recognized as the faces of Models I’d once worked for… TexasGrace, Lilith, Lillie, Hunky Country Boys Danny and Austin…

***“Amy… Amy… Amy…”***

&#x200B;

The voice, which now sounded like a chorus chanted my name with an almost sexual urgency. The mass of writhing flesh pressed against the glass and I saw cracks begin to form on its surface.

&#x200B;

I knew it would not hold… so I took the only escape I had.

&#x200B;

I grabbed the railing. I lifted myself over the balcony… and I let myself fall.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

The doctors say I’m lucky to still be alive. There was a rough patch there where I wasn’t… but as of right now, I’m still ticking. I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or not.

&#x200B;

The police found nothing in my home. No sign of forced entry or that anyone or anything other than me had ever been there. I know they probably think I’m just crazy, and while I honestly hope they’re right… I’m not sure they are.

&#x200B;

By my own request, I’ve never been entirely alone while I’ve been in the hospital. I’m currently sharing a room with a few other people, and so far nothing strange has happened, although I’ve also been making a point to limit the time I spend on my phone or my computer. I don’t know how much difference it’s made, but it makes me feel better.

&#x200B;

I can’t stay in the hospital forever though. Sooner or later, I’ll have to go home, and I don’t know what’s going to happen to me then.

&#x200B;

I can’t help but notice that most of the old models I used to work for aren’t posting anymore. None of them have really said why, but I can’t help but wonder if I already know. I don’t know what this is.

&#x200B;

I know it’s hungry… lustful… insatiable… but that’s it. Other than that, I don’t think I can even begin to fathom it.

&#x200B;

I don’t know what I did to get its attention. And I don’t know if I’ll ever really escape from it.

&#x200B;

I’m not sure if I can.
