My Grandpa died last week. He wasn’t physically in my life very much, but he was supportive from a distance. He never attended my High School games, and he wasn’t even there for my college graduation. But, he always managed to call. He would remind me of how much he missed me, and would regale me in his adventures for the week. 

He was an active man. Retired, but living at the edge of the world and thrived off the land. He even built his own house out there in that little town far away from me and everyone else. He was so happy to tell me when he finished it. He even sent me the blueprints, and I got to design my own room for when I could come and visit. He lived at the edge of the world, loved me, and never struggled to survive. Which is why I couldn’t accept his sudden death. 

They said he did it to himself. No. I didn’t accept it at all. I still don't. He wanted to show me his home. He wanted me there. He wanted to live, and I *had* to know why someone wanted him dead.

He left me the home he built in his will, and that’s where I went. It was more beautiful in person than the pictures he sent. 

The house he built at the edge of the world was a thing of quiet grandeur. It loomed at the top of a winding dirt road, where the land crumbles into rocky cliffs and the sea beyond stretches into an endless, gray horizon. Built by my grandfather’s hands, it was meant to be a legacy. 

The air around it smelled faintly of salt and something else, like fresh dirt and dewy grass. The wooden frame, though solid, seemed to sigh when the wind passed through its eaves, as if exhaling after holding its breath too long. The tall and narrow windows let in just enough light to feel unsettling, their glass warped ever so slightly, so that the world outside always looked a little off. They were thin too, and allowed in the delicate noise of crashing waves at the cliff side below.

Inside, the floors creaked in places where no one stepped. The wallpaper, once rich with intricate patterns, had begun to peel in long, curling strips. My grandpa’s study was locked, yet some nights, when the house was at its stillest, I could swear I heard the faint rustling of pages, as if someone were turning them slowly, deliberately.

I was only there a few days, and there were already some things that bothered me deeply. The townspeople never spoke of the house, not directly. Their glances lingered too long when they saw me coming and their smiles always seemed a little forced, like they knew something I didn’t. When I mentioned where my grandpa lived, the conversation would shift, subtle, but noticeably uncomfortable. 

At night, the wind pressed against the walls, whispering through the cracks. I told myself it was nothing. Just the house settling, just the wind. But sometimes, when I laid awake in the dark, I felt something else. Something listening. Watching. Waiting.

The first place to look was the study. I had a gut feeling that room was important. It was the room where my grandpa spent all his time. Anything of value would be in there. I just had to find the key, and after sweeping through the entire house I came up empty handed. The fruitless search was infuriating.

Late at night I was pouring myself a glass of whiskey from the decanter in the kitchen, debating whether a boot through that door would bring me enough catharsis or an axe would. It was pouring rain outside. Crashes of thunder rattled those thin windows, and the calm sounds of the sea couldn’t be heard. Just the turbulent storms of weather and mind. I looked up and saw it, the attic hatch.

The attic was mostly barren, with some small furniture or memorabilia covered in sheets. The thing that caught my eye though was a framed photograph. It was a picture of me and my grandpa. It was faded, and it stood on top of a pile of boxes facing the hatch. It was the only photo of him I saw in that house, and it had me in it too. Immediately, I knew he wanted me to find it. Seeing the thing brought some tears to my eyes, but when I started back down the hatch, I dropped it.

The frame shattered on the floor. I cursed, and jumped down to ensure the photo itself was alright, but there was something else in that frame. A key, and a message.

It was a handwritten note on the back of our picture. *“Secrets kept safe until the truth must be known.”*

I was thrilled, and yet somewhat uneasy. My grandpa knew I would be the one to figure out his mysterious death. He trusted me to catch his killer. It was starting to unravel, the very first clue he left behind and I scrambled to his study. 

The room was filled to the brim with books. Dust motes swirled among the flashing pale light of thunder. Journals filled every shelf. Abstract art and symbols were painted on large pages, pinned to walls. In the middle of the room was his desk, and there laid a thick and heavy diary. 

The diary was filled with my grandpa’s daily life. Among his journals, though, were references to “meetings” with his friends. I didn’t know my grandpa had any. In the pages where his friends had been mentioned, were the same patterns he painted and pinned to the walls. They were intricate, beautiful, and of dihedral symmetry. Like unnatural snowflakes fell on the pages, and were enlarged to show every detail they contained. The last few pages were of my most concern though. They had to contain something to point me in the right direction regarding his death, and they did. 

He said a secret meeting was held at the edge of the world. Something to do with an awakening, or a revival, and someone called Thul’korr. It was the day he died, and I knew that these “friends” had something to do with it. These people he was investigating in this little town so far away from civilization, *they* killed him.

I went to bed that night with more questions than I ever had, but that photograph was constantly invading my consciousness. I didn’t remember it. It looked like I was about five years old, and he was crouching over me with his hand on my head, roughing up my hair. He was wearing a blue collared button down and khakis. He was also wearing his favorite watch. It’s one of the only things I remember about him. He wore that silver thing every day, never leaving the house without it. I had a huge grin on my face. Then, my mothers words came to me. 

“Your grandpa can’t stay sweetie, he has important work to do. You can only visit him when you’re older. You’ll understand”.

I never did. I still don’t. 

I fell asleep that night unnerved. That aching feeling someone was watching me crept up again, and so I left all the lights on, blinds closed. I could’ve sworn I saw movement outside, just beyond the tree line.

The town at the end of the world is a place where moisture thrives. It flows in from the ocean in the west, and from the forest in the east. Dew drips off of every surface, and thick fog permeates the air every morning. This means most things in the town are made of wood. Any bare metal exposed to the elements can’t stand the moisture, and turns to rust. The town hall, post office, civic center, all fresh, unpainted, wood. 

I went on a walk that day through town to clear my mind, and for groceries. The mixture of booze and family secrets doesn’t sit well in the mind or body, so I prescribed myself a calm walk through town to dissect my thoughts and find answers. Who *are* these friends? How can I find them? How could I find proof they killed him? Am I jumping to conclusions here?

I debated myself until I noticed something strange. A man following me. He trailed not too far behind. He seemed nervous. Fidgety. His head hunkered low and he wore a hoodie that covered most of his face. He was talking to himself. My suspicions turned to paranoia. 

I noticed him from further up the hill close to my grandpa’s house. He had been behind me ever since. I decided to turn right, he followed. I turned right again, he was behind me. One last time, still there. Definitely following. 

I turned down an alley, and started to sprint. I made it four steps before I got pinned to the wall. He threw me against it with unnatural force. It knocked the wind out of me, and before I could scream he covered my mouth, and held my throat.

“Listen girl, you shouldn’t have looked,” he said in a rushed whisper.

He darted his head, looking down the alley before he spoke again. “But now you have to know. Find the place where the dead speak.”

He let go of me and ran away. I rubbed my sore throat and thought if it would bruise, but also, was that a *friend*? He seemed desperate. I had a feeling that was the only way he could help me. Even if it was a trap, I had to get answers, and I knew exactly where to go.

While walking to the cemetery my senses were dialed to eleven. The sudden attack left me scared, and I was suspicious of everyone at that point. People looked at me from across the street, hands held to their faces. Whispering, and staring. I walked faster.

The closer I got to the cemetery, the more I noticed them. Symbols. The same ones drawn in my grandpas’ study were carved into trees. Drawn in the dirt. Marking graves. The sun was setting, and I noticed a puddle of blood glimmering in orange glow. 

A fresh corpse laid over a stone, the body carved and twisted into a snowflake. It was my grandpa. 

I sobbed over his corpse. The loss was paralyzing. I squeezed his crooked hands and cried over his smashed body. Covered in blood, my tears ran dry. The reality, no, the finality of his death made me come to my senses. He was supposed to be dead a while ago. Those *friends* aren’t just some people, but everyone that lives at the edge of the world. His body must have been laying there all day, and no one came. All the strange looks. The crooked smiles. The half answers. The whole town killed him. I was in over my head. I had to leave. 

I ran to his house as fast as I could. 

The hill to the house was covered in those symbols. They were carved into the ground while I was away, and littered every inch of hillside. A voice called to me from the treeline beyond the snowflakes on the ground. It was the same man as before. 

“You’re too late!” he shouted. “It’s already done, don’t go!”

He ducked behind some branches and fled. I grimaced, and turned back toward the house.

I packed my things and combed through the study. The first thing I grabbed was my grandpa’s diary, but noticed a jewelry case sitting on a shelf beside the door. I opened it to find my grandpa's watch. It was the first time I was ever able to get my hands on it, and I definitely had to keep it. When I turned the face over though, something shocked me. A snowflake etched into the back of it. The same watch he had for all those years since my childhood. 

Before I could even think, I heard a knock at the door. 

I jolted up, and slightly pulled the curtains from a window to peek outside. It was already dark out, but something was glowing just outside my scope of vision. Something that casted a flickering orange light on the trees. A fire. And something else. People. Lots of people. I ran down the hall and looked through my bedroom window. The whole house was surrounded. They stood outside, hand in hand, and sang. That’s when I realized I didn't lock the front door. 

I heard from behind me, “The debt has been paid”. 

They hit me over the head, and I fell unconscious. 

I woke up tied to the dining room chair. Blood was crusting over my left eye, forcing it shut. My body was sore. I looked down to see myself dressed in a white gown, no shoes. People were everywhere inside my home, dousing it in what smelled like gasoline. 

A large man stood before me. He was a fortress. Thick, with muscle and fat. He was naked, and had a rabid look in his eyes. He stepped toward me. Slow, and methodical. Smiling like a kid on Christmas morning.

“You’re grandpa never told you, did he? Just how important you are.” He said, caressing my cheek.

In a rage, I tried to bite his hand. “You sick fucks killed him!”

He seemed shocked I would even say that. “No, no my dear. He did this to himself. He did it for you. For *all of us*.” 

He reached over to the dining room table and picked up a dark mass. It was a grotesque thing, twisted and alive in ways metal should not be. Jagged spires of blackened bone jutted upward, slick with something that gleamed like oil. Dark veins pulsed along its surface, writhing as though the ring itself breathed. It was big enough to fit over my head, and that's where he placed it. 

It dug into my flesh and I cried out in pain. 

“Our savior arrives,” he said. 

The people began to undress at my front door, leaving a pile of their clothes in the foyer. Men. Women. Children. After the last one left, they threw a match onto the pile. My grandpa’s home was suddenly up in flames.

The fire blazed around me, the smoke choking every breath I took, but I wasn’t done yet. The ropes that bound me to the chair burned away by the heat. Or, my own frantic desperation was able to unravel the knots. But the crown still sat heavy on my head. No matter the force I used to pry it off my head, it never budged. I had to escape. I had to fight.

The demon had already started to rise. I could feel its presence, a malevolent shadow creeping along my spine, crawling under my skin. It was glued to the ceiling now, a black humanoid figure. It looked like a burned man. Skin sloughing off its crooked form, spilling at my feet.

I tried to stand, but my legs shook beneath me. The fire’s heat and presence of the demon made it almost impossible to focus. It pounced on me. I closed my eyes, breathing deeply, trying to push it back, but it was too powerful.

It wanted in. It wanted me.

I felt it. A sharp, searing pain, like claws raking across my ribs, dragging up my throat. My mouth went dry, and before I could react, I tasted something foul. The air around me thickened, and I knew it was coming.

The demon wasn’t just going to take me. It was going to force its way in.

I screamed as I felt its claws tear into my throat, its weight pushing against my chest. I punched its bony, squishy body, trying to stop it, but the force was too much. I gasped, choking on the foul, burning presence as it pressed against my lips, forcing its way into me.

It was like swallowing fire. Raw, twisted power, seething with anger. I tried to fight it, to pull back, but it was already inside. My body jerked violently as its essence poured into my mouth, down my throat, and into my soul.

And then it was there. Inside me. A storm of darkness that flooded every inch of my being, filling me with a terrible, unnatural strength.

I struggled to control it. I fought to hold on to myself, but the demon was too strong, too vicious. It tore at my mind, clawed through my thoughts, demanding control. I fought back with every ounce of my will, struggling to force it back, but it was no use. It pressed harder, consuming me from the inside out.

And that’s when I felt it, a snap. The last vestiges of myself breaking apart. But instead of surrendering, I grinned. Because somewhere in that madness, I knew what I had to do.

With one last scream, I let the demon take me. But not the way it wanted. Not the way it expected.

I threw myself into the fire, my body a weapon as I smashed through the flames. I fought through the heat, through the pain, my mouth open wide as I wouldn’t let it try to break me. But it didn’t know, it didn’t understand.

I would control it.

When I walked out from the wreckage, the cult was there, kneeling, their faces twisted in grief. They saw what I had become, and they began to wail.

And I let them see, just for a moment.

I smiled, because at that moment, I knew they had made a mistake. They thought it was taking me, but it had only made me stronger. 

I ran. I ran past all those people writhing in grief on the ground. I ran past their burning town. I ran until my feet bled. I ran until I was safe. Until I made it home. 

You see, the house my grandfather built wasn’t just a legacy. It was a shrine. A throne built just for me.
