I see Death. Simple as that, nothing to beat around the bush about. He's a decently dressed man. Looks like something you'd see from the late 1800s. Grey beard. Black top hat. Long black coat. Never heard him speak. I remember seeing him behind my Great-Grandfather the last time I saw him at five years old.

I remember asking my dad afterwards if he was my Great-Grandfather's friend. My dad responded with the usual: "What? John, no one was there. Probably an old photo or something."

As time continued on, moved a bit, I kept seeing death. Sometimes around people who looked healthy and other times he was around people who should be dead.

Then that's when my Grandfather died. I was around ten years old when my grandfather passed. He was a good man and he had given me this golden cross. He told me once I passed we'll meet in heaven and will have great conversations. I remember looking at Death when my Grandfather began to pass. He was far more solemn than all the times before.

A few years later in my teen years, I became more religious trying to figure out why I saw Death. Every time I went and saw a Priest of all denominations, they would pray and do an exorcism over me. I had to my parents this before and they had encouraged me to get an exorcism. But that didn't work.

Around fifteen, then going into sixteen I was in a few plays and musicals and that's where I met some good friends. One of them was a girl named Sophie. She was a beautiful young girl. We looked a little alike so some people thought we were siblings. That was especially funny since we had to dance together in a musical we were in. At the beginning of the musical she and my other friends sang Happy Birthday to me. Which is one of my most treasured memories. Now I wasn't in love with Sophie. Was she pretty? Yes. When I talked to her did I want to thank God that I was alive and she was in my life? Yes. But I don't think I was in love, or at least was not ready. But I did care about her.

in the meantime during that I met an Anglican Bishop by the name of Bishop Tennant. He told me perhaps it was a gift, and I could preach to people the good word of the Lord before it was too late for them. I really liked that idea and ran with it. I was still only sixteen at the time, so I couldn't be a Priest just yet.

During one of the musicals, the star of the show, Henry's birthday. So we got there early and spent some time celebrating him out in the back parking lot where the sun was shining. And Sophie had us play this murder mystery game based on Doctor Who. (Henry was a massive Doctor Who fan)

Our friend Jane had her grandfather get pizza for us. He was a nice man, but again as he was coming out I saw Death following him. I tried to ignore him and turned around and saw Sophie, in the sunlight, she was dancing. It was like seeing Freyja from Norse Mythology dance in the sunlight. An otherworldly fae in the presence of mortals. Her dark red hair, just slightly above her shoulders. For one moment I completely forgot about my friend Death.

She of course ran up to me giggling and saying, "why are you judging me?"

"I'm not!" I rebutted, but I couldn't confess that I thought she was beautiful, I was too nervous. I still remember how beautiful she was that day.

As I turned I saw Death follow Jane's Grandfather back inside. I ran to Jane and grabbed her by the arm and said, perhaps a bit too loudly, "I think you should hug your grandfather!" Jane tilted her head in confusion, her brownish-blonde hair blowing in the wind with the tilt. She shrugged and did what I said.

The next day she texted: *Thanks, John for yesterday, encouraging to hug him. He just died. But I think I need some time alone.*

Sophie, Henry and pretty much everyone but Jane had no idea why I told her to say that. I don't talk to Jane much, but she probably knows why, or at least deep down does.

Years passed, I still speak to Henry and Jane, and a few others, but I lost touch with Sophie.

And I became a Priest. Anglican not Roman Catholic, the biggest difference is we can get married if we wish to. Seeing Death was useful, I was able to really encourage those who were next to death to accept Christ. Other Priests, Bishops and even laymen said they never seen someone so passionate.

But as a Priest I also have the duty to give people their last rites, and even witness those who die. And that was different. One woman had passed in front of me. I saw a whisper of her crawl into the coat of Death. It was horrifying, yet comforting as I saw Death whisk into white mist once done. It didn't look like it hurt, but it was still sad to see it. No mortal like me should have seen it.

During one week me and this other Priest, Father Benjamin, were blessing and giving people their last rites, or baptizing those who wish to be baptized before death.

I had just turned thirty as me and Father Ben were walking down the halls of hospital, going to bless the dying and that's when I saw *her*. Sophie. Those beautiful eyes and hair staring back at me, wearing a robe. "John?" she asked. I halted and saw her and smiled. I walked and gave her a handshake as I have before. "Sophie," I said. I noticed that her hand was fairly weak and cold. A nurse was right by her helping her walk. "You're a Priest?" asked Sophie, somewhat surprised. "God bless you."  
"Since when did you become a believer?" I asked her. Sophie from my memory wasn't particularly religious, fairly Diest or Agnostic. "A few years before I got sick," she said, "and a few arguments with my mom." She chuckled and so did I.

I turned to Father Benjamin. "You think you can take on the rest?" I asked.  
"Yes," said Father Ben, "go and bless her, I'll bless others." He then left.

I helped Sophie back to her room, her nurse giving her pills before said nurse leaving. I sat in the chair, right by her bed. She explained her disease to me. It was complicated sounding.

"I don't know if it's terminal," said Sophie, grabbing my hand and holding it.  
"I will be praying for you, Sophie."

And with that I saw him. I saw Death standing over her. I held back my voice. I wanted to yell at him and say: "No, not her! No more!" But I couldn't. Only I saw this man. But I looked at the door and Death nodded. He slowly backed out, leaving the room.

Maybe I was able to save her a few hours. I looked back at her, and smiled. Trying to hold back tears. "Is everything alright, John?" asked Sophie. I nodded and held her hand. "Yes," I said, "but did you tell me the truth."

"Ah, you got me," said Sophie, "a few days at the most. Few hours at the least. But I don't wanna talk about it. How about we reminisce?"

And thus we did. We chatted, talked, felt nostalgia, I blessed her with oils. It was nice. She then grabbed her phone and played music. It was from her favorite film. My fifth favorite film. She shakily stood up. And walked over to me. "You're a Priest, which is great for you, but can you dance?" she asked, outreaching her hand to me. I stood and held it. I put my hand on her hip, her hand on my shoudler. We began to sway and dance. It was nice. Just like how we used to. It was breathtaking.

"Thank God, we're here."

Sophie put her head to mine. "I wish we stayed in contact," she said.

"me too," I mumbled. We danced and danced, till she went back to the bed.

She looked at me, holding my hand. I knelt before her praying over her. "You will always be that nerdy, guy, who compared my eyes to your father." I laughed, cringing at that memory.

"I'm glad I met you. I wasn't gonna do that musical. But I felt it within me. I didn't believe in God then, but I look back and realize it was God pushing me." Her breath became ragged. She grasped at my hand. My free hand touched her cheek softly, praying over her.

"I know...I'm the one supposed to be confessing," she said, chuckling, "but...anything *you* want to confess?"

I nodded. "Sophie, I love you, since the day I met you." Sophie smiled. Resting her head against the pillow. She began to flatline. And Death appeared behind us. I turned my head finding him there. I left Sophie's hand and raised myself in front of Death.

"May God forgive me," I said, "I really want to kill you."

Death walked over and grabbed Sophie. Holding her in his arms. He looked at me before exiting. His eyes weren't that of a personification of a complex thing as death. But rather someone that was once mortal. A son of the first Man and Woman.

Death then opened his mouth. "She loved you." That was the first time I had ever heard Death speak and the last time I ever heard him speak.

I still miss Sophie everyday, I will always love her. God help us all.
