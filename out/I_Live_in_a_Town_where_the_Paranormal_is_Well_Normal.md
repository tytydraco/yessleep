How do I even start this? No really, should I start with “Hi guys” or begin in all caps “HELP! IN TRAPPED IN THE MOST CURSED PLACE ON EARTH!”.

You know what? I'm already here typing so let's get into this.

So my fellow cult members of r/Nosleep. You know those spooky town stories with the stereotypical titles-like:

"My town's emergency alert system went off warning us not to look at the sky.

Оr

"Rules to survive X place, Nevada".

And of course the classic.

"My town's church is hiding a dark secret beneath the earth".

Well i'm in one of those towns now, and honestly? Those stories would be listed as “Twenty best bedtime stories for kids!” on the library's bulletin board.

So before I get into more details we must first get the “How did we get here?” achievement, because my trip to hell started with a series of odd-and or unfortunate-events involving a slight family drama, a grandpa who lost to death in Vegas, and a stolen car.

Picture this:

I just graduated college, with a degree that costs more than all my organs sold on the dark web. When my parents (Specifically my step-dad Ronald) decided they had enough of me freeloading the moment I literally threw off my graduation cap that was still warm.

"Clarkson you're twenty one. Get a job. Get a life. Be a man". Ronald told me while I WAS THREE STEPS FROM EATING DINNER.

Like sure Ronald. Let me, a Gen Z(Technically the most broke generation) walts in the nearest office building to automatically get hired and earn six-figures, before buying a house that costs just twelve-thousand dollars with a nice picket fence like it's nineteen-fifties america. Now honestly I thought you would get it being a millennial, but I guess you living in the Netherlands for most of your life where free universal healthcare is A human right didn't exactly inform you on how the rest of the world was doing.

So anyways. Just when I thought I was utterly screwed in all ways possible that's when... He appeared.

Imagine a lawyer that came straight out of Stephen King. With a letter that looks more like a threat than an invitation. And in it? A will.

Specifically my grandpa's will with the opening lines being this:

"If you're reading this grandson. It means I finally lost to Death while gambling in Vegas, but honestly? Fair game, man knows his poker well and allowed me some time to get my affairs in order. So you might be wondering why I am giving my inheritance to you? Well I don't trust my daughter's husband-or new husband (It's been a while)-And I know for a fact that your mother will sell all my stuff for cheap before booking it with the money. And with that I decided to give all my assets to you".

Now this should've been my first and very obvious red flag, because who the hell dies from gambling with the Grim Reaper in Vegas? But aside from that everything else in the will was formal with a property in Alaska-which should've been my second red flag but I was broke, homeless, and desperate for hope-So I decided:



"You know what? why the Hell not!".



And so I packed my essentials (Which composed of my laptop, phone, and some candy I bought from Dollar General), and in the dead of night-like 2:00am-I "Borrowed" Ronald's car because apparently I never "Proven" myself for them to buy me my own car(Yes it's that bad). I'll never forget the look on Ronald's face as he walked out in his undies to be met with his Honda Civic pulling out the suburb while I blasted F"ree Bird" as I gave him the finger through the broken driver's window shouting "FUCK YOU RONALD!" Like it was some kind of coming of age story with me being the main character.

So for anyone curious as to get to the reality breaking town where I live in(To which I strongly advise you don't). Here's how:

Start by going west, and when I say go west. I mean go really, REALLY far west. As far west as possible to the point where you might accidentally find yourself playing with dolphins under the pacific ocean. Then go up north and frog-hop across Canada like you're a Mexican high on crack accused of illegal immigration. Then go to Alaska and take a quick break in Juneau to rethink if it's a good idea (Spoiler alert: I didn't do that part but added it here to act as your final warning). And then take the Alaskan highway and one of the first signs to know if your getting close is the feeling of panic from your lizard brain telling you to "Turn the fuck around now!".


Ignore that. 



Then after a while of that feeling you should see a turn off from your right that seems to be ignored by most vehicles like it was never there. 



Take that route.



Now at first everything will seem normal-and when I say normal, I mean to the point where it feels uncanny-but then if you choose to keep going you will see not one, not five, but at least TWENTY signs surrounding both sides of the road in multiple languages from Spanish, to latin, then even Sumerian, and hell even Brail... BRAIL! Because it's that bad for someone to have the dedication to warn the blind.

Now the warnings will be normal at first with messages like:

"Private property!".

"NO TRESPASSING!".

"Do not pass".

"Private Logging Area. Authorized Personnel only".

But then if you chose to keep going that's when... They get a bit extreme with the subtlety of desperation like a dude who didn't get the idea that his ex doesn't want him anymore:

"Military installation! Authorized personnel only!".

"Radioactive dumping ground! BEWARE!".

"Dangerous gas leak area! DO NOT PROCEED FURTHER!".

And after this? They finally lose their shit and can even pass as a patient in an insane asylum with the messages being:

"TURN AROUND NOW!"

"RUN YOU FOOL!".

"RECONSIDER YOUR DECISIONS!".

"MADNESS BEYOND HERE!".

"EVEN GOD AND SATAN AGREE NOT TO TOUCH THIS PLACE!".

Now if you're like me and choose to still keep driving you will be met momentarily by a nice scenic overlook of a Mountain ridge with glacial-like peaks like some kind of Van Gough painting.

Then after that you will be greeted by a sign that looks newer, glossy even with a cartoonic painting of said mountains and some charming green text that says:

"Welcome to Wendigo Alaska!".

and below that a slogan that reads:

"Nothing To See Here".

Now i'm going to be honest with you. First, yes that's the actual name of the town. Wendigo. Second, whoever came up with that slogan is either delusional as hell, or is addicted to irony like a meth user, but I digress.

After panning the sign, congratulations! You're one step away from entering the point of no return! So you will be greeted by a tunnel that looks like it lost to a fist fight with a giant, and upon making the grave mistake of entering inside you will need to turn on your headlights because they didn't bother adding tunnel  lights and it has the added benefits of being damp and colder than Satan's mortgage payments as well as hearing things tapping on the hood and the ride taking longer than it should've despite your odometer saving you've only been under there for two miles! 



... Right, I've only been under there for two miles.



And after that you will be greeted by the view of the coastal town of Wendigo-And yes this a coastal town at the far northwestern edge of the world. 



To describe you the town of Wendigo is... Kinda hard. The first thing you should know is it's in this weird limbo state of being too big to be a town while also being too small to be a city and too damn isolated to be called a suburbia, maybe you can call it a mid sized town or micro city? Eh all bet's are lont on me

The second thing you should know is the town's land area is surrounded on both sides by said mountain. To give you a good idea, you know the town of (And in probably going to butcher the spelling) Kazorucho from the manga Uzumaki? Yea well take almost the exact geography, replace the Japanese town with American culture and knee high deep snow, add a DLC expansion of the spiral curse, and add a bit of that Twin Peaks energy for the finishing touches.

And as for the third thing you should know? Well consider it your first introduction or a billboard sized neon sign that says “THIS TOWN IS CURSED MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE”. If you look right out your driver side window, there should be this lighthouse on a small island of impossible whiteness. No really, whoever painted that lighthouse must have gotten the coating from the fourth dimension. And if you keep going you will see that this lighthouse is connected to the mainland by this ridiculously long wooden dock like bridge that the ocean would occasionally slamming harshly into it like it lost an argument and was being a sore loser about it.

And as for the town itself? Well make no mistake when I say that where I just moved too would put all those cursed town stories to shame. Cryptids from your worst nightmares running around mid-day, sirens that either blare things in reverse Aramaic or gregorian chanting or both depending on where you're standing, and a sky that occasionally changes to TV static which makes me now believe we're in a simulation.

And now the locals. In most cursed town stories the townsfolk are usually terrified, saying things in hushed whispers, or giving the new guy the iconic weary side-eye. This place? Well here's the part that unsettles me more. The people here aren't just UNFAZED by the paranormal shit around them. They live with it, play with it, marry it, and hell they demand it to pay rent like this is just some mildly annoying HOA.

Seriously, to give you a good idea I want you to visualize what in about to describe in vivid detail:

So there I was just questioning what the hell I walked (Or drove) into after seeing that cursed lighthouse that almost made my eyes bleed when the second thing that would haunt my dreams appeared that day.

There were two guys, the first one was sitting on a lawn chair sipping a can of Bud light, and the second one? He was wrestling something I can only describe as the cursed lovechild of a spider and a scorpion the size of a desk on the bed of his pickup grunting-but not in pain-no he was grunting the same way you would grunt on that particular stain that refuses to get off your clothes. Their conversation? Well it kinda went Like this:

“So Kendric. How's it going over there?". The guy in the lawn chair asked the guy wrestling the thing on the truck bed whose name is apparently Kendrick.

"As expected. A pain in the ass". Kendric replied so casually.

“well tell me if it ate the heating system again. That way we have a good excuse to sue the crap out of it for some extra cash". The dude in the lawn chair added,



If you think that was weird, well believe me it gets worse from here.


As I kept driving I passed by a kid no older than nine wearing what I can only assume was a preacher's robe with gold trimmings holding a dagger in one hand while holding a dead possum in the other all while humming the main theme of silent hill.



I wish I was kidding.



Then I saw a little girl cry as her balloon floated away from her. And you know what her father said?

“Oh don't worry Agatha. You just unknowingly made a sacrifice to the Sky Leviathan. Thanks to you he will continue to bless our family with good Fortunes”.



…… 


…. What. The everloving. Fuck.


I then saw a man sitting on a bench drinking coco from a mug that had the words "Mondays are for blood letting. Tuesdays are a suggestion". Then from a manhole next to him a deer looking creature with one eye and covered in sewage sludge poked its head out. releasing a sound that can only be replicated if you tried to step on a dying frog while it tried to croak at the same time.

The guy just slowly turned his head while sipping his coco, then nodded before saying:

"Guess the deer thing is out early this year".

And then he proceeded to go back sipping his coco without a care in the world while that thing made another gutteral noise before sinking back in Its sewer lair to do God knows what.

While my stomach was still doing the three-sixty and the Honda barely making it to the middle of town I passed by an apartment looking building where I saw another man arguing with one of those classic eldritch entities shouting:

“Listen ZAGOROTH THE BREAKER OF MINDS! I don't care if you give me horrific visions of places the human mind was never sent to see! You still have to pay your half of the rent!".

That thing snarled at him. And all he did was throw a shoe at it like it was just a misbehaving dog.

Honestly? That gave me a bit of chuckle because of the absurdity, but then my moment of temporary joy was cut off when I saw a man get eaten by something I can only say has too many teeth while the woman walking next to him sighed while giving an expression of mild annoyance.

"Danmit Harold! You better get out of there or you're going to miss poker night!", she said like that happened too many times before.

And lastly I passed by the town's public library which looked more like if a cursed gothic cathedral made a deal with bureaucracy, and right there on the window was their community board. And my GOD that community board listed things only a drunk or insane person would write. how I couldn't remender the rest, but I managed to remember just three things that I will list here:



-Lost: Rationality. Last seen near   twisted oakwood pines boulevard.  Report if spotted.



-Please return mayor Evermore's spine. It's his turn to host poker night and his second spine is allergic to card shuffling, while his third is taking a vacation in Iowa.                



-And Remember people of the Church of the One True God. Confessions are every Sunday evening and we accept all forms of donation (Even a ruptured appendix).



Yea safe to say after that I just tried my best to keep an eye on the road. 



Now time for grandpa's house. Surprisingly, it's mostly normal. 

To give you an idea what his home looks like. Picture a two story American home that never left the fifties, white picket fence and all(Excluding the mailbox that has teeth). 

And the inside? 

Mostly the same with those old oak tables, cloth sofas, an old box TV, and floral pastels that haven't seen modernity since the Eisenhower administration.

Upstairs there were three bedrooms(I took the master obviously), the second one is for guests, while the third is for children.
Then there are three bathrooms as well with the third being in the basement(For reasons I never wish to know). And lastly an attic with a bunch of old stuff and a shadow that would whisper to you your deepest secrets every so often. 

So yea I guess this is my life now. Clarkson formerly lived in Detroit. Now living in the cursed Bermuda triangle of the arctic circle. 


More stories if I survive… Which seems to be getting less hopeful by the hour.
