I've been told that writing these events out might help me move on, but what finally prompted me to write this was a realization that, the right person, the right horribly unlucky person, will read this, and it will save them. In that sense, I now feel obligated to get this out there.

I'll give you all some quick background. I'm from Colorado. Currently, I'm working for a fintech startup. It’s just another one hoping to get bought up by one of the big banks like Schwab or whatever, but it's good resume-building, and I like my team. I was still in college, majoring in CompSci, at the time of this story. You'll have to check my page to see me gripe about getting ribbed by engineering majors and being surrounded by Adderall junkies. 

Anyway, I'd just completed my 5th semester, and it was winter break. I'm a big skier, shocking, I know, but I wasn't exactly loaded either. My friend Reggie and I wanted to go on a skiing trip before graduating, so we did a lot of research. We got a great deal on this cabin near our favorite slopes, but we couldn't afford it ourselves, so we had to accept that a couple of random guys would also be staying there.

We worked everything out, and the cabin owner contacted our new "roommates." We texted back and forth, and on the phone, we liked them both for the most part. Their names were Preston and John, and they were both out of state. I enjoyed talking to them about their love of skiing and how this was all they could afford after a flight. However, I quickly soured on them when we finally got to the cabin. They were both the sort of Colorado tourists who wouldn't stop saying stuff like "bagging a fourteener", "colorful Colorado", "pow day", and more than once Preston referenced that stupid Blucifer statue. I already think all that crap is annoying from natives, but to hear two out-of-state guys talk like that was incredibly irritating. I also quickly remarked on their rude behavior. John was alright; he just wasn't well-mannered, but Preston especially seemed to have no filter for judgmental thoughts or complaints. As we were moving in, I kept hearing things like:

"Bro, walk a little faster. It's not that hard."

And:

You're not gonna wear that deodorant this whole time, right?"

I'm a lot more moderate than I should be most of the time, but still, after Preston said: "Hey, we're gonna smoke while we're here, and you two are just gonna have to be cool with that." Reggie and I lost our cool on him. His friend John wasn't much help; I don't think it was because he was avoiding conflict, I think he just knew we were right. We argued and yelled with each other for a while. Finally, we made it clear that he wasn't going to smoke in the cabin; we didn't care that "the owner already told me it's cool bro and he's not gonna say shit if we smoke inside. Calm down, guys. It's literally not that deep." We didn't smoke, and we didn't want smoke inside. There was some pushback, but when Reggie flat out said:

If you whip a bong out, I'll smash it."

Preston just gave us a dirty look and stormed off. John stood there awkwardly for a second. He gave us one of those looks that said, "I gotta agree with him 'cause he's my friend, but I know you all aren't wrong," and then he walked off after Preston. 

The rest of the night was uneventful. Preston sulked in his room for a long time and loudly whined about us to his girlfriend on the phone. But John came down and pitched into the pizza order we were making. There's a great place up there we used to love to order from called Pene di Lumaca. Although, I'm not sure it's even still there. It could be gone, or maybe they knew too. Maybe they knew how to survive and just didn't bother warning anyone. Perhaps they're still there slinging four cheese pizzas, pretending nothing ever happened.

Preston finally came down after the food was delivered; it got a kick out of John seeing the guy bring us our order on a snowmobile. It was a quiet and strained meal, but we all ended up chatting there. I still wasn't a fan of them at all, and Preston still couldn't quit saying all that tourist crap. He talked about "loving the mile-high city" or something cliche like that, but I enjoyed hearing a little about their lives in Oregon and about a couple of their skiing wipeout stories. Still, it was clear that we were talking just to keep the peace for the remainder of the stay. They didn't like us at all either.

After dinner, Reggie and I put on one of those terrible Resident Evil movies we loved, one of the animated ones, and got our equipment ready in the living room. Preston and John had already returned to their rooms at that point, but I couldn't hear Preston complaining to his girlfriend anymore. I remember he came downstairs for water at some point. He stopped at the stairs and, mostly mumbling, he said:

Hey, there's literally no reason not to smoke in here, but I'm not gonna press it. I probably shouldn't have snapped or whatever. Goodnight."

I appreciated the sentiment, but he was still a dick. We just brushed it off and got back to work. Finally, I went to bed and tried calling my mom before heading to bed. No reception at all. I know we were on a mountain, but still, it was weird. I asked Reggie, and he said he wasn't getting any service either. Again, odd, but not anything to worry about yet. I just went to bed, hoping the service would return in the morning.

I woke up the following day, and nothing around me was unusual at first glance, but it was notably colder than last night. The heat was still on, but it was at least 5 degrees colder. I got out of bed to put my socks on, but I noticed it was still dark outside. I looked at my alarm clock; it said it was still early, but the sun was definitely up at this point. When my phone confirmed the time, I moved the curtains to the side to check. I tried to look out of my window, but I was met with a wall of snow. I touched the window with my fingertips; it was completely frozen.

I didn't know what to make of it. I was calm; we had some food, and the electricity was still on, so it wasn't immediately dangerous, but still, my bedroom was on the second floor; we'd been snowed up to the second floor, at least. I know it's Colorado, and we were on a mountain, but still, this amount of snow was ridiculous, nearly impossible from what I've been told about the weather signals from that time. When I went to check my phone, I saw that I still had no service; at that point, I was unnerved, but still nothing too bad.

I went downstairs to find Reggie and Preston discussing the snow. Reggie said something about digging our way out, but Preston quickly shut him down.

Nah bro we ain't getting through that, all you'd do is fill the living room full of snow."

He could have said it a little more politely, but I agreed. We were stuck for now. Nobody else was getting any signal, either. I asked where John was. Preston started to say something.

Oh, I mean, he's probably just sleeping in. He stayed up late to-"

Preston's eyes were caught by something beside the door. I followed his gaze, but I saw nothing.

What's wrong?"

John went out to smoke last night. After we all headed to bed, he told me he was gonna try some of his gear on and light up in the yard."

Did you ever hear him come back?"

No, dude. I didn't go cause I was already sleeping; he woke me up to ask, and then I passed back out. His boots aren't there anymore."

We went upstairs and knocked on his room before finding no one there. Preston checked the basement, and I checked the attic. Nothing, and what's worse is I found that the attic window was also blocked by snow. The snow was now piled up at least 28 feet. Nothing else was remarkable in the attic, just tools and leftover construction supplies. I found some PVC pipes in the corner, however. I had an idea, but Reggie yelled up at me, so I put it off for later and headed back down the ladder and then down the stairs.

He's not here."

I felt bad for having felt so much hate for Preston the night before. He was sitting on the couch, clearly stressed the hell out, trying his phone and running his hands through his hair. We sat there and talked about what we could do. We agreed that it was getting colder, but we also decided that, unfortunately, it was probably best to turn down the heat. If it was still this cold with the heat up so high, we didn't want to blow the heating unit while we still had power. We turned it down from 70 degrees to 55. We ate just a little leftover pizza; it seemed we all understood the need to ration our food and sat there talking things over. But there's not much you can do or talk about in that situation. We all went our separate ways, Preston to his room, Reggie stayed in the living room, and I headed up to the attic.

I found the PVC pipes I saw earlier. I took some out, measured them, and connected them. I got a ladder and climbed up to the attic window, and cautiously tried opening it. I was relieved and slightly surprised that none of the snow fell in. I reached out and touched it with my hand. 

If it wasn't so cold, and I swear it was colder than snow typically is, then it would've been really pleasant to touch. It was so soft and malleable, like marshmallow fluff. It was still snow; but it was snow I'd never seen before, and I've never seen after. I pulled the PVC pipes up to the snow and started to push it straight up. I kept twisting and pushing through the snow until I quit feeling resistance. I pulled the pipe back down and measured the section I had left. It was 7.5 feet long, and the whole pipe was 20 feet long. The snow was about 12 feet above the window. 

It wasn't too shocking after everything else that had happened, but still, I was pretty nervous at that point. If more snow fell, how long would it be before the roof caved in? How long would it be before we got out? I was thinking all this over, but then I heard something odd. It was coming from the window. I looked up and realized the pipe had made a perfect hole through the snow; I heard some odd ambient noise out of this hole. It wasn't anything that was sticking out, but it sounded electronic, almost. I took the PVC pipe down to my bathroom, used some warm water from the tub to get all the snow out of the tube, and realized we needed to winterize all the faucets. I turned my facets on a slow drip and got Reggie and Preston to do the same. If you don't put faucets on a slow drip in that kind of weather, then your pipes could freeze and bust. 

Anyway, I went back up to the attic with the pipe. I carefully pushed the pipe back up through the hole I had made, which was surprisingly not caved in. After I knew it was through the top, I put my ear up to the hole and listened. 

I could try to explain the noise in great detail, but honestly, I could fill a whole other post by just doing that. All I need to say is that you'd be most of the way there if you imagine an electronic hum mixed with a pulsing high-pitched groan, pulsing in a random and organic way. Still, there was just so much to the sound. It's not like anything was horrifying about the sound itself, I suppose, but it just felt wrong. I felt unnerved as if it were in the wrong place. Or perhaps I was in the wrong place.

I took the pipe back out and closed the window. I sat up there for a long time, thinking, trying my phone, and considering everything that could happen. I remember trying to come to terms with the reality that, given all the information I had at that time, I might starve to death or be crushed by the house caving in there. I thought about my family, how much I hadn't said to them, and about how much I hadn't accomplished. Trite, I know. But I just want to say that even though I WAS afraid to die, it felt very peaceful. Since nothing was happening at that moment and I was managing to stay calm and accept what was happening, what I thought was happening, I just remember feeling very comfortable up there at that moment. Scared, yes, but relaxed.

I eventually decided that I'd thought all I could and should about it. By the time I realized that, and by the time I was getting tired of sitting in the dusty attic, I realized it was pretty much time for bed. I went down and had a quick word with Preston and Reggie. They'd winterized their bathrooms, but they still didn't have any service. We all went to bed.

I remember that when I woke up, the clock said 12:40 am. I heard something. It wasn't the odd hum I'd heard earlier; it was a tapping sound coming from my window. I sat there frozen in bed; I was just coming off my tired-brain state, but it would've scared me even if I weren't. We were snowed entirely up to the roof; what was tapping on the window? I'd closed the curtains at this point to avoid seeing the wall of snow any longer.

Cautiously, I got up and tried to peek through the end of the curtain to see what it was. It was a bird. I switched on my light and opened the curtain slowly. It was a small bird. It was green, emerald green, all over the body, but its head was mostly yellow until there was a circle of red around its beak. Its beak was thicker and curved down, from what I remember. It just kept tapping on the glass over and over. There was a small hole behind it where it had burrowed down, around 20 feet down, through the snow. I couldn't believe it. It was shivering and flapping against the window, trying to get inside. 

I felt terrible for the little guy, but it was still freaky. I turned around to quickly get Reggie and Preston to see what they thought about it. When I touched the door knob, it was so cold that when I retracted my hand, it stuck to it painfully for a second. I tried getting a sock to turn the knob, but it wouldn't budge. It was as if the door was completely frozen. For a second, I feared that the snow had caved in through the roof, and I was completely trapped in my room, but I could still see the hall light glow through the bottom of the door. 

The bird began to tap on the glass again, more feverishly than before. I don't know what it was, but I felt so bad for it; I think the sentimentality of everything, the possibility of death, the disappearance of John, and all that I might never do, was getting to me. I barely opened the window, just enough to let the bird enter. It immediately flew over to sit on top of the open door to my closet. It was still shivering, so I got an extra blanket and put it on top of the heated blanket I had brought with me. When I went to try the door again, I heard wings fluttering. I looked back, and the bird had buried itself in the "nest" I had built for it. It closed its eyes and fell asleep. I remember feeling good about that. Like I had really done something right. I had.

I hovered my hand over the top of the door knob, still frozen. The nest was on the floor and the window was closed back now. Unfortunately, I didn't bother to close the curtains again.

When I returned to bed to try to go back to sleep, I finally looked at the clock again. It still said 12:40 am. The old analog clock on the wall said 12:40, my phone said 12:40, and the digital alarm clock I'd brought said 12:40. I may not have had service, but my phone's clock and the others were working perfectly fine before. It was all very disconcerting; I suppose none of that was immediately threatening. However, I was already under the impression that something else was going on besides just a freak snowstorm after I heard the humming. Now, with the bird, the frozen door, and the clocks crashing out on me, I could not sleep for a while. However, after about an hour, the clocks started working again.

My little friend suddenly hopped out of his nest and flew to me. I felt as frozen as the door was earlier in that moment. The bird rested itself on my chest, with me still looking down, and cried out at me, raising its wings, and finally, it pecked me on the chest. When its beak made contact with me, I felt a sudden cold rush through my whole body. Imagine the feeling of eating an Altoid and then drinking an ice-cold Sprite; now imagine you feel that through all the veins in your body. But I was able to move again. It then jumped up and flew over to my door, pecking at it after making the same dramatic cry. After all this, it just flew back to its nest, but it didn't sleep; it just sat there watching me. 

I got up and hovered my hand over the knob again, nothing. I lightly tapped it on the back of my arm, not frozen at all. It wasn't even residually cold now. I looked puzzled at my friend, but it was still just staring at me. I walked out in the hall. 

Reggie had just come out as well, and he was inspecting the lock on the door with a confused look before he saw me.

"Was your door frozen? For, like, an hour?"

"Yeah, it was."

I walked over and inspected his doorknob with him, and there was no residual cold either. Our voices attracted Preston, and he came out to talk to us.

"My door was frozen, too. Did you guys have a bird pull up to your window?"

I was shocked when Reggie confirmed, and then I did too.

"Yeah, weird, right?"

I chimed in.

"Did you two let the bird inside?"

They both gave me an odd look. Reggie chimed in first.

"I felt bad for the poor thing, but I'm not just gonna let a bird enter the cabin. Birds can carry diseases and all that. It was trying to get in the whole time my door was frozen; it only just now stopped."

"Is it still there?"

Reggie peered back at his window with a sad, concerned look.

"I hope not, but I closed the curtain, so let me check."

We all shuffled into his room. The poor thing was lying on its back when he pulled back the curtain. It had frozen to death, and it was the same species as mine. I couldn't help wondering how it hadn't frozen to death while burrowing down through the snow in the first place, but in retrospect, logic wasn't valuable at that point. Preston was the first to break the silence. 

"Damn. I mean, why didn't it just leave? A bird came to my window, and I just smacked the glass to scare it off."

"And it left?"

"Yeah, it turned around and returned from the hole it had come from. I'm not letting it shit all over my room."

"I let mine come in."

They both looked shocked. 

"Why?"

"I don't know, man; I felt bad for it."

"Is it still there?"

"Yeah, I'll show you."

We began walking towards the bedroom door, but then we heard something—a thud on the glass. We turned back around to see a thin, dark-green hand against the glass. It was thin and withered, but it didn't have veins. It had five fingers like a person's hands, but they were crooked in odd, painful-looking ways. It was almost reptilian. We all watched in silence as the hand dug down through the snow to the little tunnel where the bird had dug for itself. The hand delicately picked up the tiny corpse and pulled it back up through the snow. There were only a few seconds of silence after this before it all started. Another hand suddenly dug through and smacked against the window, and then another and another until, in just a few seconds, at least 20 different hands were slapping against the glass. Preston yelled out.

"Come on, let's get down-!"

Before he could finish that sentence, all of the hands, their numbers still growing, pushed against the glass, and it shattered open. After that, hundreds more hands flooded the room behind those originals, they went straight for Reggie.

"OH GOD!"

He tried to turn around to run, but all the hands caught him. In one horrifyingly quick and brutal movement, they picked him up and smashed and tore him apart. He only screamed for about a second. Preston and I, now covered in blood spatter and bits of organs, ran out into the hall.

Preston was ahead of me when I tripped on the hall's carpet. He managed to reach the stairs and quickly ran down them. As I was falling and taking all of this in, as best as possible in such a panicked state, I heard more windows smashing. All the hands were flooding out of Reggie and Preston's room. When I saw them all advancing upon me all I could do was scream louder than I thought I could. But they suddenly stopped when they were all only a few feet from me. I saw all of them that were closest to me suddenly freeze in such a way that it was as if they'd been plunged into liquid nitrogen. It barely seemed to faze them; the horde jumbled up, hesitating for a moment, perhaps as a reaction to the pain or in surprise, but then the injured hands in front were replaced by fresh ones, if you could have called hands that grotesque fresh.

They flew past me and plunged down the stairs, trailing behind them were impossibly long sickly arms. I heard a yelp from below, and when I was trying to get back to my feet, I saw that they were quickly retracting. They had dragged Preston back up the stairs. He was yelling in such a chilling pitch. I'll truly never forget it. I tried to move to the side to avoid the hands myself, but as Preston was being dragged back towards his room, he grabbed my ankle.

HELP ME!!!"

I fell back over and went flying off towards his room with him. However, I barely managed to catch a hold of the door frame and hold us there for a few moments.

LET GO!!!"

DON'T LET IT TAKE ME!!! PULL UP!!!"

I CAN'T, MAN, LET GO!!!"

I was slipping. God, the horror I felt when I realized I was slipping was sickening, but still, I remember realizing that the hum I heard earlier was present, and it was so much louder now. As I was losing a pinky on my grip, I saw the bird from my room fly in and perch on Preston's hand. It pecked away a few times; I heard his hands singe like the thing's hands had with me. Preston let go.

I heard his scream for only another couple of seconds before he was dragged completely back out of the room and through the snow to God knows where. Then it was quiet, I heard that same terrible hum, but everything was still now. I was trying to catch my breath, but everything got to me. I passed out. 

I don't know how long I was out for, but I guess it was an hour or two. But when I awoke, I saw everything still as it was. I was still covered in blood, the room was still a broken mess with shards of glass everywhere, and I was alone. But then I came to a little more. My friend was perched on the window and staring at me. Behind him, I saw that the snow had melted. It had melted down to the point where a thin layer of sunlight was visible through the window again. The hum was gone.

I wanted to say something to the bird, but I couldn't open my mouth. It gave me a final chirp before it hopped up, squeezed through the top of the window, and flew away. I laid there for a long time, but I realized I needed to pull some glass shards out of my skin. I got up gingerly and made my way to my room, turning my neck so I didn't have to see Reggie's room. It was fine. The window was still intact, and behind it, I could almost see the snow melting in real time. It took a while, but I managed to get all the little shards of glass out, and I washed all my wounds, as best I could, with rubbing alcohol. I just started crying and screaming. I think I threw up a little bit. I just sort of crashed out in there for a while, as best I could, without moving my injured body too much. I still get little flashes of the horror of it all sometimes, but that first reaction was the worst of it all. 

When I finally realized I couldn't just sit in there crying for the rest of the day, I got up to check my phone. It had service again, and there were lots of missed calls and bad weather advisories.

I could tell you in detail what happened afterward, but that's not important. So much happened, but I doubt it would be interesting or valuable to any of you. Police came, but they seemed pretty shaken up, too. Over the next few days, I remember going to the hospital, having lots and lots of phone calls, and realizing I was one of the few to survive. After 4 days I was back home. I remember some men in suits came and sat down with me at my apartment. They were very friendly, and they acknowledged everything that had happened, but they still loosely explained why the story just didn't work for the "public and business in general," as they put it. They had me sign for a very large check, and the story to this day is that a freak avalanche occurred and that Preston and John died on the mountain while a bear got in to attack me and Reggie. 

I think about it all sometimes. Mostly, I just try not to worry about it and move on, but it just strikes me how unfair it all was. All Reggie did was avoid getting some bird flu or something like that. And Preston was a jerk, fair enough, but he was just doing the same thing, albeit rudely. I've asked pastors and philosophers these questions, but they never seem to have the correct answer: why is it that so many people make the biggest decisions at the worst time? Why is it that people have to make a choice that decides their fate for years to come, perhaps the outlook for the rest of their lives, so often when they're at their least experienced? What if Preston was just a bit older? A bit more mature and kind? What if Reggie had just thought about it more and decided to let the bird in? Why was letting a bird come in the deciding factor? Maybe it's foolish to demand logic from such a violent and alien force, but I can't help thinking about it.

I know I might be breaking the rules of my agreement, but I'm hoping that I can avoid any legal issues by changing names and not being too specific. This may never reach the right person, but it's been good for me to tell this story, and it may help someone somewhere. You may not believe this story, but that's fine; you'll probably never have to worry about it. But if you find yourself snowed in, snowed up to the roof, and you see a bird at your window, let it in. Please just let it in.
