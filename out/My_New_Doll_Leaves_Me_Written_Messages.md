  I squeal in joy as I grab the doll not hearing my mother's protest. "Who do you think left it here?" I ask my mom. 


  My mom holds her head as she thinks then shrugs her head, "maybe they knew it was your birthday so someone rang the doorbell and dropped it to surprise you?" I look at her with a happy expression. I hug her and then quickly ran upstairs to check out my knew doll. 


  It looks like a Raggity Anne doll. With long braided hair and wearing a blue blouse. In her blue blouse I noticed that the doll has a pocket in it. I looked in it and saw that the doll has a pen and a notepad. I look at the notepad and on the first page it said:


  Hello! My name is Suzie! What's your name? 


  Now I thought that this was just a way of saying what the doll was. On the other hand though I also thought it would be fun to play a little game with it.


  My name is Mary! I'm 15 and I like to write and draw! I hope we can be friends!


  I look at my little handwritten note at the bottom of the original message. I just thought it was a bit funny since it came with the notepad. I then grabbed my phone out of my pocket and messaged Beth and Amy about my new doll. 


  I then went downstairs and asked my mom if I can go have a sleepover at Amy's and she said yes!


*****************************************


  When I went back home I went to my bedroom to put all my stuff up. We just sat around all night playing makeup and tried to tell each others fortune. 


  As I was putting away my sketchbook where I drew all of us last night at the beach.  Then I looked at the Raggity Anne on my bedside table. It looked as though the pen has been moved. Huh? Did I put it there yesterday?


  I put the pen back to where I had it the other day. Then instinctively I grabbed the notepad and turned the other page. My heart started beating. No, this can't be possible.


  On the other page there was another message:


   Yes! I hope we can be friends too! 


  I felt like I was about too faint so I sat on the head. It can't be writing messages on it's own can it? Then I started trying to think rational and my head instantly went to mom. 


  Maybe mom got me this doll to communicate with me better? Yeah that must be it. Mom got me this doll as a way to better know her teenage daughter. I smile at the thought of mom writing me a message on the notepad after I got on the bus. 


  I then grabbed the pen and wrote another message:


  What kind of things do you like to do Suzie? 


  I then put the pen down and took a shower. After I got done the pen was misplaced again with another message:


  Well Mary I like to dance, sing, and read books! You think you can read one of your books to me? 


  Oh mom. I thought as i rolled my eye's. Then something occurred to me. My mom doesn't sing and she isn't much of a reader. She does like to dance though. Whenever one of her favourite country tracks come on the radio on her phone she would grab my hand and say," dance with me Mary!" Then we would shuffle till we would get tired and we would just end up  laughing.


  We have to get to know each other a bit first how old are you? Where did you come from. 


  I then went downstairs as mom was yelling it was time to eat supper. While we were eating I asked mom if she got the doll. She then looked at me in a surprised look and starts laughing," oh sweety if i got you that doll I would've just straight up give it too you instead of being a woman of mystery."


  What she said made since to me. Whenever mom gives me a present she just gives it to me in a wrapped box. She would never give me a gift unwrapped. 


  I told her goodnight after dishes were done and i went upstairs. I immediately looked at the notepad. This time I was dissatisfied as there was no message this time. 


  I'm sorry, did I make you mad? 


  After i wrote the message I then turned over and went to bed. 


  ******************************************

  

  The next day I came home from school crying. Two girls in my class were being mean to me today saying how I don't have a father and my mother goes into other men's houses(which isn't true!) 


  So after crying on my bed for a while I looked at the notepad. Sure enough a new message:


  It's ok Mary. We are friends remember? 


  I stop sniffling and look at the message again and again. Now I know this isn't mom if I had any doubts before. 


  Then unlike all the other messages there was another one below:


  You want me to help you with all your problems? 


  I looked at the notepad. Wondering if I should pick up the pen and write down yes because of the angry thoughts in my head. Then since i didn't think this will do anything I grabbed the pen and wrote one word:


  YES


  The next day after school, one of the girls that made fun of me looked like she didn't get much sleep the other night. She wasn't even paying attention to the other one that was trying to see what was wrong with her. 


  I noticed that every time that she looked at me she looked away. I didn't think of the notepad as for this beong the cause. For all I know the doll just writes to me and can't do nothing more.


  That night before i went to bed I looked for another message and their it was.:


  You want me to take care of the other one for you? 


  At this point I was only a little bit scared. I mean, did the doll do it? Did the doll make that one girl lose sleep the other night and frightened her that badly? 


  I thought again that the other girl shouldn't be the only onw of the pair to not lose sleep. Also she needed to pay to. I wote down Yes. 


  The next day the other girl didn't go to school. I heard rumors that the parents found her missing that night. Said that the town was going to commit a search the following week. My heart dropped. Did I really cause her to go missing? No way, no way a doll could make someone disappear!


  I kept myself low that day at school incase people think that i made that girl disappear at school. 


  Whenever i got home mom was still at work. I went up to the notepad where it left a chilling message:


  We make a great team don't we?


  I was mad. I started yelling at the doll," what do you mean we make a great team! I didn't want you to make her go missing! If that's what you were doing in the first place!"


  I was ecstatic. I went into the shower to cool off. Then as I ran a towel down through my hair I actually thought of making a apology message to the doll. 


  I went back into my bedroom and saw another message. One that made me shiver all the way down my spine. 


  I didn't mean us Mary. I was talking about my brother. 


  I then felt something behind me like someone is crawling out from underneath my bed. Then I felt a big hand grabbed my leg as i screamed and stomped on it. 


  I am now in my bathroom. I called the police and my mom. I don't know how long I'll make it. He is banging on the door hard. I'm screaming at the person to please stop. But the banging continues.
