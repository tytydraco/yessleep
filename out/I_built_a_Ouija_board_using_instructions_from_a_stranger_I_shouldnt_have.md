The envelope came on a Wednesday. No stamp. No return address. Just slid through the mail slot like junk flyers.

Inside was a single sheet of thick paper covered in diagrams. At the center, a circle shaded pitch-black. Around it, markings I didn’t recognize. At the bottom, one line of text:

“Follow exactly. Do not improvise.”

I should’ve thrown it away. But the diagrams looked like blueprints for a Ouija board—not the toy-store kind. Something older.

That night I built it. Burned the symbols into wood with a soldering iron, painted the black sun in the middle. My hands worked like they weren’t even mine.

When I set the planchette down, it twitched before I touched it. A sharp scrape against the wood.

The first word it spelled was: HELLO.

My stomach flipped. I’d used Ouija boards before, but this was different—too quick, too precise.

I whispered, “Who are you?”

It spelled: KANE.

The TV in the corner clicked on by itself—static hissing through the speakers. The noise wasn’t random; it had rhythm, like chanting buried under the signal.

The planchette moved again: BUILD MORE.

Then it dragged itself so hard across the board that it carved a groove into the wood—a perfect black circle, like an eclipse.

And I saw it, not with my eyes but inside my head: a sun that gave no light, a disc of absolute darkness, and something vast shifting behind it.

I tried to smash the board. Snapped it clean in two.

When I looked down, it was whole again. The black sun in the center pulsed once, like a heartbeat.

The planchette spelled one last word: 
APPRENTICE.

It’s been a week since that night. I wrapped the board in a tarp and locked it in the trunk of my car. I thought that would be enough.

The first text came Thursday evening—no number, no name, just the letter K.

TRACE COMPLETED. AWAITING NEXT APPRENTICE.

At first I thought it was a prank. Then another message arrived with a photo attached.

My desk. My chair. The same burn mark from when I built the board.

Except the board wasn’t there. Only its shadow.

When I checked in real life, the desk was empty—but the air smelled faintly of smoke.

A third message followed: DO YOU STILL HEAR IT?

I didn’t answer. But the hum had started again—a low, steady beat, like a heartbeat under the floor.

Finally I texted back: What is this?

Instant reply: GOOD. THEN YOU’RE STILL LISTENING.

The phone flashed white, then black. Every light in the room dimmed with the vibration in my chest.

A new file appeared on my screen: design_002.jpg.

I opened it.

A circular diagram glowed faintly, symbols shifting as if alive. At the center, a line of text:

“For the continuation of light through shadow.”

My phone began to hum louder and louder, until I had to drop it. The lights went out.

In the black glass of the screen, my reflection stared back.

Behind me, a second shape—

a dark circle, pulsing like a heartbeat.
