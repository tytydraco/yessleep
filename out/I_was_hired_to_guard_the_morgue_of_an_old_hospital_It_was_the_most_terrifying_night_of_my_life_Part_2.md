“Anthony, come in, over!”

  
For a moment, I ignored the call from the radio, instead focusing on the smiling face of the beautiful blonde currently filling the screen as I absentmindedly sipped my coffee. Then I pushed back from the table, setting the mug down next to the coffee pot and grabbing the device from my belt as I muted the movie. Thumbing the transmit button, I cleared my throat and spoke.

  
“Anthony here. What’s up, Bernard?”

  
The deep, gravelly voice of the older man immediately answered, filtering out with an almost amusing tininess from the speaker. “Just quickly checking in, where we’re coming up to the halfway point of the night. How’re things going down there?” I gave a quick glance around the break room before answering. “Seems to be going okay up to this point” I answered. “No disturbances to speak of, and I’ve been keeping to a schedule of rounds every twenty to thirty minutes” I paused for a moment before finishing. “And no more statue moments, either. I know you were wondering” Bernard’s laugh caused the radio’s speaker to vibrate and distort a little. “Hey, after that freakin’ creepy moment, can you blame me? What about movies? Have you checked any in the cabinet out yet?” I glanced at the film silently continuing along its plot. “Yeah. I’m currently halfway through an old 50s comedy called *An Alligator named Daisy*. Pretty amusing, but you seriously tell me who’s nuts enough to have a damn alligator for a pet!”

  
Bernard laughed again. “My friend, you’d be shocked if you knew half of the stuff that was gotten up to in the old days. The tales I’ve heard would curl your toes! But that is a good movie; 1954, I believe” Then he cleared his throat. “Look, I’ve got about an hour and a half before my next break. Soon as I do, I’ll be coming down in the elevator to give you a bit of company. Until then, just keep doing what you’re doing, and six AM will be here before you know it!” And with that, he clicked off.

  
I replaced the radio on my belt, then quickly glanced at my wristwatch. The two hands stood almost dead-on vertically, indicating that it was just about to hit midnight. "Well, I’ve made it close to four hours" *Six hours to go, and then I can drive home and crash. At least no more weird or freaky things have happened*. I grimaced at the last thought, having just spent the last few hours doing a rather decent job of pushing the hair raising moment from my memory. But, try as hard as I might, the thought caused the mental image of the cold storage locker opening to swim forward in my mind. Along with the blood curdling voice which had whispered my name from inside.

  
*Anthonyyy…*

  
I shook my head aggressively. *Fuck off with scaring the bejeezus out of yourself, man. You almost ruined everything the first time. Like hell it’s happening again*. Softly, I repeated the phrase I had hours before. “There’s nothing down here. Only me” The muted sound of my voice reassured me some, and I gave my body a little shake as I reached out and paused the movie before glancing again at my watch.

  
“Well, time for another patrol”

  
Pulling my coat on, I zipped it up before opening the break room door and stepped out into the hallway. I felt goose pimples run along my arms at the chill, even under the heavy fabric. If things go my way and I get a longer position here, I’m gonna have to invest in a heavier jacket than this. Maybe one of those winter parkas. Walking down the corridor, I opened up each door and quickly peered into the rooms before continuing on. I reached the main autopsy room and pushed open the door, peering in at the metal table and tray of equipment. I involuntarily shuddered as I imagined a body lying on it, its chest opened up as the coroner worked to discover the cause of death. “Probably the only good thing about dying is that I won’t have to see that done to myself” I muttered. Closing the door, I began to walk towards the stairs to the lower level. As I did, my ears pricked up as I focused on the music softly filling the entire building.

  
Like all the others I’d heard tonight, this, too was an easy listening, instrumental song. But I recognized the light, bouncy tune: *Stagione Vivaldiana* by Giancarlo Gazzani. *Mom used to play it all the time growing up. I haven’t heard it in years*. I’d decided after the first hour that I didn’t totally hate it constantly playing and repeating the same dozen or so selections. If anything, it actually seemed to shoo away some of the eerie feelings the morgue gave off, the same way a night light banishes away a child’s imaginary monster. I gave my head another little shake, realizing I was just standing at the head of the stairs and stalling. As much as I’d convinced myself that I’d hallucinated the entire ordeal, a small, insistent part of me kept trying to argue that I hadn’t every time I had to head downstairs.

  
“Just get it over with, man”

  
Taking a deep breath, I quickly descended the steps and turned, following the corridor and humming along with the song until I reached the door for the cold storage room. *Don’t be a pussy; open the damn door. The quicker you get this done, the quicker you can get back upstairs*. “Right” I whispered, before gripping the handle and turning. Reaching around the doorway, I flicked the light switch and stepped inside, closing the door behind me. Sparing a glance around, I saw nothing looked out of place; to my relief, I also noticed that all of the freezer doors were securely shut. They had been the last seven times I’d walked through as well, and the sight once again helped shush the small voice in the back of my mind. Crossing the room, I opened the door and stepped into the storage room. Unclipping my flashlight, I lightly tapped the long cylinder against the metal shelves lining the room as I crossed it: it was something random I’d done everywhere I’d worked, though I couldn’t for the life of me remember why I’d started. Reaching the exit door, I took another deep breath and opened it, revealing the long corridor beyond.

  
Stepping through, I quickly closed the door behind me as I remembered Bernard’s words about there being a camera in here somewhere. Then, flicking the light on, I began to head for the far end. Unlike the rest of the building, no music played here, so the only sounds I heard were the rapping of my boots on the concrete, and the soft hissing of the pipes. As I continued, I stopped to jiggle the handle of each door set into their respective alcove. With each small shudder that indicated it was firmly locked, my stride increased. Soon enough, I reached the elevator doors up to the hospital, and feeling pleased with myself, I turned around and began enthusiastically heading back. All done for the next half hour; now, back to the movie! I began to softly hum *Stagione Vivaldiana* to myself again, allowing a small smile to play across my lips.

  
That’s when I felt the breath on the back of my neck.

  
There had been times when I’d patrolled the corridor before that one of the sprays of steam had hit me as I’d passed a leak; each time they’d happened, I’d grimaced at the burning sensation on my face and neck, wondering if I should say something to Dr. Carter about the potential hazard at the end of my shift. But this? This was most definitely *not* that. Especially because it’d never been accompanied before by a sudden, rancid stench which burned my nostrils. 

Or the unmistakable feeling of someone standing close behind.

  
Eyes going wide, I whirled around, ready to club any intruder over the head with the flashlight-

  
\-To see nothing but an empty hallway behind me. For a few moments, my eyes darted around in their sockets, flicking from one side of the hall to the other. I’d only gone a handful of steps from the elevator, and the nearest door was roughly fifteen feet in front of me. Nowhere for anyone to duck into. And because the pipes were flush against the wall, it meant there wasn’t a space for someone to hide, either. *What…the hell?* I stood there for a moment longer, then shook my head. *This corridor plays tricks on your mind, man. Maybe it’s from the oppressive silence compared to the morgue, or the cold, industrial feel it has; whatever it is, I absolutely fucking hate it*. Forcing myself to turn back around, I cast a final, quick glance over my shoulder before beginning to walk back the way I’d come at a rapid pace. “Honestly, I think I’m going to extend my patrols in here from every round, to every *other* round” I whispered. If Bernard or Dr. Carter had anything to say about it, I’d deal with it in the morning.

  
Continuing on, I flashed my light at the doors I’d already tried as I passed them. The first three were exactly the same as they had been a minute ago, solidly closed and no doubt locked. But as I approached the fourth alcove, my gait slowed as something registered in my head. *Wait a minute…why does it seem darker than before? More to the point, why can’t I see the handle glinting off the light opposite it?* I felt puzzlement fill me as I took a few steps closer. Then it clicked. The door was open. It had swung inwards, disappearing out of sight into the darkness that filled…whatever lay beyond. I stared blankly at the blackness as I struggled to understand. *There’s no freakin’ way. That door has been solidly locked every single time I’ve tried it. Now all of a sudden, it, what? Gave up the ghost? No way.* I felt my muscles tense up as trepidation began to pile itself into my body. Slowly, the hand that didn’t hold the flashlight fell to the holster on my belt, my fingers beginning to pop it loose as I took a slow, decisive step forward.

  
By the time I’d halved the distance to it, the Beretta was out of its holster, gripped in a hand that had developed a small shake. The fact that I’d never had to draw it before made the situation even tenser. My breath came shallow and quick as I felt my heartbeat begin to speed up. I couldn’t understand why, but every step I took towards the open door, the feeling I’d had in cold storage slowly began to rear its head again. It was as if every primal instinct in me was screaming to get away, to dash like a madman back to the morgue. But I knew I had a job to do. And so I forced it away, finally opening my mouth and speaking with an even, commanding tone that I didn’t feel in the slightest. “If anyone’s in there, come on out!” Nobody answered my call, as I expected. What I *didn’t* expect, however, was to out of nowhere be hit with two simultaneous sensations. The first, was a sudden, frigid blast of air far colder than I’d felt before down here.

  
The second was an intense, inexplicable feeling of dread.

  
It overtook me so quickly that I audibly gasped. Exploding into motion on pure instinct, I swung around the door, snapping up my light and gun to point inside-

  
\-At nothing. Just like with the breath on my neck, I was rewarded with a view of nobody standing in the blackness. This time, the annoyance I’d felt by the elevator doors flared immediately. “For fuck’s sake, Anthony, now this is getting ridiculous. You’re jumping at literal fucking shadows. I thought you were braver than this” A wave of embarrassment immediately washed over me as I returned my gun to its holster, and I stepped forward, shining my light around. The door opened into some sort of maintenance room. A workbench sat on the left side; logbooks and tools were heaped haphazardly upon it with all the carelessness of a five-year-old. Shelves lined the other wall, where I saw boxes of light bulbs, fuses and other spare parts stacked on top of each other. Aiming the light further inside revealed that the room wasn’t too deep, either; the beam reflected off the concrete wall less than fifteen feet beyond. I allowed myself a small chuckle at my frayed nerves and turned to leave. But I paused as I heard the ding of the elevator sound from out in the corridor. Instantly, I realized it had to be Bernard coming down to check on me. *Wait until I tell him about this bullcrap*. A smile began to form on my face at the thought.

  
But it was wiped away as the sound of multiple voices filled the corridor.

  
Any relief I’d felt was washed away like water down the drain, replaced with a mixture of shock and trepidation. *The fuck…who the hell is that?* The slapping sound of shoes on concrete began filtering down to me, but the voices remained low, hushed. Almost as if they didn’t want to be heard. My hand flew down to the still unsnapped holster, my fingers settling around the butt of my gun. Then, as the sounds drew closer, I began to distinguish individual words. “Dude, this is absolutely insane. I know my old man works here, but this is beyond anything we’ve done before. This isn’t just breaking the rules, it’s breaking the *law*!” A second voice piped up. “Stop being such a wuss, Mikey! Remember, you were the one who accepted the dare from Skinner. You were the one who put the twenty bucks down on it” The first voice spoke again. “Yeah, but that was before I realized what we truly were getting ourselves into. I’m already debating calling this off and just giving Skinner back the money”

  
As the voices began to argue amongst themselves, joined in by a third voice, it suddenly clicked. *Teenagers. Fucking trespassing teenagers*. Whatever wariness I’d had melted away like butter in a frying pan, replaced with a sudden wave of annoyance. *I know the rumors always persist, but don’t these kids have anything better to do than break in. And more to the point, how did they manage to sneak by Bernard?* The thought suddenly jolted the man’s words back in my mind about immediately reporting any activity to him instead of being a hero. But I mentally counter-argued that, because it was just teens, I could handle them myself. Once I got my hands on them, *then* I would call Bernard to get his ass down here. Feeling a small wave of satisfaction pass through me at the mental image of presenting the three to upstairs, I clicked off my flashlight, allowing the darkness to consume me. I stood, not moving a muscle and breathing as softly as I could as the voices grew louder.

  
The arguing rose to a fever pitch as I realized they were about to pass the open door. I felt one corner of my mouth rise slightly in a smirk. *This is gonna be rich*. I raised the light, my finger hovering over the button. Exactly as I predicted, three figures, their features slightly hidden by the light they blocked out stepped into view.

  
I snapped the light on, yelling at the same time. “Freeze!”

  
For a split second, I caught the shocked expressions adorning what had to be teenage boys no older than sixteen or seventeen as they whirled to face me. Then they were gone, an explosion of movement and noise as they began to dash down the corridor. Not back towards the elevator, though; towards the morgue. I sprinted out of my hiding place, catching a glimpse of the teen’s backs as they hauled ass away from me. “Man, I thought you said nobody guarded the place down here!” I heard one yell. “I swear to God, nobody ever *has* before!” the first voice screamed back. I interjected myself into their shouting match. “You three’ve got nowhere to go; stop running and it’ll go easier on you!” A third voice shouted back to me. “Fuck you, man! Hurry guys, there’s a way out through here!” A loud, metallic *bang* thundered through the corridor as I saw the first teen reach the door to the morgue, shouldering it open and turning to flip me the bird as the others raced inside. Then he slammed it shut with another crash.

  
I continued to race towards the door, now feeling thoroughly pissed off as I pumped my legs faster. *Okay, these little shit’s are grass, and I’m the fucking lawn mower!* Reaching out with my free hand, I snatched the handle and twisted it, using my own momentum to dash into the storage room. As soon as I was through, I flung it closed behind me, slamming my back into the metal as I took a second to catch my breath. I could take all the time I needed to center myself; the upstairs door to the outside was locked, meaning they had no way to get out. Obviously, they had thought otherwise. But as I stood up straight and attempted to catch some hint of where they’d gone, I realized that, aside from the music, it had gone dead silent. I strained my ears, but all I could hear was an instrumental, muzak version of *The Air that I Breathe*. Nothing more. *Shit*.

  
It was time to radio for backup. I reached down and unclipped it from my belt, jamming down on the transmit button a little harder than I had to. “Bernard, come in, over! We’ve got a bit of a situation down here!” For a few moments, the only thing that greeted me was static, and I wondered if I’d accidentally switched channels. Then, his voice filtered out. “Bernard here. What’s going on down there?” I took a deep breath before answering. “I was doing my rounds when I heard the elevator ding. I thought it was you for a second, until I heard voices. Three teenage boys who somehow made it past you and down here. I tried confronting them, but they ran into the morgue. Now, they’re hiding in here somewhere.”

  
Another spell of silence. Then I heard Bernard groan. “For the love of Pete, not again. How the *hell* did they manage to get past me? I’m on my way to you; I’ll be less than five minutes. Just stay by the door to the corridor so they can’t get back out, and we’ll flush ‘em out together” And with that, he clicked off. I was left alone, with only the music to keep me company. In my head, I could picture the big man thundering through the hospital corridors above, an infuriated look on his face. The thought made me snort slightly. Then I bent over slightly, putting my hands on my knees as I continued to catch my breath. I’m not terribly out of shape for my age, but thanks to everything, I hadn’t exactly been able to hit a gym recently, and it showed. *Whatever. It doesn’t matter. Just do like he said, and guard this door. There’s nowhere they can go*.

  
As I stood back up straight, I suddenly became aware of a new sound filtering down to me from the upper level: laughter.

  
I could distinctly hear the three teens laughing their asses off, as though they’d just committed the most hilarious prank in the world. And as I listened to it, I felt my blood begin to boil, because just by the mocking tone it held, I could tell they were laughing about me. Growing up, I’d been the scrawny, shy, nerdy boy with glasses and as a result, had been picked on quite a bit. It had continued throughout middle and high school, and even years later, after trading my glasses in for contacts and bulking up, the bitter sting still twisted inside. My head was suddenly awash with every bully I’d dealt with in my youth as I continued to hear them screech with laughter, and my temper suddenly flared up. Bernard’s words about staying put flashed quickly through my head, but I practically flung them out the window of my mind as I began advancing on the door to cold storage.

  
*Laugh at me, will you, you little fucks? You won’t be in a minute*.

  
Attempting to be as quiet as possible, I gripped the handle and twisted, sliding into the metallic room. I felt a vague wave of discomfort and unease from the earlier encounter as I took a few steps across, but it was dulled by the anger filling me like magma in a volcano. I didn’t look to either side of me as I finished crossing the room and yanked the door open. This time, as I stepped through, I deliberately slammed the door behind me, momentarily overwhelming the music, which had changed to a rendition of Engelbert Humperdinck’s *After the Lovin’*. Instantly, I heard the teens shush each other from somewhere up the stairs, though one still let out a muffled chuckle. I marched down the corridor until I reached the bottom of the stairs, staring up. Nothing moved, and now *all* I could hear was the music and the soft buzzing of the lights.

  
Taking a deep breath and attempting to reel in my temper somewhat, I called out in as calm and authorative a tone as I could muster. “Okay, listen up, you three! I’m sure by now you’ve realized the door to the outside up there is locked, meaning you’ve got no way out in that direction. And there’s no way past me. So, I’ll make you guys a deal. You come out now, and I’ll talk to my partner and see if we can’t just let you go without a fuss. No cops called, no marks on your permanent records. What’dya say?” There was no response, and as the seconds ticked by. I was just about to try again when the snickering began. It was soft, almost inaudible over the speakers, but loud enough I could distinguish it. Three sets of snickering. I felt my anger begin to flare up again at the blatant disrespect being shown. I shouted up again. “If I have to come up there and search for you, it’s not gonna end well for you at all!”

  
The snickering intensified at my words; I thought I caught a bit of a whisper, something that included the words “Dumbass rent-a-cop”. That did it; I felt the rage bubble over and, gripping the railing so tightly that my knuckles began to turn white, I began up the stairs. “Fine, have it your way, fuckheads!” The muffled laughter continued, putting more and more anger behind every step I took. Then, it stopped altogether as I reached the head of the stairs. Breathing heavily, I swung my gaze over the hallway. All of the doors along it were closed, exactly as I’d left them. But I’d expected this; the kids weren’t stupid enough to give a clear indicator of where they’d hid. So, deciding to be methodical about my search, I began with the door closest, the main autopsy room. Opening it, I glanced around. It looked as empty as before. Glancing quickly at the rest of the doors, I ducked inside and poked around, moving any potential hiding spots away from the walls.

  
Confident nobody was in there, I walked back out in the hallway. *Four doors left. Running out of room, guys*. I walked to the next two doors and opened it, repeating the same process I had before. The next room was the break room, and I gripped the handle a little tighter before shoving it open. The room looked exactly as I’d left it. The movie was still paused, the screen filled with the beautiful face of the actress laughing. For a split second, it made some of the rage I felt drift away as I took a step into the room, and I felt my muscles begin to relax. *This is absolutely ridiculous, Anthony. You’re up here hunting for these kids like a damn serial killer, feeling like you’re a hair’s breadth away from beating the shit out of them, and all they’ve done is what you used to as a teen; disrespect authority and do dumb shit for laughs*.

  
I was on the verge of simply turning around and heading back down the stairs to wait by the door like I’d been asked, when the snickering came again.

  
And this time, I instantly knew where it came from. The walls between the rooms weren’t that thick, meaning any noise on the other side could pass through easily. And it was clear as day, that it was coming from the final room in the hallway. Instantly, the rational side of my brain disappeared again as I again heard snippets of whispers, including a choice remark about me that included a specific word which once meant a simple bundle of sticks. I began to see red as I strode out into the hallway again, all subtext of stealth gone as I allowed my boots to rap loudly on the tile. The snickering grew louder as I approached the door; it was one I knew led only to a tiny storage closet filled with cleaning chemicals. The dumbest place anyone could have chosen to hide. I reached out and gripped the handle with a hand that shook with anger. *I’ve got you now, you little fucksticks*.

   
As a snicker from the other side of the door began, I exploded into motion, twisting the handle and yanking the door open as I snapped on the flashlight-

  
\-And felt dumbfounded at what I saw. The rage I’d been feeling instantly evaporated, replaced by a rising wave of shock.

  
The closet was empty. All my light reflected off of was a broom, a mop in a bucket, and a few shelves of spray bottles and rags. Nothing else. I felt my jaw drop open as I continued to stare into the confined space, my mind unable to comprehend anything. *That’s…dude, that’s fucking impossible. I searched every other room up here, and they all were empty. More to the damn point, I freaking HEARD them snickering to each other from the other side of the door. I HEARD them. This makes no fucking sense…what the absolute hell...* I took a step backwards, feeling a shiver race up my spine as the shock began to contort into something more akin to how I felt staring into the open locker downstairs. My head swiveled around like an owl as another shiver tore through me. I whispered softly to myself, my voice sounding insignificant and powerless in the hall. “Something…something’s not right here. I think, I think it’s time to go back down and wait for Bernard” I turned to quickly walk back to the stairs.

  
That was when the lights went out.

  
I was plunged into darkness, almost letting out a scream as it enveloped me. I froze like a statue, for a moment forgetting about the flashlight in my hands as the primitive side of my brain screamed that I could no longer see. Then, getting ahold of myself, I fumbled for the button. The powerful white beam sprang out, illuminating the hall ahead of me. As I felt my heartbeat slow a tiny bit, I suddenly realized two thing simultaneously. The first was that the music had not stopped with the lights going out. Far from helping me relax, it instead made it worse. *This isn’t any form of power outage; if it was, the music would’ve stopped as well*. That was when I realized what had begun playing: for the first time since the lobby, *Beautiful Dreamer* had begun to play again. Another cascade of shivers rolled up my spine as the song continued.

  
The second was that I realized that not all the lights had gone out.

  
The bright shaft of light spilled out from an open doorway near the end of the hallway. For a moment, I couldn’t place what room it was. *It’s too far down to be the break room. And none of the small rooms had bright ceiling lights, only the-*

  
The realization smacked into me like an out-of-control truck, along with the biggest chill yet. The light was coming from the autopsy room. I was no longer simply creeped out or unnerved; I was full out terrified. Feeling paranoia the likes I’d never had before sweep through me, I swung around wildly, aiming my flashlight behind me as I suddenly felt convinced someone was behind me. But nobody stood there. I looked back to the lit-up doorway. Every fiber of my being was screaming at me to stay away from it. But I knew if I wanted to try and make a bolt for the stairs, I’d *have* to pass by it. So, steeling myself, and feeling my heart began to thunder in my chest, I began to walk towards it.

 The music continued as I tried to step as quietly as I could, and I realized with another chill that the sinister ambience it’d held as I looked up in the lobby was back. Still, I kept moving, telling myself that as soon as I passed by it, I would run. I drew even with the light, stopping for a moment in the dark as I drew in all the breath I could. *Now or never, Tony*. I began to speed walk past the doorway, telling myself that I wouldn’t look inside. But, to this day, I can’t understand why, it felt as though I were *compelled* to look.

  
And what I saw froze me to the spot.

  
There was a body lying on the autopsy table. From this angle, I couldn’t see the corpse’s face. But it was unmistakably a body. One that hadn’t been there before. I could even see the toe-tag dangling from its feet. My eyes went wide as I felt my breath hitch in my throat. Then I forced myself to whisper, my voice coming out shaky and hoarse. “…The *fuck*?!”

  
I didn’t expect anything to answer my whisper. I only even said it out loud from the shock of seeing the corpse, of the terror of the entire situation.

  
But something *did*.

  
“*Hey, four-eyes*”

  
The whisper from just off to my right made the blood in my veins turn to ice. I began to hyperventilate as terror consumed me. Slowly, I turned to aim my light back down the corridor-

  
\-Where it reflected off three faces, each splattered with blood as purely evil grins stretched across their faces.

  
A scream louder than any I had ever made erupted from my lips as I began backpedaling towards the stairs as fast as I could. Any logical thought raced away in my mind, instead being replaced with the single, repeating one that screamed I needed to get away. I kept racing back, almost tripping over my own feet as the three grinning faces began to advance on me.

  
The next thing I remember, was being shaken roughly back to consciousness.

  
“Anthony!” The voice was faint at first, but as I slowly opened my eyes, it roared into my ears. I blinked a few times, only seeing blurry shapes at first. Then I heard the voice speak again, this time with obvious relief. “He’s coming round” A second voice answered it, one filled with equal amounts of relief. “Thank God; I was afraid for the worst” Blinking more, I suddenly realized I was lying against a wall, staring back at the stairs to the upper level. I also became aware of the two figures kneeling beside me. “B-Bernard? Dr. Carter?” Bernard let out a deep sigh as Dr. Carter reached for something in his pocket. A bright light clicked on, and I tried to move my head away. “Easy, son”, he said, gently pulling my head back towards him; “I just want to see if you have a concussion. Don’t try and fight me.” Even though the light felt like daggers being shot in my eyes, I allowed him to shine it. After a moment, he clicked it off.

  
“Doesn’t look like he has a concussion, thankfully. It just seems he was knocked unconscious” He stood up, offering me a hand to help me to my feet. Still feeling groggy, I took it, allowing him to pull me up. Bernard gave me a hard look. “What the hell happened? I thought I told you to wait by the door for me? Did they attack you?” I attempted to find my voice as the horrifying images of the darkness, the body on the table, and the blood-stained, grinning cadavers flooded into my mind. Almost instantly, I wanted to bolt from their grip and the morgue for the elevator. But I restrained myself. I knew if I told them what I’d seen, they would think I’d damaged my brain, or simply hallucinated, like Bernard had said I had before. *But…did I really see those things? Or did those teens knock me out, and I had a nightmare while unconscious?*

  
As much as part of me was convinced that I hadn’t, that it had been real, I couldn’t fully shake away the tiny, logical voice that kept repeating that what I thought I’d seen had been impossible. *Dead bodies don’t spontaneously appear out of nowhere. And, as horrifying as it was…three grinning visages of death aren’t things that are real*. The logic was sound. And on top of those thoughts, the idea of being dismissed without being paid, and dealing with the ire of my landlord from not being paid in full another month weighed heavily on my mind. So, I lied. “I…I don’t know”, I muttered softly, “I honestly can’t remember.”

  
Dr. Carter put a hand on my shoulder, looking at Bernard. “They must’ve really done a number on him, maybe even threw him down the stairs. Hitting his head might have caused temporary memory loss; I’ve seen it happen before.” He sighed, looking at me. “Anthony, besides that, how do you feel? Do you feel sick? Dizzy?” I shook my head. Bernard appeared in my line of sight, exchanging a look with the doctor. “Maybe I should stay down here with him the rest of the shift tonight, sir”, he began, “If he wants to stay, I mean. There’s no way in knowing if those kids will try and come back, and it’s been quiet upstairs all night”

  
They both turned to look at me. “Anthony?” Dr. Carter asked. It was a single word that was laced with more; I knew it was prompting me to say whether I felt up to finishing my shift. Part of me screamed inside. *They’re giving you an out, take it!* But I forced it away. I nodded. “I’ll stay, but, I truly would appreciate it if Bernard did stay down here the rest of the shift. Especially with my memory being a little wonky.”

  
They both nodded at my words, Bernard, turning away as Dr. Carter flashed me a smile. “I’m honestly very impressed by your resolve to stay after such a harrowing experience, son”, he said, “I think we did pick the right man for the job” The compliment made me stand up a little straighter, some of the images and thoughts disappearing from my mind. “Thank you, sir” I said. Bernard turned back to me. “Alright kid, just give me a few minutes to run back upstairs and grab a few things, and I’ll stick by you tonight. You’ve earned that much.”   


Together, they helped me back up the stairs and to the break room, where they sat me on the couch. “Just stay here until I get back” Bernard said, before leaving the room. Dr. Carter looked down at me as he moved for the door. “You sure you’re alright, son?” he asked. I nodded, again mentally fighting off the images of the nightmarish sights which refused to leave my mind. “I’ll be fine.” He smiled, before replacing the mask over his face and standing up. “Then, I’ll hopefully be seeing you at dawn to see you off, hopefully in one piece!” I couldn’t help but snort at the man’s joke as the door closed behind him.  


Reaching behind my head, I gingerly touched where I felt it beginning to throb. The dull ache flared up into a piercing pain, and I quickly pulled my hand away. *Yep, that’s gonna leave a mark for a while*. To this day, I still have a faint scar on the back on my head from it.  


I leaned back into the couch, closing my eyes as, now alone again, I was able to think. Think about the horrifying things I’d seen. Every time they came back, I felt my body become overcome with chills. I knew I’d see those grinning visages in my nightmares for months to come. But I still couldn’t figure out something. *Even if it was nothing more than a nightmare, why did that one cadaver call me four-eyes? I haven’t worn glasses in years, and aside from thinking about it a little bit ago, it’s never come up, to myself, or spoken about to anyone. So, why did it call me that?* Another thought entered, this one more down to earth. *Something was off about those teens. I didn’t think much about it at the time, but…I swear their clothes were weird. They looked…old fashioned. More like stuff you’d see in pictures from decades ago than what teens wear now.*  


I shook my head gently. There wasn’t any use pondering things I’d likely never get the answers to now. I needed to try and relax until Bernard came back.  


As I lay there, I suddenly became aware that a new song had started to play over the speakers. Unlike the repeated playlist of the last few hours, this was a song which hadn’t played before. Even still, though, I recognized the tune. An instrumental rendition of an old 70s song by a group called The Carpenters. The title flicked into my head.  


*We’ve Only Just Begun*.
