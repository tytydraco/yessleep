For this to make any sense at all, what little it does, you need to read my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12pjzme/ive_been_stuck_in_an_airplane_for_the_past_5/)

It seems like one of the comments was right, the boy finally looked up at me, his glowing green eyes they seemed to stare right into my soul, he had a giant grin, almost like something had snapped in his head, his hand reaching for me in a jerking almost glitching kind of way,  and then he lunged right at me faster than I’ve seen anyone else be able to, that sent my heart racing and my legs sprung right into action, I just ran and needed to hide somewhere, the only place I could find to hide was a bathroom stall, I locked the door and held the door handle tight.

There was a lot of frantic scratching and banging on the door for about 20 minutes straight, it seemed like he would never go away. I waited for a while to make sure that he had definitely gone away before I could let go of the door handle, my hands were shaking so badly, and my forehead was dripping with sweat from the very sudden sprint, so I felt like I needed to wash my face off, I tried turning on the tap and only a little bit of water came out, just enough for me to catch it in my cupped hands, I splashed my face with the cold water and it felt really nice, however when I looked in the mirror I saw just for a second a horrific version of myself, skin hanging off my ripped up face, blood seeping from the deep scratches, and hair seemed to had been ripped out with pieces of skin from my scalp, my reflection almost seemed to be caught mid scream.. I jerked and took a hasty half step back being so caught off guard, I blinked a few times and my reflection had returned to normal “what the living hell was that !?” I almost said out loud before I realized I should probably be quiet.

I looked around in the bathroom, I almost accidentally scared myself again with the reflection from the screen of my phone, there is something weird on top of the toilet, almost looks like ash, it doesn’t have any particular smell though, well, except for the usual smell here, but I think my nose is starting to get used to it, it doesn’t seem like it smells as bad as when I woke up, when was that again ? 2pm ? The clock on my phone said that it was 4pm… it really didn’t feel that long since the last post, I decided to open the bathroom door and take a peek out in the hall, all clear it seems, so I snuck back out again, I felt a sudden urge to try the emergency doors, so I snuck up to the one over the left wing and tried the handle, it wouldn’t budge an inch, it was also a bit slimy and somehow seemed rusty ? How is that even possible ? In pure frustration I decided to kick the door a few times, that only resulted in a dull response from it..

I slowly made my way back to the rear of the plane again, just listening for any noise since he might’ve heard my kicks, damn that was a stupid idea, being hyper aware though I started hearing the scratching noise again, it almost sounds like nails being dragged across a wooden door of some sort, I was keeping my eyes out for the boy, luckily he seemed to have disappeared into thin air because I couldn’t see him anywhere, but that meant that I could make my way all the way back to the kitchen area, I thought I could find something there to help me break open the door to the cockpit, I needed to know if I can get this plane down, or even better, find someone who could tell me what’s going on, but I was also afraid that the noise I would make in order to break down that door would catch the attention of the boy, and that he would attack me again.

I frantically searched through the cabinets, the fridge, the freezer, everything, there was just plastic sporks and knifes… just useless stuff, oh and rotting food of course, whatever was going on was acting quick on biological things, though in one of the last cabinets I searched there was a small hatch, just barely big enough for me to fit through, but it was quite heavy to lift despite its small size.

Since I didn’t want to risk staying here where the crazy boy is, and I can’t seem to find anything useful here I might as well risk going down the hatch. I carefully leaned in to take a look, shone the flashlight from my phone down there, I didn’t see much more than the checked in bags when I suddenly felt myself being pushed, I lost my balance and fell down head first…

When I came to, things seemed a bit blurry, I stood up and looked around, I was definitely in the cargo/baggage hold or whatever they call this area, there was bags and containers strewn out all over the place, the mold had affected this place too, but it looked kind of different, more shiny ? Glittery ? Radiant ? It almost looked pretty, if it wasn’t for the fact that blood seemed to drip through the upper floor down here, or wait, no, the walls were definitely covered in blood, but it wasn’t from upstairs, it came from inside here, I could hear the scratching now again, this time a lot louder, it made the tiny hairs on the back of my neck stand up, and then I felt it.. a hot warm breath on my neck, and heard a low growl, but when I turned around there was nothing there.. more than… is that Kim ? Oh my god that is Kim, I got to get her some help or something, tears rolling down my chins as I walk up to her, her limbs are missing, they look torn off like something had just pulled on them till they let go, she is bleeding a lot and she is looking pale in her face, but her lips are moving, I’m trying to listen to what she’s saying, but she’s talking slow “W-A-K-E-U-P!” that’s all she said when everything suddenly went dark.

I woke up again laying on the floor of the cargo area, I must’ve hit my head so hard that I passed out, and the last thing I can remember was the hatch slamming shut and hearing something being dragged on the floor above, my head and neck hurts really bad, I have tried opening the hatch again but it requires much more strength to open than I have right now, and what’s worse is, I now know where the missing passengers are, they are down here, in a big pile of slowly drying and rotting flesh, it’s really cold here as well and my phone is at 13% now.. I don’t think I’m going to make it out of here, I’m really scared..
