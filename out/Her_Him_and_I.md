It was just another Monday. There used to be a time when I actually looked forward to Mondays, but not anymore. Still, there was a reason I showed up early to the office every day. Or rather, a reason who waited for me there.

She and I had a routine. We stayed back late—sometimes until 9, sometimes 11. Last Friday, it stretched until 3 AM. Nobody cared much; the company never imposed restrictions on late hours. Most people had their work-life balance figured out and wouldn’t trade their weekends for overtime. But me? My personal life had already dissolved into these walls.

It wasn’t like we couldn’t meet outside, but she lived with her parents, and I… I was fresh out of heartbreak. My cabin became our refuge, a place where the office ended but we didn’t. For six months, this is where we lived our secret hours—long after the others left, when the corridors grew quiet, and only the hum of servers kept us company.

Our organization operates across the globe. Business Analysts and Customer Success Executives fly out constantly, gathering client requirements and delivering solutions through our platform. It’s a vision I’ve always been proud of. I serve as the Director of Sales, and for me, travel has been a constant.

Usually, it was a balancing act between my schedule and my only team member’s. When I couldn’t make it, he stepped in. Lately, though, things shifted. For the past few months, he’s been the one traveling more often than I have. He didn’t mind—in fact, he welcomed it, calling it experience that would accelerate his career. I was glad for him too.

He was twelve years younger than me, but just as courageous, just as capable. I never saw him as competition—instead, I thought of him as my successor. He had joined only a few months ago, replacing the person who held the role before him. From the start, he carried himself with a kind of quiet confidence, the sort that made me believe he’d go far.

Now, he’s dead. His body lies beneath the carpet, directly under the spot where I place my shoes every morning. The worst part? He was killed right in front of me—while I was staring straight into his eyes. And the one who killed him wasn’t a stranger. It was his wife. The same woman I’d been secretly dating for the past six months.

I know what you’re thinking—the first question that comes to mind is why I was with a married woman. The truth is, I had no idea she was married. If anything, I assumed she was like me—someone who had walked out of a toxic marriage and was still learning how to breathe again.

I never pressed her for details about her personal life. It had only been six months—hardly enough time to know every corner of each other’s pasts. I told her mine, but I didn’t expect the same in return. That was my mistake.

What I got from her was warmth—something I hadn’t felt in years. My ex never gave me that, not in the last five years of our eight-year marriage. We had no children. She didn’t want any. Ours was an arrangement, practical more than emotional. Our families convinced us to fall in love, but we never did. After years of cold, half-dead conversations, the marriage finally ended in divorce. I paid what I had to—alimony that cut deep—but I didn’t hesitate. Peace was worth any price.

They had kept their marriage private. She had joined the company a year and a half ago; he joined later, only eight months back. In the office, they never exchanged a word. To everyone else, they were strangers. But something shifted. He wanted the best for his family, while she wanted the best for herself.

When he realized what was happening between us, when he saw the truth for himself, he confronted her. And I—I stood there, still trying to understand why she was even with me if she was already married. That’s when it happened.

**It was last Friday**. We had stayed late in the office, as we always did. He had been abroad on a project—his trip supposed to last a month. But this time, he cut it short. He wanted to surprise her for their anniversary. I was the one who had approved his early return.

When he reached her parents’ house, they told him she was still at the office, working late. She had told them that herself. So he came looking. By the time he reached the building, the office was almost deserted. The hallways were dark, the lights switched off. He thought she had already left. But then he saw a glow from my cabin. Curious, maybe just wanting to say hello, he walked in.

And that’s when he saw us.

He stood at the doorway, half his body still in the shadows of the hall, the other half washed in the faint white glow of my cabin light. I remember how quiet it was—the kind of silence you only notice when you realize you’re being watched.

He didn’t say a word at first. His eyes moved between me and her, and in that single glance, I knew he understood everything. The truth was laid bare, no explanations needed.

I froze. My hands were still on the desk. She straightened her posture as if nothing was wrong, but her breathing gave her away—quick, shallow, almost trembling. He stepped further inside, each footstep dragging on the carpet. The distance between us collapsed, and still, none of us spoke.

When he finally did, his voice was quiet, almost too calm. “So this is where you spend your late nights.”

Those words didn’t sound like anger. They sounded like the end of something—final, resigned. And in that moment, I had no idea what was going on.

She broke the silence before I could. Her voice was too casual, too rehearsed, as if she’d been waiting for this moment.

“You came back early,” she said, with a small smile that didn’t touch her eyes.

He didn’t smile back. He didn’t even blink. He looked at her the way a man looks at a stranger—someone he thought he knew but no longer recognized.

“I wanted to surprise you,” he said softly. Then his eyes slid to me, locking on. “And I see I wasn’t the only one with surprises.”

I realized something.

My throat went dry. I wanted to speak, to explain, to say anything that could dilute the weight of the moment—but the words never came. He didn’t give me the chance.

“How long?” he asked her, his voice stripped bare of all warmth.

She didn’t answer right away. Instead, she tilted her head, studying him like he was an inconvenient problem rather than her husband. I saw something flicker in her eyes then—a calculation, cold and dangerous.

“It doesn’t matter,” she finally said. “Not anymore.”

The air thickened. I remember my pulse hammering in my ears, the claustrophobic awareness that something irreversible was about to happen. He took a step closer, fists clenched at his sides, but his voice remained controlled.

“You could have told me,” he said. “After everything… you could have just told me.”

Her reply came sharper this time, almost biting. “And what would you have done? Loved me harder? Changed overnight? You never saw me for who I was. He did.”

That was the first time I felt the full weight of being in the room—no longer an accomplice, not yet a victim, but undeniably part of a storm that couldn’t be stopped.

And I swear, in the seconds that followed, I could feel the office itself holding its breath with us.

He didn’t move. He just stood there, shoulders squared, eyes darting between us as though memorizing every detail—the way she sat back so calmly, the way I sat frozen like a schoolboy caught in some shameful act.

Then his gaze locked on her again. His voice cracked just slightly when he spoke:

“Sixteen years… I built everything for us. The house, the job, the savings. And you throw it all away for—” his eyes cut into me—“him?”

I wanted to speak, to defend myself, to tell him it wasn’t what he thought… but it was exactly what he thought. And he knew it. My mouth stayed shut.

She leaned forward on the desk, her tone suddenly gentle, almost maternal, like she was soothing a child. “You built everything for *you*, not for us. You wanted a wife who stood still while you chased your career. You wanted me as furniture, not a partner.”

Her words landed like stones. I could see them hit him—his jaw tightened, his shoulders stiffened. But he didn’t erupt. He didn’t scream. He just exhaled, long and slow, and for a second I thought maybe the worst was passing.

But then he whispered: “I should have known. All those late nights, all those excuses. I thought you were working hard for us. Turns out you were just—” He didn’t finish the sentence. His voice collapsed under the weight of it.

The silence after was unbearable. My cabin suddenly felt smaller than a coffin. I wanted to get up, to walk out, to give them space to fight it out without me in the room. But my legs wouldn’t move.

That’s when she shifted. Not in anger—no, in something colder. Her tone was measured, deliberate, like she had already rehearsed every word.

“Stop pretending you didn’t see this coming,” she said. “You knew I was unhappy. You knew I wanted more. But you thought if you kept me caged long enough, I’d forget. You were wrong. I chose him because he gave me what you never did. Freedom.”

Her words echoed in the office, bouncing off the glass walls. His fists trembled, but he still didn’t lash out. He just stared at her with a look I can’t erase from my mind—devastated, betrayed, yet still loving her in spite of it all.

And in that twisted triangle of silence, I realized something terrifying: one of us was not walking out of that office the same.

His voice broke the silence again, but this time it wasn’t anger—it was pleading.

“Don’t do this… not like this. If you wanted to leave me, you could have. You didn’t have to—” His throat caught, his lips trembling as if the words themselves were too heavy. “We could have ended it clean. You didn’t have to humiliate me.”

He wasn’t looking at me anymore. I didn’t exist to him. His eyes stayed fixed on her, searching for a crack in her armor, for any sign of the woman he thought he knew.

For a fleeting second, I almost pitied him. I’d seen men angry before, vengeful, violent. But this? This was worse. This was a man begging for scraps of dignity from someone who had already stripped it away.

She didn’t flinch. Didn’t blink. Her lips curled into something that wasn’t quite a smile. “You think this is about humiliation? About *you*?” she asked, her voice flat, emotionless. “No. This is about me. For once in my life, it’s about me.”

I swear, the air in that room thickened. I couldn’t breathe. My palms were slick with sweat, my heart pounding so hard I thought he could hear it. I should have said something, should have stood up, but I was paralyzed—watching two lives collide in a space that suddenly felt more like a trap than an office.

He stepped closer to her, slowly, cautiously, as if approaching a wild animal. His hands were half-raised, not in threat but in surrender. “Please,” he whispered. “Just tell me it’s not real. Tell me this was a mistake, and I’ll walk away. I’ll disappear. Just… don’t throw everything away like this.”

And then came her reply—soft, deliberate, deadly final.

“It was never a mistake.”

That was the moment the ground shifted. Not physically, but inside the room. Something broke. I felt it before I saw it.

And I knew—whatever happened next, there was no going back.

The room fell silent again, but it wasn’t the silence of hesitation anymore. It was heavier—like the pause before a storm breaks. I could feel it pressing down on me, in my chest, in the air itself.

He stood there, shaking, still begging with his eyes even as the words had run out. She leaned back slightly, her gaze locked on him with the kind of calm that frightened me more than his trembling rage.

I wanted to scream at both of them, to break the spell, to say *enough*. But I couldn’t. My tongue felt nailed to the roof of my mouth. All I could do was watch, knowing exactly what was about to happen, and powerless to stop it.

Her hand moved first. Not fast, not sudden—just deliberate, reaching toward the edge of the desk. He didn’t notice. His eyes were wet now, pleading, still searching for the woman he thought he’d loved.

And in that instant, I knew—he wasn’t going to find her. Not ever again.

What happened next… I can’t even describe it cleanly. Maybe I don’t want to. All I know is that one moment he was standing, and the next he was collapsing, his eyes still locked on hers, like he couldn’t believe what she’d done.

And I, sitting frozen just a few feet away, was the only witness.

Her hand slipped beneath the desk and came back up clutching the sharp letter opener we’d used a hundred times to slice envelopes. Only this time, her grip was different—tight, knuckles white, wrist locked like she’d already made peace with what she was about to do.

He didn’t even notice. He was still leaning forward, whispering her name like it could save him. “Please, just talk to me—”

The sound it made when she drove it into his chest was nothing like in the movies. There was no neat stab, no clean strike. It was a sickening *thud* of metal meeting flesh, followed by the wet, desperate gasp that tore out of his lungs. His body jerked violently, and his eyes shot wide open, staring at her in disbelief.

She didn’t stop. She yanked it out and plunged it again—lower this time, into his stomach. The air filled with the ragged sounds of his breathing, gurgled and broken, as blood began to pour down his shirt and spatter across the carpet. I remember the smell hitting me before the sight—the iron tang of it coating the back of my throat.

He tried to fight back, tried to push her away, but she straddled him, forcing the blade down again and again. Each strike was frantic, almost animal, until his resistance slowed, then faltered, then ended altogether.

I sat there, paralyzed, watching as the man who had trusted me with his travel schedule, the man I’d once thought of as my successor, twitched his last on the office floor. His blood spread quickly, soaking into the fibers beneath us, seeping into the very place where my shoes now rest each morning.

When it was over, she dropped the letter opener with a hollow clatter. Her face was calm. Too calm. She looked at me—not for comfort, not for guilt, but with a terrifying certainty.

“He was in the way,” she said.

And just like that, the room went quiet again. Except this time, the silence wasn’t heavy. It was absolute.

For a long time, I didn’t move. I just sat there, staring at the pool of blood spreading like an oil spill across my carpet. His body twitched once, then went still. The office—once our safe little hideaway—was suddenly a crime scene.

She stood over him, chest heaving but eyes calm, detached. Then she crouched down, tugged the blade out one last time, and wiped it on his shirt as if it were nothing more than spilled ink.

“We need to clean this,” she said. Her voice was steady, almost mechanical.

My brain screamed *no*. Call someone. Call the police. Call anyone. But my mouth betrayed me. I nodded.

We moved like sleepwalkers. She directed, I obeyed. We dragged his body—heavy, limp, leaving a dark smear across the carpet—and rolled it beneath the large rug in my cabin. His blood soaked through almost instantly, but the bulk of him disappeared. Out of sight. Hidden.

I could still feel the warmth of him on my hands. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the moment his own wife pinned him down, saw the shock in his eyes as the blade found his chest.

We scrubbed until our knuckles bled. The metallic stink of blood clung to everything—our clothes, our skin, the air itself. I remember glancing at the clock: 4:12 a.m. By the time we finished, the cleaning staff would arrive in less than two hours. And still, his body was right there, underfoot, like a grotesque secret sealed beneath the rug.

Before leaving, she looked at me and whispered, “No one will ever know. Do you understand?”

I nodded again, though I wasn’t sure if it was agreement or surrender.

But as I locked the cabin door behind us, one thought crawled into my head and hasn’t left since:

No matter how deep you bury someone, they don’t stay hidden forever.

We cleaned everything that night—scrubbed the carpet, wiped the desk, even washed our hands raw. Then we left, each of us carrying the stench of blood that no amount of soap could erase. By morning, the office looked normal again. Too normal.

I pulled strings, used my contacts, and made sure every trace of the mess was erased. Cameras, logs, schedules—all reset to the way they were. It was like nothing had ever happened.

Days passed. I forced myself to keep moving as if life were normal. The following Monday, I showed up at the office, acted sick, and applied for leave. From then on, I worked from home. Safer that way. Cleaner. I even covered his absence by updating HR and management—said he was still abroad at the client site. Nobody questioned it. After all, I was the one who had approved his early return. No one else knew.

Weeks blurred into a month. I almost convinced myself it was over. But then the board meeting forced me back.

The moment I stepped into my cabin, something shifted. The air was different—stale, suffocating, as if the walls remembered what I had done. The carpet beneath my feet seemed heavier, like it was pulling me down. Horror gripped me so suddenly that I asked for my workplace to be changed

I couldn’t sit in that room another second.

I opened my laptop, there was an email waiting for me. Sent to my official address. No sender, no subject line. Just a blank message, except for one line:

**“I know what you did.”**
