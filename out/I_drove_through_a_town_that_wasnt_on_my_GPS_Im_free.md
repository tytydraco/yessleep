———

I don’t know how long I’ve been here. Days blur together like water running over glass. The clocks all say different things, and no matter how long I stay awake, the sun never sets the same way twice. 

Sometimes it fades, sometimes it stalls, sometimes it just blinks out like someone threw a switch. But I’ve stopped caring what time it is. The only thing that matters now is getting out.

The first thing I tried was walking. I filled a backpack with water, food, a flashlight, and left the car parked in front of the motel. I followed the main road out of town until the pavement gave way to gravel, then to dirt, then to nothing but pine needles. The air grew thicker the farther I went, like I was wading through it instead of breathing it. 

After a few miles, I stopped seeing the treeline altogether—just more road stretching ahead, perfectly straight. When I turned around, the town was already back in sight, the church steeple poking above the trees like it had never left.

The second day, I tried driving at night. I thought maybe whatever was happening only worked while the sun was up. I drove until the gas gauge hit empty, headlights cutting through the fog, but when the car sputtered out, I was parked in front of the diner again. 

The lights were off, but Edna was still inside, standing by the window with that same polite smile. She didn’t move when I honked. Didn’t blink. Just watched as I sat there, trying not to scream.

The third day, I started leaving marks—spray paint arrows on the asphalt, branches snapped in half, rocks stacked into crude little towers. Every time I circled back, they were gone. The town had smoothed itself over, neat and pristine again. Even the mud on my shoes would vanish if I looked away too long.

That was the first time I noticed something else: people calling me by name. The motel clerk said, “Morning, Jessie,” like it was the most natural thing in the world. I hadn’t told him my name.

When I went to the diner for coffee, Edna asked if I’d slept better last night. I told her I didn’t think I’d mentioned that I wasn’t sleeping. She smiled. “Oh, you must’ve. You always tell me everything, sugar.”

The way she said “always” made my skin crawl.

I left half the coffee sitting there and went to the gas station to ask Hank if there was another route—maybe a back road, maybe a dirt path out through the woods. He pointed at a wall map I could’ve sworn wasn’t there before.

A red line cut straight through town and looped around like a noose. At the bottom, scrawled in pencil, was a name I didn’t recognize. But Hank tapped it like it meant something to me.

“Your granddad helped build this road, didn’t he?”

I stared at him. “What?”

“Sure did,” he said cheerfully. “Helped lay the first gravel himself. You come from good stock, Jessie.”

I backed out without another word. When I turned around, the map was gone.

That night, I drove again. The sky was black this time, not the pale gray it usually was, and the stars looked wrong—too close, too many. I kept my eyes on the road until I saw the WELCOME HOME sign, its wood clean again, paint shining fresh under the headlights. For a second, I thought I saw movement behind it—a silhouette, human-shaped but not human still. When I blinked, it was gone.

I got out of the car and tried to tear the sign down. The wood felt soft and wet, like it had just been painted. When I pulled my hands away, the paint clung to my skin, red instead of white. I ran back to the car, drove until I couldn’t keep my eyes open, and ended up parked at the motel again. The clerk waved from the window when I stumbled inside.

“Rough night?” he asked. “You always did push yourself too hard.”

He said it like we were old friends.

I didn’t answer him. I went straight to my room, locked the door, and sat on the edge of the bed until the light started leaking through the curtains again. My hands still looked stained, the red gone darker overnight, like it had sunk under the skin. 

The mirror above the sink showed a man who hadn’t slept in weeks—eyes hollow, face drawn, jaw tight enough to ache. For a second, I thought the reflection was breathing slower than I was.

In a moment of weakness, frustration, and anger I reared my arm back and smashed the mirror with my bare fist. The sound barely echoed. 

For a second, I just stared at what I’d done. The glass had splintered in a spiderweb of cracks, thin lines radiating out from the point of impact where my knuckles had gone through. Blood slid down the glass in narrow threads, catching the weak yellow light like it was rust instead of red. 

My hand throbbed, pieces of silvered glass still stuck in the skin. I tried to wash it off, but the water from the tap ran cloudy, smelling faintly of metal. When I looked up again, the cracks in the mirror seemed to shift—like they were trying to pull together, to mend themselves around the reflection of my hand.

By the next morning, it was whole again.

That’s when I started testing everything. I left the motel with my phone recording video, drove out of town, turned the car around, and played it back. The footage showed the road leading out just fine—until it reached the woods. Then the screen flickered, the camera refocused, and suddenly I was driving past the diner again. I replayed it three times. The same thing happened each time, like a film reel stitched in a loop.

Later that afternoon, I parked in front of the church. The bell was silent, but I could feel the air vibrating around it, like the sound was waiting to happen. I went inside and looked at the painting again. The figure’s face was blank now—no eyes, no mouth, just smooth, unfinished skin. I took one of the candles from the altar and pressed it against the frame. Wax dripped across the image, thick and slow.

The next morning, the painting was perfect again.

Edna waved when I passed the diner. “How’s your mama doing, Jessie? You said she wasn’t feeling too good last week.”

I froze. I hadn’t spoken about my mom since I left home.

“I didn’t—” I started, but she just smiled that same gentle smile, tilting her head. “Sure you did, sugar. You must’ve forgot.”

I left without answering. I could feel her eyes on me all the way back to the car.

By the end of that day, I’d tried breaking every window on Main Street. Each one shattered under the tire iron, sharp cracks echoing down the block. I thought maybe if I wrecked enough of it, something would have to change. But the next morning, every pane was whole again. My arms were sore, my hands blistered, and the town looked untouched.

That was the first time I heard laughter. Not loud—just soft, somewhere in the air around me. Like a child’s giggle carried on the wind. It followed me down the street, through the gas station, all the way to the car. When I turned the ignition, it stopped.

On the fifth morning—if it was morning—I found mail in the motel’s drop box. A plain white envelope with no stamp. My name written neatly across the front. Inside was a photograph.

Me, standing beside Edna in front of the diner. The same pose, same angle as the one I’d seen on my phone’s background the first day. Only now, Hank and the sheriff stood in the background, smiling like a family portrait.

People greeted me differently after that. The man sweeping his porch called me neighbor. The kids on the bikes yelled my name before riding off. Even the sheriff tipped his hat and said, “Good to see you out and about again.”

Again.

I didn’t stop driving after that. I went through the woods, across fields, through backyards. The roads didn’t matter anymore; the town rearranged itself no matter which way I turned. Once, I crashed through a fence and ended up in someone’s garden, but when I looked up, the diner was across the street. The smell of frying oil filled the air, and Edna stood in the doorway, wiping her hands on that same rag.

“You’ll hurt yourself, sugar,” she said. “No need for all that fuss. You’re home.”

That word again. Home.

The car would be parked somewhere new—the gas station, the church, sometimes in front of the motel again. Each time, the fuel gauge reset to half a tank, no matter how far I’d driven. My hand had started to heal wrong, the skin along my knuckles tightening into pale scars that almost looked like lines of writing. When I stretched my fingers, it stung, but the pain was grounding. It reminded me I was still real, at least for now.

Sometime after what I think was the eighth day, I saw something different. The town square—if you could call it that—was crowded. People stood talking in pairs, kids played tag near the church steps. The air smelled faintly of cut grass and something sweet, almost like apples left too long in the sun. 

For a heartbeat, it looked normal. Then I realized every face was turned toward me. Not directly, not in unison—but each one found me eventually. Eyes following me as I crossed the street. Smiles widening. Nods exchanged like I’d just come home from work.

Edna waved from the diner window. Hank lifted his coffee in greeting. Even the sheriff was there, leaning against his car.

“Morning, Jessie,” he called. “Good to see you out early.”

I didn’t respond. I just kept walking, pretending not to notice that some of them were whispering my name, their lips moving in unison as they spoke.

By that afternoon, I found a new photo waiting under my windshield wiper. This one showed me standing in front of the church, wearing the sheriff’s badge on my chest. The ink was still wet when I picked it up.

That night, the bell rang again. Three times. I counted. The sound was deeper now, like it came from under the ground instead of above it. I looked out from the motel window and saw shadows gathering at the base of the steeple. Dozens of them, still as statues. When the last toll faded, they all turned toward me at once.

I drove. Didn’t even grab my bag this time. The headlights flickered as I tore down the road, past the diner, past the sign. The trees blurred together until they looked like a single dark wall. The air buzzed in my ears, thick with static. I thought I was making progress—I felt it. The odometer was ticking up, the temperature dropping, the fog thinning.

Then I saw someone standing in the middle of the road ahead.

For a second, I thought it was the sheriff again. But when the beams caught him, I saw my own face looking back.

He was dressed like me, same jacket, same bloodstained hand. He smiled faintly, raised a hand in greeting, and walked toward the diner on the right side of the road. I saw Edna open the door for him.

I don’t remember deciding to move. I just slammed the gas pedal. The car roared forward, trees whipping by, the engine screaming as I tore past the sign. The world seemed to twist for a moment—everything bending inward, folding itself around the sound of the tires on asphalt.

Then it was gone.

The trees opened into a wide expanse of gray sky, and ahead of me was a familiar stretch of highway. My phone buzzed in the passenger seat, the first service I’d seen in days. A green exit sign flashed by. I slowed down, shaking so hard my hands slipped on the wheel.

For a long time, I just drove without thinking—past billboards, past rest stops, until I saw another car again. A minivan with a family inside. The sight made my throat tighten.

When I finally pulled into a gas station, the world looked normal again. Real sunlight, real sound, the smell of fuel and hot pavement. I sat there until I could breathe without trembling. Then I glanced at my phone.

My lock screen had changed. It was a photo of me, standing in front of the diner. Only this time, I wasn’t smiling.

Behind me, through the window, I could see the other version of myself sitting at the counter, waving.

I kept thinking about him—the other me. The one who walked down the street like he’d been born there. He moved with this calm, unhurried ease, smiling when people called his name, laughing at things I couldn’t hear. The way Edna leaned toward him at the diner window, the way Hank clapped him on the shoulder—it was all so natural, like it had always been that way. I realized then that the town hadn’t been trying to keep me there. It had been trying to make me there. Each loop, each morning, every detail it learned about me was just another stitch, sewing me into its memory until I belonged. And now that it had what it wanted, I can’t stop thinking about why.
