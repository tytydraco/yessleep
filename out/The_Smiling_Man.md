The first time Richard saw him, it was nothing more than a passing unease—a figure standing at the end of his street, shoulders hunched, barely more than a shape in the shadows beneath the streetlamp. The man was facing his house, grinning. Richard brushed it off as a late-night jogger or some night owl who had lost his way. After all, the figure was a hundred yards away, just a silhouette in the fog-thickened night. 



But the next night, the man was back. 



Richard’s skin crawled as he glanced out the front window. The figure was a little closer now, not far from his neighbor’s mailbox. The pale streetlight illuminated more details than he cared to see—gaunt cheeks that sank against his skull, dark hollows where his eyes should have been, and that wide, unsettling smile stretched too far across his face. 



Richard quickly shut the curtains, willing himself to forget, to sleep. 



Yet every night, the man returned, standing closer, lingering longer.



By the fifth night, Richard noticed a new smell—something cloying, metallic, like rusted pennies soaked in vinegar. The scent slithered into his home, lingering on his clothes, sticking to his hair, tainting his dreams. And the figure had come closer still, no longer near his neighbors but standing halfway up the street, close enough that Richard could see thin strands of dark hair plastered against a sunken scalp.



The smile stretched wider.



On the seventh night, Richard dared not look at the window. He told himself his mind was playing tricks on him, but sleep refused him. The scent—the rotting, sour reek—was thicker now. His throat tightened as he lay frozen in bed, listening to the night. Every creak of the house felt like a footfall, every shadow along the wall threatened to form the thin, hollow figure that waited outside.



At some hazy hour before dawn, he lost consciousness, slipping into fitful, dark dreams of decayed teeth and eyeless faces.



When he woke, his curtains were wide open.



Shaking, he stumbled to the window, dragging the heavy drapes shut, and caught the briefest flash of the figure, now standing in the grass at the edge of his yard. The man’s grin had grown monstrous, a cavernous slash cutting across his face. His eyes stared up at Richard's window, unblinking, hungrily.



Richard bolted the front door that night. He locked the windows, turned on every light in the house, and stayed up, trembling, as he waited for the night to pass. Yet some morbid curiosity held him, and every few hours, he would glance out between the drapes, hoping the figure would be gone. But there he stood, closer than ever, standing at the foot of the driveway.



The next night, Richard locked everything again. He tried to leave the lights on, but they flickered out, one by one. He crept up the stairs, hands shaking, eyes watering as he struggled to breathe, forcing himself to look out the window.



The man was gone.



Relief and terror mingled as Richard backed away from the window, hand covering his mouth. But the moment he turned, he froze, every muscle going rigid. 



There, behind him, pressed against the glass, was the smiling man, his face up close, skin pressed so tightly to the window that it seemed thin enough to tear, stretched over the dark hollows of his eyes, revealing more bone than flesh.



His breath fogged the glass as he tilted his head, pressing closer, lips splitting, leaking thin, dark trickles as he mouthed something soundlessly.



The moment Richard saw the man in the window, he stumbled back, heart hammering in his chest. He slipped on the rug, crashing to the floor. For a brief, frantic second, his eyes darted behind him, checking the shadows, the corners—anything to reassure himself he was alone.



He caught his breath, steadied himself, and looked back toward the window.



But the figure was gone.



Relief flooded him, followed quickly by embarrassment. He pressed a hand to his chest, swallowing down the dread that had seized him. It was over. It had to be over. He closed his eyes, exhaling slowly, trying to steady his nerves.



Suddenly, a hand, ice-cold and damp, pressed down on his shoulder. The grip tightened, painfully hard, forcing the breath from his lungs.



And then he heard the voice.



Low, rasping, warm breath against his ear as it whispered.



“Let me in.”
