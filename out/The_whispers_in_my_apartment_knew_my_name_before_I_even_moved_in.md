I never thought I’d be writing this, but here I am desperate to share what happened to me last week.

So many people think horror is about monsters or bloodshed, but what I experienced felt like the slow unraveling of reality itself.

It started one ordinary afternoon. I had just moved into a new apartment in a quaint old building, excited to finally settle in on my own. The peeling wallpaper and creaky floors gave it a certain charm or so I thought. As I set up my plants by the window and unrolled my yoga mat in the living room, I felt this strange flicker of déjà vu, like I had lived there before. I brushed it off first day nerves, I figured.

The first few days were fine. Peaceful, even. I took evening walks, watched the sunset over the hills, and felt good. But then, small things began to chip away at that peace.

The lights would flicker. Not enough to scare me just enough to notice. Then I began waking up with the eerie sense of being watched. Again, I dismissed it. Living alone for the first time can play tricks on your mind.

Everything shifted one night while I was cooking dinner. A sharp, chemical scent filled the air burnt metal with a strange sweetness underneath. I checked the stove, the garbage, even the pipes. Nothing explained it. I opened the window to clear the smell, and that’s when I saw her.

An old woman, wrapped in layers of tattered clothing, standing across the street. Staring directly at me.

Our eyes locked for maybe three seconds but it felt like minutes. Something in my stomach turned cold. I pulled the curtains shut. Just a random stranger. Harmless, right?

But I couldn’t shake her from my mind.

That night, I heard whispers. Soft. Just barely audible. My name spoken like a secret. “Marissa…” I sat up, heart pounding, ears straining. Nothing. Silence. I blamed it on dreams. Sleep paralysis. Maybe I was overtired.

But every night, the whispers returned. I’d wake up, drenched in sweat, and feel something in the corners of the room… watching.

Things got worse when I found the journal.

I was unpacking a box of books and discovered it tucked between two novels I didn’t remember owning. Leather bound. Old. Its pages yellowed and full of handwritten entries in neat cursive. The early pages were normal  errands, recipes, random thoughts.

But then the tone shifted. The writer described shadows that moved where shadows shouldn’t. Whispers in the dark. A woman watching from the street. The last entry said  “She’s watching. She’s waiting.”

That night, the voice returned louder. Clearer. “Marissa…”

I couldn’t ignore it anymore.

I crept to the living room, peeled back the curtain. Nothing. Just the street and a flickering streetlight.

But when I turned, I saw them.

Figures tall, thin, stretching along the far wall like shadows painted with a trembling hand. I blinked, thinking I imagined it, but they moved. Twisting. Unfolding. Reaching.

I ran back to my bedroom and didn’t sleep at all.

The next day, I crossed the street. I had to talk to her the old woman. She sat on a bench, her head lowered. As I approached, she looked up, and her eyes… weren’t right. Deep black voids where irises should’ve been. Empty. Cold.

“Can I help you?” I asked, voice shaky.

She didn’t answer for a long moment, then finally rasped, “You shouldn’t be there.”

“What do you mean?”

She leaned closer. Her breath smelled like rust and mildew. “It’s her place now.”

“Whose?”

“The one who whispers. If you listen too long… she’ll take you.”

Then she stood and walked away.

That night, I didn’t just hear the whispers I heard something beneath them. Clicking. Hissing. Like insects crawling behind the walls. I blasted music to drown it out, but the voices cut through everything.

At some point I don’t remember when I saw her. A shadow with flowing dark hair, pale face stretched too thin, eyes hollow. She didn’t walk. She drifted, just beyond the edge of where the light reached.

She said my name again. “Marissa…”

I tried to leave. I grabbed my keys. But the door wouldn’t open. I threw myself against it, screamed, cried but behind me, laughter echoed. High pitched. Wrong. Childlike, but cruel.

In the chaos, her words came back to me: “She sees you…”

I don’t know how I made it out.

I’m writing this now in my car, parked far from that building. I haven’t gone back. I won’t.

But the whispers? They’ve started again soft, on the edge of hearing.

If you ever hear your name whispered in the dark… don’t turn around.
Just run.
