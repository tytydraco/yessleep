It is important to preface that I once had a friend Michael that went missing, and despite me having a clearer picture than the police or anyone like that, I still don't know for sure what happened. You see, a week or so before Michael's disappearance, he sent me some very odd messages. It started simple, with him sending me a picture of himself in a brand new suit he bought and saying "Doesn't this suit make my eyes look good?". You'd think nothing of that, right? Well, it got worse. Eventually, all he'd talk about to me is him staring into the mirror, specifically at his eyes and how good they looked in that god damn suit. I only came over once before he disappeared, and it was nearly impossible to hold a conversation with him because he was staring into the mirror constantly and barely paying attention to what I was even saying. He sent me one message before he went missing, and it still haunts me. "They're coming for me, they know how good I look now, too. They want to steal my eyes." is exactly what he said to me. Now, I attempted to brush this off as a joke, but I knew deep down that he was being deadly serious, and either he had gone completely insane or was in an immense amount of danger. Despite this knowledge, nobody ever found him, and he's been missing for 6 years.  
Anyways, onto how this affects me. It all happened a few nights ago, I was walking down Oak Lane at approximately 4PM, and I saw a man standing in the alleyway by the tattoo shop. He was well-dressed, in a nice suit and hat, and was standing in a way that was equal parts accomplished and professional. I ignored him and moved on, but when I got home to my apartment, I saw him standing in the parking lot, standing in the exact same way. At this point, I felt compelled to take a closer look at him to assess what the chances of him stalking and killing me were, and I noticed one horrifying detail, something that had been pushed to the very deepest recesses of my mind, his eyes... they were just like Michael's.  A soft, pale blue that faded into a strange gray toward the edges. They were such ordinary eyes, something you'd never take any notice of under normal circumstances, but they were his. Understandably, I freaked out and ran into my bedroom, where I started hyperventilating and eventually calmed myself down, the man left about 5 minutes afterwards and nothing remarkable happened for the rest of the night.  


The next night however is a different story, I woke up having nearly forgotten what had transpired the night before, but I am very quickly reminded when I check my phone and see a notification from Michael. "Impossible, this has to be some sort of bug!" I said to myself, but I knew it couldn't be. Checking the message was either the best or worst thing I decided to do, it may have informed me of what exactly was happening, or sealed my fate. The message read "Your eyes looked amazing in that outfit.". I started absolutely flipping out at this point, trying to convince myself I must be hallucinating while running to the bathroom in order to splash some cold water on my face in some feeble attempt to wake up. However, while doing this I yet again notice something. He was in the reflection of my eyes, that god damn man, the one who must have taken Michael from us all, he was just stood there. I kept staring for a few minutes trying to find some sort of meaning in it, but to no avail. I quickly went to sleep, dreading waking up the next morning.  


Cut to today, and it's getting far worse. I go to brush my teeth and notice the man is still a reflection in my eyes, "You've gotta be kidding me, I'm gonna end up kidnapped by some fucking ghost guy just like Michael!", I screamed aloud, in a mix of rage and fear. I quickly take a picture to Jessica, a friend of mine who was also around the time of Michael's disappearance, but refused to believe anything I told her. I sent her a picture of my eyes saying "I'm gonna end up like Michael, please for the love of fucking god get someone to help me now. They think my eyes are worth it just like his were, they're gonna steal my eyes, Jess.". Now, if there was anybody on this earth that would deny my insane mental breakdown at this point, it would be Jess. But unfortunately, the reply I receive is "Who the fuck is that reflecting in your eye? Aren't you looking at your bathroom mirror?". I can only muster up the motivation to reply with "Yes, yes I was.", and even that was a challenge.  


Once again, we move to 4PM, the time where I first saw him. I hear a knocking at my door, I already know what's happening. I look through the peephole and sure enough, it's him. My hand instinctively goes to open the door, but I can't stop myself. Everything afterwards went completely black, but when I woke up... I was outside Jessica's house, and I was about to send her a message which read "I really like how your eyes looked in your favorite outfit all those years back.". Her eyes were always just so damn pretty, I never really noticed it before... but yeah, they were always gorgeous. I plan to buy a great suit to go and say hi to her in person for the first time in ages, do you guys have any recommendations?
