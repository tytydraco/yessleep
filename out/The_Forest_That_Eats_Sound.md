They warned us: don’t enter the woods after dark. Not because of wolves. Not because of bears. They said the forest takes things.

I thought it was just a story. Something old. Something meant to scare us. But standing here now, at the edge of the trees, I know they were right.

It started small. At dark, my brother and I went trekking. Red light poured over the trees as the sun sank. Everything appeared normal at first.

Then the birds stopped. The wind stopped. Even the crunch of leaves under our boots grew faint. I noticed the silence before I understood it. It wasn’t the silence of an empty space. It pressed on us, heavy, like the air had thickened.

“Do you hear that?” my brother asked.

I started to respond, but nothing came out. I felt my throat move. I felt the vibration. But the sound was gone.

We stopped walking. We stood still, listening to the nothing. It didn’t feel like silence anymore. It felt like the forest itself was listening.

I motioned for my brother to leave. We turned back. But the silence followed us. Each step made the world feel thinner. Our footsteps vanished. My heartbeat faded. Even the sound of my breathing disappeared.

Then the trees moved.

I initially believed it to be the wind. But there was no wind. The branches didn’t sway. They twisted. They bent inward, curling like claws. The bark split open, groaning without sound. The trunks stretched taller, their shapes shifting in ways that shouldn’t be possible.

I tugged my brother’s arm. I wanted to run. He didn’t move. He was staring at the ground.

“Look,” he mouthed.

I looked down.

The dirt was moving. It rippled, slow and uneven, like water disturbed by a drop. Leaves curled in on themselves, then opened again, like they were breathing. Roots pushed up from the soil, writhing and coiling like snakes.

I grabbed my brother’s arm harder. My feet sank into the ground. The dirt felt soft now, wet and alive. It clung to my boots, pulling me down.

My brother didn’t move. He stared ahead. His body was rigid.

Then I saw it.

The trees had shifted into something else. Their branches wove together, forming shapes that looked almost human. From the bark sprang faces, hollow and distorted, their mouths gaping open in mute cries. They stared with eyes that were black abysses.

I tried to scream, but no sound came. The air felt thick in my throat, choking me.

My brother stepped forward.

“No!” I tried to yell, but the word disappeared, swallowed by the silence. I reached for him, but the roots moved faster. They wrapped around his ankles, then his legs. He didn’t struggle. He didn’t blink.

The roots pulled him down. Slowly. Inch by inch. His lips was wide as though he wanted to scream, but his face remained still.

I reached out again, but the ground grabbed at my legs. It felt alive, pulling me back. My brother sank lower, the roots twisting tighter around him.

The trees leaned closer. Their faces stretched, their hollow eyes watching me. For a moment, I felt something—heard something. A low, deep vibration inside my skull. It wasn’t a sound. It was a pressure, growing stronger, making my teeth ache.

My brother vanished into the earth.

I turned and ran.

I can't recall how I got out. The world returned when I emerged from the tree line. The wind roared in my ears. My breath sounded like thunder. My heart pounded so loud it hurt.

But I can’t go back. Not for my brother. Not for anyone.

The forest doesn’t just take sound.

It takes [everything](http://www.youtube.com/@TheUnseen2025).
