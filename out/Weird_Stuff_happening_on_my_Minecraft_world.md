So, Idk where to start. I guess I should start by saying that I play Minecraft on PS5, so I don't have access to mods. I can buy stuff from the Minecraft store, but if I wanted any mods like From The Fog or other scary mods, I would have to find stuff on the store. That being said, I decided not too long ago that since I cannot do those crazy modded YouTube videos maybe I can start making some relaxing longplay videos since I really love to build in the game. So I started making a new world, and I entered it. It was a peaceful mode world where my goals were simple. Find a variety of wood, find a nice location, then make a pretty house. Simple, right?  


Well, the weird stuff happened basically the second I spawned. I started walking around and my footsteps were delayed so it was quiet when I would walk, but it sounded like someone was always following me. However, I didn't think much of it since audio issues sometimes fix itself as I continue to play. But even when I started gathering wood and playing for a while, it never fixed, and seemed to only get worse to the point where the audio delay began to even effect my PS5 itself. I decided to just reset it by turning it off and turning the PS5 back on. When I did that, things were fine, so I started recording again and began to play again. But this time, out of the corner of my in game eyes, I began to see things. Shadows darting away as soon as I looked directly at it. I was watching some From the Fog videos so I assumed that maybe I was just getting jumpy and continued playing. But as I began reaching my first hour, I started seeing it more and more. It was tall and black, like an enderman, but they shouldn't spawn in my world while in peaceful mode, right? I tried to ignore it and even avoid it, I just wanted to play, but it kept on watching me, and it was really starting to creep me out.  


Finally, I mustered the courage, and the next time I saw it I ran after it. I wanted to see what would happen, and maybe see if maybe, someone joined my game and I just didn't know since I turned off chat notifications. I followed it to a cave, where it stopped and turned to me. I typed in chat, asking who they were and to politely ask them to leave. But there was no reply. It looked like an enderman with no eyes, but it moved my head when I moved, so I assume it could see me.   


I was getting weirded out, and a bit frustrated, I wanted to continue streaming my longplay so I decided to hit it. It's mouth opened like an agreed enderman, but the noise was different than an agreed enderman. The noise it made was like a ear piercing screech, like a banshee and my screen suddenly started contorting with colors and the noise got louder and louder. My PS5 began to start getting louder, and I was afraid it was going to overheat so I unplugged it and everything finally went dark.  


I plugged it in again and turned it back on, the same message popped up as it always does when you unplug it accidentally while it was on and it began to load and searched for any files that were corrupted during the forced shut off. And when it came back I also checked my stuff. Firstly, all the recordings I made were gone. The video files were there and they had the same record time, but whenever I clicked on them they wouldn't play, and kept the Minecraft picture on it whenever I clicked at different times. That was frustrating, as now I had no video evidence to what I witnessed, but I thought it was fine, maybe I can go back into that world and record something real quick, as now I no longer cared about playing my longplay, but getting to the bottom of whatever this was since it cause my game to act strange and my PS5 to almost explode. But I also was scared to do it because of that. BUt I needed to know.
