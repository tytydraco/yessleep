Me and my friend, Cat, have discovered this game based off of one our favorite movie series: Puppet Master. The game itself is pretty much self-explanatory. It is a asymmetrical horror game with simple aspects. Now, the game has been out for awhile now but there were some pretty hidden bugs we had encountered. After a couple updates, the game seemed to run as normal.  We found the game to have pretty much the same main online players. We made some friends and made some "enemies". It was never personal. 

We kept playing when the game sorta died. Only a couple people played it during this period. We just grinded XP or whatever we could to wait for people to join our servers. There were many strange encounters with people. This one guy named "Rat" during the upscale period had practically held the game up. He did some pretty messed up things so we ratted him out. The punchline wasn't purposeful. He was too friendly in a matter. Eventually he gave in and stopped playing. Me and Cat were practically always online so when he would create a server, we had no choice but to join him as well.

When he stopped playing we noticed a lot of his so called "friends" stopped playing too. The game suddenly had a downfall of players. We just kept doing what we usually do: farm XP or play around. This is when we noticed the game started to reveal more bugs. The bugs weren't any we have encountered with other players. It was something oddly eerie. I didn't like it at all. The game only bugged and glitched out during night hours when no one were around. Just me and Cat. It would happen all at once. One after another it would keep coming in until we would get too freaked out. We laughed it off but eventually this happened almost every day. Last night we made a server for 4 people. It was just Cat, MackGuy, CloudyVincent, and I. The doors wouldn't open properly and when hitting, no damage would be taken in. They got tired of it and left us alone. We wanted to make a recording for Youtube so we went ahead and made another server for just us. Some guy named Cristian joined but then left. It was weird in a way. I left the room for awhile to grab a glass of water and when I came back, Cat was freaked out. She told me the bot was just standing in the corner of one of the rooms. We hit him and it took no damage again. He ran off. Finally, actual players joined. I checked the leaderboard but it was bugged on Cristian's name. Odd. The bot would keep pacing back and forth, running at a strangely high speed, and no-clipping through the walls. This all was not normal.

To sum this up, the game hates when we play at a specific time now that it has little players. As corny as it sounds, it's like it's punishing us for making the game die. We thought it could be an Internet thing but it has nothing to do with the application itself. For it is just a game. Nobody's hardly online during our night hours so it should run like normal, right? It started off with disturbing bugs. It's now gotten to the point it crashes for the both of us. I've gotten too weirded out to even try to play at night anymore. It's not like I can reach out to one of the mods to help us figure it out. We'd seem crazy or most likely a troll. Maybe we can just switch games for now. Maybe the servers can't run with only 2 players. But, to counter that, it still bugs with a normal amount of players: just at night. Nobody has noticed this but us. 

This has really bothered me. It's not like it's serious or anything. Just a game being freaky. 

Whatever it is, it shouldn't be going after Cat and I. We're just normal players.
