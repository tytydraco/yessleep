There’s a thin line between being an underground rapper on the come-up and being a broke-ass loser talking shit on the internet.

Unfortunately, I’ve spent most of my career firmly in the **latter** category. Which is why, when I say that the dumbest thing I’ve ever done started with **one tweet**, I need you to understand the weight of that.

Because I should have known better.

I work at **The Rusty Key Inn,** which is a rotting corpse of a roadside motel, held together by bad decisions, nicotine stains, and the stubborn refusal of the owner, **Old Man Clyde,** to admit the place should have been condemned twenty years ago. Clyde is my boss. Kind of.

He was also a former blues musician, a cryptic old bastard, and a man who has attempted to chain-smoke and drink his way to an early death...but is somehow still kicking.

I work the night shift.

Which means I spend most of my time sitting at the front desk, drinking stale coffee, and trying to ignore the fact that this place is absolutely haunted. Oh, and writing rhymes.

Tonight was no different. Until I found the journal...

Cleaning staff hate Room 3. Not because it’s dirty—but because every time they clean it, something changes overnight.

**Furniture moved.**

**Drawers rearranged.**

**Lights turned on by themselves.**

That’s why, when a guest left a notebook behind in there, they refused to touch it. I found it sitting dead center on the nightstand, the cover open to a half-ripped page. The handwriting was erratic, scrawled like someone was in a hurry—or panicking.

**DO NOT LISTEN TO THE SIGNALS.**

**DO NOT GO TO THE BASEMENT.**

**STAY AWAY FROM THE MINES.**

I shivered. Then I turned the page.

**JANUARY 27TH**

**IT ALWAYS HAPPENS AGAIN**

My stomach dropped. Because that’s **today’s date.**

Look, I’m **NOT** the smartest guy alive. But if a guest’s creepy journal tells you not to go to the basement, what’s the first thing any normal person would do?

*Exactly.*

**Go directly to the basement.**

I shouldn’t have. The lights didn’t work right down there. Everything is too quiet.

I was about to turn back when I noticed something sitting on a shelf, half-hidden behind a stack of old linens. A dusty, taxidermy parrot, perched on a wooden stand. Its eyes were glass, its feathers moth-eaten and brittle. I don’t know why, but I reached out and touched it. The moment my fingers brushed the beak, the thing spoke.

In Clyde’s voice.

**"Ain't no second chances, kid."**

I nearly shit myself.

I spun around. Clyde wasn’t there. The parrot’s beak hadn’t moved. Did I mention the parrot had a pirate hat? It had a pirate hat. And an eye patch.

But before I could even process it—there was a click. And then—a hidden door slid open in the basement wall.

Behind it was something I was never meant to find. The room smelled like old paper and static electricity.

Inside, under a thick layer of dust and neglect, sat a fully operational pirate radio station.

**An ancient mixing board.**

**A rusted microphone.**

**A reel-to-reel tape deck—running, even though it wasn’t plugged in.**

I took a step forward. A voice came through.

My voice.

Then the recording cut off. And a new voice came through.

Not mine. Something deeper, layered in static and something almost… alive.

Then—knocking.

From inside the walls.

I ran.

**The next night,** I was at **The Howling Hound** downing beers with **Todd** and **Chris**. **Big Ray** was the owner of the bar, and he still talked like every conversation was being recorded for a pay-per-view event.

“You boys out here lookin’ like JOBBERS tonight,” Big Ray boomed, slamming down a beer in front of Elan. “You gotta walk in with **PRESENCE**. With **INTENTION**. A **LEGEND** doesn’t just **EXIST**—he makes the world **NOTICE**.”

I rubbed my temples. “Ray, I don’t know what half those words mean in this context.”

Big Ray leaned in, deadly serious. “That’s ‘cause you **AIN’T LIVIN’ ‘EM**.”

I sighed. “I don’t have time for philosophy from a guy who once claimed he ***suplexed Bigfoot*****.**”

Big Ray slammed a fist on the table. “**CLAIMED?! I DID SUPLEX BIGFOOT.**"

This was the dynamic. Always. And normally? It was fine. But tonight, I was fucking stressed.

**Chris**, our manager, was lecturing me about my life choices. **Marcus**—my hype man, **aka "Hung Tongue"**—had just gotten arrested for selling fake Rolexes to an undercover cop. **Todd (aka "Trackmaster Todd"**), our resident conspiracy theorist DJ, was encouraging my worst instincts. We call our group **THE BLIZZARD BOYS**. And now we needed money to get Marcus out of jail.

“You could always start a beef with a famous rapper,” Todd joked.

I blinked.

Marcus, who'd called from county jail on speakerphone to tell us he'd been arrested, perked up immediately.

“Wait. Hold up. That’s actually genius.”

Chris groaned.

“No. No. Absolutely fucking not.”

But I wasn’t listening. Because **I already didn’t like Warcloud.**

Warcloud is a **real** gangster.

Like, **alleged bodies, confirmed felonies, don’t-fuck-with-him gangster.** But as a rapper?

**Garbage.**

His flow is choppy, his bars are weak, and half his songs end mid-sentence like he just gave up halfway through.

And that’s exactly what I tweeted.

EZ$ @EZMoneyRapGod

**"Crazy how some of these rappers out here got bodies but not a single bar to their name."**

Marcus, still on speakerphone, yelled “DO IT” from the jail phone.

Todd whispered, **“Make it worse.”**

So I did.

EZ$ @EZMoneyRapGod

**I’m talking about you**, @RealWarcloud. **Y’all love this man but let’s be real, half his verses sound like he had a stroke mid-bar."**

Chris put his head in his hands.

“You **want** to die, don’t you?”

I sat back, satisfied.

“It’s fine. He’s not gonna see it.”

Then—the jukebox cut out.

For five full seconds, the bar was silent, except for a strange hissing static crackling through the speakers.

And then—Big Ray, without missing a beat, said: “That’s the signals.”

I opened my mouth.

I *almost* told him. Almost told him about the basement. About the journal. About **the radio station that shouldn’t exist**. But at that moment, I said nothing.

We were halfway home when the streetlights flickered.

At the edge of the parking lot, standing just outside the glow of the last street lamp, was **an ancient looking man holding a lantern**. He was still as a statue. His clothes were old, covered in dust, like he’d stepped out of another century. And the light in his lantern didn’t flicker. It just… glowed. Steady. Sickly yellow. Like it wasn’t a flame at all. My stomach dropped.

And then the stars disappeared.

The entire sky went black, like someone had thrown a switch. Todd froze beside me.

Chris whispered, “*What the fuck?”*

We all stood there, silent, not breathing. Then, just as suddenly as it happened— the streetlights buzzed back on.

The stars were back.

And **the Lantern Man?**

Gone.

Todd spoke first.

**“We’re not talking about this.”**

Chris nodded immediately. “**Agreed**.”

I exhaled. **“Yeah. Definitely.”**

We started walking again, faster this time. None of us looked back.

**THE NEXT MORNING**

I wasn’t hungover. Not exactly. But my brain felt like it had been left on a low-volume static channel all night. I barely slept. Between the tweets at Warcloud, Marcus still being in jail, and whatever the fuck happened in the basement, I had too much noise in my head. And I hadn’t even asked the worst question yet...

I wasn’t supposed to be at the Rusty Key Inn until my night shift, but Clyde had finally written out the paychecks, and if I didn’t pick mine up now, I’d probably never see it. Clyde had a habit of losing important things—like time, keys, and basic human empathy—so the safest move was to get my money before he forgot where he put it.

When I walked into the lobby, Clyde was sitting behind the desk, chain-smoking like he was trying to kill whatever part of himself was still alive.

“Morning, kid.” He took a long drag, then stubbed his cigarette out in a coffee mug that definitely didn’t contain coffee.

I hesitated. This was not the kind of guy who responded well to direct questions. But I had to ask.

“So…” I leaned against the counter. “You ever hear about a **pirate radio station** in the basement?”

Clyde blinked. “**Basement’s closed**.”

“That wasn’t my question.”

He scratched his chin. “We don’t **got** a pirate radio station.”

I crossed my arms. “Then what the fuck is **all that equipment down there**?”

He let out a long, slow breath.

“Son,” he said, “you ever been out to the woods at night?”

I frowned. “What?”

“You ever hear a sound, and you ain’t sure if it’s a bird or somethin’ else?”

I hesitated.

Clyde nodded. “That’s the thing about signals. You don’t **gotta** understand ‘em to hear ‘em.”

He stood up, tapped his half-burnt cigarette against the desk.

“**You keep your ass outta that basement.**”

Then he walked off like that was the end of the conversation.

**Marcus called 20 minutes later.** I put him on speaker.

"Bro," he said, "you gotta get me out. This is inhumane. I had to **shit in front of another man**."

Chris sighed. “Marcus. You were selling fake Rolexes to an undercover cop.”

“How was I supposed to know he was a cop?!"

"He was wearing a badge."

"A lot of people wear badges, Chris!"

Todd nodded solemnly. "That’s true. Some of them aren’t even real cops."

Chris turned to me. “So. What’s the plan? Because bail ain’t free.”

I exhaled. “I’m working on it.”

Which is when I remembered **Big Ray’s offer.**

The Howling Hound was having a little problem with some pencil-pushing city council asshole from Town Hall who was trying to **get the bar shut down**.

Ray needed someone to handle it.

Not with violence—just something petty, humiliating, and perfectly timed.

And if we pulled it off, Ray would help with Marcus’ bail.

So we started plotting...

**LATER THAT EVENING**

Around 3 AM, the old 1970s radio behind the desk crackled to life. Even though \*it wasn’t plugged in.\*

***"You’re listening to KCRP, the high-altitude heartbeat of Cripple Creek!"***

I froze.

***"Tonight’s topic? Strange happenings in our little town."***

I didn’t move.

Because I knew this wasn’t live.

This was decades old.

***"Ain’t nothin’ new, folks.*****"** The DJ chuckled. ***"You’ve seen the Lantern Man. You’ve heard the whispers. You know about the mines."***

I swallowed.

Then he said, **“January 27th.”**

I flinched.

That was today.

The static warped.

Then a new voice layered over the broadcast.

**“Elan."**

My breath hitched. The radio crackled.

**“Are you listening?"**

The lights flickered. The air felt thick, wrong, charged with static. And then the power cut out. Total darkness. For a second, I thought I saw someone standing in the reflection of the motel lobby window.

Tall. Flickering like bad reception.

Then the lights snapped back on. And the radio was off.

**THE NEXT DAY**

I barely slept. When I got to work the next evening, the housekeeping staff was uneasy. One of them—Maria, who had been working here longer than Clyde had owned the place—pulled me aside.

“Hey. That trucker that you checked into Room 6?”

I nodded. “Yeah?”

Maria hesitated.

**“Did you see him leave?”**

I frowned. “Only when he checked in...”

She nodded. “Room’s untouched. Sheets still tucked. Shower’s dry. Mint on the pillow's still there. Nothing disturbed. But the radio was on, just playing static.”

I swallowed. I had checked him in. I had taken his cash. And then? Nothing.

Maria exhaled. **“I don’t like it.”**

She walked off.

I didn’t tell her about the radio broadcast the night before. Because I didn’t know how to explain it. And even if I did? **I didn’t think I wanted to say it out loud.**



Tina is one of the Rusty Key’s most loyal customers. Not because she paid for rooms, but because she was always around, hanging out in the parking lot or bumming smokes off guests. The inn was cheap, full of weirdos, and had no cameras, which made it perfect for her, uh, lifestyle.

Tonight, she had found herself a biker. The guy looked like he had been in a bar fight sometime in the last 48 hours and probably lost.

He threw some crumpled-up bills on the counter. “Room for the night.”

Tina winked at me as they took the key.

“You need anything, I’ll be in Room 9,” she said, popping her gum. “Like hell,” the biker grumbled, already leading her toward the stairs. I sighed, grabbed the key for Room 9, and tossed it over.

“Enjoy your stay.”

It wasn’t until later that Tina came back. She barged into the lobby, her mascara smudged, looking pale as hell. I frowned. “What now?”

She jabbed a thumb toward the courtyard.

I stared at her. “Are you high?”

She rolled her eyes. “Not the point.”

The biker stumbled in behind her, looking less convinced but still unsettled.

“I saw it too, man.” He rubbed his arms. “Some dude in a trucker cap, standing in the courtyard. Just… watching.”

“Did he say anything?”

Tina shook her head.

The biker lit a cigarette with shaky hands. “I looked away for a second. When I looked back, he was gone.”

Tina folded her arms. “That was a ghost.”

“Coulda been a guest,” I said, even though I knew it wasn’t.

Tina gave me a deadpan stare. “Bro, **the dude had no face**."

I exhaled... Just another night at the Rusty Key Inn.

Once they left, I sat at the front desk, staring at the radio.

I knew I shouldn’t. I knew Clyde told me to leave it alone. But I couldn’t let it go. The signals were talking to me. And when Clyde tells you not to do something?

**That’s how you know it’s worth doing.**

I grabbed my flashlight and headed down into the basement. The air was thick, musty, like an old library and burnt wires. The stuffed parrot sat on its perch, its glass eyes staring at me. I don’t know what possessed me to do it, but I reached out and touched its beak. The thing jerked forward slightly, like something inside it clicked into place. And then, just like before—the hidden door slid open. Inside, the radio station sat untouched, like it had been waiting for me.

Dusty. Ancient.... But still running.

I took a deep breath and stepped up to the microphone.

I didn’t know why. I just did. I tapped it. “Uh. Hello?”

Silence. Then - a click.

And a new recording began to play.

**“February 2nd, 1975.”**

I frowned.

***“Weather’s been strange lately. The static’s been worse. And the mines? Well, you know what’s down there.”***

My stomach tightened. The voice wasn’t Clyde. But the background music?

**It was one of Clyde’s old blues songs**. The recording continued.

***“Some of you are already hearing the signals. Some of you have seen the Lantern Man.”***

I swallowed hard. The static warped. And then the voice changed.

Deeper. Wrong.

***"Elan"***

My breath caught. The speakers hissed.

***“You shouldn’t be here."***

The lights flickered. And then the room got cold.

I turned. And I wasn’t alone.

At the entrance of the secret room, a figure stood, tall and flickering like bad reception.

Its outline glitched in and out of focus, like it wasn’t fully in this reality. Its face was a blur of static.

And the sound wasn’t coming from the speakers anymore. It was inside my head. My vision blurred, like my brain was tuning in and out of a bad frequency. And my memory of the moment? Already felt fake.

Almost like it had never really happened.

I ran.

I don’t remember running.

I don’t remember getting back upstairs.

But suddenly, I was behind the front desk again, panting like I’d just run a marathon.

The radio was off.

The motel was quiet.

I just finished my shift, and I'm about to go home and attempt to get some sleep. *Which I doubt will be possible*, **so wish me luck.**

**Has anyone experienced anything like this before? If you know something about “the signals” or pirate radio stations, let me know. I swear this isn’t a joke...**

**I'll post again soon if I have any updates...or Warcloud...or the signals don't kill me first!**
