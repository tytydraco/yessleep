Hello, I’d like to share a story with you—something that definitely scared me, but scared my mother even more. She still gets chills whenever she hears it, and I usually tell it to a few friends. But this is the first time I’m telling it in full here.

Everything happened when I was eight years old and my brother was five. Even though I don’t remember many details, I clearly remember that it was a day when the streets were buried under mountains of snow. It was almost noon on an ordinary Saturday. My brother and I were playing in the yard out front, trying to build a snowman, each of us in a different corner of the yard. Our mother watched us as we played, her eyes occasionally drifting, heavy. It was the aftermath of a “long, boring day at work” the day before.

While I was finishing the snowman’s torso, my mom went back inside the house—probably to grab something or use the bathroom—leaving me, my brother, the snowman project, and Timmy (the name my brother gave to the snow angel he had made).

I was absorbed in my snowman, decorating it with stones and crooked sticks. Admiring my snowy Frankenstein, a truly twisted little monstrosity, I realized it was missing an essential part: its delicious carrot nose.

I looked around and saw there were no carrots anywhere. I had forgotten them inside the house. So I asked my brother if he could get some.

— Hey, Phill, can you ask Mom for a couple of carrots? — I said, already thinking that maybe a hat or scarf would look good on that crooked snow creature.

But Phill didn’t answer. Still focused on my project, I asked again. No response. I turned around and realized he wasn’t there anymore. Kids have a strange talent for disappearing the moment no one’s looking—and that was a serious problem right then.

I walked around looking for him, calling his name, but I couldn’t find him. Until I noticed the trees moving nearby.

For context: not far from our house there was a small forest where we used to play hide-and-seek. We were never allowed to go too deep, since our mom warned us constantly, afraid we’d disappear—just like the cases that showed up on TV almost every Friday afternoon.

I could see a yellow figure heading into the woods. It was my brother, wearing a bright yellow jacket—thick, with white fur lining the hood. A smart idea from my mother, using bright colors so she could spot her kids if she lost sight of them.

I ran past the edge of the yard, across the snow-covered ground, and into the forest with one goal: get my brother out of there before our mom came back. My teeth wouldn’t stop chattering, and the tree branches looked like long, sharp fingers, ready to grab me at any moment.

As dangerous as it sounds, I was familiar with that place. I knew every corner, every bush big enough to hide me and guarantee my victory in hide-and-seek.

Some things still give me an odd feeling when I think back to that day, and one of them is the sound that wouldn’t leave my head. I don’t know how to explain it—it sounded almost “magical,” like the exaggerated flutter of fairy wings. Too cheerful. Exactly like the sounds from toy commercials that played on TV in the mornings.

And after the sound, there was laughter. A thin, high-pitched laugh, as if it belonged to that little magical creature.

My body went on high alert. My heart pounded faster and harder. My eyes widened, my thoughts racing, all of them repeating the same thing: I need to find my brother now.

The sound came from deeper in the forest, always the same—lasting a few seconds, stopping, then starting again. The same laugh, at the same volume.

Instinctively, I moved toward what I thought was the source of the sound. And then I noticed something—Phill seemed to be doing the same.

I could see him, that small yellow dot drifting farther away, trying to blend into the white forest around us. I started running toward him.

When I finally reached him, it was as if touching him snapped him out of some kind of trance. I asked why he’d suddenly gone into the woods, warning him that Mom wouldn’t like it. He only made a gesture, signaling for me to be quiet—quiet so we could hear better.

A laugh.
That same laugh.

But that wasn’t all. Farther in the distance, if you strained your eyes, you could see a blinking light. It flashed in a hypnotic pattern. I felt like I could stare at it forever.

— There’s a fairy over there — my brother said, pointing at the light.

That was too strange. I grabbed my brother by the arm and turned around, determined to leave. But… when I looked back… I no longer knew where I was. I didn’t recognize the place, or even the way we had come.

I stopped for a moment, trying to decide which direction to go. I wasn’t sure, but the obvious choice was to head away from the light. Before I could take even one step, I heard branches snapping.

Our small hearts raced, pounding so hard it felt like they would burst out of our chests. For a moment, we froze, unsure whether to run or wait to see who—or what—was coming.

I thought it might be a wild animal. After all, I’d never gone that far into the forest before. I remembered what my mom had told us: if we ever encountered a dangerous animal, we should hide before it saw us. She always gave good advice. Even the obvious kind felt reassuring—because it came from her.

I grabbed my brother’s arm tightly and pulled him with me until we found a bush large enough to cover us. We had no idea whether we were heading back toward our warm home or sinking deeper into the beast’s lair, surrounded by trees that seemed eager to grab us.

We crouched there, the cold snow creeping up our legs as we tried to control our breathing. The damn vapor from our breath felt like a problem. I wasn’t completely naive—I remembered seeing an action movie where a guy hid in a forest and ate snow so his breath wouldn’t give him away. Trying to copy that tactic, I scooped up some snow and put it in my mouth, unsure whether I was supposed to swallow it or let it melt.

It tasted awful. I don’t know why I thought snow from the forest floor would taste even remotely okay. It was dirty, earthy, like it had bits of insects or wood splinters in it. At that point, I couldn’t throw up.

I did it anyway. Deep down, I knew I might be dealing with something more than just an animal—but I couldn’t decide whether I’d rather face a beast or a stranger.

The footsteps seemed to echo from every direction, and the so-called fairy sound now filled me with dread. I held Phill so tightly I worried I might hurt him. Every time the steps came closer, I shook harder and squeezed him just as much. He complained about the pain. I remember apologizing and telling him to be quiet. But in the brief moment I opened my mouth, I could hear the sound growing louder and louder. It was getting closer.

Suddenly, everything went silent.

An abrupt silence. The laughter didn’t even finish—it just stopped halfway through.

No fairies.
No laughter.
No footsteps.

We were far enough that we couldn’t hear cars anymore. So quiet I could hear my own heartbeat. So quiet I could hear my brother’s heart pounding against mine as he clung to me.

I waited. And waited. And waited. I waited for the perfect moment to leave.

When I heard a branch snap in the distance, I whispered to my brother that we needed to move—slowly. He nodded, already understanding the seriousness of the situation.

We crawled out of our hiding place, staying low, moving in what I hoped was the opposite direction of the light.

I had a plan. Phill’s yellow jacket was far too visible—if whatever it was came closer, it would spot us easily. So before it got any nearer, I took off my brother’s jacket. Then I ran with Phill, leaving that yellow dot behind in the middle of the white forest as a distraction. I watched a lot of movies, but I was still surprised by what my young mind managed to come up with in that moment.

As we ran farther away, my brother complained about the cold. The only thing I could think to do was give him my jacket. It wasn’t as noticeable—nothing like his flashy yellow one. Mine was black with red details.

Now the only thing keeping me warm was my thin dinosaur sweatshirt.

By then, we were lost, hoping our mother would find us. That was all we wanted. But the nightmare wasn’t over—far from it. We heard a sharp, piercing noise coming from where we’d been hiding. Something destroyed the bush we’d been crouched in. And then a scream—a scream of frustration. It was clear that whatever it was hadn’t been happy to find only my brother’s yellow jacket.

After that, I don’t remember much. We must have kept running for a while. I also kept up the stupid idea of eating snow to hide my breath, even though Phill wasn’t doing it anymore. We ran until our short legs couldn’t carry us any farther.

Then I noticed the path starting to make sense. Enough of the trees looked familiar. We were close to home. The nightmare was almost over.

Until everything went white.

I couldn’t see anything. But I clearly remember my body convulsing, my teeth chattering violently, my throat burning, and my legs barely able to move.

Drifting between consciousness and unconsciousness, I realized I was being carried, the snow beneath us sounding different—more packed, louder. A dark figure was taking me somewhere. All I could hear was a constant buzzing, as if the world had vanished. I only noticed their heavy clothing and a large boot crushing the snow, leaving deep footprints behind.

I wanted to scream, to struggle, but my body wouldn’t respond. All I could feel—besides the weight of my body against theirs—was that awful, dirty taste of snow they never tell you about. The sudden collapse had drained all my strength. Then, once again, everything went white… not before I felt my body collide with something hard, like frozen ground or a buried path. The impact took the last bit of consciousness I had left.

That disturbing buzzing.

I woke up in a bed—but not mine. It was a hospital bed. My skin burned with fever, my teeth rattling uncontrollably. In the middle of that storm of sensations, I heard the buzzing again, and beneath it, a familiar voice: my mother. She was holding my hand, squeezing it gently. Her face was marked with worry. I tried to speak, but my voice felt like it had been taken along with my strength.

We stayed there for a few hours, but soon we were discharged and went home. With a serious yet relieved expression, my mom asked why we’d suddenly gone into the forest. Not knowing where to begin, I simply said I’d gone in to get my brother—like any good older brother would. She smiled softly and let out a small laugh, as if she were proud.

My brother interrupted her, excitedly talking about the fairy he’d almost met in the woods. We laughed at his story, but our mother still looked worried, as if she knew something we didn’t. When I asked what was wrong, she shook her head and said that something strange had happened.

She told us she’d run into the forest, calling our names, her heart racing. She found Phill first—hidden, completely silent, unable to say where I was. Desperate, she went deeper into the woods, shouting, hearing nothing but the wind, snapping branches, and that awful sound of snow being crushed under boots. Until she heard a thud near the edge of the trees—it was me. Unconscious, without my jacket, nearly blue, close to dying from hypothermia.

My mother said she’d felt overwhelming relief when she found me. She hugged me tightly, saying she feared a wild animal might have reached me before she did—and that her worst nightmare was losing me. If she’d been even a little later, that terrible thought might have become reality.

Strangely, the fairy sound would sometimes return—but only when my mother was asleep or not home. Still, we never again had the courage to enter the forest and see what it really was.

And recently, when I thought back on this story, I noticed a detail that made me want to share it here.

I always told it as if, while I was unconscious, my mother had found me and carried me. But recently, thinking about it more carefully, I realized something that never made sense.

The boots I saw while I was being carried weren’t hers.

I remembered my mother’s boots well.

They were far too big.
