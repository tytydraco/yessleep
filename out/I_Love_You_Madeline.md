It was a Tuesday morning. I awoke to the sound of my alarm at 6:57 am, 12 minutes past the set time. Around the lining of my vision, there was a red haze, it was only small, so I brushed it off for my hay fever. I got out of bed with an ache in my hamstring, thinking to myself I must have slept in an awkward angle. I got myself out of bed. I slowly made my way downstairs to the kitchen to see Madeline making herself breakfast. Usually, mother would be there with her, but she wasn’t there. I asked her, “Where’s Mum”. She had replied in a soft tone, not taking her eyes off her cooking “She’s taken Father to the airport, she’ll be back before 2”. She was making avocado on toast. I decided to not hassle myself and get cereal. Before I could open the cupboard there was a screeching sound buried deep within my eardrums. I fell to the floor in pain. Through my squinting eyes, I saw Maddy look at me worriedly. She said something, but I couldn’t hear her over the sound of the screeching. I was in agony.

After about 2 minutes it faded, clutching the sides of my head I stood up. The red haze was stronger now. It was piercing my vision. At that point, nothing crossed my mind. I sat in the living room; I wasn’t hungry anymore. Madeline came in and sat next to me. She told me to put on the TV. I grabbed the remote. I pushed the power button and it turned to static. I looked at Maddy who hushed me to give her control. The moment it left my hand the television snapped into channel. It was 7:14 now. We watched the TV; Madeline was close to finishing her meal. Before she finished, I felt the same sensation but substantially worse. It felt like someone was pressing daggers into my temples, shoveling my brain from inside to out, trying to tug it out of my face. I fell to the floor in pure utter pain. Maddy jumped down to see if I was ok, the moment she touched my leg I felt instantly better. After I regained my sanity, I stood. Now just under half my Vision is Red, I felt like I had tunnel vision.

Madeline didn’t finish her meal and sat next to me in silence, with the bright TV in the background. On my right I heard a screech on a window, it sounded like metal. I couldn’t see directly due to the curtain blocking my vision. I turned to Maddy and asked if she heard anything, and she replied saying that she hadn’t heard a peep. After a couple of minutes, there was a light knock on my front door. I wasn’t going to miss this opportunity, I sprinted to the door and looked through the peephole to see nothing. I sat down but was on the edge of my seat. Madeline told me to relax and said that I was being paranoid. There was a crash of a window above our room. I stood up. Madeline grabbed my sleeve and told me to sit down. Steps slowly transitioned from above my head to the top of the stairwell. It was beside the door. It was 7:28.

The headache came back. I didn’t falter to the floor this time. I could feel my heartbeat on my face. I was building a cold sweat. The redness of my vision was pulsing to my heartbeat. In-Out, In-Out, In-Out. I could feel its presence. It was looking at me. I turned to face the door. The thing's beak lay past the light switch. Its claws dug into the doorframe. Its ominous white eyes digging into my soul. Madeline saw me looking at the door and turned. Without a murmur, her eyes returned to me in a distressed state. She was pale, a tear forming in her eye. She returned her eyes to lay on it. She moved closer towards me, frightened, looking for my protection.

It walked in. Each footstep was piercing my ears. Like a grenade, with shrapnel flying around you. You feel helpless. The Thing stood in front of Maddy its beak mere millimeters away from her face. She was full of dread. Its eyes pierced her soul. She let out a muffled scream and then immediately covered her mouth with her hand. Her eyes were full of tears as were mine. We locked eyes for the last time. The thing still looking at her grabbed her neck and lifted her above its head. Madeline couldn’t breathe. It moved its grip from her neck to the top of her head. With its other hand, it shot its hand into her neck and pulled out her oesophagus and windpipe. Dropping them below her feet. Maddy's eyes widened, still trying to breathe. The thing then changed its grip moving its hand above her chest. I knew what was going to happen, staring in full horror. The thing snapped her spine, separating it. With another tug, it pulled her remaining flesh apart, decapacitating her. Placing her head beside her other bloody remains. It wasn’t finished. It placed its hand on the inside of her ribcage. Pulling it apart with ease. It plunged its hand into her torso, pulling out her throbbing heart. It didn’t place her heart in the pile. It threw her lifeless body into the wall behind it, forming a pile of red-covered flesh. It held her faltering heart, opening its beak, and placing it inside. It consumed her heart tearing it apart while it chewed. It swallowed. I was frozen in utter shock. It paused for a few seconds. It was now 7:31. The thing slowly turned to me. Reaching its hand towards me.

I love you, Madeline.
