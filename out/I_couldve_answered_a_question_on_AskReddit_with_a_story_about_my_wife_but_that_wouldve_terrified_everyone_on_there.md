*Men of Reddit, what is something women hate about their bodies that you actually love?*

This subreddit seems a more fitting place for my story. Still, I suppose my answer involves one woman in particular, not women in general.

Mary, my wife, detests her body, and I once had the horrifying misfortune of learning why.

I didn’t see her naked until our wedding night. We’re not fundamental Christians or anything, but we had sex with the lights off for the first five years of our relationship. I never pushed her to get undressed in front of me because I was worried that she might be self-conscious of scars or blemishes.

“Believe me,” Mary said. “You don’t want to see me naked.”

“You know I love you for your amazing brain, your kindness, and your occasional wittiness, right?” I said, smiling. “I just also happen to think you’re smoking hot, and I’d love to see your body.”

“You wouldn’t, Will,” Mary insisted.

“I can already see your shape through your clothes. I know you’re sexy. There’s no need to be self-conscious,” I said.

“This isn’t… that,” She said. “Nobody must ever look at my body.”

“Well, okay,” I said. “And hey, if you want to stop seeing me naked, let me know. Solidarity, you know?”

“No chance of that,” She replied, grinning. “I wanna see that dad bod.”

“Really?” I asked. “I was planning on going to the gym, but all right. I guess I’ll keep up appearances.”

I always joked with Mary about her reluctance to undress in front of me. It always seemed to make her feel more comfortable with the topic. I just wanted her to know that she was safe.

And I could live with it because I loved her. At least I got to gaze at her cute, freckled face. That would’ve been enough, but on our wedding night, something outside of our control happened. Whilst we were doing the deed in a countryside B&B, the lights inexplicably flickered on.

I screamed, but my wife screamed *louder*.

I can’t put into words the petrifying feeling of finally understanding her secret. Mary’s naked form, upon being seen by human eyes, morphed into a wiry entanglement of veins, bloody meat, and bulging eyeballs, which surveyed me from her fleshless face.

It looked as if her body had been turned inside out with a flick of the light switch.“Honey…?” I whimpered.

Mary cried, seemingly wrestling with her own voice. “William… Run.”

The lights turned off again, and Mary froze on top of me, silently staring into my soul — I could vaguely distinguish her skinned outline in the sliver of moonlight pouring through the curtains. Her eerie stillness filled me with a paralysing fear.

“Mary?” I whispered.

“No.”

My wife’s cold, one-word answer haunted me, as did the giggle that followed.

Without a moment’s warning, Mary swiped at my face, drawing blood with her long, piercing nails. I yelled, overwhelmed by terror and pain, and rolled sideways.

Plummeting to the floor, and dislocating my shoulder in the process, I prepared to meet a terrible, unanswered end. What had become of the woman I loved? That was the terrifying question on my mind.

When I leapt to my feet and looked back at the bed, Mary had vanished. Not Mary, I reminded myself.

There was a sudden sniffing sound from the darkness, and the door to our room suddenly opened. Terrified, I briefly glimpsed my wife’s inside-out form flee the room in a hunched-over, animalistic pose.

A mixture of love and horror drove me into that hallway at 2am, and I witnessed something unthinkable.

My wife, or the thing that had taken the reins, pounced upon a lone businessman heading to his room. Her teeth sank into his neck so swiftly and savagely that he didn’t even have the chance to utter a sound. But the excruciating pain was evident from his wide-mouthed, wide-eyed face.

He was consumed alive. But, fortunately, the man quickly fell still and lifeless. Mary engulfed every last scrap of him, completely removing any evidence of her heinous crime, other than the bloodied carpet.

She looked up from the devoured carcass with vicious canines, eyeing me in a predatory way. I wore a gormless expression.

I didn’t expect to be eaten on my wedding night.

That was all I could think in what I assumed to be my final moments of life. I suppose I must’ve been in shock. But then my wife howled into the night as her inside-out form started to sprout fleshy patches through cracks and crevices, slowly and horrifically concealing the monster beneath.

Once the haunting transformation was complete and Mary had returned, she started trembling in a ball on the carpet. I turned on the light in our room, before quickly ushering her back inside. I barely even registered the fact that we had both been naked in the hallway. The blood-stained carpet seemed more attention-worthy.

To avoid arousing suspicion, we stayed at the B&B until the morning. An investigation was launched into the missing businessman and blood-stained carpet. Fortunately, nothing ever came of it. I suppose that must’ve been due to the combination of the small B&B in the middle of nowhere, incompetent police officers, and the lack of any CCTV cameras or substantial evidence.

But you don’t care about that, do you? You just want to know why I would even stay with Mary after that.

I love her, and I made a promise. For better or worse.

Besides, it isn’t Mary that I should fear when the lights come on. I don’t know what lurks beneath the surface of her skin. All I know for sure is that I completely understand why my wife hates her body.
