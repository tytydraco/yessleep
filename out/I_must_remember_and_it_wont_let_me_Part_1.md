I do not recognize the man in the mirror. Sure, he looks human, and I understand that he’s supposed to be me, but I’ve been banging my head against the wall for the past few hours trying to remember who the fuck I am.

To give a bit of context, I woke up this morning at around 7:00 a.m. That’s what my alarm was set to. I absentmindedly got out of bed, stretched, and headed toward the bathroom. It’s that lucid state right after you wake up, where you don’t realize you’ve started your day yet.

As I was brushing my teeth, a cold and unforgivably chilling realization started making its way from the back of my head, through my entire spine, and to the tip of my toes. I had forgotten who I was. I had no idea who was staring back at me in the mirror, and that petrified me. 

At first, I thought it was a dream, so, as cliché as it sounds, I checked my hands. For some reason I recalled that, your hands are never normal in a dream. Anyway, that’s unrelated because, sure enough, all of my fingers were there and my skin was normal. I was not dreaming.

I began ransacking what I supposed was my room, searching for any clue. Anything would do. You’d think that a normal person would at least have one thing that hints at their identity. Minute, incriminating evidence.

But there was nothing. Even my fucking phone was old. It had buttons for fuck’s sake. Buttons. And the worst part? As I was making a mess, a stench made itself at home seemingly out of nowhere. I paused my initial scavenger hunt as another one took its place. I didn’t have to search long, though. The source of the smell was staring right back at me.

Whose finger was that in my drawer?

It was a surgically cut-out finger. The nails were manicured and painted this faded red color, and judging by the overall size, it was most likely a woman’s. 

“So I have a woman’s finger in the drawer of my nightstand,” I remember telling myself.

But that was not all, unfortunately. Carved on said finger was the number five. So, as any sane person would, I placed the thing back in the drawer and made a quick stop to the bathroom, where I vomited everything that was in my stomach. Shit, I thought I’d vomit the organ itself too.

After a bit, with newly found determination that stemmed from God knows where, I began searching the rest of the apartment. The tight kitchen, the bathroom, and the small living room. 

All I could find were some photos of a child with two older people. I assumed they were my parents. I disassembled the frame and removed the back, and, sure enough, written on the back of the photograph was a name I guessed was mine. 

“Someone’s trip to the zoo,” I read out loud to the empty space, and subconsciously put it in my pocket.

See, the thing is, I know for a fact I read my own name back then. I figured it out. So how is it even possible that I don’t remember it now, two hours later? And yes, I checked the photograph again. Now it simply says “Trip to the zoo.” 

So, the sole evidence of my identity was erased instantly when I discovered it. Who even has the capability to do that? Not only was it gone from the photograph that, mind you, was in my pocket, but it was stolen from my brain, too.

To be frank, I still think I’m dreaming. I know it’s far-fetched and probably untrue, but it’s the only logical explanation I have. That, or I’m tripping on something really strong and really potent, although I don’t think I’m into that stuff.

And yes, I did check my phone too. There were no photos, and only one contact with no name. I obviously didn’t call because, for one, I had no clue who it could be, and also, what would I even say? Judging by the fucking finger in my drawer, I’m not exactly a perfectly normal individual, and it’s safe to assume that the mystery contact isn’t one either.

The whole search ended a bit later when I finally realized there was no hope. So what now? Well, I saw a bottle of whiskey on the kitchen counter staring back at me. 

And no, this is not a figure of speech. I swear, for a long, agonizing second, I saw two bloodshot human eyes staring at me through the bottle. My blood ran cold, and a shiver shot up my stomach, as if it wanted to become a projectile that’d be launched from my now wide-open mouth.

I jumped up and rushed towards it - a man with no name has nothing to lose - but nothing was there. Was I finally losing it?

I felt a strange familiarity as I grabbed the bottle’s neck. My left hand started shaking, too. I reluctantly opened it and took a sharp sip, downing the liquid that pleasantly burned my palate. 

Needless to say, I kept drinking, not enough to lose control, but just enough to make the situation more digestible. The pack of cigarettes next to the bottle was practically the equivalent of winning the lottery.

I sat on the cold and surprisingly hard pillow, trying my best not to think about my dire situation. The weather outside was cloudy, and small, somewhat soothing drops of rain raced down my living room window. 

I wondered if I was the only one in this situation. What if I wasn’t the only one who had no recollection of their past whatsoever? That thought was quickly dismissed because, if that were the case, havoc would rain down on the streets.

I’m writing this while sitting on the floor of my bedroom. Turns out, I had a laptop hidden under my mattress. That’s an unusual place to store a laptop, but still a great find. I haven’t investigated it yet. I jumped straight to Notepad as I was too afraid of forgetting again. Although this file would probably get erased if I did.

As I was sitting on the couch, I felt a liquid stain the back of my pants.

“Great, I fucking pissed myself too,” I said to myself.

I stood up and looked at the couch pillow. Since when was urine red? I held back the urge to throw up and lifted up the cushion. I guess I figured out who the finger belonged to. Her dead eyes looked back at me, devoid of any light.

The smell was unforgettable. It was so impossibly strong that I could even taste it. I swear, I thought I could hear the very particles being emitted from her corpse, too.

I don’t remember what happened next; my vision got all blurry, and I somehow ended up on the floor here after finding the laptop during my search for more dead bodies.

Now, I named this “I must remember, and it won’t let me.” You must be wondering: what is this thing that won’t let me? Well, I don’t know either.

But “it” has been staring at me through my half-open closet door ever since I got here, and I haven’t stopped staring back at it as I post this with trembling fingers. I’m paralyzed. If I move, I’m scared it’s going to jump out.

Please, has anyone had their memories stolen like this?
