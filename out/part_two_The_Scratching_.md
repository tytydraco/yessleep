Alright, I followed what some of you said. I started to get pans out of my cabinets and filling them with water. I put them in the kitchen. 



Next I've been tearing at the floor for hours and the scratching. still. won't. Stop. Section by section. Piece by piece and the scratching wont stop. Tap tap tap. Scratch scratch scratch. It just won't go away. I thought I was being clever by following the instructions to section off the floor trying to follow the thing that is making the noise. 



And finally, I've corned that horrible noise and as soon as I took my hammer to the floor an arm attached to nothing wormed its way into my living room. For it being just an arm it was surprisingly quick. As soon as it started to scurry around I ran for my gun and it tried to hide behind my couch scratching and clawing as it moved around. Blood dripped from its end. It looked like it belonged to an old lady with a silver ring on it. With that goo trying to cauterize the wound on the end. 



I shoved my couch and took my shot and missed the first time. As it scurred around. I think I spent twenty min before I was able to finally put some lead into it. As soon as I killed it pushed it out the hole in my door and then barricaded it back up. Then tried to cover the bullet holes as best as possible 



There is still a problem though and it's that damn scratching and tapping still hasn't stopped. I don't know if it's under the house but my floor has all been pulled up and that noise is still there. I've started to put the floor back though I'm doing a really shitty job but at this point I don't care i dont wanna see another one of those arms crawl its way through my floor. I've done my best to make sure there are no nails sticking up



The scratching is still just as loud as before. I've tried to cover my windows to keep those little things from looking in. I took some towels that I had nailed to make some makeshift blinds. But now I know that it's  a horrible idea. When one of the towels fell in the middle of the day the window was covered with those things and the moment it fell they scurried off like roaches. I got a better look at them, there longer than I thought. Almost like a thick snake, I'm thinking maybe that there are those hands but I'm not too sure. 



I've started to take down the towels and it startled me every time when those things either fell off or scurred off. They don't have the best grip when they move but flop kinda like a fish when they hit the ground. 



For now I'm going to hunker down and hope that someone gets my calls. For now this is still my only way to contact others
