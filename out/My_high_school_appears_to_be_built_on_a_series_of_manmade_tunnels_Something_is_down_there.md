First things first, I’m a (16 F) student attending school in the US.  I’m not revealing more than that, and any names I reference for this are made up aliases for the others involved.  So don’t bother asking.

My ex-boyfriend Raph (we’re still friends) was the one who put me up to write down our experiences over the last week and a half.  I’ve been dwelling on it for a few days and I finally decided - fuck it, why not.  Nobody will believe it anyways.

So here’s the deal.  I attend a pretty run-of-the-mill highschool, kind of a rural area.  I’ve been there for two and half years now, and while school seems pretty normal there, the building itself is quite old and somewhat unusually designed… I think it might have used to be a supermarket or big box store?  But we still need to go to the county recorder and find out, so I’ll leave another update once we do that.  You immediately get the sense that every classroom was created by just erecting walls in what was originally one giant space.  The extremely high ceilings are the dead giveaway, and first thing you’ll notice.  Keep this in mind for later.

Another thing to note is that my hometown has a bit of a weird history.  About sixteen years ago, there were a string of disappearances, something like a dozen teenagers all vanished on the same night.  They were never found, far as I know, and the police decided they had likely run off together since they were all part of the same clique and ran in the same social circles.  That was mostly the end of it, as it had never happened before and hasn’t happened again since.

Remember that as well.  For later.

Now with all that out of the way, let’s start with what happened last week.

Me and three friends (we’ll call them Lisa, Kate, and Sue) were driving around looking for a good place to get high not far from my house.  Usually we’d just go to the woods somewhere, lots of backroads where you can park anywhere and no one is going to come by.  It was after midnight, and we passed the school on our way to one of our usual hangouts.  I think it was Sue who noticed every door (there are several on the front) was wide open, despite it being pitch black inside.  Now this was doubly unusual, because usually the lights are kept on at night, I guess for the janitors or whatever.  Well, I’m a sucker for putting my nose where it doesn’t belong, so like a dumbass I immediately suggested we check it out.

We’re a pretty brazen bunch, the kind of kids who have been sneaking around and breaking the rules for years.  After a couple dares regarding who would sneak in and scout, we agreed that we’d all go in together, like some kind of exploration team from a movie or something.  I mean, it was just our school, so I wasn’t really expecting anything.

As we drove into the parking lot, I remember getting a weird feeling.  It’s a bit hard to describe… just like, something was off.  An easy enough thing to ignore.

We parked in the most obscure spot, then made our way to the closest set of double doors.  There’s three sets of them, all glass of them, with a large glass face between each of them.  As we saw from the road, they were still all open.  And still, no lights inside.  So phones on flashlight mode, we took a few steps in and shouted to see if anyone was there - figured we’d still have plausible deniability at that point if anyone caught us.  The place still echoed despite the interior walls the school had added, but nobody replied.  After a few minutes and several more tries, we got a bit rowdy and pushed Kate in to take the lead.  But we followed right behind.

It was… uncannily dark.  Like, I can’t tell you for certain, but it almost felt like our lights were just sort of being absorbed.  Like the place was eating them  As if the black was a miasma that had its own substance.  I didn’t say much about it at the time, it was easy enough to write off as my overactive imagination.

We spent about an hour exploring.  First thing we discovered is that every interior door was unlocked and open as well.  We explored a few, found the main office, Sue got the idea that we should totally see if you can go through the principal’s desk.  We talked her out of it and kept looking around.

I’ll spare you the boring parts - most of it was just the same yawn-inducing classrooms we’d seen a thousand times before.  I’d pretty much written the whole thing off by the end of the hour.  Maybe it had all been left open for some midnight cleaning crew or repairmen?  Seemed logical at the time.

The first thing of interest we discovered - right as we were about to call it quits - was a door we’d never seen before.  It was inside one of the maintenance closets which are usually locked.  Both the closet door and this inner door were both wide open, like all the rest.  And beyond that just a concrete stairwell.  We took a look, but our flashlights couldn’t reach the bottom without going in.  After some quick debate, we decided to see if the building had a basement and what was in it.

So down we went.

When we found the sublevel, it was similarly all concrete, and almost entirely empty aside from some abandoned furniture and boxes stacked in a corner.  There was another metal door though.  Also open.  We peeked.

Another stairwell.

This was when Kate started complaining about wasting too much time, but I think the place was starting to creep her out.  She worried out loud about whether someone was going to show up and catch us.  But I was committed.  So I volunteered to scout it out while they waited.

This descent was longer than the last.  Significantly longer.  I considered turning back at one point, but convinced myself I wouldn’t give Kate the satisfaction of me chickening out without seeing what was down there.

So down I went.

There was a bottom, of course.  It took me ten minutes to reach it.  I’m not sure what depth that would have put me but it was a lot.  I expected it was some sort of old bomb shelter, so was a bit surprised when it looked like a tunnel carved from natural rock.  That sense of something not being quite right returned.

There was a smell, too.  I have since tried to figure out what it was, but I can’t say I have ever encountered anything quite like it before… sort of a petrichor (yes, I always liked that word) if the rain had been mixed with gasoline.

The tunnel went both ways, disappearing into the darkness.  I took a few pictures and left, back up the stairs.

About halfway up, I heard something behind me.  It sounded a bit like footsteps, but whoever was producing it was either extremely tall or moving extremely slowly, because the cadence of the gait was long.  I’ll admit it spooked me.

I ran back up, stopping near the top to listen again.  Nothing.

Then I closed the door and tried to lock it.  But there was no lock.  At least, not on the outside.  I cracked it open and shined my light, and there, on the inside of the door, was a turn-lock.

That was very, very weird.

Even more disconcerting, there was no sign of the others, aside from the strong dank smell that lingered as proof they’d smoked without me.  In the school’s basement, even!  An annoying thought so I chased them back upstairs.

I didn’t find them at the car, though.  I tried calling them one by one, but nobody picked up.  I sent texts.  Nothing.

I went back to the school’s front doors and shouted.  No reply.

I turned and screamed their names into the night.  No reply.

“Guys, this isn’t funny!”

Footsteps, again.  That long gait.  Upstairs, in the school’s halls this time.  It echoed.  I pointed my light down the hallway, but that pitch black consumed it.

“Hello?”

Nothing.  But the steps drew closer.

I backed away, slowly.

Remember how I told you that the school had bizarrely high ceilings?  It was only an off chance that I noticed the two beady reflections, revealed at the edge of the light.  They were high, very high above the floor.  Eyes.

They were eyes.  I’m certain.

They moved closer with every improbable step.  And I had a feeling that whoever they belonged to was not someone - no, something - I wanted to meet.

But it was the burp that did me in.  Long and drawn, it echoed, and it stung.  Like a bloody retch, or lingering groan beneath water.  That smell of rain and oil grew.

I sprinted for the car, fumbled for my keys, and got the fuck out of there.  But as I drove away, I saw those eyes watching through those tall glass windows.  Bent sideways even, as if someone crouched to look.  I can still see it, even now, like it’s burnt into the back of my eyelids.

It’s been many days now.  School resumed normally the next day, but I stayed home sick.  My friends still haven’t shown up.  Still.  I have been hesitant to inform the police in person, but I did send an anonymous letter to them with everything I know.  I doubt they will take it seriously.

The only person I have dared to confide with is Raph.

He didn’t believe me at first.  But he did remind me of the missing students who had attended our school sixteen years ago.  He wondered if maybe it’s related, some serial killer or kidnapper back on the prowl again.  It was a disturbing idea, but it didn’t last long.  Because he asked if I’d taken any pictures.  I said I had.  And he asked to look.  I’d nearly forgotten about them.

I’m not sure what to do with them now.

But he spotted the two little beady eyes in one of them, down when I was at the very bottom.  And when you turn up the contrast, you can just barely make it out.

Grotesque, emaciated limbs as long as a person is tall, twisted as it huddled at nearly a crawl in that deep, dark tunnel beneath the school.  But that is not the thing that bothers me the most.

It’s the face.

I’m looking at that picture again right now.  I can’t stop looking at it.

What the fuck?

I don’t know what to make of it, but it scares the living shit out of me.  I’m standing in front of the mirror, staring at my own reflection, phone in hand, just trying, trying, trying to make sure.  To make sense of it.

But I know that face too well.


It’s mine.


I know I have to go back.  I have to.  But first I’m going to find every scrap of information about that building, get together a group, proper equipment, and bring a few of my father’s guns.

Then, we’ll find my [friends.](https://www.reddit.com/r/adarksobright/)
