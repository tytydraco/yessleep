Has anyone else heard the story of the One-Eyed Fiddler?



My mother died when I was 10. An undiagnosed heart condition is what the doctors said. Sudden, unpreventable. And this post, while I dedicate it to her, is not about her. It is instead about a story she read to me several times throughout my childhood. A fairytale would be the best way to describe it. An odd, albeit entertaining bedtime story. I can't remember the first or the last time it was read to me, but I remember she would always read it out of a dusty leather back book she kept on her shelf. She would read other tales from this book as well, such as Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, the like. But what separates the One-Eyed Fiddler from the rest is that, to my knowledge, my mother was the only person who ever told it.



I wasn't made aware of this till about a few weeks ago. Me and my roommate were watching a horror movie in our dorm when I mentioned the plot of it was similar to the aforementioned fairytale. He gave me a quizzical look and asked me what I was on about. As I told him more about the story, the look on his face proved that this was his first time hearing it. Later, I asked a couple of my other friends if they had heard of the fairy tale, to the same response. Then, I googled it. No results. I combed the local library to no avail. No one had any notion of the story anywhere.



Something about this didn't sit right with me. I thought perhaps that it was a sort of.. Familial story, something that had been passed down in Mom’s family for generations. It didnt explain why she read it from that book, but it was the best explanation I could think of.



To try and confirm my suspicions, I got in touch with my Grandma. When I asked her about the story, however, a blank and confused stare was the only answer I got. She told me she had never heard of it. My Grandma is a tough woman, but she’s nothing if not honest. Sometimes even too honest, in my opinion. But if she hadn’t heard of it, then where did my Mother find such a gruesome and detailed tale? Did she make it up on the spot? From what I remember, my Mom wasn't much of a writer. I’ve asked some of my other family members, and none remember anything about the tale. If my mother had made up the story, why did she read it only to me? And it still wouldn't explain the book. I remember reading along with her, us both muttering the typed words from the worn pages. 



I’ve tried to find it. I’ve scoured the house, asked everyone even remotely in the bloodline. There’s no trace of it anywhere. In fact, I seem to be the only one who ever even remembers seeing the thing. Somewhere in the chaos surrounding my mother’s death, the book had seemingly vanished out of existence. It was gone just as suddenly as she was.



So that’s why I’m writing this. To see if anyone else has heard of the story, and in a certain sense, to preserve my mother’s legacy. I’m giving this story from memory, but it has been well wormed into my brain from the countless times she read it to me in my childhood. Without further ado, here is the tale of the One-Eyed Fiddler.



Once upon a time, there was a very small town on the edge of a very dark wood. The town was a happy town, a simple town. The townsfolk lived their lives in peace, raising crops for themselves, trading with nearby settlements, and thriving as a whole. Every night in the town, a beautiful melody would drift out from the woods. A soft lullaby that seemed to bring prosperity and luck to the townsfolk. Everyone knew where it came from. The fiddler could be seen dancing on the edge of the woods at night, his form shifting through the trees and his one eye gleaming like a candle in the dark. However, as all good things do, the luck bringing song came with a catch. Once a year, the townsfolk had to send a young girl out into the woods, no older than 5 or 6, in order for their luck to continue. These girls were never seen again, lost to the gaping maw of the black forest. No one else was allowed to enter.



The town continued like this for many centuries until the day a little girl named Lena was picked to be sent out into the woods. Lena had a sister named Emmeline, born just a few hours before her. She could not bear to see her younger sister go off to such a fate, but she was unable to prevent the townsfolk from forcing Lena out into the woods. So she decided to seek the advice of the old woman at the edge of town. There were many nasty rumors about this hag, most of them true. However, when the old crone saw Emmeline weeping over the loss of her sister, her cold heart was turned to pity her. She beckoned the girl into her hobble and began to speak.



“Listen, and listen well, my child. There is a way to save your sister, but you will need to follow my advice very carefully. I will give you four things. Four objects that will deliver you and your sister from the clutches of the fiddler. The first is the stone, when you arrive in the forest, throw it into the trees. It will startle the nesting birds, and the way they fly will be where the Fiddler’s house is. The second is the salmon. Once you are outside, you must burn the fish to lure the Fiddler away from his home. Once you are inside, you will need this, the oil. You will know what it is to be used for when the time is right. Lastly, the wax. You must plug it in you and your sister’s ears as you escape. The Fiddler’s broken bones are too weak to catch you, but he will try to lure you back with his song. Run directly away from the front of his house, and do not stop. If you follow these instructions well, you and your sister shall leave the forest alive.”



With that, the hag placed the items in Emmeline’s satchel and sent her off. As the girl came to the mouth of the woods, a horrid breeze echoed out from within. It chilled her to her bones, but the thought of her sister warmed her enough to go on. Once inside, the girl looked to the trees and threw her stone. The stone flew straight as an arrow, jostling the branches and disturbing the birds from their slumber. The shrieked and screamed, and flew off into the air, headed to the north. Emmeline followed, fighting her way through the snake like thorns and choking darkness.



As she came upon the Fiddler’s house, Emmeline began to hear a horrid noise. A terrible metal scraping, a clanging and clashing of rusty gears. Along with it, her sister’s shrill screams. With great haste, Emmeline struck up a small fire and laid the salmon upon it. The smoky smell filled the woods, unnatural amidst the smothering air.  The scraping and screaming stopped, and Emmeline hid in the thrush as the door of the Fiddler’s home creaked slowly open. The girl could not bring herself to look upon the thing as it lumbered its way towards the fish, dragging its viola and bow behind it. The instrument and bow were oversized, fitted to the thing’s massive form. Its bow had snapped, the leather finally worn away from a full year of playing. Emmeline snuck past the squirming creature, slipping in through the giant door of the shack. 



The house was almost bare, save for one terrible sight. The Fiddler’s workshop, where he would tune and restring his viola. In the middle, a horrific contraption lay, the sight of which almost made Emmeline turn pale with fear. A long metal frame, with wheels and cogs at both ends, rusted and pungent, attached to a hand crank at the base. A rack, with her sister upon it. Lena had been stretched to an unnatural length, her skin tightening against her bone as she was malformed against the cold steel. She was to be the new string for the Fiddler, her body stretched into leather for his bow. 



 Emmeline approached her sister, unsure of how to save her from such a state. But when her eyes laid upon the hand crank, she had an idea. If this machine could transform her into such a state, then surely it could reverse the effects. As she approached the crank, however, she had a realization. The gears of the machine were old and rusty, and the screeching and scraping would surely alert the fiddler. She realized what she had to do. She took the oil from her satchel and carefully applied it to the cogs of the rack, smoothing them. Emmeline then began to turn the hand crank backwards, and her sister was slowly morphed back into form. Lena’s skin creeped back upon to her bones, her form shortening until she was herself again.



Quickly, Emmeline plugged both her and her sister's ears with wax. They bolted out of the cabin, their little legs carrying them as fast as they could. As they passed the Fiddler, Emmeline finally was able to see its face. One pale green eye stared at her, bulging out of its socket. The other was an empty hole, in which nothing but squirming maggots resided. Although it carried the face of a man, the thing had no ears or mouth. Or rather, no visible mouth. The skin had grown over the creature’s maw, the thin layer pulsing with its muffled cries. Still, jagged and mismatched teeth ripped through the skin of where the thing’s mouth should be, poking through the soft flesh like stalactites.The Fiddler scowled and raised its viola, and brought its bony fingers to the strings. Even with the wax, Emmeline and her sister could still hear the faint notes being played. The notes sounded of dreams long forgotten, and smelled of a pleasure that never existed. But the sisters resisted the song and continued their sprint.



As the two exited the forest, a ripping of flesh could be heard, and a large screech echoed from the depths of the wood.



Emmeline and her sister moved far away from the town, living their lives away from the horrid edges of the dark woods. No more music was heard at night in the town after that day. Instead, only the howling and screaming of a maddened beast.
