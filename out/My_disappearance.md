hello. If you’ve found this audio log, then I guess its bad news for me. I want tell my story as a warning to you. Let’s start at the beginning. My name is Travis, and I’m a detective who mainly handles cases of homicide.

Three weeks ago, I was called in to investigate a persons death. It was night when I arrived. It also happened that there was a thunderstorm currently going on.There were two police cars outside the house. I stepped out of my car and into the pouring rain. Immediately one of the officers emerged from inside the house and greeted me. He looked like he had seen a ghost.

”Oh, you’re here,” he said while shaking my hand. “My names officer Williams,” He stated. I replied, “Names Travis.”

As we walked towards the house I started to notice how beat up it was. At first glance it looked like a regular house, though it definitely needed a paint job. But while looking closer it was apparent something had happened to it. There were scratch marks on the walls, the door had been broken in, and there were weird hoof- like prints int the mud, but they were bigger than that of any deer I’d seen.

Officer Williams noticed my confused look and said, “Oh yeah, the house, think this is bad, just wait till you see the inside.” As I walked sure enough the inside was even worse. claws marks in the walls, scratches on most surfaces, those same hoof prints on the ground and blood everywhere.

As I stared in horror at the destroyed living room, Williams started filling me in on what had happened. “We think some kinda bear must of broken in and attacked, but I’ve never seen bear that could do this,” he said while gesturing at the room.

“Neither have I,” I admitted. We pointed at another door way, to what I guessed was a bedroom. “Bodies in there,” he said. I walked towards the door, and the awful smell of blood that had been filling the room got worse with each step I took to the battered doorway.

This door had been broken down too. I looked back and saw Williams stand there with nervous look on his face. “You coming?”, ”No,” he replied.

Personally I preferred that. I like being able to work by myself. I walked in and the smell of blood was upped ten fold, but there wasn’t that familiar smell of a corpse. Just blood. I looked around and immediately realized why. Laying on the bed was a bloody skeleton. There was no flesh. Just blood and bone. I was confused. Judging by how fresh the blood was, this couldn’t have happened more than a day or two ago.

I looked around for more evidence of would could have done this, an found more claw mark, and more of those damn hoof prints. After a while of looking around the room, and exploring the rest of the dilapidated house officer Williams said, “It’s probably best we get going” I agree with him on that, something about that house felt wrong.

As we went to leave, right before we were gonna say our goodbyes there’s was a loud crash that sounded like shattering glass. Both of us instinctively took out our guns and pointed them at the house. We slowly made our way in and we heard the sound of crunching bone. It was coming from the bedroom. I looked inside and what I saw still haunts me to this day. There was a tall pitch black figure with long claws sharp fangs, and a deer skull for a head. But worst of all, it had glowing white eyes. The horrible thing was eating the skeleton that had been laying on the bed. The it turned to me.

\*Bang, bang\* don’t worry that door will still hold, anyway, It stared at me, It’s glowing white eyes seemed to pierce my soul. Then there was a flash lightning, and I saw the true terror that was standing in front of me. It was thin, it looked malnourished, it had grey skin, and a huge mane of hair going down its neck and upper back, and deer like hooves for feet. It screeched, a loud gurgling awful noise, and made a strange demonic shriek that while gurgled and scratchy was unmistakable, “Get Out!”

I fired three shots straight into the things skull. But it didn’t even seem to notice. I turned around and ran as fast as I could. I managed to make it into my car and drive away. As soon as I got home I locked all my doors in hid in my room. I stayed awake the whole night.

In the morning I felt better. For the next couple days I slowly started feeling better. Then it happened.

I was sitting at home making myself some tea and reading when suddenly I got the feeling I was being watched. I looked outside and nothing was there.

This feeling wouldn’t go away so I kept looking, then I saw it. Two glowing white dots staring at me from the trees. I closed my blinds and try to ignore it, it was probably like a deer or something.

But this kept happening. I would feel like I was getting watched and it would at me through the windows. For day I was terrified of looking outside even during the day. Each time the eyes would get closer. \*Bang Crunch\*

Looks like that thing finally broke through the door. If you find this, run and hide. That thing might still be here. And if it is \*sounds of screeching and loud footsteps\* you‘re next. \*A loud demonic shriek and then the audio cuts out.
