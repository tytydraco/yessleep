This wasn't supposed to be posted here.
This was supposed to be one of the many endless nights scrolling through reddit, or whatever, but what has happened just two days ago,

I just had to tell someone.

I'm not a really remarkable person or student, even by my school's very low effort standards I just can't get to know more than what's required to pass the school year or exam

This little fact made me advance to my final and
(Have the care to imagine a series of drums playing in unison, please)awaited fifth grade as an IT student in programming and telecommunications!!

Not really fond of the choice I made, apparently I'm not the type of guy to sit in front of a computer for 8 hours a day to work, but as the school years progressed seemingly out of nowhere I was just too late to change school.

As it wouldn’t have made any significant difference in my life

 and as I said, it's not like my school was harsh or anything.

After a while the monotonous school days blurred together in one concise grayish block of time, factually trivial and useless to remember or, as it  just became clear to me this last year of purgatory, to attend to.

Because our professors checked who was present exclusively during the first and last hour of school, and also because most of my classmates either supported my initiative, or couldn’t bother to care, sneaking out of the classroom and out on the deserted streets was dumbindingly easy.

Seeing how was life operating while I should be in school was weird, 

just the sight of the road in front of school’s entrance, who led directly to some well known landmarks, usually bustling with sightseeing buses and taxis during the afternoon, empty like during the pandemic, was exceptionally eerie,

Even the sidewalks weren't too populated  and the absence of other students mounting over the door to start the school day, got me a better look at the cigarettes buts carpet layd under my feet.

I would have never thought this well awaited freedom would give me such amazed curiosity over such mundane stuff, and over time it consolidated into some sort of thrill for wandering.

As I gave into it the joys of exploring new and “untouched” places and locations got me in a frenzy,

the only fact of discovering new ways to get home, by mostly taking extreme reroutes through private areas and unbuild construction sites, almost made me believe i got back some sense of unlimited and childlike wonder that I never thought I ever had even in kindergarten;

the illusion to be somewhere else, like scouting alone the surface of dangerous foreign planets far from home, or being in the center of an amazonian rainforest, ready to face off the indigenous cannibal that..YES

the local urban stories foretold you about when you first set foot on the muddy and soft dirt track of the lost village off Axacuzok..

 or whichever name sound more adventurous to you; and just how the treeline seemed to go on and on and on forever in the fresh mist formed in the first hours of the rising sun.

Now, it couldn't have lasted long, once used to the now cold concrete roads the sense of setting foot into some sort of wild “urban forest” disappeared,

 and after that the vastness of space becomes more welcoming and warm than the limited possibilities on this planet.

On one of my latest escapes I couldn't even bother to come back to school, as time managed to pass effortlessly through an open field near home,

 as I laid bored and contemplative on just how similar the day has been ever so dull as one of my regular school days, as just for a set of minor details that made the day more draining than anything;

1-While contemplating I couldn't shake off the feeling of being watched, interpreted as flocks of tourists just being curious or worried for my motionless slumber but as of writing this most things are falling back into piece;Like a detective before the grand finale of a great movie, it can all boil down on..

2-The roads didn't feel the same as yesterday, or any other time I passed the long and tortuous road across overgrown grass beds and the megalithic ruins to get in the tourist flooded streets, the asphalt was..

 a lot better preserved and cohesive, 

Rome is justly famous for the decadence of his public road, and the fact that it seemed a cohesive slab of gray all the way home, definitely meaning to have been renewed recently, even if there were no blocks or deviations for, I simply forgot about it while cycling home;

The biggest problem was that it all piled up on a bigger and unnerving issue, being that

3-It was starting to rain, and because the tires of my bike weren't made for slippery paths, the trip back home was going to be painfully slow and steady.

As the day ended the unnerving sensation of being watched, as most things I have the exquisite pleasure of  experience, got first sidelined by a futile worry or curiosity and then set along the horizon as our bright and weary star does; it was around 7 pm, and I still remember the sequence of events, that lead me to transcribe this personal journal, almost perfectly.

my bicycle was running through the big and empty straight road to my house sounding like a thunderstorm across the wet and puddle ridden street, appearing like an invisible phantom to the car driver who was passing on the perpendicular road a kilometer away from my destination when our sight crossed, appearing invisible with my lights turned off.

His headlights beaming my silhouette away as fate was unveiling my crude, bloody and contorted future; call it an act of providence, or sheer luck, but the car didn’t hit me;I was still feeling my feet pushing the bike pedals and the horn of the poor driver in the previous silent night even after a good three seconds since our accidental meeting.

until the feeling came back, this time I could feel it’s presence like a snake crawling in between my feet, the warm breath condensating like an ill mist just above it’s  horned head;the gigantic figure standing statuary just next to the car, seeming nothing more than a mutt in comparison, barking it’s mechanical mouth with beastly anger at his owner.

and his owner responded with thundering fury by smithing the poor metal animal with a leg so slim it speared the hot engine through making the whole system ignite in hell fire, engulfing them both in the explosion. 

Just in that moment, adrenaline and fear finally arrived at the awaited destination, sending me flying on the asphalt like an f1 racer pushing with whatever strength I could have had just to get out of that monster line of sight, my mind having prepared a complete map of  anywhere l could have gone to make sure to not be his next victim.

noticing the small metal frame of my bike speeding in front of him, maybe mistaking it for another pray to slaughter tonight or maybe infuriated by the chain’s metallic sound while escaping his presence, must have set the monster in a frenzy as I could feel the the earth shaking with every single step his titanic frame hammered on the ground;

I could could hear the sound of the creature’s knuckles scraping the asphalt, akin to the fangs  of wolves running frantically onto gravel;

I could smell his breath while trying to keep up the pace, panting vigorously his cadaveric odor onto my shoulder and spine;

the distance between the two never so close yet so unattainable as we both kept running for what could have been onto the never ending road, what should have took less than a minute now elongated to uncanny extent,and  my gaze, never able to be lifted from it may the monster following demolish me demolish with only his stare, noticing how the green leaves merged together as if them too where stretched to assure my failure in this impossible chase through the now fixed and moonless black canvas I found myself under, surpassing even the stars.

The only thing stopping this never ending march was the materialization of a cat, black fur and invisible to my then panicked escape, just in front of my bicycle and almost making me lose control of it;

running that fast I would have never bet on whether I would have hit the ground or not, to what was certainly my demise.

It all happened so suddenly that I don't really remember how I found myself alive and writing this, and trust me I’ve tried all kinds of methods to dig out details and feelings on these last events but my mind just gets lost and wanders, not capturing the picture in the exact same
way as it was, down to feelings and sensations and stuff, presenting me this clear cut between our running and..

Me, motionless, watching as he disappears behind the treeline after taking his latest victim.

Of one thing I'm certain, out of everything that hasn’t been left out or forgotten is the subsequent bizarre calmness of seeing the head and torso of the cat squashed onto the street, the abrupt flash forward between me cycling for my life and seeing the small red puddle are my last memory of the event.

This is the type of thing that I needed,

This is the type of thing that I must experience again,

 the days since then have been ten times more colorful, joyfully spending school hours imagining possibilities or secret meanings perhaps;

What was it?

Why was it?

I've backtracked the same street of my first contact to put markers on each line of events  that followed my first sighting.

The car was gone and so the cat

could it be that the creature came to get them after disappearing?

The nature of that beast is certanly supernatural, and yet why steal the car and hide that cat carcass?

This obsessing is so strong,

 so persistent

that every inch of where I live, or where I've usually been on my endless journeys during school hours, has been mapped and catalogued from most to least possible presence of It.

Where could the thing that has opened this new chapter in my life has become my newest obsession,

Nothing has ever gave me such a thrill on life, I just had to write this, even as proof of the event and as a way to preserve it.

I just had to tell someone.
