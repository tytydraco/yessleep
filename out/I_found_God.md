I need to do something with my hands, with my mind. I need to pretend like anything that's happened makes sense.

My name is Adam and I need someone to know.

Monday

I hated my job. Not anything about the work itself, but all the insufferable constants surrounding it. I worked retail, Lightning and Lights. We sold batteries and lightbulbs, one step away from being obsolete like radio shack. We were lucky if we had a plural number of customers before we closed at 7 pm. 

I don't think it was the stores’ fault, we were in a desolate location. A small corner store in a small town in bum fuck nowhere Missouri. Saint Joseph Missouri. 

The work itself I could handle fine. I swept, I stocked shelves, I even tested car batteries without issue. The things I hated were my coworkers. Beth, my boss, was a bored real estate agent who decided it would be a good idea to buy into a retail franchise after she divorced her husband of 14 years. Normally she was pleasant enough, but considering the lack of effort it requires to run a store with no customer base, she found herself with nothing to do most days and just micromanaged.

Dale, the cashier, was just an asshole. He wouldn't do anything besides watch LiveLeak videos at full volume during his entire shift. Shockingly, I'm not a fan of listening to people get into car wrecks on my lunch break so we didn't have much to talk about most days. I'm pretty sensitive to noise in general, a fact he was keen to criticize me for frequently.

It was just us 3, the store was about as big as a 2 car garage so we didn't need that many people. Shift wise I was the opener, I unlocked the door at 7 am and “worked” by myself until noon, at which time Dale was supposed to show up so I could go to lunch. My shift should end at 3 pm, leaving Dale to close up shop at 7 pm. It very rarely happened like that though. At some point Dale got into the habit of leaving before my shift was supposed to end and texting me that there was an “emergency” he had to deal with, leaving me to close. 

Honestly, I welcomed it. I was getting paid overtime for essentially no work and I didn't have to deal with Dale. Beth only ever came in to check in on us on Wednesdays, she never asked about the overtime so I think she already knew I was doing it. And it wasn't like I had anything better to do.

I met “him” on a Monday.

It was a dull day like always, half an hour away from closing. I finished sweeping and mopping that morning. No one, not even Dale, had walked in the door. Another “Emergency” of course. I was reading a book… I don't remember what it was about. It doesn't matter now. I was startled when I heard the chime of the front door. In walked what appeared to be a very short, old man. According to the height indicator sticker on the door, He barely clocked in at 5’0. He was bald and his skin was sun damaged. His skin wrinkled around his neck, like he had lost a large amount of weight recently. The fact he wore a dress shirt and pants that were a size too large for him lead credence to this theory. I cleared my throat and greeted him.

“Hello sir! Anything I can help you with today?”

He looked at me like I was a novelty and smiled without showing his teeth. 

“Oh no, I'm just gonna look around.” 

“Alright, let me know if you need anything.”

He wasn't the first old person to walk around the store with no intention of buying anything. I had seen them before, old people that had nothing to do during the day other than… wander. I remember thinking he had probably outlived everyone he ever knew growing up. 

I had to pay attention to him though, if he stole something I wouldn't hear the end of it from Beth. I followed his slow movements across the store floor. Eventually, he disappeared behind our only standing shelf, a feat only possible thanks to his small stature. I waited for what felt like minutes for him to move… but he didn't. I sat there, the only noise audible being my own breathing. I was sitting at the front desk behind the register, it would have been weird for me to stand up and try and find an old man within spitting distance of me. I looked at my watch and decided to keep reading until the store closed. My eyes glanced at my book for what felt like seconds before I felt like someone was watching me.

The old man was standing at the counter. He made no noise when he moved. I was startled back into customer service mode.

“Oh! Uhh… did you need something sir?”

The man looked at me like I was a parked car on the side of a freeway.

“I was wondering if I could get some advice about a project.” 

He spoke like he was trying to remember how words worked. 

“Uh sure. What kind of project are you working on?” 

I remember my mind trying to recall the 20 minute PowerPoint about light grading I had to sit through for training.

“Well that's the problem actually, I haven't started working on it yet. It's just that there are too many options to choose from, I don't even know where to begin!”

I remember silently dreading the old man wanting an excuse to talk my ear off so close to closing time. 

I made a mistake in saying something I shouldn't have.

“Well… if you're having a problem with choice paralysis, something that helps me sometimes is to think about the ending, rather than the beginning.”

“Oh?”

The man looked at me like a child seeing a dog for the first time.

“Sure! If you start from the end, you can see what you need to do to get to that ending easier. It tricks your brain into solving smaller, immediate problems rather than getting hung up on the big picture. Works for me anyway.”

I held up my book as a prop to accentuate my point.

“People remember endings more than beginnings after all.”

The old man stood silently after I weaved my made up philosophy.

“The ending is more important… I like that… I like that a lot!” 

The old man waved his pointer finger at me. He then asked me my name.

“Adam.”

“Well, Adam, I think you make an excellent point!”

“Glad I could help.”

The old man turned and started walking towards the door. He stopped and turned back towards me.

“Will I be able to find you here if I come back?”

“Uhh.. Yeah… yeah I'll probably be here.”

I remember making myself sad when I said that. 

“Wonderful… you'll be able to see the ending.”

I remember being too self conscious about my life to ask any follow-up questions to the old man before he walked out. At 7 pm I locked the front door and started my walk home. Part of the reason I even got the job was because it was within eyesight of my rental. I saw the “now hiring” sign be put up. I'm pretty sure I was the first to apply. 

Lucky me. 

I got home, showered, ate, and was on my phone by 8 pm. I didn't have any new messages and all my old messages made me feel worse than not having any new ones. I shut my phone off around 8:30 pm so I wouldn't think about it. I got on my computer and cranked one out, to what I don't remember. I was in bed before 9 pm. I don't like remembering what I thought while laying there. I got up and took some medication to help me sleep. I was effectively dead to the world as far as anyone knew for the next 8 hours.

Tuesday 

I feel like a fool looking back on it now, but the day after I met him for the first time I had actually considered it a good day. 

Normally my day started with my neighbor peeling down the street on his bike at the crack of dawn, waking every dog on the block. That didn't happen, I actually almost slept in because it happened so frequently. Not that being late would've mattered in the slightest. I left my apartment and crossed the single road needed to get to the store. I opened the front door, flicked on the open sign, and proceeded with my work day.

My work day was completed at 7:25 am. Officially out of things to do sans customers, I sat at the front desk with my book and read.

12:00 pm rolled around, no sign of Dale of course. He didn't even bother to text that day… or at least that's what I thought until I noticed I forgot my phone at home. Having almost slept in threw me off my rhythm and I didn't pick it up.

 I debated whether or not I should close up shop for lunch and go get it when he walked in again.

“Hello Adam, glad to see you're still here. Man of your word!”

The old man looked at me like a proud fisherman looking at his catch. 

I jumped at his presence. I looked at the front door, wondering why the chime didn't go off. Ignoring my own question I greeted him. In the daylight the old man looked… fuller? Less wrinkled and a bit redder in the face. I remember questioning if he was taller as well…

“Oh man… you startled me! But uh… yeah I'm here like always.”

Small talk was never my strong suit. 

“Good good. So… how was your night?”

“Uh… it was fine. How was yours?”

I realized at that moment I did not know the man’s name, I really hoped it wouldn't come up.

The man looked at me like a dog that wouldn't stop barking.

“Adam… do you not know?”

“What do you mean? How would I… wait, do you mean your project? Were you working on that?”

The man smiled again, still not showing his teeth.

“Yes! What do you think so far?”

“Uhh… sir… I don't know what your project is. You left before you told me what it was yesterday. I can't weigh in on something I don't know about.”

The old man paused. He turned to look at the glass front doors of the shop. I followed his gaze. All I saw was an empty parking lot. He stared outside for several beats before turning back towards me. He giggled like he knew something I didn't. Which was true.

“Silly me… I guess I did rush out of here rather quickly didn't I? No fault of yours…”

I remember thinking the old man was really weird.

“Oh, no worries! So… what is the project?” I asked, trying to get the ball rolling on the conversation.

The man tilted his head slightly, his eyes looking through me. I recall how odd it was that he didn't blink the whole conversation.

“You'll know it when you see it.” 

And with that, he opened the front door and walked out of view into the parking lot. I stood up and tried opening up the door a few times to check if the chime still worked. It did. I wondered why it didn't go off when he walked in.

He was definitely taller, I chalked it up to his posture and forgot about it.

I sat at the register for another 30 minutes. Part of me was hoping to have some other human interaction that day, other than the old man. Hell, even Dale would have been a sight for sore eyes. No one came. It didn't bother me too bad at the time, I was used to feeling alone. At least I thought I was.

I locked up for lunch, walking to my apartment yet again. I recall how calm of a day it had been. I could actually hear birds chirping in the nearby trees, it was so quiet. Things likethat were usually drown out by traffic noises. I picked up my phone off my bedside table, no new messages. I pocketed it and went back to work.

The rest of the day was the same as the day before, no customers. I made a note to myself to recommend Beth actually try and advertise that this business exists next I saw her. I locked up at 7, home by 7:05, and went to bed after a few hours of reading.

Wednesday 

Almost slept in again. No motorcycle, no dogs barking. Even the birds were noticeably absent.

I went to work.

Neither Beth or Dale showed up to the Wednesday meeting. I sat there, by myself, for hours waiting for someone to show up. Dale not showing was to be expected, but Beth though? That was weird. I texted Beth 20 minutes after she was supposed to be there.

No response.

I texted her an hour after she was supposed to be there.

No response.

I texted both Dale and Beth several hours after they were supposed to be there.

No response.

I developed a stomach ache after my attempts at reaching out were met with no response. I hate that feeling. Always have, always will. I left my phone on the desk face down, having given up on reaching anybody. That's happened more times than I'd like to admit.

The hours passed, I wasn't even reading my book anymore. I found myself absentmindedly staring down at the front desk. I was so lost in thought I didn't register the sound of the glass door breaking. I was thinking about my family when I noticed the old man was now towering over me.

“JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!” 

The visual of a once diminutive old man now stretched into a splotchy, sinewy giant shocked me out of my chair and onto my ass on the floor. The once five foot senior citizen was now liable to bump his head on the ceiling if he stopped looming over me with his unblinking eyes. I could see more of his thin, discolored skin as his clothes now strained to be contained on his frame. Parts of his body looked swollen, like his body fat was squeezed into shape by someone packing a suitcase. The skin around his neck was taught, threatening to rip at the seams if he turned his head too quickly. He was smiling. I still didn't see his teeth.

He spoke to me like I didn't understand what language he spoke.

“Adam. Do you see it yet? What do you think? I'm making wonderful progress, don't you agree?”

I was at loss for words, it felt like an apex predator had cornered me and was about to pounce. I grabbed the folding chair I was sitting in and held it in front of me defensively. 

“WHAT THE… WHAT THE FUCK?!”

The old man looked at me like a stale piece of bread.

“Adam… come now you must know what’s going on at this point.”

His voice sounded like it was echoing through a long metal pipe, like the voice was coming from somewhere in his chest rather than out of his mouth. I was still in fight or flight mode, and my legs chose flight. I did my best to throw the chair at the looming figure and scrambled towards the fire exit. The chair clambered over the desk, not striking anything. The old man’s eyes followed me, but he didn’t move. I slammed through the crash bar of the fire exit and ran across the parking lot as fast as I could. I don’t remember if I was shouting for help or not, but I do remember the suffocating feeling of isolation as I came to a stop. I had left my phone back at the desk. I whipped my head around, looking for someone to call the police or at least to acknowledge what was happening. 

The fire alarm was still audible, I looked back and the old man was crouching through the fire exit, clearly in no rush. He looked at me like I was a disappointing child.

I ran again, naively thinking that I could get to safety. I ran up the road, in the hopes that I could flag someone down. The side street where I spent most of my life opened up onto the main road, North belt highway. A fast food ladened stroad that could be mistaken for 100 different midwestern cities. Cars littered the street, but with no passengers in sight. I slowed my escape, I saw car doors ripped off their handles, shattered glass crunching beneath my feet. I couldn’t tell if the distinct metallic stench of blood was because I was overexerting myself or if it was permeating the air. I didn’t see any bodies. 

I kept running until I hit the intersection of Frederick and North belt highway, a stone throws away from the offramp to highway 71. This was the most traffic prone intersection within city limits and I was standing on the road alone. I heard the rumble of an idling car that was backed into another car waiting at the light. I rushed over, the car was still running but there were no passengers. The drivers side windows looked like they were smashed in. Amongst the broken glass were seatbelts that looked like they had been stretched to the point of snapping. I backed away from the car and almost tripped over something. It was a childrens car seat, or what was left of one. I looked back at the backseat window of the car, sure enough the frame looked like something was pulled through at great force. I picked up the child seat… there were bite marks on the cushion.

“I don’t like the things that run away from me, Adam. That’s why they were first.”

The old man didn’t make noise as he moved. I dropped the seat and backed away, my heart pounding. I finally found my voice.

“What the FUCK is happening… Where is everyone?!”

The old man looked at me. It made me feel sick.

“My project, Adam. I’ll be done soon. It’ll take me several days but the hard part is over. Nothing left I need to chase.”

“WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! WHAT PROJECT?!”

The oldman looked at nothing.

“You’ll get to see it. The ending. It IS the most important part after all.”

It felt like I was trying to talk to a message carved into stone, unable to change anything that happened or was going to happen. I turned and ran again. I ran until I couldn’t anymore. The old man didn’t follow. I wouldn’t see him for another 2 days. 

I was alone. 

Thursday

 I walked home in the middle of the night. There was no moon or stars in the sky. In the past I would have blamed it on light pollution, but considering I was in a nightmare I couldn’t wake up from, I assumed the old man had eaten those as well. 

Half of the street lights weren’t getting power anymore, I assumed it wouldn’t be long before none of them did anymore. I wasn’t being chased, if the old man wanted me dead then I would be dead. I didn’t have anywhere to go, so I just went home. I walked down the empty streets in near pitch black. The feeling that there was nothing out there was at the forefront of my mind. I didn’t believe it , I wasn’t physically able to believe it. A thought that I would leave the city and go somewhere else to look for people crossed my mind. The familiar fear of being disappointed quashed that thought almost immediately. I continued home, stumbling in the dark.

I got home. I barricaded myself in my bathroom because it didn’t have any windows. I took my sleeping medication because I couldn’t sleep.  I dreamt about being around my family again.

I woke up several times. I took the medication several times. What felt like an entire day passed.

Friday

Hunger eventually forced me out of the self contained hole I was in.

My fridge had gone out. My water wasn’t running anymore. I ate preprocessed food that didn’t need to be cooked. I noticed that there was more light streaming in my living room window than normal. I thought having something to distract me was good for me, but it made things worse in the long run.

I open the shade to let the light in. There was too much light. There's a big tree right outside my front door that blocked out the sun constantly. At least there was. 

I walked out my front door and there was no tree… in fact… there weren’t any trees. There were no trees, no grass, no shrubbery, just ruptured and disturbed soil everywhere. Concrete sidewalks smashed to pieces, no sign of any weeds or even the stray leaf to be found. 

The lack of plant life made the landscape even drearier than it already was. The air was dry as a bone and stale smelling. I was tempted to lock myself back in my apartment and wait to die when I saw the old man again.

It wasn’t hard to see him, he was sitting next to the Lightning and Lights store. 

Or rather… he was straddling it. His huge, swollen frame dwarfed the building even when he wasn’t standing. His head was resting on the roof, staring directly at me. He looked like every part of his body had grown too large to move properly, the skin failing to stretch and torn, his bones buckling in on themselves from the immense weight.

He looked happy to see me.

The flight part of my mind had died days prior, the fight part knew it would be hopeless. My body decided the best course of action was to walk into the nearest storm drain and assume the fetal position. I grew up in a catholic household, I stopped going to my church when they told me I was no longer welcome. I started reciting prayer from memory as a means of soothing myself.

“Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us…”

The old man’s face hovered over me, looking at me like a child would look at an insect. His head was larger than a pickup truck and he still didn’t make noise when he moved.

“Who are you speaking to Adam? Did I miss someone? I must be getting complacent in my old age…”

His voice rattled the ground beneath me, my body felt like it was going to shatter like glass. All I could do was wrap my arms around my head and keep warbling out my prayers.

“Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come…”

I didn’t want to leave the church, my friends were there, what was left of my family was there. I wasn’t welcome after they found out about Stephen.

The old man craned his neck up at the sky, the skin of his neck having long since given way. I was able to see every bend of his vertebra as the back of his bald scalp rubbed between his shoulder blades. Despite its size, his head moved like a bird’s, near instantaneous pivoting until something caught his attention. His face dropped back down towards me, his nose inches away from compressing me into the dirt like a sunflower seed.

“You’re a good man Adam, keeping me honest about my work.”

I don’t know what happened next, it felt like the force of the old man moving upward caused a surge of air to lift me out of the storm drain. I don’t remember how long I was airborne. I just remember hitting the ground.

Saturday

I woke up with the rising sun. My left leg bending in the wrong direction at the knee. My head pounded, one of my eyes was swollen shut. I was confused as to why I wasn’t dead yet. I was in too much pain to move. I was left with my thoughts.

I thought about Stephan. He wasn’t like anyone I had ever met before. We were in college together. The only reason anybody lived in Saint Joseph Missouri was for the school. We made eachother happy. The first time I felt genuine happiness since my older brother died. He was there the last time I spoke to him in person. He was there when I found out he died. He stood up for me when I told my parents we were together. He was there when my community shunned me for being in love.
I wasn’t there when he died of Covid. 

Nobody responded when I needed them most. I was alone. I have been for a long time.

I blacked out from the pain, the sky turning odd colors as the ground shook.

Sunday

I started writing this today. My laptop still has a charge and it’s the only light source I have. I had nothing else to do other than to wait. 

I woke up in the ditch again, looking up at the sky. Something was wrong with the sun. I held my hand up to look at it through my good eye. It was… dimmer. Like there was something in the way. My mind snagged on a memory. The last one I had with my family before things went wrong. It forced me out of the ditch.

I used all 3 of my non broken limbs to crawl back into my house and back into my bedroom. I dragged one of my dresser drawers open and spilled the contents out onto the floor. Amid the accumulated junk was a cheap pair of paper glasses. Solar eclipse glasses.

August 21st, 2017. A full total eclipse occurred over the town of Saint joseph Missouri. My older brother John came to visit the day before, he and his wife Alexa brought their newborn daughter, Rose. My parents came down as well, they all stayed at my apartment for the night so they wouldn’t have to pay for a hotel or fight traffic the day of. That was the day I introduced everyone to Stephan. We weren’t dating yet, he was just my best friend as far as anyone was concerned. The day of the eclipse came, but thanks to the weather it seemed that no one was going to see the total eclipse this century. As we were just about to walk back inside, the clouds parted. For less than a minute, the eclipse was fully in view. Surrounded by the people I loved, experiencing something truly out of this world, It was the best day I can remember.

Alexa and Rose died in a car accident a week later. They were slammed into by a drunk driver while waiting at a stop light. John was devastated. He took his own life a month later.

I find it hard to blame my parents for what they said, we were all in mourning. They threw themselves back into church life. My Dad went back to being a preacher, devoted himself to the word every single day. I threw myself into my schoolwork, eventually finding solace in Stephan. 

When they found out, my father looked at me like I had murdered his only remaining son. He excommunicated me from my small town church. Everyone I had grown up with turned on me without a second thought. I stayed in Saint Joseph, even after I lost Stephan. I had nowhere else to go.

I crawled to my front door, laying on my back gasping from the pain in the same spot I saw the solar eclipse years ago. I put the glasses on and looked at the sun.
The old man looked back at me. His neck coiled and swayed behind the sun like a serpent around a heat lamp. His head was round and cratered with his bottom jaw visibly split open. I saw his teeth, thousands of pointed pillars that would dwarf mountains. His eyes were thousands of miles away and I could tell he still saw me. His lips drifted to a fro like foam on the waves… He was saying something.

I can’t be sure, from my perspective the sun was about the size of a button looking through my one good eye. There was no sound, just a slow, methodical mouthing of his intended message…

I. Found. God.

With his final edict having been communicated, his head split in twain. A blossom of white pillars for teeth stretched out over the sun and swallowed it whole. The light of the star shined dimly through the skin of the old man before slowly extinguishing. The world became dark.

I am in my room right now. It’s getting harder to type because of the cold. I don’t know if anyone will ever read this. I don’t know if there will be anyone ever again. I’m going to take the rest of my medication and get some sleep.

I love you Stephan.
