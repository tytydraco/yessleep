The artist had called it: ‘*The Unbearable Burden’.* It was an eight foot tall teddy bear, crudely stitched together from the bodies of countless other stuffed animals. The bear sat inside of a barbed wire cage, like some sort of dangerous prisoner on display. The artist had described it as a *‘tribute to the children whose lives were destroyed by parental abuse.’* He’d stitched it together from the toys of children who’d allegedly been victims of abuse. I guess he thought he was making some sort of deep, profound statement but really all he did was make a really fucking ugly bear, put it in a cage and tie some sob story to it. I guess it wasn’t the ugliest sculpture I’d ever seen them put up (if you could really even call it a sculpture) but it was up there, and I said as much to Elanor while we did our rounds.

&#x200B;

Elanor didn’t really reply to me when I said it. Her expression was as stony as hard to read as she looked at the sculpture, but that really wasn’t anything new. Elanor's expression was *always* stony and hard to read. That woman could win a fucking poker tournament while sitting from the sidelines. She looked like she’d never experienced a single orgasm in her life. Nothing seemed to phase her. It was both impressive and terrifying.

*“Guess art is subjective,”* She’d said with a shrug before turning away to continue on with her rounds. I just shook my head and went to follow her.

*“There’s subjective and then there’s just plain dumb,”* I said, although she didn’t reply to that.

&#x200B;

I won’t tell you the name of the art gallery I work in or where exactly I live for the sake of my own privacy, but I will tell you that the gallery is pretentious as fuck. Maybe I’m just not an art guy, but very little of what they have on display there is what I would classify as ‘*art*.’ ‘*Pretentious dogshit’* would probably be a more fitting description. Hell, they probably *would* display actual dog shit if someone convinced them that it made some kind of artistic statement.

&#x200B;

Anyway, my name is Wilhelm and if you haven’t figured it out yet, I work a security gig at an art gallery. This isn’t exactly my dream job, but it pays the bills, and trust me, I’ve got a *lot* of bills, especially since the divorce. My bitch of an ex wife thinks it’s her God given right to bleed my dry because the court let her have full custody of the kids and unfortunately, there’s nothing I can do about it. So while she spoils our kids rotten and does absolutely *nothing* to raise them properly, I get to foot the bill, live in a rented out basement, and subsist off of ramen and peanut butter sandwiches… but I digress.

&#x200B;

Most nights, I’m working with Elanor. We don’t necessarily have a *bad* working relationship, but I can’t say we’re friends either. We show up to work, we do our rounds and then we call it a night. It’s usually pretty quiet. We carry stun guns as a precaution, but we’ve never once had to use them. A few times we’ve had to call the police on some kids who thought they could hide out in the bathroom after closing time, but that’s really as exciting as my job gets. Or at least it used to be.

&#x200B;

The night that ‘*The Unbearable Burden*’ got set up was more or less ordinary. We did our rounds, we filed our reports and we went home.

&#x200B;

We passed by that ugly sculpture a couple of times. Each time, I couldn’t help but stare at it. The artist had left the eyes on each of the toys he’d stitched together, and all of them seemed to stare at me as I walked past. It made me uneasy. I couldn’t exactly say why. Maybe it was the realistic look of the eyes? Maybe it was the way they seemed to follow me? I wondered if that was the point? But why the hell would anyone make a sculpture that seems like it’s judging you? That didn’t make any sense to me.

&#x200B;

When we clocked out for the night, I was genuinely glad that I didn’t have to look at that thing anymore.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I can’t say I was in the best of moods when I came in for work again the next night.

&#x200B;

I’d had a visitation with the kids at the mall that day. I’m allowed one per week, although my ex insists it has to be someplace public. It’s just a glorified lunch and this one had gone completely to shit. My youngest, Simon had started acting out, screaming and crying because he didn’t want ice in his drink. The kid was causing a fucking scene in the middle of the food court and as usual, my ex wife wasn’t doing jack shit about it. She just talked to him calmly, saying dumb shit like:

&#x200B;

*“Well I’m sorry about the ice but there’s nothing you can do about it, so just drink it.”* As if there were any way she could reason with a three year old. You can’t sit a toddler down and have a rational fucking discussion with them. Kids need discipline. So I disciplined.

&#x200B;

I grabbed that little shit by the back of the shirt and I said to him:

*“If you want something to fucking scream about, I can give you something to scream about!”*

&#x200B;

I should’ve known that the ex wouldn’t take kindly to that. The moment I touched him, she was causing a scene herself, putting her hand on my wrist and demanding that I let the kid go, as if he wasn’t *my fucking kid!*

&#x200B;

Then she started tearing into me for threatening him! I told her the same thing I’d been telling her for years, that the kids needed fucking discipline! She responded by just packing them up and leaving all huffy.

&#x200B;

Dumb bitch…

&#x200B;

So naturally - I was in a shit mood when I came in for work. I didn’t take it out on anyone, I was civilized. But I probably wasn’t hiding it super well either. Elanor didn’t really comment on my mood as we did our rounds, but I’m sure she noticed it. She seemed to be keeping a little more of a distance from me than usual, although I really wasn’t going to complain about that.

&#x200B;

As we passed by the section of the gallery where The Unbearable Burden was, I caught myself staring at it again.

&#x200B;

Maybe it was just in my head, but it looked a little worse than it had before. The eyes seemed shinier as they followed me around the room. I’m not sure why my footsteps trailed off, but they did and I caught myself lingering a bit. Still staring at it. Elanor either hadn’t noticed I’d fallen behind or didn’t care. She’d moved on without me and had already gone into the next room, leaving me well enough alone with the sculpture.

&#x200B;

I approached the barbed wire cage it was held in, staring up at its main eyes, which seemed to be made of large black marbles that reflected the entire room, only adding to the *creepy* factor. I shook my head at the sculpture, then turned away. As I did, I heard a low rustle. Almost like fabric blowing in the wind.

&#x200B;

I paused, then looked back.

&#x200B;

The sculpture had moved.

&#x200B;

It had turned, shifting its head so that it was looking at me directly. I stared back at it, trying to figure out if this was just my imagination or something else entirely. It had to just be my imagination, right? No way the sculpture *actually* turned to look at me, right? But the sculpture *was* looking at me. It hadn’t been looking at me before, I was sure of that. It hadn’t been looking at me before.

&#x200B;

I stared back at it, feeling a growing unease in my stomach. I took a step back and as I did, I saw the sculpture moving behind the bars of the cage.

&#x200B;

I *saw* it.

&#x200B;

The head tilted to the side as it followed me. It didn’t make a sound. It just… stared. And I stared back.

&#x200B;

The sculpture leaned forward, reaching towards me. It tried to reach through the bars of its cage. Its countless eyes were all fixated on me, and all I could do was stare at it in disbelief. As it began to pull apart the bars of its cage, all I could do was stare.

&#x200B;

The sculpture loomed closer, reaching between the bars toward me. I could see its fingerless hand distorting. Stitching tore as several plush toys reached out to me.

&#x200B;

I should have run.

&#x200B;

But my feet were rooted to the ground in terror.

&#x200B;

I *couldn’t* run.

&#x200B;

There was a sudden *SNAP* noise beside me. Two wires connected to the hand of the giant bear, and its arm jerked back suddenly. Its glassy eyes remained fixated on me, betraying no expression at all.

&#x200B;

I felt a hand grab my arm and turned to see Elanor looking at me with intense eyes.

“MOVE!” She said.

I didn’t need to be told twice.

&#x200B;

She dropped her stun gun, leaving the barbs in the giant teddy bear while she and I ran from the room. I looked back, just long enough to see that the sculpture was still staring at me. I could see Elanor and I reflected in its dark glass eyes.

&#x200B;

It was watching us.

&#x200B;

And I knew it was angry.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

We called the police, but they didn’t believe us. Why the hell would they? Who in their right mind would believe that some giant teddy bear came to life and tried to attack me? If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t have believed it.

&#x200B;

Elanor hasn’t said much to me about what happened, but that’s just her way, I suppose. She did give me a look as we clocked out for the night. As usual, it was hard to read, but… well… I wouldn’t describe it as a look of concern. More like a look of judgment. It was the same look my ex wife used to give me, whenever I disciplined the kids. It made me uneasy.

&#x200B;

I didn’t go into work last night.

&#x200B;

I didn’t want to be around that thing again.

&#x200B;

But as I’m sitting here on the couch in my basement apartment, I can hear a rustling noise outside… and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being watched.

&#x200B;

I can’t help but wonder if maybe I deserve this.

&#x200B;

Sometimes, people need to be disciplined.
