So I have decided to write what happened here.

I was browsing various websites when I came across an ad for a website called lemon juice.

"A social website where you can chat anonymously with people or you can use your real identity" 


I was a bit bored so I clicked on the link,a second window popped up and a website which was predominantly white but lime green on the top appeared. 

On the left corner there was a logo of a lemon man squeezing lemon juice into a bottle with words coming out of the lemon alongside the juice. The lemon man had a wide smile and just below him there is a text that said "squeeze the conversations!" 

On the right I saw make your profile icon. I did and after that I stared at the website, I had to refresh the website for a couple of posts to appear, they were normal, on the right near my profile icon I saw a button that said "chat anonymously!"  I placed my left hand on my chin and clicked it. 

A window notification popped up that said "what will be your anonymous name?" 

I wrote redfower11 I then clicked confirm and on the bottom a message bar popped up for typing messages and a big text box for conversation was shown, on the left I saw two icons, the one on the bottom was mine and had a duck from the you got grapes video while the profile above mine had a Russian blue cat holding her face, her name was written as yellow lavender 22. 

I chatted with the person behind the account and I then added her on social media. 

After her I kept on having various conversations with different people, but I rarely ever added anyone on social media after her. 

After some creepy encounters I came across a user called "Johnny the video game maker" 

His profile picture was some man holding a camera in a similar pose to the joker from the killing joke comics. 

I saw "Johnny the video game maker is typing!..." above the panel for writing messages and when I saw his message I became worried. 

"Johnny the video game maker: hey jack! How are you? How was the break up with Sarah?" 

How did he know my name? I never used my email in the website, in fact I had used a newly made email for the website just in case there was spyware, I had done as many things as I could so I could protect my privacy. 

Another message appeared 

"Johnny the video game maker: this wasn't a lucky guess, you are wearing a red shirt" 

Johnny was correct I wore a red shirt! I quickly grabbed a tape and placed that on my camera on my computer. 

"Johnny the video game maker: i can still see you!" 


Sweat started to pour down, my heart beaten more and more faster. My hand started to shake.

"Redflower11:who are you? How do you know who I am? How can you see me?" 

I saw the icon notification for him typing popped up, the anticipation was stabbing me. 

"Johnny the video game maker: you can clearly see my name, Johnny the video game maker! I know. I can see you!" 

Johnny then sent a file which was named "CINEMA!  THE VIDEO GAME!"  

He then sent another message "Johnny the video game maker: play the game and you will know more!" 

I was deeply worried, but I wanted to know more, he knew so much about me yet I didn't know who he was. 

Maybe if I play just a little nothing bad will happen? 

I put the file in a anti virus scanner and thankfully there was no malware or spyware.

I downloaded the game on my computer, a icon appeared on my desktop that featured a dark theatre stage. The name on the icon was "CINEMA!" 

I moved my computer mouse onto the icon and double clicked it.

The game opened up and I saw the cinema entrance, the floor was a carpet with light brown and light white checkered boxes. 

On the walls there were posters for various movies and documentaries.

Infront of me a man wearing a blue uniform with a wide smile was standing behind the counter, his smile was clearly strained and he had pure white eyes. His nose was big and all around he was stocky, he has light brown hair. 

I moved my mouse so that the camera could see behind and I saw the cinema doors were locked, rain was pouring outside and the outside was so dark, yet I could make out a city. 


I moved the camera back to the man and I pressed the w key on my keyboard and the camera moved towards the man. When the camera moved close enough 3 dots appeared and a message popped up "press K to talk" 

I pressed the K on my keyboard to talk with him 

Another message popped up "The guard: what movie or documentary would you like to watch?" 

A animation of the man moving his mouth flashed. 

There was only one option "Sarah's affairs" 

I moved my computer mouse and clicked on it, I heard a machine rumble and the guard took out the ticket out of the machine and gave it to my camera 

"Enjoy the documentary!" He said. 

I moved my mouse towards the door which had a sign that said "THE MOVIES AND DOCUMENTARIES!" 

I pressed W key and when I was near the door I moved my mouse so that the camera showed the man again and I saw that he was fully facing me, every time I moved my character he would move his body to watch.

I then turned the camera towards the door and clicked the left button on my mouse and the door opened, when my character moved forward the door violently shut behind my character. 

I looked behind and saw the guard was still watching my character, I spun my mouse around and made my character go forward. 

The hallway to the documentary was dark, with no light to show the path,my character could only approximately see 5 feet infront of him. 

After 5 minutes of walking I saw a opened door and light coming out of the door, when my character moved into the room I saw that the room had a giant screen and many rows of red seats. I made my character sit in one of them and the movie started. 

The documentary showed me and Sarah kissing, then after that the camera followed Sarah walking to her home. On the road she met some guy, and the camera showed her walking behind some bushes and fucking him. 

This was a week after we became boyfriend and girlfriend, I was disgusted by this and I considered closing the game, then static appeared on the big screen and the screen showed another moment similar to the one before, me having sex with her then she telling me she loves me and then 5 minutes later she goes and fucks another guy.

I was furious,I thought she only cheated on me with only one guy. But she cheated on me throughout our entire relationship! The big screen showed many similar moments like this. 

I was way too furious so to calm down I opened the game menu and I saved the game and turned the game off. 

I then went on the website and saw multiple messages from Johnny 


"Johnny the video game maker:enjoying the documentary? I managed to film as much as I could but I am unsatisfied since the documentary didn't feature a murder, could you murder Sarah so that the documentary is more fun? I will even give you money and bribe the local cops so that you do not go to jail. I want to make a good video game" 

I then closed the website and opened reddit and started writing here.
