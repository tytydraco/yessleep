When I signed up to work at a government facility, I expected mysterious cases or high-crime pursuits. You know, the stuff you’d think of as a kid. Not this.

The tapping of my keyboard was the only noise that echoed throughout the large and bare four-walled room. I’m here once a week and there’s always a specific routine put in place. 

One hour prior to each one of my shifts, a black van pulls to my apartment. After I make it outside, I’ve been instructed not to leave my doorstep until the vehicle’s sliding door opens; that’s my cue to approach the man that’s supposed to step outside, the one always holding the long, black cloth. 

His job is to blindfold me and safely get me to my destination without allowing me to know where we’re going, which is why the first thirty minutes of the drive is a bundle of random turns that’s supposed to throw me off in case I ever decide to keep track of which directions take us to the facility. 

In actuality, the drive is only supposed to take around ten minutes, or so I’ve been told. My eyes are supposed to stay in the dark until we reach the room, *this* room. And somehow I end up in here with no sign of entry ways. No doors, no windows, nothing.

The only opening that’s in this room is a large metal pipe protruding from the ceiling; it’s how I get my food and water. Or—if I really need to—I can ask for a bucket…anyways, there’s been an intercom system installed so I can ask for these things. They usually don’t talk to me, but an alarm does go off at the end of each shift, kind of like a school bell.

*bzzz.*

I pick up my phone, it’s a text from Lucy.

I am absolutely going to tear up that chicken pasta bake tomorrow. 

Lucy has been one of my closest friends since I moved here for college two years ago, always so welcoming and inviting. Her mom is so nice too. I’ve met her a handful of times, but each interaction makes me miss *my* mom just a bit more. It’s not like my family is across the country or anything—it’s about a three-hour drive from here—but I still get homesick.

I set my laptop down and stand up, stretching my arms above me as I do so, then swing them back down to my sides. A sigh escapes me as I look down at my task for the day. The same task I’m assigned every time I come here: keep watch over that thing in the middle of the room. 

I don’t know what it is, of course. And they’re not going to trust a random college student to keep that information secret, so they nailed a tarp over the object. 

All I know is that it’s something square. I’m just thankful that I didn’t have any other knowledge about it though, because it’s the only reason I’m allowed to have access to my electronics here. I can’t tell anyone about what I’m protecting if I don’t know what it is, right?

My fingertips slide along the wall as I walk along the perimeter of the room. It’s five in the afternoon now, and I’ve finished all of what I needed to do today regarding my classes. 

I’m tired of watching movies and I’ve already lost fifteen online Connect Four games to Luc…she won’t let me play the word games with her…for obvious reasons. After some brainstorming, I figured I’d call my mom since I realized she’d be off work by now.

A few rings go by, *“Hey, Steph!”* 

I smile, “Hi, mom. How are you? How was work?” 

The sound of papers shuffle on the other end. *“Oh good! Work was good, I’m actually finishing up reviewing some applications from a couple of future clients. Your dad is out right now on a drive down to a restaurant for a last-minute meeting, so I’m happy that I don’t have to cook dinner tonight.”* She let out a laugh, allowing me to join in. 

“That sounds like fun. I thought dad wasn’t travelling for work for a while?” I looked around, spotting the metal pipe coming from the ceiling. 

*“Yeahhh, he’s not supposed to, but this meeting seemed pretty important based on how the phone call went. That’s what he told me.”*

“Oh, okay, gotcha. Well, tell him I said hi and that I love him when he comes home. I just realized hadn’t eaten lunch yet so a huge craving for tacos just came over me…I might have to let you go.” 

Laughter rang out of the phone once more, *“Okay! Well, go on and get your tacos. You’re working today, right? Have a good rest of your shift.”* 

I let out a small smile. “Yeah, it’s today. Thanks, mom. I love you.” My finger hovered over the red button on my screen. 

*“I love you too, honey.”* 

*Click*.

I wandered over to the wall opposite of the pipe, they allowed me to communicate through a landline placed under the intercom system. My hand reached out for the phone as I dialed the number written on the wall, I waited until I heard three beeps, then requested my delicious sounding tacos.

Did I mention I can request any food I want? Easiest and most rewarding job ever if you asked me. 

Around ten minutes went by before a box was slowly brought down by a rope through the pipe above. I went for it after it landed and opened it, I didn’t realize how hungry I was. As I started eating, I took note of the taste. It was authentic and fresh, and steamy as if they were just made. 

Then I took notice of the subtle hint of cardboard. 

My eyebrows furrow in confusion and concern as I grab a napkin from the box. I spit the last bite I took into the two-ply paper and brought it away from my face for inspection. 

That’s when I spotted the hard, brown material. I dug into the saliva-filled mash of food and picked out what I realized was a makeshift message,

“POP”

The corner of my mouth pulled to the side in a snark of confusion, “Huh?”

Music suddenly rang out from my phone’s speakers; my mom was calling. I picked up my phone with my left hand and answered it, still holding the note in between my finger and thumb on the right one.

All I could hear at first were sobs, followed my nonsensical words in between the hics and sniffles. 

“Mom? Mom?? What’s wrong, mom—please tell me what happened!” Sweat began to form on my forehead and my heart pounded fast in my chest, it was taking way too long for her to answer. 

*“Your dad, he…god—they haven’t told me much of anything yet, but he was in a serious car crash on the way to his meeting, they said his tire blew on the highway. Paramedics called me on his phone and informed me of the news—I’m driving to the hospital right now.”*

My heart sank.

“Are you serious?! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, god—why now—why now??” 

My mom cried out on the other end, *“Stephanie, please get here soon, I…by the little information I do know, I don’t think…god, we need to be hopeful. We NEED hope right now.”* 

Tears ran down my cheek as I ran for the landline, dropping the note in the process. I could make out the quiet pleas and prayers that my mother whispered out in between the static now forming. 

“Mom? Mom, I’ll be there soon, okay? I’ll be there soon.” 

Her words came out, fewer and fewer. *“Steph…can’t…goi…unnel…”* 

I put the phone up closer to my ear, only to be met with the loud and abrupt tone signaling that the call had failed

My hands could’ve been so much quicker when dialing the number on the wall again, but I was shaking so much. I listened and waited for the three beeps to come, hoping that I would be able to make them out through my heavy breathing.

*beep*.

*beep*.

…

…

I felt like I was waiting for an eternity. “Hello? Hello?? Please—you have to let me go early! My dad, he—” A dead, monotone buzz sounded through the speaker. 

They hung up on me. They. Hung up. On me. I dialed again.

*beep*.

…

…

The sound rang through again as if flies were swarming on the other end. I slammed the phone back on the hook. 

Not knowing what to do, I cried out. “Please! Anyone! Please, I need to get out of here! I have to go see my dad!! Please!” I begged and cried and in a desperate attempt, I ran over to where the pipe was and began shouting for help, cupping my hands toward the opening in hopes that I would be heard. “Please just let me out! It’s a family emergency! I have to go see him! He’s in the hospital!” 

I stopped to listen for sounds, anything at all.

At first, nothing. 

Then, slowly, very faint whispers. 

Almost as if they were discussing my behavior amongst themselves. 

Anger spiraled through my system. “Hello?? I can hear you guys up there! I’m not trying to get out of work or anything I just—I NEED TO LEAVE.” I put as much emphasis as I could on that last part, hoping it would inject some sort of sense into whoever was up there. I listened closely.

…

Faint whispers, eating at me.

I slid down the wall in sobs, “Are you fucking serious right now?…” This question was surrounding my thoughts, a question that was mainly meant for myself. 

How could they do this to me? My dad is most likely in critical condition right now and what—I’m just stuck here? Like some animal in a cage? 

I set my head down in between my knees and cried, frustration and guilt caved in. I had no control over this situation.

I should try to call my mom and explain the situation, maybe I could give her the facility’s contact information and she could let them know about it herself. A glimmer of hope sparked as I scrambled for my cell. I just have to call her—

…

No signal.

This didn’t make any sense. I’ve been working here for months now, and this has never happened before. I went for my laptop, maybe I could send her an email. 

The screen’s light flashed at me in a series of rainbow-colored stripes painted on a black background. 

My laptop was cracked beyond repair. 

“What??” I yelled as I slammed my laptop shut. 

How could it have been broken? I was just using it a few hours ago and no one else was in this room but me. Did I step on it by accident after I received the news? Nothing added up. I felt paranoid. 

I stood up and headed for the landline again but only made it so far before I tripped.

It was my assignment. That thing under the tarp. The thing keeping me from seeing my family. I was only here because of it. 

In just a split second, all of the blame fell onto whatever was under there. My emotions were practically numbed out in that moment as my legs took me to my bag on the ground. I shuffled the items inside in search for…found it. 

It was my pencil sharpener. I just needed to find a way to get the razor out. I picked at the screw, attempting to unscrew it without any tools. Tears filled my eyes once more out of frustration, and I slammed the sharpener onto the ground. I failed.

*ring, ring*.

I looked up.

*ring, ring*.

My eyes met the landline.

It was…ringing?

*ring, ring*.

Winkles appeared between my brows as confusion took over. I stood there for a moment, watching as the phone practically begged to be answered. Finally, I decided to slowly make my way toward it. 

The constant ringing filled my ears as I got closer, only for me to silence it after picking up the phone. “…hello?” My voice was hoarse now and complimented my red and puffy exterior. I had been crying for so long.

*beep*.

*beep*.

*beep*.

Silence filled my thoughts, I was baffled. My body grew tense as I looked toward the hidden object on the floor, then back up to the pipe. They aren’t going to listen to my pleas…so I’ll try something else. “Give me a knife.”

My eyes shot daggers at the object that instantly dropped down from the pipe across the room and my ears tuned into the growing whispers from above. I had no words. 

My hand let go of the phone, allowing it to drop and hang from the springy cord. I slowly made my way to the tactical knife laying on the ground. It was black and had a slight gleam to it. 

I picked it up and gripped it tight in my hand. Every sense of emotion flowed from my body to the knife, I couldn’t handle any of this right now, but I knew I was left with no other option.

 A few steps brought me to the centerpiece of the room, and I inspected the material, it shouldn’t be hard to get through at all. I brought the knife above me. Should I be doing this? If this is what they want, do they know what’s going to happen once I rip open its protection? 

These thoughts rattled me for just a second before I shook them away. There’s literally nothing else I can do right now; this needs to happen. So, I brought the knife down and sliced. I sliced every inch of that tarp—it was borderline therapeutic. That’s when I took a couple steps back from my progress, realizing what I revealed.

“...”

It was a window. 

Not installed or anything, just a window and frame. This? THIS is what they had me watching the entire time? THIS is what held me captive? 

I whispered to myself, my eyes were wide, “I don’t…I don’t understand…” 

I leaned down to get a closer look and slid my fingers along the wood. It was mahogany and was very neatly polished, but scuffed. The glass held intricate patterns and colors that blended quite nicely, and yet, stood out in the best way possible. Dust had accumulated on top of it as if it had not been touched in a long time. It was beautiful and all—don’t get me wrong—but if this is what I wasted my time here for…

As I began to travel through my thoughts, something caught my attention.

*tap*.

My eyes darted toward the glass.

*tap, tap, tap*.

I leaned in closer only to immediately pull myself away from the window, falling over in the process. 

The outline of a hand formed on the glass, even though the window had been clean just before. “…what…the hell…” I stared at the window as something else began to form. The glass appeared to slowly become hazy and far less translucent, followed by letters. I waited impatiently; my body was tense.

Then finally, a message appeared:

**U N L O C K**

**I T .**
