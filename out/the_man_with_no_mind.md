on Tuesday,i woke up with a smile on my face because today is the day i get interviewed for a job at a convenience store near the beautiful wilderness.Unfortunately the store is not in the city but outside the city in a rural town named vacuity.It’s will be a struggle to get there because i currently don’t have a vehicle but i will make it work somehow.

Leaving the house quickly i ventured to the bus stop and hopped on the bus towards vacuity.1 hour into my journey an unexpected headache occurred luckily i was 15 minutes away from vacuity.15 minutes in the headache worsened but fortunately i was in vacuity.

The place looked dull and advertisements filled the area with quotes such as “come work for me!” and “you should be here working” the residents looked like their facial expressions were taken away from them.Their eyes staring daggers at anyone with a gleeful smile and outgoing personality.10 minutes in and my head feels like it’s going to explode the pain is unbearable but i just have to hang in there as i am 5 minutes away from the store.

The deeper you go into the town the duller it gets and now the houses seem to be painted in a boring grey colour and not a sign of joy seems to be around.Finally i have made it to the store also the building looks to be an usual shape like something out of this world and my headache seemed to disappear when i entered the store.The manager said “are you here for the interview?” and i said “yes” unexpectedly he said “you can start working today” my lips pointed upwards and my eyes squinted “okay thank you” i replied.

I went behind the cashier and waited for customers to come but sadly no one came until an hour into my shift a man wearing a battered,grey hoodie and black,ruffled jeans also a no branded sneakers.He walked around at a snail pace which made me feel nervous.Suddenly he stopped right in-front of me and stared into my eyes with a nerve wracking grin.Something was off putting was it the way he walked at a snail pace or the wicked smile or the void less eyes or the way it looked semi-human.

Whatever the reason was it made me drenched in sweat and i was so afraid to look it in it’s eyes my eyelids started to close on it’s on.My hands  started to sweat uncontrollably and my lips trembled in fear.My knees felt weak and a spine-chilling tingle crawled up from my legs to my neck which made me twitch.

The man turned around and looked at the knives we had for sale which were hanged up on the mundane wall which was lacking a lot of excitement.The man examined the knives thoroughly for an extremely long period of time.When he was done he walked over to the back of the store.

He grabbed a pen out of his dull hoodie and started scribbling something on the floor but i couldn’t see what he was scribbling because of the countless boxes in-between my view of him but i could see his arm move around frantically and from the movement of his arm i could distinguish that he was drawing some symbols.

I yelled “what are you doing over there!” and the response he returned back was a low toned grunt.Angrily i hopped over the counter and went over to him and the thing i saw made me to afraid to move but he realised i saw him and he quickly ran away knocking over the canned food we had placed on the shelves.

One of the tomatoes canned food spilled onto the symbols and covered it in tomato sauce.When i calmed down i got a mop and started wiping away the mess and unfortunately the symbols wiped away as well before i could take pictures of it and send it to my new boss.
