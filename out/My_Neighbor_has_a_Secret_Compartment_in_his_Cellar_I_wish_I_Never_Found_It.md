Please help me, I have no idea what to do.

My neighbors, Edward and Emma, have been living as a couple next door to me for 5 years now. Over the years, we've become friends and I've integrated them into my regular group of friends.

They invited us all to dinner at their place tonight to celebrate Emma's promotion. I met up with everyone around 7 p.m. and we sat down in the living room for a few drinks before dinner. 

At some point we ran out of wine. Edward got up to fetch 2 more from his cellar.

“No darling please sit down. Marry could you take care of it?” Emma asked me.

“Why? Do I choose such bad wine?” he replied with a falsely indignant look.

Emma smiled at Edward, inclining her head as if to say “yes, my darling”. We all laughed and I stood up.

“Ha I should take advantage of having a friend who works in a high-end restaurant I suppose,” Edward told me, smiling with his large white teeth. He was a doctor and a very wealthy one, which was how he'd been able to afford his own wine cellar.

“Just show me the way,” I replied, returning his smile.

He accompanied me into the kitchen, which was two rooms away from the living room. We could barely hear the conversations from here. He told me to take two bottles of my choice and asked me to choose carefully so that the “duchess” would be satisfied.

I went down the wooden stairs, turned on the small bulb in the ceiling that projected a yellow light onto the brick walls, and started browsing his collection.

I don't know what happened. I was absent-minded, I wasn't looking where I was walking and I ended up tripping over an empty bottle that had been left on the floor.

I fell onto the brick wall to my left, and my elbow bumped hard against one of them before my shoulder and the rest of my body.

The brick, which should have shattered my bone, instead rotated on itself and my elbow went inside the wall. I recovered and saw that the brick wasn't sealed at the edges, which meant it could be removed.

I was about to replace it, planning to tell everyone the story on the way back up, when I saw something reflected in the light. I put my arm inside the hole to see what it could be. I pulled out several photos, old polaroids. Pictures of women in lingerie. Had I just tapped into Edward's secret stash of naughty photos? It was a bit weird, but Emma could be possessive.

On closer inspection, they all looked the same. And some of the girls had smiles that seemed... tense? And were those chains dangling from their feet?

Suddenly Edward called me up the stairs to ask if everything was okay.

I immediately replaced the photos and the brick, grabbed two random bottles of wine and headed back upstairs, giving Edward a forced smile. He looked at me with a neutral expression uncharacteristic of him and looked behind me down the stairs before joining me. 

Had he guessed I'd seen something I shouldn't have?

I spent the whole evening thinking about it. 

Because of this, I missed half the discussions, which Edward had obviously noticed. At one point he even asked me if I was all right, as if I'd eaten something not fresh.

What the hell were those pictures? I'd barely had time to see them, and the girls looked somewhat “normal” in them I guess? Or did they look a bit out of it in retrospect?

“Did you guys see this post on reddit?”

“Fuck Margaux please no, no more r/truecrime shit, not at dinner,” Evan said, waving his hands in front of him.

“Come on, it's about us. I mean this town at least. Did you know,” she started with an intense look in her eyes ”that every year for the last 5 years, a blonde woman has been found dead and that the date of the murder is always, always, August 25th.”

“You... you mean today?” Evan asked with a look that was part amusement and part concern.

“Yes. Today!” she said, widening her eyes ‘Isn't crazy, maybe somewhere in this town some poor girl is being killed right now...’ she said thoughtfully.

I was like a deer in headlights. I looked up to see Edward examining me, or was I dreaming? I was so conflicted, was this seriously a coincidence? Edward had moved here five years ago. And why would he have these weird pictures of girls hidden in his fucking basement.

But what if I was kidding myself? What if I was completely delusional? Would I turn one of my friends in to the cops and look like a fool by revealing his BDSM collection? They'd never want to talk to me again after that.

“Glad you're safe with us then?” said Edward, pointing at Margaux's blond hair.

“Yeah maybe I'll even sleep here tonight just in case!” she quipped.

During the whole meal I felt like a child who'd lost her mother. I kept glancing anxiously at Edward. And the more the evening went on, the more I saw him staring at me strangely. Was this just a reaction to the fact that he too must have seen me behaving strangely since I'd gone down into the cellar?

During the whole meal, I had so many glasses of wine that I staggered to the toilet several times. Edward offered to walk me to my front door at least 3 fucking times. Does he want to get rid of me before I talk to the police? Or is he just being friendly?

I've been in the bathroom writing this message for 10 minutes now and they all start calling me through the door asking if I'm okay.

I mean seriously I'm freaking out: is my neighbor a serial killer? What should I do guys?

Update: I made it home on my own. I'm staying on the sofa with the shutters down and the door closed with a knife in my hand. At least I'll be the only one who knows I'm crazy if nothing happens.

Update 2: It's morning. I've tried to call Margaux at least 5 times. She's not answering my texts either. I haven't heard from her. Her car is no longer in front of Edward and Emma's house.

Update 3: False alarm. Everything's fine guys, don't worry.
