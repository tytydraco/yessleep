A few months ago I rummaged through the internet looking for a room to rent. I came across a mansion on an intercostal across the street from the beach. It only cost six hundred dollars a month. I contacted the homeowner and scheduled a tour. 

The place stood two stories high with a vast patio on the second floor. I was greeted with a handshake by a gentleman who went by Anthony. He appeared to be in his early thirties and had long blonde hair. We went inside and he showed me around. We climbed a spiral staircase and he told me to get comfortable on the porch.  

“So what do you think?”

“I love it! This place is amazing.”

“Thanks. I inherited it from my mom.”

“May I ask something?”

“Sure.”

“Not complaining or anything. But why are you only charging six hundred?”

“I won’t rent this out to just anyone. I have a sixth sense. A gut feeling about people. If I don’t like them, which is most people, I turn them away.”

“I see.”

“I only want good people renting.”

“Well, you’ve got me sold.”

“I need first and last months. When are you moving in?”

“Does next week work?”

“Absolutely.” 

We shook hands and made our way downstairs. On the way out I noticed something strange. A skeletal goat head mounted to a door beside the kitchen. I ignored it and thought it was a peculiar decoration. 

I moved in a week later and Anthony showed me to my room. It was on the second floor and quite spacious. Each morning I arose in time to watch the sunrise on the beach. I would bring my fishing rod. Anthony informed me about the best fishing spots. He also granted me permission to use his kayaks. When I’d get home in the evening there would be a home cooked dinner waiting for me. We would conversate and laugh together. 

The second week he seemed a bit more distant. He spent time in the room with the mounted goat head. I never knew what he was up to. I never thought to ask. 

Strange folk clothed in black robes were coming over at night. Sometimes I would hear loud chanting and murmurs. Eventually I asked Anthony about his strange company. He told me that he and some friends were making a movie. He asked if I would watch it when it's done. I’ve never been a horror fan, but I agreed to watch it. 

One night I was preparing for bed and I heard the chants again. A bloodcurdling shriek erupted, splitting my eardrums. I remained frozen in bed. I was completely stuck and unsure of what to do next.

Whoever shrieked must be a top notch actor. It sounded like a woman meeting Jack the Ripper. I rested my head back onto the pillow. Again, a loud shriek pierced me. I wondered if I should make sure everything is okay. Or just stay put and go to sleep. 

I put on my slippers and decided to go investigate. Maybe I could get a sneak peak at their film. I tip toed down each carpeted step. In fear that something might be wrong. That it wasn’t part of the film. I just wasn’t sure, but curiosity hooked me.

As I approached the door, another shriek followed by chanting.I realized something was wrong. This wasn’t  part of the filmmaking process. No, someone was hurt or in danger. I slipped into the kitchen and dialed 9-1-1. I didn’t make the call right away. A small part of me wanted to be sure that I was right. 

The door opened slowly and out came a hooded figure. He removed his hood and it was Anthony. He was staring at me with widened eyes. A cracked smile that put dread into my soul. 

“You’re just in time.”

“I-I was just-”

“Staying. You were just staying.”

He snapped his fingers and signaled the hooded group. They scampered out in unison and grabbed my arms.They tried forcing me into the room. I resisted with all my might. While thumbing for the green button on my iphone. But it slipped through my fingers during the scuffle. 

“Stop! Let me go!”

“We’ve been expecting you. Don’t you realize you're about to die for something great?”

I managed to break free from one and socked the other in the mouth. His hood fell back, and his face resembled something inhuman. A bald man with broken teeth hissed at me. His cranium was outstretched and covered in ancient symbols. 

I ran outside and yanked at my car door, but it was locked. So I began pounding on the neighbor’s door. No one answered. 

A cold hand covered my face with a rag from behind. I fell asleep immediately.

I woke up tied to a chair, surrounded by hooded figures. I could barely make out their faces. The room was dark and only lit by a few burning candles. Anthony sat in front of me scrolling through my cell phone. 

“Let’s make a deal. Shall we?”

“You're insane.”

“Your ignorance is amusing.”

“Let me go! Please!”

“Hmmm. You could stay… Join us and…”

“And what?”

“We would need an offering. Call someone you aren’t close with. Bring them here.”

“Never.”

“It’s you or them. Good and evil don’t exist in this house. Survival is yours.”

I gave in.

There’s innocent blood on my hands now. I invited an old boss over for dinner. Only so he could meet an untimely demise. Consider this a confession of sorts. However, I’m planning something massive. A way to destroy them and achieve justice. For now I play the part they want of me. I mutter incantations when I’m supposed to, I fast when told, and I study demonology. They don’t let me leave the house and my room is guarded sometimes. But I’m working to gain their trust and respect. It’s part of my plan to escape and destroy them.

If you ever come across a deal that’s too good to be true. Run away and don’t look back.
