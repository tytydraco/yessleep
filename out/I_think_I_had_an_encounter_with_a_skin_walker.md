I was 15 at the time, me and my two friends were having a sleepover at my house. And at around 8pm we got hungry and decided to go to the shop to get ourselves some snacks. This was in winter so it was very dark outside for 8pm. Once we left the house we went around the back, through the field as it was better than walking down the Main Street.

After walking for about 5 minutes we came to a parting, you could either walk up the hill and go through the open field, or you could go through the dark trail that went through the trees. I suggested the trees, and my two friends refused, I don’t know why I was so persistent but I was doing it anyway. So they went up the field and I went through the trees alone. 

After about two minutes I heard noises behind me, I turned around and saw what looked exactly like my two friends. They weren’t close enough that I could see their faces, but I could see their body shape and hair. It was definitely them, I came to a stop and when I did they two stopped along with me. They wouldn’t move, I asked them why they were being weird but I didn’t get an answer. So I just kept walking, I figured they were just being dickheads and trying to scare me. But it started to get annoying, for me anyway. So I stopped again, and so did they. It was starting to freak me out at this point so I spoke louder this time, almost yelling. Asking why they were being so weird and creepy. 

I was two seconds away from walking towards them but before I did I heard my friends yelling from the other side of the woods, at the field. They were shouting, asking me why I was yelling. I looked over towards the sound of their voice, taking my eyes off the two people I thought were my friends. And when I looked back they were gone, which really freaked me out since I only looked away for two seconds. I went into fight or flight and started to run, not even going through the trail I just sprinted through the trees and up the hill. Eventually getting out and onto the field where I saw my friends in the distance.

Once I got to them I was out of breath, and I was surprised to see that they looked just as scared as I did. I asked them what happened and they said they were so confused because they swore I was following from behind them, but they heard me yell from a completely different position. I explained what I had just experienced and it was safe to say we were all shitting ourselves. 

We quickly started to walk away, trying to get back to the street where it was more open and safe. Getting to the top of the hill we saw the four pillars that had always been there, but once we got close enough we noticed a pile of small bones in the centre along with some blood. We all looked at each-other and said nothing, we just started walking faster. Once we got to the shop we still didn’t even talk about it. The only time we brought it up again was when we were back in my house. 

I'm not certain what happened was anything supernatural, I don’t know the full lore on skin-walkers. If anyone knows anything about them could you tell me anything about this experience?
