My grandfather was never the same after 1970.

Growing up, I never really knew what he *did* back then. The family story was vague. Something about "military aerospace engineering." He'd worked with NASA, sure, but any time I asked about Apollo or rockets, he'd deflect. The most I got was a firm hand on my shoulder and a quiet: *"Some things up there don't want to be known."*

That haunted me for years. Especially because at night, when he thought I was asleep, I’d hear him mumbling in his study. Repeating coordinates. Dates. Pleading with someone—or *something*—to stay away.

He’s 93 now. On hospice. And last night, he finally broke. Asked to speak with me alone. Told me to record his story, and share it only after he was gone. I didn’t want to wait. I need to get this out now.

He said it wasn’t Apollo 13 that launched in April of 1970.

That was the *official* mission. The one with the oxygen tank explosion and the harrowing return. But behind the curtain, there was another mission. Apollo 20**.**

NASA knew something was on the dark side of the moon. They’d been tracking unnatural EM signatures since Apollo 11. Signals pulsing in regular intervals—too organized to be natural, too irregular to be mechanical. Then, in late ’69, the signals started *responding*. Mimicking telemetry. Echoing astronaut heartbeats.

So they sent my grandpa.

He was a military test pilot, recruited for a “black” mission with two other men: Commander Elias Monroe and Specialist Calvin Trask. The launch wasn’t from Cape Canaveral. It was a secret base in Alaska. The rocket was stripped of all NASA insignias, black matte, unmarked.

They were told to land near the Malapert crater. The side **facing away** from Earth.

"At first," Grandpa said, "it was just… silence. That kind of silence that makes your ears ring. No dust kicked up when we landed. No craters that made sense. The terrain didn’t match our recon maps—it was almost like it had been rearranged.”

Then they saw the structure.

He described it as organic, like a termite mound made of obsidian. Twisting towers. Hollow holes that whistled when the wind blew—except there’s no wind on the moon. He said when you got close enough, you could feel a low vibration in your spine, like someone humming right into your bones.

Commander Monroe insisted on entering. Grandpa and Trask stayed back to monitor comms.

The feed went static the moment Monroe stepped inside. But not just *visual* static.

Screaming.

Raw, animal, like a pig being gutted through a broken radio. They tried to pull him back. His vitals flatlined within seconds.

Then came the knock.

*Clnk.*

One knock. Against the hull of the lander.

Not from the outside.

From inside the airlock.

Trask ran diagnostics, thought it was a pressure echo. Grandpa knew better. He said it sounded like a finger tapping—slow, deliberate.

Then the airlock opened itself. That's not supposed to be possible.

What stepped in wasn’t Monroe.

It *looked* like him. Kind of. But the eyes were wrong. Too dark. No sclera. Just two black pits like someone had burned holes in a photograph.

And it smiled.

“You heard us,” it said. “Now we’re listening.”

Grandpa screamed. Trask pulled a sidearm and fired. The bullets slowed, like they were moving through syrup. The thing laughed—a chorus of voices, male and female, young and old.

Trask collapsed, convulsing, eyes bleeding. He whispered one word over and over:

*"Backwards. Backwards. It's all running backwards."*

That’s when Grandpa ran. Into the structure. He figured whatever had taken Monroe wouldn't expect someone to run toward it.

He said the inside was worse.

Walls of moist, breathing stone. Faces embedded in the rock—some open-mouthed in agony, others in ecstasy. And sound. So much sound**.** Snippets of Earth transmissions, ghostly music, even a woman sobbing.

Then he found the pit.

An abyss that stretched endlessly downward, filled with… movement. Not shadows. Not mist. Just writhing that didn’t obey geometry. He leaned over the edge and saw—

Sorry. I had to stop writing. The lights flickered just now. My screen glitched. Probably just my eyes playing tricks.

Anyway.

He leaned over the pit, and it looked back.

That’s what he said. *“It looked back at me. Not with eyes, but with knowing.”* And in that moment, something entered his mind. It didn’t speak—it didn’t have to. He just knew:

“We were never supposed to leave Earth.”

“The moon is a lock. You cracked the seal.”

He woke up in the return module. Alone. No Monroe. No Trask. The structure was gone. The terrain was “correct” again. He swears someone—or something—put him back, like placing a toy where it belonged.

They told the world Apollo 13 failed. They never admitted to 20.

After the story, Grandpa grabbed my wrist, nails digging into my skin, and whispered:

“It remembers me.”

He died six hours later.

But here’s the part that’s *really* messing me up.

I checked his hospice room camera just now. The feed glitched at 3:13 a.m. Just static.

Then, for three frames, there’s an image of his room.

Only… he's not in the bed.

And the figure standing in the corner?

Its eyes are just… black holes.

Please, if you’re reading this—check the moon.
