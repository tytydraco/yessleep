 So this might sound strange. But let me explain. A year ago, out of spite and anger, I wished for the death of a higher positioned person in the leading political party in my country. He said some really ignorant and hateful stuff on Live TV and you know, sometimes you get mad and wish for someone to die, not really wanting it to happen or enticing it. But, a day later, he was found dead in his bedroom. It was big news for a few days, but after that not much more was said of it, so they laid it off as suicide.

Another time I was watching TV, and to my left is the living room window and through it you could see inside the neighbors' house. Sadly, my neighbors were a freshly wedded couple, all cuddly and cute. They didn't try to hide it, because everyday I saw them through my window. I lived alone with my mother and father, and had never dated or been close to anyone. So, out of spite and jealousy, I wished death upon them, again not meaning it literally. Just minutes later, blood splashed onto their window. I jumped at the place and called the police.

Police arrived and couldn’t really determine the cause of death. It seemed as if their heads had exploded or something with heavy blunt force had hit them, but there were no guns or other weapons that could explain the situation. After that, I didn’t ask for any more information. It was all too gruesome.

Then the third time, the time I understood my… Powers at the time I assume. I sat down on my couch, exhausted and worried. I had gotten fired from my job. And since I dropped out from school there weren’t many jobs that were willing to take me in. My parents didn’t take kindly to this. They were already disappointed in me for dropping out, but now losing maybe the only job willing to have me in the city. Oh god. I heard their footsteps as they came down the stairs, stomping loudly on the wood. I sighed and got ready for their ambush.

“You- you got fired!? How could you!”

“Dad I-”

“No buts, this was your only chance!”

“There must be other works out there. I promise I’ll find it.” My mom spoke up this time. Her voice was shaking.

“Y-you! We have been taking care of you despite your failures and disappointments. But this is it. After you find a new job, you are moving out. I can’t stand you. All you do is play those video games.” I clouded my hearing and ignored their words. I heard only echoes of what they were saying. My head pounded in pain. This wasn’t the first time they were complaining, they always did.

“I wish you were more like your sister!” My father sighed after saying it. He knew it would get to me.

I just became furious. They would always compare me to my older sister. It’s been like this from the beginning. She was the golden child; I was the black sheep. I couldn’t hold it in.

“Fuck you both. I wish you were dead. Never speak to me again and don’t mention my sister ever again in my presence, you hear me?!” I panted. I scratched the edge of my sofa with my fingernails and one single tear rolled down my cheek. My inner grudge, the anger which had been stored within me for years was finally let loose. I stood up and stormed out of the house without even catching a glance. They said nothing, probably even more disappointed now. I didn’t really plan on walking far, just walking around the neighborhood, hands deep down my pockets and my grumpy face watching my feet take one step at a time. I knew I’d calm down eventually but at that moment my head was full of just raw hatred and frustration.

After I’d say an hour, I decided to head back. With heavy feet, I stepped onto the porch and opened the door. The sun had set just a few moments earlier. So the house was dark. But it shouldn’t have been. Mother usually turned on a lot of lamps around the house at this time, not enjoying the dark at all. They were the kind of parents to turn on your lamp in the middle of your gaming secession, which at least I found annoying.

I peeked around every corner, afraid to speak up, still kind of embarrassed by how I acted before. But as I turned my head to face the living room, there they were. Their bodies were massacred, decapitated. Their bodies were destroyed to bits. Intestines displayed clearly on the floor. I could feel my food pumping up and I puked all over the floor. The stank hit me and I covered my nose with my arm and I could almost even feel it in my eyes as they began to water.

“What the fuck…” I looked up at the wall. Written in blood, it spelled out: *You’re Welcome*.

You might think my reaction wasn’t suited for the occasion. But I called the police straight after and cried for many hours. It was just the initial shock. I couldn’t believe what I saw. But within the mixture of all the guilt, sadness and questions, there was one thing that stuck out. The text on the wall. Did my parents try to say something to me? No, it all clicked then. All the deaths that had occurred around me. I had wished death upon all of them.

I had a gut feeling I was right, but I had to be sure. So I went out at night, a Friday night to be exact. I looked around town to find some thugs or shady looking people. So at least I could kill someone less important or worthy.

I found my targets and wished death upon them. After watching them from afar minutes later, it appeared. A black shadow emerged from the shadows and a tall beast, skinny, its skin reddish brown, the long, thin and sharp nails. Its gargantuan mouth compared to its face and its thousands of teeth.

The thugs who’d I wished death upon noticed the beast but seconds after the beast just sliced them into bits. I was afraid, no I was terrified as the beast glanced at me with its piercing glowing eyes before turning back into a black mist and disappearing. What kind of powers was this?

I only used the power one last time. It was a mistake. But the most painful and horrifying mistake I could’ve made. After all of this, I did little. I was too empty. My sister had called me thousands of times but I ignored it. I had no work, no real friends. I played game on my computer all day and all night. Just emotionless in front of the computer screen.

Then it happened. I was playing a multiplayer game and I screwed up a team fight and my team began telling me bad stuff, how bad I was, and so on, online stuff. And I said the words. I typed them into the chat.

“You know what we should all just fucking die. Fuck you. We deserve it.” It was just venting out my anger. And it took a few seconds before I realized what I’d done.

I threw away my headphones and stood up and sat on my bed. What else could I do? I’d seen the beast before there was nowhere to run. My body was physically shaking and my breaths were thin. My heartbeat exhilarated and I just waited. Maybe I deserved it. I’d done so much harm on everybody else, it was my time to go.

My closed door gently opened ajar and a black mist entered the room. I grabbed a hold of my bedsheets and was ready. The manifestation emerged from the mist. The same thing. But this time I saw it up close and thanks to the lit up computer screen there was some light provided as well. The vast spread of black thin hair all over its body, and the redness wasn’t its skin, it was covered in blood. The teeth in its mouth had many layers, a maelstrom of knives. Its eyes were beaming white and just stared into mine.

I couldn’t scream, nothing came out. I tried to, but I only stuttered. The beast took one step closer to me, its heavy step being the only sound except my breath. My breath got faster and faster as the beast's arm lifted into the air, ready to slash me in one go.

No, I wasn’t ready. This wasn’t my time to go! I covered my body with my arms and spoke out in a last and only attempt.

“No, I’m sorry I don’t want to die!” My eyes were closed, buried in my arm. Nothing happened. I wasn’t dead. If I was, death was painless. I opened one eye and glanced quickly at where the monster was standing. His arm was not in the air anymore. He had put it down, standing straight.

*“Thanks for your service."* The mist came back and the monster disappeared within. I know I didn’t deserve this. I deserved to die. But I’m nowhere, trying to do something with my life that got spared. I’m working again, catching up with my sister. Still living at my parents' house alone. Hopefully soon blooming with life as I got myself a partner.

But even a year later, I look back and think about how I achieved those powers. Then I found it. While trying to figure it out, I looked through my internet history for some reason, thinking the answer might be there. I’ve never cleared it my whole life. So I looked back at the date where it all started, and one day before the first death I saw the site. While clicking the link, I remember seeing it before. It had just been a random pop-up ad when streaming movies illegally.

The site was called *Death at your service*, and the only thing in the middle was a blinking green button surrounded by a black void that said, *Do you need help?* I must’ve accidentally clicked it while the pop up came. I’m still not sure if this site is the reason it began, but I didn’t dare to try. Be careful out there. There are still things in this world that are unexplainable, and might only cause chaos in your everyday life.
