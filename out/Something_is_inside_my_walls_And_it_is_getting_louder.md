I don’t really know why I’m posting this here, but with all your scary experiences, I figured maybe someone could help me.

  
I live in Switzerland, in a small apartment close to Zurich. A few weeks ago, I woke up in the middle of the night. I never do! I was very confused — I grabbed my phone, and it was 2 a.m.

  
That is *so* unlike me. But I thought maybe there was a noise? You know how sometimes you hear something and turn toward it, but don’t really register what it was? Happens to me sometimes, haha.

  
Anyway, I decided to just listen carefully. Maybe someone was breaking in, right? But it’s really safe here, usually.  
And then I heard it. For the very first time.

At first, it sounded like gas escaping somewhere — like a vent, I guess. But then it stopped. And now it sounded like it was sucking air in… like it was *inhaling.*  
Like the walls were breathing.

I thought maybe something was off with the heating. Maybe there was a leak? But that would mean it should be localized, right? Not moving?  
Because it was.

It’s since moved around the apartment. I heard it in the kitchen. Even on the balcony.  
I got quite scared. Maybe there’s a marten in the wall? You know, kind of like a weasel. They’re known for doing goofy stuff like that — similar to raccoons in that aspect.

So I called a plumber. He was an old, big man. But when I told him the address, he got quiet on the phone. He asked if I was sure that this was the right place and all. And that confused me! My landlord gave me his number — said he worked in the area all the time.

Anyway, he did come over, and he was very quiet. He didn’t look at the heating. He just walked into my bedroom and started feeling up and down the walls.  
I said, maybe there’s a marten in the walls? Those breathe, right? Haha.  
But he said that my heating is in the floor. And that the walls were solid. That nothing could be in there.

It had been quiet for two days up until then. But suddenly, it started breathing again.  
Louder now. Much louder.  
It came from the kitchen. I turned to the plumber to tell him — and his face was frozen. I’ve never seen someone so genuinely frightened.

“It’s back. It’s back. It’s back. We killed it. It’s back.”

I didn’t understand what he meant. Maybe I was right? They did find a marten here before and killed it? But that’s horrible. I wouldn’t want them to kill it. I don’t mind a little breathing.

He left right after, told me I needed to leave the apartment — today. That I shouldn’t spend another minute, much less a night, here. He wouldn’t elaborate. And I said okay but… where am I supposed to go?

So yeah. My landlord didn’t buy it. Said maybe the wrong plumber came over. Said it was impossible. He said *they killed it.*  
Maybe my landlord was a plumber here before too? From plumber to landlord — what a career, haha.

Anyway, I’m sitting in bed with my laptop right now and just remembered to ask you guys, because something changed.  
It isn’t breathing anymore.

It’s whispering.
