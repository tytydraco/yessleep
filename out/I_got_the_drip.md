  
On Sunday morning I noticed blood leaking from one of the corners in the ceiling of my living room.   
  
Well, I didn't realize that it was coming from the ceiling at first. I only noticed that there was something red on my forehead and in the first moment, I believed I'd hurt myself. But there was no opening and no pain so my second thought was that it was marmalade. And so naturally I smelled it and tasted it and realized it was blood, or something else that was red and iron-y. Though, probably blood.  
  
I also remembered I hadn't had marmalade in months.   
  
Well, it started off small enough to ignore but sooner than later blood was dripping from all sides of my walls, I even put up containers and slowly started filling them up.  
  
Now, of course, it would have been the first logical move to go and check out what was happening with my neighbor upstairs. To see if someone was hurt or anything like that. And whether the blood was coming from humans or animals.  
  
Although, I'd seen the neighbor before and he didn't seem like a monster. I doubt he was killing animals.  
  
So I decided to instead wait and collect. I bought a few fridges that would contain the blood so it wouldn't spoil too soon.   
  
Could I have called for help? Sure. But I prefer to do things on my own.   
  
I even carried up the fridges myself!  
  
I did knock on a few doors in the building to see if others noticed the same thing in their apartments but none of the neighbors opened their doors for me.  
  
So, I continued as before, simply collecting the blood.  
  
About a week later, I heard a loud banging on my door. I peeked through the spy and realized that it was my upstairs neighbor.   
  
I contemplated for a while whether I should open the door or not.  
  
To be completely honest, I was slightly embarrassed about the dozen fridges in my living room and I didn't want him to ask questions.  
  
Finally, however, I opened the door just a bit and was met with eyes of fury.   
  
"What the hell is wrong with you?" He shouted and I felt my cheeks turn red.  
  
"I have no idea what you're talking about," I said in my most casual-sounding voice.  
  
"Before I moved here, everyone told me that the guy on the third floor was insane and to watch out for him. So, for an entire week, I've been killing and draining the people in this house. I even cut holes in the ground so it would drip down to you faster. And you have shown absolutely no reaction? What is wrong with you?"  
  
I sighed in relief.  
  
"So the blood is not coming from animals?"  
  
"Jeez, no, I'm not a monster."  
  
I smiled. "Fantastic." Then I took a step back to show off my fridges.   
  
"Well, I noticed it became more and more the longer I ignored it, so I collected as much of it as I could. If I'd known you were doing this on purpose, I would have come up right away to ask you for some their organs. Do you know how cheap blood is? I can hardly pay off the fridges with the amount you gave me!"
