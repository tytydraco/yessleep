I work in a small operations facility for a data science company, just on the edge of Antarctica, with one simple task-- monitor the pressure of a small tank of an unknown substance.



It’s not that it’s actually unknown, by the way-- just me and my coworker don’t know. We’ve been out here for almost three years and no one has told us, and we’ve never asked-- mainly because up until recently, no one cared. Our job is essentially to e-mail a number to some scientist on the other side of the planet every hour of every day, 7 days a week. It’s a tasteless job with not a lot of substance of work, but it pays well. Not to mention living nearly isolated away from everyone is a nice change of pace from city living.



Recently, however, me and my coworker (who we’ll call Jason) have been experiencing some strange things near our outpost, despite not much supposed to be happening in this barren corner of the earth.



It started about two weeks ago. The pressure of the substance-- or the object inside, who knows-- was substantially higher on Monday than it was on Sunday. This alone was odd-- the object we were observing never changes pressures or places.



To describe it in more detail, the container of the substance is a small metal cylinder about 6 inches long and four inches wide. It sits in an isolated room with only a specialized (and incredibly slow) LiDar scanner to serve as visual input, out of fear that too much exposure to any kind of light-bearing cameras would somehow affect the substance. The room is consistently held at exactly zero degrees Celsius, or thirty-two point zero degrees Fahrenheit. The room never deviates from this temperature. The container sits in the center of the room, unmoving. It is never interacted with from either me or my coworker, or any inspectors that stop by, or any of the supply runners. It is entirely isolated in it’s exact state, 24-7-365.



So to walk in one morning and to see that the pressure has increased from the default 16 PSI that it’s been set at for three years, to a whopping 30 PSI, we were obviously a little spooked.



Right after we sent the email, we were notified of an approaching aircraft carrying a small inspection team. After they touched down, they walked in without knocking and immediately started to berate us with questions. Things like if we had seen the change happen, wether or not one of us forgot the protocol to maintaining it, etc. We told him we hadn’t seen anything nor changed our routines in ages, so they all backed off. They told us to activate the LiDar scanner overnight, and to have one of us stay awake to watch over it. This was normal-- we usually got asinine and paranoid scientists breathing down our necks to send them LiDar videos, and each time we did they would send back that they hadn’t seen anything out of the ordinary. My coworker decided it was my turn to have the overnight watch, so it was up to me to sit and watch possibly the most boring monitor to ever exist. At least, that’s what I thought I’d be doing.



Over the next few hours leading to around sundown, the pressure gradually began to drop, eventually resetting to 16 PSI like it had been before. After flipping on the heater and kicking back with my laptop and a bowl of popcorn around 22:00, I settled in for a movie marathon I had been waiting some time for, and quite possibly the most boring night of my life.



I was halfway into one of the movies I had planned out-- at around 01:20-- when I suddenly caught a glimpse of something move on the monitor. I paused the movie I was watching and looked over. I studied it for a few seconds, and after concluding it to probably be sleep deprivation, I brushed it off and went back to watching the movie.



Three minutes later, I saw it again.



Now I was pissed. I paused the movie once again and studied the monitors.



One minute passed.



Then two.



Then five.



I was about to give up when, right at the six minute mark-- 01:29:00-- the scanner began to show a shadow standing next to the object.



I couldn’t identify what it was at first-- if anything, I could have mistaken it for a fly on the scanner had the room not been impossibly cold-- but as the scanner moved across the room, it came more and more into view.



It was a large blob of shadow on the ground right next to the container, one that had somehow gotten into the chamber while no one was looking. It appeared to be the shadow of something vaguely human, but it was like the thing it was casting off of was invisible. As the shadow appeared, the pressure increased back to 30 PSI.



I froze. Nothing was supposed to make it into the chamber-- if someone had actually somehow gotten in, I was fired. But I was also confused; the chamber is locked six ways from Sunday, and none of the security locks have been broken-- a very loud alarm would be playing right now if that was the case-- so how could something be in there? The thought of something being able to get past our security without being detected sent a chill down my spine as the shadow slowly scanned out of existence a few moments later.



I quickly backed up the last fifteen minutes of footage to a file and shipped it off to my superiors. Nothing else happened for the rest of the night; though after that incident I had quite a bit of trouble focusing on the movie I had been watching.



At around 10:00, another inspection team dropped down onto the platform, this time with a pair of heavily armed guards. They came to me and checked on the object, still at 30 PSI from the night prior. After the usual interrogation, they informed me of a new protocol they were enforcing-- the two men they had brought with them were to stand guard outside of the chamber containing the object, every night, for the next two days. I didn’t argue against it.



Like before, the pressure dropped again to 16 PSI over the course of the day. My coworker took to the night watch the next night. According to him, he hadn’t seen anything happen, but he had also fallen asleep around 02:00, so I didn’t exactly believe him. Sure enough, looking at the footage, at approximately 02:58, just under an hour after my coworker had fallen asleep, the same shadow had appeared, slightly closer to the object. We had no idea what else to do but send the footage once again. As expected, another inspection team came down with even more guards to station-- a loop I was already growing fairly tired of.



So this next night I decided to make both me and my coworker stay up. One to watch the monitors, and one to loop around the chamber’s building with a flashlight. We were in polar night at this point. Polar night, for those unaware, is the 6 months of darkness Antarctica experiences because of how it’s angled towards the sun. This means that walking outside requires a light, which, as you can imagine, provides incredibly low visibility, especially with the crappy lights we had on the side of our helmets.



It happened around 04:00 or 05:00. I can’t even remember the specific time, nor do I care to check. My coworker was making a round around the chamber, when the shadow appeared in the room.



I snatched my radio. “Hey,” I said. “It’s in the chamber. You see anything? Over.”



“Nah,” he replied. “Not yet. Making my way around one more time, I’ll see if I can spot something.”



Then a minute passed.



Then two.



Then five.



Then seven.



Then I got fed up and radioed in. “Anything?”



No answer.



The chill from two nights ago ran down my spine again. “You see anything?”



*No answer.*



I started to panic. The shadow grew bigger on the screen, slowly starting to encapsulate the object in it’s cover, the caster still very much invisible in the chamber.



Eventually I got tired of waiting for the radio. I holstered it on my jacket, ran out into the hallway, locked the door, and stepped outside, the cold air snapping against my face. I pulled out a pair of binoculars I had brought out and peered toward the chamber’s location.



The guards were gone.



I’ve never sprinted faster in my life. The entire time I screamed over the radio. “Jason? Jason?!” And yet still received no response. A sense of dread washed over me as I turned onto the bridge connecting the main facility to the tower where the chamber resided.



As I turned the corner, I noticed the guards’ guns laid on the ground, like someone had forced their way inside and told the guards to drop their weapons. I picked one of them up as I approached the entrance.



It was wide open.



In fact, the door was laying on the ground, just inside.



I’d like to tell you one more thing about this chamber-- there is technically a way inside. It’s through a giant tungsten door blocking off the entire chamber. You needed some serious security clearance to get in-- damn near needed to own the company just to ask for permission to enter, and even then your chances were slim. Not to mention it’s built with at least a foot of metal between you and the object.



So when I say I saw this foot-thick metal door laying down on the ground just inside the chamber, I got seriously shaky.



I turned and peeked into where the chamber was.



Standing inside was a tall, slender figure, about 7 feet tall if I had to guess. It stood over the object, it’s hand outstretched toward it, almost as if it was attempting to pick it up. The figure turned to face my head poking out from around the corner and I saw it’s face. It was horrifyingly plain-- two beaded eyes on both sides of the face, and a closed, thin mouth resting at the bottom of it’s very clearly triangular head.



It stood, showing it’s true height, and walked towards me. I held my breath as it walked directly passed me, hopped the fence, and landed in the snow. I heard footsteps slowly trekking away in the snow.



I must have waited for an hour there before Jason finally emerged from around a corner, his dead radio in his hand, shouting that he’d been looking everywhere for me. Once he saw the mess he shut the fuck up.



It’s been about two weeks since that happened. The object in question has been relocated to god-knows-where, and has now been replaced with yet another small object of the exact same size, and shape. The chamber has been repaired and upgraded security-wise since then, even replacing that old shit LiDar scanner with a proper, newer one. One that might actually be able to capture things in a bit higher quality to appease the scientists.



After a short psychological evaluation, me and my coworker were deemed fit to continue working, as long as we both scheduled meetings with a psychologist every few weeks. Better than the alternative.



I’m still here for another few months before Polar Night ends-- then I get to go home. Nothing much else as crazy as that night has happened since-- but I swear, every few nights, I’ll be sitting in the security offices, and out of the corner of my eye catch a glimpse of that thing outside the chamber. Knocking on the door. Waiting. Patiently.
