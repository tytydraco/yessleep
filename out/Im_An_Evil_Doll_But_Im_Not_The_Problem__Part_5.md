
For anyone working yesterday

I just want to say, being undetectable is exactly as fun as you'd think it is. No, I didn't do anything pervy (not really equipped for that. On that note, got to find out I don't have a digestive system either. All that flesh felt a lot worse coming up than it did going down.) , and I've managed to avoid doing anything evil with it…but come on, it's a fun toy to play with no matter what. 

I'm upbeat because I'm nervous, currently we are hours away from go time,  and over prepared is not how I'd describe my merry group. 

I'm going to tell you how we got there, but first, as always let's see what folks have been saying. You guys have kept me alive this long, I can't turn my back on you now. 


To the guy who was smart enough to check his house for me, good on you buddy. This paranormal shit tends to like coincidence and connection. And hell yes  chuck me in a furnace if you find me. This isn't some 'release me from my torment' kind of thing either. I don't necessarily mind this. Even the parts where I'm making you folks question your support, sad to say, but I'm made to love violence. 

No, I just have grown to like you folks. And at the end of the day I'm a homemade weapon that isn't going to get any safer as time goes on. 

Getting Kaz and Leo together? Oh I'm on that. 

And there are other folks like me out there? I mean I've met entities , obviously , but I'm assuming not every one has its own scary story. Wonder what the common threads are? As I just said, this paranormal shit loves it's connections and serendipity.  

Now I took a lot of advice, and while honestly, I get the feeling having Kaz and Leo in the same room is a horrible idea, you guys seem to live and breathe this stuff almost as much as I do, so I trust you. 

I figured between the three of us we had enough amped up senses to hear the Coffin Crew coming (That sounds like a professional vaping team, I know. But I'm an evil doll not a marketing executive.) So I broached the topic of a meeting of the minds to Leo.  

He sat on the old leather couch in the living room, shaking his head before responding. 

"First, it would have been smart to tell me that before I got rid of those bodies. Second, it’s a horrible idea. You might be friends with that thing, but he skips lunch and suddenly I'm getting a look at my guts." Leo says. I notice he is sporting a new leg. It's quite a bit more… low tech than the first.

It's clearly a leg from one of the robbers, little too long, and haphazardly reinforced with a few screws and wires, but somehow it seems to function a bit. He catches me staring. 

"Necromancy is a neutral art. For example if your friend was a wight or something it'd be a 50/50 chance he is an asshole or a psychopath. And besides I know like 2 necromantic spells, it’s nothing . " he says a little defensively.
"A candyman though? Nope, not something that’s physically capable of playing well with humans. " he finishes. 

Now there was actually a long , involved conversation ( via my phone, on my end) in regards to relative morality, tactical risk, a balanced team, and a bunch of other dry , important topics. 

But for the sake of a little humor before things get morbid, pretend it was a star wipe into Kaz and Leo arguing. 

"You want to bring another malignant into this situation? Really? " Leo yells , sarcastically chuckling.

"Yes, actually, he owes me a favor and could level a city block if he really wanted to. " Kaz retorts. 

"That makes me feel the opposite of better. My issue isn't with lack of punch , it's with something that can 'level a city block' inserting itself into an already high  stakes situation. " Leo says , slowly , trying to remain calm. 

"Oh, and your alt-right , tinfoil hat wearing, lizard person fearing gun nut is a better option?" Kaz spits. 

"You don't know anything about him sugarnuts. He’s a Greysmith,  he's not some militia asshole, he makes the shit that let's people like me survive things like you. " Leo says in a condescending fashion.

"I know his type, got sick of supplying regular people with regular ways to kill each other, needed more of a thrill so he started using powers beyond his grasp to make worse things to sell to more unstable people. 

Let me guess, Alex Jones fan, ten guns in every room, gets paid in bit coin, "isn't racist" , am I close? I bet I'm close.

And that Greysmith name? Half of them aren’t even Greysmiths  and half of those who are,  are just genocidal twats . " Kaz's massive mouth extends into a shoulder to shoulder smirk. 

Leo takes a step forward, I stomp my feet on the ground to get their attention , hoping to stop this situation going tribal.  

"Maybe we don't even need back up, the chest could change things." I add, trying to defuse the situation. 

"For the love of …. Have you not seen the pattern ! Whoever made you skipped class half the time by the looks of it. That trunk, it's going to have some spooky semi functional garbage that’s going to make you look real edgy but not do jack shit." Leo waves his hand dismissively as he says this. 

"Yes, all problems just need a bigger gun with more blades welded to it right?" Kaz goes to say more and I stop him with a kick to the shin. 

He looks to me, face full of rage. 

"The adults are talking, just stay out of it you god damned PIPE BOMB!" Kaz screams and suddenly both him and Leo go silent. 

Leo breaks the silence first, giggling , then chuckling, then full on collapsing on the couch with fits of laughter. All the time Kaz is suddenly apologizing profusely. 

"Look at Mr. monster pride, Mr. 'we have just as valid of a  society' , dropping P-bombs like they are going out of style. " Leo cannot continue as he starts laughing again. 

"I'm sorry , I'm old, I'm frustrated,  I'm in over my head just as much as anyone else here. That's not who I am, we aren’t in the 1800s anymore , I know. I'm sorry. " Kaz won't meet my eyes. I'm not offended but at least this seems to be calming things down. 

"Oh my god, I can't stop laughing. Maybe you have a little human in you after all. Dice clay here, not giving a shit what people think. 

How about we try the trunk, at least that will take an option off the table. " Leo says , wiping tears from his eyes. 

Leo and Kaz brought the trunk down to the basement. And despite the fact that it fit in the microwave thing, turning it on did nothing more than give us all sudden suicidal thoughts. 

Kaz acquiesced and let Leo call his friend J.P . 

When this gentleman showed up, I thought maybe Kaz had precognition in his bag of tricks. 

He was in his mid 40s, wearing brown cargo pants and a 'deus vault' sleeveless shirt. He was bald, likely not by choice , with a muffin top and pair of Dr Marten boots. I didn't see a tinfoil hat , but the giant joint in his ear was a good substitute. And his thick leather bracelets screamed of compensation. 

"Holy fuck,  never thought I'd see one of you up close." J.P. says poking Kaz.  

"Could we move this along sir? " Kaz says holding back rage. 

J.P. puts down a large black suitcase ,opens it , and lights the joint. After this he takes an odd obsidian tool, reminiscent of an awl , in his free hand and starts prodding the lock. 

"Put that out, if this place smells like a stoners armpit it's going to give is away J.P. and you've already made it smell like an armpit." Leo chides his friend. 

" Half of this is an anti void herbal mixture, which cost ten times what the weed did. Personally I'd rather make sure we aren’t being watched, but that's just crazy old J.P. … who everyone seems to need. " J.P. blows the smoke directly at Leo.  

After a few hours and a lot of borderline not okay conversations about minorities , he manages to pop the trunk open. 

There were two black leather bags in the box. The first we open is exactly what Leo thought. A couple heavier blades, a steel top hat with a sharpened rim, and a bunch of other (regular) flea market crap.  

The second had a small sheet of paper taped to it.  The beautiful cursive writing read as follows. 

"M-fused alchemical homunculus proxy. Prototype 2. 

Dear Milford:

This isn't to be used unless the mission is in severe danger . It's untested, but should be more than enough to cut down a few armed humans between you and the kid. 

Love, Angela." 

The thing inside made me look downright comforting.  

It was four feet of black and white mange ridden fur. I recognised it immediately a 'Sammy the Skunk' brand doll. It was popular in the 90s, it's shtick was it used pre-recorded tapes to mimic talking. 

But this one, was not factory standard. 

All its joints were enforced with overlapping bone, it had long pointed teeth, obviously ripped from some predator, and behind the tail, where the tape deck should be were racks of multi colored fluids. The tail itself was studded with blades that were rivaled only by the conical claws on its hands and feet. 

Instinctively I found a deep red 'on' button, and as I pressed it I felt my mind thin and stretch, some vital part of me siphoned off. 

It was disorienting for a minute but I quickly adapted and found myself in control of the contraption. 

Most of its functions were done automatically,  all I had to do was will it a bit one way or the other. I wasn't a fighter ace, but after a couple hours I was confidant I could point it in the right direction and scream 'kill' with a degree of efficiency. 

We had a sparing match (J.P.S payment for opening the trunk was to watch.) Between me controlling the skunk and Kaz. 

I didn't win but it was a hard fought tie. Much more than I'd be capable of unaided. 

We brought the contents of the trunk up to the attic,  and as I shut down the skunk, my mind started going back to full speed. 

Kaz gave me his number for when it was go time, and promised to have his backup on speed dial. Additionally he promised Leo something to remedy his leg situation when he came by. 

Does anyone else feel things have been going uncharacteristically good for me so far? Don't worry, it changes. 

Leo and I repair the house to what we hope is an identical state. I spend my free time practising with the proxy, and trying out the little bobbles that came with it. 

But the one eyed wonder weasel and his 3 balls came back in the wee hours one morning. And they brought company. 

About 2 dozen 20 somethings all wearing identical sweatpants and yellow shirts. They’re hurt and arrive in 4 hearses driven by the Lovecraft lads ( I liked that one, how about you guys?) , all of them bleeding and missing pieces. They shuffle in a single file line into the basement. 

For a minute I wonder how the bishop has the balls to do this in the open, but then I see faint shimmering around the group. Context dictates to me no one that isn't supposed to see these guys is going to. 

I flick on my own invisibility and trust in it to let me follow directly behind them. I get a feeling that something very bad is going down, and want to be able to get Kaz involved as quickly as possible. 

The bishop and the malignant herd them into a room that has no business being as large as it is. From the ceiling are enough thin wires to wrap around the midsection of each human. They feed through rusted pullies and hooks to a handle made of several fused ribs. 

The evil pricks  tie the wires around the stomachs of the victims, one by one, chittering,  laughing, and taking the odd piece of flesh. Terrifying the sacrifices beyond reason. Some beg, some plead, some offer to serve. None are listened to. 

Lastly they drag Leo into the center of the room, directly in front of the bishop. 

"Didn't even have the guts to kill yourself eh? Well, you get to see , once again how you thinkin you are the man with the big balls gets people killed." The bishop says. 

He starts to chant, a breeze from nowhere starts to stir the room as the bishop begins to pull on the handle. The victims raise, wires digging , inch by inch into them. 

He starts to get louder, punctuating his incantation by roughly jerking the handle, adding a burst of volume and raining gore that sends an arctic blast through the room. 

As the victims reach the ceiling hoarfrost begins to cover every surface in the room, with a final massive tug he bisects the victims in unison. More gore than is possible rains down,  minutes of blood and bone storming in the room before leaving an eerie silence broken only by erratic drops. 

In the room stand 20 impish creatures. 3 feet of boils, pus, and more clawed appendages than any creature strictly needs. Their charcoal grey skin undulates with ropey muscle and their stench is sulfur and iron. 

" Two more things choir boy. " the bishop says " the first, is that was the last thing you'll ever see. " abruptly he rips the remaining eye from Leo's head and starts examining it. He squeezes a bit and suddenly a white hot flare of fire and arcing static shoots from the eye. 

"That would have been helpful wouldn't it? For the record, shot to the head with that ? You'd be walking out.

That second thing though, " the bishop lowers his voice , putting his face next to Leo's ear "You never bothered to check for security cameras, you oblivious fuckin child. I've been watching." 

I run, getting to the attic and dialing Kaz as soon as I can. 

And that’s where I am. 

I guess if this goes as bad as it’s looking, this will be the last you hear from me. But by all means, I'm in need of any advice you have left to give, and I'll be checking the comments till I have to man up. 

If this is goodbye though, watch out for the shit that goes bump in the night. It's smarter than you can imagine and scarier than you've read
