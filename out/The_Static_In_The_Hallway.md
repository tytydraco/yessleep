I grew up in a very scary home. Built in the 1850’s, southwest of Chicago. I was the youngest of four, and I wasn’t the only one that saw things, we all did.

Now that I think about it, we had a very tumultuous home life, and part of me thinks that played into the “activity” in our home.

Our father was a pilot who was never home and always flying to another country. Our mom was lonely and needed to find her own comfort. They weren’t a good couple, and their relationship was colder than the brutal winters in the Midwest.

It was February one winter when I was about six that I realized something was actually wrong with the house. I had seen and heard things, but I told myself it was just my imagination. For example, throughout my childhood I had felt what I can only describe as the feeling of fingers faintly tickling my stomach while I tried to sleep. I still sleep on my side by the way.

It was snowing and well below freezing, and my room was ice cold — bizarre, because the heat was blasting. We had old cast-iron grates on the floors where the heat would hiss as it blew through. I got out of bed with my woobie, and the second my feet hit the floor, I felt the cold rush through the room as if I’d stepped outside.

I hurried over to the grate and sat just to the left of it so I didn’t burn myself. I draped the blankets over it and me, cocooning myself in a heat tent. It was nice — so nice — that I fell asleep.

I woke up, and it was still dark outside. The heat had stopped blowing through the grate,  the hissing noise it made was calming. Without it, an eerie quiet persisted through the house.

It was in the moment of that stillness that I looked through my open bedroom door into the hallway and saw something that caught my eye.

The line where the wall and ceiling met was not straight. It was not even a line, it was squiggly, like a wave.

I rubbed my eyes, thinking there must have been something in them. Nope, the line still looked like a wave. I couldn’t quite comprehend what was happening. Had our wall always been like that?

I got up, walked out of my bedroom, and into the hallway to look at where the wall and ceiling met.

It was no longer wavy. It was now straight. There was nothing wrong with our wall.

Then I heard my name, “Evan,” called from down our long hallway. It was a woman’s voice, and she said my name in a sing-song quality.

And to describe this hallway accurately: It was the kind of hallway that makes you uneasy. It stretched from one end of the house to the other, past five doors and a back stairwell, ending at a window that looked over the backyard. Hearing my name called from that darkness made every hair on my body stand up.

I ran back to my room, hopped into bed, and pulled my blanket over my entire body, using it as armor between myself and everything outside of it.

I lay there, my blanket over my head, quietly scared. Even in a home with three older siblings and a mom, I felt very alone in that moment.

Then I suddenly became aware that someone was looking at me. I can’t describe it, other than I could feel a presence. Then I could hear it. A change in pitch is the best way to describe it. The way you can hear that faint frequency change when a TV turns on in another room.

I didn’t want to look, but I also knew I had to. I knew that if I stayed under the blanket, it wouldn’t go away.

So I did.

I lowered my blanket and stuck half my face out, just enough to see. I looked toward my doorway and saw… static.

Not a figure or a shadow. It was an amorphous mass of flickering static, trying to form an actual shape but never fully deciding to do so. It was translucent. I could see the hallway through it, but the space behind it rippled, like reality was being bent.

That’s when I realized this had been why the line where the wall and ceiling met had been wavy. I had been looking through this static just minutes ago.

The static brightened, its hue became slightly more pronounced.

I blinked, and it was gone.

I sat there for a few moments and then lay back down. I had just experienced the scariest, most intense moment of my young life, all by myself, and couldn’t share it with anyone.

Then without even the blink of an eye, the static was above me. Hovering in space.

I tried to scream, but my voice wouldn’t work. The fear was so overwhelming int that moment that I couldn’t even make a simple sound.

The next thing I remember is opening my eyes to morning light. I don’t know if I passed out or fell asleep, and I don’t remember what happened after the static appeared over me. I think I was just relieved the night was over.

The next night when I woke up again, but this time I was floating above my house. I could see the roof below me, our neighbors houses, our whole neighborhood. 

Then I dropped, plummeting toward my house in a free fall. I fell through the roof like I was a ghost and came to a halt at the ceiling of my bedroom.  I was floating in space, staring down at myself sleeping in bed, lying on my stomach. It felt like looking into a reversed mirror.

Then like a cord that had been holding me in space had been cut, I dropped from the ceiling and into my body.

I jolted awake, still on my stomach, the exact position I’d just seen myself in from above.

A few seconds after waking, a toy car rolled out from the closet across the room and came to a stop a few feet from my bed.

I stared into the dark closet that the car had just rolled out of, waiting to see the static again. Expecting to see something. 

But nothing came. 

I have a lot of stories about this house. Too many to write about at one time. The thing is, these experiences don’t just stop with the house. Our neighbors had issues too. The whole block did apparently. 

I don’t remember talking about these experiences much while they were happening. I think we were all afraid that if we said what they were out loud it would make them real or that they might get worse. 

Years later, I was in the car with my sister, Erin, who’s ten years older than me. We were just driving, nothing special, and for some reason the question slipped out before I could think about it.

“Erin… did you ever feel like someone was tickling you at night in the old house?”

Her head snapped toward me, and the color drained from her face. Her eyes widened with dread as she said, “I thought I was the only one that happened to.”

Neither of us were the only ones.

Not on that block.
