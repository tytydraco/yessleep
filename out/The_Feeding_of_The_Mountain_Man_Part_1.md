There is a phenomenon known as the uncanny valley. This is, of course, when you see something that looks almost human, but you can tell it isn't and it makes you scared. Something on a primal level in you is saying that it's bad news and you need to get out. Everyone knows this, but no one thinks about it. This means at some point in our evolution it was needed for us to be scared of things that looked human, but weren't. I know why.

To clarify these events happened years ago. There are 3 encounters with the first being unsettling, the second was horrifying, and the third is why I moved out of the Catskills and into the city. I might only share the first one since I don't want to destroy my credibility or relive it. Granted I am anonymous since I haven't shared this with anyone. After the third time I got in my car and crashed it right after so that I had a plausible excuse, but no one really believes me much about that. Anyway I'll just start.

This happened when I was 15. I grew up in the woods so camping is something I did normally. I was also in boy scouts at this time before I dropped out at 17. I remember I used to brag to all the other kids that I could set up my tent faster than them, but no one gave the slighted shit. I recall one time I was messing around with my friend James and we saw a deer maybe 50 feet down the campsite. We were just unloading so I was carrying over our axes. He dared me 10 bucks if I would try to get the deer with the axe. Before the words fully left his mouth I set off at full speed, running and screaming. Naturally I was nowhere close and the deer could have easily just turned around and rammed right into me. I never did get my 10 bucks by the way. Another time me and some friends were on top of a mountain, so naturally in my infinite wisdom I decided to see how close I could run to the edge of the peak without falling. It appeared too close since I stumbled and fell onto the next flat section that sort of poked out down at a 90 degree angle. Luckily my springy body wasn't really hurt, but I hope that paints a picture of me at that time. It's kind of funny how the stupid stunts I pulled like that weren't the notable ones, but one way more mild.

Me and my aunt, who lived even further north of me, decided for some bonding we'd go camping together during the summer. Despite popular belief it actually can get rather hot in New York in the summer, and especially for me who's a hot body I'd get uncomfortable. As a result of this along with my tent being very short, on a very hot night I may be found sticking my legs out of my tent in my sleeping bag when I was too hot. My aunt and Idecided to go to this spot that was kind of a campground, but the sites were very very far apart. In addition to this there was only one rest room that was a few hundred yards away, maybe 10-20. To pass the time that day we went hiking around one nearby path. It was nice since it was clear, no wind, no planes, just pure nature. We were probably out for 2 hours before my aunt had to relieve herself so we went back to camp so she could get to the rest rooms. She passed right through our campsite while I stayed back to wait for her return. I was just kicking rocks for a while before I decided I was hungry so I went to get food. Our snacks were in a bag in my aunt's tent, so I went in and found it mostly empty besides a few cans of beans. I figured it had just been a rat or something that had pulled them off somewhere. I couldn't remember if the tent was zipped or not when I went in. If a rat got in it must have been open, but I could have sworn I unzipped the flaps. Unless there was a hole in her tent. I checked around all the sides but couldn't find one. Yeah, the zipper must have been undone, that's the only logical way.

I told her about it when she returned and she looked puzzled but agreed with me before inspecting the tent and the surrounding area. I remember she looked at one spot on the ground and stared at it for a solid minute before saying, "So weird." I asked what she meant, but she quickly shot her head up like she forgot I was there and said it was nothing before sweeping her foot across the ground where she had been looking. I didn't care at the time because I was busy being so proud that I figured out it was a rat, but looking back I assume she erased something that was in the dirt. After that we made a fire and by we I mean I tried for a solid 10-20 minutes with a flint and steel before she just used a lighter to get it going. At probably 9:30ish we called it a night and put out the fire.

Like I said, it was hot out and my clothes still trapped heat from the fire so I decided I would let my legs rest in the cool air that night. Now, hindsight is 20/20 and you may think only an idiot would do that, but I'd like to reiterate I was very very comfortable in the woods and this is something I had done before with no issues. Still, it definitely wasn't bright. I was tired from the day so fell into slumber fairly quickly. I don't recall dreaming that night, I usually did but I felt like there was some block for that night.

I woke up. I tried to think of what woke me but nothing did. I figured some sound had tipped me off, probably just the wind. No, it couldn't have been, there had been no wind all day. Was there an animal? I listened closely for the sound of something, anything. Not one cricket, not one frog, nothing. That was until I heard the sound of stepping on leaves. I listened for a second and based on the pace I could tell it had two feet. Oh of course, it was my aunt. She probably just went into the brush to piss and... wait no. She can't do that, she's not a guy. The bath house is in the other direction too. I felt a pit in my stomach. I was deeply fearful at that moment. I tried to calm myself down. "Maybe she was just desperate" "Maybe she was doing something else", but what I really needed was to hear the sound of the footsteps walk over to her tent, get in, and zip it up. I listened to the footsteps grow closer and realized whoever it was is heavy. They came closer to our tent and I thought I heard them turn towards my aunt's tent, but no. Suddenly whoever it was turned towards mine. I was scared, until I remembered my legs and feet were exposed, then I was terrified. I heard their powerful steps walk up to the side of my tent. They stopped for just a second and I looked up at the tent wall. Their hands were pressing down on the tent making imprints. I could have pissed myself right there. Slowly I pulled my feet into my tent. I felt an all consuming need for this person not to know I knew of them. Their hands pressed deeper as I pulled my feet in closer until I was fully back in my tent.

Moments later their hands were taken off the tent. I felt relieved, like the weight of the world was off my shoulders for about three seconds before I realized just because they weren't doing anything didn't mean they weren't still there. I heard no footsteps leave my tent. The next thing I heard was them stepping to the front of my tent. I closed my eyes and shut them tight. I didn't want to see them. If I saw them that means they're real and God knows I don't want that. I heard their feet shift. I figured that meant they were squatting down. They could now see me. They were watching me. In my own tent they were watching me. My senses were heightened so I could hear every move they made. I heard their arm push against the air as they slowly moved it into my tent. A feeling shot through me. I felt them. They were grabbing my foot. I didn't make sound but I felt tears well up in my eyes. I wanted to scream and run, but couldn't. I wished that the Earth would just swallow me. Suddenly I felt them let go and began to stand up and walk away. Back into the woods where they came. It didn't feel real. If you ever passed out it feels like the time when you just have lost control and. you perceive everything around you. but it feels much more dreamy than reality. I began to question if it was even real. It could have just been a nightmare. Actually it might have been sleep paralysis, I've heard about that. I tried to convince myself it didn't actually happen.

I zipped up my tent after what felt like an eternity. I curled into a ball and stared into nothingness. After what must have been hours I saw light begin to peak through my tent. I heard my aunt's tent unzip and I rushed out of my tent. She looked at me with a smile and said jokingly, "You must have had a lot to drink huh. You should tone it down or you'll turn into a fish." I responded extremely confused and still shaken, "What do you mean?" She stated back, "Well I heard you walking around during the night, I figured you went to relieve yourself. I must have heard footsteps go back and forth from your tent three times during the night." I looked at her and my expression must have spoken volumes. Her face dimmed, "You didn't get up? Well I'm sure it was just a raccoon or something. You know what, it probably wasn't even anything. How about this, you go wait in the car and I'll pack everything up." I agreed to this and sat in the passenger seat blankly staring. I could see her thinking hardly and pacing a bit periodically between taking down supplies. She would keep going back to a point and staring down. Eventually she finished and went back to that spot a final time and began to brush the dirt in multiple spots going away from where my tent used to be. I sat up and looked at whatever the last one of whatever she was getting rid of before they reached the tree line. It was a footprint.
