I was going to be late. I was on the verge of panic, uncertain of where I’d come from or why I was late, but I was going to be late.  
  
Today was supposed to be different. I was sure of it. The start of something new. My only opportunity to move out of my little dead-end corner of Appalachia rested on me arriving for the night shift on time.  
  
I sped over the rolling road in a panic. Dense old growth rushed past in a blur periodically broken by small plots of pasture, apple orchards and fields that a few months earlier were brimming with corn. Shadows danced out there in the dim moonlight and the closer I got to the airfield the more separated from the small outlying town I felt.  
  
My steering wheel was cold and it vibrated wildly in rhythm with my heart. I tapped it impatiently.  
  
The rusted hulk nearly left the road each time I crested a hillock. My suspension groaned under the salt spurred corrosion and strain.  
  
I can get a new car if this all works out.  
  
I nearly missed my turn. Fishtailing, I plodded off the main road onto an aptly named “Airport Drive”.  
  
I came to a halt at the designated stall and turned the car off.  
  
A minute to spare.  
  
I looked out into the darkness beyond the parking area and a tingle ran down my spine. The shadows that were once dancing as I passed were still now and the air oppressive. My hands were tingled with cold yet brimmed with sweat. Before opening the door, I took a few deep breaths, flattened my hair, and made sure my uniform was sharp. Looking into my image in the rearview mirror I cleared my throat.  
  
“Alright buddy. You’ve been drifting from service job to service job in this dying county for half a decade. Somethings got to change. \*You’ve\* got to change. You’ve got a daughter now, you can’t be out there chasing bar weasels and getting drunk every other night. It’s time to up your game. You aren’t the little boy who had to stand in the corner with his nose to the wall every time you messed up anymore. Now your choices matter for her life too. The pay and experience here are going to help springboard you off into something bigger and brighter. You can do this.”  
  
My car door shrieked open causing the chirping and croaks in the forest around the airfield to briefly fall silent. The crunch of gravel followed me across the unpaved, unmarked parking spaces poorly illuminated by one lonely floodlight. I made my way to the entrance of the terminal and pulled open the door to the chime of an old brass bell.  
  
“Oh, hey buddy.” He glanced at the clock. “You’re early.” Stepping into the room I saw Gus casually looking up from his crossword, bifocals resting on his fat, bright red nose.  
  
“Yessir. I figured maybe if things weren’t too busy we could get started early. I’ve heard night shift can be a lot to take in.”  
  
His brows furrowed and his mouth hung half open.  
  
“Well….alright, I guess. But we’ll be easing you in. Just the basics for the first week.” He held up a finger, “Will and I are gonna rotate each night, until we know you’ve got the hang of it, then we’ll start giving you more responsibilities – if you’re up to it.”  
  
We spent several hours on the night shift responsibilities for the airfield. Many of the duties weren’t too complicated. When we went to the control room at the base of the single tower overlooking the tarmac we flipped several very clearly marked switches turning the runway lights on and off. Then we walked over the several generators tucked away behind baggage claim to check their fuel and oil levels.  
  
“Checking these emergency generators things each night seems a bit overkill, no?” I asked.  
  
Gus smiled. “These aren’t for emergencies. This is our power. Yea, this past winter much to our surprise we found that some of the power poles came down. Some heavy rainfall right before the first snow turned the ground to soup and the just sort of…fell over.”  
  
“They really shouldn’t do that.”  
  
Gus shrugged. “Yea well, corners get cut all over the place. Damn things still aren’t back up, so here we are.”  
  
As we walked back over to the portables for baggage claim and arrivals/departures. Another tingle ran down my spine. Instinctively I looked around and caught sight of something out in the dark. It was the feeling of being watched. I tried to focus my eyes on the darkness. I saw some gently pulsating shadows near the trees but nothing more.  
  
The chirping and croaks were nowhere to be heard and I shivered.  
  
“Come on kid, I ain’t got all night.”  
  
I came to and trotted over to where Gus had stopped. “Sorry, I thought I saw…something.”  
  
We continued onward, restocking the restrooms, went over baggage tagging and safe lifting procedures and the other mundane parts of preparing for the night’s departures and arrivals.  
  
Finally, we wrapped up my first training session with perimeter checks.  
  
Gus’ labored breathing alternated with his footfalls on the blacktop as we walked down the small runway.  
  
“Every 3 hours you are going to be making this walk.” He gestured around. “You start over at the ATC tower and head out to the tree line, then follow that parallel to the tarmac until you pass the last of the landing lights and keep going until you hit the transmission shack. Don’t get distracted and go off following the transmission lines. Had a guy do that a year or two ago and it took us a week only to find his ass mumbling by the side of the road talking about the linemen – boy wasn’t right after that.”  
  
He paused thoughtfully for a moment.  
  
“Anywho, after the transmission shack you hook right following the shore of the river until you hit Eddie’s orchard then head back. You’ll pass his cornfield and follow that until you see the two terminal portables, then you check the parking lot and come back to the office to enter it all in the logbook. Just need to make sure there ain’t nothing out there that shouldn’t be.”  
  
We continued walking in silence for a few minutes. “So what do I do if I find something? Are we looking for the Wilson boys or something? I thought they stopped causing trouble after you…”  
  
“Well, you need to enter it in the logbook for one.”  
  
“Bears? What do I do if it’s bears?”  
  
He stopped. “Bears? What the hell are you rambling about? We don’t get bears this time of year. Oh, and be sure to bring your bear spray.”  
  
“Even though there aren’t bears?”  
  
“It’s under the counter next to the logbook.” He paused again. “If you see any wildlife, just take the truck out there and honk at it to get it away from the runway. Be sure to use your high beams, too. Very important. You see any people you get back to the office and call the Sheriff – don’t need to be a hero. You hear anything weird out there in the dark you leave it be, if it’s off property it’s not our problem.”  
  
“Any questions?” he asked as we got back to the office.  
  
A few.  
  
“No, I’m good.”  
  
“Great, Will’s in the control tower if anything comes up. No flights scheduled for tonight so it should be awfully quiet. Here’s the keys to the castle. Adios.”  
  
He placed a massive key ring into my hand that had more keys than there were doors on the property and took off.  
  
I sat down behind the counter, looked at the broken clock and sighed.  
  
I was able to knock out the task list before midnight and had 6 more hours to kill before the end of my shift. There was no cell service, because of course not. I tried reading an old Town and Country magazine I found stashed under the desk and found most of the pages had been covered in circles and doodles by someone who must have been just as bored as I was on some unknown shift prior.  
  
I decided to sweep up and clean the counters to keep myself busy and after I was done it was only 12:15.  
  
I groaned.  
  
The silence was oppressive. Outside the window was an empty, dark expanse with a slowly strobing series of red lights marking the flight line. I felt safer indoors but even then as I stared into the dark something felt off. If I turned my gaze from the windows I could see something out of the corner of my eyes. Branches swaying in the breeze.  
  
There was no wind here.  
  
12:34.  
  
I pulled the logbook out from its shelf and placed it on the counter entering my start time, grabbed my flashlight and headed out into the frigid night.  
  
The occasional whistling of the wind punctuated my footfalls. I passed red light posts every few yards on a never-ending runway. I kept walking for what felt like half an hour, losing count of the lights I’d passed. I turned back out of curiosity and still saw the slowly receding light of the air traffic control tower confirming that yes, all was well. After the runway ended I continued into the dark until coming to the boarded up transmission shack and the power lines that ran off into the forest.  
  
I came the edge of the marsh and began following it. Minutes passed. I turned to get my bearings on the tower and found it’s lonely beacon, but I also noticed a void in the dark – not a blackness per-se, black is a color. No, it was a complete lack of color, a hole in existence out past the power lines. It was getting larger.  
  
I picked up my pace.  
  
I got to the orchard and looked back finding that the lights were out. All of them were out. And that thing in the forest was growing near.  
  
I stood there and watched it for several minutes waiting for it to move. It didn’t.  
  
I turned back now walking as fast as I could. After a dozen yards I stopped and turned around.  
  
It was closer, I was sure of it. Much closer.  
  
I turned and began to jog forgetting everything Gus had told me. It was gaining on me.  
  
Now I was in a full-blown run down the flight line, glancing back every few moments, still unable to see it but sure it was there. The thing that had been watching me since I got here. The thing that drove a cold shock down my spine. This was it.  
  
My legs pumped like pistons and the sting of cold air shot through my chest with each strained, gasping breath.  
  
I passed the recently harvested cornfield, in which stood two perfectly still Deer judging me for my frantic escape.  
  
It was gaining on me.  
  
Finally I came to the portables. I slammed into the nearest door but it stood firm. I slammed my shoulder into it three more times and it didn’t budge. I remembered my key chain.  
  
I pulled it out and started flipping through the keys. \*too many keys\*.  
  
First key. No.  
  
Second key. No.  
  
Third key. No.  
  
The fourth key worked, the tumbler clicked and I was in. Slamming the door back in place, I frantically locked it.  
  
My hands were shaking and even though I was panting, I went to the window. The void cast long shadows across the field as it stood transfixed not on me, but on the deer.  
  
“Shhhh” a man’s voice whispered from behind me.  
  
“Oh SWEET JESUS FU-“ I screamed as a hand clamped down on my mouth.  
  
“SHHH.” Sharper this time, commanding. “It’s me.” Will whispered, releasing his hand from my mouth.  
  
“What..” I replied quietly as I turned to see him using his phone to maneuver the drone. “What’s going on? You scared the shit out of me. Nice to meet you by the way I’m..”  
  
He smiled, “You gotta be more careful buddy, Didn’t Gus tell you not to go out into the woods?” Now that I could hear him clearly, his odd vowel pronunciation took me off guard. He’d fit right in, in Venice beach. Surfers. He sounded exactly like how I imagined California Surfers sounded. Very out of place for this part of the country. I shook the thought from my mind.  
  
“I didn’t, I..”  
  
He shushed me and pointed to the deer.  
  
“Just…watch.”  
  
I’d never seen deer stay still so long.  
  
I strained my eyes to see. The shadows, tilled earth and wilted corn husks broke up the terrain making it hard to see what was hidden in plain sight. I’d see movement then have to dismiss it as wind kicking up gentle curtains of soil or the shifting of a shadow from the small movements in the night.  
  
Slowly a thin sharp shadow moved, followed by another, then another. They moved in concert from that enormous void that had followed me.  
  
The deer stood transfixed before it all happened at once.  
  
A mixture of humanlike screams erupted as each of their bodies were slammed into the ground. Viscera painted the wind. In another moment the light went out and I heard Will sigh.  
  
The wind whistled and died, but we could still hear it out there breathing heavily as it gorged itself. From where I stood I could only see a throbbing silhouette breaking the horizon as it went to work. A crisp snap rang out as it pulled limb by limb from the carcass. The throbbing of the shape slowed as a new sound arose. A contented hum made its presence felt through the rattling of the windows and doors and threatened to overwhelm my own beating heart.  
  
The sound rose as the shape slowly moved closer.  
  
“What do we..”  
  
Will shushed me.  
  
I jumped and stifled a scream as a wet, boneless appendage slammed against the window curiously. The doorknob rattled though this time not from the creatures’ purr but from it’s clumsy efforts to open the door and join us inside.  
  
The ceiling creaked above us under a massive weight.  
  
It groaned as if remembering something and suddenly began moving away back towards the trees. There were no footfalls, just the gently receding sound of a blissful purr.  
  
When it finally entered the world beyond its movements melted into those of the swaying branches becoming indiscernible. The more I tried to focus on it the harder it was to recall its form or the impossibility I’d just witnessed.  
  
Will smiled and patted me on the shoulder sadly, “Welcome to *Murkintok*.”
