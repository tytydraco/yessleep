*dear diary, i am very happy to celebrate new year with my uncle leo, i love him a lot, he's cool, muscular, strong and very nice man, he always make me laugh and protect me from scolding of dad. he said he was very popular in his school, i too wanna become strong and popular like him. he told us that he will be moving into our city, i can't believe now i will see him more often now yay.*

I read that aloud, and takes a gulp when i turn the page, my hands shaking, i don't want to read more, remembering i wrote nonsense when i was child, i shouldn't have wrote that...i regret it, i never wanted him to find this, never please.

*dear diary, uncle leo came home today, we both had a good time playing, he gave me a piggyback ride, he knows a lot of cool stuffs like new games, and taught me to play that. he allowed me to watch my fav cartoon for late night. my dad doesn't knows that much. he's always busy. mama told me that he exposes bad people and his works is really stressful and needs his attention. dad's always tired, never gives me a piggyback rides, he's grumpy and doesn't loves me like uncle leo. dad's always busy and i don't like this.* 

words came from my mouth, shaking, nervous. sweating a bit, and the breeze freezes me. i turn the page, i am scared, i don't wanna offend him by reading more, because i know what's coming next....

*dear diary, i didn't wrote anything for 8 days, i was tired and nothing interesting happened, expect uncle leo playing with me, but today, mama and dad were busy so he came to pick me up from school, my friends saw him and very impressed, uncle was strong, he gave us an ice-cream treat too. my all friends liked him so much. i felt proud. he let allow to watch movie till night, i never stayed awake this late. my dad is boring, doesn't loves me. he is not strong like uncle, he gets tired easily, he doesn't let me eat ice-cream, he doesn't like me playing games or watching cartoons, always scolds me. i wish uncle leo was my father.*

my words shake, my hands trembles. i didn't wanna read more, i stayed silent, guilty. he spoke "read the next page, fast". he commanded rather says, he was annoyed or angry, i was reading too slowly maybe. i covered my nose a bit, the rotten smell was getting more

*dear diary, i told uncle leo while playing that i wished that he was my dad. he was surprised but said that he would love to have a son like me. i am so happy, he gave me a treat if blueberry pastry. i am so happy today.*

i flipped page few pages and came to that page which has that yellow sticky notes, actually i had to read those pages which had the sticky notes. my legs felt cold, as if they weren't there.

*dear diary, i told mama that i wish uncle leo was my dad. she was surprised and told me not to say that to dad, or else he will get hurt, i didn't wanted to hurt him and become a bad boy so i promised mama to not to tell that to dad.* 

i turn few pages more, finding the yellow sticky note. i found that, i looked at him before reading, i didn't wanted to read more now. i stood there, ashamed of myself. he commanded again "READ THAT FU\*KING PAGE". i stir up and began reading. still covering my nose a bit

*dear diary, dad had to leave for the city because of some work. mama and uncle leo told me today that they both want my wish to be true, so we have to play 'family-family' where leo is my dad and mama playing the role of my mother and i am their son. mama told me not to tell this to dad because he will scold me and everyone for playing game, because he thinks games is just for kids and he won't let us play this game. i had a great time playing this game. uncle and mama played role very well.*

i gulp, i know what's coming now, why the fu\*k i wrote this why, even if i wrote why didn't i just burned it in a bonfire. i never knew this will come to me like this.

*dear diary, we are still playing the game, mum and leo kissed on lips today, i was bit surprised but said they were playing, i relaxed after hearing this. mama told me that dad gonna come today, so they can't play anymore, but promised me to play when dad's not there, i remember mama told me dad doesn't like us playing game.*

god no, please, i can see him getting more angry, "let's not read more, please, don't force me to read this, i can't please". but again he commanded "STOP CRYING LIKE FUCKING DOG AND READ". i wiped my tears and started reading.

*12-march-2015*  
*dear diary, mama putted me on sleep, but i wasn't really sleeping, i saw leo and mama doing cuddles. mama said that they are playing role of a couple, and they want me to feel as real as it could be.* 

i heart sank, i understood all things, i wish i understood that at that time. i flip few pages, it's now april. i look back at it, i quickly forced myself to look into diary, i was disgusted, the smell might make me vomit

*6-april-2015*  
*dear diary, sorry i forgot again to write, i was bit busy. dad scolded me today before leaving for work. i felt so bad, uncle leo came today. he and mama went to the room and closed the door. i could hear some noises but i didn't knew what was it. mama told me that she and he were just discussing some grown-up topics.* 

god, i have realized that a lot years later, from that day i always felt pathetic, i always felt angry at mom. he forced me to read. i turned more pages, another yellow sticky note, i began reading, feeling a pit in my stomach. the rotten smell irritated me

*18-october-2015*  
*dear diary, i am very sad today, i was crying, today, and crying while writing, uncle leo went missing, my parents told me. i didn't went to school today. mama was tensed and dad too. i miss uncle leo a lot.*

i read, it was the last page which i had to read, i closed my diary and looked at him, he was holding a hammer, which had blood. blood of uncle leo and....and mom. she went missing few days ago too. i never expected to see uncle leo like this...after nine years......a skeleton, the rotten smell of her deady body, the rotting flesh laying there.   
my eyes turned teary, i spoke with my words shaking "it was all my mistake, i didn't knew what they are doing, i have no fault in this, please, please, don't kill me" I wanted to explain, how it's all not my fault, i begged, expecting mercy. he came closer and patted my head.   
"Sorry dad". my last words
