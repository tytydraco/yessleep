It was a cold, snowy Wednesday night in the middle of January. I was working at my local movie theatre at that time. Wednesdays were always pretty empty over there, especially during the winter. We usually see a total of 20 to 30 customers for the whole night. I guess not a lot of people enjoy going out in the freezing weather on a weekday.

Anyways, we were a grand total 7 employees working that night, one guy handing out tickets, two girls serving the food, another girl checking the customers’ tickets and one supervisor. I was in charge of cleaning the rooms along with one other guy, who I’ll call Sam.

The first few rooms were basically empty, I mean we were seriously getting paid to do nothing. I saw maybe two people within the first five or six rooms. Usually, I try to initiate conversation with my coworkers while waiting between rooms, but I knew Sam wasn’t the talkative kind so I just left him alone.

Along with cleaning the rooms, we have to check the bathrooms throughout the night and make sure that the rest of the movie theater is clean. After we were done with our sixth room, Sam told me he was going to go check the bathrooms, so I went to clean the main area.

The main area is made up of three parts: the lobby, the mezzanine, which is basically a second floor but considerably smaller than the first floor, and an arcade. I started with the mezzanine. I climbed up the set of stairs, looked around to see if there was anything, checked the trash can to see if it was full—there was a single small bag of popcorn—and signed the small paper to show that I checked on the area.

Next up was the arcade. There were only about ten to twelve games and machines, so it was a relatively quick tour. The sounds of the machines were really the only audible thing around the movie theatre at all times. For some reason they were annoyingly loud and you could hear them from each end of the cinema. Anyways, I was making my way through the arcade when I suddenly heard scratching on one of the arcade machines behind me. It was so soft that I wasn’t even sure if I had heard it correctly. I slowly turned around and… there was nothing. Just the jolly music of the arcade games. At that point I didn’t think that anything weird was going on, it was probably just my mind playing tricks on me because I was tired. I finished cleaning the main area and headed to our seventh room.

There were three people in the huge room, and they all began to leave as the credits rolled. Sam still wasn’t there. I just assumed he was taking his sweet time checking the bathrooms and it’s not like him being there would really speed up the cleaning process. I quickly cleaned the room and got out; still no sign of Sam. It was about 6:45 pm (45 minutes into my shift), and our next room was at 7:38 pm. Realistically, Sam was probably in one of the private bathrooms watching videos or playing a game on his phone. Having worked with him every Wednesday for the past three months, it definitely wasn’t unusual for him to do this.

I still had 15 minutes before my break so I just walked around the movie theatre and chatted with my coworkers. Seven pm came and I went into the break room for my 30 minute break. That’s when I heard a knock at the door, three perfectly spaced knocks to be exact. This was strange, since every employee knew the code to enter the break room. There weren’t any new employees working that night and we punched the code every day to enter the room. I got up and felt a shiver run down my spine. I don’t know why but I just had this feeling that something was off, as if whatever was behind that door had malicious intentions. There wasn’t a peephole so I looked under the door and didn’t see anything. I opened the door with a sweaty hand, prepared to defend myself if anything dangerous were to be behind it. Again, there was nothing but the distant sounds of the arcade machines. I looked around and couldn’t see anyone. I just assumed it was a prank, but I didn’t see where the person could’ve run to hide in time. I definitely felt uneasy but I just closed the door, sat back down, and got back to whatever I was doing.

Thirty minutes came and went and I headed into the eighth room. I made sure to take a peek at the area around the break room before leaving but there was still no sign of anyone. After I was done cleaning the eighth room, I had to take the place of the girl that was checking the tickets of the customers until 8:15 pm so that she could take her break, I’ll call her Sarah. Sam was also supposed to be on break until 8:00 pm and we would meet up at the next room at 8:17 pm.

I always hated the job of checking the tickets because I was in the middle of the main area, so I constantly felt like I was being watched. I also couldn’t leave my spot to go talk to other people, which made the job really boring. This is why I immediately noticed when something moved out of my peripheral vision; if I had to guess it was some sort of shadow, but physical. I quickly turned my head around, so quickly in fact that I slightly hurt my neck. I saw nothing and immediately became paranoid. I couldn’t figure out whether I had just imagined it or if there was truly something that moved, but I had a feeling it wasn’t just my imagination. I looked around everywhere in a panic and probably looked like a total idiot, but at that point I didn’t care, I had to figure out what that thing was. I still had 20 minutes until Sarah came back and I felt unsafe, but I couldn’t just leave or run somewhere. I had to act like what I just saw was a figment of my imagination, but in the back of my mind I knew that what I saw was real.

After an excruciatingly long and stressful 20 minutes, Sarah finally came back from her break and just looked at me like I was crazy—to be fair I probably looked like I was. I asked her if she had seen anything weird tonight, and to my surprise she said yes. She said that throughout the night, she felt as if something was zooming past her incredibly fast, but she never could identify what it was. I told her about what I just experienced and she definitely looked worried after that. She asked if I was joking and I answered “no” in a serious tone. In retrospect, I probably just scared her more than anything.

I left her spot to go clean the next room, expecting to see Sam already waiting. However, I didn’t see him, nor anyone inside the room. Now is probably a good time to explain how the rooms look like.

Basically, there is a narrow hallway leading to the front each room, and two flight of stairs giving access to each row of seats; one on the left and one on the right. The rows of seats are in between the stairs. In the larger rooms, there are also pairs of seats on the other side of the stairs, basically right over the hallway. There is a small wall in front of those pairs of seats to prevent people from falling down onto the hallway. All that to say that as I was climbing up the stairs, I just felt like there was something hiding behind that wall. In fact it’s the same feeling that I got while I was in the break room. I stopped midway through and kind of looked around awkwardly. I told myself that there was nothing there, but my body thought otherwise. Fight or flight kicked in and I didn’t think twice. I ran out of the room as fast as I could without even passing the broom. The cleaning could wait, I did not want to renter that room under any circumstances. There was something evil in there, something dangerous. I didn’t know what, but I knew it was there.

When I got outside, my heart was pounding and I felt like it would just explode inside of my chest. I was also sweating on every part of my body, like I had just run an entire marathon. I took a minute to calm myself down and called Sam on his walkie talkie, I knew he had one on him because I saw it earlier while we were cleaning the rooms together. I waited a few seconds; no answer. I called him a second time, still complete silence.

I was now worried for him. On any normal day, I would’ve just assumed that he fell asleep in one of the bathrooms, but this wasn’t a normal day. I did not want to have to clean another room alone, so I went to check on the bathrooms, hoping to find him there. I went into each bathroom of the cinema, and didn’t find any sign of him, until I checked on one of the private bathrooms. It was locked.

That’s when I got an idea: I could talk on my walkie talkie, and if Sam was in there, I would hear my voice on the other side of the door. I called him and nearly jumped when I heard Sam’s walkie talkie repeating what I had just said. Sam was really in there, and for some reason he hadn’t responded to all three of my calls.

I went to get the supervisor, told him that Sam had been missing for over an hour and a half and his location. He got the key to unlock the door and headed to the private bathroom. I was starting to fall behind on the cleaning schedule so I reluctantly went to our next room while the supervisor checked on Sam. At that point I didn’t know if I should have been pissed or worried for Sam. On one hand, he was leaving me alone to clean the entire movie theatre, but on the other hand, I was worried that something had happened to him. Afterall, I sensed that something had been stalking and taunting me for the whole night. What if that thing got to Sam and done something to him? He could be in serious trouble. And that’s not even taking into account Sarah’s experience.

I stood in front of the next room for a good 30 seconds, unsure if I should just skip it and risk getting yelled at for not having cleaned another room. Against my own wishes, I decided to at least check if the room was clean before signing the paper and leaving. I told myself that after all, nothing was scarier than an angry boss, especially not my imaginary sense of something stalking me. I walked down a hallway and saw a cup lying straight up on a chair’s arm rest, at the last row of the room. It was like it had been purposefully put there, just to make my job a bit harder and more annoying.

I started walking up the stairs to go get the cup, still feeling like something was lurking in one of the dark corners of the room. My legs were shaking and it felt like every step up the flight of stairs was more exhausting than the previous one. As soon as I got to the final row, I heard a loud bang, and that movie screen that was previously showing the end credits suddenly went dark. The screen projector had fallen down. “Fallen” is the wrong word, these things can’t fall, someone or something had pushed it down.

I ran down the stairs like never before. I tripped and hurt myself really badly but I was functioning on pure adrenaline at that point. I immediately ran to the private bathroom, to see if the supervisor had found Sam. The door was unlocked and I swung the thing open without even thinking. I will never forget what I saw on the other side.

There were the two bodies of Sam and the supervisor, both looking like they had been brutally mauled by a bear, if the bear had supernatural strength. There was blood scattered everywhere in the bathroom; on the floor, on the walls, and even on the ceiling. I just stood there, shocked at what I was seeing. Millions of thoughts raced through my mind. Was the thing that taunted me the whole night the same thing that killed Sam and the supervisor? Was I the next one on its list? How did I not hear the screams of the supervisor as he was getting murdered only a hundred meters from me?

I did not have time to answer all of these questions. I reached for my phone to call 911, but it wasn’t in my pocket. I must have accidently dropped it while I was running for my life. I looked for another employee to get them to call the police, but it’s like they had all vanished out of thin air. I ran behind the food counters to look for the two girls serving the food. They weren’t there, so I sped to the back hallway behind the food counters. I stopped as soon as I saw them. They were laying on the ground in the same state that I found Sam and the supervisor in. It’s like they had been eaten from the inside out. It was clear that they were already dead, I couldn’t save them. At this point all I could do was pray that their death was quick.

That’s when I heard it, another sound of something falling to the ground, something much larger this time. I turned around and one of the arcade games was laying front first on the ground, like it had been pushed from the back. These things must have weighted at least one thousands pounds, if not double that. No human could’ve caused this to happened.

I could not escape out of the movie theatre from the main entrance. The arcade was right next to the main entrance. Whatever the thing that pushed the arcade game was would definitely hear or see me, and I would end up with the same fate as the two girls that were laying on the floor right next to me. This meant that I had two options.

My first option was to run down the hallway and escape from the back exit, but I would risk being heard by the thing because that exit door was really loud, and I also would have to get back home without any phone or cash on me in the freezing weather. My second option was to lock myself inside the security room only a few meters away. I would have access to all the cameras but I would have no way to escape until authorities found or until the thing went away, and I didn’t know how long that take.

I went with the second option, the thing was faster and stronger than me. I would stand no chance if it learned of my location. With that in mind, I slowly made my way into the security room, opened to large door and locked it from the inside, hoping it didn’t hear that little “click” the lock made.

I took a moment to clear my mind of everything and slapped myself a few times to make sure I wasn’t just dreaming the whole thing. I heard more and more arcade machines fall down as I waited nervously inside the security room. After a while the sounds of machines banging and breaking on the floor stopped and I looked over to the cameras. One of them gave a clear view of the main area, and it was just completely trashed. Almost all of the arcade machines were broken or laying on ground, trash cans were completely destroyed and there was trash all over the main area, tables and chairs was flipped over; in other words it looked like there had been an all out brawl, but it was the work of only one thing, which was nowhere to be found.

That’s when I noticed a small group of people get out of the rooms to check what was going on. There was only a handful of them, but they all gathered together and made their way to the main area. They stood at the edge of the hallways leading to the main area, looking confused and scared. I already knew what was coming, I wanted to warn them but I couldn’t, there was no way for me to alert them of the creature from the security room. I tried looking away but I just couldn’t. My body froze in fear as I looked at the monitor.

I watched in horror as a creature emerged from a dark corner of the main area. It seemed like it was a shadow of something like a dog or a wolf, but it definitely wasn’t an animal. It had pure white eyes and teeth that looked like they could cut metal in half. It was not something natural.

At first it just walked slowly on all fours, and then it launched onto the unlucky victims at supersonic speed. It started devouring them one by one, splashing blood everywhere in the process. Some tried to run away but their efforts were in vain. They stood no chance against this demonic creature. At the end there was nothing but the mangled corpses of the once alive customers. Not even the children were spared.

I just stood there, fear paralyzing me. It happened so quickly that I barely had time to react to everything that just unfolded. After feasting on the customers, the creature started smelling the air. I think it sensed that something was still alive in the vicinity. That thing was me. I couldn’t just run out of the room and escape. There was a good 30 meters between the security room and the back exit. The creature would hear the door unlock and chase after me. I had just seen how quickly it can move, and I knew that I stood no chance against it. So I just stayed in the security room, not making any noise.

My breathing was heavy and I felt like I was about to have a heart attack. I put a hand over my mouth to stop myself from making too much noise. If that thing could smell me from hundreds of meters away, there was also the possibility of it being able to hear the lightest of sounds.

I stayed in the security room for what felt like days, but I knew it had only been a few hours. I periodically looked over to the time displayed on the monitor. Sometimes I felt like an entire hour had passed only for the monitor to tell me that it had only been 5 minutes since I last looked at the time. I also glanced at the security cameras every now and then. I tried to avoid looking at them because I would either see the creature walking unnaturally around the movie theatre or the bloody remains of its victims. Either way, I just terrified myself more and more every time I looked at the monitor. Every now and then, the creature strolled past the security room. I swear I could feel its evil aura pass by me, and I would stop breathing without even noticing. One time I even came close to passing out because I held my breath for so long.

But the worst part were the screams of the poor souls that entered the cinema or got out of a room every now and then. The creature just feasted on everyone it saw, without exception. More and more bodies accumulated everywhere in the movie theatre. It was also almost completely dark inside the place. The only light came from the moon outside, but even then it barely lit up the movie theatre. I guessed that thing had found a way to break the power source. It was probably smarter than I gave it credit for.

It was 2:27 AM when the scratching began. My shift had ended over 2 hours ago, but I was still stuck in this nightmare situation. At first, the scratching wasn’t too intense. Only a few scratches then it left, but as the hours passed, the creature spent more and more time in front of the security room, sniffing under the door and scratching more aggressively each time it came back. At this point I had nothing to lose, the creature knew I was in there but it was toying with me. I knew that it could just bust down the door if it wanted to. I saw how it had knocked over the arcade games only hours ago.

I guess no one filled a missing person’s report or something of that sort because the police, or any emergency personnel, never showed up. I had to wait in the security room alone and scared, with a deadly creature waiting right outside.

Eventually sunrise came and the creature went to the third floor where all the movie projectors were. It was so dark in there that I could barely see anything, but I’m pretty sure I saw it lay down and start sleeping. I waited another 30 minutes before unlocking the door. It was almost 8:00 am. I hadn’t slept the entire night and I looked like a mental asylum patient. When I got out of the security room, I saw the scratch marks. A hole at least 5 centimeters deep was formed inside the door. A few more centimeters and the thing could’ve burst a hole through the door and devoured me like it had done with every other person it saw. Other than that there were scratch marks everywhere on the door, and even a little bit on the walls. I didn’t stick around to look at the rest of the gruesome details of the scene. I walked past my two dead coworkers. Their blood had already dried up and I could see bloody footprints leading into every possible hallway from the security room.

I slowly made my way to the back exit and opened the door. I then sprinted out of this hellscape in the direction of my house. It was still freezing outside, and I hadn’t slept in the entire night, but I just kept running. I didn’t even look back to see if the creature was following. It could very well chase and kill me if it wanted to, but I think it was tired as well.

I now live in an entire other continent from where this took place. I changed my identity and I haven’t stepped foot in a movie theatre since. I tried searching for a news story about the incident but it seems the authority made a good job hiding what happened. To be honest I don’t even know how they did, considering the damage that had been done. For all I know, I’m considered dead or missing in my home country. Not like I care because I’m staying as far away as whatever fuck that thing is.

This is the first time I’ve told anyone this story. I don’t fear being judged on the Internet since I’m anonymous. I’m not stupid enough to try to convince people of what happened to me. You can believe me if you want, but I know what happened on that Wednesday night.
