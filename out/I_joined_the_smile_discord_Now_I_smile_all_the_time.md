Discord and gaming became my life during the pandemic. I have friends all over the world, we've laughed together, cried together and everything inbetween. Finding a good community can make the days that much brighter. My friend group met in this large gaming server, then we made a smaller one, just for us. We spoke about life, our pasts, everything. A real group of friends, even over the long distances.

One day someone posted a link. "Come join the smile discord!". I had no qualms about doing so. This is a trusted friend, right? He'd never share something harmful, Surely? I clicked the invite link. The info popped up "A community to make you smile! Only good vibes and fun". I smiled, surely nothing bad could happen here? I was so naive. 

Meme channels, joke channels, cat videos - the server really was filled with everything to make you smile. Slowly over the days then weeks I started sharing stuff, met some people, made friends. The server was truly a safe and happy place. I found myself hanging out in my friendship server less. But I didn't miss it. I'd found a new community of awesome people to be with. Sometimes people just move on, you know? Nothing personal. It's just the Internet. Happens all the time.

The weeks turned into months, I was gaming less. Even my friends stopped asking me to play, none of them were active in smile. One day I was pinged in the server "hey <redacted>, I've sent you a dm. It'll probably show as a message request".

I clicked straight to my dms. I smiled as I read:

"Hey, we've noticed you around the server being totally awesome! We're taking on some new moderators and think you'd be perfect to join the team! If you have any questions, just let me know. No pressure for an answer right away if you need some time to think about it."

I was grinning like teenager who'd just asked out their crush and they had said yes. I'd never been a moderator on discord before, but I jumped at the opportunity. I typed out my reply accepting straight away. I didn't need to ask any questions. I loved the community and I was all too happy to help out. 

I took to being a moderator like a duck to water. I truly loved it. By now I wasn't gaming at all, all my time was spent on smile, connecting with people, deleting and banning as people broke the rules. It was so much fun, being able to help a truly amazing community.

Before long, I accepted becoming an admin. That's when things got a little weird. There was a channel, with a link to another server. "The biggest smile". OK, so this was some sort of inside, higher, more private server I guessed. I asked about it, and the other admins said it wasn't mandatory, just another smaller place to hang out, with even better content. I was sold. I clicked that server invite, not realising how much my life would change forever.

The channel names were a bit weird as I scrolled though. "Old-people", "young-couples", crap like that. I was confused. Untill I clicked the channels. I pushed myself away from the computer as my speakers filled with the sounds of agony as I watched an old man with tears spilling down his cheeks. What the fuck is this? The camera panned out. I won't describe what it showed, it's far too messed up. So much blood, how could that have come from 1 person? I watched as he tried to speak, but no words would form. His eyes showed his terror.

I clicked through channels, more videos showed the true low of humanity. Children, couples, so many people who were all being tortured. 

I need to leave, I thought to myself, and I tried. But there was no leave button. What the hell is going on? I couldn't even click off the server. 

Suddenly, the little red notification icon flashes up further down the channel list. I scrolled. This category wasn't here before when I'd looked through. I was sure of that. Each channel name was the name of someone in the server. Sure enough, I'd been pinged in the channel with my name.

"Hey <redacted>, so glad to see you! I hope you like it here, I think you'll fit right in. This server truly makes people smile for life."

My mind fixated on that last sentence for a full minute. Other people started typing. My heart began to pound, and my ears seemed to be filled with the ocean, the sound was almost deafening. Welcome messages began to pour in. I only recognised a few names. My hands shook as I reached forward to begin typing. I figured acting casual would be the best thing to do. But I knew this was beyond messed up. Some sort of snuff community was not one I wanted to be in. 

I thanked them for inviting me and said I was excited to be here. Every word I typed filled me with an increasing sense of dread. Why was I doing this? Why didn't I just shut my computer down and never come back? 

Another ping. 

"So we like to do a little meet and greet when someone joins, will you be available tonight at 20:00? It'll be in voice chat. Its always a blast and it's *sure* to bring the biggest smile of your life."

What the fuck do I do now? I didn't want to go. I didn't want this. I just wanted to hang out and share memes, laugh, and yes, smile. 

"Hi, yeah sure, let's do this! So excited to meet you all in voice chat!" 

"Great, see you then. We can't wait to finally meet."

OK, I had 5 hours to figure things out. The minutes ticked by, I still couldn't click off the server, I tried everything. I even thought of deleting my account but I couldn't get into my settings. I couldn't even click off discord itself. The minutes turned into hours. Finally, I decided enough was enough. I stood up and walked to my door, intent on going for a walk. But as my hand touched the handle, a discord call started. I looked at my PC monitor, as my eyes reached it the call accepted. 

"Don't do that." A voice I didn't recognise commanded, and an image popped onto the screen. Is that.. Is that my bedroom? My head left the handle and I walked towards the monitor. I watched as the screen showed me my movements. As I reached the PC, the call ended. 

Crap. How the hell were they watching me? What the hell is going on. I don't even own a webcam, how could they do this? It didn't make sense. None of this crap made sense. It was at this point I realised just how trapped I was. 

I knew I didn't have a choice. In 45 minutes I was gonna have to sit in a voice chat with stalkers. I sat in the chair, my elbows planted on my desk and my head in my hands. How did I even get to this point? I just wanted to help a server I had fallen in love with, that had become my happy place. I lifted my head up. Maybe there was some information in the other channels with people's usernames? I clicked on 1 at random. There was not any messages with chatting, not even a welcome. There was just 1 video, posted by a bot called "Say cheese!". I clicked play. A young womans face appeared, she looked scared. The same voice I'd heard tell me not to leave my bedroom spoke "Do you want to smile always?". There was hesitation in the woman's face, her eyes wide with fear spoke of her reluctance. But her voice, weak and defeated, as if she'd given up spoke the words "Yes, please.". What happened next will haunt me forever. A blade appeared in front of the camera. "Smile wide." She did as she was told, her teeth showing. The blade moved forward, and cut threw the corners of her mouth like her skin and muscle was butter. She screamed as the knife came away, and the cuts went up her cheeks, blood dripping. I clicked away from the channel. I didn't want to see any more. 

I looked at the time, how the hell had only 5 minutes gone by? I stood up and began to pace. My phone was turned off, and I couldn't turn it back on, even after I plugged it in to the charger. There was nothing I could do. I now knew what was gonna happen. And I knew there was no way to stop it.

**Update.**

Hey guys, its been a week since my meet and greet! Things are so good, I was mistaken about the biggest smile discord. Its a great place to be! I smile all the time now. If you ever get the chance to join, you won't regret it I promise! Love and hugs, <redacted>.
