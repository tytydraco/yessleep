I’m not trying to spin some campfire scare.

I just need to put this somewhere that isn’t my head.

For the last week, every time I close my eyes to sleep I see that door. Worse than that, I hear it—not creaking or slamming, but breathing. Like something on the other side is pressing up against it just hard enough to bow the wood.

I know how it sounds. I know what it makes me sound like.

But I can tell you exactly where I was, what trail I took, and when my phone stopped getting a signal. I can show you the photos from before everything went sideways. None of that fixes the part where, if I’m being honest, I have a real, concrete memory gap right where the worst part should be.

I remember walking up to the door.

I remember reaching for the handle.

Everything after that is like a thumb smeared across wet ink.

So I’ll start at the last place I’m sure of, and you can decide if you think a brain can just snap like this on a casual weekend trip.


I was camping alone on purpose.

I don’t mean that in an edgy, “no friends” way. My group of friends from college has a running tradition—at least one big trip a year if we can swing it. Rivers, mountains, desert, whatever we can agree on. Lately, though, everyone’s schedules have gotten shredded by jobs and kids and random disasters. The last three trips died in the group chat forty-eight hours before we were supposed to leave.

I kept catching myself scrolling back through old photos of hikes, seeing stupid grins and muddy boots, and realizing that apparently I’d started needing other people as an excuse to go outside.

So I took three days off and drove into a national forest I’m not going to name. There’s a lake up there you can only hike into. The closest trailhead is down a rutted dirt road, the kind where you spend half the drive wondering if you’re about to bottom out and lose your oil pan, and the other half listening to every new rattle and deciding if that’s “normal car noise” or “you’re about to die.”

I parked at the empty lot around noon. There was one other truck, coated in dust, no one in sight. The air had that sharp pine smell I’ve never found anywhere else—sap and dirt and something cold, even in August.

I signed the trail register at the board: name, number in party (“1”), destination (“Lake”), expected return (“Sunday, before dark”).

I remember pausing with the pen over the paper and thinking: At least if I get eaten by a bear, they’ll have a starting point.

It was a dumb little joke. But I remember it because of what the ranger said later about my handwriting changing.

The hike up to the lake was uneventful in the best way. Four miles of switchbacks, then a long ridge that gave me glimpses of the water through breaks in the trees. There were old, faded blazes on the trunks—white paint, flaking off—but the trail was clear enough and my pack wasn’t trying to kill me for once. I’d packed light: cheap tent, borrowed stove, three granola bars, and one gas-station turkey sandwich I regretted as soon as I ate it.

I set up camp on the north side of the lake. It was a small clearing someone else had clearly used before: half-burned fire ring, a log dragged into a rough bench. The shore was a narrow strip of pebbles, then the water dropped off fast. The opposite side was just a wall of evergreens going straight up, no nice, welcoming beach, just trees and stone.

The first weird thing was how quiet it was.

You get used to a certain forest soundtrack when you hike enough. Wind in the branches, birds arguing about whatever birds argue about, insects, the occasional distant aircraft. This felt… muted. Like someone had turned the volume down a few clicks. Nothing dramatic, just enough that I noticed when I took my pack off and realized I couldn’t hear any birds at all.

I told myself it was the time of day, or the weather, or some natural thing I didn’t know enough about. The sky was clear. No storm brewing. No obvious reason for it.

I made camp. I wrestled with the tent zipper for way too long. I boiled water. I ate freeze-dried chili that tasted like salt and cardboard and regret. I watched the sun slide down behind the ridge and turn the lake into one big, dark mirror.

It wasn’t until after dinner that I saw the other trail.

It wasn’t marked. If anything, it looked like the opposite of a trail—just a place where the undergrowth thinned slightly between two big spruce trees. The gap was straight behind my tent, leading away from the lake into denser forest.

I wouldn’t have looked twice if it weren’t for the ground.

Everywhere else near my camp, the forest floor was the usual chaotic mess: fallen sticks, dead leaves, pine cones, little mounds of moss. Here, though, the soil was packed down. Not in a single line, like deer prints or a human path, but in this wide, flat strip, maybe four feet across, like something heavy had been dragged back and forth over the same route for a long time.

I walked a few steps down that not-quite-trail, just enough to see that it continued beyond the first screen of trees. It ran straight, too. Trails don’t do that out there; they wander around rocks, fallen logs, erosion. This one went like a shot, vanishing into shadow.

The GPS on my phone still had a little juice and a sliver of signal. According to the topo map, there wasn’t supposed to be anything in that direction but increasingly steep hillside.

I remember standing there, holding the phone, and telling myself: You are not going to go stomping off into unknown terrain in the evening, alone, for no reason.

So, obviously, the next morning that’s exactly what I did.

I woke up with that weird, instant awareness like someone had snapped their fingers next to my ear.

The forest was even quieter than before. No breeze, no birds, no insects. The lake might as well have been a slab of black glass. My watch said 7:12 a.m.

I climbed out, stretched, made coffee. The little strip of not-trail was still there, just as straight and wrong-looking as the night before.

I know it’s going to sound like I’m trying to justify a bad decision, but I did think it through. I had a compass, a map, extra water, headlamp, first aid kit. I wasn’t planning to go far. Just follow whatever that packed-down strip was for half an hour, satisfy my curiosity, then come back and fish or read like a normal person.

I told myself I’d be back by 9:00 at the latest.

I remember that number. I remember saying it out loud in that empty clearing, like I was making a promise to someone I couldn’t see.

Then I grabbed my daypack and stepped into the trees.

If you’ve ever bushwhacked off-trail, you know how quickly the world changes.

The light drops out. The ground gets unpredictable. Every step becomes a negotiation with roots and rocks and hidden holes.

This wasn’t like that.

The undergrowth on either side was the usual tangle—ferns, shrubs, fallen branches—but the strip I was walking on stayed bare and smooth. Not perfectly; there were occasional roots to step over, but nothing like the chaos around it. It was like someone had taken a big eraser and dragged it across the forest floor in a ruler-straight line.

I kept checking my compass. The trail… corridor… whatever it was, ran almost exactly due north, up a gradual slope. According to my map, there should’ve been a small ravine cutting across my path about ten minutes in, a seasonal creek bed.

I never saw it.

The ground rose and fell a little, but there was no sign of any water, past or present. The strip just kept going, steady as a hallway.

The further I went, the more wrong the silence felt. Silence isn’t just “nothing.” It feels a certain way. This felt heavy. Thick. After a while, I realized I couldn’t even hear my own footsteps as clearly as I should. The crunch of soil and twigs under my boots sounded like it was coming through a wall.

Every few minutes, I’d stop, turn around, and look back the way I’d come.

The way back always looked… off.

Nothing specific I could point at, just this subtle misalignment. The trees felt closer together. The light looked a little dimmer, like I was staring down a long tunnel. Once, when I turned to look, I had this sudden lurch of vertigo, like the ground had tilted under me, and I had to grab a tree to steady myself.

“What the hell,” I muttered, just to hear my own voice.

The word fell flat in the air. No echo at all. Not even that soft bounce you get between tree trunks.

I checked my watch.

7:40 a.m.

I remember that clearly too, because I told myself I’d go ten more minutes and then turn around, no matter what.

The corridor kinked then, just slightly—a small bend to the left, the first deviation from its rigid straightness. My stomach did something weird when I saw that bend, like it had already decided it didn’t want to know what was around it.

That’s where I saw the door.

If I asked you to picture “a door in the woods,” you’d probably imagine some horror movie thing—rotting wood, rusty handle, dark stain around the frame. Something that screams, in big neon letters, This Is Bad.

This wasn’t like that.

It was a perfectly normal, modern, interior door. White. Six-panel. You could’ve pulled it straight out of a suburban hallway. It stood by itself, no frame, no wall, just planted in the middle of that bare strip of earth like the forest had grown around it and politely left it some space.

There was even a little gap at the bottom where you could see the ground under it, the way you can sometimes see carpet under a closed door in a house.

I stopped so abruptly my pack bumped into my shoulders.

Every part of my brain lit up at once. This is a prank. This is an art project. This is some weird backcountry installation. I looked for, I don’t know, cameras, wires, footprints. Anything.

There was nothing. The packed-down strip ran right up to the door on both sides and continued past it, but thinner, fainter somehow, like a path worn in dust rather than dirt.

I walked around it slowly.

From the side, it still looked like a door—just thinner, like the thickness had been shaved down. From the back, it was the same white panels, the same handle. No hinges either side.

I did three full circles.

Here’s the part I know you won’t believe: every time I circled around, I ended up back where I’d started without feeling myself make that last little turn.

I’d step past what I thought was the “side” and find myself looking at the “front” again. The handle was always on my right. The lake, which should’ve been behind me, felt… absent. Not farther away, not closer. Just like the fact that it existed had been filed under “later” in my head without my permission.

I took a step back and realized my mouth had gone dry.

My heart wasn’t pounding yet. My body hadn’t caught up. But there was a high, thin pressure at the back of my skull, like altitude, except I was nowhere near high enough for that.

My phone said I had no service now. No surprise. The time was 7:49 a.m.

Ten minutes, I thought.

I can turn around now. I can go back to camp and pretend I never saw this.

Instead, I reached out and put my hand on the knob.

It was cool. Not cold, not hot. Just a neutral room-temperature kind of cool, which made no sense out here in the morning air. I could feel the shape of my fingerprints on the metal.

The entire forest seemed to lean in.

That’s what it felt like, anyway. Like the air tightened, like every branch and leaf was paying attention.

My thumb rested on the latch.

The next thing I remember clearly is being on my knees, puking into the dirt.

When I came back to myself, I was three or four feet from the door, braced on one hand, my pack half off my shoulders. The taste of bile burned in my throat. My eyes were streaming.

The door was open about an inch.

Just an inch. The slightest sliver of darkness between the edge and the jamb that shouldn’t have existed, because there was no wall for there to even be a jamb in.

I don’t remember turning the knob. I don’t remember the door moving.

What I do remember is the smell.

Not rot. Not anything dramatic. Just… room air. Stale, faintly dusty, with the ghost of something chemical under it. Like an office that had been shut up for a long time. Dry carpet, old paint, long-dead air conditioning.

A breath of air slid out of that crack and across my face. It was warmer than the morning air, maybe by a degree or two. My skin crawled like I’d just leaned into someone else’s exhale.

“Okay,” I whispered, voice shaking. “Okay, that’s enough.”

I grabbed the edge of the door with my left hand, careful not to let more of whatever was inside out, and pushed it shut.

It moved smoothly. Too smoothly. No creak, no catch. It just swung until it clicked, soft as a whisper, into place.

Everything else came back at once.

Suddenly I could hear my own breathing again, ragged in my ears. I heard a single, solitary bird call somewhere far off, like someone hit unpause on a track. My heart finally realized something was wrong and started hammering.

Every instinct I had screamed at me to run, but I forced myself to walk. I backed away from the door, watching it, until the corridor curved and trees slid between us.

Then I turned and hurried as fast as I could without actually breaking into a sprint.

I told myself I hadn’t gone far. Twenty, twenty-five minutes at most. If I stayed on the packed strip, I’d be back at my camp in no time.

Except the strip wasn’t there anymore.

The ground was just… forest.

Leaf litter. Roots. Moss. No clean, bare line. The trees looked different too, closer together, leaning in strange directions that made my eyes want to slide off them.

I stopped dead, one hand on a trunk.

I turned slowly in a circle.

Behind me: nothing but trees.

In front of me: nothing but trees.

The compass clipped to my pack strap spun half an inch back and forth, like it was thinking about what to do.

You know that prickly feeling you get when you realize you’re lost, even a little bit? Not “I took the wrong turn at the grocery store” lost, but “If I keep making bad decisions, this could become a problem” lost? Multiply that by a hundred and add the memory of an impossible door breathing on you.

I took a few long breaths to keep from hyperventilating. I closed my eyes and tried to picture the way I’d come: up the corridor, slight bend to the left, over that one root, past the deadfall with the split trunk—

Except as I stood there, trying to build the map in my head, the details kept blurring. The deadfall: was it on my left or my right? The root: was it big enough that I had to step high, or had I just noticed it out of the corner of my eye?

I opened my eyes again.

For a second—just a second—I saw the door ten feet in front of me, perfectly centered between two trees.

White panels. Silver knob. Standing alone.

I blinked, and there was nothing there but a patch of bare soil.

I laughed once, short and way too loud, like a bark that surprised even me.

“Nope,” I said. “Nope. Nope nope nope.”

Talking out loud made it real. It also made something else real: the feeling that I was being watched.

The forest was still. No movement in the branches. No sound. But there was a pressure between my shoulder blades, a weight on the back of my neck, like someone was standing just behind me, just outside the line where my peripheral vision could pick them up.

I didn’t turn around.

I picked a direction—south, according to the compass, which was at least holding steady again—and started walking

I wish I could tell you some epic survival saga followed. Days of wandering, building shelters, eating bugs.

What actually happened was much smaller and, somehow, much worse.

I walked.

The forest didn’t change.

The angle of the light shifted a little, but I couldn’t tell if that was the sun or just clouds messing with me. The trees stayed the same kind of trees. The slope under my feet didn’t steepen or flatten. I didn’t cross any streams, though according to my map I should’ve hit that ravine no matter what direction I went long before.

The worst part was the way things repeated.

At one point, I found a fallen log with a peculiar pattern of fungus on it—orange disks in a rough spiral. I noticed it, stepped over it, kept going.

Ten minutes later, I saw the same log again. Same fungus spiral. Same broken branch leaning against it at the same angle, like a prop that had been reset.

I’m not an idiot. I know how easy it is to get turned around in the woods and end up walking in circles. I also know I had been checking my compass and keeping a steady bearing. I hadn’t turned enough to loop back. Not like that.

I started marking trees as I passed them. Little cuts in the bark with the knife on my belt. Clean, diagonal slices.

I walked for what felt like another half hour.

When I saw one of my own marks ahead of me, fresh and wet on the bark, my vision tunneled for a second.

My watch said 7:12 a.m.

That wasn’t possible. I’d checked it. I remembered checking it. Time doesn’t just… go backwards.

I tapped it like an idiot in an old cartoon. The second hand ticked, steady and indifferent.

Somewhere behind me, a hinge creaked.

It was the tiniest sound. So soft I might’ve missed it if everything else hadn’t been so quiet. A little metallic sigh, like a door opening just a crack in a house two rooms away.

I turned, slowly.

There was nothing there.

But the pressure of being watched sharpened, focused. It felt like a finger tracing the line from my eyes to some point in the air a few yards away.

Without realizing I was going to do it, I lifted my hand and mimed turning a knob.

The air in front of me shifted.

That’s the only way I can describe it. A shimmer, like heat above asphalt, except it was cold around me. For a heartbeat, I saw the edge of something flat and white, hanging there between one step and the next.

Then it was gone, and the forest rushed back too close, like I’d been about to step through a doorway that had changed its mind.

I ran then.

I’ll own that. Survival instinct, panic, whatever you want to call it. I shoved my map into my pocket, jammed my compass into my hand, and sprinted in the direction that felt like “away,” branches whipping at my face, roots grabbing at my boots.

The forest changed.

Not gradually. Not like a natural transition from one ecosystem to another. One second I was crashing through thick undergrowth; the next, the ground dropped and I was in the middle of a stand of dead trees, their trunks grey and smooth like bones, no branches until way up high.

My ankle twisted on the slope and I went down hard, skidding on loose soil and old bark. I felt something rip in my shoulder. Dirt filled my mouth.

I lay there, wind knocked out of me, staring up at the thin strip of sky.

All I could hear was my own breathing.

And under that, very faint, like it was coming through a long hallway: a sound like someone trying the handles of a lot of doors all at once.

Little metallic clicks, overlapping.

Clickclickclickclick.

I squeezed my eyes shut.

“Stop,” I whispered. “Please.”

The sound stopped.

I opened my eyes.

I was on the shore of the lake.

The shift was so abrupt I thought for a second I’d passed out and woken up later.

My tent was right there, a few yards away. The fire ring. The stupid log bench.

The trees around the clearing were the right trees again: thick trunks, green needles, familiar patterns of bark. The air smelled like pine and water and old ashes.

My knee throbbed. My shoulder burned. Dry leaves clung to my clothes. I had not imagined running.

I checked my watch with shaking hands.

7:13 a.m.

My first thought was that the watch had broken earlier and just now kicked back on.

Then I looked at the lake.

The light on the water was wrong. Not in an “alien sky” way, just not matching the time. When I’d left camp, the sun had been just clearing the ridge, throwing long shadows. Now the light looked like late morning. Higher, harsher. The angle of the shade under the trees didn’t line up with the numbers on my wrist.

My phone’s screen was black. No amount of button-mashing woke it up, even though I knew I’d charged it fully before I left.

I told myself I’d figure it out later. Hypoglycemia, shock, dehydration. Something with a name.

I half-stumbled to my tent and yanked the zipper open.

My pack was inside, just where I’d left it.

The thing that made me drop to my knees wasn’t anything missing or added.

It was the smell.

My tent smelled like that door.

Stale, faintly dusty, with that same almost-chemical undernote. Not strong. Not like something had been spilled. Just… present, in every fiber of the fabric, in my sleeping bag, in my clothes.

Like this little nylon triangle had been sitting in a closed room for a very long time.

I backed out so fast I almost fell over, caught my heel on a rock, nearly did this stupid half-cartwheel into the fire ring. It would’ve been a perfect camping fail video if anyone had been there to record it.

The forest felt too small now. The sky felt too far.

I don’t remember breaking camp. I know I must have, because when the ranger found me later, my pack was fully loaded, my tent rolled and strapped on top. But my next clear memory is of walking down the main trail with the lake behind me and tears drying on my face, telling myself with each step:

Just get to the car. Just get to the car. Just get to the car.

I didn’t pass anyone on the way down.

The lot was full when I got there.

There were at least eight vehicles, all newer than mine, coated in a more recent layer of dust. The bulletin board had a new laminated sign about fire restrictions that I swear hadn’t been there the day before.

There was a ranger truck too. A guy in uniform was standing by the register, talking to a couple in bright hiking clothes. He looked up when he heard my boots on the gravel, and his expression shifted from bored to something else fast.

“Whoa,” he said, stepping toward me. “You okay, man?”

I opened my mouth to say yes, to lie, but what came out was a raw, cracked sound that made all three of them freeze.

The next few minutes are a blur of questions.

Name. Where had I been. How long had I been up there. Did I have any injuries. Did I know what day it was.

That last one tripped me.

“Friday,” I said, because I’d left on Thursday and planned to be back Sunday, so this had to be Friday.

The ranger’s expression shifted in this small, practiced way that told me he was trying not to spook me.

“It’s Monday,” he said. “You signed in on Thursday and never signed out. We’ve had a SAR team on standby all weekend. I was actually heading up to do a sweep when you walked out.”

I laughed.

I couldn’t help it. It just burst out, and once it started, it didn’t sound like me anymore. Too high, too thin.

They sat me down. They gave me water. They insisted on checking me over. My knees were scraped, my shoulder bruised, my wrist swollen. I had a sunburn I shouldn’t have had time to get.

I kept looking past them at the trailhead, half expecting to see a white door standing between the trees. It never showed.

When the ranger went to fill out the incident form, he asked me to write down what had happened, just the broad strokes. I took the clipboard with a hand that didn’t feel like mine and scrawled something about getting turned around, losing the trail, making camp, finding my way back.

Later, in the emergency room, a nurse would look at that form and then at me and say, “You write with your right hand, right?”

“Yeah,” I said, confused.

“Because this is all left-handed.”

⸻

They kept me for observation until the next day.

Dehydration, they said. Maybe a minor concussion. Exposure. The doctors were careful not to say “hallucination,” but I could feel it in the way they circled certain questions.

No one had a good answer for the time gap. The best theory was that I’d gotten lost, panicked, and blacked out stretches of wandering. That I’d set up some kind of emergency shelter I couldn’t remember, then eventually stumbled back to the lake, packed up, and left.

The ranger who picked me up stopped by my room that evening. He was older than I’d thought at the trailhead, with deep lines around his eyes and a wedding ring that had seen better days.

“You scared us pretty good,” he said, pulling up a chair. “We don’t like having names up on the board without an exit time.”

“I’m sorry,” I said automatically.

He shook his head. “You came back out. That’s what matters.”

He hesitated then, tapping his fingers on his knee, looking like he was arguing with himself.

“Listen,” he said finally. “I’m not supposed to say this kind of thing. Liability, policy, all that. But I’ve been doing this job a long time. Long enough to know when somebody’s just spinning a story to cover their own screw-ups, or because they don’t want a ticket.”

He scratched his jaw, glanced at the doorway, then back at me.

“I don’t get that from you,” he said. “I think you’re… trying to make sense of something that doesn’t fit anywhere.”

I didn’t trust my voice, so I just nodded.

He reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out a folded piece of paper.

“This is a photocopy of the trail register from Thursday,” he said. “I’m not really supposed to hand these out, so do me a favor and don’t wave it around.”

He unfolded it and pointed.

There was my name. My handwriting. The date. Number in party: 1. Destination: Lake.

Expected return: Monday.

The “Sunday, before dark” I remembered writing wasn’t there. In its place, in a squiggly, off-kilter version of my own hand, was a single word:

“Door.”

My mouth went dry in this abrupt, stupid way, like I’d swallowed sand.

“That’s… that’s not mine,” I said, even though I could see that it was.

He shrugged, but it was tight, not casual.

“How long were you planning to stay, originally?” he asked.

“Thursday to Sunday,” I said. “I have work Tuesday.”

“Today is Tuesday,” he said gently.

I could chalk that up to a lot of things.

Stress. Hypothermia. My brain trying to patch itself.

I could chalk up the smell in my tent to some chemical off-gassing from the fabric, intensified by the sun.

I could chalk up the weird quiet in the forest to weather and bad timing.

I could even, if I really stretched, chalk up the impossible, repeating trees and the shifting time to some kind of neurological event. A seizure, maybe. A small stroke. People lose time in all kinds of ways.

I can’t explain what’s been happening with doors since I got home.

The first night back in my apartment, I couldn’t bring myself to close my bedroom door. It sounds stupid written out like this. I’d never been weird about that before. But the idea of shutting it all the way, of having that flat panel of wood between me and the hallway, made my skin crawl.

I left it cracked. Just an inch.

At three in the morning, I woke up because it was fully closed.

I live alone.

I told myself I must have gotten up half-asleep and closed it. That’s normal, right? Sleepwalking, half-dreaming, adjusting things and forgetting. Brains are weird.

The next night, I wedged an old running shoe in the gap so it physically couldn’t swing shut on its own.

I woke to a soft click.

The shoe was on my side of the threshold, pushed back into the room. The door was closed. The knob felt cool under my hand.

I don’t know why I did what I did next. Maybe I was tired of feeling like prey. Maybe some stupid part of me thought if I called its bluff, whatever was happening would stop.

I turned the knob and pulled the door open fast.

The hallway was there.

The cheap runner rug. The scuffed walls. The faint glow from the streetlight bleeding in around the edges of the blinds in the living room.

But for just a heartbeat, in the moment before my eyes adjusted, I smelled pine needles and cold water and that faint, stale room air.

Then it was gone, and the door swung back against the stop with a hollow thud.

I’ve started noticing other things.

Office doors clicking shut behind me when no one else is around.

Elevator doors taking a beat too long to open, the air on the other side just a little warmer than the lobby.

Once, in the grocery store, every freezer door in the frozen aisle fogged over at the same time, and behind the frost I thought I saw a shape lean close, like a face pressed against glass.

I blinked and it was just my reflection, warped by the curve of the plastic. That’s what I decided, anyway. It was easier.

⸻

I know what the rational advice is.

Go see a neurologist. Get a psych eval. Have someone check for leaks in the building, mold, carbon monoxide. Rule out all the real-world monsters before you start inventing new ones.

I’m trying. I really am.

But there’s something I haven’t told anyone offline, because saying it out loud to a doctor means I’ll see that flicker in their eyes, that little note added to my chart.

The ranger kept the original trail register sheet. My copy is just that, a copy. I’ve looked at it a hundred times, trying to convince myself the word “Door” looks different than the rest of the handwriting.

Last night, I pulled it out again.

The letters have changed.

They’re straighter now, neater, like they’ve been practicing. The ink is still grey photocopy ink. That hasn’t changed. But the shape of the D, the curve of the o, the angle of the r—they match my handwriting exactly now. Not the shaky version I saw in the hospital. My regular, everyday writing.

I didn’t scream, but only because I didn’t have any air left. I just sat there with the paper in my hands for a long time and realized my fingers were shaking so hard the edges were crumpling.

Underneath, in smaller letters I swear weren’t there before, is a new line.

“Next time, knock.”

It’s the same faded grey as the rest, like it was always there.

I checked the back of the paper just to make sure it wasn’t bleeding through from something else. It’s blank.

I don’t know what to do with that except write this down here and hope that putting it into words pins it down, keeps it from shifting any further.

If you camp, if you hike, if you go looking for places that most people never see, just… pay attention.

If you find a trail that’s too straight, in a place it shouldn’t be.

If you feel the forest lean in.

If you ever, ever see a perfectly normal door standing by itself between the trees, I want you to remember what I am telling you now:

You do not want to know how long it has been waiting for you to open it.
