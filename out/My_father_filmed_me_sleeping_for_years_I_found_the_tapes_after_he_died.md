I stopped at the doorway of my father's small unkempt home, my hand grasping the door frame. I stood there for a second, hesitating, before walking inside. He'd lived there for a few years before he died, but I'd only been inside the house a handful of times. The damp smell hit me as soon as I crossed the threshold. A solitary recliner sat in the corner of the living room. A TV guide perched on the arm. The place where I remembered him the most. In front of the TV watching old shows, replying only in grunts when I spoke to him.

The room was sparse: bare walls, not a photo in sight. I stood in the center of the room and sighed. I made my way to the narrow staircase and up to the single bedroom. The blanket was strewn across the bed. It revealed the stained sheets that lay underneath. I tried my best not to think about what the stains might have been.

As I opened the closet, a box fell out and landed on my feet. I winced in pain and cursed my father under his breath. I looked inside the box. There were old family photos. Me, my mother, father, and brother all stood together at the beach, beaming smiles on our faces. A small smile crept across my lips before I put the photo back.

There were old awards from my father's boxing days, medals from his time in the military, and a pocket knife. I tossed them to one side. I wasn't interested in keeping them. I wasn't particularly interested in keeping anything. I had wanted my brother Paul to come and help empty out the house, but he was in the Bahamas with his fiancé for the next two weeks.

As I was going through the heaps of useless items my father had collected over the years, I spotted a large box at the back. The writing on it read 'Home Movies'. I raised my eyebrows. I could barely remember my father filming anything. I grabbed the box and looked inside. There were a dozen tapes labeled: Paul's Birthday, Christmas 1989, Beach Day, among others. I picked up the box and headed back downstairs. My father still had a VCR player tucked underneath the TV.

I put the tape in, pressed play, and sank into my father's armchair. The grainy film started playing. My father filmed my mother and brother playing around, splashing each other in the sea. The camera eventually spun around to reveal my father sat next to me. I looked around five or six. I had never seen this before. I had a beaming smile on my face. My mother died a few years ago. Seeing her face again made me feel warm inside. The tape was only a few minutes long. I rummaged through the box again, longing to see my mother's face for a few moments more. I decided on Christmas 1989.

The film started with Paul opening his presents, his eyes lighting up at the toys my parents had bought him. My mother sat just in frame on the right-hand side. She was watching joyously as her eldest child reacted. I ran into the frame.

"My turn. My turn," I said, jumping up and down. As soon as I came into the frame, my father flipped the camera round. His face filled the screen. He smiled. A wide smile. I couldn't quite tell what, but something was off. My father's smile reached just a little too far. The camera lingered on his face for a moment before the tape ended. I sat there staring at the blank screen for a minute. That smile. I'd never seen it before.

I shook it off. Told myself I was being ridiculous. It was just a smile. I decided to get on with cleaning out the rest of the house. After a few hours, I was satisfied that I had cleared out everything. There was a neat stack of boxes by the front door. I wiped the sweat off my brow and took one last look around. The box of tapes still sat next to the armchair.
Why not watch one more before throwing them all away, I thought. I looked through the box and found a few tapes with dates written on them. Nothing else. Just dates. I was intrigued. 

I pulled out one that said '18.06.95' and placed it in the VCR. The tape started playing. It was just a black screen. I could hear someone's quiet breathing behind the camera. This went on for a few seconds as I watched in confusion. Suddenly, the person behind the camera moved forwards and what looked like a bed came into frame. They moved the camera up, revealing a teenage boy asleep in bed. I sat up. It was me. The camera stayed on me for a minute, just watching me sleep. I didn't move. I could hear my own breathing now, too loud in the empty house. I grabbed the tape out of the VCR and held it, staring at it.

I placed it carefully back in the box and pulled out another tape: '20.03.96'. I forced it into the VCR, almost like I wanted it to break. I stood this time, alert, on edge. The tape began on me. I was sleeping again. It lingered on me for a moment. Someone picked the camera up and closed in on me. My face filled the screen. The tape cut off. I grabbed onto the TV, steadying myself. This was just a nice thing my father had done. Lots of parents watch their kids sleep. My father just decided to record it. There was nothing wrong with that. Right?

I paced around the room, thoughts swirling in my head. I pulled out my phone and called my brother Paul. We exchanged pleasantries. Paul told me how his trip to the Bahamas was going. How I should join them when they go next year. I patiently listened, but in my head I was screaming for him to shut the hell up so I could speak. He finally stopped talking. That was usually the cue to end the phone call, but I needed to ask him something.
"Hey, do you ever remember Dad filming us when we were kids?" I asked.

Paul didn't say anything for a moment. "Um, yeah. Yeah, I think so. He used to film us at Christmas and birthdays. I think that was when you were pretty young though." I stayed silent.

Paul spoke again. "Why do you ask anyway?" I froze. Should I tell my brother?

I hesitated and then answered. "No reason really. I just found some tapes in his closet. One of your birthdays was on there. It was nice seeing Mom again." That started us off on a trip down memory lane, reminiscing about our childhood and our trips to the beach with our mother. My tensed shoulders had relaxed all of a sudden and I had a smile on my face. Paul asked a question.

"Did you see any tapes of your birthdays?" I paused and thought for a moment. All the tapes with labels had said Paul's name. None of them said mine.
"No, there wasn't actually. Maybe they're in another box or something," I replied.

Paul cleared his throat. "Well, he did always seem a bit distant towards you now that I think about it." I thought for a minute. All the times that my father had asked Paul if he wanted to throw the ball around outside and never me.
I remembered a time when I was a young boy. My father had just gotten home from work. The two of us had run up to him. My father picked Paul up and gave him a hug. 

He just ruffled my hair. My father said he was taking us for ice cream. We hopped in the car and drove over to the ice cream parlour a few miles away. As we drove, my father asked both of us how we were getting on at school. Paul was always the smarter one; he got straight A's all throughout school. I, on the other hand, was dyslexic and struggled in school. My father knew that, but it didn't seem to matter. Paul told him how he was getting on, which put a smile on my father's face, but when I told him, he frowned and shook his head. He berated me, told me I was useless and that I didn't deserve ice cream. While Paul and my father ate ice cream and laughed, I watched on from the back seat of the car in tears.

"Listen, I gotta go, Paul. There's a lot to do here and I need to get on with it." My brother seemed slightly taken aback at the abrupt end to the phone call, but we said our goodbyes and I hung up. All of a sudden, I was very aware I was alone in the house. The box of tapes seemed to look bigger now. Something was drawing me to them.

I pulled a tape out at random: '17.09.96'. I slotted it in the VCR and sat down in the armchair. The tape started the same as it had in the previous one, watching me sleep. I could feel my skin crawl as I fidgeted in the chair.

 Something about the tapes just seemed deeply unsettling. The quiet breathing. The stillness of it all. Me in my most vulnerable moment. In the corner of the frame, something moved. I sat up and looked closer. I could just about make out a shadowy figure in the corner of the room. I moved even closer to the TV.

I couldn't quite make out what I was seeing. I paused the tape and stared at the figure. As I inspected it closer, I could tell it was a man standing in the corner, dressed in all black. His face was covered by a mask, a black mask, with a crudely painted white smile on it. 

I froze, transfixed by the masked man. I pulled out another tape. Played it. The same masked man stood in the corner. I grabbed another. And another. Every tape, the figure was there. Standing. Watching. I knew it in my heart before my mind caught up. The posture. The height. The way he held his shoulders. It was unmistakable. My father, masked, watching me sleep. Night after night.

I sat back down, my legs unable to keep me upright. I rocked back and forth in the chair, head in my hands. Suddenly, I jolted up. I searched the place looking for answers, anything that could explain it. The kitchen.

The bathroom. The bedroom. Everywhere. I arrived back at the closet. I looked inside. I noticed a small divot towards the back. I hadn't noticed before, but now that it was cleaned out, it was obvious. I pulled at the divot and a cutout of the wall started to come off. I hesitated. Did I really want to see what was on the other side? But I had to know. I ripped the cutout off the wall. Another box sat in the hiding place.

I opened up the box. More tapes. I picked one up: '20.10.2011'. I swallowed hard. My chest tightened. I could barely breathe. Grabbing the box, I hurried back downstairs and inserted the tape. I stood only inches away from the screen. The tape began as normal in a bedroom. But this wasn't my childhood bedroom. 

No, as I studied it closer, I realized this was my old apartment. I'd moved out years ago at this point. My father stood in the corner in the same mask. Watching me sleep. My skin prickled. I could feel the goosebumps on my arms. I felt the urge to look away, but I couldn't. How did my father get in my apartment? I could barely think straight. Too many thoughts were going through my mind.

The spare key. I'd given my father a key when I moved out for emergencies. Instead, it had been used to watch me. Was this control? Obsession? Only my father could answer that, and it was too late to ask.

I dug into the box, checking the date on every single one of the mountain of tapes. They went on for years. I stopped for a second when I found one single tape that stood out. It was dated six months ago. My father had been doing this right up until he was in the hospital. I tentatively put it into the VCR. It was my new apartment. I watched for a moment, about to turn it off. But my father moved. He took off the mask and held it in his hands.

I watched closely and inspected my father's face. He was crying. Tears streamed down my father's face as he watched me sleep. I watched my father fall to his knees and silently weep, looking at me. The tape ended abruptly.
The house was silent. So silent that I realized I'd been holding my breath. I let out a deep sigh. I didn't stay. I grabbed the boxes from by the door and hurriedly chucked them into my car. I grabbed the tapes last and placed them on the back seat. 

As I was driving, I constantly checked my mirrors and the backseat. I couldn't shake the feeling that somehow I was being watched. I made my way over to the dump, about a twenty-minute drive from my father's house.

I grabbed the box of tapes from the back seat and walked up to the top. I stood looking out at the dump, only the concrete barrier in my way. I looked down at the tapes. I lingered on them for a moment before throwing the box and watching it crash down on the pile of trash below. I could see the clouds of icy breath fall out of my mouth as I breathed heavily.

I arrived back at my apartment shortly after. I checked my locks twice and sat down. I called a locksmith and arranged for him to come over the next morning to change my front door locks. There was no reason for me to feel unsafe now. My father was dead. But it just felt right. I walked over to my bedroom to change, but found myself stuck in the doorway, staring at the spot my father had stood in so many times before. I imagined him standing there, just watching me. A shiver ran down my spine.

Later that night, I lay on the floor of my bedroom looking up at the ceiling. I had tried to go to sleep, but it didn't feel right lying in the bed. I felt like I was being watched. I turned to my side to put my hand on the mattress to get up when I noticed something tucked underneath my bed. I stretched my arm out and grabbed it. The mask. The mask that had seen so much of me over the years. I studied it. I had the feeling that it was looking back at me. I should throw it away. I should burn it like I should have burned the tapes. I didn't move. I just held it, the painted smile facing me in the dark.

I'm writing this because I still haven't been able to sleep. It's been three days. Every time I close my eyes, I see that smile. That painted smile watching me in the corner of every room I've ever slept in.

The locksmith came this morning. New locks. New keys. No one has a spare this time.

But the mask is still here. It's sitting on my kitchen table right now. I keep telling myself to throw it away. Burn it. Do something. But I can't. I don't know why.

My father never told me he loved me. Not once in thirty-two years. But he drove to my apartment in the middle of the night, for years, just to watch me sleep. And in the end, he wept.

I don't know what that means. I don't think I ever will.
The mask is still watching me. And some part of me thinks I deserve to know what it felt like.
