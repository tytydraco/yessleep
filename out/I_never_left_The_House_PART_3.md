Yesterday, after posting the last part, Ava finally finished her shower. She got out and looked at me. She looked a bit embarrassed, or shy, I’m not sure, I’m not used to this, I usually only interact with Peter. Now that I knew that she could talk, I wanted to ask her so many questions, but she was clearly still scared, so I decided to take it slow. We had to eat, but first, I had to get my shots. We went to the check-up room, and I injected two in my arm. Now I only had 46 shots left. This got me anxious, so I decided to get back to the usual 1 shot in the morning and 1 shot in the evening. They only started to give us two doses a few days earlier, and this could double the time that my stock would last.

 

We went to the dining room, I took out cornflakes and milk, and we ate in silence. After that moment, I thought it could be time to start questioning Ava. I started by asking if I could ask her a few things, and she nodded yes. I didn’t really know where to start, so I just asked her who she was, to which she answered “Ava” again. I then asked where she was from, but she didn’t remember. I told her to tell me anything she remembered from before we met. She only mumbled a few words: “screams, pein, fear, monster, Adam,…” and when I asked her what this all meant, she said that she didn’t know. Clearly, I wasn’t gonna go far with her, at least for that moment, especially when I asked her if she had any explanation for what happened last night, and that she said that she was sorry, but that she just knew that she acted weird. I told her to finish eating, and that after she could go in the computer room if she wanted.

 

I went back to check what all of you were telling me. Thanks to everyone for your help. So, apparently, according to my file, I have focal epilepsy, and one of you told me that this is what caused me to black out that night. The Keppra is supposed to prevent these events to happen, so you suggested me to go see if I could find anything in the check-up room that was labeled “Keppra”.

 

The line that said that I was suffering from delusional disorder apparently suggest that I could have a hard time telling the difference between reality and my imagination. That really scares me to be honest. The file said that it was under control, but there were no more details in that part. To answer a question I got, the syringes are not labeled at all.

 

After reading, I immediately went to the check-up room. I looked everywhere for something that said Keppra and ended up finding a pretty large stock of pill that was labeled as that. I immediately ingested one pill. I don’t know if that matches the 1500 mg that my file mentioned, but I didn’t want to take the risks of taking too much. I remembered that my file also said that I was treated with anti-psychotics, but I couldn’t find anything labeled as that, there were a whole lot of other pills with different names, but I didn’t know what they were.

 

After that, I decided that it was time to go back to my reading. Yesterday, I only read two pages, being the first pages of both my and Peter’s file. I went to the office where I started. For that, I had to pass through the hallway. All the blood was dry, and it looked more brown than red now. I tried not to look to much at it and entered the office. I took out the pages that I read the day before. As I reminder, here’s a copy paste of the first page of my file that I already posted in the last part:

 

*Profile File - Subject 1: Lucija*

*Birth Date: 04/06/2005 – Female*

*Mother: 027 – Father: 009*

*Location House 1 (2 shots/day)*

 

*Known Diseases/Health Issues:*

*Focal Epilepsy (07/08/2009)*

*Bee Allergy*

 

*Mental Issues:*

*Subject 1 seems to show signs of paranoia as well as delusional disorder (see “February 2010 Incidents Reports” file) (02/16/2010)*

*-> under control (11/25/2010)*

 

*Treatments:*

*Keppra: 1500 mg/day*

*Anti-psychotics (see “Treatments details” file)*

 

*Biological Urges: controlled (see “August 2020 Incident Reports” file and “Biological Urges S.1” file)*

 

 

I didn’t know where to start. This was just one drawer, but it was full of files, and the rest of the office was full of other bigger shelves and drawers. I decided to start to look for a file that seemed interesting: Incidents Reports. In my page, where it said that I suffered of delusional disorder and paranoia, it also said: “*see “February 2010 Incidents Reports” file”.*

 

If I was correct, this was supposed to be a report of every significant event that happened, so I could use it to understand what was the meaning of, well, me.

 

I looked in the drawer where my file was, but it was thousands of pages of information about us. Not that it’s not interesting, but the quantity confused me. I opened a few other drawers, before finding one that said “Incidents Reports”. I instinctively took the first binder and opened it. Here’s what was written…

 

*APRIL 2005*

*04/21:*

*- Subject 1 and Subject 2 enters House 1.*

*- First injections -> No physical/psychological changes.*

*Report of the day: Both subjects cry when alone in the yard. No reaction to outside watchers.*  
  
*04/23:*

*- First changes probably from injections effects: Both subjects already took their first steps after less than a month of life.*

*Report of the day: No reaction to outside watchers.*

 

The rest of the pages were kind of the same, nothing interesting was written, so I decided to jump straight to the part that lit my interest: February 2010. I had to skip a few drawers before finding the file. I looked through it and finally found the part that I was searching. Here’s what it said…

 

*02/16:*

*- Subject 1 reacts aggressively to doctors during check-up. Subject’s statement: “They put insects in my arm, and they are in my skin. They want that I don’t do what I want.”.*

*- Subject 1 refuses to eat breakfast and pushes Subject 2 to do the same thing. Subject’s statement (alleged): “There is bad water in the food, and it hurts.” Both subjects ate when presented with a different type of food.*

*- Subject 1 reacts negatively to outside watchers. No relation with injection’s expected reactions. Subject 1 tries to harm outside watchers.*

*Report of the day: Subject 1 shows very worrying symptoms that could make her a danger to Subject 2 and herself. She will be under a very tight surveillance from now on.*

 

*02/17:*

*- Subject 1 is not sleeping and looks around the room constantly.*

*- Subject 1 scratches her legs and arms at 1AM until they bleed. Intervention needed. Subject’s statement: “The insects are in my skin, I want no.”*

*- Subject 1 is exceptionally injected with analgesics and sedatives.*

*Doctor’s note: I am entirely aware of the reductive effect that the morphine and sedative that I decided to treat the subject with can have on the experiment and I take the entire responsibility of that choice. After considering the situation, I decided that it would be better to prevent the subject from death, even if that meant retarding the effects of the experiment.*

*- Subject 2 states that he’s scared of subject 1.*

*-Subject 1 stays calm for the day.*

*Report of the day: Subject 1 symptoms are becoming more worrying. A psychiatrist has been called and will observe the subject in the next few days or weeks.*

 

*02/18*

*- Subject 1 refuses her injection in the morning and attacks the doctors responsible of the check-up. Injection had to be forced.*

*- Subject 1 states that she and Subject 2 are being surveilled by the personal but doesn’t seem to have notice the cameras, possible signs of paranoia.*

*- Subject 1 hides from the outside watchers in the yard all day.*

*- Subject 2 seems to show an urge to approach the outside watchers, possible first occurrence of the effects of the injections.*

*- Subject 1 refuses to sleep. She falls asleep at 11PM.*

*Report of the day: Subject 1 continues to show worrying symptoms that could be an obstacle to the experiment. Subject 2 may show the first signs of an effect from the injections, besides the physical effects already present in both subjects.*

*Psychiatrist’s notes: Subject 1 is clearly showing symptoms of a serious delusional disorder, that could escalate to dangerous levels. I recommended to start a treatment of anti-psychotics that would be put in her food. That treatment should decrease the growing effects of the disorder.*

 

*02/19:*

*- Subject 1 refuses to get her injection again. Injection had to be forced.*

*- Subject 1 states that she sees birds in the dining room.*

*- Subject 1 mistakes Subject 2 for a doctor during breakfast and talks with him like it.*

*- Subject 1 states that she sees the sky going red, and people playing soccer in the yard.*

*- Subject 1 refuses to eat. She eats when presented with another meal.*

*Report of the day: Subject 1 now shows other more worrying symptoms. Subject 2 shows no more urge to go to the outside watchers.*

*Psychiatrist’s notes: Subject 1 seems to now show symptoms of a pretty severe schizophrenia. These should also decrease with the anti-psychotic treatment that I now changed according to these new events.*

 

The days that followed were similar to these, with a slight decrease of the events. I decided to jump straight to December 2010. According to my file, that’s when my disorder was officially under control. I went to the date that was indicated in my file.

 

*11/25:*

*- Subject 2 has trouble waking up*

*Report of the day: After 3 entire months without signs of her disorders, we conclude that Subject 1 delusional disorder, paranoia and schizophrenia are under control and that the current treatment is working. It will be adapted to her weight from now on.*

 

So that was it. Reading all this really disturbed me. I didn’t remember any of it, nothing. And knowing that these kinds of things happened to me. I couldn’t believe that this was me that they were talking about. I surprised myself to cry a little. I also realized that I really missed Peter.

 

After taking a moment to recover from this, I tried to look for the latest report, maybe it will say what happened the last week, and I could understand everything. Unfortunately, the last report was from 10 days ago, and it didn’t say anything important.

 

Like some of you advised me to, I looked for Ava’s file. At first, I searched for it in the drawer where I found mine and Peter’s, but as I said before, it was filled with other information about us. I then tried to open some other shelves. At some point, I opened one that caught my eyes. It was less organized than the rest, and one binder looked different. I took it out and opened it. It was full of colorful drawings, some were saying happy birthday, a lot said “Happy Father’s Day”. I didn’t completely understand what this meant exactly, but I don’t think that was useful to me. I opened a few other drawers, before I found one that was labeled on the inside: “Houses”. It immediately caught my eyes. On a lot of documents, it was stated that Peter and I were located in “House 1”, and that drawer confirmed that there were probably other Houses, with other “subjects” like us. If I could find information about Ava, it was there.

 

There were title cards dividing the files. It went from “House 2” to “House 10”. I opened them one by one. Each started with 2 first pages, being profile pages, like the one I found for Peter and I. As I went through these, I saw multiple names. Eventually, I arrived at House 8, and that’s where I found Ava’s profile, followed by the one of a boy named Adam. Here’s her’s.

 

*Profile File - Subject 16: Ava*

*Birth Date: 08/22/2005 – Female*

*Mother: 040 – Father: 007*

*Location House 8 (9 shots/day)*

 

*Known Diseases/Health Issues:*

*NONE*

 

*Mental Issues:*

*Subject 16 seems to show signs of depression (see “January 2017 Incidents Reports” file) (01/13/2017)*

 

*Treatments:*

*Antidepressant Medication*

 

*Biological Urges: controlled (see “July 2019 Incident Reports” file and “Biological Urges S.16” file)*

 

*Aging Stopped 2012*

 

Now, this was a very disturbing profile. Since then, I thought Ava was something around 8 years old, but according to her file, she was actually 18 years old, but she looked nothing like it. It also said that she received 9 injections each day. I still have no idea what was actually in those syringes, but I only ever got 2 shots a day, except the last week, when it went to 4. I took a quick look at all 18 profiles, and the last two subjects, those in House 10, apparently had 12 shots a day, which sounded huge. I couldn’t believe what I was reading. Knowing that I wasn’t alone to have lived this life was nice, but I had no idea what happened to them.

 

I tried to look if I could find other House’s incident reports but didn’t find anything. They’re probably in their houses, wherever they are, or maybe I can find copies in one of the other office. I decided to continue to take it one step at a time and to finish inspecting that office first.

 

I continued to look in other cabinet. I opened one and found myself in front of a file that had two pictures on the first page that I recognized in a second: it was Tyler and Debbie. I took it and opened it. Again, I think it’s simpler to rewrite you what was in it.

 

*HOUSE 1 - TEST NAME: TYLER AND DEBBIE*

 

*Mr. Madsen and Ms. Asknes are portraying Tyler and Debbie for this new component of the experiment.*

 

*Process:*

*Tyler and Debbie are the new main social contact of Subject 1 and 2 besides each other. They need to build a relationship with the subjects. They are serving the food, leading the subjects from one room to another, and once a week, they spend the day in the yard with the subjects.*

 

*Goal:*

*We need to see how the subjects will react to humans in their close environment other than outside watchers. We believe that the physical and emotional proximity may give us different reactions from the subjects and trigger their urge further than the few hints that we got so far from them.*

 

Again, having to read this was a lot. I really liked Tyler and Debbie, and apparently, they were part of some sort of test. But still, they’re the ones that warned us about that place and that bad things were going to happen.  
  
After that first page. I decided that it was enough for that day. I had been reading for a moment, and I didn’t even check on Ava. Before leaving, I tried to use the office computer as some said I should, but it asked a password, which I don’t entirely understand.  
  
I got up and, suddenly, I was facing myself. Just in front of me, standing, it was me, or should I say, something that looked exactly like me. I was petrified. I didn’t know what to do. It smiled to me and started to speak. “You’re lonely, aren’t you?” it said. “Come on, follow me, I know where to find Peter.” it continued. It started to walk and I followed it, but it stopped pretty fast. That thing turned back to me. “Or maybe you could just die. You wouldn’t be alone” it said. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. In a second, that thing jumped on me and we fell on the floor. It was on top of me, and it started to punch me, laughing. I was trying to protect myself but couldn’t. It then started to scratch my face with its nails. It was painful and I put my hands on my face to protect me. I couldn’t see because of it. A few seconds later, I heard it laughing one last time, and then, silence. I carefully removed my hands from my face and there was nothing there anymore.

 

I got up and looked at my face in a glass. It was bleeding from wounds on my cheeks, and my hands were covered in blood, probably because I put them on my face. I ran out of the office. There was something dangerous in here that was taking my form and I had left Ava alone. I arrived in the computer room and found her on the couch, reading a book. I asked her if she saw anything looking like me. I was panicked. She said no, but looked really concerned by the wounds on my face. As she watched them she took a few steps back and her breathe got faster. She looked scared. I slowly approached her to see if everything was fine, but she screamed at me to stay back. She then did what she did the night before, and bit her arm very hard and deep. Blood was flooding from it and she was crying. This time, Ava was clearly entirely conscious and awake. She stopped and screamed, a scream of fear and despair.

 

She used her nails and started to peel off her leg’s skin. It was an awful vision, and I was petrified. She then proceeded to take her skin and put it in her mouth. She closed it and looked right at me with a face of fear and disgust as she was chewing on it. After maybe a minute, she looked calmer, and she had nothing in her mouth anymore. I went to grab anything I could find in the check-up room and brought it back. I covered her wounds with bandages. I saw doctors do it to Peter once, so I did as I remembered. After I finished, Ava made me sign that I should do the same with my face, which I did.

 

We sat there in silence for a moment. We were both recovering. That’s when I heard something, a scream. I recognized the voice, it was Peter, he was screaming my name. The sound came from the yard. I was so happy to hear him. I told Ava that it was my friend who was calling. She looked a bit weirded out. I grabbed her and went to the yard, but when I arrived, the screams stopped. I looked everywhere but there was no one. I asked Ava if she saw him. She succeeded to talk and told me that she didn’t even hear anything. I think she was still recovering from the choc and didn’t noticed it.

 

We went back inside. I was seriously disappointed, but at least I knew he was somewhere nearby. We went to eat, and both ate a lot. After that, I told her to sleep. We went to the computer room, and I decided to stay awake to protect her. I wasn’t going to sleep knowing that there was someone pretending to be me that could attack her at any moment. I almost forgot to get my shot so I went to do it fast and came back.

 

During the night, I tried to look on the computer for some names of antidepressant medications. I knew from her file that she was treated with it, and maybe some of the pills in the check-up room that have names that I don’t know are antidepressants. Unfortunately, the computer refused to let me do that research. The person who said that my internet access was heavily restricted was right apparently. I’m getting very worried for Ava, so if some of you could look for names of antidepressant medications, it would help a lot.  
  
I managed to stay awake for maybe 3 more hours, but I ended up falling asleep. I woke up today very early. Ava is still sleeping, and I decided to take the time to write you this before the day really starts.

 

I know there’s a lot of new information in this post, I myself am completely lost in all this. If you have any theories, advices, questions, ideas, anything, I beg you, tell me everything. I really need help. I’ll keep you [updated.](https://www.reddit.com/user/markimdreaming/comments/1c1gwgd/full_universe_timeline/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
