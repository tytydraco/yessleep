A woman’s hazy vision shifts into focus. It didn’t feel like waking up, she realized, confused. It was like coming out of a blackout, initiated by day drinking or an overdone dose of her pills. It was a feeling she knew all too well. The first thing she noticed was the ground. She was standing on what looked like mud. She winced in disgust. She was wearing her brand new Louboutins after all. Then her mind sharpened and saw that a man was standing in front of her facing away from her. She looked over at the heels of his destroyed suede shoes and peered up slowly. A sharp panic set in as she noticed that she could only move her head. She was standing on her feet facing the back of the man, but she felt frozen, unable to move a single muscle below her neck. She looked around and finally took stock of her surroundings. The man in front of her wore a crisp, navy suit. It was perfectly tailored but had dark stains all over with gashes interspersed around the middle of his back. Her mind faltered, unable to comprehend it, and turned to her right and then her left, looking towards the main sources of light. Her eyes widened. On the edges of their path there was not a lamp or a torch, but fire itself, and it licked up through the slimy soil as if fueled by the mud itself with no source of oil or wood in sight. She stared mesmerized for a moment then focused on what she could see beyond the smokeless flames.

It was nothing. An impossibly vast and cavernous space of pitch-black nothingness. Like the deep reaches of space and the bottom of the ocean, it was a secret. It could just be dark, but it was a darkness that held an overpowering mystery. She suddenly knew to look away in fear. She could sense the darkness was impossible but also feared what lay beyond it. There was a presence. It was a brand-new sense that overpowered her sight and became an unsettling sensation that she had never felt before. She knew she was being watched. Closely. She instinctively looked back down at her feet and noticed that she was raising her right foot. She watched, horrified, as her body marched forward three steps, each step digging her sparkling shoes into the mud deeper and deeper. The mud itself held a strange hue, which was a near black mix of red and brown. It appeared stable and firm but would give way like a sickly crème brulee with each step. She heard whimpering coming from behind her. It was a young man.

“*I’m not supposed to be here. I’m not supposed to be here. I’m not supposed to be here. I’m not supposed to be here…*” The young man mumbled to himself in between high-pitched sobs.

“*Shhh*, I don’t think we’re supposed to talk,” the woman whispered. She was still afraid of the feeling which she could not shake.

“You can hear me?! Please! You have to help me! I can’t move, it’s like I’m paralyzed. It’s my birthday today! I can’t be here!” He was hysterical. The woman frowned and looked at the ground again trying to become as innocent-looking as possible. Suddenly there was a thunderous chorus of groans. It was millions of words layered over each other which scrambled in the air and vibrated painfully through the woman’s body. This went on for hours. And then days. The woman stood dazed in and out of lucidity. Occasionally she was forced to march onwards, all while experiencing a constant pain which intensified in unpredictable waves. From that moment onward she realized where she was and ruminated every conscious moment on why she was there.

She had had the perfect life. She had never wanted for a single thing. Actually, she had wanted a great deal of things, but they somehow always ended up hers. That was the privilege of her family’s reputation and vast fortune. She had lived a half-life of leisure, and never knew the powerless feeling of serving others. She had done what she wanted and when she wanted, right up to the very end, but it was really over. The lack of hardship made her yearn for it inexplicably, and she overindulged in toxic substances. She didn’t know what she was searching for. She couldn’t know, and now she never would.

When, the screaming finally subdued, the woman still felt no relief. The marching was constant, and the oppressive darkness infinite. Every once in a while, she could sense movement just beyond the flames, but she didn’t dare look. Instead, she watched her feet as they moved all on their own in monotony, feeling powerless for the first time ever. After what felt like weeks, and encouraged by faint whispers, she mustered up the courage to speak again.

“Where are we going?” she whispered slowly and carefully, not really expecting an answer.

“To be forgotten. Forever.” The old man in front of her let out meekly. The woman eager to know more continued feverishly.

“Forgotten? But why are we here? I shouldn’t be here. What did you do?” the woman, unable to contain herself, whispered back desperately, waiting for an answer. 

“Nothing. I had grandkids. I am a good man. What about you? You are surely a sinner?” The man asked slowly with an increasing hint of anger behind his words.

“I’m not even 50 yet. You got to live your whole life. I wasn’t perfect, but I’m not a bad person,” she pleaded breathlessly.

“I’m the bad person.” The woman suddenly heard from behind her. “I think I killed someone. I was driving. My dad had just bought me a car for my birthday. I took it out for a drive. I lost control, but my life hadn’t even started…” The woman could sense that the young man was starting to lose it once more.

“*Shhhh*. You can’t be that bad if I’m here too. I haven’t done anything,” The woman attempted to calm him, but the overwhelming fatigue of the march consumed her and she became catatonic once more. Several more days passed. A whisper from the old man nudged her back to consciousness.

“There are kids here! Completely innocent people who have done nothing,” He whispered with furious disbelief.

“Surely some have to be murderers or violators?” The woman asked back exhausted but unable to rest.

“The whispers say that there is some, but not all.” He replied.

The woman unsure of what to make of this development, peered over to the edge of the flames. Then back at the old man in front of her. She looked closely at his tan loafers which were now starting to disintegrate before her very eyes.

“Are those Gucci?” she almost laughed as she said it, but no sound escaped.

“What?” the man asked back confused.

“Your shoes.” She stated back as if it mattered.

“Yeah probably. I don’t know. Who cares now?” He dismissed.

“My jacket is Gucci,” she whispered mostly to herself. Although her body stayed in a prison-like rigidity, she could still feel every sensation, including the thick heavy coat on her shoulders which now held no warmth. She looked down to examine it more closely, and realized it was now sprayed with the wet, crumbling mud. It had also begun to disintegrate. The corrosive mud had singed the once shining fabric and a heavy musk hung in the air. The oppressive freeze grew in intensity, while the taunting flames danced just out of reach. Although inevitable, the woman constantly lamented her end and yet she marched on in abject misery.

Before long, the young man from behind carried whisperers up to the woman and the old man. The innocent were indeed standing throughout the line and they all seemed to share one common trait. They were ridiculously wealthy. They were the sons and daughters of the world’s wealthiest elite. Their families had held control in the world for generations, snowballing them into country-rivaling economies. And they were all doomed to hell. By now, the woman had been marching in line for what felt like years.

When decades had rolled around, the woman and her somber companions heard a new, horrifying whisper. It had finally made its way down from the front of the line. By this point, the woman’s clothes were in tatters and ragged from wear. She could feel her fine clothing start to slowly fall away. The old man’s shirt also deteriorated, and the wounds on his back were revealed at last. She chose to stare at her bare feet instead as she took in the message. The woman was obligated to take another step, and an incredible pain pulsed through her body as she listened. Sensing a movement in the darkness sent a flash of fear through her naked body as she marched through the flames.

“It isn’t mud we walk on. It’s the blood, sweat, and tears of those we used to get our way. We are cursed to march as they did. Forced to feel the pain they felt. Forced to be forgotten and once we finish our march, we will become nothing.” The message was clear, and yet the woman absorbed it as if she had walked horizontally into a still body of icy water. The feeling pressed in on her head giving her a blinding pain she had never felt before, it was shame. She was a victim. No, she felt like a victim, and she was, but of greed.

“But why us?” The woman pleaded once more, and stinging acid tears began to pour down her face.

“Because we did nothing.” he replied shortly. “Because greed always had its price”
