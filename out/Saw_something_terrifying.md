On a camping trip with friends in the backwoods of southern Georgia, at my cousins grandfather's property. Really old site, he didn't maintain it well. There was a large cabin/meeting house, lots of property, a lake and a large wooded area that we liked to explore. There was a river that wound through the woods, and we built huge forts along it. We camped by the shore of the lake, it was low but on the opposite shore a huge ridge rose, with trees on either side. It reminded me of a carriage road. On our first night there, we stayed up until about 1. I needed to use the bathroom so I went to the meeting house, since we slept in tents. It was a wood paneled, ancient building full of animal heads. Dark, with few working lights. I stepped in, turned on the light and paused. The animal heads had all positioned to be facing the door. Unnerved, I used the restroom, stepped out only to find them looking right at me, on the other side of the room from where they were looking last. I ran out, terrified, then realized I hadn't turned off the light. I looked back, and was about to open the door to shut off the light when through the blinds, I saw a black, menacing figure in the corner of the room. this time the heads had swiveled to face it. Then, of it's own accord, the lights shut off. I ran to my tent and zipped myself up. I didn't sleep much that night. 

The next day we were exploring the woods and discoverd two places that, unbeknownst to us, would be the most terrifying places we had ever been later that night. We had built a fort along the river earlier that day, and we're following the river up when we came across a peculiar structure. A large triangular fort-like place made of what appeared to be tree roots, it was like a lean-to and was covered on the sides and top like a pyramid, but one side was slightly open like an entrance. Near the structure in an opposite triangle were three very deep holes, we were careful not to step in these. Inside the structure was a triangle-like object on the floor, made of what appeared to be finely whittled wood, very old, and covered in an unrecognizable, hieroglyph type writing. We chose not to disturb this. But to mark the spot and give us an observation point, we layed logs across a nearby ditch in a Vietnam style dugout and placed some large sticks with flags tied to them on top, so we could see the colors and know the spot. Then we found the ridge....

The ridge started deep in the woods almost parallel to our campsite, then wound to the lake and made up most of the opposite shore. We walked along it for about 15 minutes, and noticed that the path was like a tree tunnel, and the fallen leaves were well trodden, the path flat. Like a carriage trail. All of a sudden, we saw in the middle of the path an RV. Not just any RV, but an ancient RV from like the 60s like a van, we walked up and inspected it. It was filled with dust and the inside had obviously not seen daylight in years with prominent sun marks on the seats. And yet, the inside was full of large,  boxed packages and files. I tugged on the handle and tried to enter to my friends delight. The door gave way and I found a file sitting on the seat. It was very dusty so I slapped it against the dash and the dust fell away to reveal very faded letters. The only non faded or humidified characters were the large bold printed letters at the top. It read: "GA-SITE16, anomalous behavior detected, structures common, manifestation present, keep high alert level" I noticed the boxes and pulled one over, opening the lid. It had a bunch of the finely whittled sticks, a gooey, black substance in a jar, and what appeared to be an etched, polished metal sphere. The note in the box read, "station unsafe, will begin remote monitoring, situation still undefined, no further progress, holes still prevalent". I was very puzzled so I pulled over another paper lying on the seat, it seemed newer than the others, but still old, with a hole running along the edge, the decaying carcass of a bug lying stuck to the paper. I picked it up and read, "GA-SITE16, weekly instruction, inspect lake floor in direction Bravo, owner expected to arrive soon, be ready to stow equipment, another structure has appeared 0.6 miles away from your post direction 223. End"

I assumed the structures were referring to the wooden site, and that manifestation could refer either to weird occurrences or the black figure I had seen earlier. On our walk back, me and my friends felt like we were being watched, and I turned around to see a black figure dart behind a tree. We began to sprint and I kept seeing it in my periphery. However, later that day we were brainstorming what it might have been, and I realized that the neighbors breeded black labs, and that the figure I saw was probably one of his dogs chasing us. We went fishing that afternoon and I caught a large black eel, slick and eyeless, it had large teeth and tried to snap at my fingers. I threw it back terrified and it went back into the water. I discovered later that eels were not supposed to be living in that lake, and there appearance was unexpected. There was not a species nearby that matched what I had seen. That night we played manhunt and I went deep into the woods and hid with a friend in the dugout we built near the structure.

 About 10 minutes into hiding, (it's about 11:30) we saw a large black figure, about 10 feet in height rise from the structure and start walking slowly towards our dugout. It was a low to the ground dugout with a entereance in the front and the back. We sprinted out the back entrance and towards our tents. We turned and saw the creature sprinting after us, catching up quickly. Suddenly, the creature stopped and looked at the ridge like behind it at a very specific spot. It was a spot about 300 yards beyond the RV, suddenly, there was a muzzle flash from the ridge and the creature started getting pelted with rounds of some caliber. It screeched and began sprinting up the ridge, passing the RV in seconds. As it passed, the lights flickered on in the RV and then off again. The creature was beyond view in the darkness, but we heard screams of someone fat along the ridge. We slept inside the meeting house that night and a thunderstorm rolled in. I woke up about 4 am to see the creature standing about 10 yards away from the cabin windows, head obscured. I did a double take and it was gone. That morning, we took some knives and walked to where the screams came from the night before, we could see that the shots had come from what we now realized was the neighbors property. He stumbled over about 10 o clock the next day to say that he had shot at the creature, thinking it was gonna go after his dogs. He was a fervent conspiracy theorist and thought it was bigfoot. It had come after him and he went inside his house and hid in his upstairs. Later that day, we saw a fire coming from the ridge and saw that the structure had burned to a crisp. 

That night, we were sitting in the pickup truck bed and saw the RV turn on, and drive off the ridge into the lake. Before it hit the water, the water rose up as if to grab the RV and it was swallowed up. 
We freaked out, never camped there again
