*This is what I say to them.*



Wait. Just think for a moment.



I know someone who went through with this. Maybe twenty yards from the spot where you’re standing right now. He thought it was what he wanted, too. That it was what everyone around him wanted. In fact, he was convinced this was the only option left to him.



Right up until he jumped, he was certain. He felt relieved, even. Happier than he had been in months. But the moment his feet left solid ground, the panic — the terror — was immediate. He realised that all of his problems — problems that seemed insurmountable — were solvable. With the exception of one: that he was plummeting towards the bay at a hundred miles per hour.



He hit the water. It knocked the air out of him. He felt his body contort unnaturally. But he was alive. The adrenaline blinded him to the pain but he could tell his body felt all wrong. He swam with everything he had but his legs dragged behind him, lifeless. When he made it to the bank — finally — the pain and the exhaustion hit and he passed out.



He woke in a hospital. He was lucky, the doctors said — his crushed body was found maybe ten minutes after impact. But he wasn’t lucky. There was the pain — a pain that would always be there, now, every moment, debilitating, intolerable. And there were the years of physiotherapy out ahead of him — a brutal necessity if he ever wanted to walk again — that elevated that pain to the excruciating.



The physical stuff was hard, of course. But maybe he could’ve tolerated it. Maybe he could’ve led a normal life. Constrained by the limitations of his damaged body, yes, but normal enough. The problem, though, wasn’t just the pain — it was the fact that he had done this to himself. He relived that night on the bridge every waking hour. And soon he found himself returning to that spot. Waiting, watching.



He didn’t know what he was looking for. But he was drawn back and, night after night, he walked the length of the bridge, back and forth, until he saw daylight. He moved slowly. Each step jolted pain through his heel up the length of his spine. Over and over, he retraced his steps up to the edge and looked down at that spot in the bay. He could stand here for hours, willing the wind to force him forward and finish what he had started. He couldn’t bring himself to jump, though. Not again. Not while there was a chance, any chance, of consciousness at the other end. Each morning he came home bitter, unsatisfied, his legs throbbing. Yet each night, he couldn’t help but return. And two weeks into this burgeoning obsession, he was rewarded.



While pacing the bridge — maybe an hour before daybreak — he saw a man up on the railing, steeling himself for the jump. And his first thought was to stop him — truly — to try to reason with him — but before he got the chance, the man leapt. Immediately, then, something shifted in him. There was a shock. A hormonal spike. But underlying the immediate and the physical there was something more. 



This is what he came to understand: There’s a kind of string connecting every person to every other and through that string flows a substance — a kind of weight. In an interaction — any interaction — a conversation, say — weight flows along the string from one person to the other. You’ve felt it, this weight. Maybe you haven’t been able to fully articulate it — or even grasp it on a conscious level — but you’ve felt it. Over the course of an interaction, the flow might shift direction but at the end, when all is said and done, a transfer has occurred.



It’s not a surface-level emotional thing — it’s not a depressive thing, it’s not an alteration in mood — it’s the next layer down. You can have a conversation with someone and both of you might come away happy, both of you might come away upset. There’s no physical constraint on an emotional shift. But here there is a definite conservation and the string acts only to relocate weight from one person to the other. The emotions on the surface are fleeting, transitory. They’re chemical releases in the brain. This weight — this is the constant. This is the thing that transcends the synaptic into what some might call the soul. It’s an amplifier. It intensifies everything. It transforms an exchange of words into the profound. Into the devastating. For a certain kind of person — the kind more inclined to attract mass than repel it — it accrues to an unbearable level. It accrues to a level at which the person is encumbered beyond the limit of their soul. Where every new interaction, however slight, begins to impose a new, crushing burden.



This is all something he had sensed on a base level, just as you have sensed it. But when he saw another jumper — this is when it forced its way, immediately, to the forefront of his conscious mind. He recognised the strings, now, not as a metaphor but as a latent physical reality, clearly, strongly, tilted from him toward to the jumper and, throughout the descent, the deluge of mass away from him. He could feel that weight ripped through the string out into the night — into the falling body. The jump should’ve only taken seconds. But the string — or, rather, the flow through it — dilated time. It shifted not only his perception of reality but reality itself. The fall took minutes. And through those minutes, he became lighter.



It was some time before he could bring himself to move from this spot — the spot from which he watched the jump — and look over the edge. He wanted to thank the jumper for this gift. But more than that, he wanted — he needed — more. He returned home. His legs — and his body — they ached more than ever. But with that there was a powerful relief. A sense of openness, of possibility. He slept dreamlessly. 



When he woke he recognised a purpose in himself — a will — that had been absent for years. That day he began to rebuild the elements of his life. He began to rebuild relationships; he took steps to rebuild his career. He began to see for himself, again, a reason. But, even as these efforts began to bear fruit — over weeks, months of dedication to improvement — he could sense that this new state was precarious. He could sense that he needed to sure himself up, to release further weight to counteract that accrued from these efforts to enrich his life. He began to follow a pattern, then: In the day, he took on weight, he developed himself, he devoted himself to those around him. At night, he took the steps required to shed this weight. Each night, he trawled the bridge, and, each night, he searched for jumpers.



This persisted for two years. Past that first time, he didn’t try to talk to them. He didn’t try to stop them. At first this brought him shame. But he came to realise, over time, that there was no shame in acting on one’s need to survive. He had no obligation to these people. He had no duty of care. Jumpers made this sacrifice willingly, just as he once had. He just allowed them, from afar, to relieve his burden. And, so relieved, he was able to support a life for himself and those around him. He was able to develop meaning.



As with any high, though — from the purely chemical to the more fundamental — a tolerance began to build. He continued to trawl the bridge every night. He got what he needed — at least for a time. But the effect began to diminish. He could feel the steady, creeping accumulation of weight once again. The transference to jumpers, in each case, became less substantial, and the weight he took on throughout each day began to outstrip it. The jumpers weren’t frequent enough; each act of jumping wasn’t potent enough; the balance tipped and he felt, returning home from the bridge early each morning, the compounding burden on his soul.



His life, now, so painstakingly reconstructed, began to degrade. He couldn’t continue with his work. He couldn’t maintain his relationships. How could he, given the cost? Given the amplification of the pain it caused him? He saw, now, the inevitable — the slide back to his previous state, overburdened by new weight, overwhelmed by each and every interaction, once more drawn to oblivion, drawn to face the abyss. 



So he made a choice.



Watching a person jump — it couldn’t sustain him any longer. It couldn’t provide the degree of relief he needed. But through the understanding he had developed of the strings and flow of weight, he knew there remained an option open to him. Because it was so clear to him now that to feel that first transcendent flow again, he couldn’t just watch.



He had to be the one to deliver the push.
