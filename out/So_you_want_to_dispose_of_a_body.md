Hi there, you might remember me from informative posts such as [A Guide to the perfect murder],  and a more... first hand account kind of post, [Catfish]. I've steadily been drip feeding you fine people with methods to aid in your very own sadistic games. While doing this I found that my inbox became more popular than the comments section. 

&#x200B;

I became some sort of.. agony uncle for the amatuer serial killer and garden variety sociopath. Private inbox messages usually come in three forms. 

&#x200B;

**1.** People urging me to get help, like I need fucking saving or something? Do they not realise I do this by *choice*?

&#x200B;

**2.** People thanking me for my services to the cause, and asking for more information on my past hunts. They seem to get off on the finer details... I like these people.

&#x200B;

**3.** And last but not least, people asking for further help, to be specific help with the disposal. I went into quite a bit of detail in my 'How To' guide on what to do with a body and how to clean up but obviously people need a little more insight. 

&#x200B;

*I'm more than happy to help so I thought I would put together a more... indepth guide. A hands on approach if you will.*

&#x200B;

Forgive me if I cut this short at any point, I will be doing something I havent done before, I'm going to bring you along on a kill or two. I'll also be using 'Voice to Text' software so I apologise for any background noise picked up and audio recordings which I will submit to the kind admins here on NoSleep via audio files and they can input relevant information in **bold** where needed before this gets posted. 

&#x200B;

I'll be referring to steps from the '[How To] guide, so if you havent read that one I advise it. If you dont have the time,  you will still be able follow this perfectly fine but a better insight is recommended. I dont know how long those other posts will be available, im putting alot of information out there. 

&#x200B;

**\[The first recording starts with a chair scraping across what sounds like a metallic floor, a cough like sound can be heard from a male clearing his throat as he sits.\]** 

&#x200B;

'Right, recorder is...set up, and Voice to Text is set up it looks like we're...good to go. So, we can skip the segment on choosing a victim, and securing them in your chosen lockup by the overwhelming response I received you all have that part nailed. I bought a nice little unit a few months back and monitored it to determine if it would be suitable for this exercise and let me tell you, its perfect. Not a single soul has been by this road in weeks, its literally perfect.'

&#x200B;

 'I've taken the lead by bringing along a few... guests  **\[A muffled sob and the shuffling of something in the background can be just about heard\]** to aid me in this demonstration and to get right to the point of why we are doing this. All the prep is in place, Self Prep as mentioned before included. *DO NOT* forget the self prep, the last thing you want to do is go through all this meticulous planning only to be tripped up by a trace left behind, I've seen it happen to some great hunters in the past and I'd hate to read about one of you falling to the same fate.' 

&#x200B;

**\[The chair can be heard scraping back a little away from the mic, the male can be heard sighing as he gets up out of the chair. His footsteps can then be heard going away from the mic. Another heaving sound as something is lifted from the floor. As the footsteps grow louder with him getting closer to the mic the sobbing and muffled sound grows louder\]**

&#x200B;

'It's all down to *where* you have planned on disposing the body that determines *how* you dispose the body. I chose this location specifically so I can demonstrate the various ways of disposal without having to stop and start my work. As I'm sure you can hear, all three vic- guests, are still alive and well. Two are blindfolded and gagged, they can hear me but not see, the third has high quality ear defenders on but no blindfold and also gagged, she can see but not hear us. This is all for my own pleasure and not essential for the disposal. I do this as a power thing, I love the idea of the two blindly panicking, reacting to the noise around them.'

 **\[A loud 'clang' as metal hits metal followed by a scraping sound slowly across the floor results in hysterical muffled screams from two seperate unkown females, the commotion is followed by the sound of struggling which slowly dies down\]** 

'This feeling is only topped by my friend over there shackled to the support beam. She can't hear a single word I'm saying right now but she damn well saw how close this hatchet came to our blindfolded friend here.' **\[Quick footsteps away from the mic as the male strides towards the shackled female the other side of the lockup. More panicked muffled screams can be heard by all three females now.\]**

&#x200B;

**\[Shouting now can be heard across the room\] '**You see, I don't intend on killing this one until last, she doesn't know this of course, but sure as shit those two on the floor do now **\[muffled screaming increases, a gagging can be heard followed by surpressed vomiting\]** Oh? what's this? You see, ladies and gentlemen, an unexpected occurence can happen and you have to choose whether to go with it and see how it plays out or deal with it. In the case of this unfortunate lady choking on her own panic induced vomit I'm going to sit and watch.' **\[The sound of someone choking and gagging mixed with sharp nasal inhales builds and then...nothing, silence. The audio stays silent for almost 20 seconds until the male can be heard dragging presumably the woman away.\]** 

&#x200B;

'Ok, time to move.' **\[Instead of turning the audio off and relocating, the male can be heard picking up his equipment and carrying it past the woman still sobbing on the floor and then moments later past the woman shackled to the wall, also crying. A door can be heard opening and the slight sounds of nature can be heard. He was now outside.\]**

&#x200B;

 **'**For all of you wondering, the door you just heard has no handle, it can only be opened by key, which I have the only copy. Just another precaution. Also, I have left absolutely nothing within reach inside, so, if in the very unlikely event that one of those women get free I'm not met by a nasty surprise the next time I open the lockup. Ok so its now....15:45, we wont be working out in the mid day Sun thankfully, the next part you do not want to be doing out in the Sun! This one I will explain the method I mentioned in the guide, dismemberment and burning. I'll explain first then I'll get stuck in. I'm going to dismember her at all the joints, breaking her down into easily manageable parts then begin the actual disposal. The little pieces likes hands, feet, forearms and lower legs we will burn, then go at it again chopping up further. We will then burn it all again and dispose of the remnants out in the forest.  As for the ribcage, thighs, shoulders, pelvis, skull and  spine I've hired a compost mulcher. I know in the guide I mentioned burnng these then grinding them down but in all honesty I want to speed up the process and I found this method to be much much quicker.'

&#x200B;

**\[What followed was a gut wrenching 45 minute audio file of the sound of sawing, skin tearing and bones cracking. We had to listen to this in shifts to get the full audio noted as it was too much to listen to in one sitting. Once the sawing died down a fire was lit, the sound of crackling flesh and fat spitting from the heat will haunt me. The male can be heard whistling a cheerful tune in the background as if he were doing light garden work, this was one of the more unnerving things that stuck with us from this audio file.\]**

&#x200B;

'So now you have disposed of the remnants you can head back to one of your hidden locations mentioned in the guide, and change your clothing. I'm about... 3 mile from the closest waterway point I use so I'll go do that now and come back for the second woman.' 

**\[Audio file cuts off, the next file in the sequence starts back inside the lockup, he's not too close to the mic and can be heard talking quietly to someone, his words are inaudible at times.\]**

&#x200B;

**'-**^(If you promise to just- ... -Lets try again) Can you hear me better now? Dont want you missing out on any vital information **\[The male steps closer to the mic\]** This one I'm going to try something I didn't mention in the 'How To' guide but I find equally effective and *very* satisfying. I had to do a little bit of prep before I started recording this segment, had to fill the tub and bring it in ready. YOU GOT A GOOD VIEW BACK THERE?? Ah shit you can't hear me can you **\[The male can be heard chuckling to himself\]** Lets get on with this then shall we. So, the one thing that I love more than almost any other part, that drives me to do what I do... Is the look of helplessness on someones face as they take those last few breathes. God damn makes me hard just thinking about it. I found that over the years, and sampling many many ways of someones demise... drowning, is the pinnacle of pleasure for me. **\[****U****ncontrollable crying can be heard now, no muffled cries as the gag must have been removed, we assume the conversation we could not hear earlier were threats to stay quiet.\]** 

&#x200B;

**\[He can then be heard walking over to the crying woman and lifting her up. A few quiet pleas can be heard from the unidentified woman to be let go which he ignores. After a moments silence she can be heard being thrown into a body of water and thrashing around ensues. After a few minutes of screaming, gasping for air and water being thrown from the tub the audio goes silent. A minute or so later the male can be heard whistling again as he pulls her from the water, dropping her lifeless body to the floor. In the background the shackled woman witnessing all of this is in hysterics, crying and vomiting can continuously be heard as the man approaches the mic, resets his chair and takes a seat.\]**

&#x200B;

'This would usually be the point I would dispose of the body, very much in the same way I disposed of the first in all honesty, with a few minor adjustments. But alas, all good things must come to an end. For me my time today has run out, I've got to go pick up the kids, fetch the wife and play the happy family man. After all, keeping up the facade to those around you is key to staying undetected. And in all honesty, I'm enjoying the idea of our helpless restrained friend back there being stuck with this dead woman for a day or two. 

&#x200B;

I think I'll untie her, leave her for a few days. As I said, there's no way out of here anyway, and after a few days survival instinct will kick in. 

&#x200B;

I wonder how many days it will take for her to begin to feast on her friend to survive?

&#x200B;

Lets find out..
