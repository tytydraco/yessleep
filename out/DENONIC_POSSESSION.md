Anybody here have witnessed or experienced real DEMONIC POSSESSION?  I am expienicng it now .

 don't mean mental illness or schizophrenia, epilepsy or anything else but where you KNEW it was real Demonic possession. Maybe where someone opened a  door to it somehow, by a Ouija bored or even something that claimed to be Christian but was the devil in disguise? Anyone have ever been demon possessed and came out of it and then not know where you were and literally years of your life been gone? Anybody ever lost their teen years due to demonic possession? Anybody here ever became possessed after something that was supposed to be "Christian"? Anybody here ever experienced feeling the devil inside their body when they were possessed or a constant uncomfortable spiritual feeling? I'm looking for serious awnsers, and if your going to say "possession isn't real", don't comment.


 I'm here to hear people's experiences or stories they heard, witnessed etc. I myself am possessed, I know what it may be like when I get rid of it but I want it to be gone. When it leaves which will be soon, i might will think "where am I?" And I will have lost so many years, I will be 16 at 19 years old, well I am. The devil I feel it inside of me constantly it is so attached to me in a very unexplainable way that is purely demonic and spiritual . 




 did I get possessed you ask? From me praying with a supposed Christian man on YouTube who many had said they felt a amazing miracle healing from, I felt a spirit go into me that was supposed to be the holy spirit but it was not and it instantly took away my free will, long story short I have been possessed since. 


The devils have changed my personality almost completely in every single way, I also have moved into a entire different house since I have been posssessed, before I got possessed I had been very heartbroken over someone I had feelings for and  really thought I was actually having a medical cardio problem so I went to the heart doctor, he gave me a monitor etc but the reason I did that prayer video is because I thought I was having heart attacks due to my extreme stress over this girl (I'm also a girl) who was upsetting me. 





 have since learned if it's on the internet, it's  teaching, stay away, same for television, stick with your Bible (though I realize many of you reading may not be Christian, but for those who are.) I miss struggling with my own just human problems without a devil influencing me. I hate the feeling, the constant uncomfortable spiritual feeling that this devil has in me constant. It's unexplainable and very real, I can feel the devil throughout my entire being. 





 It is so attached to me absolutely. So many of my teen years gone because of this and I can't get them back. As far as the "horror movie stuff" I can say the real possession is not like the movies, and is really not something that can be explained in my expierence with words in the human language, because it is not of this world what I expierenced. Some things that I did expierence that would be similar to stereotypical horror movie things would be that I would have to say "devil" for comfort at times. Would have like "tics" where I would unintentionally have a angry burst and say I love the devil, like it was a body reflex almost . I had a hard time saying Jesus was my lord and savior at times but sometimes it tricked me into thinking it made me closer with God.



 It influenced me into having basically my entire personality changed and being super insecure about the real me also, but not in a normal societal way but a literal and demonic way. I can feel the devil inside of my being my arms my hands body every part of me my back legs etc all of me constantly it's literal torture. Please tell me if any of you have had or heard of similar expierence.  I believe real cases of demonic possession are rare and that most are misdiagnosed, a mental breakdown, fake, trolls, paranoia etc but mine is a very real very rare case and I'm wondering if there is others like it
