I first came to Almora in the winter of 1997, when the air still carried the faint smell of woodsmoke and pine sap, and the evenings closed in earlier than my Delhi-trained eyes were used to. My editor at the magazine had given me a simple assignment: document the crafts and folklore of the Kumaon region for a year-end feature. On paper, it was a career break, a chance to collect photographs and interviews and return with something polished. In truth, I had said yes because I needed to be far from Delhi. Far from my crumbling marriage, from the conversations that had turned into negotiations, from the slow erosion of my home into a place where silence felt heavier than words.

The town seemed suspended between centuries. Old British-era houses clung to the slopes, their slate roofs shining when it rained, and narrow lanes twisted between tea shops and shuttered storefronts. Above the bazaar, the road climbed toward Kasar Devi, where the pine forest grew thicker and the air thinned into something sharper. From my rented room in a two-storey house on Lower Mall, I could see the terraced fields step down into a valley, and further beyond, the faint white of the high Himalayas on clear mornings.

It was during my first week that I heard the first mention of the well. Not as a warning, not even as a story. I had stopped at a small dhaba for chai, and the owner, a man with the thick accent of the hills, was telling another customer about a water shortage in the upper wards. The words “purane kuan ke paas”(near the old well) slipped into the conversation, old well, as casually as if it were just a landmark. But the other man made a quick gesture, the sort you make when shooing away a bad omen, and the topic shifted. I might have forgotten it entirely if I had not seen the well the next day, half-hidden behind an abandoned house on a bend in the road toward Bright End Corner.

It was not remarkable at first glance. A low stone wall, blackened with moss, a rusting pulley hanging over its mouth. No bucket. The air around it was cooler, and when I leaned slightly over the wall, I could see the water far below, still as glass.

That night, I dreamed of water. Not the gentle flow of a stream, but the sensation of standing waist-deep in it, unable to move, the cold locking my limbs in place. I woke to the sound of footsteps on the veranda. When I opened the door, the narrow wooden balcony was empty, yet the floorboards held a faint trail of wet footprints leading toward the street.

I told myself it was my mind playing tricks. The hills were quiet at night, and quiet could be unsettling when you came from a city that never slept.

The people here were friendly in the way small towns often are, warm but reserved. When I asked the elderly landlord, Mr. Rawat, about the well, his expression tightened. He told me the water was not safe for drinking and that children were told to stay away. That was all. Later, over drinks at the only bar in town, a younger man named Hitesh offered a little more.

“They call her Paani ki Rani,” he said, leaning in as if the words themselves might draw attention. The Water Queen. “Long ago, before independence, she lived in a big house up on the ridge. Her husband was away for months, some kind of official, and she was alone except for the servants. There was talk of a love affair, maybe with a soldier posted nearby. When her husband returned, something happened. No one is sure what. But one winter morning, she was found in that well. Some say she jumped. Others…” He trailed off, watching my face. “It is bad luck to speak too much of her.”

I thought about asking more, but the bar was noisy and warm, and the story seemed like one of those half-remembered local tragedies that every old town has.

Still, I found my steps taking me past the well more often than necessary. Sometimes there was a faint scent of wet earth and jasmine. Once, in the mist, I thought I saw a figure in a white saree standing beside it. When I blinked, there was only the stone wall and the shifting fog.

By late December, the work that had brought me to Almora was progressing well enough. I had notebooks filled with sketches and interviews, rolls of film waiting to be developed. But something in me had changed. My sleep was restless. I began to hear sounds in the night: the creak of a door, the soft splash of water. Once, I woke to find my shoes soaked through, though I could not recall stepping outside.

One evening, Mrs. Rawat mentioned, almost in passing, that her husband’s uncle had been among the men who pulled the woman from the well decades ago. The body, she said, had been unmarked, as though the fall had not harmed her at all. “Her eyes were open,” she whispered, “like she was still looking for someone.”

In January, the dreams grew more vivid. I saw her face clearly now, pale and beautiful, framed by wet hair. She would speak, but the words came as a rush of water in my ears. I began to feel, absurdly, that she was trying to tell me something.

One night, after a particularly long day of interviews in the upper villages, I walked home past the well. The moonlight fell in a silver sheet across the stones. And there she was. Not mist, not a trick of the light. A woman in a white saree, bare feet on the cold ground, looking at me with eyes that seemed impossibly deep. She did not move as I approached, though the air around her felt heavier, pressing in.

“You came,” she said, her voice almost breaking. “I have been waiting.”

The next thing I knew, I was standing at the lip of the well, looking down. The water shimmered, though there was no wind. Her hand was on my arm, gentle but cold enough to burn. “Just one step,” she whispered.

A shout broke the moment; Hitesh, calling my name from the road. The grip vanished. I stumbled back, and when I looked again, the space beside me was empty.

I left Almora in February. The magazine ran my feature with photographs of markets and temples and artisans at work. Nowhere in the article was the well mentioned. Yet something of it stayed with me. Over the years, small misfortunes began to follow me. Opportunities fell through at the last moment. Relationships withered without clear reason. In every new city, I would sometimes wake in the night to the sound of dripping water.

It is 2025 now, and I had not spoken of her in years. This afternoon, at a gathering, someone asked about my time in the hills. Without thinking, I began to tell this story. And as I spoke, I noticed a faint wetness seeping into the cuff of my shirt. The air in the room grew cold, though the summer heat outside was unbroken.

In the doorway, just beyond the edge of the light, I think I saw her. Watching. Waiting.

And I remember Hitesh once saying, almost as a joke, that her curse could only end when her story was told to someone who believed.

I can see your face as you read this.

I wonder if you believe me.
