**There’s a folklore in my school that has existed for generations, but it was real.**

I only felt regret, again and again. It is useless to try to flatten my shattered mind after seeing that tree. I know I will not be in this world much longer, but this must be known. I hope no one else makes the same mistake.

I was at a school called St John's College, which, perhaps, would not be found on any record or maps now. It was located on an island they called Turtle Island, which looked exactly like a titanic turtle floated. 

The campus and dormitory were on different sides of the island; therefore, we took school buses to move between the dormitory and the campus itself.

Miko, a boy with red hair, we were in the same dorm room, he was the chairman of a secret student organization called the "Party of Red Hair." 

Miko wasn't someone really nice to me, but that day he totally changed. He walked in with an envelope sealed in dried blood.

He walked toward my bed, his eyes full of horror.

"This one is for you," he said in a strangely soft voice unlike his mocking sound before.

"It’s strange. I found this at the bus stop today. I thought it was something lost by a schoolmate, until I saw your name on it," he continued.

"The words were written in something scarlet... it looks like blood. I didn’t open it. Perhaps you have trouble with the mob or some weirdos. Good luck to you, and take care."

He left the room at a fast speed, as if escaping something in horror. I touched the seal. It was sticky and smelled of iron. I opened the envelope, and my heart stopped. The name at the top was "Duke Windson." Duke was my best friend who had died of cancer when we were ten.

I began to read the letter, and a wave of horror washed over me. The content was chilling:

"Dear Will, I hope this letter finds you well, because we are soon going to meet again—in hell."

"I still remember everything from when I was alive. Time is just nonsense to me now. I am not what mortals call death. I, and others, are at a state beyond your understanding. We are not at the other side; perhaps closer to hell in your language, but that is not totally accurate."

"You will know what I mean soon, Will, my best but only friend. That night when you took me home, I was pretty weak. My parents left me alone, knowing every effort was useless against the rules of nature. But what happened next will destroy everyone’s idea about life and death."

"After I closed and opened my eyes, I was on a road, the dark road covered with sand. Perhaps I was just in heaven, I thought at that time, but this heaven seems different from what I saw in the books."

"The starless sky above me, trees stretched their hands.  I can hear the sound of the sea, the tide rising and falling. Everything else was pretty quiet. I don't really know why I walk on this road, the road that I didn't visit before, perhaps this was the fate. "

"I walked for a long time in silence; there was no sound of birds and bugs, only the sound of my footsteps on the dark sand road and the sound of the sea. I can feel the strong odor of the sea, until suddenly I hear the sound of the engine from behind. I thought of nothing more than a car passing by, so I just turned my neck to see if anything could be special this time."

The letter just ended suddenly.

He seem left me to imagine this, which sounds like the murmur from a madman, but really followed his pattern of imaginative, perhaps he just wrote everything before, and delegated someone to give this to me at this time. Just make his last trick for me after his death.

I thought this might be Miko's trick before, but I still can't explain why he wrote like my friend; his writing was pretty messy. Perhaps Miko uses some effort trying to shock me to death. I thought.

"What if this were true? He tried to tell me something," I thought. This intrusive idea just like a stimuli active my neurons in the brain. I begin to read the letter again more carefully. Until my eyes finally fixed on the line "...on the sand road and sound of sea..." This wasn't the trails that could exist in the town where he lived.

Our town wasn't near the coast, and none of the trails were made of sand like that. But there's only one place I know that can be similar to his description: The turtle island, the trail that connects dorm rooms and our campus, or perhaps just his imagination? There are a bunch of other trails like this in this world.

Suddenly, a knocking on my door and heavy footsteps awoke me from my immersion. Miko reappeared, his face panicked and sweaty.

"Will, I think we got something really bad. Something horrible on this island," Miko panted. He looked pretty different from how he was supposed to act in this situation.

This time, the true horror was revealed in his eyes, which told me he wasn't lying or making another mischief; he tried to shock me more than once.

"The old folklore has been proved today, just like 500 years ago. We shall not ignore those tales; they are not nonsense. The only reason I literally run kilometers through the trail to see you in this dormitory is that perhaps."

"Perhaps what? " I asked in a lack of patience.

"Perhaps that we are the only two men alive on this island."

I tried to pretend to be calm, but I failed and began to get in range. "Please tell me you are joking, Miko. I already get sick of your ideas!"

"Last time was your damn skulls, this time first was a damn letter from my deceased friend, and then you told me others have died! Do you think I would believe you?"

"Do you remember last time you took me to your party's secret hall and let me take a look at 100 skeletons of the ancestors as decoration on the upper floor? How shocking that was to me! I almost called the police! "

"Now I can tolerate it no more. Get back to your party and leave me alone! You don't know you are humiliating my miserable friends this time?" I almost screamed at him due to rage

"Please, Will, " His voice softer, "this time is true! Just believe me. I sincerely apologize for what happened in that hall that night. It was my fault. But this time, it was really, already out of my understanding," He began to speak in a begging voice.

"Please, Will, the letter I gave you was actually true. I am sorry to hear about your friend, but you can look at that again, it was not my writing style, I wasn't someone good at writing," He said.

"I am just waiting for you to apologize for almost a year," I said, then I gave him a glass of water and took him to sit on my bed for a while. When he finally stopped gasping, he spoke again.

"Do you know that on this island, there’s a cave, deep underground? Every 500 years, daemons—the unspoken things—come out and cause an earthquake. It sounds absurd, but it really happened in history, and it's also going to happen today!"

He took out a yellowish book. "I stole it from the school’s archive. It happened on this island, 500 years ago!"

"Wait?" I said. "You mean no one stops you? The guard was pretty annoying, you know."

"Yep, no one is trying to stop me. They are. I can't explain too much, but we have to go to the campus now. Something is totally wrong here. Prepare to be shocked this time.

I opened the old book. Some part of it already been destroyed by mold, the yellowish page showed it was really old. It was a diary from the founder of St. John's College. It explained how the missionaries founded the school here, and the first group of students were the kids of the local islanders. They seemed to enjoy the school at first, and for a while, everything was peaceful.

However, one day, the elders of the tribes suddenly pay a visit to the missionaries in a state of absolute panic.

"Please, stop the school, because the monsters, the daemons, will go out today!" the elder who can speak English warned them.

"Every 500 years, when the island begins moving, the daemons will rise from the holes, and everyone will die. Please, hide all the kids in the caves above the mountain and close the school!"

Obviously, the missionaries ignored the warnings as superstition and asked them to leave the school as soon as possible. They don't have time for those boring stories.

However, later that night, a missionary named John dreamed of his dead mother standing beside his bed. She was calling him. Her voice, every tone, every word's style, was accurate with his memory.

She was calling him, follow her, they will go to a place, a place that has no pain, illness, only happiness and immortality, embrace this precious gift to the undying. She said. However, reality dragged him up from his dream.

Suddenly, the ground shook so hard that he was thrown from his bed.

He opened his eyes and found his mother's voice still beside him. He looked around and just saw his brother standing there, calling him in his mother's voice.

Behind his brother’s head, a blood-colored flower was blooming. He tried to take it out, but its roots were growing deep into the skull. He rushed out of the room in fear. Around him, every islander and his colleagues had the same flower blooming from their heads.

When we finished reading, the land began to shake. Every muscle in our bodies shivered. We held each other’s hands and walked quietly out of the empty dormitory.

Under the dark, starless sky—the same day Duke had described—we walked onto that dark road full of sand. Then we heard it: the sound of an engine. But this time, it was not behind us. It was right in front of us, on the campus. We prepared for anything that might be waiting for us.
