**There’s a folklore in my school that has existed for generations, but it was real.**

I only felt regret, again and again. It is useless to try and flatten my shattered mind after seeing that tree. I know I will not be in this world much longer, but this must be known. I hope no one else makes the same mistake.

Miko, a boy with red hair, was the chairman of a secret student organization called the "Party of Red Hair." There were rumors they were associated with taboo rituals and human sacrifices. My first year was fine until Miko walked in one day with an envelope sealed in dried blood.

He walked toward my bed, his eyes full of horror.

"This one is for you," he said in a strangely soft voice.

"It’s strange. I found this at the bus stop today. I thought it was something lost by a schoolmate, until I saw your name on it," he continued.

"The words were written in something scarlet... it looks like blood. I didn’t open it. Perhaps you have trouble with the mob or some weirdos. Good luck to you, and take care."

He left the room at a fast speed, as if escaping something in horror. I touched the seal. It was sticky and smelled of iron. I opened the envelope and my heart stopped. The name at the top was "Duke Windson." Duke was my best friend who had died of cancer when we were ten.

I began to read the letter, and a wave of horror washed over me. The content was chilling:

"Dear Will, I hope this letter finds you well, because we are soon going to meet again—in hell."

"I still remember everything from when I was alive. Time is just nonsense to me now. I am not what mortals call death. I, and others, are at a state beyond your understanding. We are not at the other side; perhaps closer to hell in your language, but that is not totally accurate."

"You will know what I mean soon, Will, my best but only friend. That night when you took me home, I was weak and unconscious. My parents left me alone, knowing every effort was useless against the rules of nature. But what happened next will destroy everyone’s idea about life and death."

"When I was walking on that dark road, the starless sky above me, trees stretched their hands. Everything was silent, until I heard the sound of the engine."

Suddenly, a knocking on my door and heavy footsteps awoke me from my immersion. Miko reappeared, his face panicked and sweaty.

"Will, I think we got something really bad. Something horrible on this island," Miko panted.

"The old folklore has been proved today, just like 500 years ago. We shall not ignore those tales; they are not nonsense. There’s something beyond our understanding happening right here. Perhaps this is connected with your friend’s letter, but I found something more terrible."

I gave him a glass of water. When he finally stopped gasping, he spoke again.

"Do you know that on this island, there’s a cave, deep underground? Every 500 years, daemons—the unspoken things—come out and cause an earthquake. It sounds absurd, but it really happened in history, and it will happen today!"

He took out a yellowish book. "I stole it from the school’s archive. It happened on this island, 500 years ago!"

I opened the old book. It was a diary from the founder of St. John's College. It explained how the missionaries founded the school here, and the first group of students were the kids of the local islanders. They seemed to enjoy the school at first, and for a while, everything was peaceful.

However, one day, the elders suddenly found the missionaries in a state of absolute panic.

"Please, the monsters, the daemonic creatures will appear today!" the elders warned.

"Every 500 years, when the island begins moving, the daemons will rise from the abyss and everyone will die. Please, send all the kids to safety shelters and close the schools!"

The missionaries ignored the warnings as superstition. However, later that night, a missionary named John dreamed of his dead mother standing beside his bed. Suddenly, the ground shook so hard he was thrown from his bed.

He woke to see his brother standing there, calling him in his mother's voice. Behind his brother’s head, a blood-colored flower was blooming, its roots growing deep into the skull. Every islander he saw had the same flower blooming from their head.

When we finished reading, the land began to shake. Every muscle in our bodies shivered. We held each other’s hands and walked quietly out of the empty dormitory.

Under the dark, starless sky—the same day Duke had described—we walked onto that dark road. Then we heard it: the sound of an engine. But this time, it was not behind us. It was right in front of us, at the campus.
