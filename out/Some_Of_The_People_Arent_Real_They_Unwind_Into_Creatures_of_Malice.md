I've begun noticing things recently, odd things. Not quite horrific, but, disturbing all the same. I precisely remember the first instance of the bizzare string of happenings, which would soon lead me to question the very reality in which i find myself. There can be no doubt about that. It was when I, in my foolishness, decided to follow up on the age old adage of making eye contact with strangers, as a way of warming oneself back up towards society.

I'm something of a habitual hermit. I live in cycles of brief and inhumanely hard labour, followed by a rather indulgent withdrawal from society once i've gathered enough funds. You'd be surprised how easy it is to implement, so long as you're ready to bare fourteen-hour workdays, and an ascetic lifestyle during the hermit season.  
It's not particularly important for what i'm about to transcribe, aside for maybe, if you were to use it as means by which to question my sanity(Which i uphold, is not in danger of falling in on itself, as odd as my routine may be).

It had been three months, two weeks, and one day into my hermitage when the incident occured. It happened during a routine supply run to one of the rundown corner stores in the area. My funds were beginning to run dry, and so, i began to ease myself back into the despised cycle of social interaction, as i've always done. Except, this time, when I lifted my gaze from the tips of my shoes, and towards the dischevelled man standing next in line to me, something rather unexpected had happened.

When i met his gaze, instead of a blank and glossy expression i've so expected, an impossible reflection stared back at me, deep from within what i now doubt were his eyes. It was a sight i have never seen before, in fiction or nature. Inside of the man's "eyeball" was a nonesnsical infinity. It had taken in the light reflecting itself off of the enviroment, and twisted it into a mess of ever-shifting shapes. They moved in a manner that i was sure, not even the most bizzare of celestial bodies, and oddities of physics could produce.

Looking into the "eyes" of his i've felt primordial fear, the kind that has almost been bred out of the human populace as civillization triumphed over the night. It reminded me of the feeling a child particularly dependant on their parents may feel, when it's caretakers leave briefly, and fail to inform the child of the temporary nature of their departure. Pure and unbrindled fear coupled with an overwhelming failure to comprehend. All the accompanying physical responses to terror followed suit. I was trembling, sweating bullets into my cheap "wifebeater" of a shirt, my heart was running millions of paces a second, and yet i couldn't take my gaze off of the stranger's impossible "eyes".

For some people, this might've been a reason to question whether or not they're going through some sort of an episode, be it mental, or medical. I must admit, i was on the verge of doing so myself, until i looked down into the man's shopping basket. It was filled with the following.  1 Bottle of a hundred mililiters of liquor - broken, four packets of over the counter painkillers - intact, one packet of an off-brand viagra - intact, more than twenty packs of a chewing gum - various flavours, 6 packs of tinfoil wrapping - intact, one paper towel - intact, one can of coke - open and spilling onto all of the above, alongside the mess of things he was actively stuffing in there from the shelves closest to the cashier, his movements automatic and independent of his gaze, which was still locked onto my own.

I was familiar with the layout of the shop as i frequented it often, and concluded, that it's the kind of an assortment one would get if they were just mindlessly roaming the store, and grabbing around at whatever may lie at their fingertips. This suspicion was confirmed as quickly as it had been had, seeing as the stranger was still yet stuffing more and more of the store's assortment into his already overflowing basket.

Now, i understand that the man might seem like just your average drug-addled pilgrim, out and about untowards a destination known only to himself, and God. To that i say, one: Drugs are not common in the area this had taken place in, and two: You hadn't seen the sheer impossibility of his gaze. It's not something any substance i've ever known of could cause.

Betraying the rational part of my mind, and risking a likely stabbing, i called out towards the shambling man.

"Q-quite the assortment you've got there. What's the uh, big occasion, hah?"  The sound of my own voice scared me almost as much as the man's facsimile of a face, now contorted into a spectre of confusion.

"Ye-ehs." He responded, feigning understanding, still keeping his "eyeballs" that couldn't be locked onto me.

"Say, that bottle in your basket's leaking. Seems like a waste, i think. You sure you want to buy that one?" Internally i begged the stranger, God, the spirit of the world, and any who would listen, for the man to betray some sign of humanity at last.

"No-ouh" He said, tilting his head to the side under an angle which bordered at inhuman.

"So, are you going to exchange it for another?"

"No-ouh" He said.

"But you just said you don't want that one, so which one is it?! What do you mean?! And what the hell is wrong with your eyes?!"

"Ye-ehs" He said. Same exact intonation as the first time i've ever heard him speak.

As soon as my piqued interest left the man's immediate concern, he went off to get his groceries processed. I stayed and observed. He spoke not a word, and when informed of the price he'd have to pay for all of them, the man had stared off into the horizon, and stood there, swaying for an uncomfortably long while, before marching out.

I followed suit, but the man was nowhere to be seen, as if though he vanished upon stepping outside of the corner store's domain.

In the days to come I began to notice more and more people with "eyes" just like his. They seemed to follow me everywhere i went, and all of them had the same mixture of an absent mind, and an aura of danger as the man i've observed that day.

That's when I chose to extend my hermitage for another month, in order to better understand whatever it is they were.  


  
It would be impossible to convey just how much it felt like i was being stalked in a brief message, so i will instead lay out all of the happenstances involving the odd-eyed "people" that i had noticed, and can recall aptly.

Opting to kill two birds with one stone, i've taken this as further means of preparing myself for the work-cycle to come. My methodology was as follows. I would go out and wander the town, keeping my eyes peeled for anything out of the ordinary. It wasn't long until i spotted another odd-eyed person.

The second day of my "hunt", while quietly strolling through the city under the hot midday sun i've witnessed a labourer high up on a ladder, utility vest on, but no helmet covering up his badling bulbous head. He was doing something with the fiberoptic cable box mounted on the utility pole, and the company car was nowhere to be seen.

He stuck out immediately, taking his unfocused and impossible gaze from the cable box at hand, and locking it onto me immediately, as soon as he could see me pass through. His "eyes" were exactly as the ones i've seen before, lodged in the homeless man's fakeout of a face. Immediately it stuck out to me, that same as the previous odd-eyed "person", the fiberoptic worker didn't seem capable of true understanding, and his apparent position in society was nothing more than an empty shell meant ot conceal something brittle and dangerous.

For one, the company car was nowhere to be seen. Am i to believe he was just lugging the ladder around all on his own, throughout God only knows how many kilometers of infrastructure? And on that point, it was completely and utterly illegal to even be that high up on your own, without another person securing the ladder. I had worked in that industry briefly, and the managment while crooked in their own right would've never allowed something like this. It wasn't conclusive evidence of inhumanity, but it was something to note.

I opted to keep walking at a slow pace and see if he'd follow. As soon as i've made it almost out of his view and around a nearby corner, he attempted to walk on air to get near me. The ladder fell out of position dragging him with it. His left leg locked itself against one of the ladder rungs, making it so that he fell first hitting the ground face on before being slammed with the full weight and impetus of the falling ladder.

He never stopped to process the pain this injury would've caused to any sane man. Instead he attempted to get out from underneath the ladder immediately after the impact. He did so without clear understanding of the mechanics of gravity, and forgetting the fact that his now-bent leg was still wrapped around one of the rungs. After a bit he managed to get it off and without a pause began to limp towards me.

Fearing direct confrontation with a possibly-agitated pretender of a person, i sprinted away in panic. Once out of breath, and out of the sight of that horrid being, i've opted to return home for the day. I was seriously spooked.

Needless to say, the experience had made me even more paranoid than  i was previously. Unfortunately it confirmed several of my fears. It meant that whatever the homeless man was, there were more of them. Furthermore, they knew, that i knew of their existence, and they had taken interest in me, possibly because of it.

While the corner store encounter might've been experienced away as a meeting with a fryout junkie, this happening was far more odd, and consistent with what i've seen of the first man. One is an accident, two is a coincidence, and it wouldn't be long until i saw the third.

After having regained my stamina i broke into a half-jog, and made my way ontowards my car. About halfway through i was stopped dead in my tracks by a mother and her stroller-seated brat. She had blocked my way almost intentionally. In my mind i was prepared to fight for my life, adrenaline soaring through to the point i felt both faint and manic at the same time.

When i inspected the woman, her eyes were normal. I still worried, because of the way she seemingly stopped me dead in my tracks. She was wearing a weather-approporiate sundress and a hat which nicely complimented her shapely face. She was the sparking image of the everyday woman. The embodiment of everything the world should be filled with, and a welcome change of pace to the odd-eyed freaks i was so preoccupied with recently.

While gathering the wits to jog around her, apologize for almost crashing into her child, or backing out entirely... It hit me.-

I hadn't even think to look over the child. It was sleeping and it's eyes were closed. I remembered my own childhood, dozing off in the stroller as me and my mother passed on through the pleasant neighbourhood. Because of it's comfortable nap, i couldn't possibly inspect the eyes.

The rules were unclear. Both of the previous odd-eyed beings were pretending to be middle-aged males, but why should there be an age limit to their trickery? The fiberoptic man was able to hold down a job, seemingly. At the very least he wore company clothing. Could they spontanously take over and wear the skin of unsuspecting folk? Or were they born in a hole somewhere in full disguise, ready to descend onto civillization? If it was the former, the child couldn't be trusted.

Taking my chances, i yelled at it. It was an ugly, adrenaline-fueled and an almost primal yelp. I let it go on for far longer than i intended to, and by the end of it my vocal chords ached, and i became breathless. I immediately hated myself for my paranoia, and even moreso, for having been wrong.

The child awoke, and it's eyes were nothing like the ones donned by the gazers. It was nothing but a sweet infant, ashook by the shouts of a mad man. I felt a mix of guilt and shame wash over me as the woman jumped in to defend her child.

"What the hell is wrong with you, you creep?! Get the hell away from my baby!" 

\-I'm s-sorry! It's just that- Some- Some of the people aren't people, and your child had it's eyes closed and i just had to check-...

I attempted to defend my stance, still unused to the sound of my own voice. When i saw her taking out her phone, assumedly to call the authorities, i've decided to call it quits and retreat home. I jogged past her, switching to a sprint during the last quarter of the way.

As soon as i've reached my car, i floored it, likely violating many speed limitations, and headed on home. That night i slept little. 

I busied myself fighting over what's true. Had i been wrong about all of this? Or just the child? I reasoned, that if i accurately witnessed reality to my disadvantage, then there was no reason to doubt it in the instances it came to benefit me.

I was not delusional. I just jumped to conclusion seeing the child. They were real, and they were a threat to me.

In the days to come i would be proven right in my assesment, as i've spied many more gazers.

A municipal worker lifted up a manhole cover without the use of tools, staring daggers into the now open sewerhole, before dropping the manhole cover onto his foot as soon as he saw me, in a perfectly vertical position. The fifty-kilogram cover "slid in" into his flesh, seperating it from the rest of his body at the mid-foot.

Sounds of a crunching bone, and glass being broken followed. The man kept his gaze dead-centered on me, before looking at his now-mutilated foot and calmly stating "Sh-e-i-t... O--H.". He kept watching me, and his gaping foot-hole failed to spill forth blood. I left. When i came back three hours later, he wasn't there. I grabbed the sliced part of his foot for proof and stored it in a zip-bag inside of my glovebox compartment.

Then, there was a woman who couldn't understand door locks and so opted to crawl out through a window instead, from the second floor of an apartment complex. She was overweight and the plop of fat i had heard as she hit the ground was the only real thing about her.

I had almost gotten used to seeing them by that point. The gazers hadn't yet done anything outwardly malicious yet. They appeared to be as curious of me as i was of them. If they were some sort of a parasitic being, surely they would opt to feast on scraps and tidbits of food everpresent throughout all of civillization and guarded by none, right? This naive belief was squashed on the second week of my observation.

A street performer sat on the corner, badly bumbling his way through some song i'm sure he must've made up on the spot. He wore sunglasses and thus, i couldn't have "clocked" him immediately as a gazer. The second i carelessly let myself walk within, say, ten meters of him, he let the guitar fall out of his hands and immediately jolted to sprint at me.

I sat there frozen for a split second before breaking into a desperate a desperate run, aiming to escape the now-apparent threat. I was screaming for help all the way through, hoping desperately that someone would hear me and at least observe as this unnatural being harmed me in a way previously unseen by nature and man.

He almost caught up to me, the tips of his fingers brushing against my back. I felt a stinging pain in places too great in number to count. The hurt gave me enough energy to shake him off for a bit. I continued to desperately yelp for help as i ran.

Thankfully, a pair of police officers enjoying snacks from a cafe up ahead have heard the commotion. Not knowing who the perpetrator is, in spite of how clear i've made it with my sobs and yells, the tackled both of us.

At that we went limp in fear and bewildermen, both me, and the gazer united as man, and monster if only for a brief stint. I remained quiet and he began cycling through words.

"Mu-sieik" He pleaded his case.

"Mon-uy... hat" He attempted to explain, and get the authorities to see it his way.

I remained silent and ashook, before one of the officers, the taller of the group forced me up, and asked me to explain the situation.

"Sir, my name is officer Bradley. We'd like you to explain what happened here. Has this man tried to mug you, or something like that? Would you like to press charges?"

\-I uh- It's- A bit hard to explain, officer. I'm afraid that if i told you the truth, i'd be seen as a mad man.

"M-mmmmmmmmhmhm. I'm going to need you to try your best, regardless of how looney it might sound, but trust me, we've heard some weird stuff over the years."

\-He's uh-, There's a... How should i put this- There's a group of creatures, erm, - People. They have it out for me. I don't know why. They've been observing me. This is the first time i've been hurt by one of them.

"Huh-. Well, can't say that sounds like something a sane man would say, but you seem lucid enough. We'll make a note of that. Would you like to press charges? We'll need you to come by the precint for a statement if s- W-What the hell?!"

The now-cuffed Musician began shaking on the ground, whilist repeating various phrases he must've inferred over however long he was around pretending for.

"Mo-noooey... H-a-uuut-." He attempted to relay, as he was spitting out copious amounts of blood. I think i thin strips of stomach lining come up alongside it as i've watched. I couldn't be too sure.

Officer Bradley shouted to his partner to call for an ambulance, as he began administering first-aid. 

It wasn't long before the Musician perished, and yet- His eyes remained the same puzzling enigma of ever-reflecting prisms. In my heart of hearts, i didn't believe he was dead. Not the part of him that mattered, anyway.

After i had declined medical aid, the police took my contact information, and set me on my way. They said they'd contact me if it was ever prudent to do so.

My wound stung, but i didn't think them to be serious. They were however, wholly unusual. Once i've arrived home, i'd inspected them under a mirror, which was no easy task seeing as the brunt of them resided on my back.

It was a cacophony of slashes, each differing in angle, and the "depth". A few barely grazed me, but the majority dug deep into the skin. The Musician didn't have a weapon on him, i was sure of that. My mind began running through possibilities. It was a matter of survival now. If i had any hope of living through-, whatever this crisis was, i had to at least understand the principles under which it operated.

Again and again, i ran into a brick wall while trying to explain the nature of my injuries. Could it have been fingernails? No, the cuts ran too deep. Could he have had a weapon on him after all? That wasn't it either, i hadn't seen anything on him the whole time he was being handled by the cops. 

It must've been something used by whatever being was in control of these facismiles of humans. Their "claws", and "teeth". I still thought of them as animals. An undiscovered parasitic species, maybe, but still one that had to adhere to laws of physics.

Is there such a thing in nature, as an invisible claw, or an imperceptible stinger? Then again, my back \*was\* turned on the Musician as he inflicted these wounds.

Frustrated, scared, anxious and angry, i decided to cut my oh-so enlightening brainstorm short. I drank to calm my nerves, it doesn't matter what brand of liquor, but i'll say this, it was strong, and i've had more than i should've given the situation.

I laid in the bed, appreciating the way liquor made my ear-drums ring. I failed to stop my mind from trying to come up with an answer to the injuries i've faced. Little did know, i would find out their inner workings in the morning, midway through a "siege" of gazers.
