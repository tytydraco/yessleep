I watched the old man from the shadows in the corner of his living room room. The same place I’d been watching him from for the past three nights.

If he ever turned around, he’d easily see me standing behind him but he never did. He was too busy following his after-dinner routine which involved a glass of whiskey and a book of crossword puzzles, which, from the tattered look of it he’d been working on for some time.

I was originally going to kill him the first night I observed him, but I changed my mind when I saw that he only had two more puzzles to finish in the book before it was done.

“What’s an eight-letter word for cheerful readiness?” the man asked out loud.

He wasn’t asking me. Asking out loud was just one of the ways he worked through the puzzles. At least I thought it was until I realized he was actually talking to his dead wife.

I figured it out when I saw him turn and look at a picture of her that was sitting on the mantle above the fireplace.

Seeing that gave me an idea.

When he returned his attention to the crossword puzzle. I floated closer to the picture so I could see it more clearly.

Once I had all of her details memorized, I altered the shape of my body to mimic hers. After the change was complete, I eased myself into the chair opposite his.

“Alacrity,” I said softly in his wife’s voice.

“What?” he looked over at me, confused by what he was seeing.

“An eight-letter word that means cheerful readiness. The answer is alacrity.”

“Mary?” tears filled his eyes, “What’re you doing here?”

“I came back to help you with your last puzzle,” I gestured at the book.

The old man opened his mouth to say something else but I stopped him with a raised hand.

“I don’t have much time so I need you to do me a favor,” I said, “Okay?”

He nodded.

“I need you to pretend that I never left and it’s just the two of us spending a nice quiet evening at home. Can you do that for me?”

He nodded again.

The two of us spent the next hour finishing the final crossword puzzle in his book. After he wrote the last word, he closed the book and set it aside.

“Now what?” the tears had returned to his eyes.

“Now I have to go,” I said, getting to my feet.

“I want to go with you,” he also rose.

“Are you sure that’s what you want?” I asked, taking a step towards him.

“I’m positive,” he replied, “There’s nothing left here for me but memories.” He glanced around the room, “I’d rather be with you.”

I took another step towards him and embraced him. As soon as my arms closed around him he started sobbing.

“We’ll be together soon,” I whispered into his ear before sinking my fangs into his neck.
