~~Seven Eight~~ Nine



Another late-night shift. Most people would fight to get out of anything later than ten, but I enjoyed the solitude, it allowed me to think. That and the fact that most people aren’t a fan of the way I smell when I’ve been there a while.



Our gas station is small, poorly travelled and situated in the middle of nowhere Oregon. With its seclusion, my shifts consisted of basic inventory and stocking with the occasional trash run to the dumpster out back.



On my own, I could plan for whoever would eventually be dragged along to earn their minimum wage.



With the nature of the job, we had a rapid turnover, almost getting one new person each week. One thing I always got across to new people was the depression outback near the dumpsters.



Don’t want to cut anymore shifts early.



That dumpster was sort of my jurisdiction, and with the unseen hazard and lingering pungent odour, it was best for all parties that only I deal with it. Those on the day shift understood, as they’d fill a large black bag over the preceding eight hours, ready for me.



The less said the better on their part.



Our manager, almost never setting foot at our stop, allowed me to take charge, dropping me a message that I’d be seeing a new hire soon.



Patrolling the building before starting my shift, I had to shoo off any unwanted scavengers, that smell tended to attract them to the bin, but at the time I hadn’t found an eloquent solution to masking it.



Sauntering up to the front door on that unusually chilly evening, he panicked, dropping the handwritten checklist list I’d left under the counter the previous day. Walking in and greeting him, the scrawny boy in his late teens introduced himself.



“Errm, hi. I’m Lewis and it’s my first day … or night. I’m guessing your Rob?”



Nodding as I breezed past him and over to the office, he’d caught me off guard as well. It’s not very often that someone else makes it in before me.  



Carefully dropping my bag in my named locker and fixing my mannerisms, I checked over my rehearsed lines. Cracking my neck and psyching myself up I re-entered the floor and tried my hand at some small talk.



“You been up to much recently?”



Though my tone was off, he didn’t seem to notice as he struggled to meek out a requisite response.



“No not really. I’m studying, so this is just my way of earning some money on the side. What about you?”



Trying to avoid eye contact as I surveyed the shelves and jotted down the handful of empty racks, my response was cut short by the new broadcast playing on our small overhead TV.



“More remains found at a gas station on route seventeen, just outside Norfolk Virginia. Authorities are still unable to ID them at this time, though many are saying it’s connected to four other bodies found last month stretching from Georgia to Carolina.”



“Wow, another one. Mom said to be careful working late. Honestly, she didn’t want me to even get a job here, but I need new pads. Oh, sorry you were saying?”



I sighed and shook my head, giving him an overtly fake smile.



“No worries, you okay to help me with the restock after you’ve checked the register?”



Lewis nodded, rushing to count up before helping me retrieve a series of boxes from the back.



Our night went slowly, with little much to do other than mop the floors again and reorder our stock for the third time, our conversation diverted to hobbies.



It seemed he was an avid baseball fan, with him talking my ear off over the Emeralds season and his current ability. At least it was nice to not have to give a meaningful response back as he kept going. 

 

Killing a good couple of hours by that point, I was about to let him know I would be going on my break when a soft crash came from outside. I knew what it was, and I feared having a partner would stop me from keeping tabs on one of my many duties.



Thankfully Lewis wasn’t interesting in venturing out on his own.



Mirroring his startled look earlier, the conversation dropped as he hit me with a line that almost made me laugh. Something I’d not done in a while.



“What was that? You think it could be, you know … The skinner?”



Evidently, he was far too focused on some growing crime story states away, as he swiped a carton of juice from the rack.



I didn’t let him see my eye roll at that colloquially used name or his clumsy handling as I retrieved the mop.



“Its most likely a raccoon. The smell out there attracts them.”



That seemingly calmed him down a little as the cogs started turning.



“Have you tried to clean it out? I’m pretty sure my dad uses some chemical to clean our out.”



My smirk and sideways glance as I retreated to the back for my break gave him all he needed.



Allowing him to tentatively manned the front, I need to reshape and scout out the back. Sneaking out of our office door and again shooing off any unwanted critter, I made a mental note that the smell needed to be neutralised before I left.



With all that scrambling around I needed to give myself sometime to adjust.



Flicking through my checklist, something I frequently had to do at the register, I remember hearing the front doorbell.



At first, I almost rushed over, being so used to spending these hours alone, though Lewis’s jovial voice sprung to life and eased me back into my chair.



Stretching after around ten to fifteen minutes, I returned to the main floor. Rounding an isle to check on his progress, surprisingly their conversation was still going.



Two officers, buying a selection of caffeinated drinks and energy bars were in deep conversation with Lewis, though I didn’t get all the sport terminology they spouted.



Walking into frame, Lewis diverted the chatter to me.



“Hey Rob, these two officers were asking about any odd things happening around here. It’s my first night so I’ve got no idea, but you’ve been here a while. You seen anything?”



His question took me aback a little, but I held my composure and gave an adequate response.



“No nothing that you can say is odd.”



Nodding the two men looked me up and down with a quizzical stare before bidding Lewis a goodnight, leaving us with an ominous statement. 

  
"Stay safe out here, don't want to be seeing you on the news next."



Ironic, though I caught their all too familiar muffled chatter as they exited, still glancing my was as they climbed back into their vehicle. 



“Man, that guy stank.”



 “With that face, no wonder he was hiding in the back.”



Evidently Lewis caught a bit of it too.



“Don’t listen to em, some people are just dicks. Anyway, what else we got to do for the rest of the shift?”



Giving him a weak smile, we quickly got to restocking where needed and mopped another spillage, before another series of sounds peaked Lewis’s interest.



“Rob, you heard that didn’t you? I’m telling you someone could be out there. Maybe we should call those cops back?”



Honestly, I understood why he was getting worked up, but it just didn’t elicit the same response in me.



“I promise you there’s nothing out there worth getting worked up about. Let me have a look.”



Stepping through the short glass door and out onto the small car park, the night was serine. Soft chirps of insects mixed with the chill breeze rattling the surrounding pines.



Other than mine and Lewis’s car, there wasn’t another person in sight. Strolling back and standing up one of our toppled signs, I re-entered the store with a calming smile.



“See, nothing to worry about.”



Perfect timing, as those words fell from my mouth a man appeared from around the building, stepping inside.



The Caucasian man dressing in all black with his hood up was exactly the panicking image I knew Lewis would have flipped at if he’d been here on his own. Accepting that, I defensively shooed him away from the counter and took the position.



Lewis obliged but equally didn’t seem to want to leave me alone with our mysterious customer as he stepped to an adjacent rack and pretend to stock an already full shelf.



The man skulked around almost every available cooler and shelf, before grabbing a monster and paying. He didn’t speak, didn’t even look up, before slinking off into the car park.



Re-emerging from behind his isle Lewis and I watched then man walk to the other side of the road, before stopping a seemingly drinking his drink. Another ten ish minutes before he turned to the left and simply strolled down the street and out of sight.



Odd for someone to walk to the store, but I wasn’t going to judge.



Lewis obviously assumed he had bad intentions, though with some gentle persuasion and his inevitable speedy exit, the store was calm again.



With his help we managed to bag up all the trash in record time for me. In the mist of our team-up, I must have kicked up a sweat as even I caught a whiff.



Letting Lewis know I’d take the trash out in a sec, suggested he shut the rest of our cleaning supplies away, before we shut up shop. In that moment, it seemed as if a lightbulb went off in his mind before he shouted “Scrubb”.



Giving a slightly confused head-cock, he continued.



“That’s the stuff my dad uses on our bins; it’ll one hundred percent get rid of that smell.”



Giving him an uncharacteristically warm smile, I spun towards to office.



Rushing into the bathroom, it was obviously slipping. Lewis was a good kid, though I should have known he wasn’t oblivious. Maybe he was just that nice of a person, a shame.



Calling his name as I strolled out of the back, that shift had seemingly flown bye. Strange what good company does to you, though as I eyeballed the room, he was gone and so was the binbag.



My face visibly dropped, though that was the last thing on my mind. Retrieving my bag, I walked around back to the dumpsters.



In those frigid morning hours, I could see his shaking visage under the sparce exterior light. Its glow, barely illuminating him, though coupled with the warm bellows of breath and that hysterical stare, he’d obviously seen.



Trembling as his voice cracked, he fully turned to face me.



“Rob there are bodies in there. I didn’t mean to throw the bag in so hard, but the bottom gave way and there were…”



His mind must have clicked, seeing my expressionless face and the Ruger in my right hand. It wasn’t like anyone was going to hear us. That thick grove of trees dampening most echoes to a quiet whisper.



It’s a shame, I almost considered allowing him to enjoy his commute home, but my demeanour had slipped. I’d been making do with this face for longer than I’d have liked, so why not a change.



No amount of cleaning agents can wash the rot away fully, and he was a perfect fit. Thanks to his suggestion, that chemical solution worked a treat. No more issues of smell next time.



He had a bit of cash, so that at least got me out of state. Lets se how long I can last this time.



Looks like I’m going to have to change this title again. Double digits, that’s a first.
