“Oi! Nice nails gay boy!” The little kid in a blue hoodie shouted at me from across the road. He had a small freckled face and red hair peaking out from his hood.

“Your mum shags for milk tokens, you little ginger chav!” I yelled back, flashing my two fingers at him.

There was a pause between us while we stared at each other from either side of the road,  before the kid ran across it, narrowly avoiding being run over by a motorbike. The kid was my cousin, Logan. He stood in front of me with an impish eager grin.

“You’re not meant to be out this late kid.” I gestured to the dark star-less sky above as we stood under the dim yellowy light of the street lamp.

“Says who?” He replied haughtily.

I scoffed. “Er says me.”

“You’re not my father.”

“So?”

“So you can’t tell me what to do.”

“I can.”

“Yeah right.” He rolled his eyes then smiled up at me. “Don’t worry I’m only going to walk Maisie back from the park.” His tone softened now that our bit was over. He had his head held up high, clearly proud to tell me about this girl.

I knew Maisie, she always helped me tidy up at the end of youth club at the local church on Wednesdays. I’m not religious, I just help out because my friend asked me to.

“Ooooo.” I taunted him and gave him a little shove.

“Laugh at me all you want. You’re just jealous. Maybe if you didn’t go around dressed like a gay emo you’d have a girlfriend as well.” He had a point there, I can’t lie.

“Oh I didn’t realise she was your girlfriend.” I opened my wallet and handed him a fiver. “Take her somewhere nice. Like the corner shop that has the bakery section in it or something.”

“Ha. Ha. You laugh but she’d love that. She really likes doughnuts. Thanks Chris.” He shoved the fiver haphazardly into his pocket then saluted me goodbye. Then he turned away from me. I watched him put his hands in his pockets the way older boys did. I assume it was an attempt to look intimidating. But no twelve year old can really look intimidating even if that twelve year old is taller than average. Even if they were the tallest in their class. A fact he loved to point out.

“See you later Logan!” I called after him. He waved again without turning around. Then I watched him disappear around the corner of a decaying garden fence. And in an instant he was out of my life forever.

I should’ve gone with him. I don’t know why I didn’t. I feel like it's sort of a universal feeling that you hate the version of yourself that existed in the near past. The version of you that made shitty decisions that to current you make no sense. Instead of walking my cousin and his little girlfriend home, I went to go check on Logan’s Mum. My Auntie Amber. Who, contrary to my previous jibe, does not and never has engaged in sex work in exchange for tokens provided by the government’s “Healthy start” initive that can be exchanged for milk. She will however, according to local legend, shag for half a gram. Hence the nickname “Half a gram Am.” Logan usually stayed out if there was a man at home he didn’t like or a new one he didn’t know yet. Hence why I went to check in.

I love Auntie Amber anyway. She wasn’t a bad mum to Logan, not really. I liked going to her house because it was always clean and tidy. Even if the place was decorated in silver plush velvet and English bulldog AI generated posters, it was tidy, warm and smelled nice. Unlike my house where we never had the heating on and my three siblings were always making a mess as they moved like a whirlwind through the house. I swear my Mum followed the kids around all day with a bottle of Aldi's own surface cleaner and a rag and yet the house was always a tip. And yes I did help out when I wasn’t at work.

“Oh hello love.” Auntie Amber greeted me at the door in her matching baby pink pyjama set and robe.

“You got anyone over tonight?” I asked her, trying to peek into the front room behind her.

“Oh just Derek. Why?” She said the name as if I’d have a single clue who Derek was.

“Just didn’t wanna intrude.”

“Oh you never intrude darling go sit down.” She ushered me inside and guided me to the living room. The floral scent of her plug in air fresher was a divine reprieve from the stale air outside.

Auntie Amber made me a tea and I sat down on her sofa next to the shirtless young man. She went through boyfriends quicker than loo rolls so I didn’t bother to get to know him much.

“Alright mate?” I nodded to him, exchanging the usual pleasantries.

“Yeah you?”

“Yeah I’m alright. Bit hot today innit?”

“Bloody boiling.”

“Evidently.” I gestured to his shirtlessness.

“What brings you here then? Not that I’m not always delighted to see my lovely successful nephew.” She smiled brightly while she set a cup of tea in front of me then took a seat in her chair across from me and the shirtless man.

“Well I saw Logan wandering around. Just thought I’d let you know. And see how you were.”

“Oh he’s alright. He’s a big boy now.”

“Well…He’s still only twelve Amber.” I reminded her as I took a sip of my tea. Which was clearly a fancy name brand tea like Tetley or PG tips.

“He’s alright. He’s got his phone if he needs me.” She assured me as she got up from her chair and began milling around the room straightening things up. She always had a hard time sitting still.

“Have you got yours on you?” I asked her.

“Yeah it’s upstairs charging.”

“Right.”

Reluctantly, I stayed with her for a bit longer, letting her tell me about how well her eyebrow threading business was doing. It was doing well I must admit. She did have a talent for that sort of work. Delicate fine work like eyebrow threading always suited her. Logan inherited those fine skills and always drew the most detailed little pictures you’ve ever seen. He wanted to be a tattoo artist when he grew up. I promised to buy him a tattoo gun and practise on me when he was sixteen. I care very little for the quality of my tattoos.

Auntie Amber was also a fantastic nail and make-up artist as well. I always had her do my nails.

“Want a touch up?” She asked, looking down at my chipped black nail polish.

“Yes please. I can’t pay you today though.”

“You never have to pay me.”

I let her paint my nails. As I watched her focus on the fine details of nail painting I thought about how Logan made the same face when he concentrated. I knew because I helped him study for his tests.

When my nails were painted and dried I decided to walk round to the park to mess around on my skateboard. It was very late but I liked it better when I was sure there were no little kids around. I didn’t expect Logan to still be there as it had been about an hour since I last saw him. In my imagination he was at this girl's house. Or he was walking back from hers after having a sweet moment together at the park. Although I did think we might run into each other and was a bit disappointed when we didn’t.

Walking around my area at night is always depressing but that night felt a little extra miserable. This wasn’t the place to be a kid. I stopped on top of the bridge over the train tracks of the station and peered over the graffiti covered railings. Imagine, if you will, trying to think about the future and all its possibilities when all that you can see around you is empty little fields of plain overgrown grass, crumbling tower blocks and the dirty Thames river. Although I must say the view off of our local pier into the Thames used to be quite nice until they built an amazon warehouse on the other side. That’s the view now. Big stupid ugly modern warehouse. Like the one I work in.

I walked over to the other side of the bridge, then I crossed the road and entered the field that the park sat in the middle of, vaguely lit by street lamps. The ramps are the only actual piece of equipment that’s still usable. People's pitbulls have torn the rubber off of the swing and the zip line, and the big slide is apparently the designated park toilet. Despite there being trees at the edge of the field they still piss in the slide, wrong uns. The skate ramps are the only part of the park that's lit up at night, by the same poorly maintained street lamps dotted around my area. They give a light that's shit for deterring crime but great for taking aesthetic pictures.

If you can’t tell I’m delaying having to tell the next part via over describing my area to you.

I should’ve known something was wrong from the feeling in the air alone. It felt still and empty. Usually the park is full of sound at any time. It’s usually birds and bugs making their noises, especially the crickets in the high grass in summer. But it was silent that night. I put my skate board down on the floor and began skating back and forth. I went up the quarter pipe, then back down to the little ramp and up the big one at the other end. I did it over and over as I had done for about a decade by that point. The only sound in my ears was the rumbling of my wheels on the smooth ramp and the not so smooth concrete. I would’ve had earphones in but I didn’t have any data on my phone.

Taking a break, I stopped on the little ramp for a second and took a seat on the rail. As I looked around I spotted a new piece of graffiti on the quarter pipe. Someone had drawn a green spindly plant with white little berries on it. I had seen several similar pieces of graffiti around recently. It’s always cool when a new artist tags your area. As I was staring at the details I saw movement from the corner of my eye. A shadow flitting past. At first I thought it was a fox. I looked in the direction it came from in hopes of seeing one. I stared out into the dark empty field looking for a flash of red fur.

Then I heard a bang from under the big ramp which made me jump. My head whipped in the direction of the noise. I got up and walked toward the sound. I thought I heard some whispers as I got closer. I attributed them to maybe some crack heads or homeless people. Or homeless crack heads. I wasn’t too worried either way as I know a lot of the crack heads, homeless people, and homeless crack heads in my area. I’m related to one of them.

I saw another shadow flit off into the dark. It went too fast for me to make out a shape. My mind changed to thinking of animals again. Perhaps there was a small family of foxes feasting on an abandoned kebab under the ramp or something.

I’m stalling again but these ramps are known for their big gaps underneath. As a teenager I smoked under them all the time. I know people who lost their virginities under them, and homeless people who camp in them regularly. The space under them really isn't that big but it's plenty if you need a place to camp out. I’ve hidden from the rain in them with girls I fancied and refused to leave the park for even though it was pissing down. And when I was much smaller I played pretend games under them with my mates. We liked pretending it was a castle and the ramp above was the battlements. It’s impressive what a space can be to a child.

Never did I imagine that the ramp would become a mausoleum for my little cousin and his girlfriend. As the underside of the big ramp came into view I saw their feet. Small and upturned. A pair of trainers and a pair of flats next to each other. My eyes scanned the scene in silent abject horror as I took in the sight of their little bodies. They laid side by side, pale and lifeless, their hands almost touching but not quite.

Upon seeing my cousin laying there I screamed. Scream isn’t quite the right word. It was a guttural noise that I had no idea I was capable of making. It came from the pit of my stomach and tore my throat up on the way out.

I stood there frozen, my entire being in pure screaming panic before I finally found the strength to look away. I took out my phone and made the most pathetic, incoherent phone call 999 has ever heard. They told me to turn back and go double check if either of them were still alive. I did so. The sight which greeted me was even worse than the first. I made that same guttural scream again, this time down the phone. Which I promptly dropped as I scanned my surroundings.

Logan’s body was gone. I ran around the perimeter of the ramps desperately looking for someone with the body of a boy in their arms. The park stayed silent. I ran into the abyss of the field searching for him, tears streaming down my face so much I couldn’t see. Then I suddenly remembered that I was supposed to be checking if Maisie was alive. I sprinted back, adrenaline sending me faster on my feet than I had ever gone before. I dipped down next to her and grabbed my phone from the floor.

In a ramble of words I couldn’t keep track of. I told the lady my cousin’s body had gone and also to tell me how to check if Maisie was alive simultaneously. That threw her but props to her for figuring me out and managing to talk me through it all.

“Okay Chris I need to place your index finger and your middle finger on the side of Maise’s neck, next to her windpipe.” The polite lady's voice on the phone instructed.

“Okay.” I replied back in a whimper. With hands I could barely keep steady I brought my fingers to Maisie's neck. I did as told, applying enough pressure to bruise her, but not a single beat came from Maisie’s blood flow. Her heart had stopped. The girl’s body was drained of all the life it once possessed. As I felt around desperately for a pulse I saw, what I thought were two moles on the side of her neck. They were perfectly placed parallel to each other and a few cm apart. I pressed around near them and noticed something that made the stillness in the air feel like it made sense.

Horrified, I gasped as the moles began to ooze thick red blood. I choked on another sob. Upon Maisie's little pale neck were two canine shaped puncture wounds. They looked painful.

Suddenly, the area under the ramp was flooded with light from police cars. It blinded me for a second. As my eyes adjusted to the new fluorescent lights in my face I looked out toward the police cars and ambulance and the personnel marching towards me. There was something behind them. I wiped the tears from my eyes and looked out to the car park. At the far end, standing under a fading and flickering street lamp were three black shadows. Their features were obscured by dim light and distance. But I saw their eerily still snarling grins. The tallest shadow held a body in his arms. A small body with a tuft of curly red hair peaking out from under a hood.

My arm shot out and pointed at the figures. “There! He’s over there!” I yelled. Two officers turned and bolted in the direction. But in the split second it took them to turn, the three figures disappeared in a blur of shadow. I got up to sprint after them but two officers grabbed me. Although my entire body was shaking with adrenaline I somehow managed to tell myself the police had it under control. My instincts told me otherwise. I sort of wish I hadn’t ignored them. Instead, I co operated and let them guide me over to a cold metal bench.

As first responders walked past with Maisie's body on a stretcher, I instinctively went to grab her hand. Something fell from it and slowly floated down to the ground. Confused, I looked down at the grass beneath me. Between my feet was a business card. Curiously, I picked it up and turned it over. On it was an illustration of the same plant that had been spray painted on the ramp.
