&#x200B;

I froze for a moment as everything that had just happened processed. Alice was doing for us what she had done for Andi. She was leading them away. Greif, panic, and despair all shot through me; there was no way she would get away this time. Not with the other creature chasing her as well. And who knew how much escaping the Curator was willing to put up with, earrings or not… Images of the bad pet room flashed in my head, but they didn't stop there. Andi, bloody and on the floor. Daniel swimming backward toward the fetus creatures. Bea's eyes as she fell into the void. All of the emotions  of those lost by this journey boiled in my blood, causing a new feeling to burn to the surface. Anger.

I turned to Ethan in the dark, "Run."

I heard him grasp at his bag until he came back up with the old wind-up flashlight. He clicked it on and then took off running as I turned to the hall.

"Behind you, idiots!" I screamed at the top of my lungs before I began to run after him.

I heard the thudding stop a few rooms down, then frantic footsteps running back. At the very least, the new beast was on its way toward us. That hopefully gave Alice a chance. I wouldn't let her die for us, not after everything she had already been through. I certainly wasn't going to let anyone else die for me. Ethan caught on to what I was doing and began calling out too as I sprinted back up to him.

After that, my body went into autopilot, propelling forward as I slipped into my own head. I added finding Alice to my mental to-do list right under finding Bea. After that, we still needed to confirm the exit, then find Daniel's room again and see if he was somehow still alive. All of that was wrapped up in getting back upstairs to the others and then making it back down to the exit with no causalities. The more I pondered the list, the more impossible it seemed. There was so much to do and so many obstacles to stop us from doing them. Almost nothing so far had gone right, so why was I still so optimistic? We needed a miracle if we were going to pull this all off.

I had no clue how long we had been running before my foot connected with the first step of the staircase, but I knew the Being had been behind us the whole time, rambling and screeching its words of madness. Endlessly recounting memories of regret and pain. We had to duck and weave through halls to outpace it, and by the time we were up the steps and rushing through the door at the top, it was at the bottom. I could hear it's hulking form barreling toward us before we slammed the door in its face and instinctively went for the handle. Thank God there was a lock on it.

It shook and rattled against the force of the thing, but unlike Ethan, it wouldn't be able to break it. The two of us collapsed on the cement floor and gasped for breath. My lungs were on fire, and I didn't even want to consider the amount of mold I had inhaled while running. I unzipped my bag with aching muscles and retrieved a water bottle, downing half of it and handing the rest to Ethan. He gulped it up then together, we stood.

"Holy shit…" He choked out.

I chuckled between pants, "Yeah. Holy shit."

Once we had gathered our bearings, the two of us turned to the area ahead, a concrete hallway with a few doors on the side. It looked like a maintenance tunnel. There was another door at the end opposite us that had a small window peering into a dimly lit room. We slowly made our way to it and looked through it when we were ready. Beyond lay a parking garage that was sparsely illuminated with fluorescent lights. The place was massive, eventually giving into its dimness and fading into darkness. To my surprise, cars dotted the black asphalt, machines I hadn't seen in years. Though, they clearly hadn't been used in some time.

"Back into this nightmare," Ethan muttered. He turned to the door that the creature was still pounding on, "Alice… Do you think this is the only door up?"

"Every other floor has only had one way up and down. That's most likely the case."

"We can't just leave her locked down there."

Now that we were finally free, I wanted nothing more than to continue the mission at hand. We needed to find Bea before it was too late. Imagining her bleeding out somewhere, scared and alone physically hurt. Ethan was right, though. Leaving Alice locked down there was a death sentence.

We decided to rest for now. After all the running, we certainly needed it. We sat in the hallway for a couple hours that felt like an eternity, then after a while, the banging stopped. Thirty more minutes later, we quietly unlocked the door and prayed that Alice would find her way out. That she was still okay…

The two of us made our way back to the end of the hall. And peered through the window again, checking for danger. The coast seemed clear, nothing but the buzzing lights. However, as I scanned the room, something specific caught my attention: a slight glow coming from the left. A green glow. My heart began to beat fast as it had grown so used to doing, but this time, it wasn't out of fear; it was out of hope.

*'The moment you see that green light, then you run for it and don't slow down.'*

I placed my hand on the door and threw it open as if in a trance, then stepped inside the garage. Ethan was taken back by my sudden rashness but followed anyways. I could feel my pulse through my whole body as I rounded the corner and looked down the wall from us. Another door was set into the brick, this one with a bright green sign hanging above it. I stepped closer and time stood still as it came fully into view. The sign depicted a man running through a doorway with an arrow pointing in the same direction, and on the metal barrier itself, white letters read:

EMERGENCY EXIT

I felt it as soon as I laid my eyes on it. This was it. This was what we had been looking for the whole time. The description matched Alice's friends' dream, Mark's dream, and…

I turned to Ethan, and by the look on his face, I barely needed to ask the question, "Is this it? In your dreams, is this the…"

He swallowed, then nodded slowly. "Yeah, man… I think this is the way out."

We approached one cautious step after the next, feeling warmer and warmer with each step. By the time we were standing before the barrier, I felt safer than I ever had in the past four years. I watched as Ethan placed his hands on the door handle and pushed it in.

Light flooded in from behind, and not fluorescent, artificial light. Real, warm, life-giving sunlight. It was bright, blinding even, especially unkind to our eyes that had been away from it so long. Seeing beyond the luminescent curtain was impossible as its radiance caressed our bodies in divine comfort.

However, it slowly faded as the door again drifted lazily shut. At that, Ethan and I looked at each other, then burst into laughter at the same time. We clasped each other in arms and began to jump up and down like little children. It was real. Andi had been right. It wasn't all in vain. The exit was real. We could still save everyone. Oh gosh, Bea…

"Bea!" I cried, a smile still plastered on my face, "We need to find her fast and make sure she's okay!"

"Right! Then we go back up for the others."

"We need to be careful, though. I'm sure the house isn't going to be happy that we found its exit. Plus, it'll still be trying to get us into our rooms. Well, the rest of us. I suppose you probably don't…." I trailed off as I realized the end of my sentence. "Ethan... y-you should go."

"What?" He said, genuinely confused.

"You should leave while you can. You don't belong here, man. I don't know how but you somehow got dragged here with us. You didn't deserve to go through any of this…"

"What? Joel, no. Shut up. I'm not leaving. I'm sticking this out to the end. Whether I'm meant to be here or not, I love you all too much just to leave. If I left and not all of you made it out later, I would never forgive myself." Ethan's expression suddenly turned somber at what he had said, "Actually, Joel, you should go."

"Okay, let's not play this game. We'll be here all-"

"No, Joel, I'm serious." He said. The concern in his eyes showed he meant it. "There's something that I never told you…."

"What is it?"

He stared at me with distant sadness in his eyes, as if still reluctant to say what was on his mind. "I wasn't completely honest with you. the other night…" He started. Before he could continue, however, a voice to our left spoke, causing us to jump.

"Careful now, Ethan. You wouldn't want to taint that guiltless mind by lying, would you?" Bea purred in a sinister tone. She strolled toward us out of the darkness of the parking garage, wearing a familiar wicked grin. "Joel's right, though. You really should leave. He's the one I want anyway." she said with a wink.

Ethan stared in stunned silence, the scene catching him off guard. I could see a million emotions running through his mind at once.

Anger was the only one I felt, however, "You make a terrible Bea," I spoke through grit teeth.

The house snickered. It wasn't trying to in the first place. It just wanted to evoke pain, and it was working. Even though I knew it wasn't really her, seeing Bea's image and hearing her voice again made my heart ache.

"I meant that, Ethan. While you have been a parasite writhing around under my skin and tearing your way through my entrails, I have no use for you. I'm giving you one last opportunity to leave."

Ethan stared at the faux Bea, and I watched him shed his nerves in favor of a similar emotion to mine. He surprised me with his response, "Or what? What are you going to do? Kill me?" My stomach dropped at him challenging the immortal being in front of us, but I was confused when I noticed its face of disdain at the remark. "You can't hurt me, can you? You can't even touch me. That's why you just trapped me with the bars at the catwalk instead of killing me, isn't it?"

The shapeshifter held its glare for a second longer, then slid back into its smile, "No. You're correct, Ethan. Excellent deduction skills; I can't hurt you. But do you know who I can hurt? All of your friends. Bea, Daniel," It looked straight into my eyes, "Joel." Ethan winced at the statement. "So if I were you, I wouldn't be so full of myself. I was trying to be nice, but you're quickly wasting that kindness."

"I don't want anything from you. Let alone your kindness."

"So be it. Then you can just watch as your last friend is slowly ripped away from you."

"I won't let you take him."

The creature ignored him and turned to me again, "Oh, Joel, I could smell you so clearly down there with that *thing*, just out of reach. Your sin is so intoxicating, and it only keeps smelling more and more delicious. I was practically salivating." On cue, a few drops of water trickled down from the ceiling, splattering on the cracked, black asphalt below. "I hoped that that disgusting collector hadn't gotten to you first. It would have been such a waste. I'm so glad you found your way out, though. I can barely wait any longer. I hope you don't mind; it was taking so long for you to find your room that I took the liberty of bringing it to you. I even decided to let your new friend out of it to help me."

From the darkness behind the creature, I heard a sweet-sounding voice begin to hum out. Sweet, yet haunting. I recognized it.

"She's very excited to meet you, Joel. She's been waiting for so long. Why don't you come and say hi?"

My heart began to race as Ethan grabbed my arm, "Go."

He pushed me toward the exit door hard, and I slammed into the handle, flinging it open. I felt the warm light envelop me as I almost fell through, but I managed to catch myself on the door frame. I knew it was an easy escape, maybe even the only current option, but there was no guarantee I could get back once through. I wasn't leaving until I knew everyone was going with me, room or not. I yanked myself back inside, letting the door shut behind me as I heard the humming voice call out.

"Joel? Joel, baby, is that you?"

I turned in a panic to see where Ethan went, but all I saw was the door to the hallway we had emerged from drifting shut. He was going back downstairs.

"Ethan!" I called after him, running to the door. Out of my peripheral, I saw the embodiment of the house slip into the ground. I grabbed the door handle and was about the throw it open when it wrapped around my wrist like a snake. In front of me, a pair of yellowed eyes cracked through the metal, followed by a smile of crooked teeth. The face stretched its way out, composed of mold that morphed back into the shape of Bea as it exited. Its hand sprouted from the doorknob and forced me to the ground, then the creature pinned itself on top of me.

"Aw, don't be shy, Joel." It leaned in close to my face. "You've always been good with the ladies."

I struggled, but it was no use. A statue may as well have been built on top of me.

"Oh, Joooeeeelll?" The sinisterly sweet voice sang out with glee. I wrenched my head back to see a silhouette far across the garage moving closer. I knew who it was going to be, and I didn't want to see them.

"You should thank me, Joel. Your room is really special. Everything you ever wanted. Just you and someone to hold. No distractions, no disturbances. You'll never be alone again." Bea mocked from above me.

Suddenly the House was slammed hard with the door, hit with enough force to knock it off me. I rolled away from it and looked up to see Ethan staring first at the pissed-off house, then at me with surprise.

"Joel, what are you doing?! You need to leave-" It looked like he was going to say more, but he didn't have time.

Thudding and a familiar xylophone came from the back of the hall. I knew exactly what trick he was using. He ducked around the back of the door, and I scurried tight against the wall just in time for the Curator to come screeching through the doorway. The shapeshifter writhed its form onto its feet just in time for the Curator to spot it.

That was when it made a noise I had never heard it make before. Angry, deep, and guttural. Less like a child and more like a beast.

The house looked a combination of frustrated and scared as it tried to fall into the ground. However, faster than it could shift, the Curator grabbed the form, wrenching it back up with all its might. I didn't understand how the Creature had never been able to break the house's walls but could somehow force around its body, but there was no time to figure that answer out. The House gave up its façade and showed its true form.

Its skin dissolved and rotted into mold like it had before, however, this time, it didn't reform. At least not into any discernable figure. It twisted and writhed into a collage of different textures and objects. A mass of teeth bloated into bloodshot eyes and then hardened into a jagged drywall sculpture. A pile of plastic dolls melted together then squelched into a skittering, crunching mass of beetles. The only constant was its eyes, almost human with their tiny black pupils and yellow tint. It grew itself large to match its opponent's size and then opened its mouth that had been buried beneath the mold.

Have you ever heard a stone cutter slicing through concrete? I had one time walking past a construction site before I ended up at the house. It's a shrill noise, the sound of metal trying to cut through stone. It's otherworldly in pitch, making your teeth hurt from how loud it is. It's not even close to how the House's screech sounded, but it's still the nearest comparison I can put into words.

The Curator and the House began violently thrashing about the area, slamming into cars and support pillars. All the while, the silhouette on the other side of the garage grew closer, humming the whole way. I knew I could make out the details if I looked closer, but I pulled my gaze away. With all the madness, I thought the simple sight might be enough to break me.

Suddenly the sound of glass shattering jarred me back to reality. I looked up to see Ethan reaching into a box on the wall, one we hadn't noticed coming in. It was an emergency fire axe. He yanked it from the locks and held it tight in his hands.

"You need to get out of here, Joel!" He yelled over the chaos.

"I'm not leaving, Ethan! We need to find Bea!"

"Fine, we really don't have time to argue. We need to get around them and-"

Out of my peripheral, the humming woman stopped, "Joel? Who's that you're with?" I heard her call out. She didn't sound as happy as she had before.

"Just run," Ethan said, cutting his plan short.

The woman lowered onto all fours as we took off, and I heard her speak again. "Baby, hang on! Don't leave! I'm all you need, honey!" Like a demented cat, I watched her begin to sprint toward us, the sound of long nails clattering across the concrete. That was when I had no choice but to look at her.

From what I could tell, she was nude, and her skin was pale and ghost white. Her hair was a tangled and ratted mess that flailed violently at her inhuman movements, and her limbs were oddly proportioned while still human in nature. Despite all the uncanny details, her face was unmistakable; the House made sure of it. She wore a smile the same as the night I had ruined everything. She looked just like Sarah.

Her speed was unbelievable, and in a flash, she was already halfway across the lot. Panicked, I called out for Ethan, but he wasn't the only thing that heard it. The Curator perked up its head and let out a screech, laying a quick blow into the shapeshifter to stun it before sprinting toward the woman.

"My pets!" It squealed as it plowed her over from the side. I didn't bother to keep watching to see what would happen next.

Another wall came into view as we ran, and on it, I could make out two elevator doors. The house had already made it clear that whatever door led out of here was attached to my room, which meant that the only option we had was back downstairs or trying the lifts and hoping they still functioned.

"Over there!" I called to Ethan before winding up face down on the asphalt. I turned around to see the floor had risen up to encase my foot. It radiated with pain at how it had just been twisted. The shifter rose up in front of me, looking like Him and wearing a furious face.

"Do you ever get tired of running, Joel? Seems like it's all you ever do."

More concrete rose from the ground and encased my hand, crushing hard against it. I let out a pained grunt that made the thing smile before-

*THWACK!*

The house let out another shrill scream as it shot through several forms rapidly. The structure encasing me melted away, and I backed up to see what had happened. Ethan had sunk the axe a good few inches into its back.

It turned angrily toward him, but this only allowed him to remove the weapon easier and re-sink it directly into its chest. He ripped it out again, sending bits of moldy flesh into the air as the being writhed in pain, clearly not used to such a feeling. The Curator heard the commotion and must have thought we were the ones being attacked because it changed targets again, pouncing off Sarah's twisted image and catching the shapeshifter before it tried again to sink into the floor to safety. I stood up and prepared to run again, but Ethan didn't move. Instead, he raised the axe again as the Curator held the Houses body in place.

*THWACK!*

I looked back to see that my room's creature was getting back up from the assault she had suffered.

"Ethan, Let's go!" I cried.

"I can kill it!" He shot back, tearing chunks of wood and meat from the everchanging mass. He was so close to the Curator that I expected it to grab him, but it didn't. Instead, it just held the screeching demon in place, like it understood what Ethan was doing.

*THWACK!*

This time, as debris from its body tore away, a gaping hole was left behind. Within, I didn't quite understand what I saw. It was a heart, purple and dead, yet beating. No matter how the mass changed, the hole remained with the organ inside. Ethan stared at it with as much disbelief as me and, after slight hesitation, raised the axe to deal the final blow.

*CRACK!*

It took me a moment before my shocked brain could process what had just happened. when it finally did, my legs went weak, and I stumbled to the ground.

Before Ethan could swing the axe down, the House let out one final loud screech. It bulked its form and grabbed the curator with all of its might, lifting it over its head and throwing it down in front itself. It landed right on Ethan with a sickening…

"Ethan!" I screamed so loud it could have rivaled the monsters around me.

The thing from downstairs scrambled to its feet, then looked down when it noticed Ethan. He lay on the concrete breathing shakily, the axe he intended to swing lying somewhere beneath him. I saw blood pooling slowly around his form as I just stared in shock.

The curator brushed him gently with a finger, "E-Ethan?" It asked softly in its high-pitched voice.

Ethan didn't react. He just stared up at the ceiling and continued his labored breathing. The Curator's aura went from confused to blistering rage as it slowly raised its head to the body of the House that was slowly recovering from the assault of blows it had been dealt. It lunged forward with another angry cry, but the house was quick enough to evade this time. It reappeared behind the Curator, slamming hard into its back and knocking it to the ground. The thing that looked like Sarah analyzed her priorities and decided to eliminate the threat first, running over to help the House. I didn't move, though. I just continued to stare at my best friend bleeding out on the concrete.

Slowly and painfully, I walked on my knees across the lot to him.

"Ethan? E-Ethan, come on. Get up. We need t-to go."

"Joel?" He gasped, turning his head to me. The air he was breathing sounded easier coming out than going in.

"Shh, stop- just don't talk. Ethan, we need.. We need to… What do I… I don't know what to do. Ethan, I don't know what to do—"

"Joel… I'm sorry, Joel."

"No. No. Don't apologize. You didn't do anything wrong. You did so well. Come on, let's go get Bea. We need to find Bea."

"No, Joel, I… I lied to you…"

"What? What are you talking about, man? Come on, get up. You just got the wind knocked out of you is all." Behind me, I heard the Curator let out what I could only assume was a scream of pain, but I didn't bother to look.

"I lied to you… Back at the enclosure… there was more to the dream, Joel… There was one more death…."

"No, stop it! You aren't going to die! Please, Ethan… Please get up…."

"No, Joel… Not me… The house… I thought I could stop it, but-" He let out a labored cough that brought up blood. "I dreamt that you died, Joel… The house kills you… I don't know how or when, but… I see it looming over your dead body."

The sentence was enough to finally snap me out of my denial, "W-what?"

"I'm so sorry… I thought I could protect you… I wanted to protect you…."

Silent tears began to fall from my eyes as I looked down at my friend. Behind me, I heard another scream from the Curator, then heard steps galloping away. They sounded limp and injured.

"No, Ethan you… Ethan, I don't… I don't know what to do…."

"Find Bea… Get Everyone home…."

"No, Ethan, please. I can't do this without you. Please don't leave me."

He didn't respond. He just stared at me and continued trying to breathe.

I grabbed his hand tightly and leaned close, "Please… Please, brother… don't leave me… Don't leave me all alone…."

I prayed that he would answer, but he never did. Unlike with Bea and Daniel, I had to watch as the life faded from Ethan's eyes. I folded in half and collapsed onto his chest as tears silently poured from my eyes.

"Please… Please…"

"He's all yours." I heard the house say behind me in Bea's voice. I didn't turn around, however. I just held on to Ethan, feeling what little warmth his body still had.

"Joel, Baby?" The woman said in her sickly-sweet voice. I felt her hand rest on my shoulder, her nails like knives against the fabric of my jacket. "Aw, honey, don't cry. I know you're sad about your friend, but you didn't need him anymore." she leaned in close and let her cold breath brush against my ear. "I'm all you need now."

She slid her hand down my arm and grabbed mine out of Ethan's. As she did, her nails sunk deep into my skin. I hardly winced, however. I didn't care. I didn't have any energy left to care. I didn't have any strength left to fight. I didn't have anything anymore...

The woman who looked like Sarah began to lead me across the garage to an open doorway in the distance. The doorway to my room. As we walked, I took one last look back at Ethan. From so far away, he almost looked like he was sleeping. Maybe he was. Maybe he was just a little hurt. All he needed was some rest to heal up. Yeah-- that was it. And then he could come to save me. He could come to save all of us.

&#x200B;

Grace and I removed the bits of gum from our mouths and squished them onto the back of the paper. She lifted the canvas to the wall and held it down for a few seconds until it stuck. Together, we stood back and stared up at the painting.

"Peaceful." She spoke.

"Huh?"

"Peaceful. That's what I think it feels like."

"Yeah? Just in general?"

"Sure. If you think about it, a quick death would be just that. You die before you've even realized it. But I'd think that even with the most painful death, there'd come the point when your body shuts down. Close to the end, I mean. Only your brain is still functioning, and at that moment, there'd be nothing left to worry about. Just a last breath as you slip on to whatever comes next. Maybe that sounds scary to some, but I find that thought peaceful."

"I don't think that sounds scary. I think you're right." I said, staring up at the Cardinals. "I think that sounds nice."
