I mad-dashed through the woods. Tripping, scraping, and slamming into twisted, dense foliage. I couldn’t think over my own loud breathing. It vibrated through my whole body. Deafening. Then something slammed into me and sent me colliding into a tree. I fell to the dirt, everything around me blurry. I was bleeding all over but didn’t know from where. A large silhouette loomed over me.

I then woke up. That was the nightmare I had right before the incident. At the time, it felt real and shook me up a bit. But I was already shaken up pretty bad. My dog… my best friend died two weeks ago and I wasn’t even close to recovering.

At that time, Jet was my family. She was 14. She had a good life and was well taken care of. My wife and I never had kids, so Jet was our baby. I was married

but my wife died two years ago. 

I will never 

recover

from 

that... 

I lay there in bed, not wanting to get up. I was kind of in this coma like depression for days. I didn’t want to do anything but lie in bed and watch anything that would make me forget for at least a little while. 

I was expected to go back to work next week. I really didn’t know how that would happen and was debating on just quitting. But that was for my future self to deal with. 

I had an anniversary to focus on. So, I dragged my bag of bones out of bed.

I picked up Jet’s ashes from the crematorium I took her to. She was a 50-pound Blue Heeler. I went home and divided up her ashes into two. One would stay at the place. The other was coming with me on my trip.

I then packed up my small SUV and drove off into the deep wilderness. The city we lived in was at the edge of a massive forest. Some of it BLM land (Bureau of Land Management), some of it private, some of it federal park. It was a giant patchwork that went for hundreds of miles.

It took me about three hours to get to where I wanted to get. It was a very off-grid campsite on BLM land. Jet’s favorite place on the planet. At least that’s what my impression always was. We would come here with my wife. Those were really good times.

It was only a thirty-yard walk from parking my car to the campsite. I set up a small fire pit and a tent. I was planning on only staying one night. 

Three years back on the day, before Emma died, the sky was gorgeous with stars and there was an epic meteor shower. As my wife and I sat there watching this beautiful celestial show, Jet sat next to us and watched as well. The three of us sat there for hours star gazing. My wife and I wood hoot and holler and Jet would bark at the best shooting stars.
  
So, I was going to wait until it got dark to spread Jet’s ashes there along with a little bit of my wife’s. 

I brought with me a cot, some food, and my revolver with dozens of rounds. I was out in the middle of nowhere with the closest ranger station being over 200 miles away. There were grizzlies and mountain lions in the nearby hills but I was always more worried about the people who didn’t want to be found. 

Maybe I was becoming one of them. I was having lots of thoughts about my purpose in life. And if I even wanted to be on the planet anymore. I lost my parents a while back. Not because they died but because they were a-holes. One was a narcissist dick, the other was a manipulating witch. One of the best things I ever did in my life was cut them off. But now I truly had nobody. All my grandparents had died when I was young and my parents stopped talking to their siblings and cousins decades ago. It was as if they wanted our lineage to end. I had a f’d up family. Emma and Jet were everything to me. Emma lost her parents when she was young. I had some friends. My best friend moved across the country for a job last year. 

You could say that I was in a very dark space…

That night I ate, drank and watched the stars. I then spread Jet’s and Emma’s ashes. I won’t lie… I cried a lot. At one point, it seemed like I was a volcano. For the last few days before, I hadn’t been crying. But for the past few months, I had cried every day since I found out about Jet’s aggressive cancer. I think I was pent up and ready to explode.

It did help me go to sleep that night. That and a liter of Jack Daniels.

I can’t remember now if I woke up and heard it or if it woke me up. But I heard the smashing of glass. It came from where my car was and sounded like a windshield breaking. I then heard a loud bang. 
It was like something heavy hitting the metal on the SUV and denting it. Neither sounded good. 

The sounds were relentless. It was like someone was bombarding my car. More glass shattered. 

I grabbed my gun and peeked out of the tent. There was a half-moon in the sky so it wasn’t pitch dark but I couldn’t see much in the shadows of the forest canopy. My campfire was completely dead as I had extinguished it.

I kept hearing my car being under siege. I thought of two options, firing my gun into the sky or moving closer and try to see more. I then fired my gun into the air. POP. POP. POP. I quickly reloaded my five chamber. I grabbed a handful of bullets and put them in my pocket and grabbed my phone.

The noise at my car stopped. I stood there quietly inside my tent but my head, gun and camera peeking out. I scanned the area with both my eyes and lens. An eerie silence spread over the murky land. There was not a sound in the air.

I then heard a creak.

Something whizzed by my head. Loud and fast. 

I then heard another and it dawned on me that something was throwing things at me.

And that’s when I got nailed in the shoulder. I fell back into the tent. My shoulder on fire. I saw what hit me as it rolled across the tent. It was a rock around the size of a baseball.

My phone was on the ground next to it completely shattered.

I then heard footsteps outside. Something was charging my tent.

It was the adrenaline that gave me the kick. I got up, went to the opening, and looked out. A hairy, humanoid shadow was sprinting at me. I fired off three rounds right at him. I think one landed. I was a pretty good shot as I’d go regularly to a shooting range. 

The human-like something changed course and dashed into some nearby bushes.
 
It stayed there, in a dense patch of green shadows. But then a rock ripped out of the darkness at me. I moved and I think it barely missed my face as it zipped past my ear like a humming bird.

I fired my last two rounds at the spot. Then quickly reloaded and fired off five more. I reloaded and waited, watching the shrubs and bushes sway slightly in the wind. Their branches clicking.
 
Nothing else moved for what seemed like an eternity.

I then said, “who are you?” I know that’s so lame but I think that’s pretty much all I said over and over again. I was focused on the shadows.

But then I heard this awful sound come from there. It wasn’t human but it also wasn’t animal. It was a cry. It then cried out louder. 

That’s when I heard another cry in the forest. A deeper one. But then the beast closer to me stopped. The cry from the distant forest rang out again. But the one nearby didn’t respond. Again the distant cry came but more distraught. 

The only reply it got was two other distant, different cries. I realized that there was at least three more of these things and that they were all around me. 

I knew I had to get the hell out of there. I put on my shoes and readied a backpack as fast as possible. I thought about going to my car. The unresponsive beast was right between my tent and my car. 
Nonetheless, I was going for it. But then I hesitated as I thought it could be a trap. The absurdity of the moment gripped me… all my life I wanted to see a Bigfoot and now I was being attacked by them… the universe really just wanted to end me and maybe I should have taken the clue right there…

Instead, I scooped up my busted phone and took it with me even though its screen was shattered. I readied my gun and ran to my car. As I moved past the bushes, I saw the thing sprawled on the ground. Even though its fur was dark, I could see it was very wet on the chest. It was red blood. The thing didn’t move.

I broke in my tracks. Crazy as it sounds, I had to get a better look as I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. The beast must have been a wretched, missing link. It had dark brown fur. Was over 6 feet tall and 220 pounds. It was lean but muscular. Had long arms, a thick brow, and a Gorilla’s snout. It didn’t move at all. I was pretty sure it was dead.

I tried to use my phone as I could tell it was still powered on. I tried double clicking the side which would auto bring up the camera mode. I hit the screen, hoping that maybe my phone would get one good pic as the camera lens wasn’t cracked.

A terrifying howl ripped through the night like thunder. It came from nearby.

I turned and saw a larger beast’s silhouette about 15 yards away. 

It was next to my vehicle and was seemingly staring at me. 

I stood frozen. I remember clenching my gun so tight that my nails punctured my flesh. The thing then ran like a giant ape and flipped my car over. The funny thing about this was at that moment, I remember thinking that Emma and I should have really bought the one I wanted – a much heavier Ford Bronco.

I fired my gun into the air. All five rounds. The thing froze and watched me like a statue. 

I quickly reloaded. I then heard two other beasts coming out of the woods at me. I was in the process of reloading and dropped a few bullets.

I thought about firing on them, but they were surrounding me. I had one opening to escape. Something whizzed by my head –

So, I mad dashed into denser woods. Thankfully, it was flat land. 
The beasts were right behind me. I bolted a good fifty to sixty yards, I was somehow pulling away from them, but my cardio was shit at that time. I knew if I had to keep running I’d be done for.
 
One of them was faster than the others. It kept getting closer and I would fire on it and it would quickly dodge behind trees. I could hear rocks whistling around me. I think one hit me in the back but my backpack absorbed it.

I then got to the edge of a large pool of water tangled with tall grass.

I stayed on the edge of this murky wetlands and continued to run. I heard the beasts shriek while they chased me. 

They kept throwing rocks. I wildly fired my gun back at them. I never could get a clean shot as one was always hurling rocks or flanking me. Their pace was increasing as mine was slowing. 

One must have picked up a handful of smaller rocks as I felt them pelt me.

As they closed in, I then plunged into the bog, knee deep. The water’s edge was a thick murky soup. Clearer water lay deeper away.

Agitated and shrieking, the beasts stayed on the water’s edge. They threw rocks as I quickly wadded towards deeper water and fired at them.

The beasts then jumped in. I tucked my gun, tossed my back pack off, and dove into deeper water and swam my heart out. I swam a lot when I was a kid. I got to land on the other side and scrambled out of the pond.

I instantly realized my gun was gone. It must have fallen loose.

The beasts emerged from the bog right behind me. I bolted through darker, denser wetlands, dodging and ducking branches, leaping over soggy shrubs.

I slipped and fell down a crevice. I slammed against a fallen tree where a decomposing enormous tree had fallen. Other fallen trees lay across it, lodged into the land and creating a hollow underneath. A tight crawl space to hide in. 

I quickly climbed down into the hollow. Inside, I squeezed into the small cave made of sludge, soil, and twisted roots. I went quiet A.F.

I heard the beasts enter the area. At least two of them. They slowed down. I heard their steps breaking branches as they seemed to be moving closer to the fallen trees and the hollow I was inside. 

I peeked out and saw one of them approaching, less than ten feet away. Not wanting to be trapped, I quickly slid-tumbled out of the hollow and hid behind another decomposing tree.

I thought for sure that the beast saw me. I hid in a patch of ferns. But it didn’t see me. 

I watched it look into the hollow and even crawl inside a bit. The other beast scanned the area and I thought our eyes locked for a moment. I closed my eyes and lay still in the mud.

I was covered in slimy muck and hoped that I blended into the land. 

I heard the beast slowly move towards me. One stealthy step... then another… barely making a sound. But I knew it was there. I kept my eyes closed and my cheek planted in the soil.

The beast kept moving towards me. I then heard the other beast enter my vicinity. They seemed to be on each side of me and closing in. As they moved towards me, I thought about popping up and bolting away...

But then something else struck me. Did I even care to die? I had contemplated this question since Emma crossed over. But Jet was then my reason to keep going, to take care of her. But then when she left me…

I thought about just standing up and letting them rip me apart. Tearing me limb from limb. Or smashing my skull with a giant rock. Maybe it would be fast. Maybe it would be slow and terrible… I didn’t really know if I cared…

I then heard the loud crack of a branch breaking under a heavy weight and realized the beasts were right next to me. I peeked open an eye and saw a big, matted hairy foot right in front of my face.

I was just about to get up and accept my fate.

But then, as if she were right there over my shoulder, I swear to everything that is holy to me, that I heard Emma’s voice say, “stay.” 

When I heard it, I froze solid as stone.

Strange sounds came from the beasts. It was as if the two beasts were talking to each other. I heard the beasts sniffing. They made more odd noises, grunting and growling. Then one shrieked. Then the other one. I tried not to move.

They were both right f'ing next to me.

I was holding my breath... 

But couldn’t much longer...
 
They were going to see me...

It was going to happen soon...

Time stopped!  I thought I was done for and would be joining Emma and Jet… and it filled me with joy… so much joy…

But then the beasts 

ran off. 

I heard their footsteps fade deeper and deeper away. 

I was still holding my breath... a long moment went by... the wind rustled some trees, but I didn’t hear anything else.

I opened my eyes. I realized just how well I blended in with the land. My whole body was covered in thick muck. When I slid into this spot, the muddy dirt and plants smooshed over me. 

I then quickly scrambled back to the hollow and climbed in, squeezing all the way inside. It was easy because I was so slimed up. I tried to get comfortable which didn’t seem possible in the mushy, peat pit.

I didn’t sleep. My body in a daze. My mind racing. All I could think about was why did I live? Did Emma speak to me? Was it just my mind playing tricks? Why was I so alone and left to miss them so much? Why couldn’t I have just died and joined them? 

When the early morning sun shined across the hollow, I peeked out. Birds were chirping. The forest looked beautiful and peaceful.

I made my way out of the hollow. Crouched down low, expecting the beasts. But none appeared.

I knew there was a gas station I had passed that was south of my campsite. It was around 200 miles away. I used the sun to navigate south and began to walk. Always anticipating that I could get attacked at any moment.

It took me 6 days of sustaining on berries and creek water. And 6 nights of sleeping in creepy, forest crawl spaces. I thought for sure a snake, nasty spider or bear would get me instead of Bigfoot or dehydration. 

Somehow, I made it to the highway and eventually the gas station. 	

My feet were destroyed. I had blisters on top of blisters. Bruises on top of bruises. I felt like some bones were broken in my foot and maybe ribs. My muscles were cramped and swollen. I was a complete mess both physically and emotionally.

I was a lost man who decided to keep living…

I told two Forest Rangers my story. They gave me their full .attention as I must have been entertaining as hell. This crazy man covered in dry mud and berries, out there in no man’s land to spread my family’s ashes on some sentimental journey. They wrote everything down and just said, “we’ll investigate and see what we find.” I don’t know if they believed me. I did feel like one was holding something back. The other, much older, ranger seemed to be keeping her in check.

I still had my phone, but it was completely destroyed. I took it to a tech guy who was able to access its hard drive but there were no pictures there.

The ranger followed up with me a few days later saying they found my campsite, overturned vehicle, and empty liquor bottles. They didn’t find any body or even traces of blood anywhere.  

He insinuated that I may have been incredibly distraught and heavily intoxicated because of my loss and perhaps drove drunk and flipped my own car over. And maybe I was a bit delusional. Perhaps even concussed.

I didn’t argue or fight back. It did sound crazy. I didn’t care if they believed me. I know what I experienced.

I’m currently sitting in my terribly empty apartment right now, listening to the noise of the city outside.

I needed to share this story with others as I’m truly lost and don’t know what to do next…
