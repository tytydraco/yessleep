Welcome To My First Entry.

My Name Is Uragi. I'm around 5'9 and I have worked in Facility Geno for about 4 years. I'm in my early 30s and I'm male. I won't disclose my last name though, I hope you understand.

 

I used to work for SUU; The Supernatural Utilization Unit. The Unit was made when Miridia was in charge. She was the previous boss around here before she...well, nobody really knows except for the Executives.

The Executives are a group of 5 who are in charge of the government facility me and my co-workers get a living from. Well, they are kinda in charge but they leave all the work and stuff for the Boss. Nowadays the Executives just announce new Bosses and suggest ideas to the current Boss. 

The Boss is only in charge of creating and getting rid of Units along with making Rules and Guidelines that the Executives approve of. They also are supposed to make sure the units do their job but even though the Boss has a lot of power, they have to make and destroy Units based on 3 factors:

Base Function: The Base Function is the main reason why the facility I work at was created, this one being to deal with the Supernatural or... "Monsters" as many others call them.

Productivity: How well the Unit is doing at its assigned job (Example: Utilizing The Supernatural).

Worker Count: How Much variety in talent is needed for the unit and how many workers are needed.

These 3 factors determine if a unit is created or destroyed.

Now I don't wanna bore you all so I'll just get to the point.

The Current Boss; Landon, decided it would be a bright idea to switch me to the SDU; The Supernatural Destruction Unit. Yup...possibly the worst thing that could happen to me since...never mind; it's not worth explaining.

So yea, I got all my stuff in a bunch of boxes and had to move to a new Unit with a bunch of random people who I never got to meet since they are on field missions most of the time.

&#x200B;

I entered the SDU Office and I gotta say, the main room we worked in was kinda empty... The walls had nothing on them and the desks just had some paper and a pen with a couple drawers that were locked. The room was a dull grey with a white ceiling and a single light in the middle of the room which was cracked. This unit looked like it was barely funded but I bet that's about to change since Landon is the opposite of Miridia, he hates anything that isn't natural.

I'm not gonna preach for equal rights and stuff for the supernatural but some of them are just...I don't know. One time I met a girl who had telepathic powers that wasn't even crazy strong, just enough to lift around 100 pounds...or was it 110? I forgot, but she was dealt with as if she was some kind of bomb that would go off any minute she wasn't kept monitored or being tested on.

The SUU never preached to help any of the supernatural, the best we did was treat them as best we could and see if they could be helpful to people. The girl was deemed dangerous because well, she wasn't that old and she went into a fit of rage when she was being bossed around by some of the guards. They probably were teasing her but that's just a guess on my part. 

The helpful ones were usually recruited at other Facilities that trained or even used the supernatural for who knows what. The dangerous ones...were terminated. Miridia wanted to change that but we didn't have anywhere to put them with the funding we were getting. 

I saw a couple rooms in the back which were the living quarters... which had 9 beds, 7 of them looked used and 2 of them looked dusty and as if it hasn't been used in a good while. I took the empty bed on the left which was near the only window in the Office but it was better than staring at grey, empty walls.

I unpacked my only possessions at the facility which included my 18 Oz water bottle, A Book from the government which had a documentation of every supernatural being ever found and my wallet. I also had clothing designed for the SDU that I set aside to deal with later.

It was currently 3:02 in the afternoon and I had 28 minutes until the other members of the SDU got back from whatever field mission they were doing so I decided to snoop around at the papers I saw earlier.

Not finding much, I sighed and pushed myself across the room in the swivel seat I was sitting in. Eventually I just decided to go on my phone and text Jasper, my co-worker and friend from the SUU.

Hello -MistAlt0I (Me) (3:27)

Hey, How has the SDU been?  -Casper808 (Jasper) (3:27)

I just unpacked -MistAlt0I (3:27)

Did you meet the other members or nah? -Casper808 (3:28)

No thats at 3:30 -MistAlt0I (3:28)

Ight, So how's the Office? I bet it's filled with high tech weapons. -Casper808 (3:28)

It's emptier than Landon's soul. -MistAlt0I (3:28)

Yea didn't you talk to him earlier? -Casper808 (3:28)

He doesn't seem that bad. -Casper808 (3:29)

Did you NOT see the way he was looking at the monsters in some of the cells? -MistAlt0I (3:29)

Yea cuz staring at monsters means he's some heartless prick? -Casper808 (3:29)

I'm telling you Landon is gonna make this place 10 times worse before someone else replaces him -MistAlt0I (3:29)

You're being a hypocrite, We got a really good boss last time so why would it change this time? -Casper808 (3:29)

I went to respond but I was jolted from my phone by the sound of the door being unlocked.

I quickly turned as the 7 members of the SDU walked in.

The first one that walked in had a name tag on his suit which read "Chris". He was white and had a full head of white hair but didn't have many wrinkles. He had brown eyes and carried in a bunch of bags filled with who knows what.

The second one that walked in also had a name tag which read "Sophia". She's a red head but surprisingly had short hair. She had tan skin and She wore a trench coat unlike everyone else who had similar uniforms to what I had been given. She gave a stern look to someone behind her and then turned to me and rolled her eyes at me as if this wasn't the first time she had to deal with a new member.

The third and fourth members walked in, their names were "Sebastian" and "Cole" who both had brown hair, Sebastian was white and Cole had a dark brown skin tone. They both brought in heavy bags with guns and other weapons inside. Sebastian had blue eyes and Cole had grey eyes.

The fifth and sixth members walked in after, one of them named "Micheal" and the other named "Dylan", one of them was carrying a bunch of bags and the other only carried in a map, Dylan, who was probably the driver.

The final member was...A Dog. I was surprised that a dog was a member and not just counted as a pet but I wouldn't be surprised if this dog was specially trained or something. The Dog was a German Shepherd with a light yellow collar. I walked over and looked at the Collar which read "Property of FG:SDU" and "Apollo".

As I looked at the collar Cole walked up to me and asked me if I was the new member.

"Oh, Yea. Nice to meet you". I said with the friendliest tone I could muster which wasn't that friendly and made me sound more nervous than anything. I reached out my hand and Cole shook it firmly.

"Hey, you mind putting this in the drawer labelled #4 for me"? Cole asked and dropped the heavy bag with guns and weapons into my arms and I almost fell forward.

"Sure thing...". I said, slightly annoyed as I walked over to the drawer labelled #4 which looked more like a cabinet than a drawer and opened it, revealing its spacious inside. I carefully placed the bag of weapons inside and closed the drawer.

Everyone in the room had already began putting everything away and I watched as Micheal typed in a code behind the entrance door which I didn't notice and watched in amazement as the grey empty walls were replaced with interactive 2D holograms.

Chris put the dog in a crate and then turned to me. "Get off that damn phone and come over here". He  demanded.

I quickly finished typing this out and decided to go see what he wanted. I'll post again later when I don't have my co-workers breathing down my back the moment I'm not working.  

\-see ya.
