It is with great sadness I recount such events; that such timid behaviors could result in a knowledge that is so catastrophic hardly seems it could belong to a family line that I am part of.  

But I always was a cuckoo’s child, so it makes a bit of sense that I was to remain ignorant of it.  

In the year 1955 my great grandfather and grandmother Henrietta and James Greyfallow got married. They of course were related, second cousins

 But even as I scan the vague photos such a queer unease surrounds them, the monuments that decorated the halls were ones I had never seen before or since.

They varied in shape so much that it would take too much time to remember and describe them but one that struck me the most was this one that had great grey horns and the face of a dragon, eyes deep black despite the statue otherwise being made of white marble. Even through the picture I could feel its eyes meeting mine.  

My mother alleged they were the true shape of the angels. But if it was something truly benign, I wouldn’t have had words to write.  

Another thing; the people at the wedding were dressed in long black robes with their faces hidden, and each held a flame rather than something like flowers.  

Following their marriage they moved into a seaside town; this was a place I'd visited in my childhood many times and each time I did so it was most unsettling; there never seemed to be more than a handful of people out despite the town’s circumference being quite large.  

Each time we crossed them they always smiled at us, my young mind perceived them as mocking but now that I have had time to reflect on these memories it almost seems like they were giddy or eager.  

The town also had this queer ability to shift, one shop would be in another place, a street would be there that wasn’t there before; at one point I remember walking in between two buildings and there was a room that shouldn’t be there between them.  

Its width was greater than the space that should have held it and yet it fit comfortably between two buildings, there was no curve to the buildings it was between and by all means the edges should’ve cut into it. But...how do I describe it? 

 

 The edges were visible all the way to the ground and so were the walls of the room, there was nothing making its way for it, though there should’ve been. I know this isn’t easy to visualize and it's hard to explain, but it was the first hint about this town that I began to perceive as unordinary. 

After their marriage they had two children, my uncle John and my mother Alexandria. In the year 1975 my uncle would take his own life; he’d break into a public pool with a gallon of gasoline and threw it into the pool.  

He set himself ablaze and jumped in and as he burned, he was calling out the words ‘they’re trying to drag me to the sea! All I can dream about is Him!’.  

This was when he and my mother were visiting England, thinking a change of scenery would help him, he’d been going through a severe bout of depression and paranoia and had already tried to take his life previously. It was a whole spectacle, even made the news.  

He wasn’t the only one to die, the majority of the people inside also perished with him. At the autopsy, there was something odd in his brain; another pair of eyes growing in the frontal lobe and a pair of metallic silver horns in the parietal.  

This last bit news did not reach American soil and was covered so well it hardly travelled outside the town of Fairbury, where the coroner resided.  

He took his life fairly recently, in the year 2012. In his suicide note he wrote the words; ‘I see what the boy was talking about, I have gazed into the nebulous eye of Him and He stares back at me and I know what the word ‘fear’ means for the first time. He is not something that should exist.  I can hear His song; piercing and malevolent as His gaze. Wanda, my love, I can only hope He doesn’t lay eyes on you.’ 

 
Speaking of which, when I took a job at a nursing home, hopeful that I would find answers to a myriad of questions that plagued my mind, and being hired due to my experience at various hospitals, I had an opportunity to speak to Wanda.  

I asked her about her husband, and who He was. And she burst into such hysteria that I worried she would pass at the very moment, when she told me to ‘get out’ it was in a voice that was not her own. 

 

Back to my mother, for that is where this tale continues; now she and my grandparents have always had a strained relationship and I believe it started around the time my uncle committed suicide.  

He had been the favored one, and they had treated him like the prince that he was. They hadn’t intended to send her off to a prestigious college but as my uncle had no need of his college fund, they sent her off for a career.  

She became a medical doctor and moved to Australia, where she met my father and the two got married. But I’m getting a little bit ahead of myself.  

In one of her year’s in college she and some of her friends decided to use a Ouija board. They were at one of her friend's house for her birthday party and were – aside from the woman at the party – all alone.  

Now, whenever my mother touched the board, she smelled the faint scent of the sea and this was very strange as the house lived nowhere near the ocean, and any lakes were miles off. But she and her friends kept playing until the board eventually spelled a series of words; ‘I can see you, Amy.’ and then the board flew through the window and the power went out.  

My mother and her friends became aware of something wet sounding running loudly down the hallway and then the door burst open. 
 
In the darkness the woman beheld the presence of something that was not human for the first time and were frozen, too terrified to move, until the sun rose beholding nothing in the open air other than the damp, dark wet footprints that were not shaped like anything humanoid.  

 

That takes us to the year 1985 and my birth. My first ever memory – much later of course - was being laid gently in water, and whether it was a baptism gone wrong or some other such thing I was entirely unsure.  

 

But I nearly drowned, and when I did I remember hearing this ‘aahhhh’ noise, not a scream, more like a discordant harmony. I was pulled out just before I passed away and I beheld the eyes of my mother, the look in her eye was one I always remembered, it was one I will never forget.  

I didn’t know how to explain it at the time but, if you were to ask me now, it would be the face of someone thinking ‘what did I just do?’ 

Throughout the course of my life, my mother showed signs of mental illnesses, whenever she was at work and able to distract herself by being busy she was for the most part fine (or so my father, who was a surgeon said so).  

 When she got home however, she’d do things that creeped me out, especially when I was younger.  

I’d find her standing in odd positions, gargling saltwater or humming. Sometimes I’d see her in the dark and not realize it was her at first, standing, soaking wet, murmuring in a growling tongue that did not sound anything like her.  

In the daytime she was paranoid and anxious when we were with her. Always looking over her shoulder as if something was watching her, sometimes telling me to stay away from pools or gasoline. 

Her odd behaviors did not cease as she aged and only grew worse. She at one point, though being far too old to have children, began to think she had got pregnant again and told everyone she was.  

She kept thinking she was going to have a son and around that time I remember a large number of people coming over to our house. 

 These people were descended from people who were friends of my grandmothers and though they had maybe met my mother once or twice, were staying the nights at our house, and every now and then I’d wake to all of them over my mother, singing her praises and kissing her. 

 I remember they were tattooing these symbols on her in veal blood and she kept them on for weeks at one point.  

My father at this time was overseas, fighting in the Gulf War, so he had no idea any of this was happening. I was too young to explain exactly what was going on to him and my mother – who I was scared of at just six years of age – was always there whenever I was talking so I had no real way of telling him without jeopardizing my safety.  

But just before my father returned, it all ended one morning when they realized my mother wasn’t showing any signs of pregnancy.  

She still got her period, she was not swelling at all. Finally, the jig was up when they went with her to the doctor’s and found she was not pregnant.  

When she got back home there was a change in her, she stopped this paranoia and the staying up at night and was acting normal.  

This didn’t last long, she had spells of anger that came and went and they were so intense it led to my father divorcing her and him taking me and leaving. What became of my mother, for a while I did not know.  

My life progressed as you might expect, no other strange things happened until about a decade and a half after I got out of Nursing school, in that time I got married, pregnant, and divorced.  

I had a son, Julian, and a daughter. My father passed away (he worked as a deckhand for a large company and made a solid amount of money) when he ‘fell’ off the boat and drowned one afternoon.  

Things began to change one night in the middle of September, Julian was 3 at this time and he woke me up after a long, tiring shift. I was not pleased and ready to snap at him when he said something that made me stop, cold.  

 

“Mommy, t-t-there’s someone outside the window,” he said. He was shaking and at the verge of tears. “She looks all big and gross and she’s been making this weird noise.” He opened his mouth and began making this low, croaking noise that occasionally stopped for maybe a second before going again, almost like a frog ribbiting, it made the hair on the back of my neck stand right up.  

 

I reached into the nightstand and pulled out my firearm before rushing to his bedroom. I hoped she wasn’t really there, I hoped it had been a nightmare or some other such thing but when I stepped into his room, I saw her. 

 She was so white she was glowing in the gloom, and she looked like a bloated, dead corpse, rotted for years. And she had broken through the glass and was standing in the middle of the room.  

When she saw me she opened her mouth wide and began to make the noise, extending one long pointer finger directly at me.  

She started running to me and Julian. 

I pulled the trigger.  

Once, twice, till it was out of ammo and clicking dead in my hands, the bullets went through her but did not stop her advancing until she was within kissing distance.  

I could feel her wrong, coldness against my skin and could feel her sweet, musky, horrid breath into my nostrils and on my tongue  

And then she was gone, just like that, as if she had never been.  
I’m sorry. I don’t...think I can continue tonight. I have more stuff from this point on but writing it is something I cannot bring myself to do. Later, maybe, but not now.
