[Monsters are real](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g0a4no/the_leftfield_files_imposters/). If you’re reading this, I’m sure you already know that. However, I decided I would affirm it to any new readers once they begin the journey through the information that I am trying to spread. It's not necessary at all to read any of the other logs that I've already written, unless you wish to be more informed of the things that go bump in the night.

Personally, I am not much of a believer in God. Even if he does exist, he’s certainly not something that I pray to. Demons, on the other hand, are very verifiably real, and take much pleasure in the horrors that they bring to the world. The story that I am about to tell is from my first encounter with the repercussions of a demon attack, who I would eventually know to call “The Musician”.

Sometimes, when you’re working a job for the Project, you end up not saving anyone. You get there too late, or you hear about the aftermath of a creature, and so you do your best to simply clean up the mess that was caused and prevent it from happening again. This was the case with the town of Blooming Meadows. John, my partner, and I were hailed by a police precinct while we were on our way back from dealing with a ghoul infestation. It was in northern Texas, June, 1967.

They apparently had an officer there who somehow was able to recognize members of the Project for who they were and flagged us down for a possible case. The police had collected a girl by the name of Constance Barone as she had wandered into their town. She had bloodied feet, a torn dress, and most notably, she had been bleeding from her ears. Constance was in a state of delirium, having walked throughout the whole night to find her way to the town. She told the police officer who had collected her that they needed to spread the word, no one could go to Blooming Meadows, which was a small town roughly fifteen miles out from where they had collected her.

She babbled further about other things, a puppet, a bad man, a piano, and apparently flinched at any noises louder than a whisper. Constance had been in custody for about a day when we happened to pass through town, and though the other officers were not much appreciative of our intervention, the man who had hailed us assured them that John and I were the best appointees for the job.

The room that John and I entered into was more befitting a criminal than a poor girl who had walked for an entire night. The police had stashed her in one of their interrogation rooms, simply having moved a bed in there. When I had asked the officer about this, he replied simply “No one wanted to take her home.”

I had a deep frown on my face as I saw her. Her now bandaged feet hung off the bed, her back pressed up against the wall, and a blank look on her face. Her eyes were wide, though there was nothing behind them. John gave me a look of concern as I crouched down in front of her. “Excuse me…” I softly spoke, trying to sound comforting, “Constance, right?”

“Mhm.” Came her reply, almost imperceptibly quiet. Her brown eyes finally focused on my face. She couldn’t have been more than ten years old, though whatever innocence that should have been filling her soul was banished by whatever she saw a few nights ago. Before I had a chance to ask a follow-up question, she spoke again. “Did the policemen ask you to come?”

“Yes. I’m Fletcher, and this here is my friend John,” I paused for a moment to gesture towards John, who was standing near the door. I assumed he was trying to seem the least intimidating as was possible for a man of his stature. “Could you tell us what you saw back in Blooming Meadows?”

Constance stared, some light finding its way into her eyes as she looked at me. I thought it made her seem alive again, even if just by a little bit. “Maybe.” Her look intensified, “Can you keep the bad man from coming to get me?” At this, she rubbed her ear, though kept her gaze on my eyes.

I thought for a moment, eventually nodding. “We can try our best. John and I specialize in these sorts of things.” I still wasn’t sure what to make of the situation. There was little that I could think of in that moment that would leave someone alive to go and tell its stories, especially considering I hadn’t met the Fibonacci cult at that point.

It took a while longer before I could coax Constance into talking. Her voice stumbled over its words, speaking them as though it would exorcise the feeling that was within herself. The following is a recounting as best as I am able to create, from both the information that she delivered as well as from a fey who owed me a favor, speaking to the plants and animals in the area to help fill in the gaps.

It started a few days ago. Someone new had come into town, or at least that’s what her parents had told her. Her mother and father had loved to gossip over the dinner table, and for some reason, the newest edition to their town was a hot topic. He had joined the church’s staff, and would be at mass this Sunday, apparently on the piano. Her mother and father went back and forth, talking about how ‘unbecoming’ it was of the church to allow such an individual as the newcomer into their ranks. Constance didn’t understand much of it, just that he apparently was a bad man who would likely do bad things.

That night was the first night that Constance could ever remember not being able to sleep. She laid in her bed for hours on end, not sure what prevented her from passing into the realm of slumber. Eventually, she became aware of the strangest sound coming from further down the street, the haunting yet beautiful music of a piano. It was playing a song that she had never heard before, but it was the most passionate song that she had ever heard played. She wasn’t quite sure where it was coming from, but she could feel it tugging at her. So, she put on her boots and quietly stepped out of the house, somehow knowing that this was why she had been awake all night.

She allowed the song to guide her, walking through the otherwise silent streets of her town until she came to the church. Her town's church was, from what she understood, completely normal. Small, unassuming, yet inviting. Its lights were on despite the time of night, casting a shifting shadow onto the grass, and the large doors into it were stuck open. It was as it always had been for Sunday mass, however, something about the church that night disturbed young Constance. Was it the ghastly faces which appeared in the shadows, horns upon their heads? Or maybe it was the way that the church, in the shifting light, seemed to transform itself into a mausoleum, its shadow dancing to the tempo of the music. Perhaps it was the smell of death, a smell that young Constance did not yet know how to place. She stood outside for some half-hour listening to the piano music, yet never stepping closer than the last streetlamp.

As she stood there, she made out the shape of another kid, an older one by the name of William, who looked just as enthralled as she felt by the music. His head full of black hair, the length of which had been another topic of gossip among her parents, swayed gently to the song. He did not seem to feel the same disturbing sensation that brought her to a standstill, and walked confidently towards the building. He passed through the doors, and turned towards Constance. Though there was a lazy smile attached to his face, tears streamed down his cheeks. He closed the two doors as the music reached a crescendo, and the lights turned off.

Awoken from her stupor, Constance ran as fast as she could towards her house. She had cried and told her parents about the song, and how William had entered the church, yet neither of them understood what she was so upset about. Her father had beat her, questioning her for waking them up, yet above all else, she mainly remembered his last question. “Who is William?” He had asked, and she tried to explain that it was William Hall, the boy who lived down the way, who had broken their window with a baseball. That William. Her father just looked at her with the most particular expression of annoyance, and told her to go back to bed.

Constance didn’t sleep well the following night, and it was not due to some lack of trying. She tossed and turned in bed until finally, around midnight, she heard the music again. Though it called her to the church, she laid in bed and stared at her ceiling. She could feel its rhythm tugging at her, telling her to dance, to spin, to follow, but she stayed put. When it reached its crescendo, she found herself crying once more, and buried herself under her blanket. A girl by the name of Amber Baker was missing from School the next day, Friday. Her parents had once been the topic of a particularly loud gossip session at her house, but no one remembered her either.

Saturday was a strange day for Constance. She hadn't heard the music the previous night, a freeing experience that had given her hope that it was over. She escaped from her mother's watchful eye and simply roamed the streets of the small town. Three times she ended back up at the church, her feet taking them there of their own accord. Each time she turned away, terrified of what she might find inside. The fourth time it happened, the light of the sun was hitting the windows and she could see the stained-glass mural of Christ. He seemed to beckon her inside, filling her with a false confidence that God was on her side. She stepped into the open church doors, and inside found them the same they had been the previous Sunday.

She didn't know what she expected, blood coating the floor? The pews, thrashed and torn aside? A corpse on the podium? She stood there for a long moment, staring at the unremarkable sight when she had been startled by a voice. 

“Hello, Miss Barone. May I help you?” The deep, velvety voice belonged to a tall man. He had dark skin, and apparently was the first black man the girl had ever seen. He wore plain clothes, a button down and brown pants, and had a kind smile on his face. His eyes, though, seemed to pierce through her like nails. She stood for a moment, unsure what to say, before asking him who he was.

The man introduced himself as Don, and apparently was the replacement for the previous pianist. Constance didn't know what had happened to the previous one, nor that they ever had one. Don had repeated his original question, and after Constance failed to answer, he patted her on the shoulder and said he would be around if she wished to listen to some music. It was only as his hand left her shoulder that she realized the man had a further oddity - six fingers on both hands. She continued to stand there for a few moments, his comment going through her head, and looked back at the mural for confidence. Its beckoning hand now seemed more to her as a ‘stop’ motion, and she turned, running from the church. It was only once she returned home that she wondered how Don had known her name.

Sunday was the last day that she was in Blooming Meadows. The church had a late mass, which confused her mother and father, but caused little other than more gossip at the dinner table. When the bells tolled, the people of the town flocked to the church. It now only held a sinister feeling for Constance, and though she complained to her mother and father, she was threatened with another beating by her father and meekly followed them in.

The pews were a hotbed of whispers. It was the loudest that she had ever heard them. Her neighbors and teachers talked amongst themselves, saying nasty things and a word that she had never heard before. As Don entered the room behind their priest, the congregation quickly fell silent. For the most part, all of what Constance remembered from the mass was that it was startling normal. Don hadn't used music sheets, recalling the notes and lyrics on his own, but there was no strangeness past the venomous looks the man received. After they were served communion, however, everything changed.

The first man who had stepped up stopped dead in his tracks on his way out of the church. He stood stock still, then slowly began twitching more and more. Suddenly, he raised his arms in the pose of a ballerina, the room fell silent, and she could hear the quiet sound of bones breaking as he began to dance.

One by one, the members of the congregation fell into step. Their arms were pulled, as if they were marionettes, held by invisible strings. They danced and swirled, their bodies contorting in ways that could not have been natural. The rhythm of the music that she could not hear kept them in line. Slowly, Constance became aware that each and every adult in the room was crying, though they made no sound. Their mouths were open in twisted agony, but they made no sound. Her and the other children stood to the side, confused and terrified by the performance, and Constance felt her gaze drawn to look at Don.

His hands stretched across the piano, his fingers a blur as they played notes that she couldn't hear. His face was deep in focus, eyes closed and brow furrowed as his mouth muttered words that she could not make out. As he played, the piano that he sat at began to change from the simple wooden one that the church kept to something more. Pale golden lines spread up the sides, a strange light emitting from them. The room was completely silent but for the sound of painful footsteps across their newfound stage, dancing to an unhearable melody, but one she knew well. Suddenly, a shrill scream broke the reverie.

She didn't know who had started it, but once it started, Constance had begun to run for the door, breaking her eyes away from Don. The adults, pulled along by their master, stumbled over themselves to grab at her and the other children. She didn't know if any others made it out, but as she finally escaped from the building and ran far away from the church, she began to hear the music once more. The same as it has been the previous nights, it slowly grew and grew in volume and pace. She could feel it in her mind, as though the music was weaving its way behind her eyes and trying to drag her back. She felt as though she were being grabbed at by hundreds of threads as well, but she tore herself out of their knots. As the music peaked one final time, it all stopped.

Eventually, she made her way back into the town. She saw nothing and no one as she found herself drawn towards the church, though not from a mystical sensation, but rather her own curiosity. As she reached the building, it seemed to have changed from the one in her mind. It seemed older, decrepit in a way that it hadn't before. Cracks in the wall that might've been there before now seemed more prominent and concerning. Most of all, there wasn't a single soul inside the building. Time passed as she eventually turned and made her way back to the road, and just began to walk.

John and I investigated the town afterwards. It only could have had maybe a hundred or so people living there, and none of them were there any longer. In fact, the town looked like no one had lived in it for decades. Houses had broken windows, weeds grew up over the sides of buildings and claimed them for their own. I told myself that I'd research the town later, and joined John on the path towards the church.

When we reached it, the church appeared deceptively unremarkable. Unlike the other houses in the town, this one seemed untouched by time, held in place as a well worn but well loved house of worship. The doors were open, and the inside was completely clean of damage as well. The pews were neat and orderly, lined up in perfect rows. The glass windows were almost shining, and in them I noticed that the depicted face of Christ was one of great anger. It was then that I noticed the piano.

It had an opulent case, with thin gold markings weaving their way through the wood. The lines created hundreds of small symbols on the wood, some appearing as demonic faces screaming, others as occult symbols that I couldn’t place the origin of. Its top was held open, and the inside of the case also held a painting of a large, towering figure with goat hooves and two curling ram horns. It showed this figure offering a hand towards a man, who was on his knees in prostration. I could also see that there were no strings in the piano. Despite this, the keys kept their pressure, and were absolutely scorched. Black marks had been burned into most of the keys with incredible precision, not a speck of soot on any other surface. I think the Project still has it in its storage room, somewhere.

There was a growing scent of decay in the air, and after looking around further, John and I discovered a basement from which the stench came from. We entered the room to find a younger man, pale, and hanging from his feet. His throat was slit, and the blood had been drained into a circular pattern, one which John took a sketch of in his notebook. The center of the floor that held the pattern had a crack on it, from which the smell of sulfur escaped. We destroyed the remains of the circular pattern in the floor, and the smell quickly dissipated despite the lack of an airflow down there. We left the town not too long after that, unable to discover more. We only spoke once we left the town behind us, apparently unwilling to break the silence it projected.

\-

“I can only suppose that it was the priest who summoned him.” I said, looking over the sketch of the circle, and comparing it with a field guide that I had been attempting to build. It was reminiscent of different satanic symbology, though apparently more real than most of what I had found in libraries while attempting to build knowledge. “I just… fuck, John.” I rubbed my forehead, planting the book firmly in my lap.

“You can't be everywhere at once. None of us can,” His tone was one of chastising sincerity “It's all we can do to solve the cases we already do.”

I stared forward for a long time, lost in my thoughts, unable to come to a reply I felt was proper. We weren't super heroes, we were men. It sucked sometimes, but that was the truth. “It's just… Why do we have to do this so quietly? If people knew-”

“You know that's not an option.” John cut me off, sounding oddly heated. I wondered how often he had this thought process on his own accord. “It's not feasible to inform everyone, and it's twice as dangerous to boot. The lack of information keeps them safe.”

“That sounds like bullshit if I've never heard it.” It was an inciting moment for me, one where I thought that if others knew, if they just understood, then somehow…

“Well, trust me - even if you think the higher ups are insane. There’d be too many loose threads.” He shook his head, and his face contorted slightly as he said it, looking obviously uncomfortable.

A part of me wanted to continue to poke at this, it was a weak argument and we both knew it. Instead I leaned back in the chair and let John drive silently, deciding not to argue further with my partner. I didn't think there was a point if he was willing to bring up a bullshit reason to waive the conversation. We decided that we'd return to pick up Constance and put her through a program run by the Project to keep an eye on people who might be in danger from a previous case. When we returned to pick her up, the police there looked at us like we were from another planet.

“What girl?” Asked the officer who first brought her to our attention. I realized that I never asked for his name, though it really didn't matter to me at the moment. I felt the blood drain from my face as John simply sighed and turned around.

“Constance, the young girl with bleeding feet?” I tried again, beginning to feel desperate. He looked at me with even more confusion, my poor description failing to invoke a memory in the man.

Shaking his head, he waved us off. “Haven't seen anything like that, though I know who to call if I do.” He said, gesturing towards the door, obviously ready for us to go. I can only imagine what was going through his mind, whatever power that this “Don” must've possessed making it impossible to take John and myself seriously. Concern turned to rage as I turned towards my partner who had already exited the building. I ran after him.

I slammed open the doors, not caring about the ruckus that I made while doing so, and shouted a curse loud enough to get a few looks from across the street. John didn’t stop walking. Ideas swam through my head, but in my heart I knew the poor girl was already gone, that I had lied to her. I crossed off options from what I could have done, trying to reassure myself that the choices had all been the best ones I could have made with the information that I had.

She had walked for an entire night without being caught, why had this thing let her go? I had no cause to believe it was still hunting her. It would have been stupid for us to bring her with us to the town, it could have been dangerous. The police should have all been watching her and could have intervened if something happened. John didn’t say anything to me for the rest of the day, dropping the subject and apparently trying to purge it from his mind. It’s probably why he seemed so sane compared to most of the agents who work there for as long as we did.

\-

I’m not quite sure how to classify this story, as it’s not quite my own, but rather the lost story of a little girl. I did my research on Blooming Meadows afterwards, back at HQ. Sure enough, the town had a census just recently, listing one-hundred and fourteen individuals who had lived there. I can only suppose that the disrepair was an effect of ‘Don’, though it was strange to me at the time that he would leave the church unaffected.

I don’t exactly have a moral to take from this story. Don’t be a dumb ass is all I could suggest. This feels like one of the ones where it would have been especially useful for someone who knew what they were doing to have been around when it went down. That poor fucking kid. This is Agent Fletcher, signing off.

**>ADDITIONAL NOTES**

Further research through case files will show that “The Musician” that Fletcher ran into here is no longer active today. At least, not in the same body nor partaking in the same habits that it once did. I believe the last mention of it was in 1989. Incidentally, that is also the last year that Fletcher worked for the Project, though I could find no hard evidence in our files that the two events are correlated. However, I obviously have my suspicions.
