I’m not quite sure how this whole thing works but I’m just going to tell you this story and get it over with. I own a bar, it’s a pretty nice one too with those sweet wooden bar stools, a beautifully polished bar top and a big dartboard. Well it *had* a big dartboard until that stupid boy came in, did some stupid shit with his cigarette and some darts and managed to burn a part of the board. I’m not sure how it happened because I was busy running the bar. 



But the punk had the nerve to laugh it off and then say that he didn’t have enough money to even pay. Now I’m a pretty big guy and I’m used to idiots like this coming to bars and creating noise. But I was pretty intrigued when he said he had a true story that he knew could get him out. It was a slow night, I was buzzed and feeling kind enough to let him speak.



“You better not be foolin around or I’ll break that pretty nose of yours boy,” I spat into his face as I set down my large beer mug and sat down. I leaned forward to take a loud sip of my drink.



“Hey this nose has been on magazines, and luckily I’m not lying,” He shot me a schmoozy grin revealing perfect teeth. I’ve never wanted to punch someone more.



“I first noticed him in the mirror before an audition. I was still trying to break into modeling back then and that day I spent tubes and tubes of hair gel trying to get my hair up.” he continued.



He swept a hand through his blond hair that was in fact, loosely flopped over his face as he spoke.



“I gave up on my hair, did the audition and well you’ve all seen the billboards- I got it.” 



“Your hair looks pretty upright there blondie” one of my loud friends in the bar hollered as the rest made drunk jokes about things being upright. I still wanted to knock his teeth out, this was a stupid story already.



“That’s the kicker, I couldn’t believe the pictures with my hair up like that. When I was washing my face in the dinghy bathroom on set, I saw myself in the mirror, hair down.”



He paused with dramatic effect and looked at us with wide eyes. I bit out with a snarl, “That’s the story you thought would get you out of paying me 80 dumarks? That’s the story you thought could make up for my dartboard?”



“No, no that's just the beginning.” The fool was still smiling. “My reflection always had his hair down. And now I know that he just prefers it that way but back then it creeped me out. I began to pay attention and one day I caught something else when I was doing up my tie for a dinner- a piercing. It was on my left ear and I checked in every mirror in my house, heck I even checked on my reflection behind the spoon. It was always there, a glinting stone on my ear.”



“From there, I think he got sloppy. For the most part he’d cooperate, sit there and smile if I did, frown, make funny faces. When I noticed his brand new second piercing on the other ear, I lifted my hand up. 

He did too.

I brought it close to my ear.

He did too.

I pulled on my earlobe.

He didn’t. 

I smiled and he frowned.



From then on, he gave up. He wore whatever he wanted, usually black leather jackets with chains and grunge pins. His hair was always down, the piercings grew, one time I caught him drinking when I turned around and looked back.”



This was the stupidest story I’ve ever heard and that brought out a chuckle. 



“He never spoke until that point though. I was giving myself a pep talk in the mirror before the award show, telling myself how many awards I’d already won, how I’d ace that speech and everything would be fine. 



That was when he said, ‘*yeah right.’* Now I’ve done my fair share of self deprecation, but seeing him snarl that at me with his cigarette between his fingers made me mad. ‘*You don’t even live the actor's life’*, he told me.



I threw out all my mirrors, but it didn’t stop. I still saw him everywhere, waving his fingers at me from puddles, some woman draped across him on shiny tiles, grinning at me on cutlery. I threw everything out.” 



At this point I had a new drink and my friends had quieted down, listening now with rapt attention.



“But then came the movie offers”, the actor continued. “As someone who made money off of my face, it was ridiculous to not be able to see myself. So I got a mirror, a full length one and I met him for the first time officially.



He didn’t speak much, just said gave me an amused *hey* when I greeted him and asked if I wanted to shake hands. Now if he could talk, and get piercings and drinks and women, the concept of him reaching out didn’t seem too outlandish. He told me to reach into the mirror.



The cool glass of the mirror felt like it was just air, like it was nothing and my hand went right through it. But immediately on the other side the cold air chilled my hand as I felt a strong arm shake it. It felt like my arm was in cold slime, heavy and foul. It felt so so wrong. Something instinctive, a primal fear made me yank my hand back, turn off the lights and flip the mirror around. I could still hear him laughing for days.



But from that day on, I never looked back. I never looked at my reflection again. I don’t know what he’s doing, maybe he has a family. 



I made my money, I landed some of the biggest roles in cinema, I traveled and met people and I’ve begun leading the actor’s life, that brought me to this lovely bar and I truly did not mean to break your dartboard. I’d pay you 80 dumarks but you can see I’m pretty broke.”



The man turned his pockets out, revealing a pack of cigarettes and nothing else. 



It had been a pretty fun story I guess, I had fun listening to it and the idiot really didn’t have any money on him. I drained the rest of my beer and looked up,“I told you, you better not be lying.” 



The actor laughed his rich laugh,”I’m not lying. Can I go now?”



But I had remained transfixed, staring at the bar counter where he’d just placed his mug down. I don’t remember doing it but I nodded once, a quick jerk of my head and the man nonchalantly walked out of the bar. Somewhere as if in another universe, miles away I could hear my friends begin booing loudly, but I couldn’t move. I was paralyzed by cold dread, staring only at the polished bar top.



That was where Id seen the actor’s reflection, a clean man with his hair styled up.

When he'd left, I'd finally noticed it. My own reflection, staring back, grinning as it winked at me.
