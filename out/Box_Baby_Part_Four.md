My body coursed with adrenaline. My heart pumped my veins with fire. I resisted the absolute thundering command to run and instead assessed the situation, as quick as I could, eyes glued to the dim figure of Natia outside. She was now looking at her hands as if she’d never seen them before. I could never outrun her. I had to close these car doors and lock her outside. It was the only shot I had at surviving this.   

My head swam with the savage memories that had been forced into my own head minutes earlier. I knew the thing had performed this trick before. A little girl who had snitched on her baby ‘brother’ had been told to ‘eat them’ as the village elders carried the baby out of her family’s cottage. The command had been delivered audibly, but was coupled with a complex psychic undoing. Like a spell. All reason, desire and thought had been wiped from her mind for all time, until only the command remained. She existed only to fulfil her orders.  

Natia was gone. The woman outside now an empty vessel, driven by one solitary goal.  

I swung my hand towards the door handle. My fingers slid like an empty glove down the door. Natia heard this and turned her head. The second she saw me, she sprang towards the door. I swung my arm again and this time three of my fingers gripped the door handle. I had to send orders to each finger individually, telling them to grip tight. There was no strength in my arm to pull the door closed, so I threw my weight back into the car, making sure that each finger stayed hooked in the door. The door began to close. Natia had rounded the bonnet of the car and threw herself at the door, closing it for me.  The sound of that door snapping neatly closed was the sweetest sound I had ever heard.  

Natia’s eyes never left mine. There was not a trace of her behind those dark pupils. They showed only a vacant animal hunger. She began biting at the window as she tried to eat her way in to get at me. Her teeth chinked against the wet glass. Her hands beat against the car’s frame.  

I shouted her name. It did not register. I threw my useless rubber hand at the inside of the door and after three attempts, I managed to fumble the lock into position.  

The passenger door was still wide open. I cast my head towards it. The darkness through that open door buzzed with indescribable danger. I began to move myself towards it. Each limb had to be commanded separately to move, because co-ordinating them was no longer on my résumé. I floundered across the middle of the car, the park brake lever digging into my ribs. I dragged my useless, prickling body towards the open door. I managed to push myself forward with my right leg - the only one still taking orders. My muscles burned and strained against my bones. Natia had slowed in her attempts to eat her way through the window. She was now making a shouting, snarling sound each time she thrust her head at the glass. I didn’t dare look at her.  

I had reached the passenger seat. It was soaked with the rain that had blown through the car. I planted my left hand into it and hoisted myself up in a sort of side push-up, my elbow screaming in protest. The door was swinging back and forth gently in the wind. I shouted at my free arm to reach into the night and close it.  

The rhythmic grunting and thumping from the other side of the car stopped at that moment. Complete silence followed, save for the low moan of the wind. I listened for her footsteps on the gravel, her hands on the car as she made her way around the tailgate to the gaping door, but there was dead silence.  

If you’ve ever been in a state of pure terror, you’ll know what I felt in that moment.  My eyes ran with water and my scalp crawled with panic. 

I shot my hand out into the dark towards the handle. The door swung away from me in the wind, and my hand flailed down the inside, barely touching it. I gathered myself for another attempt, trying to inch forward across the seats. I waited for the door to swing towards me in the next gust, shooting my arm forward with what little strength I could access. My fingers slid down the wet surface. I pushed my working foot against the locked driver’s door and pushed myself out into the night air, leaning out for a better chance of success. My hair whipped around my face as I lunged for the swinging car door. I cried out as my hand gripped the handle and I wrenched it towards me, twisting myself away from it so that it could close. There was a soft click as the door kissed the latch, barely holding onto it.  

There was a thumping, scrambling noise from outside. I strained myself towards the windscreen to see the dark figure of my hunter clambering up onto the bonnet and begin beating against the glass with her face. The whites of her eyes caught the green light from the car radio with every ‘thump’ of her head hitting the windscreen.  She hit the glass so hard that I remember thinking, 

*Jesus, she’s going to get in. She’s going to get me.* 

I couldn’t shake this realisation. It sank through me like hot lead. I scrambled and kicked and fought my way upright, pulling on the passenger door handle until it clicked again, louder this time. I thumbed the lock closed. She didn’t need the door to get to me though. I doubt she even knew how to use them now. 

Natia began screaming with each blow. It was a cry of unfiltered hunger.  Each scream ended with a crack as she slammed her face against the rain and blood-spattered windscreen. She was getting faster, spending less time to recover between each blow.  

I’m not sure how long I spent trying to marshal my limbs into dragging me to the driver’s seat. It felt like hours. I had to try the engine one last time. Maybe it would access some untapped energy from the battery now that the engine had sat idle and cooling for so long. Fuck knows. I know nothing of cars and engines, but it was worth a try.  

The next *thump* from the windscreen ended in a soft 'clink!' 

She’d finally cracked the glass. I swung for the car keys, still dangling from the ignition.  

Natia must have sensed something had changed because she started rearing back and throwing all her weight at the cracked glass.  

Thump-schikk! 

A small chunk of glass fell from the middle of the crack and clattered off the park break.  I ordered my right hand to close its useless rubber fingers around the keys and grip. Tighter.  

Natia smashed her face into the windscreen again and forced her tongue through the small hole. It worked its way inside, tasting for me in the air.   

I turned the key. 

Natia chewed and licked at the sharp hole, pushing her face slowly through it. Small square chunks of glass rained down into the car.  

The engine turned over, stronger than before …but quickly spluttered and died.  

The old me died with it. I knew in that moment that even if I survived what was about to happen, my old stupid, bubbly chatterbox self had left the building for good. It’s a terrible thing to watch your whole identity slip away from you. I would not wish that on anyone. And knowing what was about to happen to me was almost worse than what followed. Almost.  

I ripped the keys from the ignition as my only weapon and the darkness swallowed me. The green light from the radio blinked out.  

I heard Natia’s face entering the car, her flesh tearing. I learned later that she’d almost scalped herself on the glass as she forced her way in face first. Blood tapped against the dashboard. She made a final lunge and before I could blink, her mouth was on my face, biting into it with her jagged, broken teeth. 

I fought her off as best I could, but 

 but

i’m sorry, I thought I could relive this for you. that writing about this would be a a relief  but I just can’t go back to this. I can’t it’s too much for me - i can still feel her teeth around my eye..  aNd and she..i tried to push her away but she... i screammed but my EYE was in her   MOUTHH  sHe bit the cord..ANd it felt exactly how you think it would fucking feel.  cAn you hear the noises she made when she chewed on it becaus i can and it ran out of her mouth into MINEand Jesus I KNOW WHAT MY EYE TASTES LIKE 

 

time out 

 

..... 

 

…okay I’ve thrown all the wine up and popped my emergency Prazosin and my heart is starting to settle now. It makes me dizzy as hell and double that when I’ve been drinking, but if I stay at the desk I’ll be fine until I drift off to sleep. The doors are locked.  I’m okay. I know I’m safe now really and it can’t get me. Are we enjoying ourselves? Let’s get this done, you fucking ghouls.  

 

What you need to know is that I managed to get my door open and push myself outside. I don’t know how I managed it with her chewing at my face, gripping my cheek in her mouth and shaking her head like a terrier until the flesh came loose, but I did it.  I fell hard into the road and the rain stung my open face. It hurt like hell. Natia came with me. But her leg was caught in the shattered windscreen somehow and I managed to kick at her with my right leg and keep her away from my stomach with my left hand as I slithered my way out from under her and out of the car.  

To be honest with you, I have no idea how I managed to shut the door on her head with my knee. Somehow my right foot had planted itself in a dip between the asphalt and the gravel and I could wedge my knee against the door and swing it shut. My leg was sort of locked into place and the harder she pushed against the door, the more my knee pushed the door shut. It took me half an hour to pull my useless left leg out from under her, but not before she managed to chew through my jeans and sink her ruined teeth into my calf on its way out. She would have eaten it to the bone if I hadn’t got it away from her.  

She writhed and snarled and licked my blood off her teeth until the truck driver found us at first light. His name was Dave and he shouted and screamed and cried when he saw me. Poor Dave - he was such a nice man. He cried the whole hour we waited for the police. I told him to keep his weight against the door or she would kill us both, even though I knew he would be safe. ‘Just push against it,’ I’d spluttered through the blood.  ‘Please don’t let them shoot her. I’m gunna pass out now, Mister Dave…’  

I don’t remember the police arriving. Or the ambulance. Or the rest of that July.  

I’m told that they had to remove three of her teeth from my cheekbone and forehead. The tabloids really loved that detail. When I first saw my bandaged face in a mirror, my remaining eye was red and jittery, like someone else we know. He must have had months of exposure to that thing, and Christ knows what damage it did to his brain. I only spent a few hours with it and I have no memories before the age of fifteen, am now colourblind and can no longer taste salt. It took me 12 months to learn how to speak properly again. I have never tried to search for the man who left it in the box, even though I know his name. Tony almost certainly died that very night.  

I’ve had a total of seven reconstructive surgeries on my face, but have now been told there’s only so much that can be done. On the upside, only the right side of my face was eaten, and I’ve grown my hair long so that I can go about my business with my hair covering the offending side. Now that Halloween is finally becoming a thing in this country, I will gravitate towards a Phantom of the Opera mask. Some years I wear it over my ‘good side’ if I’m feeling particularly nihilistic, which is most years, if I’m being honest. People complain sometimes, but like the lady said, ‘Fuck ‘em.’ 

As for my ‘boyfriend,’ Gabe never once visited me in hospital. He must have heard about what happened to me. It was all over the news, but I never heard from him again. I will admit that this hurt me pretty deep. I’ve come to terms with the fact that he will most likely be the last boyfriend I will ever have.  

It took me a long time to be able to leave the house, and when I do, I am on a constant lookout for prams and strollers, giving them a very wide berth. I don’t listen to the radio because every second fucking song has ‘baby’ in it. When my brother and his wife had their first kid, they didn't ask me to hold the baby, probably because they didn’t want the baby to be traumatised at the sight of Aunty Kate. I assure you, this was fine by me.  

Sometimes I wonder what Natia would have done if she had got to finish her meal, bones and all. I don’t think they would have found her wandering in the bush, hunting for her next meal. I’m pretty sure she would have stayed in that spot, licking every drop of me off the car seat, dashboard and road until they hauled her away. It took five officers to subdue her as it was. 

I know she eats nothing in that hospital she’s locked up in. They feed her through a tube and her mum tells me that she’s very thin and spends all day staring at the door, like she’s waiting for someone to arrive at any moment. If anyone obstructs her view of the doorway, she’ll crane her neck to see around them. I’m told that’s the only time she will move of her own accord, and I’ve resolved never to visit her to prove them wrong. 

I told everyone the truth about what happened - save for the improbable baby and his guardian, of course. The official story goes like this: 

I picked up a hitchhiker.   

We ran off the road after I tried to avoid a cardboard box.  

The hitchhiker went crazy and tried to eat my face.   

But I got away. 

The end.  

That’s the story the cops, my brother and my mum got. And it’s true, technically.  

My mum doesn’t understand why I’m Facebook friends with Natia’s mother. Or why I call her once a week to see how Natia’s doing in that place. I tell mum I’m not angry at her mother - or with Natia, really, which she cannot handle. And I get it. Natia’s the one who attacked and tried to eat her baby girl.  But I want you to know that Natia was a fucking cool person. She was brave and kind and funny and she fought that little cunt with all her might.  

The police told me much later that they’d found her jacket on the floor of the passenger seat. I asked them how they knew it wasn’t mine and they said that her name was written on the collar tag, which shut me up. It fits, I guess. It would have taught itself to read sooner or later. She might have stood a chance if she hadn’t liked her muppet coat enough to write her name on the tag. Oh, and they only ever returned one of my shoes to me. I guess the other one is still out there sitting by the side of that road. 

 

..... 

 

So now to the reason I’m posting this, aside from the chance that one of you will get some potentially handy survival tips from reading it, should you ever come across this thing.  

Yesterday I was out on of my very rare supermarket excursions.  Usually, I try to order online and have them deliver to my door, so that I only have to deal with one person recoiling in horror instead of twenty, but sometimes I just need to get out of the apartment. This supermarket chain has a ‘Quiet Hour’ between 6 and 7pm weekdays, so that everyone who’s on the spectrum can shop in peace and not be bothered by the normies, bright lights and loud noises. They turn half of the lights off, so it’s nice and dark and there’s no music for a change, which makes it bearable for me. 

I was in the middle of the dark store, right in the baking goods aisle and reaching for some caster sugar when I felt it. 

That old, familiar feeling.  Pure dread, like a visit from a hated friend. That bitter, spiteful presence soaked into me like I’d just been plunged into a vat of ice cold, sour milk. 

My head throbbed with a migraine that would last for 12 hours. I dropped the sugar right there on the floor, left my half-filled trolley where it was and blundered my way out of there. My legs barely carried me. You know those nightmares where your legs barely work right when you need to run?  Well it’s a lot less fun in real life. I nearly knocked over a mother and her kid at the end of the aisle.  

I’m embarrassed to admit that I dropped my keys twice trying to get into my car like some stupid bitch in a horror movie, my hands were shaking so bad. Its thoughts weren’t as strong in the carpark, but I could tell that it was searching... probing the air.  Had it sensed me too? Was it trying to place the familiar flavour of my thoughts... searching through its vast memory for when it had last tasted that particular mind? Believe me when I tell you that I wasn’t about to stick around and find out. Odds are that it knows my name by now. I was all over the news and there’s been multiple books and true crime podcasts about the ‘case.’ 

I peeled out of the car park and barrelled through the streets until I knew for sure that I had left its cold orbit. When they pulled me over for speeding, I was in such a state that they let me go and escorted me home, helping me to my door. I think the cop recognised me – A Current Affair just did a ten year recap on the ‘a Hitchhiker Ate My Face’ version of the story, so I’m back in the news cycle for a hot minute. 

I don’t know if it was in my neighbourhood specifically to search for me, or if pure blind chance put it in close enough proximity to me that we sensed each other. The latter seems unlikely. At any rate, I’m done keeping its secrets. Once I post this, you will all know what I know, and I’ll be packing my bags and moving far, far away from here. 

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading. Be careful out there.

And finally, to Natia: I’m so sorry I picked you up that night. I hope your soul has found peace somewhere and I hope that when this thing finally gets what it deserves, you will be free.  

I cry for you every day, and please know that I am crying for you right now and always.
