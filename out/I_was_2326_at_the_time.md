I was 23 when I moved into this semi old house, it was located behind a bar as I moved in renting the whole upstairs of the complex. 

There were 5 tenants who lived there before me, as I only know who the tenant was before me. He was a nice guy, haven't seen him since his release of jail as he was thrown in jail for making military like weapons in the house as well as making his own lsd and hallucinogens. Weird guy but still nice to everyone around him.

Once he was thrown in jail, it took about a month or two for the housing people and the governmentals to take his stuff and leaving only his garbage (it was garbage because before I moved it I cleaned it up before I moved in to cheapen my first few months of rent)
I kept a few things for my self obviously since everything was garbage but nothing to substantial, nothing that could get pawned either. 

First few months was alright as after 4 months in, I gotten a roommate to rent out the other room next to the living room as I get the two attic rooms. She was a gorgeous woman but seemed off, like idk she never seemed like she was fully there (I thought she was a recovery addict) she stayed in that room and was very polite but always distant.

Once she moved out after her first year she asked if I can take throw away what was remaining, I haven't seen anything weird or out of the ordinary but the whole room didn't feel right at all. Throwing if off I never really experienced nothing in this house.

6 months have passed and I gotten an elderly man as a roommate, really cool guy if I say so, had some cool stories. It wasn't until a few weeks of him living in that room he asked me if I hear stuff in the house, as I tell him "never have." His paranoia or something must of been pushed to a 10 because he moved out a few months later. 

Now it was just me in this house again, all other tenants moved out and the house suddenly started getting colder. 

By this time I have been at the house for 2 years experiencing nothing except for the house being cold. But that shortly changed as I would start hearing scratched in the ceiling walls. I at the time thought it was birds or rats, but I never seen rats and kept the house as clean as I could so lastly I had a conclusion it was only birds. But it was midnight and birds would usually be in the trees or the woods, you know in their respectful habitat. I kept it like that as that's what I thought it was. 

My mom was about to become homeless so I let her have one of my empty rooms. This is where the house didn't feel right, as my mom would ask me as well like one of the previous tenants did "Do you hear voices or feel like someone is looking at you sometimes?" I tell her as well no but I did tell her about the scratches. So she asked her boyfriend at the time if he can set up some mouse traps rat traps or whatever they were around the house, in the basement, in the washer and dryer room, in the attic, anywhere he can place. We never caught anything.

My mom's paranoid would only grow as she's saying "while your at work, I hear scratches and thumping in the attic and in your room" I told her if she hears that she could investigate my room, but her boyfriend should really be the only to investigate in case of a burglary. 

It's been almost 3 years at this point my mom moves out first to once again, it's me alone in this house. As I always ignored the noises I heard thinking it's just birds, I started hearing noises coming from the basement that has a old metal door, my landlords always kept that door locked as it's just the boiler room. I heard bangings come from that door lately as this time I couldn't say it's just birds or rats at this time. So I called my landlords about it and they said "it shouldn't be locked" so I cut the bolt and opened the door with a gush of cold wind hitting my face
. 
That night I heard a woman in the house, there's no one here but me, grabbing my gun and my phone, I go downstairs to see if I can find the person breaking in. All doors and windows are closed with everything locked. No one is here but me. There's still thumping and a scream of help coming from downstairs so I ran down the stairs into the basement thinking I could catch a burglary in action within my own house. No one. 

I start to panic and call my mom's boyfriend and my oldest brother to come by, it's past midnight at this time and I end up staying at my brother's for the night. 

I moved out shortly after and informed the landlords. I noticed they sold the house and they have someone new occupying this place..

I feel like I should inform them but it's been about 5 years now since I moved out. With a feeling I run into the new tenants while the oldest son is now working with me, he says the house doesn't feel right and they keep hearing thumping. I told him about what I experienced when I lived there and now they are getting a pastor to bless the house. 

I'd say the house was never haunted or anything, but idk I'm not very skeptic upon ghost stories as it could of just been like I said rats, mice and birds. But what was the thumping and the woman's plee for help. To this day I may never know.
