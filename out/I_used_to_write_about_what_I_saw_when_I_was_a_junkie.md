I recently found a lot of my old writing from back when I used to use. I don’t know if this is the right place for it. But there’s a lot, and I can’t bring myself to get rid of it.

This section is how it starts. I think I thought I had a mission to accomplish at the time.


The not so distant yelling woke me. A bum was being ransacked by a roaming group of tweakers, he could do nothing but yell in protest, the whole thing would be over in less than a minute. Pushing myself off the pavement I scanned the area through blurred vision.

“It’s those fucking loyalist cunts you had to worry about” An Irishman crouched in the corner was glaring at me, his eyes wouldn’t close even for a second.

“Don’t hate the English” He continued. “There are plenty of them who are lovely people, not a bad bone in their body. The RUC are the fucking murderers. Some of the English were on our side, their own turned on them for digging too deep. We had this one fella come down south to get away, spent some time with my father even, used to go fishing we did. Those IRA boys knew how to get things fucking done I tell ya that much.”

I could feel the crematorium beckoning, it’s been creeping up on me the last few times I remember, getting closer now. The Irishman stands, walks in two circles, looks into the distance, then returns to his crouching spot, and begins again, looking at me through glassed eyes.

“It’s those fucking loyalist cunts you had to worry about”

He’s stuck in a loop, must have been giving a fucking speech or something when the black cloaks came for him. I don’t remember how I got here, I usually don’t, that’s not the problem, the problem is that fucking crematorium, it’sbeginning to salivate, I can smell its stench.

My surroundings resemble a parking lot, an abandoned one. The pavement reflected the flickering lights above, like a water main had burst, leaving a thin layer of water floating above the ground. Two birds danced in a figure of eight off in the dim lit side of the car park, their long dresses floating by the wayside, stuttering and changing colour each time the two collided in the middle. On the fifth or six hundredth pass the fabric knots, the dancers flail manically, stabbing wildly , blood splashes out in all directions, soon the both of them are bathed in red, the blood trails form a broken pentagram under their feet, the younger of the two mounts the other, forcing itself inside, leaving nothing but a deformed foetus in their place. I’m in front of the deformed clump of cells, picking it up when it happens.

The eye asks me how I’ve been lately, to which I laugh, it already knows. I don’t know if I’ll ever get used to floating in the nether, always feels off, like a million tiny hands holding me up into nothing. The eye continues to look, iris fading from green to dark brown then back again. 

“What happened?” My mouth lags, the words float by before my jaw moves.

The eye blinks, the air bends in return.
“You went too far again.” The eye thinks aloud.

“His stories were entertaining, I don’t know what to tell ya, a guy who grabs a magnum from the bottom draw and blows his own brains out in the middle of a conversation about lithium cells and governmental policy. It-It’s captivating yaknow?”. I could feel one of the miniature hands tickling my left toe and proceeded to scratch it, the air, still wobbly, rippled away from my moving body in disgust.

“How long are you gonna keep me here?” I asked while my mouth shouted obscenities into the void.

“As long as you want.” Was his retort.
The eye began blinking shortly after, I’m sure of it. I feel I had forgotten for many years, but I am only now so sure. The cacophony of screams, rumbles and confessions that came from the blinking has given me traumatic dreams ever since. The eye blinked itself into non-existence and I ended up here.
 
This motherfucker in front of me has been snacking away on a bowl of red syringe tips for at least 10 years and it’s really starting to piss me off. Cunt snack probably knows they’re my favourite too. As I’m plotting my murder-suicide he vomits, precious red needles flow out of his mouth along with an ocean of the good gooey stuff. I look on with mournful tears, another addict being touched by God.

Before long I’m in Dante’s seventh hell having a conversation with a dapperly dressed slug, his wife is murdering the children in the background and signing Bach while she does. He tells me of the intricacies of sacrificial ceremonies during a mid-life crisis. And how bathing in coffins placed in the early 20’s can rejuvenate one’s mindset towards life goals.

The neon streets around us shimmered through the drifting snow, and off in the distance through echoes of hovercraft and pharmaceutical advertisements I could hear a prostitute masturbating a leper, and the he/she was getting close to the finish line. Its voice croaked and spluttered, like a clogged vacuum, inhaling and exhaling in fragmented segments. Wailing like an injured animal on its last legs “Take it you slut”.

The journey was to be long, but one would hope fruitful, the streets around me reeked of third world contingencies. The slug said there was bound to be a deal going on around heresomewhere and all we need do is acquire some funds and we’d be about ready for crusade. He loaded me up a shot, I stared at the passing hovercraft and strange creatures from the balcony on the 50th floor, as something nasty began working its way into my bloodstream. At first, I died, soon after we embarked.
