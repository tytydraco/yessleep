Can you imagine God as a thing, instead of simply an idea?

Because that's what God really is, an actual thing, with ideas.

Cherubim, God of the Bible, protector of Eden:

A highly advanced species of Dinosaur.

The last surviving dinosaur species, evolving from the Pterosaur/Pterodactyls.

Same place Dragon legend comes from.


Quetzalcoatl.  


Really, they are Dyno-Soars.


Ask me anything.

For gizzard* stones I offered some rough chunks of metal the size of a baseball or so, crudely hewn silver probably.  The best I could do at the time.  Someone else in my entourage refined this method and formed neatly spiked balls. 

Their first covering early on after rehab was a bright sparkling green forest color.  Their eyes are solid gold color and I wonder if they actually contain alloid. They are way smarter than us.

  I'm glad we have enough knowledge of our environment now to where I can give an apt description.  Try explaining the concept of the Cretaceous period to someone a thousand years ago.

  They used to target my tribe specifically it seemed like.  Same as any predator they develop a taste for things.  And that's how I met God.  They whittled us down until I had to go up there, and then the bond was forged.

  A key part of that story:  I'm up there with the last female survivor and I touch one of the quill protrusions, part analyzing and part trying to instigate her to attack, and they shock me to my guts.  Like it was a dog's wound and I just jabbed it for no reason. I connected with this animal.  Anyone who loves animals knows.  I felt great responsibility yet I had no food, relying on cannibalism to get up there.  I couldn't feed myself to it obviously, though I would have if it made sense.

  So while she is basically set down cowering I take one of the dozen or so eggs that are behind her and discreetly remove the contents so I can make a bowl.  Again, I'm feeling worse to get better here.  I cut my arm and bleed into the egg shell and place it in front of her.  I sit down and I'm about to pass out.  She notices the egg and begins screeching crying seeing the cracked egg and thinking the blood is what's left of the baby. 

 The males swoop in to rescue her but see she's fine and they are puzzled.  I pass out.  They must have figured out my intention because next thing I am being rolled around like a sack of potatoes.  They are trying to wake me up.  I am so dehydrated and tired.  It takes some effort but they rouse me.  I need to eat something and there's nothing.  They bring me some meat.  I don't want to but I have to, a means to an end. 

 This was 200,000+ years ago.  I was still dark.  I must have taken water from the bill.  Edit: I can picture it now.  It was wide enough to form a basin, like a sink.  A concept that was new to me at that time.  And I wasn't very eager to drink the water, as it had some kind of acid to it.  It was just a very foreign structure.  But imagine this animal lowering it's head to let you do that. 

I'm also remembering the whole way up there I had the males dive bombing me.  I learned to block out the sound of their warning cries because it was a waste of energy to react to them, frightening as they were.  I would wait until I could sense the air shift from their wings, then be ready.  

This wore them out. It took a lot of energy for them to do that, and we're on a volcanic mountain with limited stuff. I do have a sword too otherwise I wouldn't stand a chance.  I'm the last one alive in my pack and the first one up there to finish the job.  Otherwise it wouldn't have been me.  My flaming sword in dim volcanic light today is this phone
