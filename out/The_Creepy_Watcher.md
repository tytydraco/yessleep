She stood from the hallway in the dead of night. You could see her white dress reflecting from the moonlight in the window. Eyes empty, mouth agape, feet dragging across the wooden floors. I thought I had outgrown her. Children outgrow their imaginary friends right? RIGHT?



I froze as I watched her etch closer. She was heading in my direction. I could see my vision waver and feel my heart pounding. She wasn't a new face to me; but she was all too familiar.



It was as if she knew it was time. Even from a distance I could see her grin forming, contorting her face even more; it looked like a gash that had been left infected, rotting and decaying. Her distorted voice even so quiet as it was seemed like the wails of those who suffer in punishment below us.



I called her "Emily" ; she was my imaginary "guardian" as a child until I realized the haunting truth; she was my watcher. Tormented me as I slept; stood at the foot of my bed; looked over me at my side, then one night hovering over my body like a hanging corpse. Relentlessly present and unwanting to detach. 



There were nights she would play her games. She knew when the nightmares would come. Then she would hold me. Not like a loving mother or sibling would. By the neck; to the throat or at the chest; right at the heart. I could hear her mocking laughter like a perpetrator teasing its victim. She would tighten her grip then at the last moment release me to my wake. 



Over the years she loomed; a predator stalking her prey. I'd catch her at the corner of my eye, feel her cold stare from behind, and her suffocating presence. We would lock eyes unintentionally during dark moments and I could feel her hunger. Her desperation. 



When I was finally old enough I was left alone. Vulnerable and easy. But I wasn't going to go away quietly. 



With all intentions to ignore her, I walked away in the opposite direction; crawled into bed, and closed my eyes. I had every intention to come back out of it; just like I always did every single night. However, tonight felt different; heavy, unnerving, and almost peaceful. Too peaceful. 



I was asleep for what seemed like seconds. I awoke to my sleeping body below me. I fought back; it lay paralyzed. I could win again right? RIGHT? I survived it every time. So why didn't I tonight? My body lay in deep slumber. Not a tear, not a movement, not a twitch. 



She put her searing limb of a like hand on my chest.  I felt violated; like a lifeless body being desecrated. But she didn't stop; there was no conscious. Then came the excruciating realization. She stood next to me; her smile consuming her pale face. Empty eyes mocking me. The watcher now being watched. I was now the hanging corpse. My body her soon to be vessel.
