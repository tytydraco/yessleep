As I walk through the school hall, I feel like I'm the only one here. Everyone else is in their own little groups, talking and laughing. I feel like an outsider, like I don't belong.

I look around, but nothing catches my eye. The walls are plain and the floor is dull. There's nothing interesting here. I keep walking, my footsteps echoing off the walls.

I pass by a few groups of people, but they don't even notice me. I'm just another face in the crowd. I feel invisible, like no one even knows I exist.

I keep walking, my head down and my hands in my pockets. I'm just trying to get through this day without being noticed. I don't want to draw any attention to myself.

Finally, I reach the end of the hall when I heard two of my classmates talking about a secret message in a song. They were so excited to figure out what it meant.

"Do you think it's true?" one of them asked. "Do you think there really is a secret message in the song?"

The other one shrugged. "I don't know, but it sure would be cool if there was. I mean, think about it - what if there was a hidden meaning behind the lyrics?"

I couldn't help but be intrigued by their conversation. I think i finally found something intersted, so I stopped and asked them what they were talking about.

They told me that they had heard about a song of Kanye West that supposedly had a secret message hidden in it. They said that some people thought the lyrics were actually code for something else, but no one had been able to figure out what it was yet.

I was fascinated by this idea and wanted to learn more.

Since then every day, i would put on my headphones and listen to it for hours.

One day, when i was playing the song my best friend, Joe tapped me on the shoulder.

Joe is an avid sports enthusiast. He had been playing basketball since he was a kid, and he was also a member of the track team and had won several medals in both sports.

Joe had an infectious energy that drew people to him. He was always ready to lend a helping hand or give advice to anyone who needed it. He was popular among his peers, and i never know why he like me.

Joe: Hey there, kid. What's up?

Me: Not much. Just listening to some music.

Joe: What kind of music?

Me: It's a song by Kanye West. I think there's a secret message in it.

Joe: Really? What kind of message?

Me: I'm not sure. It's like a hidden meaning that I can't quite figure out.

Joe: Interesting. Do you think it has something to do with the lyrics or the melody?

Me: Maybe both. I've been trying to figure it out but I can't seem to get it.

Joe: Well, sometimes these things take time. Maybe if you listen to it more, the answer will come to you.

I listened to the song over and over again, trying to pick out the words and decipher their meaning.

I looked for patterns in the words and tried to rearrange them in different ways.

After a few days of hard work, I was amazed! I finally figured it out the message!: The Earth is flat!

I couldn't believe it. I always taught that the Earth was round, so this new information was shocking. I started researching the topic and found out that there were actually many people who believed in the Flat Earth Theory.

I was fascinated by this new information and wanted to learn more. I read books, watched documentaries, and talked to people who also believed in the Flat Earth Theory. Eventually, I became a believer myself.

I was so excited about this knowledge that I wanted to share it with others.

I started a blog and wrote about my experiences and findings. Soon, I had a large following of people who shared my beliefs. I had been blogging for months, but it wasn't until I reached one million followers that my blog really took off. I was ecstatic when I saw the number of followers i had gained. i was so proud of myself and the hard work i put into my blog.

A few days later, i received an unexpected email. It was from Kanye West, and the subject line simply read "World must know the truth!"

I opened the email and was surprised to find a message inside. It said:

Dear Friend,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to you because I believe you may be the only one who can help me. I recently came across an old ancient map that show location of the hidden proof of earth being flat. I can\`t go myself because they are observing me. You are the only person i trust

I'm hoping that you may be able to shed some light on this mystery and help me uncover the secrets of earth. Be sure to wear yeezy boots and take some weapon. I will give you 1 million dollars if you succeed.

Sincerely, Kanye West

I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by this unexpected offer. On one hand, I'm excited and grateful for the opportunity, but on the other, I'm scared of the unknown.

I accepted the offer and was send a photo of ancient map. I decided that i need to ask my only friend Joe for help.

Next day, i went to the school and found Joe in the cafeteria. I sat down next to him and started talking about the email.  We chatted for a few minutes about what we had been up to since we last saw each other. Joe had been busy with sports and I had been busy with my blog.

Me: Hey, guess what? I finally decoded the secret message in that song we've been trying to figure out!

Joe: Really? What did it say?

Me: It said "The earth is flat." Isn't that awesome?

Joe: That's amazing!

Me: I've been planning a trip and I was hoping you'd come with me.

Joe: What kind of trip?

Me: I can't tell you where we're going, but I promise it'll be an adventure.

Joe: That sounds interesting, but why should I go with you?

Me: Because it'll be fun! We can become famous, and have an amazing experience. Plus,we can earn a lot of money.

Joe: I dont know man…….

Me: Oh come on you are my only friend you want me to go alone?

Joe: Alright, I'm in!

Me: Ok thx man. I will pick you today at midnight.

Joe: Why so late?

Me: My parents wont let me go, so night is the only option

Joe: ok i will be waiting.

I decided to plan a journe. I started by researching the area, looking for information about the terrain, wildlife, and any potential dangers I might encounter. I also checked the weather forecast to make sure I would be prepared for any changes in the environment.

Once I had all the information I needed, I began to plan my route.I also made sure to bring plenty of supplies, including food, water, and camping gear.

The only problem was that we needed a car to get there. I knew my dad would never let me borrow the car because i am only 14, so I had to take matters into my own hands.

It was night, the perfect time to make my move. I waited until my dad had gone to bed, then I crept out of my room and down the stairs. My dad kept his car keys in the top drawer of his desk, so i snuck into his office and opened the drawer. I grabbed the keys and quickly ran out of the room, feeling a rush of adrenalin. I was shaking with excitement and fear as I opened the garage door.

I had never driven a car before, but I figured it couldn't be too hard. So, I took a deep breath and got in the driver's seat.  I turned the key in the ignition and the engine roared to life. I was off! I slowly put my foot on the gas pedal and the car started to move. It was a strange feeling, but I was getting more comfortable with it as i drove around the neighborhood. I drove around to my friend house, feeling like a real rebel.

Joe: "What the heck?! Is that a police car?! Is that you driving it?!"

Me: "Uh, yeah... I sort of borrowed it."

Joe: "You borrowed it?! What do you mean you borrowed it?!"

Me: "Well, my dad is a cop I didn't exactly ask permission. But I figured it would be okay.

Joe: "Are you insane?! That's a stolen police car! You could get in serious trouble!"

Me: "I know, I know. But I figured no one would notice and I'd be back before anyone did."

Joe: "You've got to take it back right now! Before anyone finds out!"

Me: I mean I can't come back now.

Joe: I don't know, I'm not sure I want to go anymore.

Me: Come on, it'll be fun! There world need to know, we need to help Kanye West.

Joe: Alright, I guess I'll go.

Me: Great! Let's get going then.

We packed up the car and hit the road.

As we drove, i started to relax a bit more. i began to enjoy the feeling of being in control of the car and the freedom that came with it. I had never felt so free before. The freedom of the open road at night…it was amazing. My friend start to relax, too, and before long we were singing along to the Kanye songs and joking around.

We drove for hours, until we finally arrived at our destination. We stepped out of the car and were immediately surrounded by a thick fog that seemed to be coming from nowhere. We looked around but couldn't see more than a few feet in front of us.

Me: We made it! Joe: Finally! What a long drive.

Me :Can you pick up the shotgun from the police car?

Joe: Shotgun?, what do you need it for?

Me: I dont know man Kanye said to take weapons.

Joe: Alright. I'll grab it for you.

Joe pick the shotgun and we set out on the journey. As we walked, i could feel the darkness of the night surrounding us.

The fog was so thick that we could barely make out the trees around us, and the only sound was the occasional chirp of a bird or the rustle of leaves in the wind. We looked around but couldn't see anything.

Me: Wow, this forest is really spooky.

Joe: I know, right? I'm so glad we're together.

Me: Me too. Let's just keep walking and stay close.

Joe: Good idea.

The fog seemed to be getting thicker and thicker, and soon we could barely see a few feet in front of us.

Suddenly, Joe stopped and pointed ahead, a bright light shone down from the sky and illuminated the forest. It was coming from a police helicopter.

Joe: I can't believe the police are chasing us!

Me: Yeah, I know.

Joe: the police must fond out about the car you stole.

Me: We need to find a way to get away from them.

We started to running through the forest, trying to escape from the helicopter that was hovering above us. The sound of the blades was deafening, and I could feel the wind from them blowing my hair back. We were both out of breath, but we kept running, dodging trees and jumping over fallen logs.

The helicopter seemed to be getting closer, and I could hear the police officers shouting at us to stop. We were both scared, but we kept going, determined to get away. We ran for what felt like hours, until finally we reached a clearing.

But then, we heard more strange noises coming from the trees. This time it sounded like someone or something was following us. We started to run, but the noises kept getting closer and closer.

We can hear the police officers behind us, shouting and crashing through the trees.

Joe: I'm scared

Me: I know we have to keep going if we want to get away.

Joe: We keep running until we reach a clearing and then stop to catch our breath.

Finally, we reached a clearing and saw an old abandoned house. The house was in disrepair, with broken windows and a sagging roof. The paint was peeling off the walls and the porch was missing several boards.

Joe: I can't believe we just got away from the police!

Me: I know, that was so close! We were really lucky.

Joe: Yeah, but why did you have to do that in the first place? You know it was a bad idea!

Me: "sorry, but I think we finally found the location on the map! It's right here! See? The abandoned house."

Joe: "We need to go ! The police are still chasing us!"

Me: Ok. Let’s go

We were excited to have found the house, but also a bit scared. We cautiously approached the house and peered inside. The interior was dark and musty, with cobwebs everywhere. We could see furniture covered in dust and a staircase leading to the second floor.

The house had been abandoned for years, and it look like no one had dared to enter it since.

The wind howled through the trees, and the rain pounded against the windows of the house. It seemed to be calling out to someone, inviting them to come inside. I opened the door and stepped inside, but something felt off.

Me: Wow, this place looks spooky.

Joe: Yeah, it's a bit creepy. I'm not sure if I want to go in.

Me: Come on, let's just take a look around. We'll be fine.

Joe: Alright, but let's stay close together. Me: Sure thing. Let's go!

Part 2 - coming soon
