*You don’t need to know me. All you need to know is I know something. Something I shouldn’t. It’s not mine to tell, but I don’t think dead girls complain much. I see through her eyes, I feel that same pain. More than a memory, I live in the moments, every second of every day. I have never been religious, but I pray to whatever will listen. I will tell her story, I know I have to. I don’t know why, but someone has to hear her side of the story.*



“Just promise you won't leave me. We’ll stay together, alright?”

“Yeah, whatever. I promise,” she said, as she slid her uniform off. I sat waiting, having already changed out of my work clothes the second my shift ended. Working in the theater had some perks, but it was hardly worth smelling like popcorn butter after. Rachel put perfume over the smell, but I showered after every shift. My hair was still damp as proof.

“Do you need anything before we leave?” she asked, pulling clothes out of her bag to change into. 

“Probably,” I joked, trying to break my own tension, “but it’s my house, so if it’s that important I’ll notice it on my way out.”

She laughed, buttoning the last of four buttons on her jeans. Then she threw on a tight ringer tee-shirt. Previously it had some sort of image, but it had worn away with time leaving it difficult to make out. I dressed nearly the opposite, with a plaid yellow skirt, and matching button up top. A brown belt, with a gold shining buckle and hoop earring to match. We weren’t the type to be friends, really we shouldn’t have been. Work does that, brings different types of people together. 

Rachel hopped off the edge of my bed, grabbing her bag off my floor. She started out my door, forgetting her keys on my nightstand

“Rachel,” I laughed, picking up the keys and following her out, “you won't make it far without these.”

She smiled, took the keys, and continued without a word. 

Her car was parked on the sidewalk in front of my house. I was never good with cars, but I knew for sure it was black. I think it was a cutlass, but I wouldn’t bet on it. She got into the driver's seat, but I hesitated. I didn’t want to get in with her. I was scared, but it was too late. She planned all this out, I couldn't ruin it for her. So, against my better judgement, I buckled myself into the passenger seat. 

*If only she knew.*

The drive there was odd. Even Main Street had no traffic. Leaving it a graveyard of stoplights, and fallen leaves. Fog, blocking our view from every direction. Growing thicker and thicker the further out of town we went. I would have expected more traffic with the carnival, but maybe all of the hustle and bustle happened already. Maybe we were late or something. I twiddled my thumbs, pretending as though I had nothing to worry about. 

“You okay?” Rachel asked, not taking her attention off the road. She always pointed out my little quirks, usually noticing if I was feeling off.

“Mhm,” I squeaked, snapping out of whatever trance I was in. I was—obviously—not okay.

Rachel glanced over; she looked so calm and relaxed. “You sure? You look hella tense.”

I didn’t answer. Cool air flooded in through Rachel’s window, letting the smoke off her cigarette float out. Flickering neon lights stopped her before she could push any further. The lights lured us into an open field turned parking lot, like an anglerfish lures its prey. The old beauty, suffocated by the call of humming engines. ‘**The Funhouse**’ bright, bold, colorful, hung upon the gateway. It looked so new and bright, as if maybe they'd just bought it today. I fumbled for the door handle, unable to muster up the strength to get it open. Vision fuzzy, heart pounding, and a headache I couldn’t seem to shake off. Rachel came around and opened the door for me. I tumbled out, nearly knocking her over with me.

I think she asked me something. I don't know. I blanked, as if someone had burnt every last page in my mind. I got up and walked towards the entrance. It was too much. The lights. The laughing. The small crowded paths. But a calm smile and happy voice were as good of an act as the rest of the circus. I had never snuck out before. I was my parents ideal child, and I loved it. The way every adult mentioned me as a role model, it kept me going. Like a push I needed to function. 

Rachel grabbed my arm, pulling me towards the ring toss. 

“Would you be careful!” I begged as she pulled me past a girl, nearly sending her flying. Looking at the girl, she was younger, maybe 10 or 11. She looked, odd? There was no other way to describe it. She dressed as though a few years behind style; a pale multicolored striped shirt, and bright blue pants. Oddly, she had a microvision? They stopped making those back in 1981, if I remember right. But with how often Lance and Hyde mention it, how could I forget. That is only three years ago though,  so it’s not too odd she has one. Looking around, everyone looked a few years behind. It was uncanny, but perhaps it was just my wild imagination. Rachel didn’t seem to notice, maybe it was nothing to worry about? Trying to find a good distraction, we played every game in reach. We, of course, won nothing. 

*In the carnival, the house always wins.*

A blaring announcement shook my attention away from the horse race I had been playing.

“The show will commence in 10 minutes. 10 minutes.” droned the announcer  "Stock up on snacks, carnival trinkets, and secure a prime seat. And, of course, don't forget to enjoy the show." His tone implied that the enjoyment part was optional, but the snacks and trinkets were not. 

Rachel, again grabbed my wrist, pulling me towards the tent. "Come on, we have to get in before the show starts!" My heart was racing, my breath coming in short gasps as I stumbled after her. We past all the game I had played, which oddly enough looked older than they had moments ago. Looking more closely the grounds were almost empty. Where there had been many people moments ago, now all that wandered were the soulless carnival employees. 

The tent looked too small on the outside, and I assumed me and Rachel would be stuck on the sidelines without chairs for being late. I closed my eyes as I walked in, but it did nothing. Sweat, grease, and other smells didn’t help my nerves. The air inside the tent was too thick to breathe. Without hesitation; Rachel threw herself towards the stairs, dragging me up behind her. Our feet pounded a rhythm against the weathered boards. I held my breath, begging myself not to feel sick. I failed, watery vomit splattered against the wooden steps.

“Woah,” she let go of my hand, covering her own mouth as if she might as well be sick too, “are you sure you're alright?”

I choked on my words, I wasn’t alright. 

“Yeah,” I managed, before continuing up the stairs. It was too late to back out now. We stumbled over feet trying to find open seats, but eventually we found what seemed to be the last two in the tent. As if time itself were waiting for us, the show started. The music swelled, and the crowd erupted into cheers as the lights dimmed like embers in a dying fire pit.  

A single ray guided the eyes of the crowd towards the center of the ring. Then you saw him, one of the many clowns. He could have passed for ordinary, but he had long lost that privilege. A nice white button up shirt, offset by his bright red pants and bow tie to match. His proportions were all wrong, like a child’s drawing of a person. He had prosthetics; they were wooden, all different shades and types. Like he was made purely by the creator's twisted euphoria for torture. 

*The effect? Like a train wreck you couldn’t look away from.* 

“Hello boys and girls, welcome to the Funhouse!”  He cheered, arms waving through the air like a weird vintage cartoon character. His tone was weirder, like a voice box. Barely matching his mouth as he spoke. It didn’t fit him. It was pitchy, too high; as if he’d sucked all the helium from a balloon. “Here is where your dreams come true, just wait! You’ll see wonders of the world, mysteries never to be answered, and the most incredible tricks performed by our amazing actors. Now give a round of applause for the dancers!”

He stepped back and the stage darkened, as if he were the light keeping it lit. As if they had been there the whole time, they began their dance. Like shining dots in the dark, all emitting a light of their own. Their motions pulled the audience into awe. Dark blue leotards tightly clung to their bodies, black ruffles dancing beneath their skirts. Defying gravity, every leap, just moments too long. Their ruffled skirts gave the effect of a black swan, leaping from water. Beautiful dark red ribbons in hand, the shade of long oxidized blood. They spun through hoops so quickly they sparked. Contrast to the world of the carnival, they were angels.

After they finished their dance, they seemed to vanish. The ring, now lit up, showed 4 large trapeze ropes and 2 poles on opposite sides, stalking the stage for the next who dared to take its place. The additional lighting showed how large the tent really was. It hadn’t appeared this big on the outside, only a few hundred feet. Looking at it now, it had to be at least a thousand feet around, maybe more. 

A young woman and man climbed up on opposite platforms. Their eyes locked. They had similar attire to the dancers, but no skirts or ribbons to match. They looked similar, both slim brunette haired, what I can only guess were siblings. They stood still for a moment, as if waiting for some sort of introduction. Without one, she stepped backwards to get a running start, and dove. Her hands slammed against the bar, gripping tight as she swung towards her male counterpart. Time seemed to slow. She looked so focused, so certain. She trusted her every move, and her partner just as much. As she neared him, the lights cut, drenching the world in dim, red, darkness.

*Silence. It’s frightening. The world isn’t meant to be quiet. Silence is predator stalking prey. It's calm before the storm. Silence is pain in the making.*

A scream. The kind that causes nightmares, and makes ears ring. One that speaks a million words, hopes, and dreams, then crushes them all in a second. A scream of pain, loss, and knowing. 

*Knowing, that you cannot win the game of life. That no matter what, life remains the constant victor. Without words, you knew what she begged. Screaming is the one language everyone speaks.*

The lights snapped back on, but the scream didn’t stop. The tent shuddered with the silence of the audience, only the screaming. Looking around, they were gone. Even the male trapeze had vanished, just like everyone else; disappeared, to dirt across the floor, and the fear that she might not be alone. Looking ahead, she saw her. Crushed by the pressure of her fall. The last moments of terror, still frozen in her eyes. Limbs twisted in each direction, like a gory broken compass guiding me nowhere.  The dirt beneath her, a damp red. Her corpse, still screaming.

The first normal scream, mine. Frozen in place, everything seemed to unfold before me like a movie. And for a moment I prayed I was a part of the narrative. My knees gave way, sending me to the floor, barely leaving me conscious through the fear induced nausea. It was too sudden, too real. 

The woman’s screaming continued, beyond what her crushed torso should have allowed. Then, as if fate had pity on me for a moment; blood gurgled up her throat, slowly muffling her agony. Leaning my shaking body against a chair, I looked towards where the door was. Fate did not pity me, it distracted me. Distracted, so it could do something much worse.

The door had vanished with no trace left behind, as if it had never been there at all. I looked around, and saw what I should have known far before. There was no way out. 

Running down the stairs, I slipped and was reminded of my fear induced vomit, now covering my yellow skirt. Nearing the bottom of the steps, I stopped. A sound echoed throughout the air, stopping me in my tracks. Skittering on the roof.

Then I saw it. It tore through the roof of the tent with ease, but no light came in. A dark shade of grey-brown, fifty maybe sixty feet long wrapping itself around the polls holding the place up. Ten long spider-like limbs stuck randomly to the body—as if added as an afterthought—all shifting as if they had minds of their own. Two sockets where the eyes should have been, pulling the skin around them in like a black hole.  It’s smile, grotesque, and mangled. The ends wrapped around edges of its head, showing horribly large, sharpened human teeth.

Moving faster than my eyes could catch up with, it darted toward me. I dropped back to the floor. Sliding down the stairs, I scratched any available surface of skin. It slammed into the steps above me, and crawled down right past me. It couldn’t see.

I crawled along the seat bottoms. Shaking every second I wasn’t pressed to the floor. It may not have been able to see me, but it could hear my every breath.

After more than an hour of crawling, hiding, holding my breath, and repeating that vicious cycle, I reached a curtain. Barely open enough for me to fit through silently, I crawled in. Too frightened to breathe, for the fear it might hear me, I ran further inside. Hardly seeing where I was going, I ran in and out of every curtain and opening. Praying for an escape. Each direction I tried left me more and more hopeless. After many failed attempts at tearing through the tent, and looking behind every crate and rack I could find, I crumbled to the floor. 

Tears streamed down my cheeks, I hadn’t taken the time to realize what really was destined to happen. I was not going to escape. I was stuck here, to rot away, or die to that horrible monster outside this curtain. I had so much left to do, I wasn’t ready to die. The thoughts hurt, and I pressed my nails into my palm.

I heard it scurry across the ground outside, it hadn’t forgotten I was there. I pressed my nails deeper into my skin, drawing blood. It wasn’t good, but it took the pain in my head away. Helping me focus my brain on something other than fear I couldn’t control. Through my blurred vision, I saw a slightly open crate I was too panicked to notice before. Wiping my eyes, I walked over. Sliding the lid off, I looked inside. Human-sized doll parts. Some wooden, others porcelain. Like those on the clown from the start of the show. I picked one up to look at, just to see what they were. It was hollow. I slid the arm over my own, putting each finger into the correct slot. A perfect fit. The porcelain was cold on my skin, but the freckles dotted on it seemed to match my own. Each finger was built to bend, carefully crafted as if put together by hand. Moving my arm was comfortable, as if it was made for me. Putting it back, I stepped quietly back towards my spot on the floor. Then I felt it. Something moved from out in the ring.

I stepped towards the curtain, making sure to stay out of sight of the thing I knew was out there. I glanced out into the dark, not wanting to see it looking back at me. A dim ray from the torn roof was the only light. In that light were scattered chairs, one of the trapeze poles—now broken— and the door. The same as how it had been before, as if it had never left. 

Without thought, I ran.

My shoes pounded the dirt, echoes following me like bees to flowers. I was so close—close to safety, freedom, to the life I feared I’d lose tonight. Hope struck my heart. 

*What strikes harder than hope? Something sharp.*

Just seconds away from the door, my stomach dropped. I was jerked back, my limbs crunched together by the grip of that thing. 

Mustering my last bit of strength, I got one look at it—him. One. He looked *human,* more than he had before. Almost as if turning more human as he watched me suffer. Then, my soon-to-be lifeless body was gouged into a broken trapeze pole. 

Slow, steady, dripping. Blood. My breathing labored through my punctured lungs. It hurt, not like you’d imagine. Like swallowing chlorine at the pool, the choking, nausea, all the same. But it wasn’t as quick. It lingered, like vinegar on my tongue.

“Goodbye Marylin,” a voice, walking towards me. Rachel, my co-worker, classmate, someone I considered my friend.

Rachel stared at my dying body, and I realized she had no choice. She was a puppet, doing as she was told. I saw it, the way she bowed her head. She didn’t really want this. But I couldn’t form the words to convince her otherwise. 

*Marylin’s breathing slowed. Maybe she had been hallucinating, maybe not. But in her last moments, I swear I saw her killer become man. Then her breath grew slower, and slower. The worst part about all of this, I don't get a death ending. No easy way out.* 



“Good,” the man said,  as he lifted her corpse off of the pole. Her limbs drooped as blood coated her skin. “You will remain here until we find him. Do I make myself clear Rachel?”   

Her head nodded in compliance, her voice hardly above a whisper, “Of course father, my work has been done.”

He had good plans for her body. Stitching her wounds, removing limbs to make place for those same antique toy parts she had seen before. Predicting her own demise. Her eyes sewn open, dark blue buttons in their place. Marylin, a name of the past, a life left behind. A new name, but the same old girl. 

*Madame Louise, the marionette doll*.



*I don’t know who she is, and I don’t know why I know her story. But whoever she may be; God have mercy on Marylin.*
