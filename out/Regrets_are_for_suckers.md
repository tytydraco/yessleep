Death by cop is not the picture-perfect ending I imagined. I lay here surrounded by news photographers who shamelessly snap photos as I bleed to death on the steps of the city bank. Looking down I watch as my blood bubbles out of the multiple bullet holes scattered across my torso. It is not a glamorous death, but I've seen worse deaths. You know, I'm no doctor, but I'm pretty sure my lungs have collapsed. I nearly drowned once as a kid and right now it feels like I am drowning on copper flavoured thick water. Oh wait, ha, that’s my blood.

 

 It's almost pretty, yanno, how my blood is flowing down the boring, grey, bank steps. Abstract art - I think I finally understand it. I chuckle, blood spits from my mouth as I do. The metallic taste of it reminds me I am dying which is rather somber. A large paramedic stands over me. A real ugly son of a bitch. His jaw looks like it was reconstructed several times. Acne scars stain his cheeks and chin. His teeth are sharp, jagged, and black. And his eyes! Horse shit brown. The poor bastard must have had siblings for parents. He looked like God threw his DNA in a blender and pressed 'Grind'. 

 

I laugh again at the thought which makes me cough in pain. The forceful coughing splatters my blood all over the ugly paramedic. I laugh louder. The last thing I remember from Earth is that ugly mother fuckers smile disintegrating as my blood dripped off his deformed chin. 

 

So - here I am. At the gates of heaven awaiting my fate. To say that I am surprised I'm not burning in hell now is a HUGE understatement. On Earth I was not exactly a law-abiding citizen. I prefer law avoiding citizen thank you very much. Hell, I died fleeing a bank robbery that I initiated. I would have gotten off scott free if that security guard didn't try to play hero. 


One bullet to the head and playing hero was the last game that guard ever played. He's not the first person I've killed either. I've got quite the wrap. My first kill was as a kid, but no one wants to hear that garbage. I got a tattoo for every human life I've taken. 6 to be exact. A few civilians that looked at me wrong. Once I took a knife to a guy who resisted me stealing his car. Stupid. He deserved it. I don't feel bad about the lives I took, none of them. Regrets are for suckers. I know my choices may not have been ethical to those who have ethics. I'm not that guy. Still, finding myself outside these here holy gates does bring me some intrigue.

 

If they keep me waiting much longer, I'll have to start a commotion. I can't stand waiting. Especially with this little old lady in front of me muttering nonsense about seeing her Bernie again after all these years. Give me a break. 

 

"Corey Hector Terari". A babe in a white robe called angelic like. "That's me sweetheart" I assert while shoving the old lady in front of me to the side. She falls to the floor, bouncing a little. Another laugh leaves my lips as I watch her stare around wide eyed in surprise. Striding forward I flash this babe my best grin. She frowns but I'm sure that's just her being coy. Reaching up I slick my thick black hair back with the palms of my calloused hands giving her a view of my bulging biceps. "You beckoned, I'm here darling" I tease with a wink.

 

 Babe turned on her heel without another word. *Bitch is playing hard to get* I think to myself as she leads me into a private room. "Oh honey, aren't you going to buy me dinner first?" I muse. Her lips tighten into a stern, pinched, smile. "This is the judging room Corey. Here it will be decided where you go next". I could listen to this babe talk all day I think to myself as she goes on and on about something this and something that. Her curves were cut by God himself I just knew it. All the ugly that paramedic had was because this babe got all his pretty. "Damn you're fine" I blurt out. An unimpressed expression crosses her lips, which annoys me. Even the women in heaven play hard to get, I hate that.

 

"A thank you would be nice Kitten" I assert. Without prompt she lunges forward and grips my neck with her ice-cold hand. The icy grip catches me off guard. I imagined her touch to be a warm one. I expected her to be warm... she leans in real close, and whispers "every entity you've ever wronged will be deciding your fate".

 

*White room*

 

 I swallow hard. A sensation fills my body, an emotion I've not felt since childhood. Fear. The chill of her hand turns hot without warning. I feel my skin begin to boil and peel. The pain is agonizing. A smirk pulls at the corner of her mouth when my skin crackles aloud. Releasing me she steps back with a laugh. Rage fills me and I lunge forward towards the bitch. She snaps her fingers and she's gone. My momentum carries me forward and I fall into a mirrored wall I hadn't noticed before.

 

“Fuck, that bitch!” I scream. My screams echo in the empty room while I examine the blistering handprint painting my neck. Pus and blood spit from my wounds painting the mirror with splatter. With shaky hands my fingers examine the damage. The softest graze of my digits on the wound makes me recoil. The burn is so intense it makes me want to fall to my knees. Each inhale makes me lightheaded. This is worse than the time I was knifed in the stomach during my stint in Juvey.

 

The room is empty aside from this mirror. Everything is so white. It's blinding. I wipe the pain fueled tears from my eyes which is when I notice black specs twitching in the handprint singed into my neck. "The fuck?" I mutter while stepping closer to the mirror. My eyes narrow on the black specs trying to identify them. Each movement of the specs across my neck intensifies the pain. More black specs appear. My eyes widen with disbelief as spec after spec crawls out of my wound. 


A realization dawns on me as I feel the specs tunnelling out of my exposed veins. The burn has been colonized by ants. A real manly like scream leaves my lips as the ants bite at my exposed flesh, feeding on me. My hands slap them away which brings me to my knees in pain. Each time I touch my neck my entire body shudders in agony. My blisters leak as ants feast on me, they flow down the length of my neck in a river of blood and pus. Some ants crawl up my face into my nostrils, eyes, and ears. It's too much, even for a tough guy like me.

 

Surrendering to the assault I fall to the floor and effortlessly slap the ants away. They are multiplying too fast. It hurts to swat them away. It hurts when they bite. I twitch on the floor, my hands balled into fists. I try not to scream now, too many ants have filled my mouth. I can taste the pus on their bodies. I roll over and vomit blood, ants, and stomach acid all over the pristine white floor. "Make it stop" I plead.

 

The room turns dark. Only to be illuminated by the heat of the sun. The glass ceiling magnifying the intensity of the burn. Immediately my skin begins to redden. The ants panic and the biting increases. The ants run for cover, filling all my orifices. Have you ever gagged on ants before? Not ideal. I can hardly breath so many ants are in my nostrils and throat. The heat from above burns hotter. Slowly I'm being cooked... the same way I used to cook ants as a kid.

 

The realization is a slap to the face I tell yeah. I’m being punished for killing ants as a little bastard kid? Stupid. My entire body is covered with third degree burns. I can smell myself baking; feel myself being eaten. Frothing from the mouth in pain my eyes roll back. Every muscle in my being begins to twitch uncontrollably. A puddle of melted flesh forms beneath me. I attempt to roll onto my back but am glued in place by my own skin. That's the last thing I remember before waking up in the red room.

 

*Red Room*

 

A gasp for air pulls me awake. I expect to feel a flood of pain any second now, but no pain comes.  Sitting up straight I look down at my body and see my normal pink flesh. I grip my neck with my large hands and the angelic bitch’s handprint is no longer there. Panicking I stick a finger up my nose in search of ants. None. I spit on the floor beside me and again there are no ants. I sigh loudly with relief at the realization that I am now safe. Safe from the ants biting my flesh and penetrating my body. Safe from the burning scent of myself cooking. I should feel relieved at these revelations, but my heart is pounding in my chest. The panic of not knowing if there are ants still inside me have me in a craze. Standing up on shaky legs I wander the seemingly empty room. It is a perfect circle with no visible ceiling. It is dark looking up. Eerily dark. The red walls remind me of the burns that covered my body in the white room. 



 I shudder and close my eyes tightly trying to block the memory of pain from my mind.  I was safe now. “Safe?”  A mocking voice echoes my private thought aloud. “Corey Hector Terrari, you are a fool if you think you are safe”. I recognized the voice by the condescending tone. “Hello Grandmother” I growl through gritted teeth.

 

A little background here.  My grandmother was a tough old broad. Cruel as she was tall, I tell yeah. She was a biker chick in her hay-day.  She ran the clubhouse with violence.  No one disrespected grandmother and no one dare cheat her of her valuables. Well no one, but me that is. I cheated that old bitty any chance I could. Tank Terrari is what they called her, Tank for short. Tank would leave stacks of cash all over the club house table. She knew exactly how much money was there. Each day this stack got bigger and bigger. See Tank wanted to test the loyalty of the people who worked for her. 



So, each day the kitchen table got swallowed with piles of bills to the point the table legs started to buckle. No one touched Tank’s money after the first guy attempted to rob her.  That poor bastard ended up with broken femurs, collarbones, missing fingers, and the title of biker house gimp until the day he died of internal organ failure. Did that scare me? Nope. I wanted a new lease on life and Tank’s cash stack was my way out. So, one night I did what any loving grandson would do. I drugged Tank with sleeping pills. Slipped them right into her evening tea.  Then when she passed out, I slit her throat. I squatted beside her bed and watched her gasp for her last breath, smiling as she drifted into forever sleep. She died giving me the bird. Classy Tank, very classy. 

 

After she died, I went downstairs and told the bikers that Tank wanted me to move all the money. I told them Tank expected a police raid to be coming soon and she didn’t want her precious money seized. Those dumb fucks helped me pack up all the cash into duffel bags. They even loaded it into a club SUV for me. They waved me off under the impression I was transporting Tank’s cash to another hideout. Morons. I split with that cash as soon as my taillights were out of sight. It was hilarious watching them shrink in the rearview mirror as I drove off with all their ‘hard earned’ money.

 

“Are you done reminiscing on your betrayal Corey?” Tank’s voice asked bluntly.  “Listen Grandmother you had it coming, if it wasn’t me, it would have been someone else. You should be happy family was the one who sent you to your maker” I retorted matter of fact. A chill filled the room making me hug myself tightly for warmth.  “Do you remember what happens to little boys who misbehave Corey?” her voice cut through my ears like a blade.

 

 Talk about twisted, this broad used to lock me in the deep freezer, but only after she hosed me down outback. I would pound on the roof of the freezer until my knuckles were bruised and raw. The door wouldn’t budge, and I’d have to accept my fate. I would hug myself tightly in the freezer as the hose water began to freeze all around me. My wet clothes and hair were the first to form icicles. It felt like hours in that freezer. Sometimes I would be laying on top of a body she was waiting to dismember; some poor fucker that wronged her. So, there was little me laying atop of a dead body freezing to death in my grandmother’s deep freeze. She eventually let me out and sent me to my room in the attic where I’d spend the next few days recovering from frostbite with little to no food. Like I said, no one wronged Tank Terrari.

 

I thought maybe it was my imagination that the red room was getting significantly colder until I could see my own exhales in the frosty air. “I should have never let you out of that freezer Corey” she hissed. “Don’t do this Tank” I pleaded but it was too late. The red walls began to shift revealing the white walls of grandmother’s freezer. The circle room began to close in around me. Immediately I began to sweat with claustrophobia. The air got colder so fast it was hard to adjust. A loud clunk sounded from above, like creaky pipes, before a rainstorm of cold hose water began to rain over me. The walls were so close to me I was forced into a standing up right position. They were so cold it felt like my skin was getting burned every time my skin grazed against the walls. Icicles began to form all over my body.  The hose water began to fill the cylinder I was now stuck in. It hurt. The cold hurt. I could no longer move at all. The walls closed so tightly around me it was difficult to breath. The water was up to my knees. Ice chunks were floating around beneath me.


 “Grandmother, enough” I pleaded knowing that she was no longer listening. From above the door was closing. A circular ceiling was being lowered over my head, stopping only when it firmly pressed down on the top of my scalp. The fear I felt as a child was so prominent now. I was going to die in this cylinder coffin, frozen, and wet. My teeth were chattering so hard I felt they may break and ruin my handsome smile. I could no longer feel my legs as the cold water reached my thighs. I inhaled sharply as the water level rose to my crotch sending a wave of displeasure shooting through my being. “You’re a cruel bitch Tank” I shivered as my body began to feel nothing at all. 


The numbness came so fast, sleep was fast approaching. The water stopped rising when it reached my hips. The walls began to open giving me more space. I sighed in relief. The relief was replaced with panic when the bodies of my grandmothers’ enemies began to float to the surface. They were frozen solid, yet somehow alive. Their ice-cold hands began grabbing at me. Their fists pulling me beneath the water. I tried fighting them but was frozen in place like a statue. Water began filling my lungs.  The last bit of warmth left in me surrendering to the cold.  Pain was all my brain recognized now. So much pain. The hands pulled me down to the bottom of the cylinder room and that is where Tank was waiting for me.  A wretched smile spread across her face she approached me. “You stole from me you little Shit” she growled. The frozen men held me tightly - grandmother slit my throat.

 

*Blue Room*

 

 A bright flash of blue pulled me awake. “The fuck?” I asked aloud while starring up a disturbingly vibrant light. Sucking in air I attempt to reach up to inspect the slit grandmother and her frozen goons left on my neck, only to find my movements restricted. Claustrophobia set in again and I feel hot with panic. On the plus side, I no longer feel cold or wet. I flex my biceps and triceps trying to fight the straps holding me down. It is then that I realize my torso and legs are also pinned by thick leather straps.

 

 

 “Welcome to the Blue room Corey” a mysterious voice cooed.  “How are you enjoying your stay?” he asked mockingly. “Unstrap me and ask me again you fuck” I growl back. *How am I enjoying my stay? What a little bitch asking me something like that when I am strapped down against my will.* “Haha! No, no. I think I like you secured to the gurney Corey, I won’t be unstrapping you anytime soon” the mysterious voice responded. 



I look towards the sound of the voice. I see a man with a blood-soaked shirt emerge from the shadowed corner of the bright blue room. The first thing I notice is a knife protruding from his stomach. I recognize the knife immediately. It was my Damascus steel hunting bowie knife, 12” in length with a custom handle. I stole it during a bar fight, it was one of my favourite possessions. Well, it was before I had to leave it at the scene of a crime. See, I was relieving a car from this schmuck, and he resisted. What else was I supposed to do? I needed a car and this guy had one. So, I stabbed him in the stomach with my Bowie. Deserved really. It’s not my fault the guy bled out and died on scene. The shitty part about it all? Before I even made it out of the county the damn car ran out of gas.  I set it ablaze in a conservation field before splitting on foot. It was nice to see my knife again, brought back a lot of memories.

 

The man saw me starring at the knife and interrupted my reminiscing “the last time we met you buried this knife in my abdomen”. He smiled at me and then started a boring dialogue “you see before you stabbed me and stole my car, I was a successful surgeon. I dedicated my life to healing others.  The day you murdered me I was on my way to the hospital to watch my wife deliver our first child. A little girl I never met thanks to you. I bet you can imagine how upset this made me as I laid in the middle of the road bleeding to death” he paused to secure a strap across my forehead securing my head down to the gurney which forced me to stare up at the blue ceiling.


 “I bet she grew up to be a real beauty doc” I retorted with a wink. The doctor put his finger to my lips and shushed me. He leaned in real close to my ear whispering “if you don’t stay quiet, I will be forced to suture your mouth shut”.

 

 “You took my life from me, and I am going to enjoy showing you how much pain that caused me Corey” the doc said.  Then the psycho wrapped his hand around the handle of the bowie knife imbedded in his gut and slowly pulled it out inch by inch. Weird that not a single drop of blood was on the shimmering steel blade. With a sigh he inspected the blade up close. With dead eyes the doc walked out of my eyeline. He clinked the steel blade against my bare foot. I flinched as he began to slice the inseam of my worn Levi jeans with precision. The doc began to remove my jeans with ease, followed by the slicing and removal of my shirt. 



The bastard left me laying on the gurney in nothing but my boxers. “Woah now doc, let’s discuss this – yanno I don’t swing that way. It is a compliment; you’ve got a nice grill and all, but I’m just not interested” I muse with a chuckle trying to lighten the mood. Ignoring me, the doc dragged the tip of the knife along the inside of my bare thigh towards my low hanging fruit making me swallow hard. This doc is armed with a blade, has a thirst for vengeance, and I am immobilized. I decide its best if I stay quiet. The sharp blade cut through the fabric of my boxers exposing my naked flesh, leaving me completely exposed and vulnerable.

 

 

I shiver with fear as he taps the steel blade against the metal gurney menacingly.  “Don’t worry Corey nothing to be ashamed of. It was a little chilly in the last room” he laughs to himself while dragging the tip of the knife across my bare pelvic bones.  “Fuck you doc. I am twice the man you are. If you gave me the car like I demanded, you would be alive watching your daughter grow up.  Instead, you’re holding a grudge against me for your own stupidity”. Again, the doc raised his finger to his lips reminding me to be quiet.

 

Without even a warning the doc raised the bowie high in the air and slammed it deep into my abdomen. A real manly like cry left my mouth as the pain flooded my brain. I’ve been stabbed before, no big deal really, but for some reason this hurt more than usual. There was a burning sensation paired with the stabbing pulse of the blade.  The doc’s mouth pulled up into a small smile. “Acid” he answered without needing to be asked. With one strong pull the knife emerged from my abdomen dripping with my crimson red blood. “You are one sick fuck doc” I grimaced through grinding teeth. “No Corey, that would be you” he spat back at me. “When you left me for dead in the middle of the street, I had everything to lose. You had no one. Everyone who ever tried to care about you, you managed to kill, rob, or cheat. You did not deserve life more than me”.

 

The doctor slammed the Bowie back into my abdomen on the opposite side of my belly button. This time he covered my mouth with the palm of his free hand to stifle my scream. The doc pressed down into my face with his full force as he twisted the knife into my abdomen with his other hand. He continued moving the knife, slicing at my muscles and organs with the acid-soaked blade.  I can feel the acid eating me, suddenly I missed the ants. I flex and struggle against the leather straps attempting to relieve the burning igniting my insides. “You know stabbing someone in the abdomen has a high survival rate – it doesn’t necessarily mean death. But you, you stabbed me right in the stomach. You twisted the blade inside me. You held me close to you and stared me in the eye while my stomach acid spilled out over my intestines. It burned Corey. 


 The acid burned so much. You dropped me to the pavement like a heap of trash. Drove off in my car and left me to die. Do you even care about the repercussions of your actions at all?” the doc asked while yanking the bowie from my stomach. He stepped away from the gurney and stared down at me waiting for an answer.

 

I winced as the acid chewed through my raw flesh before mustering a response “regrets are for suckers doc. You should have just given me what I wanted” I sneer through gritted teeth as the acid continued to seer my insides. The doctor sighed a deep exhale like my answer disappointed him or something. “One thing I couldn’t understand as I laid their dying was why the stab wound burned so intensely Corey. It was only after I died that I discovered you had stupidly decided to dip the blade in battery acid to clean the blood off it from your last victim. When you stabbed this knife into me it burned my insides with corrosive battery acid. The stab wound itself, I could have survived. But the battery acid coating my sliced insides. I boiled from the inside out”.  

 

“Like I said doc, it could have all been avoided if you just gave me the car when I asked”. With a deep frown the doc bent down out of sight, he began fumbling under the gurney. Only a moment passed before he was standing over me with a syringe full of a colourless liquid. He hovered the syringe over my stab wound to the left of my belly button and slowly released one drop of the colourless liquid into the wound. I swear it sizzled when the drop impacted with my exposed flesh. I yelled and squirmed against the gurney, using all my muscles to try and break free of the leather straps “Fuck you doc!” is all I managed before another drop fell from the syringe. I winced in agony as the liquid flowed through my exposed stab wound. The doc moved his hand to hover over my second stab wound and let several drops of the liquid fall from the syringe. Have you ever smelled yourself burning? It is damn gross. Bile filled my throat; I needed the torture to end. “Battery acid is incredibly painful, isn’t it Corey?” the doc asked expressionless.

 

The pain was too much. A cold sweat covered my skin, and the bright blue ceiling began to fade to dark. “Ah, ah Corey not yet” the doc said as he waved smelling salts under my nose to prolong my agony. For what felt like hours the doc continued to drip battery acid into my two stab wounds. When I would pass out, he would force smelling salts under my nose. I laid, constrained, burning alive from the inside. My own flesh corroding as the acid trickled through my abdomen. The pain was horrendous. What made it worse was the doc spent the whole time narrating what his life would have been like if it hadn’t been for me stabbing him.  Like, get over it!? Amiright?  The last thing I remember of the bright blue room is the doctor sobbing in the corner like a baby as my naked body convulsed and collapsed onto the table, burnt from the inside out.

 

Judges room

 

 

*Judge 1: “He has been through three rooms and isn’t showing any signs of remorse. I say we send him to the final room now for the last test”.*

 

*Judge 2: “The procedure is five rooms and then the final room. You know that”.*

 

*Judge 1: “This is not a standard test subject. At room two most test subjects ask for forgiveness to some degree. Corey has shown us no signs that he will ask for forgiveness. In his own words “Regrets are for suckers”. We are wasting valuable time – fast track him to the final room!”*

 

*Judge 2: “But – it is not procedure”.*

 

*Judge 1: “He has chosen death 3 times now! Enduring the pain and torture instead of choosing to repent for his sins”.*

 

*Judge 3: “Enough arguing! Judge 2. What are the next two rooms”?*

 

*Judge 2: “In the 4th room Corey will be met by two men whom he killed in a bar fight. The same men he stole the Bowie knife from that killed the doctor. The two men will beat Corey with soldering hot brass knuckles that will brand him with the word ‘repent’ over and over until he dies or repents”.*

 

*“In the 5th room Corey will be tested by the security guard whom he shot point blank, execution style at the bank robbery. Corey will be forced to play Russian roulette with the same gun. Each time the bullet fails to shoot Corey dead, Corey will be asked to repent. Each time he refuses he will be submerged into a bath of boiling water until he perishes from either the burns or the bullet if he does not repent”.*

 

*Judge 1: “Why waste our time with this Corey Hector Terrari! I say we push forward to the final room. When he fails, we can be rid of his treacherous soul”.*

 

*Judge 2: “The procedure says….”*

 

*Judge 3: “We will proceed to the final room. We have given Corey enough opportunities to choose remorse. A life of sins in addition to his lack of thirst for forgiveness is enough to bypass the procedures according to subsection 4E28E6”.*

 

*Judge 2: \*Aggravated sigh\*.*

 

*Judge 1: “Please prepare Corey Hector Terrari for the final testing room, we will be bypassing rooms 4 and 5 for the sake of saving his damned soul”.*

 

 

Oh Good, I’m back I think to myself as I sit upright on the cold dirt ground. The last few death experiences were enough for me. I was ready to finish this so-called judgment process that hot babe in the white robe told me about. I wonder if I was passing. I was never really that hot in school. Well, I was hot yanno, just not the most brains.  Looking around I notice this room doesn’t feel like the others. It is tranquil like. A forest. I can hear animals in the woods. Birds singing. Frogs croaking. “Is this heaven?” I ask aloud.  No one answers.


 Standing up I take in my surroundings. I’m fully dressed in the same clothes the doc cut off of me, but they are back to the way they were before the blue room. It is weird. After each room all my injuries heal and I start fresh in the next room. Almost like a video game restart after the character dies.

 

Dusting off my jeans I stretch and decide it’s best to start making my way to the nearest road. It was the start of night fall and I didn’t want to be in the woods after dark. There was something eerie about the woods after dark yanno, especially for a city lad like me.  After venturing a few yards into the woods, the smell of campfire greeted me like an old memory. It was warm and inviting so I thought it best to head in that direction.  Campfires meant people and people meant my ticket out of here. 



The trouble was, the smell of campfire is coming from every direction. How many damn people were in this forest? I thought to myself. A thick smoke began to cover the ground as I chased down these mystery campfires.  As the smoke grew thicker around my feet the animals in the forest began to panic. Spiders from the forest floor began crawling up my legs to escape the smoke. I tried slapping them off but there were so many. I broke into a run, covering my face with my shirt to limit the smoke entering my lungs. A wall of bright hot fire stopped me in my tracks. I turned to the left and ran a few feet before a burning tree fell across my path. Turning again to the left I saw a herd of wild animals running for their lives through a burning forest. Everything was engulfed in flames. A large bear nearly trampled me as it jumped over the fallen flaming tree.

 

“Holy fuck” I stammered while running in tow of the animals. I was right behind a wild buck when a root caught my foot slamming me to the ground, knocking me unconscious.  Hot, very hot. Fire. My eyes sprung open to find my Levi jeans burning under intense orange flames. I ripped them off and stood up sweating. I was surrounded by red hot flames. There was only one path straight ahead that showed promise of exit. I bolted for it, running faster than I ever have. 


 I didn’t stop running until I ran straight into the side of a vehicle. Disoriented I starred at the vehicle with wide eyes. What the fuck was a vehicle doing in the middle of a forest? The hot metal burned my bare thighs making me yelp, manly like, in pain. I flung myself back landing on my ass. I stare at the car realizing that someone torched it. The low hanging trees nearby most likely caught fire sending the whole forest ablaze. A burning wood sign nearby caught my eye, it read “conservation of Clark”. I’ll tell you I nearly shit myself re-reading that sign. The car was the docs. The fire was set by me. The whole forest was alive with flame because of me. Now I’m trapped in this hell fire. Fucking irony, these judges were damn poetic.

 

One of the tires pops loudly from the heat engulfing the vehicle. It pulls me back to the reality and danger of my current situation. *Escape Corey. Survive damnit.* I push myself to my feet and run. The flames bite at my skin like a pack of wolves starving for their next meal. My silky hair catches fire. I try to pat it out with my bare hands but it only seers my fingers. Another root catches my foot and I fall to the ground. Fire is everywhere. The black smoke fills my lungs and I struggle to breath. I lay in agony surrounded by fire. I stare up at the star filled sky and decide to accept my fate.

 

I lay motionless. Animals and people begin to gather around the circle of flame surrounding me. They just watch me burn. A giant bear, deer, squirrels, wolves, and people of all ages stood around me. I can smell myself cooking, my skin melting, my blood boiling. I thought maybe it was my imagination but as I burned the entities around me began to burn too. They lost their fur, their hair, their flesh turning red as they melted.  They showed no signs of the pain I was experiencing.  They simply watched and burned silently as I squirmed on the forest floor, dying. Why the fuck were they all here?

 

It was only on my last breath that the realization occurred to me. These entities died the night I set that fire. The wildlife, the families, the campers, the hikers, they all died when I set the car ablaze. The empty eyes of my victims starred at me with hatred.

 

You know it was kind of nice having all these people at my funeral. I never would have guessed I’d be cremated alive. Always figured I’d be buried in a hole somewhere when my enemies caught up to me.  I took one long look at the souls I impacted and screamed, a real manly like scream of course. They screamed with me.


 The screams didn’t stop even when I died there on the forest floor. I still hear the screams. I still smell the burning. It never stops. I guess I failed the judging process as I was never healed from the forest room. I spend my days burning, covered in ants who survive off my flesh. Battery acid is periodically poured over my wounds. I live in a freezer for days at a time starred at by the empty eyes of all those I murdered in the forest fire. The doc hangs out sometimes to remind me of his suffering, boring really but at least it’s someone to talk with.

 

The pain is excruciating, but hey regret are for suckers
