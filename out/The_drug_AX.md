Hello, today I will tell the story of when six other people and I agreed to become test subjects for a pharmaceutical company called Oryx.

The company Oryx was looking for volunteers to test a new medication that would help treat depression.

I had lost my son months earlier due to a premature birth. Since then, my life had been turned upside down: my marriage ended, I started using drugs, and I distanced myself from my family and friends. When I felt that I no longer had the strength to go on, I decided to jump off a bridge at around three in the morning, when the streets would be empty.

As I was about to jump, I began to feel like I was being watched. When I looked back, a white van suddenly appeared, parked in the middle of the street. I stared at the van for a few seconds, seeing no sign of movement. When I turned my gaze back toward the edge, I heard footsteps. When I looked back again, there was a tall man wearing a white lab coat.

He approached me and said:
“Hello, my name is John. I couldn’t help but notice what you were about to do, but fortunately, you have found someone who can be your salvation… someone who can be your angel.”

He said all of this while looking at me with an expression of admiration and fascination.

I asked him what he did and how he could help me find the will to live again. He then handed me a card with a phone number and an address

That left me curious, and I decided to give my life one more chance. I went back home and slept. When I woke up, I got ready and went straight to the address I had been given. When I arrived, I was surprised: it was an abandoned nursing home. I hesitated, but since I had nothing left to lose, I went inside.

The place was filthy, there were even bloodstains. I walked through the building and began to suspect that I had been fooled by John, feeling like an idiot. Then I started to hear the sound of a rocking chair moving. Guided by the noise, I entered a room and saw an elderly woman speaking a very strange language. When I said hello, she fell completely silent and pointed to a letter on the table in front of her.

As I approached the table and managed to look at the woman’s face, I noticed that her left eye was completely black. I found it unsettling, and the moment I picked up the paper, she told me to leave in a deep, grave voice.

Terrified, I ran out of that nursing home. When I returned to my car, I opened the card and saw that it contained coordinates and John’s signature. I drove until I reached the location indicated by those coordinates.

They led me to the middle of an abandoned city, full of homeless people and houses falling apart. As I walked down that street, I saw a black car coming toward me. It stopped, and someone instructed me to get into my car and follow it.
We stopped in the desert, where there was a well-structured building, isolated in the middle of nowhere. When I entered, I noticed everything was highly futuristic and top-tier. I reached a room and sat down in a chair beside six other people.
The lights went out, and a video began playing, explaining the drug AX and how it could help treat depression.

 The most important detail was that we had to take the medication once a day, always at 8:00 p.m., with no exceptions: we could not take it earlier, nor up to one hour after 8:00 p.m. They emphasized that we could take the medication home and that they would contact us to carry out supervision.

We all signed the contract, and there was no turning back. We were required to take all ten pills of the medication to complete the agreement. Anyone who violated it would suffer consequences, and if all six violated the contract or died, the remaining person would be freed from it.

The seven of us created a WhatsApp group to communicate. I will name the other six test subjects Luke, Alexandre, Marcos, Maria, Isaac, and Juan.

In the group, I shared how I fell into depression, and I also listened to my colleagues’ stories. Everyone already knew where each other lived. Then we began questioning how the company would know whether we were actually taking the drug. In the end, we all decided to take the medication on that first day.

At 8:00 p.m., I took the pill. About twenty minutes later, I began to feel the effects: my vision blurred and I passed out on the couch. When I woke up, I was completely paralyzed, able to move only my eyes. Suddenly, a creature with one black eye and bluish skin crawled toward me. It opened a letter in front of me, congratulating me on taking the first pill.

After a few minutes, the creature disappeared, and I passed out again. When I woke up, daylight had already broken, and I could move again. At that moment, I felt a level of energy I hadn’t felt in a long time.

I told my colleagues everything that had happened, and all of them reported experiencing the same thing. Maria said she was terrified and that she would not take the pill again. The entire group tried to convince her, but she had already made up her mind.

At 8:00 p.m., I took my second pill. I passed out again, but this time I woke up on the street in front of my house. It was extremely cold and covered in thick fog. The strangest part was that there were dolls on top of every streetlight, all pointing in the direction I should go. When I reached the street they indicated, I saw Maria’s body tied to a cross. As I got closer, she lifted her head, and her left eye was completely black. I panicked. She congratulated me on taking the second pill and said I needed eight more pills—or five fewer lives—to be freed.

She lowered her head, and I passed out again. This time, I woke up in my bed.
The first thing I did was message the group asking about Maria. Everyone did the same—we were worried. Soon after, the news reported that Maria had been found dead, missing one eye. I had a panic attack and felt immense sorrow for her.

The entire group was in shock. Isaac was completely unhinged and said he would take all the pills at once at 8:00 p.m., claiming he didn’t care about the contract.

When 8:00 p.m. arrived, I took my third pill. This time, I passed out in just ten minutes—the fastest it had ever happened. I woke up inside an aquarium. The sky and everything around me was dark blue. As I walked, I saw tanks filled with many different fish, until I came across one containing Isaac’s head. His left eye was black, and his head floated in a river of the AX drug.

 Reflected in the glass of the aquarium, I saw him congratulating me on the third pill and saying there were seven pills left—or four fewer lives.
I woke up in my bedroom to the TV broadcasting the news, reporting Isaac’s death by overdose. The journalists said he was missing his left eye.
At that point, I felt extremely weak. The pill no longer gave me the same energy as before.
I spent the entire day lying down, unable to get up. When 8:00 p.m. arrived, I took another pill. As always, I passed out—but this time I woke up on the floor of my own house. I heard whispers guiding me to the bathroom. When I entered, I saw a pale, child-shaped creature in the mirror. It told me that Alexandre had committed suicide earlier that day. It explained that the company hated suicides and had been created to combat them. It said we would be punished for this tragedy and revealed that the AX drug was extremely powerful, with each dose increasing the chances of becoming fatal. The creature disappeared without congratulating me for the day’s pill.

I woke up on the couch, weaker and in more pain than ever. At that moment, I doubted I would survive five pills, so I tried to last longer than Luke and Marcos.

The group fell completely silent. I eventually started a video call because I wanted to see how the two of them were physically. Marcos looked stronger than me, while Luke seemed worse but could still stand. I asked how many pills they had managed to take. Marcos said he could endure all five. That’s when I realized I was doomed, and by Luke’s expression, he thought the same.
This time, we agreed to take the pill together during a video call and waited until 8:00 p.m.
When the time came, we took the pill and passed out. When I woke up, it was already daytime. I found it strange that nothing had happened, but my phone—which had been with me—was gone. When I went to the living room, I found my phone next to a gun and a note congratulating me on another pill, saying I would know what to do.
At no point did killing anyone cross my mind. Instead, I barricaded myself, placing the couch against the door and shutting the windows. I feared Marcos, as he had more strength and could easily kill me. Because of that, I started another video call to see where they were.
Marcos answered, but Luke didn’t. Marcos spoke strangely and never mentioned a gun. In the middle of our conversation, someone shot Marcos in the head—the shot seemed to come from the window.

I immediately realized I was in danger and knew Luke would come to my house.
At 7:00 p.m., someone knocked on my door. I stayed silent. Luke said he urgently needed me. I remained quiet. As time passed, he became more desperate, pounding harder on the door, begging for help. His fear was real—he didn’t know if he could survive another pill. I didn’t open the door. I just sat there, waiting for 8:00 p.m.

When the time came, I took the pill and woke up at the same place where I had planned to kill myself. This time, I heard applause. It was John, saying that Luke had overdosed after taking the pill and that I had won for being the only survivor.
He told me my prize was the end of my depression. When he placed his hand on my shoulder, I felt a vibration and woke up sitting in a hospital chair. I was confused until smiling nurses came to call me in, telling me my son had been born. I was shocked and overwhelmed with emotion—my son was alive, and my wife had come back to me.

When I got home, I saw the remaining pills and a note congratulating me on my victory, saying I was free from the contract and could do whatever I wanted with the remaining pills. I did the obvious thing and threw them in the trash.
And I used this second chance to live in the best way possible—without giving up.
