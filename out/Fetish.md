***\[Transcript Begins\]***

**Angelo:** What the hell is this, River…?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Just getting everything on the record, Bill

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** What the hell is that supposed to mean? You think *I* did this shit?!

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** That’s not what I’m saying. Just… sit your ass down, Bill. Go on. Ass in the seat. Let’s go through what happened?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** You already know what happened. I already filed my reports.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yeah, well this is for someone else.

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Someone else… what, that specialty unit you mentioned?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yeah.

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** *\[Sigh\]* I dunno what the fuck you think you’re gonna hear from me here that isn’t in the report.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Look, this is just how they do things. They want these for their own records, okay? So can you take the bug out of your ass and play ball for like fifteen goddamn minutes?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Sure… sure…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Great. So, why don’t we get right into it, okay? The case you were investigating. I want you to walk me through that.

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Right. The double homicide. Leon and Mary Gibson. Married couple. A neighbor had called us in after noticing a strange smell coming from the house. A couple of officers had shown up on the scene and found the door unlocked. Upon stepping inside, they also noticed the smell and discovered two bodies in the bedroom. One male, caucasian, brown hair, and one female, caucasian and blonde. They were identified as the homeowners.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** What had happened to them?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Leon Gibson was found in an armchair, he had been tied up using fetish gear, although it had been tied so tight that it had cut off circulation in his limbs. The… um… gimp mask… he’d been wearing had also been pulled so tight around his face that it had asphyxiated him. And Mary Gibson was… *\[Pause\]* She was found on the bed, mostly undressed. She had been hooked up to some sort of… electrostimulation device… which an autopsy later determined had delivered a lethal dose of electricity. She was… shit… how do I say this… the fucking thing had basically cooked the poor woman from the inside out.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Jesus Christ…

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Yeah. Yeah, that’s what I said. And that’s not even getting to the worst part.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** The worst part?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Something had been getting at the bodies… eating them. Anyway, my partner, James Horvath and I got called in to take a look over the scene. At a glance we figured it was just a date night gone wrong. Horvath suggested that maybe Mr. Gibson got his jollies by watching her shock herself, or something like that. Lord knows… Horvath probably knew more about that shit than I do. Anyway, he suggested that maybe she went too far, he couldn’t get up to help her and they’d both died like that. Then maybe some sort of animal had gotten in and started gnawing at them. He said he’d heard of similar cases before. People who got off on weird shit going too far and getting themselves killed. Autoerotic asphyxiation or shit like that. Like I said… he’d know. But no… none of that added up. They didn’t have any pets, and the bite marks on their bodies weren’t consistent with any known animal. Plus - the toy Mary Gibson had been using shouldn’t have been able to deliver a lethal voltage of electricity. I mean, it was battery operated. It shouldn’t have been able to do that much damage. And Leon Gibsons fetish gear shouldn’t have been able to restrain or asphyxiate him the way it did. I mean… fuck, they had to cut the goddamn mask off of him in the coroners office. There’s no way he got it on that tight by himself. None of that tracked.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I see. So you figured there was more at play here?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** It was obvious there was. Anyways, looking around the room, Horvath noticed that they’d set up a hidden camera on a bookshelf. We took a look at that, and at their personal computer hoping it might fill in some of the blanks. Turns out, Mr. and Mrs. Gibson liked to film their… um… sexytimes. And they liked to keep the marital bed open, as it were.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I see…

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Yeah… not my thing, but to each their own, I guess? Most of the videos we saw were… well, reasonably harmless. They’d bring another man in, Mr. Gibson would be tied to a chair, watching his wife get busy with some other guy. His wife had a thing for… um… electrostimulation… that all tracked. And as far as we could tell, the guys in the video were *aware* it was all being filmed. They were looking into the camera and everything. Weird, but more or less above board.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** What about the video of the… incident…?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** The file was corrupted. There *was* a file, we just couldn’t play it back. Still, the fact that there even was a file suggested that someone else had been at the scene. These two sometimes filmed themselves… um… alone. But the setup more closely resembled the one they went for when there was a third party present. Horvath and I considered it likely that said third party had been involved in their deaths. So we started looking for anything else we could find. Any evidence that there was someone else at the scene.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** What did you find?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Well, the neighbors had one of those porch cameras. The kind that starts recording every time there’s movement outside. Once we had the approximate time of death from the coroner, we checked in with them to see what footage their camera had gotten from that day. We didn’t find much. There weren’t any other cars out front that day… but we did see a taxi dropping someone off, and another taxi picking them up roughly an hour later.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** You get a look at the suspect?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** No. Funny thing… the video got a bit distorted during the dropoff and pickup. We only barely recognized it was a taxi that was out front. But it was enough for us to get a lead.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Fair enough. You called the taxi company?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Obviously. Asked them to look through their records and we got the names of the drivers who’d done the drop off and pick up. Horvath and i brought them in for a chat. I’m pretty sure the recordings of those interviews are kicking around somewhere.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I think I’ve seen them… but let’s hear it in your own words. What did they say?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Not much. The drop off driver said he’d brought a man to that address and described him as being in his mid thirties, dressed casually and attractive. He’d described the man as talkative, friendly and he provided enough details for a sketch artist but…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** But…?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Well… the second driver described something completely different. See, the pickup driver described a *woman* entering his vehicle. Blonde, college aged, glasses. Said she’d been a flirt although he hadn’t really engaged with her.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I see… so, two different unrelated pickups?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** I don’t think so… both drivers gave the same address as a pick up and drop off location. The address the first driver picked up the first passenger at was the same address that the second driver dropped them off at. Aside from the changing passengers, it was basically a round trip. Plus - both drivers insisted that the person they’d picked up and dropped off had gone into and come out of the Gibsons house. They saw them go into and come out of the front door. The neighbors didn’t recognize either of the sketches we got off of the drivers either.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** So… you think it was the same person?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** I didn’t know what to think at the time, and I still don’t know what to think now, River…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Right… fair enough.

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** *\[Sigh\]* I need a goddamn cigarette… do you mind?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Not at all.

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Thanks.

&#x200B;

*\[There is a period of no dialogue, where Angelo can be heard lighting and taking several drags of a cigarette.\]*

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** So… the address the other taxi’s said they’d been to, I assume that’s where you and Horvath went next?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Yeah. It was a house, supposedly owned by a gentleman by the name of Hank Patch. We wanted to bring Patch in for questioning… as you can probably tell, that didn’t happen.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** What did happen?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Well when Horvath and I got there, nobody answered the door. Actually, there weren’t any signs that anyone was home at all. Horvath wanted to try to go in anyway. Said we were in ‘*hot pursuit*.’ Fucking jackass… obviously we didn’t do that. I made us wait. Made us keep an eye on the house to see who was coming and going.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** And what did you see?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Not much. We saw movement inside though, through the windows. Horvath went back to knock on the door. Took the occupant a while to actually answer this time, although they *did* eventually answer, only it sure as hell wasn’t Hank Patch who answered that door.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Who was it?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** A woman. Not the same woman the drivers described either. This one was tall, sort of lanky, middle aged and had long black hair. She had very sharp, pointed features and was dressed in leather. Not like… fetish gear, but like… fuck, it might as well have been. 6 inch high heels, tight leather pants, a leather crop top with a goddamn boob window, and this cut off leather jacket.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Did she give a name?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** She called herself ‘*Sandra*’.She said she was a tenant. She was… I dunno. Hard to describe. Odd. The way she spoke was odd, the way she carried herself was odd. Horvath didn’t seem to notice it, but I did. Honestly, his eyes were just glued to her fucking ass most of the time. Don’t get me wrong, it was a fantastic ass. But… I dunno, something about her seemed to throw him off guard. Anyway - aside from that and the way she was dressed, she was downright pleasant for the most part. She apologized for making us wait, made some excuse for why she hadn’t answered the door before, then started answering our questions. She said that Patch was her landlord, and that she’d be willing to put us in touch with him. She looked at the sketches we’d gotten off the drivers and told us she didn’t recognize either of them.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** So she was being cooperative?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** One hundred percent.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** What changed?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Honestly… I’m not entirely sure. She asked us if we wanted a drink. Y’know, basic fucking hospitality. Horvath said yes, so she got up and went into the kitchen. While Horvath and I were sitting there, waiting on her to come back, I took a look at my notes, and I saw him glancing in one of the mirrors. That mirror faced into the kitchen… I figured he was still peeping on her, trying to check her out. Not very professional, but whatever… you know what Horvath was like. Good cop, but he had a bad habit of letting his little head do the thinking.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yeah…

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Anyway, he’s watching her in the mirror and suddenly he gets this look on his face. He goes pale… like he’s seen a fucking ghost. I don’t know what exactly it is that he saw… and I don’t think I want to know. One minute he’s sitting there, and the next he’s screaming and going for his gun.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** So he attacked her unpromoted?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Yes… I tried… I tried to get him to calm down, but he was screaming. I could barely make out what he was saying, but when that woman, Sandra came back in, he kept on yelling shit like: *“What the fuck is that thing? What the fuck is that thing?!”* I tried to stop him from firing his weapon but…

&#x200B;

*\[Pause\]*

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Angelo?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** He shot her in the head, River… he shot her in the fucking head… and she just stood there, completely unphased. Worse still.. I saw the bullet wound but… it didn’t look *right.* It didn’t bleed… she barely even reacted. She just… she just fucking smiled and started walking toward us. Horvath just started to panic. He pushed me off, and kept shooting at her. Nothing changed. She just kept getting closer to him… shrugged off the bullets like they were gnats. He… he emptied his entire fucking clip into her. And she just took it… she just… took it.

&#x200B;

*\[Angelo can be heard lighting another cigarette.\]*

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** What happened to Detective Horvath, Angelo?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** She grabbed him. Grabbed him, tossed him to the ground and… she looked at me. She had this smile… this… knowing smile. Then she pressed her high heel down on his head. Horvath was struggling but she kept him pinned. She stepped on his head and just… *\[Pause\]* Fuck… you saw the body, didn’t you?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I did…

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Then you know.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** She did *that* just by stepping on his head…?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** *I watched it.* His skull just… just cracked. I could see the look in his eyes and I knew he felt it. I knew he could feel her crushing his skull… I could see the heel of her shoe piercing his head… I could hear him screaming, I could hear his bones cracking… I… Jesus Christ… I can’t fucking unsee it… his fucking eye… it popped… fuck… fuck…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** What did you do next, Angelo?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** I went for my own gun… knew it wouldn’t do any good, but I went for it and started stumbling back through the house, trying to get to the door. She just… *\[Pause\]* she finished up with Horvath. Then looked at me… and when she did I… I could see a change. She looked different… she looked like… Jesus Christ…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** What did she look like, Angelo?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** I don’t… I don’t want to say it…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Angelo, I need this on the record.

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Not this… *not this.*

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Angelo… for the record, please.

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** *\[Sigh\]* I’m gonna sound like a goddamn nutjob…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I promise you, I’m not going to judge what you saw.

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Yeah… sure… whatever… *\[Pause\]* She… she wasn’t a she anymore… her body changed. Became a mans body. A young mans. Shirtless… dressed only in tight leather shorts… and… fuck me… and a fucking dog mask.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I’m sorry… a dog mask…?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Like… like a leather dog mask… don’t make me go into the fucking specifics, River.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Right… um… I have to ask, was this mask… familiar?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** *\[Pause\]* You don’t have to ask that, do you? But fine… yes. There’s a… a guy I’m seeing. It… that thing in the house it… it resembled him. Look, what I do in my private life is my own goddamn business! I wasn’t fucking broadcasting it like Horvath was!

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Staying on topic… the woman in the house, Sandra… she… transformed into your partner…?

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Yes… and as she… as *it* got closer to me, it got down on all fours. Snarling like a real dog… growling at me. Getting closer… *\[Pause\]* That’s the point where I just started running. Didn’t stop until I was back out on the street and in the car. I called for backup. I just said that there was an officer down. I didn’t… I didn’t say anything else. Not even in my statement. You know the rest, don’t you? Or do you need me to say that for the record too?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I do… but if you’d rather just end here…

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** I would.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Okay. Then for the record, I’ll state that the officers who arrived on the scene only found the body of Detective Horvath. The… suspect was not present.

&#x200B;

**Angelo:** Are we done here?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yes.

**Angelo:** Good.

&#x200B;

*\[Movement can be heard as Detective Angelo leaves his seat.\]*

&#x200B;

***\[Transcript Ends\]***

&#x200B;

***Notes:*** *Detective Angelo’s statement, unusual as it may be, unfortunately fits in all too well with some other reports I’ve seen lately. Aside from the recent murders of Gareth Lovina and Sebastian Johnson, I’ve also seen similar reports of people killed in what I can only describe as fetishistic manners. Of these reports, Detective Angelo is the only one who seems to have gotten a look at the assailant… although his description creates more questions than it answers.*

&#x200B;

*Whatever this thing is, I can’t tell if it’s tormenting its victims with their own fantasies or something else. Either way, the attacks have remained steady… something needs to be done.*

*I spoke with a few other officers who were on the scene as follow up. The body of Hank Patch was discovered, partially eaten in the basement of the house. The coroner is still looking into the cause of death but so far, his theory is excessive blunt force to his rear end… he was literally spanked to death. The officers on scene found very little about this ‘Sandra’ woman, although they noted that a model matching her description was seen in a pornographic magazine that Mr. Patch owned. I think that’s where the trail of ‘Sandra’ ends.*

&#x200B;

*As has become the routine with these kinds of cases - I’ve passed everything along to Justice and her people. God willing they’ll sort this shit out, although given how long this has been going on, I’m wondering if they’re having as much trouble with this case as I am. I suppose time will tell. Until then, I’ll keep my eyes open… and maybe stop dating until this is over.*
