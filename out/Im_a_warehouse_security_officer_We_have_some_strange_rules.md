I have worked as a security officer for the better half of 3 years at this little meat packing warehouse outside of town. And I must say in those 3 years I have seen some pretty crazy stuff. 

just a little background before I start - my name is Matt, and I'm 25 years old. I must say at 25 there are better jobs than this one but there is a pretty good reason why I ended up here, and why I didn't leave even after I realized just how messed up this place can be. 

That being not many employers will hire someone for security without a valid driver's license. This being that many security officers are required to drive around the grounds and keep an eye on things. Not this job though you see this job just came with some rules, some pretty crazy rules. 

And if you had to see what I see every day you would understand what I mean. 

But I do not think many of you really care about all that, do you? You're here for the story, so here we go. 

The rules of Warehouse 11.

**Rule 1**. When clocking on for your shift always make sure the time clock reads the proper date and time. If the time clock for whatever reason reads yesterday's date and time or any other time not belonging to that date, then you must leave the office immediately wait 5 minutes and go back inside. 

Sounds simple enough right? This rule, and the time I almost broke it, were the first signs I got that this warehouse may not be 100% normal. 

It was a cold day for early march and as usual the time came where I had to clock in for my shift. Not going to lie here I was dreading this as when I had gotten home the morning prior I barely slept and by this point, I was extremely tired. Be that as it may however the warehouse needed a security guard, and I was that guy who had to do it. 

My friend had dropped me off at warehouse 11 at exactly 6:55 pm 5 minutes before my scheduled shift, yawning I thanked him stepped out of the car and miserably walked into the office where the time clock awaited me. I took one look at the time clock and went to swipe my credentials card when I realized oh shit the time and date were from 3 months ago. 

I turned to leave the room remembering what rule 1 had said when a voice came from the other side of the room. Oh, it's ok man swipe your card the clock was unplugged so it reads the wrong date and time you should be fine. It was my boss, but how? I had just seen him in the loading bay before I walked in here. 

**Rule 2**. If you ever see a person resembling your supervisor telling you to break a rule or ignore it, simply do not make eye contact and just walk away and avoid that area for the rest of your shift they will not follow you. 

So that is just what I did upon doing this however I completely forgot to return and officially clock in. So, I guess you can say rule 2 saved me in a way. Luckily the rest of the shift went smoothly, and I was able to get my clock in fixed the next shift. 

**Rule 3**. If a truck arrives at loading bay 2 after the last 11 pm truck delivery, simply close the bay door and alert your supervisor.  

About 6 months ago I was responding to a security call of a fight between the sales supervisor and an employee that started over the employee not getting their proper sick time. And when I was about to tell the employee to just leave, I heard the sound of a truck backing up to what seemed to be bay 2. 

I took a look down at my watch realizing it was 11:45 pm and there was no way there should be a truck right now. And then it hit me like a bag of rocks I remembered Rule 3. If a truck arrives at loading bay 2 after the last 11 pm truck delivery, simply close the bay door and alert your supervisor.  Remembering this I ran over to the bay slamming the door shut and simultaneously storming into the security supervisor's office. 

Rule 3 I yelled seemingly out of breath. His face went pale, and I watched as he jumped from his seat barely touching the office door before emerging on to the warehouse floor. Yelling could be heard between him and a dark hooded figured who had seemed to have stepped out of the mysterious truck at bay 2. 

He returned looking more pale than how he did a moment ago just staring at me he muttered return to work now. I looked at him for a second then at the now abandoned bay. What happened I blurted out I said back to work now!!! I turned and left for the door the rest of the shift went as smoothly as one could hope it to go after an incident like that.

**Rule 5**. If you hear static on your radio anytime between the hours of 2 am and 4 am smash it as fast as you can and grab a new one from the supply office.

So, for whatever odd reason there is no rule 4 and to be honest this could be because rule 5 covers 2 rules in one because of its danger to everyone involved. It was about a year ago now when I experienced this it was like any other night, you had the few actional things happen from rule 1 and 3 which at this point I was quite used to. 

The night was winding down when out of the blue my radio came to life static filled the office like a tv with a bad connection. I shot a look at the time 3:25 am oh shit I muttered out, taking off my equipment I quickly smashed it on the desk in front of me until it broke into tiny little pieces all over. 

I knew by now that these rules were not just for kicks that they actually meant life or death in some instances. Like the one that happened a week prior to this when a new hire ignored this rule and simply just disappeared. 

I shook the thought out of my head as I walked down the hall to the supply office grabbing a new radio and putting it on. Just as I was about to turn and head back to my desk it happened Rule 2. If you ever see a person resembling your supervisor telling you to break a rule or ignore it, simply do not make eye contact and just walk away and avoid that area for the rest of your shift they will not follow you. 

There in the doorway of the supply office stood my security supervisor. Hey Matt, why did you go and break your radio they only wanted to talk to you put that back and go listen to the person on the other side I promise it will be worth it. I shook my head passing him almost shoving him down. looking behind me every so often to make sure he wasn't really following me, and he wasn't. I practically jogged back to my office where I slammed the door locking it behind me. 

**Rule 6**. If the buzzer at the front gate goes off at any time after 1 am do not answer just ignore it and the thing at the gate will go away. 

Yesterday halfway through my shift I was just about to do my rounds when the buzz from the front gate buzzer filled the tiny office that I sat in. I nearly jumped out of my skin when out of curiosity I looked up at the monitor and saw who or maybe what I should say was standing at the gate. 

Through tired glassy eyes and fogged up camera lens's I could make out the distinct image of a 9-foot man standing at that front gate just smiling at the camera. I continued to stare in udder shock as he rang the bell again and again and again until the buzzer would not ring anymore. 

I looked back up at the monitor to see if the man or thing was gone and it was. Breathing a sigh of relief, I got up and made my rounds which ultimately turned out uneventful. 

**Rule 7.** Do not talk to the janitor we do not have one. 

Out of the 3 years I have worked here I thought I had seen it all that was until 2 weeks ago when I got to experience rule 7 our final rule. It was about 5 am and to be honest at this point in my shift I was ready to go home. With already having the first 3 rules happen to me I was tired and beat. So, when I saw him you can only imagine my pain. 

There less than 10 feet away stood an elderly man mopping the break room floor. I stood to my feet knowing we never had a janitor, and I was pretty confident they haven't hired one recently either. Then I remembered Rule 7. Do not talk to the janitor we do not have one. 

Remembering this I quickly sat back down in my chair praying he did not see me but of course he had seen me, and he was now standing in the doorway of my office just staring. Nice evening, we seem to be having aye he muttered to me in a calm tone. 

I continued to ignore him remembering the rule although this just seemed to anger him as he got louder with his tone this time now being more aggressive than passive with his words towards me. Talk to me he would yell you know its rude not to talk to someone who is holding a conversation with you right he would say. 

I just continued to ignore him almost giving in on more than one occurrence. He then left as quickly as he came, and the building returned to a calmer atmosphere.
