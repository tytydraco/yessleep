I was sitting in my room one day minding my own business just playing on my PlayStation and all of a sudden my mom barged into my room. We are going on vacation she announced but you’re not going because you’re grounded because of your recent exam scores so I got really upset because I couldn’t go on vacation. I asked them where they were going and she said they were going to France somewhere. I’ve been wanting to go since I was little. 

it’s been weeks and they’re still gone. It’s getting kind of lonely here and I’m running low on food but every time I turn my back I have a weird feeling that something.  someone is behind me lurking around I keep on brushing off the feeling telling myself that I’m paranoid. I hope they come back soon. I really miss them. so I just swept it off for the past few days they’ve been gone it’s been routine sleep clean find something to eat clean it up and sleep some more it’s all I’ve been doing for the past couple weeks and then my dad came over yesterday asking me to babysit my brother, so I said sure.

it was going good you know I actually had someone around me for once with these past couple weeks and it felt nice because of the comfort of someone else in my own home just us two together, or so i thought. my baby brother has been sleeping on the couch right next to my bedroom and I’ve been sleeping in my room one morning. I woke up and I felt wide awake so I went out of my room to go get a glass of water as I open my door. I looked to my left, because I felt weird as soon as I walked out of my room and the closet door was off the hinges and floating in the air. It scared me. I ran back to my room screaming I forgot about my baby brother.

minutes went by without a sound and then I heard my baby brother outside my room cooing and laughing and so I thought oh he’s awake so got up to go get him, my door was locked. a couple seconds later I see my baby brother walking up to my door. he can’t walk I thought to myself and so I looked underneath the door some more and I saw some dirty bare feet with a chain hooked onto its ankle, and the chain was going into the closet. I got even more scared and then all of a sudden I hear the closet door slam shut. I went to my door again to try and open it, and to my surprise it opened, but I saw the most terrifying thing ever my baby brother hanging there from a rope dead. 

I froze in my tracks. I didn’t know what to do so I sat there, and I cried and cried. I grabbed him from the rope and it was too late. I held him in my arms and I sat there, crying even more and then all of a sudden I felt a sharp deep pain in my back.
