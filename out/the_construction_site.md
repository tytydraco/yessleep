Last summer, my family and I went on a road trip around Sweden. We had stayed at my grandmother and grandfather's summer cottage. It is a small cabin in southern Sweden, quite remote.
 

One day my father and I were going for a walk with our dog. We walked for a while, took pictures, laughed and had fun. And then we came to a barrier, there was a sign that said something like "trespassers will be shot, survivors will be shot again" We thought about turning around, but we went over it anyway, and thought nothing more of it. 


When we were well inside, we came to a clearly abandoned type of construction site, there were lots of machines and stuff, like those stone crusher machines. We walked around and thought about what it was to get something. We went a little further in and came to a small meadow.


I suddenly felt the need to pee, so I went into the woods and was going to investigate my needs. When I finished I heard something rustling in a bush a little further away. I thought it was a bird so I moved on. When we started walking in the meadow, our dog started barking like crazy. He pulled, whined and barked. We thought it was some rabbit or something.


We crossed the meadow and came to a road. We walked on it for a while and then I saw something red and black on the ground. We went closer and saw that it was a dismembered snake. We PANICED, and ran away.


When we got our lungs out, we went a little further, and we saw more machines, really rusty and old. But I noticed that it was a machine with new and fresh tires, and next to it was a completely random yellow helmet, with blood stains on it. 


I went to Maps on my mobile, I zoomed out and saw a small cabin not too far away, next to the cabin there was "HELP ME SOS" with bloody toilet paper. We were so scared. We moved on.


When we would go out of it, the place is disturbed. We heard lots of lots of strange noises. It sounded like a distant scream, coughing and crazy laughter, the sounds came from the direction the cabin was facing.


Then we saw two shady things. The first thing was that there was something big, white on a hill. It had what sim looked like two big eyes and like two horns. It also looked like a dinosaur skeleton. The other thing was something white hanging from a tree, it looked like a white nightie.


Now we were scared. We started walking back and the sign from earlier had changed, now it read "GO AWAY". Then we heard a rustling in the nearby bush. We heard someone whisper "Oh shit". Well, we ran from there as fast as we could. We will never ever go your again. Be careful when you walk in the forest.
