  


‘I’m an idiot,’ I thought as I walked down the dark street carrying a backpack full of stuff I wasn’t even sure I needed.   
But who knew what I’d need when I was going back to a haunted museum to sacrifice myself… I mean, guard the place for the night.   
I went home and did a lot of soul searching about staying on as the night watchman. (Translation, I watched some Ben Stiller movies about museums, then fell asleep listening to this story on youtube about a park ranger who turned into a cryptid hunter.)   
After paying my bills, I had money left over so I went shopping for some things that might help me live through the night... I mean do my guard job a little better, yeah that’s it. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a magical store like that cryptid hunter did. When I asked the lady at my local Dollar General if they carried Tranquilizer guns, she looked at me like I’d grown a third head.   
I decided to improvise. I bought a nerf gun and several bottles of hot sauce (extra spicy), then got a few more flashlights (plus batteries), and duct tape (because you can always use duct tape). I grabbed a few more things that caught my eye (I have no earthly idea why) and the biggest backpack they had, along with a heavy jacket, some extra clothes, and lots of bandages (because my back wasn’t healed yet and I wanted to be safe rather than sorry).  
As I walked down the street in my heavy-duty clothes with a thick jacket, a full backpack strapped to my back, more than one car slowed down as the people stared at me.   
Unfortunately, one of those cars happened to belong to the local sheriff.  
“Evening,” he said as he pulled up beside me and matched my pace.  
“Evening, sir,” I said feeling the same feeling everyone does when a cop pulls up behind them. (What did I do, what have I ever done in my entire life? He knows everything and he’s coming to take me to jail for that thing I did a long time ago.)  
“You feelin’ a little cold tonight?” he said looking at my jacket.  
“Just heading to work,” I said starting to sweat.  
“Where do you work at?”  
“The museum,” I said pointing towards the lights that had just appeared on the horizon.  
He stopped the car, got out and walked up in front of me. It was a bit intimidating since he had a few inches and a good fifty pounds on me.   
As he walked up, I saw all the stuff on his belt and was half tempted to ask if I could borrow his taser for the night. He saw me eyeing his belt and stood a few feet back. I guess he thought I was gonna make a grab for his gun.  
“When did you start working there?” he said.  
“Last night.”  
He looked me up and down.  
“You seem to be remarkably in one piece.”  
“My back hurts a bit.”  
He nodded with what I would almost call respect with maybe a little awe.  
“So you know a little bit about the place?” I said lowering my voice and looking around to see if anyone else was listening.  
He responded by rolling up his sleeve. There was a nasty scar on the back of his forearm that looked something had bitten a chunk out of it. But the bite was huge, much larger than any human mouth.  
“Wow,” I said, “Did you get that at… ?”  
He nodded.   
“In the basement,” he said. “I quit after the second night and a week in the hospital.”  
I swallowed hard.  
“A week?”  
He nodded as he took a step closer and reached into his belt. I thought he was getting cuffs to arrest me for something when he pulled out a can of pepper spray and handed it to me.  
I looked at it for a long moment.  
“Go ahead, take it,” he said. “You’ll need it.”  
I took the can and stashed it in my backpack.  
“Thanks.”   
He nodded then walked back around and got in his car.   
“Tell the curator Ted sends his regards,” he said as he got in the car.   
I stepped over and leaned in the window.  
“Any advice for dealing with the basement?” I said.  
He thought for a long moment.  
“When you get stuck, just remember ‘up is down’.”  
“Ok,” said, hoping for something a little less cryptic.  
“And if you do make it through the night in one piece, come see me at the station,” he said. “Anyone who can make it two nights in that place I’d consider hiring as a deputy.”  
I nodded and he nodded back, then drove away.  
In a way it was nice to know someone else had done this job and made it out alive. Of course, that someone being the sheriff was a nice bonus. At least I knew I wasn’t crazy.    
The rest of the walk I had a little bounce in my step. Instead of trudging to my doom, I started thinking I can do this.   
When I stood at the bottom of the steps once more, it didn’t seem nearly as scary as last night. (Wow, I can’t believe it’s only been one night since I was here.)  
I nodded to the gargoyles for some odd reason, then climbed the stairs and opened the door.  
I was a few minutes early, so I went over and sat my backpack beside the desk and went to the bathroom. When I came back out, the curator was standing near the desk, smiling.  
“I’m so glad you chose to return,” he said. “And looking somewhat more prepared.”  
“I hope so,” I said. “Will I have to do a round upstairs and in the basement?”  
“No, I believe the basement will take up much of your time this evening.”  
As relieved as I was not to have to do both, his statement worried me a bit.  
“Oh, I almost forgot, Ted sends his regards,” I said.  
He smile grew broader.  
“Ah, so you’ve spoken to the sheriff?”  
“Only in passing. He wanted to know what I was doing with the backpack.”  
He glanced down at the pack with what I would almost call an amused look.  
“I’m sure he was professionally curious,” he said. “If you see the sheriff again, tell him he’s more than welcome to return for a visit. During daytime hours, of course.”  
“I’ll let him know.”  
“Well, then, I’ll let you get to it, unless you have any questions.”  
“Only one,” I said. “What would happen if I talked to the apparition in this room?”  
His smile faltered.  
“I wouldn’t,” he said. “Not even I talk to him.”  
He nodded and glided away, leaving me alone. But I wondered if I was ever really alone here. With so much supernatural happening in this place, I wondered how many entities watched, invisible to the human eye.  
I shook off the thought and focused on getting ready, There was another paper on the desk, but it was blank.  
“What, no stupid rules tonight?” I said.  
‘My rules aren’t stupid.’   
Appeared on the paper.  
“Really? ‘There are no rules, there are no rules?’”  
‘That was to give you the hidden message,’ appeared on the paper. ‘I couldn’t come right out and say it, where’s the challenge in that?’  
“Maybe I should challenge you with a paper shredder.”  
‘That’s it, no help for you tonight. No rules, no hints, no nothing.’  
I paused to reflect on the fact that I was having an argument with a piece of paper. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the strangest thing I’d done in the last twenty-four hours.  
As I glanced down at the paper, I felt the room grow cold. Instantly, I froze in place and looked at the floor.  
The apparition came right up to me, I could feel it, the warmth, the stench of death. I refused to move, however I did keep my eyes open. I saw a pair of human looking feet, but they were rotting, decaying flesh barely held on to the bones as they hovered right in front of me.  
Even though I knew what to do, my mind was going spastic telling me to run, to get away from this thing at all costs. My reaction was to stay as still as possible. It sniffed me, then turned and drifted away. Once the temperature in the room went back to normal, I looked up and it was gone.  
Wiping the sweat off my forehead, I glanced back at the paper.  
‘See, you wouldn’t have known to do that if it wasn’t for me.’  
“You’re right,” I said. “I apologize. Would you please help me this evening.”  
There was a long pause before a single word appeared.  
‘No.’  
I reached into my pocket and pulled out a disposable lighter.  
‘What do you think you’re doing?’  
I flicked the wheel and the flame sprang to life.  
‘This isn’t funny.’  
I held the paper a few inches above the flame and waited.  
‘You think you can threaten me?’  
I lowered the paper a little closer to the flame.  
‘Burn in hell.’  
“You first,” I said, lowering the paper a little closer so that the smoke from the flame licked it hungrily.  
‘Alright! Alright! I’ll do it!’  
I released the button and the flame disappeared.  
A map appeared on the paper, or at least a partial map. It showed the way to a stairwell and at the bottom a corridor, then it faded to nothing.  
“What good is this if I can’t see what’s down there?”  
‘I guess you’ll have to find out for yourself.’  
I relit the lighter.  
‘Sorry, I’m not allowed to show any more.’  
“Alright, then how about some rules?”  
‘rule number one: don’t get killed.’  
“Very funny.”  
‘I’ll give you a little more.’  
A red dot showed up on the map in the far corner off to the left, but no rooms were visible so I had no idea where it actually was.  
“What’s that?”  
‘You’ll want to stay away from that.’  
“Why?”  
But no more words came, no more bits or pieces of the map.  
“Fine,” I said tossing the paper on the desk, taking a picture of it with my phone, then picking up my pack. “I’ll make it without you.”  
Then I started off toward the stairs. They were not well marked. I got to the end of the hallway and there were three doors staring back at me. I looked at the picture of the map that showed the right door was the one to the stairwell. It didn’t show what was behind the other doors. Even though my curiosity was piqued, I didn’t dare open a door I wasn’t supposed to. Making it through the night would be hard enough without adding extra complications.  
I opened the stairwell door and stared into total darkness. I’d learned my lesson from last night. Reaching into my pack, I pulled out a light on a  headband, and turned it on, then grabbed one of the regular flashlights and ignited it.   
The stairway was made of wood that creaked with every step I took.  
“Did I really expect any less,” I said to no one.  
I made sure to check at each turn that nothing was waiting to jump out at me. Three turns later, I arrived at the bottom. The floor looked old but non-descript. It could’ve been concrete, but it was so dusty I couldn’t tell for sure.  
In front of me stretched a hallway with stone walls on each side. There were no doors, no windows, no decorations of any kind. As ornate as the main hall was, this was the opposite, nothing special about it.   
Slowly I made my way to the end, checking behind me as I went. When I reached the end of the hall, there was a t-junction. I could turn left or right.   
Peeking around the corner and looking each way, they both seemed identical. Glancing at the map on my phone, I saw the red dot way off in the corner to the left.   
I turned right, trying to keep as much distance between me and whatever that dot represented.  
This hallway looked exactly like the last one, but there was something different. It wasn’t a chill in the air, more like a heaviness. I slowed and flashed my lights all around looking for anything that might be getting ready to attack me.  
With each step the air grew stale. The heaviness made it hard to breathe. I felt like I was being pulled down into the floor. Looking down, I gasped. My feet were gone. I pulled on my leg with both hands, struggling against the force pulling me under. After much effort my right foot reappeared out of the floor. I did the same on the other side and my left foot reappeared.   
I quickly backed away before I could get sucked in again. The floor appeared to be no different, but this strange paranormal quicksand made me turn and go back the other way. Hopefully, I still had room to avoid the red dot.  
As I walked, the heaviness didn’t go away. It’s as though I’d brought something back with me, weighing me down.  
I passed the hallway to the stairs on my way to the other side. The end of this hallway opened up to a large room.   
Looking around I saw dents along the wall. The room was sparsely decorated. There were lit torches on the bare stone wall every ten feet or so. In the far corner, something caught my eye. I stepped up to it, checking all around first, and finding a full length mirror.   
Staring into it, I saw why the sheriff stopped me. I looked like a combination of petty thief and Unabomber. Taking the opportunity, I straightened my hair in the mirror. As I stared into it, a face appeared behind me. I whipped around but no one was there.  
Puzzled, I scanned the room for the interloper, when strong hands grabbed me and pulled me inside the mirror.  
I flailed my arms around trying to grab my captor and regain my balance at the same time, but it was futile. I was falling backwards, just like in my nightmares, and there was nothing I could do but fall.  
After what seemed like forever, I landed on my back on a hard floor, knocking the wind out of me. While I struggled for my breath to return, I looked around the room. It had stone walls, but the floor was ornate, like the floor of the main hall.   
Red eyes glared back at me from the corner and slowly approached. As it came closer to my light, I recoiled. It looked like the biggest dog I’d ever seen only it had no fur, it was like someone had skinned it alive then left it go to terrorize unwitting visitors.  
Drool slid around sharp looking massive fangs and dripped to the floor, leaving a trail leading right up to me.   
I was helpless. Try as I might, I couldn’t catch my breath. My hand unzipped the bag and reached inside. It found a round canister I was looking for and I whipped it out, ready to attack, only to find I’d grabbed the wrong can. I was holding garlic powder instead of pepper spray.  
The demon dog looked from me to the can, then came after me. I had just enough time to screw the lid off and shove the can in its mouth.  
It chewed the can to pieces and looked at me with renewed rage. As it took a step toward me, something strange happened. It sneezed once, spraying powder everywhere, then stumbled back and began shaking its head uncontrollably.   
It stumbled around like it was drunk, then ran away, slamming into walls as it went.   
As I ran away, I glanced back to see it rolling on the floor furiously pawing at the sides of its mouth.  
I took a moment to grab the pepper spray out of the bag and stick it in my pocket, then I checked my phone to see if that was the red dot. Unfortunately, the red dot was still there, off in the corner to the left.   
I looked around trying to get my bearings when suddenly the wind picked up. Wind in a basement wasn’t something a was used to, unless someone had just turned on a massive fan.   
It just happened to be coming from the direction I wanted to go. Steeling myself, as my strength returned, I found the wind to be a worthy adversary. It pushed back just as hard as I did, and it was hard to gain much ground. I fought one step at a time to reach my goal. Unable to see where the wind was coming from, I tried to find any obstacles I could hide behind to protect me from the wind, but it wasn’t happening.   
As suddenly as the wind started, it ended, leaving me leaning forward with nothing to fight against. I did a faceplant on the floor, barely remaining conscious.    
I stepped out into a massive room with a ceiling so high I couldn’t see it. Everything looked like it had been burned to a crisp. There was nothing on the walls, and only piles of detritus on the floors. I approached one of the piles as stared at it when I realized it was staring back. A burned human skull sat atop a pile of bones.  
Quickly backing away, I ran into another pile. My eyes grew wide as I tried to get away from both of them. Standing in the middle of the room, I counted twelve piles.   
Twelve sets of charred human bones.  
My eyes darted around trying to find what could have done this when the biggest pile rose out of the floor leaving the other piles falling from above, and raining bones down on me.  
I dove near the wall and huddled covering my head to protect myself from the falling skeletal remains.   
The rumble of the floor was deafening. I covered my ears and tried to see what was causing all the noise.   
Finally the dust cleared, revealing a massive, honest to God, living, breathing dragon.  
I was stuck somewhere between awe and terror. When it turned its huge, scaly head and looked right at me, awe fell away and only terror was left.  
I pulled out my can of pepper spray and held it in my shaking hand.   
The dragon narrowed its eyes at me making me shake all over and nearly lose bladder control. It drew close to me and sniffed, first at me, then at my pack.   
I dug into it, keeping a close eye on the dragon so I didn’t get distracted and become a snack. I wondered what it would find so interesting when I stumbled across the hot sauce. Pulling out a bottle, I unscrewed the lid them tossed it to the creature. It opened its massive fang filling mouth and caught the bottle.  
I crossed my fingers and started scootching along the wall away from the beast as it focused on whether it liked the flavor or not. It wasn’t long until a massive claw slammed down in front of me, blocking my path.   
Closing my eyes, I prayed for a quick death. But after a minute, nothing had happened. I opened one eye and peeked at the dragon. Its mouth was open like it was frozen in place.   
On a hunch, I opened another bottle and threw it in. It closed its mouth and I swear it made a, ‘Yumm’ sound.  
The mouth opened again, creeping just a bit closer. I tossed in another bottle, glancing at the two remaining and wondering what would happen when the treats were gone. I had a sinking suspicion I knew.  
With the next bottle, I held it up but didn’t throw it immediately into the dragon’s mouth. Instead, I threw it across the room as far as I could. The effect was immediate. It swung around and chased after it, nearly hitting me with its tail in its haste.  
I took advantage of the situation and ran behind it, hoping that would be the last place it looked.   
It wasn’t long until it had found and devoured the bottle, then turned back to where I had been. I stayed behind it, turning as it turned playing a deadly game of hide and seek.   
The roar it bellowed terrified me, but I knew I had to keep my wits about me. I had a chance here, and I didn’t want to blow it.   
The dragon stomped around near where I had been, sniffing and slowly turning. I knew it had caught my scent.   
There was one card left to play. I stood in the middle of the room, allowing it to find me and held up the last bottle.   
It lowered its head and I swear it wagged its tail.   
While looking around, I spotted a door on the far end of the room. I threw the bottle in the opposite direction and waited a split second for it to chase the bottle before I sprinted toward the door.  
I was nearly there when I heard flapping. The giant feet landed in front of me, kicking up a cloud of dust that flooded my lungs and brought me to my knees in a coughing fit.   
As the cloud cleared I saw two eyes staring at me, blocking my escape. I waited for death, knowing the beast knew I had tricked it. It took a step toward me, its breath nearly knocking me over.   
A low growl vibrated the air, I knew I was dead.   
It opened its mouth.   
I waited.  
And waited.  
It wanted more snacks, but I didn’t have any. Vainly I searched through my bag for anything, but there was nothing. In desperation I patted my pockets.   
The pepper spray.  
I threw it as far away from the door as I could and waited for the dragon to chase it. To my surprise, it looked at me with a confused and almost sad expression, then turned and chased after the can.  
Ripping the door open, I turned and slammed it shut, then slid against it down to the floor.   
Closing my eyes, I sat and took a breather. Whatever came next, I wanted to be as ready as I could be.   
I knew the dragon room hadn’t been as bad as it could have been, but I also knew once it discovered there were no more treats, I was next on the menu.   
Opening my eyes and looking around the room, there was an eerie putrid glow coming from the two torches standing side by side, illuminating the mist that clung to the floor.  
The mist wasn’t cool and refreshing, it felt hot, like it had come from the bowels of hell.   
I rested for a moment then made sure I had my pack strapped on and started toward the torches.   
As I arrived, flames sprang to life on another set of torches in front of me. As I was led further into the room, my eyes darted left and right, watching for a sneak attack. This continued further until I stood in front of a raised dais with a throne on it. Sitting on the throne was a nightmare.    
It was the most hideous creature I’d ever seen. It looked like a demon from a horror movie times ten. Horns covered every inch of its red skin. The thing was huge, easily dwarfing the massive throne. Its piercing eyes drilled into my soul, making me tremble.   
As soon as I saw it, I hesitated, wondering if I wanted to approach or if the choice had already been made once it saw me.   
My eyes shot to the sides of the room, searching for the escape door, but all I saw was a stairway.  
“Come forward,” it said in a deep voice that sounded like a thousand at once.   
It wasn’t a request, it was a command.  
I took a single hesitant step.  
“You’ve done well to come this far,” it said. “But your challenge in this room is one of choice. Before you there is a stairway. One side leads up, the other down. You must choose. One will lead you back to the main hall, and the other will lead to continued trails and torment. The choice is yours.”  
A thousand questions ran through my mind, but looking up into that terrifying nightmare face, they all died on my lips.   
I stepped over in front of the stairs as the creature watched me with a bemused look on its face.   
The stairs showed no indication of which choice to make. There were no symbols, no puzzle to figure out, no key to unlock, only a stark brazen choice.  
Conventional wisdom would say up would be the side to pick, however nothing in this place was conventional.   
Moments passed like falling rain. Every thought of choices made paraded through my mind. The repercussions of the choice were great. I was tired and had enough of this place for the night. I wasn’t sure I’d survive going deeper into the bowels of this ordeal.  
Suddenly I was reminded of the words the sheriff told me earlier this evening, ‘Whenever you get stuck, remember up is down’.  
Could it really be that simple? Could this be the thing he was talking about? Maybe he meant something else and this was just a coincidence. The choice was immensely important, I knew I couldn’t survive much longer down here.  
I decided to trust the only piece of information I had.  
Stepping over to the downward stairs, I looked into the depths.  
The beast on the throne scoffed.   
“Are you sure?” it said in its growling multitude of voices.  
“No,” I said, looking from it to the steps.  
 I proceeded down into the darkness, thankful that I had brought more flashlights with me. Turning one on and looking around there was nothing special about the stairs. They were made of stone along with the walls and ceiling. They seemed to go on forever. There was no break, no landing, only constant darkness. Several times I paused and looked back up the endless stairs, temped to go back.   
In the end, I continued on with my choice. After what seemed like forever, I came to the bottom of the stairs. There was no door, no nothing except a floor and a mirror.   
I approached it and reached forward, only to have an arm reach out and grab me, yanking me in.  
Before I knew it, I was falling. The floor hit me hard, knocking the wind out of me. My backpack came next, landing on my head and making me regret how much supplies I had brought along.  
As I laid there, seeing stars and trying to breathe, a face appeared, inches from my nose.  
“I trust you found your second night as interesting as your first,” the smiling curator said.  
There were several answers I wanted to give him. In the end it was most fortunate that I couldn’t breathe at the moment.  
Once recovered, I stood and checked the time. Somehow, it was nine in the morning. Whether my two trips through the looking glass had warped time or my pack landing on my head had knocked me unconscious.  
The curator watched me with a sly grin, seeming to drink in my confusion with great amusement.  
“Your pay is already sitting on the desk,” he said. “Will I be seeing you later this evening for another night?”  
I walked over and picked up the stack of cash, ignoring the paper with the words, ‘I’d rather be lucky than good,’ on it.  
Sure enough, it was twice the amount as last night.   
“Would all my shifts pay the same?” I asked.  
He nodded.  
“When would my days off be?”  
He cocked his head to the side as if trying to understand the question.   
“To be determined,” he said, then disappeared.  
I walked toward the door, wondering if I’d ever get used to his disappearing act. Then I thought about what he said. If my days off are to be determined, does that mean I won’t get any? Or maybe I won’t get any until the museum gets the best of me and I stay there forever as a ghost.  
Opening the door and walking out into the bright morning light, I wondered when that would be.
