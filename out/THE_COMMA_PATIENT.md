My name’s George. I’ve been a nurse for a little over a year, and I thought I had seen enough night shifts to know how they go. You learn the rhythms: the quiet hours, the occasional emergency, the exhaustion, the silence that presses on your skull like weight.

But the hospital where I work now isn’t like the ones I trained in. It’s in the heart of the city, a private hospital which is called "metropolitan hospital" built to look more like a five-star hotel than a place for the sick. The marble floors gleam. The walls are lined with abstract art. The elevators are chrome and glass, whisper-quiet. Patients who can afford it live here in luxury suites, beds draped in linen sheets, bathrooms nicer than most apartments.

But beneath the polished surface, the hospital has something else. Something hidden.

The coma ward.

The ward isn’t advertised on the hospital website, and you won’t find a sign for it on the upper floors. It sits lower, down a long, narrow corridor at the back of the building, isolated from the hotel-like wards above. The lights there are dimmer, the walls bare. There are no windows. The air is always too cold, like the ventilation system is trying to preserve something.

Most of the staff avoid it. Even on night shift, when assignments rotate, the coma floor gets handed off like a punishment. People mutter excuses—“I’ve got ICU tonight” or “The ER’s short-staffed.” Somehow, I ended up being the one to cover it.

At first, I told myself it was fine. Patients in comas don’t make demands, don’t buzz the nurses’ station every ten minutes. All I had to do was check vitals, adjust machines, and keep the logs updated. Simple.

That’s what I thought,until last night.


It was 1:30 a.m. The coma ward was silent except for the steady hiss of ventilators and the slow, mechanical beeping of heart monitors. Fifteen patients lay in their beds, unmoving. The machines kept them alive, and the machines were the only sound.

I walked my rounds. Room 501,stable. Room 502,stable. Room 503,stable. I moved like clockwork, scanning numbers, writing them down. I tried not to look too closely at their faces.

By the time I reached Room 508, I was starting to feel that familiar unease, like I wasn’t the only one walking the ward. The ceiling lights buzzed faintly overhead, and I thought I heard footsteps echoing behind me, but when I turned, the hallway was empty.

I stepped into 508. The patient was a man in his fifties, brain-dead for months after a car crash. His chart said no chance of recovery.

The monitor by his bed flickered. Just once. Then again. The heart rate, steady at 60 beats per minute, suddenly spiked to 110.

I froze. “That’s… not right.”

I leaned closer, checking the leads, the machine. Everything was attached properly. The rhythm kept climbing, peaking at 140. Then, just as suddenly, it dropped back to 60, steady and calm as though nothing had happened.

I was about to log it when I heard it.

A whisper.

I stopped breathing. My eyes darted to the patient. His chest rose and fell with the ventilator. His eyes were closed. His body was motionless. But the whisper was there—faint, broken, like wind passing through a crack.

“…George…”

My name.

I stumbled back so hard I hit the wall. “No… no, no, no.” I knew what I’d heard. My own name, clear enough to cut through the mechanical noise.

I ran into the hall, heart hammering. The corridor was empty, silent. But the other monitors—the ones in the rooms I’d just passed—were flickering. Little glitches, pulses of light across the hallway windows.

Room 504. Room 505. Room 506.

All of them.

I wanted to call someone. Lena, the nurse from the last story, would’ve laughed and said I was overtired. Security would’ve told me to sit down, drink water, stop scaring myself. But I couldn’t move. I just stood there, staring down the length of the coma ward, watching the monitors blink in eerie unison.

And then the whispers began again.

Not one voice this time. Many. Layered, overlapping, spilling out of the patient rooms. Not loud enough to make out every word, but I could hear the rhythm. Breathing in the sounds between machine hisses.

“…we see you…”
“…don’t… don’t sleep…”
“…wake…”

My legs felt like stone. I didn’t go back into 508. I didn’t go back into any room. I walked backwards down the hallway, eyes fixed on the glow of the machines, half expecting one of the patients to sit up at any second.

The ward doors slid open with a hiss. The sound of the ventilators and the whispers stopped the instant I stepped out.

Silence.

The hospital above was as calm and polished as ever, the luxury wards glowing with soft light, the marble floors shining. For a moment I thought I’d lost my mind completely—that exhaustion had broken me.

But I can’t forget what I heard. The way they whispered my name. The way the machines flickered together, like they were sharing something.

It’s 2 a.m. now. I’m sitting in the staff lounge, lights off, staring at the clock. My next round is in fifteen minutes, and the coma ward is waiting.

I don’t want to go back down there.

Because I’m starting to think… those patients aren’t asleep. Not really.

They’re awake, and they’ve been watching us the whole time.
