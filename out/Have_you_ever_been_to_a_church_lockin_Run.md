**The Damsel’s Log**


My name isn’t exactly important, but my story is. I’m an 18 year old girl whose family has been members of the Eternal Jubilee Church for the last eight years. We haven’t missed a service or event in years and my father has become a deacon in the last few months. My parents do well enough to accommodate the church’s above average tithing expectations. 

They give 15% of both their incomes every week and also donate to every “charity” drive the pastor comes up with. Given our rank within the church, our family attends “higher tier” services for more “devout” members. However, we are still considered high-middle followers and there are services not even my father can attend.

It wasn’t always this way, I remember my family briefly going to a tiny baptist chapel before the move. One of my earliest memories was seeing a plush lamb with a pretty blue bow in a Sunday School class.  I wanted it so bad, I’d draw pictures of it constantly. Hell, sometimes to this day I’ll think of that stupid lamb and its pretty blue bow. I wish we had stayed with that pretty little chapel in that pretty little town. I’d take the lamb over the bull anyday. Christ over Sinclair.

My family was struggling financially before the move here, fighting tooth and nail just to put food on the table. We bounced from place to place with more “fresh starts” than I can count. Dad was a terrible businessman and loose with his pocket. He ruined many career paths in many different towns through his poor decisions and drinking. We even lived in his van for a month or two. Waking up to my father having a mental breakdown over the five grand in parking tickets has been forever burned into my mind. We were on our last legs before stumbling into this town… It was just as rough at first, until dad came into contact with a strange man in a strange suit. A “pastor” by the name of Lysander Sinclair, this odd man took great interest in our family. He was like a cartoon character brought into our world, just so strange and brightly colored. 

A former rockstar, you could tell Lysander never quite let go of the past. I’ve listened to his old music a few times. Not a whole lot to write home about. His biggest hit song: “The Krazy Kourt of the Kobra King” only barely edged into the Top 40 for a few weeks. “Godspeed Street”, “Rebuilding Sodom”, and “the Ballad of Avery Caine” are decent songs for what they are but that was more of Rico St. Wilde’s and Randy Raine’s talent.  Though, Lysander Sinclair has nothing positive to say about them.

Say what you will about the pastor, but for the first time our family began to thrive. Finally landing a well paying position, dad decided we would stay in this town. Our family was always spiritual, but not very religious. I suppose this is why my parents converted religions so quickly. The religion that is actually taught within the Eternal Jubilee isn’t exactly Christianity, more like something hiding behind it. It has the facade of a Southern Baptist church, though this couldn’t be further from the truth. 

The teachings of the Eternal Jubilee don't come from a Bible and for that matter you won’t find one anywhere near the “church”. Lysander and his assistant pastors teach from the “Gospel of Aaron,” a lengthy garble of conflicting verses and strange stories. Mostly kept vague, fluid, and ambiguous; the actual doctrine is surprisingly sleazy. I never personally understood any of it, but my family has never been more successful. 

I was always heavily involved with the youth ministry and as I aged, it became expected of me to become one of the church’s youth leaders. The youth pastors are somewhat of Lysander’s personal pet projects, as his assistant pastors are some of his oldest associates who blew into town with him. Youthful, vain, and eager to please; the “Young Apostles” are disturbed men and women who have been guided by Lysander’s hand. This rogue’s gallery consisted of Lane Vandross, Irene Cogdall, Anthony Pearson, Missy Fleming, Noah Lyman, Connie Underwood, and Damian Randalls. There were many more, but these are the most prominent within the contrived hierarchy of the church. Children of lower caste families would be forced to attend different events with different leaders.

Overall our youth ministry was led by Lane Vandross, an extremely volatile man and by far the most zealous of the lot. While not as manipulative as Irene or as snide as Noah, Lane was a powder keg of abrasiveness and intense devotion with a fragile ego as a perpetually lit fuse. All were desperate for Lysander’s attention, though, none were as competitive as Lane Vandross. Though never directly stated, one can sense the deep seated hatred and jealousy each held for one another. Maybe Lane could sense my hidden apathy towards the religion; his eyes would scan me up and down almost like he was trying to locate a threat. 

Out of all of them, Connie Underwood was the least high strung. While the rest fought tooth and nail for any sign of the pastor’s approval, Connie just seemed to have stumbled into the church one day. She was just kinda there but Lysander adored her, much to the rest’s ire. Not very bright but beautiful, physically and emotionally, Connie was the only one I felt comfortable talking to.

For all the years within the church, I would feel an occasional unease but nothing like that night… A blessing and a curse, it opened eyes I didn’t even know were shut. If you haven’t heard of a youth lock-in, it’s a relatively normal event held in churches. Usually kids spend the night at a church, play games, listen to a sermon or two, and try to pull an all-nighter. They sound fun in theory, but from experience they have a weird vibe. Me and the youth pastors were chaperoning such an event one night, locking ourselves and about twenty teens/pre-teens in the higher-tier youth building.

Our youth building was huge and maze-like; consisting of a massive gymnasium, a parlor, a kitchen, ten different classrooms, and other seemingly purposeless rooms. They went all out on our lock-in: we had music, tons of pizza, huge inflatable games, etc. Understandably, mixing teenage hormones with sugar, excitement, and exhaustion is a horrible combination. 

It was all going relatively well, until one of Lane’s sermons. Lane, his hair stylized like a young Lysander’s, droned on and on in what seemed more like a rant than a service.

“And I say unto you: the abnormal, the shunned, the freethinkers, the star-crossed lovers… Do you not yearn for true freedom? Not their freedom, not society’s freedom, but the Bull’s freedom. Society pressures us to conform, to embrace a blasphemous normality.” Lane’s emotions were getting the better of him, before long he was shrieking at the top of his lungs with teary eyes. He gently rested a hand on an ominous wooden box lying on a podium.

“They and their false gods want to tell us what is right and what is wrong, what is moral and what is amoral? But the Gospel of Aaron tells us our god abhors chains, he abhors rules and boundaries. We are taught to sharpen our horns and break all chains of oppression, any jailer or master must be given to the rack! The Bull gives us the strength to rebel, to spit in the face of the self righteous!” Lane howled before plunging his hand inside the wooden box, yanking out a writhing ribbon with an audible gasp from the congregation.

Holding it up for all to see, it was a timber rattlesnake, hissing and thrashing violently against Lane’s hand. Rattling its tail wildly, most took a few steps back while Lane slowly walked towards the congregation. Without proper treatment and antivenom, a bite from this snake could easily be fatal.

“I have faith in my freedom and I have faith in our god, for he protects and provides for his herd… If my words are false and my faith untrue, strike me serpent, let me taste your venom!”  Lane, his voice full of bravado, held out his muscular forearm within striking distance of the snake. While the snake hissed and rattled, it refused to bite Lane’s wrist. A smile of arrogance and satisfaction was plastered to his face, he’s lucky he didn’t kill himself. 

“Anyone else wish to test their faith?” Lane giggled, sauntering his way to kids trying to shrink away from the serpent. Lane’s eyes focused on me, gaining that suspicious gaze. His smile was beautiful, but oh so terrible…

“Don’t be shy, sister… The Bull protects the beautiful,” Lane cooed, running his free hand sensually through my hair. I don’t know which was more appalling, the snake or the sweet cologne that clung to everything in a 10 mile radius of him. Cornered by a man far bigger than me, there was no escape. Slowly inching the snake closer to me, I surely thought I was about to be bitten.

“Brother Lane, that’s enough. Stop it, please.” I squeaked, which must have been the funniest thing Lane Vandross has ever heard. Almost collapsing from a laughing fit, Lane put a hand on my shoulder.

“Modest. Our sister doesn’t wish to show us how pure her faith is? You think you’d show us up? It’s ok, sister, the Bull loves the prideful. Modesty is a deadly flaw… Remember, instinct is law.” Lane spat coldly before reaching the snake out to Connie Underwood’s neck. With a quick strike, the youth leader fell to her knees in pain. Connie’s bright blue eyes widened with the cold realization, gripping the bite mark on her neck. Connie was a tiny woman, blonde and pretty, but her face couldn’t have looked more frail in that moment. Of course, the children were petrified, but they looked more terrified of Connie than they did of Lane. 

I don’t really know what I would’ve done, but I instinctively pushed my way past Lane to help Connie. Only to be halted by Irene, her scowl and tacky eyeshadow made her look almost demonic. If there is no evil left in this world, that means Irene Cogdall is dead and buried.  A raven-haired, buxom woman of screaming sensuality; she was the prettiest of us all, save for Lane. Subtle, manipulative, and spiteful; Irene was far more dangerous than she seemed. She often played the dangerous game of trying to mold Lane’s impulsiveness to her gain, this will lead to her demise one day. Trust me.

“She was unfaithful, sister… We needed to know…” Irene said sweetly, her grip on my shoulder tightening with every syllable. 

“Finally… I was getting tired of her voice…” Brother Noah smirked in his usual scornful tone.

“Well, can’t say that I’m surprised,” Lane spat as he kneeled to Connie’s level. “When a sheep tries to run with the bulls, what do you think will happen? Did you really think Lysander wouldn’t have tossed you aside eventually? False prophet… Sheep… I knew it all along… This is what happens to the unfaithful! Do you know what mistake you made?”

“Y-y-yes Brother Lane,” she choked out a weak response.

“It’s a shame, Connie… You really could have tended your soul’s soil, instead of just playing in the garden…” Brother Anthony said, feigning sympathy. 

“Brother Anthony, Brother Noah! Help me take Ms. Underwood out back… Brother Damien and the sisters… Make sure everyone is having fun, I don’t want to see a frown when I get back…” Lane chuckled, throwing the serpent to the ground. With one brutal stomp, Lane crushed the animal’s head. 

I stuck mostly to myself after that, slowly bouncing from room to room without direction. Around 2 AM, most kids gave up on the all-nighter. I doubt many could actually sleep after seeing tonight’s incident, but many pretended to. Those who didn’t give up stuck to themselves in groups of three or four, quietly muttering between themselves. Any ounce of teenage rebellion was snuffed out, struck down by the rattlesnake’s strike.

Lane and the rest were gone for several hours, coming back jittery and somehow more erratic. As the children stuck quietly in their spots, Lane called a private meeting between the chaperones in the parlor.

I never quite knew what happened to Connie after that, they say she was taken to the hospital and simply excommunicated from the church for her “apathy to the cause”. You’d be a fool to trust any word coming out of Lane Vandross’ mouth.

“Pastor Lysander has been informed about tonight’s incident… The way a non-believer was able to rise up amongst us is concerning. He made it very clear that our congregation will not suffer another sheep in our midst.” Lane said, focusing his gaze on Damian Randalls.

Brother Damian was a newcomer, a lithe and athletic man who has quickly risen up in our ranks. Gaining Lysander’s attention and confidence, Lane greatly despises Damian because of this. Curly headed and eyes the color of oak, Brother Damian was especially popular within the congregation.

“Why are you staring at me, Brother Lane? I have proven my faith, time and time again…” Damian muttered, quickly raising his guard to Lane’s suspicion.

“Well, any stranger taken off the street will raise suspicion… You’ve only been with us for what, like a month or two? Connie blew in from nowhere, rose up quickly just like you. As far as I’m concerned, you’re Connie with a cock. Or maybe it’s the other way around…” Lane hissed.


“You think I’m afraid of you, Vandross? Do you think any of us here actually respect you? The snake was a nice trick, but a simple animal doesn’t decide the Bull’s will. Damn fool.” Damian retorted, his voice seasoned by malice.

“Watch your tongue, do you know who you’re talking to?” Lane growled in utter disgust and disbelief.

“The pastor grows bored of you, it’s in his eyes. I can see it, they can see it, and you can see it. He’s dumped you for a better model… Before long, you’ll just be another no-name low tier…” Damian laughed.

Seething with vitriol, Lane flung himself at Damian with a vicious punch. Quickly darting to the side, Damian countered with a quick jab to Lane’s jaw. Lane may have been far bigger and stronger, but none of his blows managed to connect. Faster and with better form, Damian responded with quick strikes to every missed punch Lane threw. Lane was quick for his size, yet, not quick enough. Now on the defensive, it seemed like the big man was being dismantled by a series of well-placed blows. Damian’s triumph was short lived for as quick and disciplined as he was, Lane’s hatred was far greater. 

Lane’s punches were savage things, obviously telegraphed, but each punch was obviously intended to kill. A tragic misstep led to one of Lane’s brutal punches finally connecting with Damian’s head. With that single punch, the fight was over. Unleashing a feral barrage of punches, Damian was knocked around like a plastic bag in the wind. Grabbing Damian’s hair, Lane then stomped on the back of his calf before lackadaisically throwing his head to the ground. To Lane, it was far from over. 

Descending on the broken and beaten Damian, Lane continued to brutalize the young man. Over and over and over, the punches flew. 

“GODDAMN… LIAR…” Lane spat, holding up his bloody fist victoriously to the heavens, almost like to show God his work.

“Is he alive?” Anthony asked.

“What does it matter if a sheep lives or dies?” Lane asked quietly, as he loomed over Brother Anthony.

Brother Anthony turned snow white, stammering out a sheepish response: “I-I-I was just curious, it’s up to the Bull now.”

Lane smirked, knowing damn well he almost made Anthony Pearson piss himself. 

“He’s alive, barely, but alive. The pastor is not going to be happy with you breaking his brand new play thing, Brother Lane” Noah quipped. Lane’s face darkened as he slowly approached Noah, putting a firm hand on his tiny shoulder. Noah Lyman never quite knew when to hold his tongue. A slender and effeminate man, Lane Vandross could snap him like dry wood.

“I think you should stop talking for the rest of the night, Brother Noah. I don’t want to hear a fucking peep out of you until I can see sunlight.” 

Noah slowly nodded as Lane patted him on the back. 

They’ve always been aggressive, but nothing ever like this… I needed to get out of here. I needed to survive. These people are fucking insane, I need to leave this town. Find a nice little town with a nice little chapel. Pushing my way out of the parlor, I ran through the maze-like hallways desperately looking for an unlocked exit. 

The fluorescent lights began to flicker, before gaining an unnatural golden glow. Emitting a pleasant and warm sensation, my escape was then hindered by a thousand thoughts of doubt. This is normal, they said. It had to be done, they said. Where would you go, they asked. This place gave you everything… Without the Bull, you’d have nothing….

The halls began to twist and stretch, doors I’ve never seen before began to appear. Before long, I was lost in a building I’ve been in thousands of times. Closets contorted into new hallways and horned shadows danced on the walls. Where was I? 

Reaching a gilded door consumed in grapevines, I was frozen in my tracks by an all consuming feeling of dread. I wasn’t alone in these hallways. The door slowly creaked open on its own, revealing a mighty bull. Pale and hairless, it had a golden bow wrapped around its thickly muscled neck. Skewered upon its gilded horns, a lamb writhed and bleated in pain. Its blood flowed upward, staining the ceiling in a thick crimson. 

I tried to run, but fell drunkenly to my knees. My vision was blurred and my speech slurred, I was drunk by its presence. Golden grape vines began to viciously wrap around my body, killing all hopes of escape. 

Five pale men or women, I couldn’t exactly tell, appeared around the bull. Mighty gilded horns grew from their temples and vines of gold wrapped around their supple bodies. 

“BEAR WITNESS…” They chanted, before plunging blades into the great hairless bull. As soon as their daggers made contact, I was back in the youth building. In some random closet, in fact. I was dazed and confused, maybe it was some type of mental break due to the trauma. Well that’s what I thought, until I found the coin in my pocket.

A shiny coin of gold, engraved with a group of naked people surrounding a bull. A bloody hand was gently placed on my shoulder, it was Lane.

“Well looks like someone had their first encounter with the Muses… Maybe you have potential after all, sister. Pastor Lysander will be ecstatic…” Lane uttered, as his grip tightened on my shoulder.
