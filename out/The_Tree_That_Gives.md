When we first moved into the old house on Hollow Pines Road, my twin brother, Ben, and I agreed that we had a responsibility to renovate it and restore it to its former glory. After all, this was our father's favourite place, and we had inherited it off him. We had no idea that it would become our dream home, too.

The house was huge, with a creaky staircase and wallpaper peeling at the edges. The wooden floors groaned with every step. The backyard was wild, almost more forest than lawn, dominated by a massive, ancient oak tree. Its trunk was dark, almost black, and its twisted roots jutted out of the ground like skeletal fingers.

“That thing is a monster,” Ben said the first time we saw it. “Bet it’s older than the house.”

I shrugged. “It’s just a tree.”

But Ben seemed drawn to it. While I focused on unpacking, he spent a lot of time outside, sitting beneath its shadow, his back against the trunk. I didn’t think much of it - Ben was always the outdoorsy type - but then things started to get... strange.

One night, a few days after we moved in, I woke up to the sound of the back door creaking open. I got up to check it out, figuring it was just the wind, but as I peeked through the kitchen window, I saw Ben heading toward the tree, barefoot and shirtless.

“Ben?” I called, but he didn’t stop.

I followed him outside, shivering in the cool night air. “What are you doing?”

Ben jumped like he hadn’t heard me coming. He quickly turned, hiding something behind his back.

“Nothing,” he said, too quickly. “Just... couldn’t sleep.”

I stepped closer, and that’s when I noticed the black smears on his hands and mouth. “What the hell is that?”

It looked like he had been eating it.

Ben hesitated, his eyes darting between me and the tree. “It's sap, I think. I must have been sleepwalking”

“That’s disgusting,” I said, stepping back.

He gave me a weak smile. “I’m fine. Seriously. Just... forget this happened, okay? My heads all over the place.”

I stared at him for a long moment, unsure of what to say. Finally, I nodded and went back inside, but I couldn’t shake the unease that settled in my chest.

For a while, things seemed normal. Ben, for some time, didn't sneak out at night - at least as far as I knew - and we both settled into a routine. But then, a few weeks later, I started noticing changes.

Ben became distant. He’d sit at the kitchen table, staring out the window at the tree for hours. His appetite vanished, and his skin grew pale, almost green. His once vibrant baby blue eyes were now grey, as if the life had been drained from them.

“Are you feeling okay?” I asked one morning.

Ben nodded, his gaze still fixed on the backyard. “Never better.”

But I didn’t believe him. Honestly, at this point, I suspected drugs. But the reality was absolutely insane.

One night, I woke up again to the sound of the back door creaking open. This time, I didn’t call out, I kept quiet. I followed Ben, I watched, I kept my distance, and Ben made his way to the tree.

He knelt at its base, digging at the ground with his bare hands. Black goo oozed up from the soil, thick and viscous, like tar. Ben scooped it up and brought it to his mouth, licking it off his fingers.

I rustled through the bush, moving closer to him.

Ben froze, his hand still halfway to his mouth. Slowly, he turned to face me, and in the moonlight, I could see that his teeth were stained black.

Shit. He heard me.

“I told you not to follow me,” he said, his voice low and strained.

“You’re eating... that?” I gestured to the goo, my stomach turning. “Why?”

Ben’s lips curled into a strange, almost euphoric smile.

“You’re scaring me.” I said, stepping back.

Ben sighed, leaning back against the tree. “It’s like... it gives you something. It’s not just food. It’s...” He paused, searching for the right words. “It’s pleasure, Tom. Pure, unfiltered pleasure.”

I stared at him, my mind reeling. “You’re getting off on eating tree goo?”

“It’s not like that,” Ben insisted, though his face flushed with embarrassment. “It’s more than that. It’s like... the tree knows what you want. What you need.”

“That’s insane,” I said, backing away. “You need to stop.”

Ben shook his head. “You don’t get it. You have to try it. Just once.”

“No way,” I said, turning to leave. “You’re on your own.”

But the next night, the whispers started.

At first, I thought it was the wind rustling through the leaves, but then I heard my name.

“Tommy... come to me...”

The voice was soft, almost soothing. It sounded like childhood comfort, peace, and just like our dad. I tried to ignore it, but the whispering continued, growing louder, more insistent.

“Tommy... you’ll feel so much better...”

By the third night, I couldn’t take it anymore. I found myself standing next to my brother at the base of the tree, my hands trembling, both in silence. The black goo seeped from the ground, thick and inviting, as my brother consumed.

“Just one taste,” the voice urged. “And you’ll understand.”

I reached out, my fingers sinking into the goo. It was warm, almost comforting. I hesitated for a moment, but the voice whispered again, and I brought my hand to my mouth.

The moment it touched my tongue, everything else disappeared. A wave of pure, unrelenting pleasure crashed over me, so intense that I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think. My body convulsed, every nerve igniting in ecstasy.

I collapsed against the tree, gasping. The pleasure didn’t stop; it kept building, higher and higher, until it was unbearable - and still, I wanted more.

“See?” Ben moaned, his voice distant. “Now you get it.”

I couldn’t speak. I just nodded, my hands already scooping more of the goo. We sat there together, devouring it, lost in the overwhelming bliss. Nothing else mattered - nothing else existed.

Days passed. Maybe weeks. We stopped going inside. The house was forgotten. We didn’t need food, or water, or sleep. The tree provided everything, filling us with wave after wave of euphoria.

But then, the goo began to change.

It started to pull us in, its sticky warmth spreading over our skin. At first, it was gentle, like a lover’s embrace. But soon, we couldn’t move. Our hands and legs were stuck, our bodies sinking deeper into the roots.

And we didn’t care.

The pleasure was too much, too perfect. We gave ourselves to it willingly, letting the tree take us. The last thing I saw before the goo covered my eyes was Ben’s face, serene and smiling, as he sank into the tree’s embrace.

The tree had us now. We were happy now. Me, Ben, and Dad were comfortable here with the tree on Hollow Pines Road. We want you to join us.
