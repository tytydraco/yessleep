As you can tell from the title I believe I am in danger. I think something is after me. I don't know how and I don't know why but I can not seem to shake off this feeling of dread. I guess the only appropriate way to start explaining myself is from the very beginning. 



Horror, I love it. I love horror movies, books, video games, even the obviously fake ghost hunting tv shows. Anything and everything that gives me that scared adrenaline rush that I absolutely crave, I love. I would say I have been like this since I was a little kid, watching child's play 2 and being totally terrified from the mere sight of the red headed doll. I remember staying up late playing Call of duty black ops zombies and not being able to sleep, hearing the vicious screeches from the zombies even after I had turned off my Xbox 360. Looking back it's funny to think of how easily it was to get scared as a kid, but it's also kind of sad. Now at nineteen it's not so easy, I can't just watch a scary movie or play a horror video game or read a Stephen King book. In a way I've become desensitized to it all. Growing up that adrenaline rush of fear has become harder and harder to achieve. I think that's what made me do it. I think that's why I went there. 



Living in Scotland the only piece of creepy folklore I can think of is the infamous loch ness monster and even at that it is definitely not horrifying. More of a mythical creature and not what I was searching for. What I wanted was a haunted house or a cursed woods, anything remotely disturbing to check out. After a quick google search all I could find were abandoned castles and ghostly pubs, nothing that I would waste my time actually going too. After a while I gave up on the idea and accepted that nothing was going to take me back to the tasty terror I had savoured as a kid. That was until I met Jack. 



Me and Jack met in college and instantly bonded over our shared love of (you guessed) horror. Glasgow college gave us more than enough time to commerce in our personal views of classic monster movies and who we thought was the best slasher or what book gave us the most goosebumps. (pun intended) It did not take long for me to admit to him my problem, that being that I just thought I'd never genuinely be scared again. Likewise he shared he had the exact same issue. I was relieved to hear this and soon enough both of us started searching. 



I tried looking online again to find more of the same. I even asked my mom and dad if there were any urban legends or myths when they were little but disinterested they only gave me a plain “no.” Meeting back with Jack the following Monday I felt as if I had failed, with nothing to report to him I stayed quiet, that's when he first told me the story.



“ What you said made me think and I remembered some fucked up thing that happened literally in my local town.” 

“ What happened?”

“ I can't remember all the details but some guy went crazy and hung his whole family one by one then did the same to himself all on the same tree. It was like a tree outside his house or something but that's not the fucked up part. 

“ That's not the fucked up part, well shit continue.”

“ The guy that discovered the bodies reported he saw someone in the Alans ( the family's name) house, staring out the window watching the corpses swing.”

“ That's pretty weird.”

“That's not even the end of it, not even a month later the guy who found the bodies offed himself too and I'm sure you can guess which way he did it. 

In that moment a spark lit up in my eyes, finally something juicy to chew on.  “And this is in your local town.”

“ Yeah right in Helensburgh.” 

That day at lunch we both agreed to pay the tree a visit on the weekend. 



I counted down the days like a child would do for Christmas. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, then at last Saturday. I agreed to meet Jack at the bus station and brought only my essentials. A flashlight for the dark, a small hand camera to video and take pictures and a spirit pod I ordered from Ebay. It's basically a tiny box that flashes multi colors and makes an annoying noise if anything touches it. With that I was ready to be spooked. 



I met Jack at the bus station and we made the decision to see the tree before heading to his house. He told me it wasn't too far and we began the journey. As we passed the grey and muggy streets of Helensburgh we arrived at green. The countryside. Jack told me the front path had been sanctioned off so we made our way around the back. A huge grass hill sprouting out purple and pink flowers from the ground stood in our way. The weather had a sudden change, turning incredibly hot and sunny especially for Scotland. This only made things harder for us climbing the steep hill, being blinded by sunshine. The further we advanced the harder it became, at the last stretch both me and Jack were on all fours gripping the dry turf, pulling ourselves upward. Finally we arrived atop of the hill and it immediately stood out. The tree was huge with arms growing wildly out from its sides, towering over me. It looked ancient and discoloured and all the branches that stuck out were thick. The tree completely blocked the sun and its leaves fell orange. If you were a person to appreciate nature, in a strange way you could almost call it beautiful. 



“ Yeah that's definitely it.” Jack said

“ where did they hang?” I morbidly asked

Jack pointed at one log that appeared completely straight, not too high and not too low, perfect. It even had a twisted hook on the end of the branch that pointed downward. After examining the tree and the long and plumb trunk, Jack walked over and passed it. Following him I saw another key piece to the story. 



“This is or was the Alans house.” Jack proclaimed. The house was normal. An ordinary little family house. It looked a little run down due to it being unattended to but not what I had imagined. I was disappointed and so Jack became as he turned to my unamused face. He unenthusiastically pointed up at a window and said “ That's where the guy saw someone looking out the window.” No words crossed our paths and we stood around bored looking back and forth between the house and tree. I opened my bag and took a picture of both the sadistic attractions. 



“Not really the time of day to be here is it?”

“Not really.” I replied. 

“We could always come back later tonight?” 

“Yeah that'll probably be better, then I could use this thing.” I opened my bag and revealed the spirit pod. After geeking out about it for a few minutes we both decided to return at twelve to put it to use. 



We made our way back stumbling down the green hill. At Jack's house we just hung out, played a bit of FIFA, ordered pizza and watched the classic Wicker man as a warmup for what was ahead. We both sat on Jack's bed scranning away at our pizza when his dad entered the room. 



“ Dad, tell Lewis about what happened to the Alans family.” Jack abruptly commanded his father.

“ Now I don't think Lewis would like to hear about that Jack.” 

“ Yeah dad Lewis is super into creepy shit like that.” His dad looked over to me, raising his eyebrows and I nodded in agreement. 

“Well okay, where to even begin. The Alans had only been here a year before what happened, happened. And I knew Mark Allan (The father) pretty well. He worked in the factory with me.” Jack's dads voice steadily started to sound more shaky. “He was a good guy from what I could tell, nothing about him screamed crazy to me anyway. It's funny. I remember seeing him the day before he did what he did and he was totally fine, normal. And for the guy who witnessed the bodies to do the same thing I think is a load of crap, over exaggerated by people to make it more scary. People trying to create a ghost story out of a tragedy. That's all I can say about it.” His dad refused eye contact, it was as if he was telling this to himself. 



“ Yeah but dad tell him about the tree.”

“ Jack, that's not very appropriate.” He snapped back, giving a look of disapproval.  An awkward silence filled the room which was again interrupted by Jack. 

“Well we were just leaving.”

“Where are you both going?”

“ A party.” Jack instantly and pompously responded.

“A party? Really?” His dad questioned and looked over to me.” Again I nodded in agreement. 

“Well enjoy yourselves and don't be too late Jack, you know how much your mother worries.”

Soon after we left Jack's house and I asked him why he had lied to his dad. He said if his dad knew he was going there he would have killed him. 



The night sky became starless and as dark as I had ever seen it. We passed through neighbourhoods that were lit up by street lights to arrive in the sticks. When we reached the foot of the hill only blackness was visible. Again we trekked up only this time instead of being blinded by light we were blind in the dark. We were nearly halfway up the hill when Jack thankfully reminded me of the flashlight I had packed. I opened the bag and shined the torch forward, this made our sight only slightly better as it only brightened a few feet in front of us. Out of breath we had arrived on top once again. This time the giant tree never stood out, it instead blended in with the night looking like a silhouette of a marionette being controlled by broad wire. We advanced and examined the tree, nothing had changed except for the time of day that definitely turned the tree more monstrous. 



“Should we get the pod out?” I asked. 

“Not yet, let's check the house out.” 

Passing the tree the house appeared to the right of us. Unlike the tree, the house remained the same, harder to make out but you could easily tell it was just a normal small family house. I never realized how cold I was until I reached for my bag and couldn't feel the fabric rub against my hand. It had gone completely numb and made trying to zip my bag open nearly impossible. After fidgeting for a good couple of minutes I eventually pulled both zippers opposite and unsteadily held the camera. I looked behind to see Jack staring over the hill facing another mini mountain in the distance. As I neared he broke silence. He whispered “Lewis… what is that?”



It was far away but not far enough to where we could not notice it staring at us. In front across from us on a similar grass island it stood, watching. Like the tree it appeared shaded in the black night. Looked to be a man still as stone. A million thoughts rushed my mind, why was he looking at us? Why is he out this late? Why is he not moving? Then eventually I concluded maybe we were the creeps standing at a place where a family had died. I believed this until in the distance the shadow started waving. Swinging unnaturally and not moving anything besides its arm. We stayed speechless just looking back at the obscure blurry man. I raised my camera from my chest to my face aiming it forward, ready to click down, but deep in my backpack the pod went off. I fumbled the camera, spilling it to the floor, echo's of a siren blared and flashes of red, blue and green sprayed inside the bag. My heart dropped below and leaped back up as I struggled to re open the bag. Practically ripping it open I took the spirit pod and tried to switch it off but this did not work and removing it from the bag only made it louder so I did the only thing I could think of. I charged at the tree and smashed the pod against it, breaking it in one shatter. Wow that actually scared me a little I remember thinking to myself. I faced back around to Jack and he was kneeling with his arms spread open. 



“ Jack, what the hell are you doing?” I hissed at him to no response. He continued to gaze into the night, his arms untied like a diver just before the fall. I rushed over to him tugging his shoulder. His face was happy, ecstatic, he looked in total euphoria, his grin taking up his entire face. I pulled harder, “Come on man, this isn't funny.” He was focused and entranced in what was ahead of him and he refused to move. I looked over him to see the shaded figure mirroring Jack. Fear had taken me over and adrenaline followed, I grabbed Jack's hooded coat and yanked it back, lashing his neck back with it. I managed to drag him a feet or two until he launched his fingers into the ground holding onto the earth. He let out a passionate yelp and pleaded “No, no don't take me away, let me in please, please I want to stay, I want in please, oh please." His eyes never strayed and his voice changed softly, he was begging me to stop. 



It is hard for me to say this and describe what I did. I tried to take him away but the harder I tried the louder his beseech became. He dropped all his dead weight and I could not continue carrying him away. My horror became too much and I panicked. I ran, ran fast and hard and never looked back, I didn't stop running until I made it to the bus station completely soaked in sweat. When I got home I never slept, kept the light on and lay awake facing the ceiling. It is now the next day and I have managed to get about four hours of sleep. Jack has not answered any calls or texts and I am worried sick. I guess I'm writing this in case anything happens to me. In a way it's funny I got what I wanted, I'm beyond scared, I'm terrified and not only for me. I'm not sure if I am taking a day or two of college or not. I'll update if anything happens or if Jack replies. If you have any information or inquiries a comment definitely wouldn't hurt. Thanks for reading this.
