I have been living in the town of Meadowgrove for nearly half my life now. The town is rather quiet, The only sounds that can be heard during the day are of the kids playing on the streets .I never had any problem or any odd incidence happen to me in the town. However, at the end of the street I lived in there was a house that everyone avoided, The old mansion at the end of the Street was built even before i was born and had been abandoned for years now but every now and then, some people have reported strange lights and sounds seen and heard from the house. but i think it is just to scare us kids from going inside the house.



It was just a random day of summer vacation, Me and my friends were bored out of our minds. It was too hot to do anything that day ,I was just laying on my bed when i got a call from my friend.



"Hello"



"Yo Nathan, I've been sitting inside my house for long enough now. These are the golden days of our lives we cannot waste them just sitting around"



"Well that is true"



"Hey how about we visit that old house down the street ,I have heard rumours about it but never believed that shit"



The thrill of visiting an abandoned house was too much for my teenage brain too resist.



"That is one heck of an idea, we should go this evening" I said



"Heck yeah, I'll get us some flashlights, we gonna search that shit upside down.





The following evening me and my friend met up at our decided place, Armed with flashlights and a sense of adventure, we stepped into the creaky old house. The air was thick with dust and the smell of decay. The house was relatively big from inside and was filled with stuff from the older times, I mean who would leave all this valuable stuff inside and just disappear entirely. 



There was nothing out of ordinary happening inside the house, but i could sense something malicious inside the house.



I was deep in my thoughts when my friend called out my name



"Hey nathan , Come look at this"



I quickly went to where my friend was, He was standing in front of a staircase leading down to a door.



It was the basement of the house.



My friend was very excited to go inside the basement, me on the other hand was hesitant.



"Come on nathan it's just an old basement the only thing we are going to find there are a shit ton of cobwebs" My friend said ,"



I gave in to the talk and reluctantly agreed.

 

The basement was fairly normal at first, Until we found that diary laying on the floor



The diary was very old. It had a torn up cover and very yellow pages. The first few pages were empty but as we kept turning the pages we found some entries. The entries were written by a woman named Margaret, who lived in the house a century ago. The entries were all about her missing husband and how he went missing suddenly. She also wrote about her despair and how much she missed her husband. It was all filled with this until we read the last entry.



 The last entry was disturbing. It read, “He’s here, but not himself. His eyes, they glow in the dark. I fear what he has become.”



"Hey , I think we should get the fuck outta here" I said 



Just as I finished my sentence, we heard a low growl from the shadows. I quickly turned my flashlight towards the sound and what i saw will haunt me for the rest of my life. We saw a pair of glowing eyes staring back at us deep from the shadows. In the dim light, we could make out the figure of a man, but whatever that thing was was surely not human. 



We quickly ran towards the staircase hoping that whatever that thing was , was not hungry that day.



As we ran from the basement towards the main door, I could hear shuffling noises behind me but i never dared to turn around.



We ran from the house, but as we fled, we could hear a voice echoing in the wind, “Margaret, I’ve come home.” Me and my friend quickly went to my house, locked all doors and prayed that we were not being followed.



After that day I've started believing in the paranormal, I also started going to church every Sunday.



That old house still stands today, But all i know is i am never stepping foot inside that house again.
