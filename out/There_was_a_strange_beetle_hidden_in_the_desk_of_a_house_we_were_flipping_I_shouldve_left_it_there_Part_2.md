I'm starting to freak out a [little.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lqzt9v/there_was_a_strange_beetle_hidden_in_the_desk_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Actually, scratch that, I'm starting to freak out a lot.

I keep finding the stone bug in my hand, without any memory of picking it up.

I lock it in my desk drawer. Twenty minutes later, I'm holding it while brushing my teeth, and I don't remember taking it out. The drawer is still locked.

I put it in the freezer, wedged behind a bag of frozen peas. I'm watching TV when I look down and there it is, clenched in my fist. My hand is numb from the cold, but I have no memory of going to the kitchen.

I seal it in a box, inside another box, and tape the whole thing shut with an entire roll of duct tape. I hide it in my closet, behind old textbooks. An hour later, I'm holding it again. The boxes are still in the closet, still sealed, still covered in gray tape.

I'm starting to lose it. Really lose it.

A quick search online tells me it's a Scarabaeus sacer. A dung beetle. A scarab. But not like the ones on the museum websites. Those are flat on one side and stylized, with Egyptian carvings. Mine is completely three-dimensional and disturbingly lifelike. I'm still not sure what it's made of.

I put it in my pocket. Not like anything else has helped. Then I head over to my parents' house. When in doubt, pretend everything is normal.

I promised my mom I'd mow the yard for my dad while they go visit my sister. His knees are giving out after years of factory work, and helping them out is the least I can do for them. They *are* putting me through college after all.

I'm almost done with the front yard when my throat starts to feel weird. Tight. Like something is stuck back there. I try to swallow, but it won't go down. If anything, it feels like it's moving upward.

I turn off the mower and lean against the fence, trying to cough up whatever it is loose. But it won't come up. It just sits there, tickling the back of my throat.

Finally, I double over and hack as hard as I can.

Something hits the driveway.

I stare down at it, my heart pounding.

There, sitting on the sun-bleached grey concrete, is a small, thin object. About an inch long. Jagged. Curved.

A leg.

It looks just like one of the beetle's limbs. Same dull greenish-gray. It's wet. Slimy. There's still saliva clinging to it.

I stumble backward, nearly tripping over the mower. My hands are shaking as I reach into my pocket.

The scarab is still there. I pull it out, turning it over in my palm.

All six legs are in place. None missing.

I look back at the driveway. The leg is still there, glistening in the afternoon sun.

I'm on my hands and knees, dry heaving into the flower bed, when Uncle Joe's pickup truck pulls into the driveway.

"Jesus, kid, you okay?" he calls out, slamming the truck door.

I wipe my mouth with the back of my hand and try to stand up straight. "Yeah, just... got overheated, I think."

He walks over, and I realize the leg is still sitting there on the driveway. But when I glance down, there's nothing there.

"You look like hell," Uncle Joe says, squinting at me. "When's the last time you ate something?"

I can't remember. My mouth tastes like old pennies.

"I'm fine," I lie. "Just need some water."

We head into my parents' kitchen, and I grab a bottle of water for me and a bottle of beer for him.

As I'm cooling off in the kitchen, forcing myself to drink the water, I ask him about the house we were working on.

"Hey," I say, trying to keep my voice steady. "That place up on Broke Neck Ridge... What's the deal with it?"

"That job?" he says. "Yeah, it's a real son-of-a-bitch. One of those that looks easy at first, but turns out to be weird iron."

Uncle Joe isn't superstitious. He doesn't believe in ghosts or demons or the supernatural. But he does have this thing about houses.

When he says a house has "weird iron," what he means is that the place fights you. Things keep breaking. Repairs don't stick. Nothing goes right. It's like trying to patch a sinking boat with duct tape. You fix two things, and three more fall apart. The best you can hope for is to make it look decent and flip it fast.

I want to tell him about the scarab. About what just happened. But every time I try to form the words, my throat closes up. Like something is blocking them.

"The previous owner," I manage to croak out. "What happened to him?"

Uncle Joe leans against the counter, scratching his grizzled chin. "Guy just disappeared. Packed up in the middle of the night and left the house with food still in the fridge and a half-empty laundry basket by the door. Didn't tell his neighbors. Didn't leave a forwarding address. The bank repossessed the place, and I picked it up at auction."

He pauses, studying my face. "You sure you're okay? You look green around the gills."

"I'm fine," I say again, but my voice cracks.

Uncle Joe stays for another twenty minutes, but I can barely focus on what he's saying. I keep touching my throat, convinced I can feel something moving around in there. When he finally leaves, I lock the door behind him and lean against it, breathing hard.

That's when I notice the scarab isn't in my pocket anymore.

I tear my parents' house apart looking for it. I check every drawer, every cabinet, every couch cushion. I'm getting desperate when I finally find it.

It's sitting on the kitchen counter, right where Uncle Joe had been leaning, and all six legs are still attached.

I check the time and realize my parents will be back soon. I leave before they show up. This is not something I can explain to them.

I clutch the scarab in my sweaty palm as I drive home, and I swear I can feel it getting warmer. The metallic taste in my mouth is getting stronger. Every few minutes, I have to pull over and spit, convinced something else is trying to crawl up my throat.

I don't know what I brought home. I don't know what it wants.

But I'm done pretending this is something I can ignore. I'm not waiting until the weekend.

I'm going to find out who lived in that house before the bank took it. If there's a paper trail, I'll follow it. If there are news clippings, I'll dig them up. There has to be something. A record. A reason. Anything.

I get the feeling that if I don't figure this out soon, something even worse is coming.

My throat won't stop moving, and I'm starting to think it's not me [doing it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lumedf/there_was_a_strange_beetle_hidden_in_the_desk_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
