I was fifteen when my mother first taught me how to anchor a dream.  
Not control it. Not lucid dreaming. She said it was more delicate than that.  
“It’s like holding on to a memory,” she told me. “You have to build it exactly. Every detail. So, it doesn’t fade.”

She wanted me to create a dream—and keep dreaming it.

MORNING.  
Warm light filtering through the kitchen curtains.  
The soft, distant sound of the kettle whistling.  
A faint burnt toast smell.  
A ceramic bowl filled with cereal and milk.  
No spoons on the table.  
Three coffee cups by the sink.  
One dirty plate on the dish rack.  
Two clocks on the wall—both showing 6:48AM.

I sit at the table.  
My mother stands at the stove, her back to me.

“You overfilled the kettle again,” she says.  
“It boils the same either way,” I answer.  
She places two cups on the table.  
“Not everything works the same just because you want it to.”

Then I wake up.  
Every night. Exactly the same.

I memorized it like scripture and told my mom every detail.  
She began recreating the scene in real life.  
Woke up at 6:00AM.  
Put out three coffee cups. One dirty plate. Burnt the toast. Bought a ceramic bowl.  
She even asked me to fill the kettle and recited the dialogue.

“You overfilled the kettle again.”  
“It boils the same either way.”  
“Not everything works the same just because you want it to.”

She only said the lines once. But the rest—every morning—became ritual.

She had her own nightly ritual too.  
Late at night, she went out to the porch in a faded green dress.  
Six colored candles.  
She'd light them on the stairs.  
Smoke half a cigarette. Then a whole one. Then go back inside to sleep.

She did this every night since I was born.  
Until she was diagnosed with lung cancer.

After she stopped doing her ritual, she got worse fast.  
Her eyes turned bloodshot.  
Her skin looked like dry, cracked clay.  
She started whispering to herself, always in another room.  
She wouldn’t let me visit her in the hospital.  
She just said:  
“Keep the dream alive. Do the ritual. Don’t forget it.”

So, I did.

And it worked—until the night she died.

Then the dream began to change.

The morning light—too bright. Cold.  
The kettle screamed like metal being torn.  
Burnt toast smell—still there.  
Same clocks, same plate, same cups.  
But she was already watching me when I sat down.  
Not blinking. Not smiling.

“You overfilled the kettle again.”  
“It boils the same either way.”  
She places two cups.

“Not everything works the same just because you want it to.”

Her arms moved like frames missing between moments.  
Her blinking made an audible clicking sound.  
I woke up drenched in sweat.

I redid the ritual—every step.  
But the dream stayed wrong.

A year passed.  
And it changed again.

No morning light.  
Just buzzing darkness—like a broken fluorescent bulb about to burst.

The kettle boiled from somewhere inside the walls.  
Burnt toast turned into the stench of charcoal.

I sat at the table. The wood was wet.  
My mother’s shape moved in an endless loop—from the stove to sink and back.

“You overfilled the kettle again.”  
“It boils the same either way.”

Two cups this time. One was cracked. Leaking something thick and black.

“Not everything works the same just because you want it to.”

Then she turned to me.  
Eyes glowing red. Face all dried up and cracked.  
Her mouth opened wide—too wide.  
The voice didn’t come from her.

It came from inside my ears.

I tried fixing it.  
I placed her photo on the kitchen counter—the one from a few days before she died.  
Lit the same six candles.  
Smelled just like her when she hugged me at night.  
I spoke the lines out loud.

And I dreamed.

No kitchen.  
Just a chair.  
I was tied to it.

A kettle screamed behind me.  
I couldn’t move.

Footsteps.

My mother entered. Her head twitched, but her face stayed still.

She leaned in. Whispered:  
“You overfilled the kettle again.”

I couldn’t reply. My mouth wouldn’t open.  
She said it again. And again. And again.

Until it turned into something else.

“You ruined it. You ruined it.”  
“You were not supposed to forget.”

Then she peeled her face off.

Nothing underneath.  
Just glass.  
And behind the glass—my reflection.

I woke up screaming.

That was the last time I tried fixing it.

I smashed the clocks.  
Threw out the bowl.  
Didn’t burn the toast.  
Stopped the ritual.

But the dream still came.

And it got worse.

The kitchen is full of people.  
They’re all wearing her green dress.

The room is filled with the smell of candles

Their faces twitch and melt—like something trying to remember how people are shaped.

They all turn toward me, perfectly in sync.

“You overfilled the kettle again.”  
“You overfilled the kettle again.”  
“You overfilled the kettle again.”  
“You failed her.”  
“You failed yourself.”  
“You let her go.”

The cups shatter in their hands.  
The table splits.  
A face pushes up from the grain of the wood.

It’s mine.  
Eyes red, skin dried.

And the voice now isn’t hers.  
It’s mine.

“You forgot her.”  
“You never remembered her.”

I haven’t slept for three days.

But I know what waits when I do.

That kitchen.  
That table.  
That version of her.

Watching something I love fall apart.  
Again. And again.  
Because I couldn’t remember it right.

Like she said:  
“Not everything works the same just because you want it to.”
