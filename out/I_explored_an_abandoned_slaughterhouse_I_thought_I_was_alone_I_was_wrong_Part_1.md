Ever since I was a little kid I enjoyed spooky stories. I don't really know why. It started with your typical urban legends told in hushed tones when the end of october was near.

As I got older, and had less friends, I started spending more time alone. I think it wasn't entirely normal for a child aged 10 to be awake at 2 AM watching horror shows, but my single mother didn't care, anyways. I used to watch anything from the more child friendly Courage the Cowardly Dog, to the slightly more spooky shows about exploring abandoned places and finding "real" ghosts.

&#x200B;

Surprisingly for my age, I always knew everything I saw wasn't real. I never believed in ghosts. But I watched all of those shows anyways. There's something about the feeling of terror that captured my curiosity as a kid. I'm talking about terror, though. Not horror.

&#x200B;

Horror is what you feel when the pack of ravenous wolves is sprinting towards you with drooling mouths. It is what you feel when the monster is in front of you, and there is no doubt in your mind it will do something awful to you if your fight or flight instinct doesn't save you. You could argue that horror is also what you feel when someone scares you, or there is a jumpscare in the movie you're watching, despite it lasting for just an instant.

&#x200B;

Terror, on the other hand is different. It is a sense of dread you feel despite the lack of a murder monster lunging itself at you with pure hatred. It's what you feel when you think you could be in danger, but aren't sure where the danger is coming from. Sometimes, you don't even know where your terror comes from, and that makes it even worse. One moment you're just thirsty and the next, you feel like someone's watching you from the open door of the bathroom, at the other end of the hallway. Did you leave the door open? Why is it darker there than in the hall. Wait, now that you turned your head towards the bathroom you think you saw someone standing in the living room, looking at you, from the periphery of your vision, while you were turning around. Or was it just a pile of clothes on a chair?

&#x200B;

Terror is created solely by your mind. It exists in our minds to protect us. You see, when our ancestors saw a tiger in the tall grass and there was nothing there, feeling terror was actually helpful. Because, if they just ignored that feeling because it wasn't strong enough, there might just be a real tiger, waiting for the right moment to pounce.

&#x200B;

That's exactly why, when simply watching a movie, listening to a podcast, or reading a story, terror is always stronger than horror. Yeah, okay, the soundtrack suddenly getting loud, and the camera shaking while a monster growls like a mad demon can startle you and make your heart beat faster for a few seconds.

But terror. It can last even after you finished watching or reading.

&#x200B;

Countless times I was scared pissless after watching the show, to the point I used to run to my room, turn the light on, go back to the living room where the TV was, turn it and the light off, while the light in my room was on and the door open, protecting me, then run back to my room, turn the light off and dive into on my bed, covering me in the protective layer of my blanket.

And during the entire process, the sensation of being watched from behind, or from the dark places where I couldn't see slowly creeping on me, intensifying with every moment of silence.

That's the power of terror.

&#x200B;

Once watching these shows didn't have the same effect on me, and I finally got a computer, I started reading creepypasta. A lot of them.

Some were scarier than others, but a small number of them caused something more other than terror in me. Curiosity.

&#x200B;

The ones about urban exploration. There was something about them that made them different. More real. I mean yeah, a tall skinny guy with superpowers stalking you is creepy, but I don't really have any forest nearby, and have no good reason to visit the ones further away, let alone at night.

&#x200B;

But there were multiple abandoned places in my city. Some were surrounded by inhabited buildings, just waiting for someone to go inside and discover its secrets.

&#x200B;

It wasn't long until I joined a group of randos who were doing urban exploration.

It started off really lame, honestly. Most of them didn't really wanna visit the good spots. And the few who did go visit more interesting places were either idiots, or cosplayers wanting to take pictures. Why did I say idiots? Because apparently they either don't understand that going to these places is tresspassing, or don't give a fuck about being caught by the police. Which we got caught, multiple times, thanks to them. Luckily, I was very polite, and good at lying, the few of us that were better at lying always put on a surprised face, and said something along the lines of "But, officer, we didn't know it was illegal to enter! We only wanted to take a few pictures." while pointing at the cameras the cosplayers had. Bullshit. We all -most-, knew it was illegal.

They always just went like "Alright. I won't fine you, but you have to leave immediately.", after which we left for a while, turned around and went back.

&#x200B;

In the beginning, it was so boring I almost regretted ever attempting to do urban exploration. How I wish that regret kept me from going further.

At first all we saw was graffiti, and a little bit of rubble.

But as the group started visiting more distant and obscure locations, and the group shrank, things got increasingly interesting.

&#x200B;

We visited an abandoned hospital that didn't manage to get fully built for one reason or another. Some parts didn't even have walls, only floor and some pillars for support. Other places almost looked completed. Those were the darkest and coldest spots in the entire building.

Some of the walls and floors collapsed, and sealed one of the lower sections of the hospital. From one of the holes on the floor, you could peer down into the abyss. It was so deep you couldn't see the bottom, but I was sure as hell there was a basement down there,

&#x200B;

One day I couldn't visit the hospital with them, but they went anyway. That day they found a crawlspace beneath the rubble and debris, and on the other side, a damp, dark basement. These guys were not the most stealthy because when they all crawled to the other side they found lit candles arranged in a circle, and some strange symbols on the ground, but whoever lit those candles either left, or hid from them.

Just my luck. When things were finally getting interesting I had to be sick and couldn't go. Great.

At least that's what I thought back then when I still had...no. Focus.

&#x200B;

The thing is that, after a couple more incursions that didn't yield any more adrenaline, this group fell apart. It doesn't matter why. Their drama didn't ever matter to me anyway.

&#x200B;

After that, I still didn't have enough. This was the closest I ever got to any real adventure, and I was still forced to watch it from a screen, because I was sick that day.

I couldn't stop now. Not after being so close. So of course I did what any self respecting teenager with a taste for terror and risk would and I assembled another group to explore with.

We were; Mark, a basketball player with a taste for the paranormal. He wanted to explore abandoned places to hopefully one day get evidence of the paranormal. Bob, a short, skinny introvert who was into the occult and wanted to start doing urban exploration with us. Yuhao, a large, muscular dude, Mark's friend, he just wanted to hang out. Bernie, all out thrill seeker that liked to do skydiving and climbing when he wasn't exploring. He wanted us all to explore at night. Hank, the voice of reason. He had a beard an a cool scar on the left side of his forehead. He said the scar was from a wolf attack while he was camping. He still hasn't told us the full story. He was the most responsible of us all. He always brought a first aid kit, a couple of flares, and a taser, just in case.

&#x200B;

With the squad assembled, the veterans knew the perfect location for us, since it was quite close, and it was right at the edge of a small town, next to a restaurant and a factory, so we could get help if anything happened. But they were interested in visiting too, since they heard some really interesting stories about the place.

&#x200B;

It was an abandoned slaughterhouse. Well, not exactly abandoned, anyway, as we would later find out.

The slaughterhouse was comprised of two buildings and a very large field, where all the pigs were once held. The field literally looked like a battlefield. It had walls of sandbags and there were what looked like empty shells all over the place. The veterans told us that the field and the building closest to us were being used to hold airsoft games. That was really cool because they had a shed with mannequins, toy swords, toy batons, toy grenades and fake swat shields made of plastic, so we logically left those in the shed, trying not to get caught by the factory workers.

&#x200B;

That was obviously a lie, we used them and dueled each other for hours!

We spent so long playing with the toys, beating the mannequins, throwing plastic grenades at each other and whacking each other with soft sticks that it got late, quickly. Time flies when you're having fun, eh?

Now we couldn't even explore the first building properly.

But I didnt mind, we had a good time, and we were certain we'd go back to the slaughterhouse soon.

&#x200B;

Next time we visited, we did some real exploration. It wasn't really that interesting. The airsoft guys made sure their playground was safe and clean. No dust, no rubble, nothing. There were no doors, and no windows, sunlight was flooding the entire building and it was HOT that day. The pretend battlefield outside, and the building looked exactly like a Counter Strike map. There were plenty of places to hide in, plenty of ways to ambush people. I did hear some skittering, but I figured it was probably a street dog that was spending the day there and got scared away.

We did find a makeshift bed, tucked away in one of the most remote corners of the building. It was obvious some homeless guy was sleeping there at night. The bed was "hidden" behind a wooden railing covered in a mosaic of torn fabric of all colors.

Luckily, there was no one there.

&#x200B;

The real fun began when we explored the second building.

The pretend battlefield ended at the far wall of the first building. There was a fence separating the battlefield from the other building. 

"There must be another way" said Yuhao.

"Let's try to find a door in the first building" Bernie replied, "Surely there is a way to reach the other building."

&#x200B;

We had to walk through what looked like the place where they killed the pigs. The floor was slightly inclined, and at the center of the room was what looked like a drain, leading to a small canal that looked like it was built to guide the blood to the outside, towards the second building.

And at the far end of the room, the back door.

&#x200B;

Bob remarked that "This place reeks of spectral energy.", to which Mark quickly responded "I hope we see a ghost today."

&#x200B;

When we entered the first building through the main door, it was incredibly hot and sunny, and the memories of playing with the shields and swords the other day almost made us forget that this place used to be a slaughterhouse. But when we went out through the back it was as if the sun was hiding from us. It also got significantly cooler.

The ground was covered in debris. There was an abandoned pick up truck, paint long fallen off, only a rusted carcass without tires left of it. It was loaded with plastic canisters, the stickers indicating their contents where probably disintegrated by rain a long time ago.

It was unreal. It was like they were two different properties, with two different owners and maintainers.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, and without warning, Bernie started to play with one of the canisters as if it was a soccer ball.

"Jesus, man, we don't know what was, or even is in those canisters! Be a little more careful." Hank scolded Bernie.

"What? Afraid of a little acid, or some lubricant staining your jacket?" replied Bernie.

"Naw man, just don't go around touching everything you see before making sure it's safe."

&#x200B;

All of us had to work together to push the cold metal door open. Why did a slaughterhouse have 4 inch thick metal doors? The stark contrast between this and the other building hit us in the face like hammer. It was dark. Way darker than the previous building. Did it even have windows? I can't recall. It was also incredibly cool, despite the heat of the roaring sun outside. There was a weird smell in the air. At the time I couldn't identify it. To me, it smelled like a mix of char, chemicals, and weirdly enough, lavender.

&#x200B;

None of us seemed to mind the temperature, in fact, I'm sure most of us liked it. We all turned on our flashlights and went inside. Fuck. We were so dumb. If only we knew what we were walking into.

The deeper we went, the darker it got. As soon as we entered, we stopped scaring each other for fun. It was actually a little bit more intimidating than we expected.

When we reached the main hallway, it was pitch black. We were all pointing our flashlights down the hallway, trying to see what was inside. 

&#x200B;

I had to go inside first. I obviously had to. Not only that, I was so brave and so great I went with my flashlight off. I don't even know what I was trying to prove. When the rest of the guys started following me into the hallway, I sped up a little. Wouldn't want some company in the pitch black darkness of an abandoned slaughterhouse huh?

And of course, when I saw a door in the middle of the hallway, the first, lonely door, after a long walk through the hallway, I had to go inside. Alone. No one even saw me go in there. At the other side of the door were stairs leading up, and a bathroom.

&#x200B;

The bathroom was really boring. It was stripped of sinks and mirrors long ago, and only had one toilet left.

I admit it, I pissed in the toilet. Shameless? Maybe a bit.

Then I went up the stairs. While I was going up, I remembered the stories the veterans heard about this place. It used to be owned by some rich man, who was suspected of being a member of a satanic cult. He supposedly slaughtered humans too, in honor of Satan. Apparently, the man went insane after discovering that the local authorities were going to investigate his property. He burned down the place, and then went missing.

Bullshit. The slaughterhouse was standing alright. No signs of ever being burned.

&#x200B;

While I was absorbed by my thoughts, I realised how incredibly cold it got. I even had to put my jacket back on just to not start shivering. It was also deathly silent.

And then, as I reached the second floor it hit me. The ground, the walls, probably even the ceiling if I could see it. Everything was charred. Everything was covered by a sheet of black substance, similar to burned skin. And the smell. It thickened so much I had to start breathing through my mouth just to escape the pungent smell of ash and lavender.

To this day I have no idea why I didn't just turn around and look for the others. No, I had to be the brave guy who went alone in the dark, of course.

&#x200B;

Alright, so that part of the story was true. Or at least there was a fire, at some point. And since the building is made of concrete and metal, with hardly any flammable materials anywhere, the fire didn't cover the entire building or destroy it.

So on I went, deeper into the dark. It was even darker now that the concrete walls were covered in black char.

I found another thick metal door that was left ajar, so luckily I didn't have to push it and get my hands dirty to check what was on the other side.

&#x200B;

When I wiggled my way inside, the cold became really hard to endure. It was apparently a refrigeration room. Probably where they kept the...pigs...after they were slaughtered. The fact that one part of the story was true didn't mean it was all true. People make things up all the time. I didn't manage to go too far into the char covered refrigeration room before I heard it.

&#x200B;

God, that sound. It still haunts me to this day. It was a mix between the gurgling croak of a raven, and human laughter. It was jarring, loud, and sudden. I really wasn't prepared for that. Anything but that.

&#x200B;

I still have no idea where I got all my courage from that day, but my adrenaline kicked in real fast, and my instinct was to act natural, as if I didn't hear anything and as if I wasn't interested in that room anymore. I got out of the refrigeration room the same way I got in, then I started walking, only slightly faster than before, towards where I thought I came from.

I couldn't let whatever made that sound know I was scared, or even acknowledge it. I had to remain calm and act as if I didn't even know it was there.

Oh but it knew I heard. It definitely knew.

&#x200B;

The terror really got to me despite my best efforts to hide it, since I clearly wasn't going exactly the way I came from. Instead, after going down **some** stairs, I reached one of the only rooms with a wooden door. The room had a large metal sign with the "Hazardous materials" symbol on it. The one that looked like three intertwined curves with the tips sticking out. Look, I'm no expert. You know what symbol that is.

Again, my stupid primate brain had to investigate, instead of bolting the fuck out of there. The room was full of empty plastic canisters, all with the same symbol on them, as well as the skull and the little flame symbol, which I think means "flammable materials". The canisters had strange chemical names I didn't even know, and were all empty. What did I walk into? Was I going to get intoxicated for being in that room?

&#x200B;

But I couldn't stop and think, I remembered what I was running from. I managed to get back to the hallway, from a different door entirely. I could only see Mark there. The relief I felt was enormous.

Still walking only a little faster than usual, I went towards him and said "Hi.", I then made a gesture for him to follow me, and we went to the other side of the hallway, where there was anothe metal door to the outside.

There, I finally got the courage to acknowledge what just happened. I told all of them what I heard, I told them about the char, and the weird chemicals. I then said the sound was probably just a bird, that got there to hide from the heat of the sun, and my mind only exaggerated the sound.

&#x200B;

Wishful thinking that was. But still, Hank and Mark decided to follow me back there, see for themselves. When we arrived there, the char was still there, the empty canisters of strange, toxic chemicals were still there. But in the refrigeration room there was nothing. Nothing at all. We searched every corner. Which wasn't hard since the room was completely empty, save for one ligth that was hanging from a cable from the ceiling, and was really close to the ground.

&#x200B;

After we confirmed there was nothing there, we decided to go back down, but from a different direction.

Since I was secretly desperate to get out of there, I was in the front. It made me feel safe knowing the boys were behind my back. The fact that the char on the walls was beginning to fade was also really good.

&#x200B;

But of course, my lucky day wasn't over just yet. Of course not. I couldn't help but notice there was another big door, or rather, doorway this time. The metal door was resting on the concrete wall next to the doorway, which was crudely blocked by a few wooden planks and a barrel.

To me, it was obvious someone placed them there to purposedly make it look like the entrance was locked, but the planks were really light and easy to move, and the barrel was empty.

On the other side, was a huge, empty room. Well, empty, except for the chair in the middle. Oh, and the circle of candles all around the chair, forming a pentagram like shape. There were also multiple glyph like marks on the ground. Great, this part of the story was also true.

At least this time the candles weren't lit, like when the previous group found them in the hospital basement.

&#x200B;

I quickly called the other two guys, who followed me inside, where the smell of lavender impregnated everything. I wasn't prepared for what awaited me in the middle. On the chair, and on the ground around the chair, was a small pool of blood. Not like, a few drops, or maybe a handful of large stains of blood.

No.

One. Single. Pool.

One pool of blood that was still red and fresh, as if whoever or whatever bled on that chair did so not too long ago.

That was it. After this, we gathered everyone and left immediately.

&#x200B;

After that day I learned an important urban exploration lesson. Don't go anywhere alone. Even if there turns out to be no danger there, you'll save yourself a lot of fear and anxiety.

&#x200B;

Oh how I wish this was the end of it. I wish this was the only, or at least the worst story I had to share. But my great luck didn't end there, oh no. I'll post again soon.
