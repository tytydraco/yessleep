They say schools are places of safety, of learning, of community. Black Hollow Elementary didn’t feel like any of those things. It felt forgotten, felt like something everyone agreed to abandon but never spoke about again. But I needed the work. Usually, a substitute teacher doesn’t ask too many questions. But I should’ve.

The day I arrived at the campus, the parking lot was empty except for a few faded lines. The building rose before me, a boxy relic of brick and grime. The wooden sign out front was cracked and splintered, the school’s name barely legible beneath the peeling paint. A faint smell of ash hung in the air.

After stepping out of my car, I checked the email again, hoping I’d gotten the address wrong. No such luck. That was the place, and as far as I could tell, I was the only one there. No lights, no movement. The silence pressed in, thick and unnatural, until the front door groaned open on its own.

I froze.

For a moment, the building just stared back at me, its darkened doorway inviting.

It felt as if a deep breath pushed me forward. The tile inside was dull and uneven, my footsteps echoing down the long, empty hall. Dim, flickering lights cast uneven shadows on the lockers lining the walls. Some were dented and scratched.

The smell of ash followed me inside, intensifying with every step forward. It stuck to the back of my throat, and I tried to push down my discomfort. The hallway stretched ahead, longer than it had looked from outside. The air felt thicker, dense enough to make my chest tighten.

Down the hall, a figure appeared. A man in a gray uniform shuffled toward me, his face lined with deep creases, his expression a little too friendly. He nodded as he passed me and gestured to the left. The gesture felt... odd.

I followed his direction and found myself in front of a door marked Twelve. The number had been carved into a wooden plaque above the frame. The handle was cold under my touch, unfitting against the hall’s warm, stale air.

The moment the door swung open, the ash smell hit me like a wave, stronger than before. The room itself was silent. Rows of perfectly aligned desks filled the space. And in those desks sat the students. The way they were sitting, though, upright, rubbed me wrong. Their faces also turned toward me at the exact same time. Saying I got goose bumps right then and there is an understatement.

Their eyes were what struck me the most. They were... waiting … perhaps for something important. Watching. Every pair of eyes locked onto mine, unblinking.

The chalkboard at the front of the room was clean, except for a name written in perfect cursive: Ms. Harper. My name.

As unease rose in my chest, I stepped farther into the room. The door shut softly behind me, though I didn’t turn to see who—or what—had closed it.

I stood at the front of the classroom, staring back at the rows of catatonic children. Not a single one shifted in their seat or glanced away.

I placed my bag on the worn surface as I greeted them. The wood was nicked and scratched, the edges splintered, as though it had been dragged across a floor. When I glanced up, their eyes stayed fixed on me.

My pulse quickened as I turned to the chalkboard. The lesson plan was already written in precise white letters, as if they’d been printed there instead of drawn.

I hesitated before speaking again. The silence was so absolute that breaking it felt wrong, like stepping into a forbidden place. My voice came out steadier than I expected. I introduced myself and gestured toward the board.

The children didn’t move, not even to nod. They just kept staring. The only sound in the room came from the buzzing fluorescent lights, flickering faintly, their glow casting uneven shadows that seemed to ripple along the walls.

I walked between the rows of desks, trying to appear casual. Their skin had an odd pallor, not quite unhealthy but lacking the vibrancy you’d expect in kids.

One girl near the back had a faint sheen on her bloodied hands. She was fiddling with a locket on a chain hanging from her neck. Completely disturbed, I asked her why her hands were bloody, but, as expected, she didn't answer. My eyes lingered on her locket for a moment before I moved toward the front of the room. The floor creaked beneath me, and for an instant, I could’ve sworn I heard a second creak that didn’t match my steps. I stopped and glanced behind me, but the children hadn’t moved. Their eyes were still locked on me.

The clock on the wall ticked unevenly, its hands stuttering forward in jerky movements. The minute hand skipped before settling back into place, though I could’ve sworn it wasn’t working at all when I first walked in. Time seemed strange here, stretched and heavy.

After assessing the room, I strode back to the chalkboard and picked up a piece of chalk. The weight of it was oddly unfamiliar in my hand, but I wrote the first problem from the lesson plan, though the numbers blurred slightly as I focused on them. My mind struggled to hold onto the shapes, as if they resisted being written.

Behind me, a chair shifted. It was faint, but in the silence, it felt deafening. I turned quickly, my heart pounding, but all the children were still in their seats. The girl with the locket was the only one who seemed different. Her lips were slightly parted, her head tilted just enough to look unnatural.

My breath hitched, but I forced myself to move. The floor creaked louder beneath my steps as I walked toward her desk again. Her eyes didn’t follow me this time, but they stayed wide, as though they were fixed on something far away. Her hands were trembling faintly, the sheen of moisture glistening like a thin layer of dew.

The air felt heavier around her desk, and my chest tightened. But I just stepped back and returned to the front of the room, trying to ignore the burning sensation at the back of my neck, the feeling of eyes pressing into me.

I faced the board again, staring at the lesson plan written in perfect cursive. The last line on the board—one I hadn’t noticed before—caught my attention.

“They will listen if you keep to the rules.”

The words blurred as I blinked, and when I looked again, they were gone.

The bell rang, sharp and mechanical. Its shrill sound jolted me, though none of the children flinched. They stiffly rose from their desks in perfect unison.

I stayed by the desk, watching as they filed out of the room without a word. Their footsteps echoed down the hall, fading into the distance until everything was silent again.

I waited a moment, gripping the edge of the desk, before I slung the bag over my shoulder and walked to the door.

The hallway stretched out in front of me. A cold draft seeped through the air, even though the windows were closed. I tried to shake off the unease building in my chest as I made my way toward the main doors.

When I reached them, I pushed hard against the metal bar, expecting the door to swing open with ease.

It didn’t move.

I tried again, putting more weight into it, but the door refused to budge. I stepped back and stared at it. Then panic clawed at the edges of my mind.

I turned and walked briskly down the hall, looking for another exit. The windows lining the corridor caught my attention, their panes smeared with grime and streaked with pale smudges. I pressed my fingers against the glass, but it didn’t move. Not even a rattle. It was as though the windows had been sealed shut long ago.

The sound of a distant creak stopped me in my tracks. It came from somewhere behind me, low and groaning, like the shifting of an old wooden floor. My eyes darted to the classroom doors on either side of the hall. The faint scent of ash hung in the air again, stronger than before, sharp and bitter. It clung to the back of my throat, making it hard to swallow.

I forced myself to keep moving, and the soles of my shoes scuffed against the cracked tile. The sound echoed back at me. When I reached the stairwell at the end of the hall, I glanced down. The stairs disappeared into a darkness so absolute it seemed to swallow the faint light spilling from above. A chill ran through me, but I turned and climbed up instead, hoping to find another way out on the second floor.

The upper hallway was dimmer, yet the lights were flickering erratically. The lockers in it looked older. Deep scratches gouged into the metal doors marked some of them.

I kept walking, passing closed classroom doors and rows of lockers, each step pulling me farther into the silence.

I tried another door marked Exit, shoving my shoulder into it with more force. It didn’t move. The handle was cold and smooth, refusing to turn, no matter how hard I tried. I stepped back and looked around, scanning the hallway for any sign of movement. Nothing stirred, but the oppressive silence proved impossible to believe I was alone.

A faint scrape echoed behind me. I turned sharply, my eyes darting to the far end of the hallway. There was nothing there, just the long stretch of flickering light and shadow. My pulse quickened, and I started walking again, my pace faster, my footsteps blending with the strange echoes that seemed to trail behind me.

The next door I tried was locked, too. I rattled the handle harder than before, the metal biting into my palm. A loud creak broke the silence again, this time closer, and I froze. The sound lingered before fading into nothing. My hand slipped from the door handle, and I stepped back, my heart pounding.

I glanced over my shoulder, my eyes scanning the hallway. The shadows seemed deeper, the spaces between the flickering lights stretching longer than they should. The smell of ash thickened, filling my lungs with every breath. The cold draft brushed against the back of my neck.

I turned back toward the stairwell, but my path was blocked. The figure of the janitor stood there, his face obscured by the dim light. He just stood there, motionless.

Neither of us moved. My breath caught in my throat, and I gripped the strap of my bag tightly, the edges of the fabric digging into my hand. The lights flickered again, plunging the hallway into brief darkness. When they came back on, the janitor was gone.

I didn’t wait. I turned and headed for the stairs leading down, ignoring the darkness pooling at their base.

Every step echoed louder than the last, as though the sound itself wanted to catch up with me. The air felt as if filling my lungs like smoke. A door on my right stood ajar. Its faded plaque above it read Staff Lounge.

I stepped inside. The room was dim and stale, its walls stained with watermarks that stretched like reaching hands. A stack of papers was spread on the table.

I sifted through them, my fingers brushing against their brittle surface. Attendance sheets. Each name was familiar, the same children I’d seen in my classroom. The date at the top was from decades ago, and every name bore the same grim mark: deceased.

A corkboard hung near the back wall, its surface covered in old photographs. My stomach tightened as I recognized the children again, their faces blurred and featureless, their outlines smudged like a bad memory. One photo caught my eye—a woman stood at the front of the classroom, her expression stern, her name scrawled at the bottom: Ms. Turner.

Behind me, the floor creaked. I whipped around, but the room was empty. Papers on the table shifted slightly, though there was no breeze, and a faint ripple spread across the surface of the corkboard. I stepped back toward the door, but something held me in place—a weight I couldn’t see but could feel everywhere.

A dark stain began to spread across the ceiling, its edges jagged and uneven. It dripped slowly, black and thick, pooling on the floor below. My chest tightened as the room darkened, the corners swallowed by shadows that twisted and moved on their own. That’s when I stumbled out of the room.

The hallway led to a door I didn’t remember seeing before. Papers were strewn across the floor, their edges burned and blackened.

I knelt to pick one up. The ink was faded, but I could make out the names—more attendance sheets, all with the same grim word stamped beside them: deceased. The dates stretched back decades, repeating the same children’s names again and again. My stomach churned as I scanned the list. It didn’t make sense.

I turned toward the far corner, where a single notebook lay on the floor. Its leather cover was charred at the edges, and its pages crackled faintly as I opened it. The first entry was neat, bearing a name I had seen before, Ms. Turner. Her handwriting grew more frantic as the pages went on, describing the children, the fire, and the way the school seemed to twist around her. The last page was a single, jagged line: The school won’t let me leave.

I stumbled out of the room and back into the hallway, my breath catching with every step. The walls around me pulsed faintly, and the acrid odor pressed against my lungs. I kept moving, though I didn’t know where I was going. I only knew I couldn’t stop.

The hallway twisted, and each step forward brought me deeper into a maze that wasn’t there before. The air grew heavier, pressing against my chest like it wanted to squeeze the breath out of me.

The notebook weighed heavily in my hand. The leather was cool and slick, almost wet, though there was no moisture. Its pages whispered faintly as I moved. Every corner I turned revealed more of the same: endless rows of lockers, doors that wouldn’t open, and windows that didn’t seem real anymore. The ash smell had thickened, coating my tongue with its bitter tang. I wiped my mouth on my sleeve, but the taste lingered.

I pressed forward, drawn by a pull I couldn’t understand. The notebook had become something more than an object. It felt alive, the heat of it radiating into my palm as if it knew what was waiting for me. The shadows in the corners of the hallway seemed to stretch and move, though I never saw them shift directly. They lingered just out of view, hinting at shapes that didn’t belong in this world.

The floor beneath me groaned, the sound low and uneven, like a great weight pushed against it from below. A draft slid past me, carrying the faintest echo of a whisper. I stopped and turned, but the hallway behind me was empty.

A sharp crack broke the silence, splitting the air like a whip. I froze, my grip on the notebook tightening. A line snaked its way across the ceiling as its jagged edges glowed orange. The sound boomed as another crack branched out from the first. The ceiling trembled above me, small fragments of plaster raining down as the cracks widened and spread.

As my footsteps pounded against tile, the hallway stretched farther with each step. No matter how fast I moved, the end of the corridor always remained just out of reach. The lights overhead flickered faster, their buzzing growing louder until it became a high-pitched whine.

The ground beneath me shuddered, and I stumbled, catching myself against a row of lockers. The metal was warm, and I jerked my hand away. The surface of the lockers rippled, the warped metal shifting as though something inside was pushing against it. The shadows at the edges of the hallway surged forward, swallowing the light and leaving me in near-darkness.

I forced myself to move, dragging my feet forward even as the ground seemed to fight against me. The air grew colder, biting into my skin with every breath, and the smoky air was so thick it burned my throat. The hallway around me groaned like a living thing, the walls pulsating with a faint, irregular rhythm.

Ahead, a doorway appeared, its frame glowing faintly in the darkness. It shouldn’t have been there before, since I had passed that very hallway earlier. The glow pulsed, drawing me closer, despite the dread clawing at my stomach. The notebook grew hotter in my hand, its weight pulling me forward even as my legs resisted.

I stepped through the doorway and found myself in a room unlike any I’d seen before. The walls were lined with mirrors, their surfaces dull and warped, reflecting faint, distorted images of the hall behind me. The air in the room was cold, colder than anywhere else in the school, and each breath left a faint mist hanging in the air.

At the center of the room stood an old, scarred desk. A single chair sat behind it, its wooden frame splintered and worn. The light in the room came from no visible source, casting long shadows across the floor that seemed to shift and crawl on their own.

The notebook grew heavier, and I set it down on the desk. The moment it left my grip, the pages began to flutter. The faint sound of the paper rustling filled the room, growing louder and sharper until it became an unbearable screech. The mirrors on the walls rippled like water.

One by one, the mirrors darkened, their faint reflections swallowed by blackness. The screeching stopped abruptly, replaced by a deep, rhythmic thudding that echoed through the room. It sounded like a slow, deliberate heartbeat, each pulse shaking the floor beneath me.

The desk trembled, the notebook shifting on its surface as though trying to move. The scratches on the desk glowed faintly, their jagged edges forming words I couldn’t read. The mirrors around me brightened.

Flames danced in the reflections, their edges flickering wildly as shadows moved within them. Shapes twisted and writhed in the fire, their outlines impossible to define.

I turned toward the doorway, but it was gone. The walls had closed in behind me, leaving no escape. The mirrors reflected nothing but the fire, their surfaces alive with heat and motion. The heartbeat grew louder, shaking the room with each pulse, and the shadows in the flames began to move toward me.

The notebook snapped shut on the desk, which echoed like a gunshot. The fire in the mirrors flared brighter, and the shadows within surged forward, spilling out into the room. Gasping, I stumbled back, my chest tightening as the heat washed over me. The last thing I saw before the darkness swallowed me was the reflection of my own face in the glass, staring back at me with someone else’s eyes.

The room vanished, replaced by darkness so dense it seemed to cling my skin. I reached out, searching for walls, a door, anything solid, but my hands met only emptiness. The air carried the faintest smell of char, mixed with something damp and rotting, and each breath felt like inhaling smoke. I couldn’t see the mirrors anymore, but their presence lingered, as if they were still watching, hidden just beyond the darkness.

The spongy ground beneath me shifted. Every step squelched faintly, and I stopped moving. A light appeared ahead, flickering like a dying bulb. It barely illuminated the space around it, but it was enough to pull me forward.

The light hung over a small desk, identical to the one I’d left behind. It was battered and scarred, with deep scratches running across its surface. The notebook was there, placed neatly in the center, as though it had never moved. Next to it, the locket I had thought lost rested in perfect stillness, its surface glinting faintly in the dim glow. The sight of it sent a cold wave of recognition through me, its significance somehow heavier.

I stepped closer, my shoes sinking in with each step. The ground felt wrong, like damp earth mixed with something thicker. The desk seemed farther away than it should have been, but I reached it eventually. My fingers brushed the locket’s surface first, and a faint warmth radiated through my skin. It was the warmth of something alive, something watching.

The scratches on the desk shifted and writhed into words as I tried to read them, but one word stood out clearly: Choose. My chest tightened, and I pulled my hand back from the locket. The glow from the letters pulsed, matching the faint, rhythmic thud I could hear in the distance.

Behind the desk, a shape emerged from the darkness. It wasn’t a person, not entirely. Its outline shifted constantly, like smoke trying to hold a solid form. Its presence made the air colder, and I couldn’t breathe deeply without choking on the thick air. The shape leaned forward slightly, though it had no face to speak of, and a voice came from everywhere at once.

The words were in my head, clear and sharp, cutting through my thoughts. They told me I had a choice to make, though no details followed. The notebook glowed faintly on the desk, the light above flickering faster and casting erratic shadows across the space. The locket around my neck, however, was different. It pulsed faintly, almost in rhythm with the voice, as if it was alive and tied to the decision I was being forced to make.

I opened the notebook again, though my hands trembled. The pages were blank except for the last one. The writing was faint but legible, and the letters were carved into the paper instead of written. They repeated the same word: Stay. The voice in my head grew louder, repeating the same command, layering over itself until it became a roar.

My hands gripped the edge of the desk, nails digging into the wood. The word carved into the desk pulsed again. The ground beneath me shifted, and I realized I wasn’t standing on earth anymore. It was something alive, something breathing, its rhythm matching the thudding heartbeat in the distance.

I tried to step back, but the ground held me in place, gripping my feet with an unseen force. The light above grew brighter, almost blinding, and the voice in my head quieted for a moment. The silence was worse than the noise. It felt purposeful, as though it was waiting for me to act.

My locket seemed to hum, drawing my gaze. I reached for it, though I didn’t want to. My fingers trembled as they touched its surface, and the warmth spread through my hand like fire. The voice returned, louder this time, demanding I choose. My chest tightened, and the ash smell grew so thick I thought I might suffocate.

When I opened the notebook again, the words on the final page had changed. They were sharper, more deliberate, cutting through the paper like scars: Sacrifice. Escape. Stay. The locket pulsed against my palm, and I opened it, fighting back tears as I gazed at the picture of my mother inside its heart-shaped frame. The choices were simple, but the weight behind them pressed against me like a physical force. The voice in my head whispered the options, slower, as if savoring them.

The glow from the desk grew stronger, and the scratches on its surface formed a new word: Choose. The notebook pulsed in my hands, its heat unbearable, but I couldn’t let go. The ground beneath me trembled, the breathing sound louder, more erratic. The shape in the darkness leaned closer, its presence overwhelming, and I knew whatever choice I made would change everything.

The light above flickered one last time before going out completely. The darkness swallowed me, and the voice roared in my head, louder than before, demanding a decision. My hands gripped the notebook tighter, the locket still burning in my palm, and the words on the page burned themselves into my mind, leaving no room for thought.

I had to choose.

The ground beneath me shifted, forcing me closer to the desk, and my body acted on its own, driven by a force I couldn’t resist.

The mirrors on the walls flickered to life again. Flames danced on the other side, their edges sharp and wild, casting shadows that twisted unnaturally. Shapes moved within the fire—distorted figures that writhed and clawed at the air. One by one, small figures turned toward me, their faces void of features.

A new shape emerged in the flames, more solid than the others. It was on its knees, hunched forward, and its movements were slow, deliberate. My chest tightened as I recognized the form.

Her. My mother.

Her face wasn’t right. The features were familiar but warped, like a reflection in broken glass. Her eyes burned and were empty, dark holes that drew in the light around them. Her mouth moved silently, and though no sound escaped, the voice in my head grew louder. The words were hers, though twisted and wrong, layered with the same unnatural tone from before.

The locket burned against my skin, its heat radiating up my arm, and I couldn’t tear my gaze away from her. She stared back at me from every fragment of the mirrors, each image more distorted than the last. The flames grew brighter, licking at the edges of the glass, and the heat in the room became unbearable. I wanted to run, but the ground held me in place, pulling me deeper into its grasp.

The voice in my head shifted, its tone colder, demanding. It offered me the choice again: Sacrifice. Escape. Stay. The words echoed, filling every corner of my mind until I couldn’t think of anything else. My gaze dropped to the desk, where the notebook sat, motionless, its pages blackened and smoking.

Involuntarily, I reached for the notebook. My hands trembled, and my chest tightened as I lifted the cover. The page was empty except for one word, burned deep into the paper: Stay. The locket in my other hand pulsed violently, and I dropped to my knees, its heat searing into my skin. My vision blurred, and for a moment, I thought I might collapse.

The mirrors shattered. The sound was louder than anything I’d ever experienced, but it came with no relief. The fire spilled into the room from the mirrors’ surfaces, consuming everything in its path, and circled the desk instead.

The locket glowed brighter, its surface splitting open, spilling ash onto the scorched ground. Inside wasn’t the picture of my mother anymore—it was a reflection of my own face, warped and hollow. The sight of it made my chest tighten as the ground beneath me surged. My mother’s image appeared in the flames again, her face twisting into something unrecognizable, her dark eyes boring into mine.

The voice in my head spoke one last time, its tone final and unyielding: You belong here.

The fire surged forward, engulfing me entirely. My body didn’t burn, but the heat consumed everything else. The locket disintegrated in my hand, its ashes swirling in the air before disappearing completely. My mind fractured, breaking apart piece by piece, until nothing remained but the voice. It was everywhere, surrounding me, filling every thought, every breath.

Flames flared all around the room, encircling the desk. With my feet planted on her charred, spongy remains, I was stuck, helpless, watching my mother burn and scream in never-ending [misery](https://youtu.be/E9l02HlC3gE?si=cUKG7jHxvsZwvKQY).
