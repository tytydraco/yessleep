After my daughter april passed my husband killed himself and i was devastated so Me and my other  daughter may, moved into this house like a week ago and I was still not done unpacking. I moved into my mother's old home that she lived in before her passing.she died after having a heart attack in and I found her in the basement,her hair was never found she was completely bald even shaved!  I was unpacking things in the kitchen when she runs in red faced and grinning. "Mummy,MUMMY!" She shouts. "What do you want princess mummy is a little busy." "Me and my new best friend want some snacks please!" I was very confused "darling we just moved in and you've not even started school yet how do you have a friend already?" "She was outside on a pretty pink bike and she let me have a go!" My heart froze "darling what did she look like?" She had sandy blonde hair and blue eyes!" My brain shut down and with a shaking hand i reached into the cupboard and got the special chocolates reserved for special occasions.

"Mummy why did you give me the special chocolates?" "You have a friend over. It's a special occasion" she skipped away happily. I can't belive what's happening. She can't find out what happend to the other one. "Mummy?" I jump "yes princess did you enjoy the chocolates?" "What chocolates? I came to ask who you were talking to?" A voice shouts from upstairs "MAY I GOT SOME COOL CHOCOLATES!" "Oh that's my friend June she looks exactly like me!" She runs upstairs

 "I stop and enter the basement. "Time to make another." I groan as I pick up the chemicals ignoring the choking sounds coming from upstairs. I hum the months song as the choking stops and I mix the dna from my mother's hair with mine. A year later me and my daughter August moved into another house with a large basement she's not aloud to go in there and is annoyed about it but she behaves just like the other ones but she's got twin best friends that look exactly like her and I'm running out of special chocolates I'll have to get some more from my dad. He makes them after all there called special chocolates they taste really good but the side affect is a heart attack come to think of it no one knows where my dad was when mother died. I'll have to ask him. When I pick them up but the thing is August hates chocolates for some reason if those twins did anything or said anything I swear.
