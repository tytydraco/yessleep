When I was eight, I asked my grandfather what happened to his arm.

It wasn’t meant to be rude. I was just a curious kid, and he was one of those larger-than-life adults who seemed carved out of stone. My grandpa didn’t talk much, but when he did, everyone listened—especially my mom. He had this heavy presence, like even when he wasn’t speaking, the room adjusted to him.

That day, we were at his old farmhouse in upstate Pennsylvania. I remember the creak of the floorboards and the way the air smelled faintly of old wood and pipe smoke. My mom was folding laundry on the couch while Grandpa sat in his recliner, his half-empty sleeve pinned neatly to his shoulder. 

I’d seen it a hundred times before, but something about that afternoon made me stare longer than usual. The skin where the sleeve ended was pale and puckered, wrapped in a thick bandage that looked freshly changed.

So I asked.

“Grandpa, what happened to your arm?”

The room went quiet. The kind of quiet that presses in on your ears. My mom froze, the shirt she was folding slipping out of her hands. She gave me this look—half panic, half anger—and started apologizing right away.

“Dad, I told him not to—”

“It’s alright,” Grandpa interrupted, waving her off with his good hand. “He should know what the world does to people.”

He leaned forward in his chair, the old leather groaning beneath him. The light from the window hit his face in a way that made his eyes look pale and glassy, like the color was draining out of them.

“It was an accident,” he said slowly. “A bad one. My arm got caught in the blast when our truck went up. The heat was so strong it cooked the flesh before I even felt the pain.”

He chuckled softly, but there was no humor in it. “Smelled like burnt pork,” he added.

My mom flinched. “Dad, please—”

But he wasn’t done. His voice grew lower, heavier. “They told me the bone showed through,” he said, staring past me. “But I remember more than that. I remember seeing it still there, reaching up through the fire. Still trying to grab hold of me. Like it didn’t understand it wasn’t part of me anymore.”

My mom grabbed my arm so hard it hurt. “Enough,” she snapped.

He blinked, as if just realizing where he was. His mouth twitched into something like a smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes.

“You don’t have to protect him, sweetheart,” he said to her. “He asked, and he deserves the truth.”

“The truth?” she hissed. “That’s not the truth. You know it isn’t.”

I remember her voice cracking when she said it. I didn’t understand what she meant, and I wouldn’t for a long time.

She yanked me toward the hallway, muttering something about getting me a snack, but I kept looking back at him. Grandpa’s gaze followed me the whole way out. He was breathing hard, like he’d run a mile just sitting there.

And then, just before Mom closed the door, he said something I’ll never forget.

“You don’t walk away from something like that,” he murmured. “Not all of you.”

That was the last time I saw him for years.

Mom stopped taking me to his house after that. When I asked why, she said, “He’s not well.” If I pressed, she’d just say, “You don’t understand what he’s been through.”

But there were things I did understand. I understood that his house smelled wrong, like metal and mold even with the windows open. I understood that his bandages were never clean for long, even though he changed them every morning. And once, when I snuck down the hall late at night, I saw him through the crack in the door, sitting up in bed, whispering to the empty sleeve of his shirt.

He was rocking slightly, his shoulders trembling, and the bandages on his stump were moving.

It wasn’t much—just a small twitch, like something underneath was trying to stretch. But I saw it. I know I did.

When I told my mom, she popped me on the wrist for lying.

Now I’m seventeen, and Grandpa’s coming to stay with us for Thanksgiving. Mom says it’s because he’s old and can’t live on his own anymore, but I don’t believe her. She’s been pacing around for weeks, cleaning the guest room over and over again, checking the locks, jumping at every sound.

And last night, when I passed by her room, I heard her crying. She was whispering something over and over through the door, the same three words:

“He shouldn’t’ve lived.”

That’s when I realized—I don’t think my grandpa lost his arm. I think something took it.



Grandpa arrived two days before Thanksgiving.

I heard his car before I saw it—a sputtering old Crown Victoria that coughed its way up our gravel driveway like it barely remembered how to move. I was watching from my bedroom window when it came to a stop, the engine idling unevenly before going still. The world seemed to pause with it. Even the trees outside, which had been swaying in the cold wind, stood oddly still for a moment, like they were waiting.

Mom went out to greet him. I stayed upstairs at first, pretending I wasn’t curious. She hugged him tightly, but something about the embrace looked off—more duty than affection. When she pulled back, she kept glancing toward the sleeve of his coat, like she was afraid it would move.

When he finally came inside, I caught my first glimpse of him in years. He looked smaller, thinner, like someone had drained the color out of him. His skin was a strange grayish tone, and there were new bandages wrapped higher up than before, almost to the shoulder. He wore a heavy jacket even though the house was warm.

“Hey, kiddo,” he said, smiling just enough to show his teeth. “You’ve grown.”

His voice was rougher than I remembered, and I noticed the faint smell that came with him—like rust and antiseptic, but underneath that, something sweet, almost rotting.

Dinner that night was awkward. Mom tried to make small talk, asking about the drive and whether he’d been taking his medication. He barely responded, his eyes drifting toward his left side every few minutes. Once, I thought I saw his jacket sleeve shift, a subtle movement, like something inside had pressed against the fabric.

Mom noticed too. Her fork froze midair, her knuckles white.

“Dad,” she said quietly. “Are you… okay?”

He looked up slowly. “Fine,” he said. “Just tired.”

But later that night, I woke up to a noise.

It was soft at first—just a faint tapping from the hallway. I thought it might be the house settling, but it was too steady. Tap. Pause. Tap. Tap. Pause. Like a pattern. I lay still, holding my breath, and realized it was coming from the guest room.

From Grandpa’s room.

I crept to my door and pressed my ear against it. The tapping continued, followed by the low murmur of a voice. I couldn’t make out the words, but the tone was wrong—too quiet, too strained, like he was speaking through his teeth.

Then came a sound that froze me in place: a faint scratch, followed by another tap. Something dragging against wood.

I opened my door just enough to see the hallway. The guest room door was half open, the light inside flickering. I could see the edge of his bed and his silhouette sitting on the edge of it.

He was talking to his arm.

I didn’t see his face, but I could see his shoulder moving. The empty sleeve was hanging there—except it wasn’t hanging. It was twitching, rising slightly off his leg like something was pulling from inside it. His breathing was ragged, almost like a growl.

I was too scared to move. I watched for maybe five seconds, maybe ten—it felt like an hour. Then, suddenly, the light went out.

He turned his head toward the doorway.

I didn’t wait to see more. I slammed my door shut and threw myself into bed, pretending to be asleep. I could hear him in the hall a few minutes later—slow, dragging footsteps. He stopped outside my room for a long time.

I could hear him breathing.

Then he whispered, “You saw, didn’t you?”

The next morning, Mom said he’d had a “rough night” and told me not to mention it. But I couldn’t stop staring at his left sleeve over breakfast. It looked heavier somehow. Like something was inside it again.

And when he smiled at me across the table, his fork held awkwardly in his one hand, I swear I heard something faint—metal scraping against bone—from inside that arm-shaped void beneath the fabric.
