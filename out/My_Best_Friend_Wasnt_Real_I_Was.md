I swear to God I didn’t know.

I didn’t know I was the *imaginary* one.

Okay, let me start from the beginning. I’ve always had trouble fitting in. Ever since grade school. It wasn’t like people *hated* me — they just didn’t… notice me. Like I wasn’t even there.

That all changed when I met Ezra.

Ezra was the first person who actually *talked* to me like I mattered. I met him in 6th grade, sitting under the bleachers during recess, sketching this creepy drawing of a house with a hundred windows and no doors.

He looked up at me and said, “You ever feel like you’re only real when someone’s looking at you?”

That messed with me. Because yeah, I *did* feel like that sometimes. I sat next to him, and we just… clicked.

From that day on, we were inseparable. We didn’t hang with anyone else. We passed notes in class with weird riddles and “if you die in a dream do you die in real life” type stuff. We spent every afternoon at the abandoned train tracks behind my school, where we built this hideout from scrap wood and old sheets and called it “The Crooked House.” We swore that if one of us ever disappeared, the other had to come there and wait until midnight. Like some blood pact.

I told my mom about Ezra a few times but she’d just go, “Oh, your imaginary friend again?” Like she was joking. She even said, “You’ll grow out of him eventually.”

I laughed, but it made my stomach drop a little.

Years passed. Ezra never changed.

Like, literally never. We hit high school, and I got taller, deeper voice, acne. Ezra? Same as he looked in sixth grade. Pale skin, shaggy hair, black hoodie even in the summer. I asked him about it once and he just said, “Don’t you get it? I’m not like you.”

I thought he meant, like, metaphorically. Emo stuff.

Then things got… weird.

I started noticing how nobody *ever* talked to Ezra. Not even teachers. Even when he raised his hand in class, they’d call on someone else. At lunch, he sat with me and no one said anything — but when I left my tray there once and came back, there was *only one tray*.

I asked a classmate, “Hey, did you see where Ezra went?”

And they said, “Who?”

I thought it was a joke. But it kept happening. And then, I checked the yearbook.

**Ezra wasn’t in it.**

Not in 6th grade. Not in 7th. Not even in the attendance records when I snuck into the admin office.

I confronted him at The Crooked House. I was shaking, holding this crumpled attendance sheet with his name *not* on it.

He just smiled and said, “I told you I wasn’t like you.”

I screamed at him. I said he was fake, that I made him up, that maybe I was going crazy.

Then he said something that made my blood freeze.

**“No, I made** ***you*** **up.”**

I laughed. Like, genuinely laughed. Because that was so dumb. I’m the one with a mom, and homework, and grades and all that. Ezra’s the weird hoodie kid that no one notices.

Then he pulled something out of his pocket.

A notebook.

**My notebook.**

I recognized the black cover and the duct tape on the spine. Except… I’d lost it in 7th grade.

He opened it and flipped through pages and pages of entries. Each one… was about me.

>“Subject #17 still unaware of his fabricated origin.”  
“His emotional responses continue to improve.”  
“He now exhibits paranoia — self-awareness emerging.”  
“Termination likely approaching.”

>I felt my knees buckle.

I told him to stop. To shut up. But he kept reading.

>“If Subject #17 continues to question the narrative, he may become unstable. Emergency failsafe authorized.”

He looked up at me.

“Sorry,” he said. “But I have to shut you down now.”

I ran.

I sprinted through the woods behind the tracks, sobbing. I didn’t stop until I reached my house.

But something was wrong.

The house was empty. Cold. Dust on everything. Like it hadn’t been lived in for years.

There were **no pictures of me** on the walls.

Only Ezra.

As a baby. As a kid. Blowing out birthday candles. Holding a dog I didn’t recognize. A school portrait with the same hoodie.

That’s when I saw the photo on the fridge. Ezra and a woman I’d never seen before — and written on it in Sharpie was:

>“Ezra and Mom — 2021”

**My mom?**

I stumbled to the bathroom. Looked in the mirror.

I didn’t have a reflection.

I swear to you, I didn’t.

I was never real.

Ezra made me.

I was some kind of… *program*. A mental experiment. Maybe a dream. Maybe something worse. He made me to feel *less alone*. A friend that could never leave. One that believed he was real.

And now I’m slipping.

I can feel myself *fading*. Every time I blink, it’s like the world skips forward a second. My memories are blurring. My hands feel transparent.

I don’t know how much longer I have.

But if you’re reading this… if this post stays up…

**It means I haven’t disappeared yet.**

Please.

Come to the Crooked House behind Greenfield High. Midnight. If someone’s there…

**Tell them I was real.**  
Even if I never existed.
