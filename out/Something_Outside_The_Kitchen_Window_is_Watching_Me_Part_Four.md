\- - -

We stared at the blank screen for what felt like forever, letting the quiet permeate again. The room felt stuffy, awkward, and grey—an uncomfortable concoction of stillness and dread. I stayed silent, my gaze captured by the phantom lights dancing in my vision—the afterimages burned into my eyes from the video abruptly ending.

*"We have to find her,"* Cindy uttered, her eyes glazing as it never left focus on the black mirror before us.

Cindy and I began delving into who she was, searching for any trace of her online*—*social media sites, webpages, blog articles*—*anything Cindy and I could access. We only had her name and face, but it was enough.

Finding her social media profile within less than 10 minutes was slightly unsettling. Finding information about this woman within a few clicks and taps on the keyboard was a jarring thought. Anyone could be traced and searched for easily in this day and age, and I felt anxious to think deeper about it—what if it would happen to me, and not for good reasons?

As Cindy scrolled through Tina's page, she uttered to herself, being glad the woman was still alive*—*living a happy and peaceful life. She owned a market stall at the farmers market, at a beach in North Carolina. Photos of her with a young girl and an older woman were prevalent, in multiple photos throughout the years, as the three were the ones that mostly appeared on her gallery page.

I felt a sense of melancholy as Cindy persistently scrolled through Tina's profile. *"Do we have to bother this woman? I mean looking at her now, she's moved on. She seems to be happy and living a peaceful life, away from... all of this."* I bit my lip feeling the hesitance in my voice, though my hesitation wasn't enough to deter me from speaking out what I thought.

It felt wrong to suddenly come into this woman's life, barge into her space asking questions that had brought her and her family pain decades ago. Especially if they truly had moved on from the past—from the tragedy.

*"It's not a matter of 'if' anymore, Josh. We have to do this, we have to get answers, to proceed and be one step closer to the truth."* She said coldly, with no weariness or hesitation for what she was about to part-take in—ripping off a bandage from the families of the victims, opening up old wounds for the sake of uncovering the truth, but what's to expect from someone that's been obsessed with this case for over a year.

She truly was a journalist—a relentless one at that.

I made no arguments, I relented and let her take the wheel, even if it felt heavy on the inside—even if I didn't want to follow her lead, because deep down I knew she was right, we didn't have any other leads to follow, no other hints or evidence to track down within our grasp—this was our only hope.

My thoughts were ended by the ringing on my phone.

*"Mom."* It read on the screen, my phone pulled out from the inside of my pocket.

I made a slight gesture as Cindy briefly glanced at me with a nod, pivoting my feet to the other room as I took the call.

*"Mom?"* I uttered, accepting the call.

*"Joshua, sweetheart. How are things there, are you getting ready for the family Christmas?"* She asked a hopeful tone in her voice, sensible even at the other end of the line.

I couldn't bear a response just yet as I froze, I had completely forgotten about the family gathering they had planned, it was going to take place in a few days, and I only had a day or two to pack up and prepare if I wanted to make it on-time.

*"Y-Yeah, I've been... Christmas shopping. Gotta get you and the others something for Christmas right?"* I stammered in my words, maybe I wasn't the best liar, I rarely would get away with lying, especially with my mother, it's like she just knew, whether from the tone of my voice or how my body reacted while speaking to her—she just did.

*"That's perfect! Although you didn't have to, we're just hoping you make it, as we're all going to be here during Christmas, you know?"*

Her voice sounded cheerful, genuinely—or so I think it is.

She made small talk and continued talking about the plans for the faithful day, it sounded great on paper. Everyone gathered from their respective lives, from different parts of the country, or world, visiting our childhood home just for this one faithful event.

What should be filled with love, peace, and prosperity, a time for joy and family, but as my mother continued to gush about the plans and how great it was all going to be, my eyes trailed to the dark window, staring at myself—my reflection, and the dark outline of 506's kitchen window.

It was around this month when they had passed, they too probably had plans for their own Christmas celebration, being able to spend time with each other, basking in the love and joy. Maybe even seeing all their other relatives under one roof, all the children gathered, playing around while the adults caught up in long familial conversations.

But, they didn't get to have that, they weren't given a chance to. As my eyes trailed into the darkness, my grip on my phone tightened. In a trance-like state, I felt my attention be pulled back once again, with the sound of my mother calling out to me at the other line.

*"Yeah, I'm still here Mom... It's been a long day, I just... dozed off a little bit."* I mumbled, wanting to at least make it sound more convincing. She chuckled lightly, apologizing for keeping me up this late at night, and we exchanged goodnights' before ultimately hanging up.

I yawned realizing that for once I was genuinely tired, wanting nothing but to go to bed.

*"We leave tomorrow at 9 for North Carolina,"* Cindy spoke walking to me from the living room to the kitchen.

I simply let out an exhausted breath from my nose, with a shrug I walked past her grabbing my bag to put it back into my room.

*"I hope this works, I hope that making someone re-live a past trauma is worth all of this."*

*"I don't... want to do this. But we have to."* Cindy breathed out, a slight tinge of guilt present in her tone before staying quiet, gathering her things to leave. *"Josh, when was the last time you had your gas checked?"* She asked out of the blue.

*"Not recently, why?"*

*"Nothing, it's just... I thought I smelled something near your kitchen."* She furrowed her brows, her bag in her hand as she stood by the doorway, pausing to think to herself.

*"Ah, I don't know. It's probably just the vents, I had Mr. Grant come in and fix my A/C earlier. I can't tell what smells anywhere at this point since my nose probably got used to it all."* I reasoned, chuckling slightly as she held a solemn smile while nodding.

We said our goodnights and parted ways, her leaving my apartment, and I locking the door safely, before retreating to my room.

I understood the complexity of our situation, she held more bravery than I, in terms of making the tough calls, but the feeling of guilt, it's not just something I could brush past with the thought of doing things for the 'greater good', who are we to decide that for anyone.

Though the decision swayed from my morals, I relented—am I a coward for doing so?

I packed up lightly, it was just a short day trip, and I estimated we'd be back around nighttime, leaving at nine in the morning. I carried the stuff I prepared with me inside my backpack like a Boy Scout; my granola bar, two bottles of water, a mini first-aid kit, and a bag of trail mix.

Of course, my keys and wallet were somewhere along there, probably in the front or back pocket. With preparation being said and done, I left my apartment.

My eyes met the door of Mr. Jobert's from across the hall, the number '501' blaring at me, feeling the familiar guilt creep back in once more at the back of my neck. I tried to brush it off, looking away abruptly with a sigh stifled between my lungs and my throat, as I got into the elevator to wait down at the lobby for Cindy.

It was morning, usually I'd expect Mr. Grant down at the lobby making phone calls or scheduling repairs he had to do, but he wasn't anywhere to be seen. Chalking it up to the man probably somewhere in the building arranging repairs for other tenants, I walked around the lobby patiently waiting.

Cindy arrived not too long after, we got in my car which wasn't parked too far from the apartment, and after prompting up a GPS location map with the farmers market down in North Carolina, we finally began our journey.

The drive was quiet at first, I could tell we both had one thing in our minds at that moment. *"What do we say,"* I uttered, thinking out loud as the words slipped from my mouth and my gaze was focused solely on the road.

*"The truth, what we're there for."* Cindy was blatant, her eyes never leaving the passenger seat window as she watched the trees pass by, the morning sunlight peeking through the branches and leaves before gently beaming on her skin.

*"Okay... and if she doesn't—"*

*"She will. She has to."* Cindy cut me off, not even letting a sliver of doubt emit from my lips.

There was a brief awkward silence, I knew it would be a 4-hour drive from where we were to the beachside farmers' market in North Carolina. I tried to make small talk, asking about how Mr. Jobert was doing, what he was like as a Father, and how Cindy felt in general, growing up with him as her Father.

*"Honestly, he's not that different from then, and now. He was protective of me and Mom, but it grew worse when she passed. In the first few months, I couldn't go anywhere without him giving me a curfew, or him checking on me by calling every 30 minutes."* Cindy said with a sigh. I chuckled finding Mr. Jobert's overprotectiveness to be endearing, although I could see why she would feel suffocated by that.

*"I love him, I do. Although lately, he hasn't been himself. More reserved, quiet, and... not there. I don't know, have you noticed it?"* She turned the question to me, meanwhile, I gave her a brief side glance with my hands on the steering wheel, and I shrugged.

*"Love the guy too, but... I'm not keeping up with his daily life closely like that to know, it'd be a little weird if I did, don't you think?"* I quipped as she chuckled, a genuine smile I don't think I've ever seen from her just yet.

*"What, not into older men?"* She teased as I felt myself choke on my spit.

*"Oh calm down, I'm just messing with you. I know you see him as a father figure of some sort. Speaking of... what's your family like? I've never seen them around."* Cindy's attention was fully on me as mine was on the road, I let out a soft breath before shrugging slightly out of nervousness, I don't think I've ever opened up about my family in a long time.

*"Well... I grew up on the West Coast, my folks are situated somewhere in rural California. They were always on the go, making a living for me and my adopted siblings. My mother is barren so they settled for adoption, and you never see them since they never come here. Apart from my mother about a year ago, dropping by to leave a cross above my bedroom door."* I blurted out, recalling information about my past, though not enough to overshare, remembering I've had troubles with that more times than I'd like to admit.

*"That's odd, why don't they visit?"* Cindy uttered, I gave her a brief glance just to see her expression, I could sense the sympathy in her eyes, I felt the odd feeling of being pitied, and I didn't like that.

*"I wish I knew. I've had a relatively good relationship with them... At least I think so, they're the only family I know."* I said, a solemn tone in my voice as I felt a slight melancholy permeating with family being the subject of our conversation.

*"What about your biological parents, did they ever say anything about them?"* She asked.

I shook my head, I wasn't sure whether or not they had, and I just don't remember. I knew that I was adopted as a baby in an orphanage, while my parents were on a waiting list, hoping to adopt a newborn or a toddler, that's how I, and many of my siblings came to be under one roof.

Cindy didn't press further, even though she knew her boundaries despite being the nosy one between us two. We sat in a comfortable silence for a while, watching the beautiful scenery before us, as we neared crossing state lines. My stomach growled as I looked down briefly before feeling a slight fluster emit at the back of my neck.

*"Sorry, I skipped breakfast. I have a granola bar in my bag, would you mind if—"*

*"Just stop at the diner at the next gas station we get to."* She cut me off, refusing to hand me my granola bar inside my bag, just laying waste in the backseat of the car.

*"I'm not gonna eat there, I'm saving up, I don't wanna waste money eating pancakes or food I could just make at home."* I reasoned, and before I could talk about having to pay for my car, and other bills and expenses, she cut me off.

*"Well you didn't, so I'm buying."* She said.

I glanced at her, trying to see if she was serious about doing so. *"What? Don't tell me you're turning down free food over fragile masculinity."* She quipped, half-jokingly as she chuckled at her own words.

*"Oh no, please do. Just don't start complaining when I order the most expensive thing on the menu."* I had a sly grin as I began to direct the car to the furthest lane, preparing to pull over when we reached the diner. *"Enjoy the freezer-burn diner steak then."* She rebutted as I slightly winced at the thought.

Frozen, and slightly moldy steak was not something I wanted to consume first thing in the morning, especially on a long drive to get to our destination.

When we got to the diner, we had a fun time together. Though, it's probably something I wouldn't say out loud. We sat together and had playful banter about what to get, while I spent a good amount of time considering whether or not to make things harder for her, since she made us stop at some diner in the middle of the road.

In the end, I settled with a breakfast plate, and she had a stack of pancakes with artificially flavored strawberry syrup. It felt nice being able to get to know more about Cindy, I'd come to find out she does go to the same university as I did, except our schedules just never interloped, or I was just too focused on myself to actually notice whether or not she was around.

She spoke about her deadlines and complained about how pursuing an old case set her back from her academics.

*"I know nobody is holding a gun to my head, and that I'm doing all of this with my own volition. But deep inside of me, I know I want to finish what my mother started."* She said, picking on her food as I stayed quiet, eating quietly.

*"I know how badly this case affected her throughout the years leading up to her death, I know they made my Mother some sort of target because she was digging too deep in the case."* She continued.

*"Although the worst they've done, as far as I know, was to have authorities take the evidence she held against the Drovers—but that's exactly why I have to finish this. I have to know what she held against them, what my father refuses to talk about. The man would lose his mind if he found out I'm pursuing this case."*

Cindy chuckled solemnly, a melancholic tone behind her slight grin as her eyes focused on the window. I made no effort to break the silence, letting her sit in her thoughts as she processed her own words, I had nothing to say anyway. Once more I knew I just had to sit and be a listening ear for her, to be there for her.

We left after paying for our meal, and we got back to the car, letting a generic pop song play on the radio to break the silence. We exchanged short conversations afterward, making gas station stops to use the bathroom or to get some snacks to pick on while we were out on the road.

Time had passed, as the once cold morning turned into a chilly afternoon. We arrived at the farmers market a short while after making the cross to North Carolina.

Sniffling, from where we stood beside the parked car. The beach was almost completely enveloped with snow, the waves rolled lazily, tamed by the winter's unrelenting blanket of cold. The beach looked eerie, the unorthodox combination of sand usually associated with summer and heat was overwhelmed by the frothy white snow.

Cindy clutched her scarf, covering half of her face further, seemingly to avoid the cold winter air blowing on her face. We began our walk, navigating to get to the farmers market as we followed the footprints of various other shoes, permeating all over the parking area as it led further away from the beach, and towards the dock, where various other shops were lined facing the ocean.

We walked through the docks until we saw from a distance the familiar roofs of market stalls, similar to the ones we'd seen in the photos we found. Most of the vendors were bundled up, hands wrapped in gloves as they hawked their goods to the handful of shoppers willing to brave through the cold.

*"Winter Sale! We have all the fruits and vegetables you need for your Christmas dinner!"* A vendor spoke out as Cindy and I walked by, I gave them a smile and a nod while she persisted, walking while looking around for a familiar face.

A few more vendors spoke out about their promotions and sales, while we walked scanning various booths, as well as their products. *"It takes a lot to sell and work during this season, struggling in the cold, waiting out here for hours, just to make a sale,"* Cindy uttered, gazing at the sparse crowd. I nodded but didn't respond further, my eyes scanning the small booths lined with mason jars, packaged baked goods, and woolen scarves.

We wandered for a while, out of habit rather than any real intent to buy, I felt a little bad just brushing off the vendors so I gave them gestures and greetings, rather than icing them out in the cold weather.

*"You know, you don't have to do that to every person we come across right?"* Cindy quipped.

*"I know, I just... want to."* I shrugged, as she let out a brief chuckle.

We continued down the stalls until she paused, her eyes glazing over as her focus was on the woman draped in a blue sweater, her white scarf covering half of her face. She was occupied arranging the fruit baskets out on display, while a younger girl beside her draped similarly fixed the vegetables in an organized manner.

*"Tina?"* Cindy spoke out to her, catching both of their attention as my eyes slightly widened.

She's going for it? Not even bothering to lay the groundwork gently, just diving headfirst into re-opening this woman's old wounds?

*"That's me."* The woman in blue spoke, revealing more of her face to us as she had a concerned expression on her face. I can understand why she would feel unnerved, having two strangers show up at her place of work wasn't exactly a thing you'd expect daily.

I was about to intervene before Cindy could start asking her questions, but ultimately, the girl was quicker, abruptly speaking before me. *"I heard you have fresh sea grapes, my father has been craving those lately, it's good for his immune system."* Cindy's voice spoke higher than usual, a calm demeanor emitting from her as she approached the stall closer with a gentle smile.

*"Oh- oh yes we do. These usually grow in the summer, so they're hard to come by and cheaper during that season."* Tina's expression shifted to a reciprocating smile as the two conversed, while I stood slightly dumbfounded.

*"I saw on your page that there were sea grapes so I had to come by with my... brother, to come and check it out,"* Cindy gestured toward me, as I gave them an awkward nod and a wave, her expression staying cheerful before looking back.

*"See Mom, I told you we need to put ourselves out there more, it drives more customers."* The younger girl spoke, as Tina and Cindy chuckled at the girl's remark.

I stood giving them smiles and nods, letting Cindy take the wheel as the pair eased into us while preparing the fruit in a brown paper bag. *"I was wondering if we could have a word with you, we're from out of town, and... we just have a few questions if you don't mind?"* She spoke with a slightly faltered look from her once cheerful demeanor, holding a hopeful expression on her face as Tina furrowed her brows in consideration.

*"It's about Josephine. We know what happened to her and her family was not an accident."* Cindy's words had Tina with a widened stare, her face almost turning pale on her already light complexion. She froze for what felt like a minute before she turned to the younger girl beside her who was continuing to organize the fruits and vegetables on a basket.

*"Sarah, I'll leave the store to you. If Abuela calls, just say I had to go on an errand real quick."*

Cindy and I left with Tina, I felt slightly unnerved as we followed the woman, unsure where she was taking us, gesturing for us to keep going. We ended up at a coffee shop nearby, away from the cold weather outside. I sat beside Cindy while Tina sat at the opposite chair, warming her hands on the cup of coffee between her palms, as Cindy and I let her gather her thoughts, having to process and dig up old memories long left decades ago.

*"My name is Cindy, I'm an Investigative Journalist major at Virginia State."*

*"I'm Joshua. I... I live in the apartment next to where Josephine and her family had passed."* I wasn't sure how I was going to introduce myself, but I know just from the look Tina had in her eyes as she looked at me—a look of silent concern, a chill ran down my spine.

*"So you're not siblings...? I figured. You two look nothing alike."* Tina chuckled lightly, as Cindy smiled and I scratched the back of my neck, recalling Cindy's white lie earlier. Tina's eyes were still on me as she observed my features, slightly longer than she did Cindy's.

We sat in the quiet pause before a light breath emitted from the older woman. *"Josephine and her family were good people. We lost them too soon, especially those sweet kids. They had a whole life left to live, Joseph was barely even a few years old, I held that baby when he was just a newborn."* Tina smiled sadly with her eyes focused on the coffee between her palms, focusing her gaze on the steam emitting from the cup.

*"I remember his little hands clinging onto my finger while Hector had to make sure the other kids were okay at home, and Josephine was asleep resting after giving birth,"* Tina said, melancholy evident in her tone as she reminisced a peaceful time, her eyes on me as her emotions were even more evident, getting a better look at her face.

*"It's such a shame we couldn't give him and his siblings a proper burial. The bodies of Andrew, Mila, Jenny, and Joseph were never found. I didn't question it at that time... thinking that the fire practically incinerated those children. That thought haunted me for years, I hope those angels are resting in peace, lord knows they deserve it the most."* I felt a slight prickle in my eyes, hearing and sympathizing with Tina's grievances, she and her mother must've held so much guilt as if they had survived the fire from within the apartment themselves.

*"I've been waiting—praying for years... just for something like this to happen, I felt guilty for the longest time leaving the town, leaving it all behind. But I did try, I tried my hardest, I fought my strongest, but at the end of the day, what more could I have done."* Tina clasped a hand on her mouth, glancing down as her eyes watered brimming with tears.

This was painful to watch, to see someone have to dig up old buried memories, feelings suppressed to move on from the past trauma inflicted by the unfairness brought upon her and her family by the world, by chance, or maybe even by fate.

My mouth parted, unable to sit idly by while the woman teetered between breaking down and holding herself together. *"Please take your time, we don't have to do this today or tomorrow. You can let Cindy and I know when you're ready and—"*

Her hands reached out for mine, holding onto them for composure as she shook her head. "*No. No, I can handle it."* Tina held a look of determination after wiping stray tears off her face.

*"Josephine's story needs to be told, the world needs to know what truly happened to my sister and her family,"* Tina said, as Cindy prepared to record her words with her phone, she asked briefly if it were okay, to which the older woman simply nodded.

*"Weeks before the incident, Josephine had been complaining to me and our mother about the gas leak. Hector tried to fix it himself after the building manager was unresponsive—they said a lot was going on, so they were taking a bit too long to handle the family's apartment repairs."* Tina paused with a distant look.

*"Hector couldn't fix it himself; the parts he needed to replace weren't something you could just pick up at a hardware store. They were foreign and imported, so back then they were harder to come by. It wasn't just a matter of money, although they were living paycheck to paycheck—even outside hires were struggling to find replacements that matched."* Her voice held an agitated tone, undoubtedly frustrated as she seemed to recall previous memories.

*"Josephine begged the manager to send someone, to speed up the process as patching it up with tape wasn't cutting it anymore—but they brushed her off, setting their problems aside."* Tina paused once more as her eyes glazed over, looking at me and then at Cindy.

*"Until it was too late."* Her breath shook, struggling to utter the finality of what had happened to the Gonzales.

*"When we found out their death was being ruled as an accident*—*that the building did not fault the incident, I couldn't stand it. I wanted to rip every single person in that company to pieces, to cause them the same pain they have caused me and my family."* Tina no longer held back her tears.

*"I gathered family members, friends, and community members to protest and speak out the truth, we did everything we could to get the word out, to get people to listen and to spread the truth, yet that company was always one step ahead of us."*

Cindy shifted uncomfortably in her seat, glancing briefly at me with furrowed brows before turning to Tina. *"Do you think Elmwood and law enforcement was covering up their faults?"* She asked trepidation in her expression.

"I'm sure of it. They did it so cleanly too." Tina sardonically chuckled under her breath.

*"A woman that lived in the building told me about the silent repairs Elmwood was making on those faulty gas lines, under the guise of 'general maintenance'. It's good they went ahead to finally fix that damn issue... but at the expense of my family?"*

*"I can never forgive that."*
