“It’s the wrong bloody key.” I exclaimed, yanking it out of the lock.

“Huh?”

“I know! What the fuck?”

“Wait wait. Grandad said they were with Nan didn’t he?” Mike asked. I nodded. He bit his lower lip and thought for a second. “I think I have an idea of what he meant.” He said with a boyish smile.

“Do you mean…” I felt my stomach start to churn. “We go and dig her up?” I stepped back away from him wondering whether the stress had gotten to him and finally broke his psyche.

Mike looked at me bemused before he burst out laughing. “No you lemon, come on.” He beckoned for me to follow him before excitedly bounding up the stairs. I climbed up the stairs after him and switched off the light as we came to the top. He ran up the other set of stairs too. Curiously, I watched him as he led me into Grandad’s bedroom at the end of the hallway.

I decided not to change anything about my Grandad’s bedroom. Just in case he ever moved back in. And because I liked it the way he had it. On his bookshelf sat a few pictures of relatives. A framed photo of me, Mike and our other cousins as children sat right at the top. Then his pictures of own children at varying ages, aside from my piece of shit father, were scattered around the shelf. And so were pictures of his wife. She was a very beautiful woman with light brown curly hair and very blue eyes. I don’t remember her at all since she died when I was just a baby. But when you’re constantly hearing about someone and you’re surrounded by images of them, as well as them making up a quarter of your DNA, it’s easy to feel like you know them. I smiled at her.

Mike gently took the brass key from my hand as he scanned the bookshelf. I wondered if he knew of a secret disguised book I didn’t know about that he was going to unlock. Carefully, he picked up a photograph of my grandmother which sat on top of an old locked wooden jewellery box.

“Oh. I see.” I said in a mock detective voice. Mike tapped the side of his nose.

I felt incredibly stupid for not even thinking about that box. But it was one of those everyday household items you take for granted. They blend into the scenery of the room and become unremarkable. I watched Mike take the box off of the shelf and lay it on Grandad’s bed. Then he put the key into the lock and sure enough we heard a promising click as it opened.

“Ta da.” He said, moving aside for me to open it. I rolled my eyes at him and stepped forward to look at the box.

As I lifted the lid a dulcet tune began to play. And a little mermaid sprung up and began to spin in circles. I recognised the tune but had no idea where it came from.

“Where have I heard that before?” I asked, smiling a little trying to remember whether it was a lullaby or something old and famous.

Mike made a tense expression. “Oh my god….” He mumbled under his breath.

“What?” I turned sharply to look at him.

He put his hands in his pocket and his eyebrows knotted together. “It’s the tune that the monster was humming.” He said.

We both shared a tired and pained expression. I looked back down into the box. It mostly held old pieces of jewelry but as I lifted out the first compartment of the box it revealed another hidden one underneath. There was the set of keys glinting up at us. On the set was a key made of heavy blackened wrought iron. I knew instantly that it belonged to the door. My uncle Kevin, who’s a massive history dork, believes you can feel the history in certain objects. I never really understood what he meant by that until I lifted the iron key out of the box and felt the weight of it in my hand. It felt so cold, colder than the other keys.

In a silence, as heavy as that wrought iron key, Mike and I descended back down into the cellar and walked to the door. My hands began to tremble as I tried to place the key into the lock. I missed it at first. Which Mike usually would’ve found funny but in this case only increased the tension weighing on us both. On my second try I managed to fit the key into the lock, and summoning all my willpower, I turned it. There was a heavy clunk from the lock. The sound made me wince. Then the door swung forward by itself, heavy on its hinges.

Staring both Mike and I in the face was a tunnel carved into the earth. Neither of us could form any words as we stared into the empty blackness. But this didn’t feel cold and empty like the darkness of the cellar. It was earthy and old, a darkness left to rot in the moist underground. It had a smell. Damp. Acrid. I took a step forward, eager to go in, to find answers, to have my theory confirmed. Before I could disappear into the tunnel Mike grabbed my collar and yanked me back.

“Have you gone insane?!” He yelled, his face white with terror.

“What did you see something?” I asked a little too eagerly, looking back over to the tunnel expecting a smile to be waiting for me in the dark.

“No. But look at it! Don’t go in there! You’ve got no idea what’s in there!” He yelled using his arms to articulate, pointing at me and then the tunnel.

“...I do. We’ve seen it.” I pointed out.

Mike narrowed his eyes angrily. “Yeah. Exactly.” He said.

“The tides out.”

“Yeah. But your theory hasn’t been fully tested yet, we don’t know where it goes. So let's be cautious shall we?”

“If we go into the tunnel we can test my theory and know for sure. We pretty much know for certain that the monster is getting in through these tunnels, all we need to know is how it’s getting into them. Because I think the tide is washing the monster into the sewage system or whatever and it's somehow making its way here.” I explained eagerly, hoping I’d win him over with my excellent proposal.

“I’m not going in there and neither are you.” He demanded, his tone cool and stoic. That set me off. I hated how he could be calm and angry at the same time.

“Who put you in charge?” I said snarkily.

“Who put you in charge?!” He roared back.

“Grandad!”

We stood there squaring up to one another, neither one of us daring to make a move or say anything else. Finally, Mike stormed off up the stairs in an agitated huff, leaving me behind in the cellar. He slammed the door to the pub behind him and the silence after the slam gave me goosebumps. Using the adrenaline from our tete a tete still I scurried around the basement grabbing some pieces I thought I might need for my adventure.

Flashlight in hand, small bottle of aged whiskey that I’d swiped off a shelf, in the other, I entered the tunnel.

It didn’t take long before I started crying to myself. I wandered through the dark as I took sips from my bottle. I’m a crier in arguments, always have been. Mike and I had never had a fight before, not a real one. I know our interaction might have seemed very minor but it was truly out of the ordinary for us. We’ve had disagreements of course, we’re cousins. But we handle things differently. When we were kids we were the silent treatment types. I almost couldn’t handle thinking that I’d upset him, it felt so unnatural.

As I continued to walk deeper into the tunnel I realised I had quite a lot to cry about. In the cold darkness of the tunnel I let myself whinge about anything and everything. My emotional spiral kept the fear of the dark and the monster away, I don’t think I would’ve been able to traverse the tunnels with a rational clear head. I kept asking myself unanswerable and stupid questions like, why did dementia take my grandfather so early? Why was I even allowed to take over the pub when I’m twenty one and have zero experience owning a business? Why does no one in my family other than Tanya, Mike and Grandad want to listen to me? I don’t think they ever liked me anyway. And also where the fuck does this tunnel go and how long have I been walking?

I checked my phone which shockingly still had a bit of signal. I’d been down there for about forty minutes, even though it felt like five. The dirt floor had begun to curve downward as I walked. Soon my surroundings changed from dirt, to rocky dirt then finally just jagged grey rock lined the ceiling, walls and floor.

I got over my emotional outburst fairly quickly and as my head began to clear my surroundings began to unnerve me. I soon felt the instinct to turn back and start running as fast as I could. But I quelled that instinct with another sip of whiskey. Which shockingly I hadn’t guzzled and although I was definitely under the influence, I wasn’t drunk. Yet. As I wandered I thought about how long it had been since someone, other than the monster, had walked down this tunnel. I decided I quite liked it. The darkness felt cozy at times, almost like the inside of a closet during a game of hide and seek. It gave me sweeny Todd vibes a little bit, and I could see in my mind's eye a Victorian woman pulling a body that had been washed ashore up this tunnel. Of course the obvious explanation for the tunnel was smuggling. But that just didn’t feel right to me. Couldn’t put my finger on why. That being said I had fun imagining pirates carrying crates of rum and bags of sugar up the tunnel, holding lit torches and candles.

I put my hand on the cold stone wall as if, like Uncle Kevin said, I could feel the history. I kept my hand dragging against the stones as I walked deeper and deeper into the tunnel. Suddenly, I came across a fork in my road. Well it was more of a trident, as the tunnel split off three ways, one straight forward, one to my left and one to my right. The space between them all was beautifully decorated with colorful painted murals. Ancient scenes depicted the creature I had seen in the basement, widely grinning with blueish skin and blackened eyes.

Each tunnel entrance was painted seemingly to tell you what it was. The one to my left was painted like the doorway to the local cathedral. The right was painted like a big beautiful building I didn’t recognise topped with a family crest whose last name began with M. And then in front of me was the face of the monster. The doorway acted as its mouth, wide and ready to consume me. Its eyes sat above, watching and its arms were outstretched ready to receive me. I turned back to take a look at what was on the entrance I came from, and there was a quaint artistic rendition of my pub. I scoffed, turned and continued marching forward.

It was obvious which tunnel I had to follow if I wanted answers. Throwing myself into the metaphorical, or perhaps literal, belly of the beast I entered the monster's mouth. This beast's belly was cold and damp, and smelled salty like the sea. That portion of the tunnel system felt different. The passage was much much wider and I didn’t like that I couldn’t see both walls either side of me at the same time. Also maybe it was just my mind but it felt colder. My hairs began to stand on end. My own breathing echoed on the walls of the rock which had become smoother as I walked on.

When I took a moment to pee in a corner I realised I was face to face with some writing on one of the walls. There was graffiti down here! It’s existence shifted my mood completely and I didn’t feel quite so isolated. There were names. Dates. And to my surprise, prayers, pictures and poems:

“Ivy, age 27 and Charles age 6 were here- 1925”

“Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me- Micheal Marsh 1625.”

“Do not weep my fair bride,

For I am not gone with the tide,

I live on in our son and daughter,

Who I saved from watery slaughter.

J.R 1825.”

“Fucking cunts!!!” No name or year. Personal favourite.

I spent a very long time reading every single piece of graffiti I could. There were some I couldn't make out, especially the ones lower down which were worn from being lapped at by the tide when it came in. And some markings which I think were in different languages.

My reading came to an unwelcome halt when, as I was staring at a stick figure style drawing tracing my hands over it, I felt my feet getting wet. I looked down and saw that the water had begun to gather on the floor beneath me. The tide was coming in.

Gasping, I yanked my hand away from the wall. In my adrenaline fuelled trek I’d forgotten the very reason I was exploring the tunnel. I looked back toward the pub and then out toward what I assumed was the direction of the water.

I decided my best chance was to start running back and pray that I would make it there before the monster did. Otherwise I risked both the monster and the incoming tide.

I turned to run. Then as my foot lifted from the floor I felt something drip onto my forehead. I touched my hand to my forehead and my fingers plunged into a cold slime. My mind raced with a logical explanation. All I could think of was stalactites. But I didn't think there were stalactites in man made tunnels. I already knew what I was going to see. But still, I looked up, my eyes moving from the dark emptiness below to what I prayed was the rock above.

Poised like a spider in the corner of one's bedroom, which you only notice once your head has hit the pillow was him. Directly above me clinging to the low ceiling. He was illuminated by the light of my torch. The grinning sea monster. Eerily still. Eyes closed. He could’ve been mistaken for a statue, were it not for his slow breathing and the moisture which dripped from him onto the rock below.

A shocked yelp escaped my lips. I lifted my hands to catch the sound before it reached the creature. I was too late. Its eyes sprung open. Its blue lips curled into an impossibly wide grin, wider than any it had shown me before. My instincts waited to see how best to react, sticking me to the floor unable to move feeling slime continue to drip onto me.

My instincts finally told me to run when I heard the monster copy my yelp.

I dropped everything I had, other than my flashlight, and started sprinting through the tunnel. My flashlight strobed on the wall as my arm moved up and down with each sprint. I caught glimpses of the creature running on the wall beside me. As I ran, tasting blood in my mouth and feeling my lungs sting, the sea monster imitated its long since slaughtered victims.

“Mother! Help me!” It screamed in a choked childlike voice, mouth not moving. Followed by blood curdling screams of a child in agony. “Dear God! Spare me!” It cried in a woman's gentle voice. “Please don’t leave me here alone! I can see it! It's coming for me!” A man's voice in pure abject terror shook and trembled before joining the chorus of screams.

I felt its hand almost grab me. The wet fingers brushed against my arm feeling moisture behind. Joining the echoes of the fallen, I screamed. Another voice for the creature to imitate.

When I reached the trident in the tunnel I took a turn into the passage that led to somewhere I didn't know. Not the pub or the church. The one with the M. This tunnel was claustrophically narrow and lined with a painful pebble dash. I scraped my arms on the walls as I ran. The monster seemed to have trouble getting through it too. I wonder if that was a design choice.

At the end of the tunnel was a ladder. In desperate disbelief I almost cried like a child. Frenzied, I threw my flash light to the side and leapt onto the ladder. With a speed I didn’t know I was capable of I started clamouring up the rungs.

At the top of the ladder was a trap door which by some miracle wasn't locked. I threw it open the door thudding against the floor above and pulled myself out. I looked down at the monster just seconds behind me. I smacked the trap door onto its wet head and sat on the door, keeping it closed with my body weight. Serendipiously, I realised the key hole was the same as the one on the pub door. I shoved the brass key into the hole and turned it, locking it.

I got up from the trap door and the thing stayed locked. I wondered if I had smacked the monster so hard on its slimy head that it was now laying comatose at the bottom of the ladder.

Then it began to speak again, this time in my fathers voice.

“Not my little girl. Send the weird little one down. That kid’s not right in the head anyway.”

Followed by an imitation of my grandfather's calm tone.

“It's just how things are Charlie.”

“Shut up!” I banged my hand on the trap door. To my surprise the monster was quiet for a moment until it finally said:

“Who put you in charge?!” In Mike's voice.

“Oh fuck off.” I grumbled, crossing my arms over myself like a toddler. I stood up and looked around. It was an incredibly dusty basement, filled with furniture covered in moth holed white sheets.

There was some light which I assumed belonged to the morning sun, coming in from the top of a staircase. I climbed to the top of it and found myself in an abandoned manor house. It reminded me of a Tudor yeomans house Uncle Kevin made us all go in once. Graffiti covered most of the walls and the windows were smashed, leaving shattered glass across the wooden floor boards. But the place seemed to have sturdy bones and had stood the test of time as well as the test of druggies and teenagers. I was surprised that the furniture in the basement hadn’t been taken, that’s what made me think it was rebellious teens rather than proper wrong uns. We don’t really get proper wrong uns round here. We also don’t have a lot of teenagers either but I suspect they might be wandering over from nearby neglected seaside towns.

I looked outside of one of the gaps where a window used to be and realised the house was on a hill that overlooked some wetlands. Not too far away was my village. The sun was rising over the aforementioned horizon and slowly lighting up the manor house. I decided I would take a quick look around then hop out of one of the windows and trudge back home to find Mike. Then I’d apologise to him profusely. I would’ve liked to stay longer and look over the manor but I was exhausted. But what I did notice, carved elegantly into the walls above the doorways, was a large letter M surrounded by decoration.

As I was staring I unzipped my pocket and put my hand in there. I found the small bottle of whiskey.

“Result!” I laughed to myself.

Before jumping out of the window, I sipped some more whiskey to null the pain of my arm scrapes and leg aches. It made me feel queasy on my empty stomach, but I dealt with it. I made a pitiful attempt at parkouring out the window and onto the grass below. It got me out of the building at least. Even if I bashing my knee on the window sill on the way down.

Feeling the roughest I’ve ever felt in my life I trudged on through wet lands. I passed by some dog walkers in quarter zips who seemed quite dismayed by my appearance. I gave them a polite wave and a smile and tried to act as normal as possible till I was out of view.

My trainers, which were already moist from the tunnels, became completely sodden. By some miracle I didn’t get trenchfoot and eventually I reached the beach where I took my shoes and socks off. I left them behind on a rock, deciding they were ruined beyond saving. Really, I just couldn’t be asked to carry them.

As I marched onward letting the sand dry my feet. I watched the sea slowly receding from the beach. I imagined the monster not so far off in the deeper and bluer part of the channel lurking, waiting. It made me angry. Frustrated. I wanted to know two things and I didn’t care all that much about anything else to do with it; What did it want and how do I get rid of it? I think I know the answer to the first question, but it's the second one I really want to know.

If anyone has any ideas about what would kill a sea creature let me know. I was thinking fire? Something that's the opposite to what it is. Maybe I should just get a gun off a friend of mine that does clay pigeon shooting and wait in the tunnel ready to snipe it. What about electrocuting the water? Is that viable or will I kill myself?

As I got closer and closer to my village the caves came into view. Someone was waiting by them. I saw a young man with unruly hair and a faded denim jacket sitting outside them on the sand. His arms were clasped around his knees hugging himself. He was staring out into the sea. As I got closer I realised it was Mike.

“Mike!” I waved at him, running over.

His head snapped toward me and he looked at me like I was a ghost. He’d been crying.

“Oh thank god!” He burst into sobs as he stood up. When we met he pulled me into a hug and continued to weep. I had to yank myself out of the hug.

“What’s wrong?” I asked him gently.

“Well you just fuckin disappeared. I thought…” He took a shaky breath and tried to form words without sobs. “I saw it swim out of the cave….It had someone….they weren’t dead yet.” His voice got choked on the final words.

“What?” Was all I could ask.

Mike looked like he was going to be sick and his whole body began to tremble. “It had someone.” He repeated a tear rolling down his freckled face.

“Mike, we have to go and tell someone. Did you phone the police? If someone’s gone missing from the pub we have to report it. We don't have to say who did it.” I tried to reason with him but Mike simply shook his head. His mouth stayed pursued like someone who was barely containing a gigantic chuck up. A look I only usually saw on him when he greened out.

I have to say. The fact he just froze when he thought I’d been carried off by a sea monster wasn’t a comforting thought. But then what was he supposed to do? If he phoned up the police and told him hey my cousin has been carried off into the sea by a creepy monster thing, they’d assume Mike did it and put him away for life. His dad and the rest of our family would probably think the same. Even our family won’t protect each other from the law. Not that kind of law anyway. When someone's being hurt at least. I wouldn’t protect my family member if they murdered someone, especially not one of our own.

Mike looked like a man drained, like something sun bleached and washed up by the sea, his skin the colour of pale driftwood. I had zero idea what to say to him. I had an apology prepared. But now wasn’t the time. Someone had died and we now had to get our story straight. It felt scummy and dirty but I had to think about who saw us go into the pub the other night and what I was going to tell the police when they came knocking. We’d both need alibis that weren’t each other. I won’t lie, I was basing all of these thoughts off of movies and TV shows and know very little about UK investigative laws. It wrecked my conscience to be thinking about these things when someone was dead.

Morning swimmers began to appear on the beaches and we both took that as a queue to get moving. Mike turned to walk up the beach but I urged him back.

“The tunnel goes straight to the cellar, I know for sure now.” I told him.

“Oh.” He looked at it unsurely.

“Don’t worry, the tides out.”

“Is it a good idea to go to the pub right now?”

“It will look more suspicious if we avoid it.”

He nodded and followed me silently. At the mouth of the cave he paused and looked at me.

“How far did you get in?” He asked, putting his hands into his pockets trying not to look scared.

“I have no idea. But I’ll tell you what happened as we go.” I promised. “The walk’s long enough.” I forced an awkward laugh. Mike didn’t match it or give me a smile. He just nodded silently and marched on alongside [me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mhq4xj/i_inherited_my_grandads_pub_but_i_cant_bring/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
