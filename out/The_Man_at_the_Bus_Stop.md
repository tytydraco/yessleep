So, this weird thing happened to me a while back, and I still get creeped out thinking about it. I was waiting for the bus one night after a long shift at work. It was dark, and the streetlights kept flickering, making everything feel kinda off.

As I stood there scrolling through my phone, I noticed this guy across the street at the bus stop. He looked kinda shady—worn-out clothes and this intense stare that made me uncomfortable. I tried to ignore him, telling myself I was just being paranoid.

A few minutes passed, and I looked up again. The guy was still there, but now he was staring right at me. I felt a chill run down my spine. I thought maybe he was just waiting for someone, so I tried to shake it off.

Then my bus finally showed up. I hopped on and found a seat by the window. As we started driving away, I looked back, and there he was, still watching me. My stomach dropped.

The bus ride felt way too long. I kept glancing out the window, half-expecting to see him following us. When I finally got off at my stop, I rushed to my apartment, trying to shake off that creepy feeling.

But then, the next night, I had to wait for the bus again, and guess what? That same guy was there! He was even closer this time, and I was freaking out. I couldn't wait for my bus to come.

When the bus arrived, I practically jumped on and sat down, but I was still nervous. I kept looking back, thinking he was somehow connected to me. I couldn’t help it.

Finally, I got off at my stop again and rushed home. I decided I would avoid that bus stop for a while. But a few nights later, I thought, “It’s probably all in my head,” and went back out. Guess who was there? Yep, the same guy. This time, he had this creepy smile on his face.

I got on the bus again, my heart racing. I was sure he was coming after me. I felt his eyes on me the whole ride. When I finally got off, I sprinted home, locking the door behind me. That night, I barely slept, jumping at every little noise.

Days went by, and I finally decided to switch up my routine. I took a different bus line and went out of my way to avoid that guy. But one night, I got on a bus, and there he was, sitting right across from me!

I was frozen. He stared at me and then leaned in closer, whispering, “I’ve been waiting for you.”

My heart dropped. I bolted off the bus at the next stop and didn’t stop running until I got home. I locked the door and sat in my living room, trying to figure everything out.

The next morning, I decided to report him to the police. I told them what happened, but they looked at me like I was crazy. They said there wasn’t much they could do unless he did something to me.

I started carrying pepper spray and asked friends to walk with me to the bus stop.

One night, I was out with friends and completely forgot about that guy. We were laughing and having a great time. But when I was walking home, I passed that old bus stop and felt my heart drop.

Guess who was waiting there? Yup, that creepy dude. He wasn’t just staring this time; he was right in front of the bus stop, looking like he was waiting for me. I couldn’t believe it.

I turned to walk away, but he shouted, “You can’t run from me forever!”

I ran home like I was being chased. That was it for me. I never went back to that bus stop. I found a new job closer to home, started taking Ubers, and did everything I could to avoid that part of town.

It’s been years, and I still think about that guy. Did he mean to scare me? Was he just a creep, or was there something more to him? Honestly, I’m just glad I never found out.
