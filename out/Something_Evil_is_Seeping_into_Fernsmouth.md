I was surprised to see her back in the building. She had kept her head down in the pews, but now in the confession booth, her breaths came out in choked sobs. The sound sent goosebumps up my arms.

“Heather what is it?” I asked, my voice hushed even though it was only us left in the building. Hiccupping she took several breaths.

“Father, I am so sorry. I’ve done something terrible.” she shudders, the movement is jerky and awkward. 

“Tell me then Heather, you can trust me. Does Larry know anything about this?” Peering through the screen she nods.

“It was him that did it. I watched it happen, oh god Father. They’re watching everywhere, but not here for some reason.” I didn’t have any clue what she was talking about. This was the first I had heard of her husband in some time, the first I had seen her in some time.

"Where is your husband?” I asked. “I haven’t seen him in three months, I thought you had disappeared along with him.” I hadn’t laid eyes on Heather in well over a month. 

“They took him, and then they took me Father.” she inhales again, sitting up a little straighter. “That therapy group he joined, they’re beyond demented. The missing people, it's because of them.”

“Amity ? The therapy group?” I had lost some of my congregation to them, a self help group that offered alternatives my church could not. Friendly competition at most, a different path to peace. Heather jerked her head up and down.

“People who go there get sucked into their group, some get taken from their homes.” I shuddered at the mention of the missing family. They had left one depressed girl in their wake. I had been brought in to talk to her at the station. What the officers thought I could do, I was most unsure. The only response I had gotten from the girl had been a muttered thanks. I couldn't blame her. Who wanted some preacher in their ear after something like that?

“Heather, have you gone to the police about this? What sort of proof do you have?” She only started sobbing again. 

“It was Larry oh god, he was so confused.” she started hyperventilating at this point. Rushing out of the booth I swung open her door, and let her pile into my arms. 

“Breath, Heather please just breathe, you can tell me here, you know that.” She clung to me with hands of iron, skinny fingers digging into my arms with all the ferocity of a tiger. 

“Larry killed Dave Sanders, and we all just watched.” Her eyes shot wide open, looking into mine with a fear that made me pale.

“You watched?” I asked. I started to drag her to her feet. “We need to go to the station right now, and tell the officers!”

“No!” she screamed and pulled away from me, darting to the altar, curling around it like a scared cat. “Some of them were there. You’ll feed me to them. I need you to believe me Father Owen. I’ve been hiding like a rat for a week now, and all I know is that they won’t come here, they avoid the church no matter what.” She fell down to her knees, hands locked together. “Please, I beg you. Just listen to me Father. I don’t know what else to do.” Her hands ran through her hair. “God they’re getting bigger by the day.” Letting out a breath I indulged her. 

Her story was insane, and disjointed. Everything about it told me the woman’s mind had broken. Her story claimed that Amity Aims was a cult making people disappear. Everybody was in on it, members of the police force, some members of the town council. I did what I could to comfort the lady.

“Breathe Heather, is there anywhere I can take you?” I asked. She shook her head rapidly. She seemed adamant about the murder her husband had committed. 

“No please just hide me here for a while Father. There has to be someone you can talk to, please just help me.” I cupped my hands over hers.

“Easy now Heather, you can stay here. I’ll grab you some supplies, so you can hide for a time.” 

“Thank you, thank you, thank you.” she said bowing at my feet. I reassured her one more time, ignoring my pity for the woman. A terrible thing to do as a preacher, but her story was unhinged. The grief of her missing husband had driven her over the edge. Something becoming more common as the missing persons count grew higher.

The station wasn’t far from the church, and the interior was warm, the smell of black coffee wafting in the room. The lady behind looked tired, her blond hair done up in a tight bun. She smiled brightly as I walked towards the desk.

“Father Owen, how can I help you today?” She ran a finger over a silver ring. 

“Hello Leslie, this is a lot to dump on you, but Heather Strude just showed up at the church out of the blue.” Leslie raised an eyebrow. 

“Really? She’s been missing for awhile now, what did she say to you?” I relayed the story, watching her brows raise higher and higher as it went on. She leaned back when I finished furrowing her brow. “The chief will want to know about this. He’ll probably want to go with you. Wait here please Father.” I sat down in one of the uncomfortable chairs in the lobby and tapped my feet. I felt like a schoolboy waiting for the principal. 

The chief came into the lobby with another officer, Desmond, a local of the town. 

“Hello Father.” The chief was a kind man. Silver haired, with a well groomed mustache. “I hear you’ve found a missing person, for me.” I smiled.

“I wish I could take the credit sir, but she came to mass today. She needs help.” He nodded grimly.

“So I’ve heard, Desmond and I will follow you back to the church, and take her in. Good chance she’ll know where the other missing people are.” he motioned to the door. “After you Father.”



The door to the church creaked open, Heather was nowhere to be found. I turned back to Chief Greg. “There’s a good chance she’ll be down near the kitchen. There’s a spare bed down there.” I stopped again. “She’s also very on edge, I’ll go down first just to calm her.” The men nodded, as I pushed a door open into a small hallway. The kitchen was small, the stove light on, a bed not far from it just barely visible in the pale yellow light. “Heather?” I called warily. My footsteps creaked on the floor.

Hands grabbed me as I stepped further into the room, something sharp was against my throat.

“You got the police.” she hissed. She pressed the knife further into my skin.

“Of course Heather, please just let go of the knife. They’re here to help.”

“Did you see their hands?” Heather’s words jabbed into my ears, her breath hot.

“Heather please, what are you talking about?” I squirmed in her grip, only causing her to hold me tighter.

“You have to look at their hands they have a-” 

“Hands now!” The two officers had their guns pointed at Heather, eyes locked onto the woman. Using the distraction I pushed from her grasp, as Desmond rushed in and tackled her, ripping the knife from her hand. She screamed, flailing and crying as he cuffed her. 

She screamed all the way as they drug her out into the daylight towards the muddy police vehicle. The RCMP logo covered with a layer of brown filth.

“You killed me Father, you killed me!” she howled like a banshee, some onlookers watching with horrified expressions. The two men wrestled her into the car, slamming the door. Her cries were muffled. Greg let out a sigh.

“You alright Father?” he asked. My hands shook at my sides. I could feel a light scratch where the knife had dug into my throat. I took a deep breath clasping my neck.

“I will, thank you gentlemen. I’m just glad I was able to help. Have a blessed day.” Greg looked at me with skepticism in his eyes.

“You need anything else Owen you know where to find us, hell you know where to find me. You need a free meal or something, come on over.” I assured him once more. The drive back to my home passed in a daze. Only when I pulled into my driveway, did I wake up. Three dogs had knocked over my trash can and were digging through it. They were skinny and mangy, their unclean fur reached my nostrils as I stepped out. 

“Beat it!” I yelled at them. They froze heads snapping up. Their eyes were wide mouths agape with sharp yellow teeth. One snarled, and I leapt back a hand on my throat. What was I thinking? They could maul me if they wanted to. Instead they barked loudly before tearing off into the neighbourhood. Grumbling, I stuffed my garbage back and wearily stepped into my home.



The tv hummed away, I couldn’t even remember what I had thrown on. I felt restless, as Heather's words rang in my head. Guilt made my insides boil. Though I didn’t know why. Praying had offered little consolation. If the lord was listening, he offered no signs. I shut off the tv, the silence deafening. Every creak of the house seemed so much louder than it had before. My clock ticked and tocked, an unceasing marching beat. 

The sound was just audible enough that I had to stop several times, to make sure it was real. It was coming from my backyard. Slowly I crept towards my backdoor, the glass window fogged up from the night air. I tried in vain to look through it, but I could just barely make out the shapes in my backyard. The blurry forms of my garden beds, and a table I had left out were just visible. The sound was wet, occasionally a snap would accompany the sound of something being torn. Slipping on my shoes, I grew bold and opened the backdoor. 

Yellow light flooded the backyard, showing nothing. The sound stopped. From where I stood, I could see over the fence that hemmed in my yard. Three sets of glowing eyes peered back at me. The shapes were lithe just visible in the dark. They started growling. I leapt back looking at what must have been the three dogs from earlier, or coyotes. I had no idea of knowing. I opened my mouth to yell at them, when a fourth shape rose from the dark.

It moved slowly in a fluid motion, its eyes glowing in the dark.Then it moved forward. A long pale hand with sharp yellow nails, rested on the top of my fence. The fingers were covered in a dark red. Some tiny voice in my head told me it was blood. The light shone on the torso of the figure, revealing the ends of snow white hair, and a long slender neck. The jaw of the figure was matted in blood. The dogs began barking, yapping in a loud frenzy. The figure raised another blood covered hand in a wave. The lips began moving a hissing sound coming from them. Like they were trying to talk. 

I didn’t wait to listen. I slammed the door shut, watching as the figure leapt over the fence and started walking straight towards the backdoor. I screamed and burst out of my front door, into the cold night. Something slammed behind me, glass broke. My keys were still in the house, so I sprinted down the sidewalk, screaming the entire way. I could hear the figure behind me, footsteps getting closer, the dogs growling and yapping. 

The red house was near the corner of the street, and I leapt up the stairs and banged on the door with all my might. It swung open revealing a disheveled Chief Greg in a bathrobe, with his gun in hand.

“Owen what the hell?” he shouted. “Look out!” The growling dogs behind me stood at the steps snapping maws covered in blood. “Get out of here you mutts, get out!” he bellowed. The dogs sprinted into the dark. “What’s going on?” Owen turned to me.

“There was someone outside my house! They were with those dogs.” I whirled behind me scanning the darkness for any movement. The figure had vanished. It didn’t take long for police to surround my house, the blue and red lights dancing in the night sky. 

Greg stood with two other officers behind the fence. They had scanned the house, the only sign of an intruder was my backdoor that had been kicked open. The figure hadn’t left any other signs of entry. No footprints, or anything. The only thing they had found was a dead deer. The body mangled and torn into the stomach nothing but a hollow cave of rib bone and flesh.

“We’ll get this cleaned up for you Father. Are you sure you saw somebody?” he peered into my eyes. 

“Yes Greg, I’ll never forget what she looked like.” I sat down, hands on my knees. I would never get to sleep tonight. Greg set a hand on my shoulder.

“Alright then, we’ll keep an eye on your house for a few times Owen, best I can do.” He waved a hand around the house. “We’ll even set you up with some security alarms to help you feel safe again. Just try to sleep tonight.” He gave me one last concerned look before leaving. I stayed awake the entire night.



Even though I knew it was a mistake, I left my house. Some men came by early to install my security alarms. One of them had a silver ring on. Heather’s warning echoed in my mind. The hands. People in the grocery store were wearing them. Seemingly only a few at first, but the number grew. I counted five at least. The cashier waved at me and told me to have a good day. Her ring glinting in the sun. Three more people wore them. I drove straight back to my house, she had been right the entire time.

The alarms were installed on my house, a guide was tucked underneath my welcome mat. They were easy to turn on, seemingly normal. I knew better than to trust these. Both of those men might have also had rings as well. Did this mean some sort of group had invaded Fernsmouth? What was their goal? I closed my blinds and rooted through my house like a rat. I found two cameras. Small bug eyed things, one on my tv sensor, and one concealed behind some books in my room. 

They had already invaded my home. Time passed in a slow crawl, as I jolted at every sound. I didn’t even know if I could trust my neighbours. Lord I had turned Heather right over into their hands. She was as good as dead for all I knew. The police force was compromised to an extent. If only I had looked at their hands, the only one so far was Leslie. But what about Greg himself, or Desmond, or the other officer that had shown up last night? The sun sank beneath the horizon and the shadows crept back in. 

I looked through my window blinds and saw a police car parked out front. I only hoped I could trust them. How easy would it be for them to walk in and shoot me? 

I didn’t aim to find out, and tried to keep myself up through the night again. Slowly yet surely the exhaustion began to take me.

The creaking awoke me first. His massive frame filled my view, the only thing visible in the dark. 

“Father,” he said. 

“Larry?” I mumbled. The punch knocked me onto the floor, something in my face cracked. The taste of iron filled my mouth, as a tooth fell out of my mouth. I tried to drag myself across the floor, but a large hand grabbed me by the back of my neck, and threw me into my kitchen. 

“This is my next step, Father, so I get better. My mistress will watch.” The words make no sense, I don’t have time to process them. This man is a killer. Before I can get back up, a foot slams into my chest, and I feel a rib crack. Wheezing I swipe at the man, but my hits do nothing. His massive hands wrap around my throat. He lifts me like a doll, and spots and stars dance in my vision as the breath leaves my chest. “Witness mistress, witness please.”

The man lifts me above the kitchen sink, and my eyes lock onto the pale figure again. The woman smiles with glee as the moonlight shows her manic expression as the life is squeezed from me. My hand fumbles in the dark, as everything dims, latching onto the handle of the knife, I bring it up in an arc. The blade plunges into Larry’s shoulder, and he bellows like a beast from Hell. He stumbles back into the counter smashing his head into a cupboard. 

Scrambling I bolt for the door, slamming into my kitchen table, and spiraling into my couch. The brute recovers quickly, grabbing me by my right arm. He forces me to the ground, and before I can register what he’s doing, a massive weight slams down onto my elbow. Bone cracks and pain explodes in my arm. I know I screamed, but somehow the pain drowns it out. The only thing I can hear is a dull ringing in my ears. Larry roars again, lunging down at me.

The front door bursts open. I watch Larry look up in confusion at the light from outside, displaying a feral looking man, his shoulder a deep dark red. The next moment his fleshy throat explodes into pulp, his left eye explodes, as a part of his skull goes with it. Greg rushes over me, his words ringing as he tries to say something to me, but oblivion takes me.



My arm is shattered making it rather difficult to type all of this. Larry almost killed me, a man I considered a friend. I’m grateful Greg was there to save me. I’m in the hospital right now, some of the staff are wearing silver rings. I can’t be here for much longer. Something evil has seeped into my town, and I need to find out what.
