I lie in wait for a matter of moments until I watch the creature slowly disappear, backing into the shadows behind her. Then, I wait some more. As I do so, my eyes dart around the sides of the house, to the back. Small wooden panels act as windows, they look as if they can be slid aside from the inside. 

I look to the small shack that rests beside the house; there’s bound to be a hammer, hopefully some nails, in there. I’ll go there first, then decide my plan of action. Once I’m confident that the creature isn't still watching me, I creep out from the bush that had kept me hidden so well. 

I run to the shack with a crouch, carefully placing my feet where they’ll make the least noise as I attempt to avoid the leaves scattered on the ground. I reach the shack and, holding my breath, push against the door. It opens slowly and I twist my head inside of it, squinting my eyes in an attempt to peer through the darkness. What I see inside almost makes me shout out in joy. Tools; a lot of them. I slide the rest of my body through the gap in the door and quickly look through what I have available to me. I soon find a hammer, smaller than the one Asri had provided to me, but certainly sturdy enough to smash in a nail. Now to find a nail – the bigger, the better. I flick through the remainder of the rusty tools; wrenches, spanners, screwdrivers – but no nails! I start to panic, pulling the door behind me shut before returning to search the tool box more thoroughly. My hand starts to ache as it pushes aside the heavy metal and, just as I’m losing hope, I notice something sticking out of the wooden floor that I stand on.

It’s a nail. I almost didn’t see it though the dark as it’s barely poking out of the wood, but I could use the hammer to pull it out and just hope it’s not been too badly bent. I fall to my knees and, as I clip the hammer into the head of nail, I notice three of four more nails protruding from the wood nearby. I breathe a quiet sigh of relief as I finally feel things are starting to go my way a little. I pull the first nail out, struggling as I reach the end; it’s bent, no use. The second nail slides from the ground easily – it is rusty, extremely so, but it is also long and straight. I prod the end with my finger and it feels sturdy enough. I put it beside me and pull out the remaining nails. 

As I stand to leave the shack, I hold a hammer and two nails I can use. I press my head against the inside of the closed door and close my eyes.

I must make a decision.

I can’t use a child, can I?

*I don’t have a choice.*

No! I do have a choice. That child has done nothing to me, nothing at all.

*It’s not like I’ll let him die, I just need her to focus on him for a moment so I can kill her.*

What if I fuck it up?

*Stop it. I won’t fuck it up.* 

No. I won’t use him as bait. I can’t.

I hear footsteps from outside the shack and I freeze, my eyes open fast.

*Crunch crunch crunch crunch*

The woman. She’s back and right outside. She’s –

I hear a door open to the side of the shack and gently close.

The outhouse.

It’s one of the people from the house. They’re using the bathroom. I slowly push the door to the shack open and look to the outhouse – a dim light comes from behind its closed door. I hear a woman cough from within.

It’s the mother. She’s using the bathroom. Which means –

*Which means the child is alone.*

But that means…

I look up at the house just as I see the woman run through its front door, her broken wrists dragging the dirt behind her.

“NO!” I shout, bursting from the shack and running toward the house, “Get away from him!”

The door is wide open as I reach it and quickly burst into the house. I hear the cry of the boy to my side. I turn to the left and stare in horror as the woman kneels above the young boy, tracing her fingernails over his chest. Blood drips from her mouth as she salivates from her insatiable hunger. Her head drops and I see my chance. There is a crevice in the back of her neck, at the top of her spine. Within the crevice, a small opening, covered only by a thin layer of black skin, appears to pulsate and thrive. 

I hold the nail tight, screaming in pain as my disjointed wrist tries desperately to let it go, and I plunge it through the layer of darkened skin. The creature stiffens before me and starts to let out a low gurgle. I hold the hammer high and bring it down onto the roof of the nail.

One hit.

She stiffens further. The nail does not go in fully; there is a degree of resistance.

Two hits. 

She pulsates, and starts to let out a gurgled scream.

Three hits.

Dark black sludge pours from out from her – her mouth, eyes, ears. It drips onto the wood below and appears to melt it as it lands.

Four hits.

The nail is almost fully in now. She is silent. Her spine protrudes down her back and through her skin, tearing it as the jagged bones escape their prison. Her hands clench the ground tight, snapping all of her finger nails with one swift squeeze. 

Five hits.

The nail fully enters her and she drops the ground, resting on top of the young child. She starts to writhe, seizing as her hands claw and grab at all of her surroundings. I quickly grab the feet of the boy and pull him away from her. His mother, who I had not notice enter, takes him from my grasp and pulls him close to her. The creature is now a blur, moving so fast that my eyes cannot keep up. She violently thrashes and flails, although makes no sound. Then, almost as soon as she starts, she stops.

And, in her place, there is a young woman curled up on the ground. She is shaking and appears scared. She looks at me in fear, in confusion, and then scans her eyes around the room as if she didn’t recognise this place. The long white gown that the creature had worn fit the woman well, and was no longer dirty but was in fact pristinely clean. The fingernails of the woman, her hands, everything; normal.

She appears to be a normal woman.

Except for her neck. Just beneath her skin, the indent of the top of a nail rests. 

I fall backward to the ground, panting heavily, shaking even heavier. The woman before me looks to me, then to the ground in shame.

I turn and look back as I hear a scream behind me.

The mother’s scream.

I was too slow.

She squeezed the boy tight.

I was too slow.

The child had been bitten.

I was too slow.

I sit on the boat of a fisherman who comes by the house every morning. He said he would take me back to the mainland. Sitting opposite me, the woman, the creature, now completely normal. She is very timid, not making eye contact with myself or the boat driver for the journey. 

We all sit in silence.

The boat skims across the waters which once looked blue and beautiful, but now appear murky and treacherous. As we zip along the river bank, I stare into the trees thinking of the previous few nights. 

I should have done better.

I didn’t save anyone.

I didn’t save anyone at all.

Thirty minutes pass and I see a clearing in the trees on the bank of the river. It is a clearing I recognise, with banana trees resting either side of it. Beside one of the trees, I see Siti looking out onto the water. As my eyes lock into hers, her mouth opens in shock; she is surprised to see me. I coldly stare at her as she drops her gaze to the ground and turns to quickly walk up the path to the house. As she turns, she places her hand on the back of her neck, covering it. But she does not cover it fast enough as I am able to make out the outline of a nail, resting just beneath her skin.

I look up the path and see Asri who has also seen me as he beckons her to quickly return to the house. We soon pass the clearing and I cannot see them or their house anymore.

My eyes drop to the water which is quickly passing us by, then up to the woman sitting before me in the boat.

I almost don’t see the rustle in the trees behind the woman, but I do. My eyes focus in on that spot, assuming it’s an animal of some sort. But it’s not.

It’s a face.

It's a face I recognise.

It’s the face of the mother, the mother from the house.

She is pale, and wears a long white gown.

She looks pained, tormented.

She looks angry.

Blood drips from the side of her lips and onto the ground below, [splashing into the soil beside her freshly broken wrists.](https://www.reddit.com/r/squishycabbage/)
