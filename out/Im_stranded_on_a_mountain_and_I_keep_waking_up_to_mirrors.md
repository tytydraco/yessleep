Have you ever had a sinking feeling in your soul when being alone? That void that can only be filled with an interaction with another person. I remember that feeling, only now I know that true loneliness lies in the mountains.

Watching as 24 hours pass by with no sign of life, only yourself, has a way of slowing the world down. I don't know why I'm logging this, maybe I hope someday someone may read my ramblings. Or maybe I'm doing exactly what it wants.

I've had so much time to think over how I ended up in this situation. The series of events that led me to this point. How easy it would've been to not be here. To never see that crashed war plane. To never get the stupid idea to see it in person. To simply stay in my warm home and watch cheesy horror movies.

But instead, with just a jacket and a backpack full of granola bars. I turned the keys to my ignition, put in the GPS and left. Not prepared for anything. I never was as my wife would say. She always admired my wistful unpreparedness. Wishing she could possess herself not to worry about so many details. God, I miss her.

The thought never crossed my mind to even tell anyone where I had gone. I was alone, no other person climbing with me. No stranger passing me by on the breathtaking trail on the Appalachian. I actually counted myself lucky for having the whole mountain to myself.

The B-29 bomber was about 2 miles down the glacier. I was excited, so naive, thinking I would make it back home before the sun had time to set. The weather was nice enough, and I had done the 10 miles up the mountain with no fits, so any worry was absent from my mind. 

The snow was that of a fantasy. It felt as though I could see the design of the crystals before they landed. But as time went, as I climbed down the ice towards the plane, the bright fluffy textured snow turned thicker. The speed of the wind blared between my ears like a siren that was warning me to get off the mountain. A sign that I ignored.

I kept going, thinking to myself "the cold will pass, the wind will stop, the snow would melt".

I thought I had seen the worse a winter storm could get. In my hometown the snow would get high, but manageable. The temperatures would fall, but I never needed more than an extra layer to walk outside.

Except the snow never slowed down; the temperature kept dropping and the wind kept howling. The areas around me began to disappear, and the ground was becoming quicksand, slowly sinking me into its grasp. I had never felt this type of cold before. Any part of my body, exposed or not, felt the wind pierce down to the bone.

The weather became unbearable as I went down the mountain. I couldn't feel my toes walking beneath the snow anymore. My hands became useless, turning bright red and leathery. The sensation of needles constantly biting my skin was overwhelming my entire body. My face felt like it had no expression no matter how much I crinkled my nose or furrowed my eyebrow. I kept my head down trying to cover up as much as possible, it was no use, the only shield was other parts of my body sacrificing itself to spare one another from the bitter wind.

I couldn't gage wear the trail was anymore, the snow covered everything. The reality that I would not make it home started to sink in. I wanted to give up then, burry myself underneath the snow and wait for someone to rescue me just so my body would stop aching from the wind.

*\*Thud\**

It was then that my head rung form hitting a flat wall. I looked up to see a cabin, so out of place I almost couldn't believe it was real. I thought I was hallucinating until I opened the door and felt the cold breeze no more. I shook off the pound of snow that had begun to form on my back. Threw my bag to the ground and huddled in the fetal position on a cot.

I was a combination of numb and exhausted. Sleep evaded me because of how bad my body was shaking. When I regained feeling in my arms and legs, I was able to take off my jacket so it could dry. Only then was I able to investigate what had saved my life. The place seemed like a survival cabin. I remembered hearing about them in high school. The forest service would build a shelter on mountains to save idiots like me in emergencies.

There wasn't a lot of space, maybe the size of a small bedroom. Accompanied by a workbench, and 2 windows. One above the bench and the other across the room to the right where the cot was. It's not a warm paradise by any means, but it blocked the cold air.

I checked my phone to confirm what I already knew, no service. The light was quickly disappearing making it almost impossible to see anything around me. There was no light switch, so I had to resort to my phone's flashlight. I suspected the storm would last no more than a night or two. I emptied my bag of food and water onto the workbench, calculating that I had enough to last me till then. Mistake, mistake, mistake.

The first night is when it started. If I had known what would follow, I would've never stepped foot into the cabin.

The first thing I remember was the wind brushing against my face shocking me awake. The door was open and not just a slight crack I mean the door was all the way against the interior wall. In the brief moment where my eyes had just opened, I noticed something... something that was not meant to be on a mountain. I only noticed again right before I had shut the door. At the time I only wanted to go back to sleep, so any sense of danger was not something I possessed. Only now, I know what I saw. A mirror... A thin body mirror starring directly at me sleeping.

When I awoke the next day, I thought the whole thing had to be a dream. To ease my mind, I opened the door again to see nothing but white. "A dream", I told myself.

That day the snow would start and stop irregularly. Anytime I had the thought to try my luck down the mountain, the weather would force me against it. So, I waited... and waited, but after a while I knew I was staying in the cabin another day.

Searching around my new little home, I found a couple wooden toys under the bed. They both were the same human-like figurines. "Why is everything made out of wood?", I thought. It was then that I took a closer look into the structure of the cabin. Everything seemed to be made out of actual trees. I'm sure that sounds stupid, but it was like someone had crafted everything by hand. There was clay in between the logs on the wall to cover any holes. I wasn't sure how survival cabins were built so it wasn't out of the realm of possibility that they used the land to build it. But the thought that I was living in someone else's home was not a comforting one. "What if they came back? Would they force me to get out?", there was barely enough space for me as it was. I started to come up with speeches just in case I had to plead my case.

I kept checking my phone, mostly out of habit, but also for missed calls, texts, any notification that would magically appear. But the screen never changed, and my optimism kept spiraling. I had to shut it off to conserve the 5% battery I had left. I tried to sleep, hoping that the nightmare would end when I woke up again. But the bare mattress might as well have been a sheet of paper, protecting me from a concrete floor. It was strange, I had remembered the bed being much more cushioned. By the end of the day, I found myself playing with the toys like action figures.

The task to do absolutely nothing bore fast, I was thankful to be leaving the next day. If I had to stare off into space one more time I was going to lose it. Fresh air sounded like heaven to me at that point. No matter how much shock my body would feel from the numbing gust of air. The door began to taunt me, wanting to open its latch so the barrier between mother nature and I could be funneled through it.

Knowing that I still had some control left empowered me. That at any time I still had the choice of opening the door and letting the cold air face me. My gratification, however, was short lived. This time, I knew I wasn't dreaming. When I opened the door, I was confronted by a person standing against the night sky in the distance.

Not questioning how someone could've possibly made it up the mountain I shouted out. "Hey! Hey!! I need help! Help!!".

When he turned to look at me he was noticeably sluggish. It took him a solid 20 seconds to fully face me. That doesn't sound like a lot but in real time it was as if he moved in slow motion. Silence echoed off the mountain, there was no wind no squeaking snow, nothing but the sound of my breathing. The moon was my only light source only allowing me to make out a helmet and some kind of jumpsuit he was wearing.

"Hey man are you ok?", I yelled at him. I began to worry that this was the man's cabin. I didn't know what else to do. He stayed stiff, unfazed by the cold. I started to feel bad for the man, maybe he had lost it. I didn't want to leave the cabin, but I couldn't let someone else stay out there to freeze to death. So, despite my better judgment, I zipped up my jacket and turned on my phone's flashlight. But the second both my feet touched the snow, the mysterious man sprinted full speed at me. I was horrified as his body looked like it had no spine.

The speed he was going seemed superhuman. I barely had time to turn around and close the door before he was right behind me. I held it with my body, waiting for the impact. But there was nothing, nobody barreling at the door, no footstep right outside, not even a knock. It was too quiet, my breathing the only sound again. Until that silence was suddenly cut by belting laughter. I covered my ears fearing my eardrums would tear from how emphatic the noise was. It felt like I was inside of a speaker. Laughter was the closes thing to describe it because it wasn't a normal sound. It was like someone who was trying to imitate laughter.

The man or whatever it was didn't stop for 5 straight minutes, not even to catch his breath. It felt like being in a continuous loop. "Shut up, shut up SHUT UP!!", I kept saying. But nothing made it stop. It sounded like combinations of a mentally insane person's laugh an animal's screams. My body was shivering, realizing that I had nobody, no friendly neighbor, or first responder to help. Just a piece of wood separating me and the crazed man or... or thing. I had no control left. After the laughter finally stopped, I kept my body against the door. Nothing was getting in or out of the cabin.

I awoke in the same position, unaware when I fell asleep. I immediately searched around to confirm if anything was moved or stolen. But everything seemed in the right place. I took a sigh of relief knowing that whatever was out there couldn't have survived the night. I felt like I was already losing my mind in 2 days.

Didn't feel like 2 days, more like weeks. Have I become this dependent on my phone and TV to occupy my day? That two full days without a bright screen changes my perception of time. I needed to eat something to take my off this thought. After finishing my food and drinking my portioned water I felt hopeful that today could be the day I escape this nightmare. Only, when I went to look outside, the window was blocked. The only thing I could see was a clear reflection of myself.

I wanted nothing more than to get out. The cold wind slapped me in the face as I kicked open the door to run. The cold still singed my entire body, but I didn't care. I would rather take my odds with the weather than stay another night at that cabin. The sun that was peeking through the thick clouds warmed me just enough to give me hope. But after just 3 minutes my heart felt like it was about to explode. My breathing slowed; the air was so thin I had no more oxygen to inhale. I collapsed on the hard snow, heeling over and puking all of the granola out of my stomach.

The tears forming in my eyes dried out instantly. I went to wipe my face when I saw my fingertips beginning to turn as white as the snow beneath me. No matter how bad I wanted to leave, the mountain wouldn't let me. I stood up off my knees, the cabin was too far away now. My hope did not exist anymore. Sinking, cowering down in between my legs, I gave up. Dying sounded better than frost burning through my skin. My cries couldn't be heard nor seen.

When I gained consciousness, I knew I didn't die. That rich smell of pine had become too familiar. My back felt sore when I rose from the bed. "How long was I asleep?", I thought. I checked my hands; normal. I went to look at myself in the window mirror, only to see the snow glowing.

I didn't care to check if any of my stuff was gone, I knew it didn't want that. It wanted me right here, in its human sized doll house.

The usual empty workbench in front of me now held a notebook and pen. I felt sick... I still am sick knowing that there *is* no escape. I tried to ignore the paper and sleep away all my worries. This only made my mind wander.

"Why mirrors? Why does it want me here? Why doesn't it just kill me? Why, why, why?"

I was beginning to learn that sleep was impossible during the day. The paper and pen had a magnetism that kept drawing me in. I resisted, trying to throw the notebook out entirely, but my body wouldn't allow it. And before I knew it, I was writing the first paragraph.

What do I do now, I don't know. I'm too tired to think anymore. Maybe tomorrow will bring a bright sky and a hot sun that melts ice. Tonight, when I sleep, the windows will have been bordered up and the door barricaded.

I'm alone, I'm stranded, and I'm afraid... Most of all, of what will happen when I am not conscious.
