Rain had been coming down all day like it was on a mission. Heavy raindrops slammed against the windows in waves, and the sky outside was a smear of gray and dark slate. It was the kind of day that makes you feel sorry for the people who have to go outside.

Luckily, I had the whole day off. No work, no responsibilities, just a quiet, wet Saturday in my two bedroom house near the edge of town, the kind of place where the neighbors wave but rarely talk. I had planned a lazy day, video games, junk food, and a movie night with friends.

At around four, Dave and Sarah arrived. Old high school friends, the three of us had been inseparable once, but life has a way of getting in the way. Still, tonight felt like the old days.

The storm picked up around five. The wind had a voice now, high pitched and shrieking, and the trees looked like they were bowing to each other. Thunder rolled in long, slow waves, and lightning flickered like faulty fluorescent lights.

We made dinner, frozen pizza and microwave popcorn, gourmet style, and then queued up some 80s slasher movie Sarah picked. One of those films where the killer is always just behind the door, and no one ever thinks to run for the car. We turned off all the lights. The storm made it perfect.

We spent the next two hours sunk into the couch, the thunder doing half the jump scares for the movie. But the strange stuff did not start until after.

It was close to ten when Dave started dozing off, his head bobbing like a ragdoll. Sarah was scrolling TikTok, the pale blue light from her phone making her look ghostly. I got up to stretch, my spine cracking like dry wood.

That is when I saw it. Just a flicker, something dark moving down the hallway near the baseboards, fast, like a shadow slipping away the moment I looked.

I froze. “Did you guys see that?” I asked, my voice a little too sharp for the quietness of the moment. Dave mumbled, not quite awake. Sarah glanced up and looked a little irritated.

“See what?”

I walked slowly toward the hallway. Nothing there. “Must’ve been the lightning,” I muttered. “Or the movie.”

“Uh huh,” Sarah said, her eyes returning to her phone.

Back in the kitchen, I stared out the window while the tap filled my water glass. The trees were whirling in the wind, the roads practically rivers. We do not get many storms like this around here, but tonight’s storm was in rare form.

I sat back down. The movie had ended, but the mood had not lifted. The room felt off, like it had grown smaller somehow. Then I saw it again.

Behind the TV this time, something moving. Not big, but not small enough to ignore. Just a blink of motion, like someone peeking around the edge of the entertainment center and pulling back before I could focus.

“Did you see that?” I snapped, pointing.

Sarah jumped, dropping her phone. “What the hell, dude?” she said angrily.

“Behind the TV, something moved,” I said, hoping I did not sound crazy.

“I didn’t see anything,” Sarah replied, looking annoyed.

Dave stirred. “What’s going on?”

“Nothing,” I lied. “Just thought I saw something.”

Sarah gave me a look. The kind that says, you’re creeping me out, and not in a fun way.

Dave then looked at Sarah. “Is he freaking out from the movie?”

Sarah giggled. “I think so.”

After about an hour of yawns and waning conversation, Dave got a second wind and decided to watch the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. “I have the remote,” he said, “to rule all remotes.”

Sarah said there was no way she could stay up that long after working all day, so she called it a night and went upstairs to the guest room.

Instead of going to bed, I headed upstairs for a shower, hoping the hot water might quiet my nerves. But I could not shake the feeling that something was watching me. The way you know someone is standing behind you even if you cannot see them.

Then came the sound. A bang. No, a crash. Loud enough to rattle the lights in the bathroom, loud enough to vibrate through my skull. A violent sound, like someone had taken a sledgehammer to a wall.

I shut off the water immediately. The house was silent now. Awfully silent. No creaks. No wind. I heard Dave turn off the TV downstairs. And then, just that heavy, awful nothing.

I opened the door to find Sarah already in the hallway, her hair mussed, eyes wide, too scared even for her typical sarcastic comment.

“You heard that?” I asked.

She nodded but did not speak.

We crept downstairs. No jokes. No banter. Just silence and the thud of our footsteps on the hardwood. Dave met us at the bottom of the stairs, pale and pointing to the back of the house, acting like he had something to say but not able to find the words.

The back door was open. Not just open, destroyed. Hanging by one hinge. The wood around the frame was splintered, like something huge had just burst through.

We stared at it for a long time. Then we ran. Upstairs. Bathroom. Door locked. I called 911 with shaking fingers, told them someone had broken in, was maybe still inside.

The cops arrived fast, flashing lights reflecting against the rain slick streets. They swept the house. Nothing. No footprints. No mud. No sign of forced entry, except the door.

One of the officers, a young guy with a buzz cut and too many tattoos, studied it closely.

“This didn’t break inward,” he said slowly, pointing to the pieces of the frame scattered on the back porch. “This door was busted out from the inside. Like someone slammed into it open hard enough to rip it out of the frame.”

“But we were inside the whole time,” Sarah said.

The cop gave us a look. Not suspicious, not accusing, just unsettled. “You’re sure you didn’t do this?”

“No,” I said. “We locked that door when the storm started. I know we did.”

He nodded and stepped back. “Then whatever was in here, it didn’t come in from outside.”

They left much quicker than we wanted them to. We did not sleep. We stayed in that uncomfortable bathroom until sunrise. We would have left right after the police if there had not been an active tornado watch for this part of the city.

I have not felt right in the house since.

Sarah will not come over anymore. Dave will, but he clearly prefers to meet anywhere else. Whatever I saw, whatever was in here, it did not break in. It was already here. Waiting. Watching. And when it realized we were not going to bed, it left.

But not quietly. It left like something disappointed, frustrated, like it had waited all night and we ruined it.

That is what keeps me up at night. Not that it got in, but that it had planned to stay if we had all fallen asleep.

And next time, it might not be so patient.
