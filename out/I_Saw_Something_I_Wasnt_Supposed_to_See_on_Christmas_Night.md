I don’t know if I should be writing this again.

Part of me feels like the moment I put this into words, I’m inviting it back. But I need to get this out somewhere, even if no one believes me. Especially if no one believes me.

A few nights before Christmas, our neighborhood group chat sent out a strange warning.

They said if we heard noises on our roof late at night—footsteps, scraping, heavy thuds—we were not to investigate. Not to open our windows. Not to go outside. Not even to look.

The message ended with: “Please just stay inside.”

No explanation. No reason given.

At the time, I thought it was a prank. Or maybe someone had seen a raccoon or a drunk neighbor climbing around. Still, the message unsettled me more than I wanted to admit.

For context, I live in a quiet neighborhood. The kind where nothing ever really happens. Next door to us lived an elderly woman named Marie. She was kind. The type of person who remembered birthdays, who occasionally left baked goods on our porch “just because.” She lived alone, and everyone looked out for her.

Christmas Eve came and went quietly.

That night, I was getting ready for bed when I heard it.

A sound from above.

Not a bang. Not a crash.

Heavy, deliberate movement. Like something shifting its weight across the roof.

I froze.

The warning from the group chat echoed in my head. Don’t look. Don’t investigate.

I stood there for a long moment, heart pounding, telling myself it was nothing. Wind. Old shingles. An animal.

Then I heard a wet, tearing sound.

Against every ounce of common sense I had, I slowly moved toward the window.

I told myself I’d just take a quick look. Just enough to reassure myself.

I pulled the curtain back.

That’s when I saw it.

It stood on the neighboring roof, half-lit by a flickering streetlamp. Its body was massive—easily two, maybe three meters tall. Its shape was wrong. Humanoid, but distorted. Its skin was dark, somewhere between black and muddy brown, covered in thick, matted hair or something like it.

Its head… I still struggle to describe it.

It looked like a mix between a bull and a goat. Long, twisted horns. A stretched skull. Eyes sunken deep into its face.

Its legs bent the wrong way, ending in hooves.

And in one of its hands, it was carrying something.

At first, my mind refused to understand what I was seeing.

Then it shifted, and the streetlight revealed enough for me to realize it was holding part of a human body.

I didn’t scream. I couldn’t move. My entire body locked in place as if instinct itself had shut me down.

The thing was eating.

Its mouth tore into the lower half of the body with slow, deliberate movements. Something dark dripped from its mouth, trailing down its chin and chest.

And then—

It stopped.

Slowly, impossibly slowly, its head turned.

Toward me.

Our eyes met.

Its eyes glowed red, streaked and glossy, locked onto mine with terrifying focus. It bared its teeth—long, sharp, too many of them—and smiled.

The smile stretched far wider than any human mouth ever could. From one side of its face to the other.

Something wet still clung to its teeth.

In that moment, I knew.

It could see me.

I don’t remember closing the curtain. I don’t remember getting into bed. I don’t remember sleeping.

The next morning, the neighborhood group chat was flooded with messages.

Someone was missing.

It was Marie.

The police said there were no signs of forced entry. No blood. No struggle. She had simply vanished during the night.

No one mentioned the warning anymore. No one talked about the noises. The group chat went quiet, as if everyone had silently agreed to forget.

I haven’t told anyone what I saw.

But sometimes, late at night, I hear movement above my ceiling again.

And now I know the worst part isn’t that I saw it.

It’s that it saw me too.

And I don’t know if I’ll be as lucky next time.
