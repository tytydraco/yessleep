I'm currently writing this in the hospital still recovering from my concussion from the night earlier. I'm writing this to get answers, I need to know who or **what** tried to me strangle me. I hope someone here will give me an answer.   


For context around our son, he was just a 3 month old baby (Benjamin) who had suddenly passed away due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Of course, me and my wife were grieving, this was the 2nd time this happened, just in the span of 2 years. I never got over it, neither did my wife.   


But our son *came back.* Not as in like suddenly rising up from the grave like a zombie or something.. Some entity was posing as Benjamin. I don't know if it was a demon or something but I have *never* prayed to God more than I have until now.   


A very loud, high pitched wailing penetrated the silence of the hallway, seemingly continuing on with no end. I was the first to wake up, my brain about 90% asleep. I check the time on my phone, the light blinding me for a few moments as if I was in a staring competition with the Sun. Half past 2 in the morning. As my brain was turning on, I decided to investigate the high pitched wailing sound. It was increasing in volume. I stumble across the hallway, groaning as I make my way towards the door on the right where the wailing sound was coming from.   


"Cmon Benjamin, it's nighty time, whatcha cryin about?" I mutter to myself as I get closer. In hindsight, I should have realised how inhuman the wailing sound was. It didn't sound like a baby. It sounded like something attempting to become a baby, like it was morphing into one.  


I peek into the room. Through the darkness, I could see a small dark blob in the middle of the crib, wailing at inhumane volume. I quickly attempt to shush Benjamin, cradling him into my arms, attempting to calm Benjamin down. As I do so, I could have sworn there was like.. a thing? I don't know how to explain its appearance but it looked like a humanoid body thing without a head. It didn't have a head but it had eyes, tongue, brain etc without the flesh. It was looking at me from behind the door before disappearing behind the corner.  


That's also when Benjamin disappeared.   


It sounds crazy, but both the weird entity thing and Benjamin just... vanished. So did the crib. I was just standing in the middle of an empty room in the darkness and I was just perplexed and stood there for a moment. Had everything been a dream? Had I been sleep walking? I didn't know at the time, my brain not having enough thought capacity to recognise.  


Eventually, I decided head back to bed.   
Though, as I was heading back to bed, I felt slow. You know when you're trying to run in a dream yet you can't and instead it feels like you're swimming? It felt like that. Except I was also struggling to breathe. I could sense something behind me. Like a demon or an entity with malicious intent. I sensed it get closer and closer behind me and I felt something inside the skin of my neck slithering down like a piece of chain-link fence. I was going to die. I tried to pull off whatever was inside my skin, but it didn't feel like there was anything there yet there was and I could sense something was choking me yet I couldn't as there wasn't anything behind me but it felt like there was  


I tried to force whatever's grasp off of me and everything was getting darker. I was fighting my life against an invisible force.  


"M-Micheal? W-hats happeni-" My wife came out of the bedroom and screamed.   
As I was shaking around, trying to get this thing's hands off from my neck, I could hear my wife hitting the floor.  


At this point, I was losing so much oxygen to the point where I couldn't fight back at whatever this entity was. I fainted before waking up on a hospital bed with several nurses and doctors around me.  


My neighbours called the police after screaming was reported. My wife was found dead, both eyes missing. I was found half-dead, lying on the floor of the bathroom. Apparently, I had banged my head quite severely on the sink. The police didn't find any evidence of any break-ins, nor any footprints, handprints, etc. It's a miracle I managed to even survive.  


As I finish up writing this post, I have just realised we never even had a child called Benjamin.
