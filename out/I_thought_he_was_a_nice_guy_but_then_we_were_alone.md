The Full Worm Moon.

The Algonquins used to call Ontario their home before it was “discovered.” Now the land and so many of its names have been repurposed by those who think that stealing an idea makes them the best people to teach those who have been robbed. 

“But why a ‘worm’ moon?” I asked Hugh. 

He reached out and tucked a lock of hair behind my ear. I leaned into it because I know that he likes it, the same way that he likes explaining things as though I didn’t already know. “The earth is finally soft enough to herald the oncoming Spring. Things that were dead will be alive again,” he whispered, looking up at the pitch-black sky. “The worms know this before everyone, because we all end up as the greatest delicacy a worm can crave.” His face was alabaster in the moonlight. Hugh licked his lips. 

“Is that why you wanted a midnight picnic?” I asked with half a smile. 

He huffed. “It’s because we’re seeing something beautiful, Olivia. In two weeks, the greatest celestial dance will cause a solar eclipse-”

“Which is why there’s a lunar eclipse tonight, at the full moon,” I finished dreamily.

Hugh barred his teeth. “Is there a reason you needed to interrupt my story, *Olivia*?” 

I turned away, suddenly uncomfortable. “I was just making conversation, Hugh. Look, it’s getting late, and-”

He wrapped a hand around the back of my neck, and I froze as chills ran up and down my spine. “No one around but the two of us,” he whispered. 

I licked my lips. “It’s very private.”

“No one around,” Hugh whispered as he lowered his mouth to my shoulder. “Did you know that a wolf can eat 4.217 pounds in a day?” Pulling aside my cardigan, he nibbled at my skin. I shuddered. 

Somehow, he seemed paler as the moon grew brighter. It was unnerving. But the way his tongue touched my skin was…

Painful.

“OW. Hugh, what are you doing to my shoulder, that’s – OUCH! Fuck, Hugh, what the-”

Then he pulled back, and it wasn’t Hugh.

Or, more horrifyingly, it *was* him. Sort of. Those same pinkish eyes looked back at me beneath facial hair that had sprouted up to his lashes. His long face, always gaunt, was now freakishly out of proportion with a jaw that fell to the middle of his chest, revealing long, sharp, yellow teeth. 

I froze in utter horror as the wolf pressed his claws into my arms. He was on top of me before I could resist, his nose now extended into a lupine snout that sniffed hungrily at my neck. 

I was pinned. The terror had overwhelmed me so quickly that the fight was over before I could understand what was happening. I stared up at the beast, unable to move, unable to process the fact that I was about to experience my final sensory input before the lights went out.

Then it got darker. Just slightly, but enough to notice. 

“Arrrwwww?” The wolf whined. Then he relaxed his grip. Swaying back and forth, he felt lighter. Weaker. 

His face began to melt back into Hugh’s. Not entirely, but sufficient to see the man behind the wolf. He lowered his head.

And then I saw it.

A partial lunar eclipse.

The edge of the moon was weak as it fought against the earth’s shadow. What had been a bright picnic now got dimmer as the moon appeared lopsided. 

The Hugh-wolf stayed on top of me, but he wavered. 

That was enough.

I reached for my deepest strategy and used the most cunning move available in a pinch:

I kneed Hugh in the balls.

I was running while Hugh was still howling at the moon, his wails of agony rippling across an empty field that ensured we were totally alone.

Fortunately, I had driven us here. Hugh seemed worried about driving, explaining that he had a hard time controlling a car in the full moonlight. 

I would kick myself for missing that sign, but who takes such a red flag seriously?

I screeched my car into the driveway, stumbled out, and locked the front door behind me before taking a breath.

Then I triple-checked every door and window lock, pulled down every shade, grabbed my chef’s knife, and crawled into the corner of my closet. 

What was I going to do – call the cops on a werewolf?

No, the best thing to do was entrench myself in the darkest shadows from the moon, waiting until morning before facing a world that I would never see the same way again. 

I finally allowed myself to breathe. The fear and intensity of the moment hadn’t allowed me to process what was going on. How am I supposed to categorize a werewolf?

I shook my head. The important thing was that I was safe. Warmth spread through me, tingling my skin. I scratched my shoulder. 

Would anyone believe me? I had no proof of what happened. Would this come back to haunt me at the next full moon? My head spun as I scratched harder.

Come to think of it, there was no realistic way out of this. No one capable of helping me would believe that Hugh was a werewolf. I scratched harder still, my shoulder becoming raw, as I realized a fundamental truth:

The fact that people believe werewolves are a myth is a *very* strong argument that every werewolf encounter has been fatal. 

The panic came back full bore as my skin felt like it was breaking out in hives of anxiety; had I really escaped at all?

Then I looked down at the patch of skin on my shoulder I’d been scratching. The one Hugh had tickled with his teeth.

The one with a prominent bite mark firmly outlined in my flesh.

Panic shot through me as a patch of moonlight peeked through the blinds over my windows and crept beneath my closet door. I suddenly felt hungry.

Oh, so hungry. 

I knew that I would lose myself if I embraced the moonlight. But I can feel its call. 

So I wrote this and posted it with the strength I have. I hope I live [until tomorrow](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/).
