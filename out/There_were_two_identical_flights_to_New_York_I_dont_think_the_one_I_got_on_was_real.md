Airports make my skin crawl.

Not anything about the building itself, but everything that comes with it. The constant squeaking of shoes against newly polished tile. The sound of crying babies, and the murmured apologies of their parents.

And the smell, too.

The airport, in general, was a mess of various scents. Some pleasant, like freshly baked pretzels, and some not so pleasant, like the stench of body odour. It was a sensory nightmare, and I avoided it whenever I could. I was content with living the rest of my life in my little town, in the same country. However, fate had other plans.

One of my friends, Julian, told my mom he was heading across the country for school. She saw it as the perfect opportunity to get me out of the house. I applied, thinking my grades were too low to matter.

But, since God hates me, I got in.

The plan was set. Julian would've already arrived at New York before I even left, meaning he would pick me up the moment my flight landed. Before I knew it, the day arrived and Mom was dropping me off at the airport.

“It’s time to grow up, Marin,” Mom said, placing a hand on my shoulder.

After one final hug and goodbye, she left, leaving me utterly alone, gazing up at the sterile edifice towering over me. Before I entered, the smell of sanitation spray and coffee wafted through the automatic doors. I checked my watch. 3:30 AM. With a sigh, I entered the airport, my suitcase rolling behind me.

I weaved through families, businessmen, and employees alike until I finally reached a respite; a large screen with some dated software, displaying flight times. Scanning the list, I found mine: Gate 5, 5:00 AM, New York. I was granted a short amount of relief that was instantly dashed when I saw the flight below mine. Everything matched—same gate, same flight, same time.

Except for one thing:

Nwe York.

I frowned, squinting in the dim light. That couldn't be right. I knew the airport was old, but surely they wouldn’t miss such an obvious mistake, right? It was something so trivial, but it bothered me to no end. I hobbled over to a worker and alerted her of the error. She just blinked twice before snorting.

"First time?" She asked, and I nodded sheepishly. "Yeah, I thought so. Don't worry, I'm sure it's just a glitch. Nothing for you to worry about." Her tone was nonchalant, and I felt myself relax just a little bit.

She was right. What was I worrying for? The technology looked like it was made in the 90s, and the airport was built in the 50s, and I was worried about a simple misspell? It was just the nerves talking. And yet, despite repeating the mantra in my head countless times, I couldn't get rid of the feeling of dread looming over me.

I sat at the terminal for around twenty minutes, just watching the people around me and thinking about nothing. Eventually, the PA system came on and the automated voice announced my flight's boarding time.

"Now boarding Group A for Flight 5B to JFK International, departing from Gate 5." I looked up and saw a large gathering of people at a gate nearby. The crowd moved as one, shuffling forward like a line of ants.

I grabbed my bag, took a deep breath, and walked into the mob.

There was a woman who was taking the tickets. She wore the traditional uniform for most workers at the airport and wore a stoic expression.

"Ticket?" She said, holding out a hand. I handed her mine, and she checked it. Her eyebrows furrowed for a moment. My heart stopped. Were there problems with my ticket? Was she going to ask me to step aside? She checked the screen again, then at me, before nodding once and stamping my ticket. I breathed a sigh of relief. The line progressed slowly until finally, I was on the plane.

It was... not what I was expecting. I've heard many stories from my friends about airplanes being noisy, with people chatting away, or the sound of children playing with toys. It was dead silent. Not in a peaceful way, though. It was a foreboding silence, like the kind you'd expect from a funeral home. I was sat beside an older woman who, from what I could tell by my peripheral vision, was staring directly at the back of the seat in front of her.

I know this doesn't sound weird, but when I say staring ahead, I mean she didn't move at all, not even to blink. The entire time. And it wasn't just her, it was everyone on the plane, too. I couldn't see much, because the seats were in the way, but I could tell that they were all just sitting there, not moving a muscle. Out of fear of drawing attention, I sat just as stiffly, my shoulders hunched.

My other neighbour, a businessman, settled into his seat with a sigh. He took out his laptop and opened it, the screen lighting up the area around us in an unnatural glow. Now being able to compare what a normal person looked like on the plane to everyone else, the oddities of the others were even more apparent.

As I redirected my attention back to my surroundings, my heart stopped. The older woman was now glaring at the business man. Her gaze was intense, as if she were trying to burn holes in the side of his head. The passengers in front had also turned around and were watching him work. My breath quickened as I glanced around the cabin. Everyone was doing the same thing; watching this man type away on his laptop, who was completely oblivious to the attention he was getting. When he lifted his head to stretch and saw the dozens of eyes staring at him, his face paled.

He didn't say anything, but I could see the panic in his eyes. He shifted in his chair, head darting from one passenger to another, before finally settling on me. I could see the question in his gaze; the silent plea for help, but I had no answers. I didn't know the rules, but at that moment I knew he had broken one. I just shrank in my seat, clamping my eyes shut.

I didn't dare open them again, not even when the man's typing had stopped. All I could hear was the soft hum of the engine. Nothing that indicated there was anything living or breathing on this plane. When I did open my eyes, the seat to my left was empty. Not even an indent of where he sat.

Now, I wasn't really the superstitious type, nor was I the type to believe in the supernatural or paranormal. But I also couldn't deny what had just happened before my eyes. Whatever the explanation was, something was seriously wrong. My mind was racing with questions, but I couldn't focus on any of them. All I could do was try to keep calm and remain still, careful not to let my breath get too loud or uneven, as it seemed like the smallest disturbance could draw unwanted attention to myself.

Suddenly, the screens that were embedded into each seat turned on, and I just barely managed to fight off the urge to gasp. However, I did flinch, prompting my neighbour to turn her head ever so slightly towards me. I froze, stared straight forward, and waited until she had returned her gaze back to the screen. Once she had done so, I let out the breath I was holding in.

A safety video started playing, which was strange since we had already taken off, but this was far from the strangest thing about the plane, so I didn't question it. It was a rather standard video, the type that you would see on any other commercial airline, with grey animated characters showing how to fasten the seat belt. I followed along with the animation and strapped myself in.

Click.

All at once, however many people that were on this plane also strapped themselves in with a unified click. I was off by a few milliseconds, but either those... things didn't notice, or were too distracted by the few stragglers who were off by several seconds. Others like me and the businessman, I assumed. Once again, the attention of the old woman and, assumedly, all the other passengers was focused on the latecomers. I didn't need to see to know that they too disappeared without a trace, just like the man next to me.

The video continued, and text appeared on the screen. I couldn't even read it on account of how many letters were mixed up. It was like a keyboard mash, and I couldn't make out a single word. But, somehow, I still got the general message: follow the instructions or face the consequences. At that point, I was pretty sure the consequences were death. So, for the rest of the video, I followed along with whatever it instructed, making sure I did everything exactly right, down to the second.

But it just kept going. Odd request after odd request with no rhyme or reason; press the call button three times, hold your breath for 10 seconds, close your eyes for 5... the list just went on. One by one, the remaining humans on the plane were picked off. A man coughed during the 10-second holding session. He was gone. Another person forgot to put their phones on silent. They were gone. A baby started wailing in the back while the mother tried desperately to calm it. I shut my eyes and willed the tears forming in them to stay, the lump in my throat to go down, and my heart to stop its rapid thumping. No rhythm that might set me apart.

The crying ceased instantly. They were gone.

Soon, I was the only human left on the plane. I like to think that maybe someone else was as good as me at following the instructions, and maybe they made it through unscathed, but I had no way of knowing. After around an hour, the video finally ended, leaving me with nothing but the faint droning of the plane's engine. For hours. I was slick with sweat and my heart hammered at a pace a hair's breadth away from bursting. My lungs ached, desperate for a deep breath, and my muscles burned from tensing up, but I dared not move.

The plane was just supposed to travel across the country, maybe an hour or two, but the flight had long passed that. Fear subsided, replaced with a numbing, all-consuming sense of monotony. The boredom was unbearable, so I tried to distract myself by counting the number of breaths I took, or how many times the lights above my head flickered. It was the only way to keep me sane. That boredom gave way to exhaustion, gradually wearing down my body until I felt like I could barely keep myself upright. My eyelids became heavy, and it became harder to focus on anything around me. I couldn't even tell if I was still in the same plane or not. Everything was starting to blur together.

I concluded that, if I were to die, then having it happen in my sleep wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. So, with that thought in mind, I let my eyes close and cast myself into the void of unconsciousness.

"Ladies and gentlemen, we’d like to thank you for choosing-" Static. "-as your preferred airline. We hope that you choose to fly with us again. Local time is 9 PM and the temperature is a nice 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Please enjoy your visit to Nwe York."

I was jolted awake by a voice crackling through the speakers, announcing our arrival to... New York. I had finally arrived. I forced the memories of the trip out of my hand, forced myself to ignore the empty seats around me, and the blank stares of the passengers, and walked out of the plane, rolling my luggage behind me. My heart nearly leaped out of my chest when I saw Julian's form standing in the lobby, holding a sign. I was nearly about to sprint towards him and give him the biggest hug of his life when I noticed something off about him. That big, dopey smile was gone. His face was a blank page, and his eyes didn’t spark with life, even as they met mine.

And the sign he was holding read, "Wlecome to Nwe York, Mairn."
