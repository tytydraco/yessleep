I have to get this off my chest, about 3-4 months ago, I was a huge pothead. Burning out in life, just living paycheck to paycheck, working at a smoke shop.

The pay was shit, but my coworkers were cool, and the money got me my fix. I used to drive around town and look for cool smoke spots, I had found a couple of nice ones. Off the beaten path of suburbia were some pretty deserted spots with nice views, a place I called Bunker hill, akin to a sand dune with a small pond on the other side, a spot down in the local creek where you could see the fauna of the town in their natural habitat, and then there was the burned out bridge.

The bridge was by far my favorite, it was an old, wooden bridge that as names suggest, was burnt and falling into the creek it crossed, all nestled back behind a power substation on an unmarked gravel road. There were concrete barricades on both sides to stop people from trying to drive straight out to the bridge, but that never stopped anyone. It was covered in graffiti, normal kid stuff, James was here, or Josh+Brandy 4ever and the like. Beer cans and cigarette butts littered the area, but it was quiet, solitary, and the only noises you ever heard were the cicadas and the birds in the woods around it.

It seems like forever ago now, I was having a bad day. Luck wasn’t on my side, work was shit, traffic even worse, and I hit every red light on my way home. I got to the house finally, rolled up my joint, and took off to the bridge to get some peace and quiet.

I should’ve known something was off though, normally when I’d pull to the end of the gravel road, I’d just stop and park, and do what I had come to do. Today was different, something in my gut told me I should pull around and face the car back down the road I had come. I told myself, “Just to make it easier when I leave.” I pulled it around, got out of the car, and the calm of the woods greeted my arrival, followed by the cicadas and birds piping up again in their songs, the engine noise always quieted them momentarily. Like a playlist that never stopped, just paused.

As I hopped the barricade and the bridge came into view, I lit my J and walked to the edge. I don’t know when the fire happened, but it started in the middle on the left side, damaging the wood enough to collapse it on that side, leaving a slanted, charred husk of a time long forgotten. The creek was about 15-20 feet below, looking straight ahead you could see the tops of the small trees that grew out of the hillside. I sat and pondered life while I watched the branches sway in the wind, it was so serene.

As I smoked, I could hear little twigs snapping under the weight of animals, the birds chirp, and the cicada drone, and in my haze of watching the birds fly through the tree tops, and the squirrels spiraling up the tree trunks, I wasn’t paying the utmost attention to when they stopped. All except for the snapping twigs. 

My gut twisted in instinctual fear once I had realized it.
 I stood up, as if I was just finished with the scenery, as to not alert whatever was out there that was stalking, and started walking back to my car, as I passed the tree-line, the bushes trembled, and I turned to see what made the noise. Hoping it was just a squirrel, I was so wrong.

Standing on the open path, was at first I thought to be a dog, maybe a coyote. But it couldn’t be, the limbs were too long, and it was draped in tattered clothes. My brain struggled to piece together what was happening, if it was a person, why are they on all fours? Who the hell would be out here like that? Did something happen to them, do they meed help? I didn’t have time to finish the train of though that would’ve lead me closer. It bolted forward, and I won’t lie, I probably sang like a soprano as I sprinted for my car. I ran and vaulted the barricade, hearing it slapping the pavement as it ran behind me. Fuck that thing, it could get its own help, I thought as I felt the thumps of it running, it was too heavy for its frame, like it was much, much denser than it showed. it was getting close, I was starting to hear its breathing, heavy and panting almost, it made every hair on my neck stand rigid, like my hair was trying to get away from what was to come. As I got to my car door it stopped, I didn’t, hopped in my driver seat and slammed the door shut, locking the doors as quick as possible and immediately checked the sideview mirrors. Nothing. Not even a shaking bush, nor a sign of that thing, what the fuck? Where did it go? I put the car in drive and floored it out of there. Not wanting to find out.

I got pulled over on the way back up to the main road for speeding, and I’ve never been happy to get a ticket until then. I told the officer everything I had seen and why I was speeding out from behind the substation. His brow furrowed in confusion, “you mean to tell me, some man on all fours chased you out of there?” He said in a disbelieving, and slightly condescending tone as he pulled down his sunglasses and looked back down the road. He wasn’t convinced.

“I know how it sounds sir, really, and I’ll take the ticket if I have to, just please! I need someone to check that place out!” I said in an uneven voice. He agreed, handed me my ticket, and said something into his radio as he tapped the top of my car. 

“You don’t have any marijuana in the vehicle right? It definitely smells like it.” Great. He thought I just got too high and freaked out. Maybe I had, but that things heavy bounds and panting breath made me believe otherwise.

“No sir, I’ll be honest, I was smoking down there, but it’s all gone now.” He chuckled.
Shit. He definitely thinks I just freaked out.

“Alright, well we’ll check it out eventually son, but for now, watch your speed and get out of my face.” He tapped the top of my car to let me know I could leave as he walked back toward his cruiser. I got home safely, but that image was still haunting me, why couldn’t I make out what it was? Was it really that far away? i had nightmares that night where it kept replaying over and over. I didn’t sleep much that night.

After that night, I kept a close eye of the end of that gravel road that butted up to the substation. I passed on my way to work everyday, and at first nothing, just a tree covered road, for a couple of weeks it went like this, I ended up getting an office job on the other side of town, I couldn’t even look at that road without thinking about that day. I think about it less nowadays, and my life has finally turned around, the new job, better money, no more smoking. But every now and then, when I sit on my back porch and relax, the playlist pauses, and the fear that courses through my veins is thick, like a tetanus shot. My fight or flight kicks in, and I spend the rest of the night peeking out of my windows, silently praying that whatever it was out there, will lose interest and finally leave. It hasn’t happened in a few days, only because I quit going out there.

If anything else happens, I’ll update. I just heard some scratching on the backdoor, I need to go let the dog in and get some lunch made.
