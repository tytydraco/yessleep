I can’t be the only one. Ever since I was a kid I would run up the basement stairs because I was scared someone was gonna grab my leg. I would be in a full on sprint all while trying to hit the light switch on my way up. There was always this constant feeling that something lurked behind me as I was coming back upstairs. In my childhood home “the game room” was in the basement. You know what kinda basement I’m talking about, TV down there, XBOX, board games, computer, pool table. Maybe it was me being a dumb kid but I continued to do it for YEARS. It became a habit for me. Go downstairs, hang out, play games, watch tv. The end of the night would come and my Olympic training would start. Turn the tv off, swipe for the light as I sprint up the stairs, and then shut the door. 



Obviously nothing ever grabbed me it was just that fear of what was lurking in the dark behind me that gave me goosebumps. I would love to tell you as I got older I stopped doing it. But I didn’t, I was a chicken and I’m not afraid to admit it. I slept with a night light until I was 13, I never left a closet door open when I went to sleep, and even as an adult I ALWAYS check the back seat of my car when I get in. 



My parents are retiring to Florida and instead of selling the house right away they decided to ask me if I had any interest in moving back in. The house is paid off so I would just have to cover utilities. I got a pretty good job right out of college and can afford it so I figured I would keep the memories alive and move in. The only downside to moving in is that I would be living alone. I did have family close by which was a plus but living by myself would be so strange. I lived with my parents until college and during my college years I always had a roommate whether I lived in a dorm or an off campus apartment. 



The night before my parents were moving out we had a little going away party for them. A ton of food and lots of drinks were had. My older sister lived a few blocks away so the entire family was there. It was a fun yet emotional night. I know my parents weren’t leaving forever and I would still see them but it still felt like a little piece of me was being taken on their retirement adventures. During the get together I pulled my mom to the side and asked if there was anything I should be concerned about when taking on the house. Any leaks, damage, problems or creepy spirits I should be worried about. I may have presented that last part as a joke but like I said I was a chicken and was just slightly concerned about how I would handle living alone. My mom assured me that there were no problems with the house and that once I got used to normal house maintenance it would be smooth sailing.



“Jason you have to keep the house clean, you no longer have the luxury of an unpaid maid. We just remodeled the kitchen not too long ago so all the appliances are new. My biggest worry with you is your laundry!”



“Really ma, my laundry?”



“Yes Jason! You would always let all your dirty clothes build up and when you would come visit I would have to haul all your bags down to the basement and spend what felt like days washing and drying them.”



“I thought you loved doing that madre , that’s why I would always save it for you.” I said with a big grin on my face.



My mom nudged me on the arm and walked away sighing and laughing. I hadn’t even thought about that. Not only would I have to be in the house alone, not only would I have to laundry, but I would have to go to the basement alone. I leaned back against the wall and thought to myself. What the hell am I so worried about, I am a grown ass man. This is the STUPIDEST thing to be concerned about. A basement? That’s my biggest concern, being scared of the dark as I run up the stairs? The thought alone made me laugh. It was ridiculous, I needed to grow up. The basement hadn’t gotten much use as I got older. I started to go out more and hang with friends and was barely even home. Then once I went to college my visits home consisted of eating homemade food, seeing family, and going out drinking with friends. 



The pep talk to myself ended when I heard what sounded like a stampede coming up the basement steps. For a split second I thought it was in my head until my nephew busted through the basement door. Breathing heavy and in near tears he ran straight to his mother.



“Joey! Are you okay?! What happened?!” My sister asked.



Still catching his breath Joey answered. “Mom there is something downstairs!”



“What are you talking about? Why were you in the basement?”



I interrupted “What did you see downstairs.”



“I didn’t see anything, I was coming up the stairs and someone tried to grab my leg.”



My sister’s husband told his son to calm down and gave him a hug. He told him he would go in the basement and check. While everyone else in the house may think he was just a scared kid whose imagination got the best of him, for some reason I…believed him. I can’t tell you what it was but I know he had the same feelings I had as a kid every time I came up those stairs. He felt like something was behind him. I would be lying if I told you I wasn’t terrified. I never told anyone about the little routine I had when coming up the stairs from the basement so nobody else seemed to be concerned. My sister was calming my nephew down as my brother in law made his way to the basement. I stood at the top of the stairs and looked down. I watched as he passed by the staircase several times looking around for someone, something, anything. He found nothing. He made his way back upstairs and he assured my nephew there was nothing down there and nothing to worry about. The night ended shortly after that. I said goodbye to my family and went over to hug my nephew. 



“Uncle Jason.”



“What’s up pal?”



“There is something down there, be careful.”



He gave me a hug that lasted a bit longer than normal and headed toward the door.



I was happy to have my parents stay at the house at least one more night before heading to Florida. After driving them to the airport I returned back to the house. I walked in the front door and took a deep breath. “This is it.” I said to myself. I was on my own in the house now. I turned the lights on in the kitchen and living room even though the sun was shining through the windows. It just gave me extra comfort knowing the lights were on. It was a safety blanket for me. I began to clean up from last night. Before I knew it several hours had passed. I got a phone call from my sister.



“Jay, do you wanna come over for dinner?”



“Tonight, uh sure I don’t have any plans.”



“Sorry about Joey last night, he was still a little shaken up even when we got home.”



“No need to apologize, I just feel bad he was so scared.” 



“He practically begged me to invite you over tonight so I told him I would, I think he feels a little silly about what happened.”



“Ah I gotcha, no worries. 7 o’clock good?”



“Yeah sounds like a plan, see you then.”



I rang the doorbell and almost instantly the door swung open. It was Joey. He ran onto the porch and hugged me. 



“Uncle Jason! You’re okay!”



“Yeah buddy I’m okay, are you?” I said with a not so subtle fake laugh



My sister came to the door and grabbed my jacket. She hung it up and made her way towards the kitchen. “Dinner will be ready in 5 mins, Jack should be getting home from Jenny’s soccer practice in a few.”



I took a seat the dining room table and I could feel Joey staring at me. Why was he so concerned? It struck me as odd but it scared me more than anything else. What the hell did he see in that basement? What did he feel? Jack went to check, no one was down there. In all the years I lived at the house there were no problems. Even though I ran up those stairs almost every night nothing ever happened. I chalked it up to me just being a scared kid. 



“Uncle Jason, did you go in the basement last night when I left?”



“Uh, no I did not. After seeing you run up those stairs I wasn’t risking it.” I smiled at him nervously.



“Ya know, I’m not scared of anything. I was just seeing what old games you had down there. I had the light on. While I was sitting looking at the shelves someone turned out the lights.”



“I don’t think anyone was close to the basement buddy.”



“I heard someone breathing.”



“What?”



“Someone was breathing down there with me. That’s when I ran to the stairs. I felt something touch my leg when I opened the door.”



My sister walked into the dining room with a big tray of pasta. “Foods ready!”



Jack walked in with Jenny and the kids went to go wash their hands. If no one could tell I was scared before they could sure as shit see something was wrong now. My sister asked me what’s wrong and I told her I was just starving. I ate tons of food and tried to clear my mind of what Joey told me. I asked my sister if she had any wine. I purposely drank a bit too much which caused my sister to tell me to just spend the night on the couch so I didn’t drive home. I took her up on that offer and crashed on the couch. I didn’t sleep much.



It was Sunday now. I didn’t want to be a burden to my sister and her family anymore so I said goodbye and headed home. I had work tomorrow and had absolutely no clothes to wear. I had to do some laundry. In that basement. I got home and gathered my clothes. I headed for the basement making sure to hit every light switch on the way. I swung open the basement door and made sure to keep it open. I walked down the steps with my giant load of laundry and threw my clothes in the washing machine. I started it and just as I went to turn around I thought I heard a noise. Without hesitation I headed for the stairs and sprinted up skipping 4 steps with every lunge. I closed the basement door and realized that I left my phone on the table. That sound I heard was my phone vibrating. I gotta relax. When my clothes were finished washing I put them in the dryer. When all was said and done with laundry I brought it back upstairs without any incidents. 



For the next few weeks I kept my visits to the basement at a minimum. I always had an uneasy feeling whenever I was down there. I always kept the lights on and never closed the door. Even though nothing had happened I certainly wasn’t going to take any chances. It had only been a short while my parents were in Florida but they wanted to come back for the weekend so they could see the family. I of course told my parents that they could stay at the house. This was THEIR house after all. We decided it would be a fun idea to have game night at the house. Game nights always consisted of good food, lots of laughs, and always I mean ALWAYS arguments. What can I say we were a competitive family. I grabbed my parents from the airport in the morning and by dinner time the rest of the family was over. Joey didn’t leave his parent’s side from the moment he got there. He was constantly looking around and listening intently to whatever sounds he heard. We played Uno, Sorry, and Trouble all the classics. There was one big one we hadn’t played yet, Monopoly. The ultimate argument maker. I teased my sister about how I use to destroy her in Monopoly and how she still owes me money from the time she landed on Park Place and quit. After some laughing I realized Monopoly wasn’t upstairs. It was in the basement. Once I relayed the message to everyone that I had to go get it, Joey ran over to me and told me not to go. 



“Please Uncle Jason, stay up here! We don’t have to play Monopoly!”



“Relax bud, it will take me 2 seconds I’ll be right back.”



“NO!” He shouted. “PLEASE STAY HERE!”



Everyone stopped what they were doing and looked over to us. Joey was clinging to me. My sister came over to put him at ease. I told him I wouldn’t go down and it was going to be alright. Without anyone noticing my dad made his way toward the basement door. He just wanted everyone to keep having fun. He figured he could go down grab the game and come back up before anyone even realized.



Well we did realize. We realized because we heard the basement door slam and my dad tumble down the staircase. I sprinted over to the door and had to wrestle it open. It felt like someone was holding it from the other side. I finally threw it open and ran down the stairs. Monopoly money lined the basement floor. The game must’ve flew out of my dad’s hand as he fell. He had a nasty bump on his head but insisted he was okay. I asked him what happened and he said he didn’t know.



“I grabbed the game and was making my way back up the stairs. I just wanted everyone to keep having a good time. I got to the top of the stairs and the door slammed shut. I lost my balance and down I went. I’m fine, I swear.”



I helped my dad back up the stairs and sat him down at the table. My mother was worried and insisted he go to the hospital to get checked out. She didn’t know if he was bleeding internally or maybe even suffered a concussion. I agreed with her and convinced my dad that he should go. As a family we gathered our things and headed to the hospital. I figured I would need the next couple of days from work off to take care of my dad and make sure he was alright. It wasn’t until we got to the hospital that I realized I left my phone back at home. I told my mom and sister that I needed to go home and grab it. Joey overheard is and pleaded to go with me. I looked at my sister and she shrugged.



“Please Uncle Jason, I just wanna make sure you are safe.”



When we walked in the door something seemed off. I left the lights on when we left but now they were off. I thought maybe the power went out but when I hit the switch the lights came back on. I thought maybe my mom hit them on the way out. I went to grab my phone from the counter when I noticed the basement door. It was closed. I know it was open when I left because once we got my dad back upstairs and we all agreed to go to the hospital we left soon after and no one went back towards the basement. Curiosity got the best of me. I opened the door. Just as quickly as I opened it Joey pushed it shut. 



“Joey, why did you do that I want to see something.”



“There’s nothing to see, you got your phone can we please leave.”



I looked at him for a brief moment and reached for the handle. I opened the door and saw the basement light was still on. I took a breath, closed my eyes for a split second, and made my way down. I don’t know what I was looking for but I was compelled to go down there. I heard Joey follow behind me down the stairs. I peered around the corner and saw nothing. Monopoly money still strewn across the floor but nothing out of the ordinary. I hit the switch with the light still shining from the top of the stairs.



“See, nothing to worry about.” I said as I turned around proudly smiling having conquered my fear. That’s when I looked up and saw Joey standing by the door. He never came down. “Who’s footst-“

The door slammed shut and the lights went out. That’s when I heard it. 



The breathing.



I blindly ran up the stairs hands stretched out in front of me. Reaching for that door handle. I grabbed it and pushed but couldn’t get through.



“JOEY LET ME OUT!! OPEN THE DOOR! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!”



I heard footsteps sprint up the stairs and I felt someone wrap their hands around my leg. 



The door flew open and I slammed it behind me. I heard clawing at the base of the door and leaned with all of my weight against it. I looked over to my right and saw Joey cowering in the corner with tears pouring down.



“Joey, were you holding the door?”



Through his screaming cries he said “No! I told you something was down there!!”



I grabbed Joey and we ran out of the house. When we got back to the hospital I brought Joey to my sister and immediately called the police. They came by to investigate the empty house and found nothing in the basement. It wasn’t until they came back up the stairs that they saw the claw marks on the door. Whoever, whatever was down there can stay. I’m not. That was my last night in that house, I don’t think I’ll ever go back.
