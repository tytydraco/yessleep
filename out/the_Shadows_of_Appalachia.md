i had just bought a few acres after my husband had passed and settled into what would have been our dream retirement home.

as i stepped out onto my porch, sipping my morning coffee, i noticed a lone deer grazing in my front yard. it's brown eyes seemed to lock onto mine, and for a moment, we just stared at each other. she was a beautiful buck. i brushed it off as mere curiosity, after all, deer were common in Virginia’s rural area.

weeks passed and i began to notice strange occurrences around my home. sometimes, tools would go missing, only to reappear in strange places. or i would hear whispers in the wind, faint but unmistakable. and then, there were the shadows. dark, twisted, almost human-like shapes that seemed to move of their own accord, darting around the edges of my vision.

on one a crisp sunday night, i was closing the curtains, and that when i caught a glimpse of the deer standing farther back than usual, near the treeline. it’s eyes seemed to gleam in the fading light, and for a moment, i could've sworn i saw something else standing just beyond it. a darker shape, tall and imposing, that seemed to blend seamlessly into the trees.

my heart skipped a beat as i spun away from the window, my mind racing with questions. what the hell was going on? why the hell is this deer behaving so strangely? and what the fuck was that other presence lurking just out of sight?

i tried to shake off the feeling of unease, telling myself i was just spooked, but the image of those piercing eyes and the dark shape beyond lingered in my mind. i knew wanted to get to the bottom of this, but did i really need to solve this mystery? as i turned to head back to my routine, i couldn't shake the feeling that i was being pulled into something much larger, and much more sinister, than i could've ever hoped for.

that night, i barely slept. my ears straining to pick up any sound that might indicate what was going on. just as the first light of dawn was creeping over the horizon, i heard something. a low, rustling sound, like leaves being disturbed. i froze, my heart pounding in my chest, as the sound grew louder. then, the window creaked open, and a cold breeze swept into the room. i spun around, my eyes scanning the darkness, and that's when i saw it. the same deer, standing in my bedroom, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light.

i tried to scream. my voice was frozen in my throat. the deer began to move closer, its eyes fixed on me with an unspeakable hunger. and, just as all hope seemed lost, everything went black.

when i came to, i was lying in bed, my heart still racing. it was morning, and the sun was streaming through the window. i must have dreamed the whole thing, i told myself…except i knew then that it wasn't just a dream.  i felt a shiver run down my spine. something was out there, watching me, waiting for me.

as the days passed, i found myself growing increasingly uneasy. the deer's nocturnal visits became a constant presence, a lurking shadow that hung over my home like a specter. i tried to convince myself it was just my imagination running wild, but the sense of being watched persisted. every evening, around dusk, the deer would appear in my yard, its large brown eyes fixed intently on my house. it would stand there, motionless, watching with an unnerving intensity that made my skin crawl.

i tried to shoo it away, but it wouldn't budge. instead, it would back away slowly, its eyes fixed on me. glaring at me. taunting me. i turned around to close my door and she was gone. it’s as if it had disappeared, but i knew that she would be back. and next time, i had a feeling that she wouldn't be alone.

i stopped going out as much. i didn’t look out the windows. i couldn’t bring myself to make a huge mistake.

sunday rolls back around and i woke up to the sound of rustling leaves and snapping twigs. i looked out the window, and my heart nearly stopped there were hundreds of deer in my yard, their eyes shining like a sea of lanterns. they were packed tightly together, their bodies swaying gently in the breeze. the deer seemed to be... pulsing, as if they were connected by some unseen force. when suddenly, almost.. as if in perfect synchrony, they turned their heads towards my house. towards me. i felt a cold sweat break out all over my body as i realized that i was the focus of their attention. whatever they were waiting for, it was me. i was left shaken, wondering what had just happened. was it some kind of bizarre animal behavior? or was it something more... evil?
as i stood there, trying to make sense of it all, i felt a creeping sense of dread.

months passed and the deer's behavior became increasingly erratic. they would appear in my yard at all hours of the night, their eyes glowing like embers in the dark. they seemed to be patrolling the perimeter of my property, as if they were guarding something. for a while i felt safe, but it soon faded and i became more weary.

it started to feel like i was under siege, with the deer gathering in my yard like an army of sentinels. i couldn't sleep at night, my ears just begging to catch the sound of their hooves on the grass.

soon, the leaves changed colors and september hit.

i saw something that made my blood run cold. as i looked out the window, i saw one of the deer approaching my front door. it sniffed at the threshold, its ears twitching nervously. suddenly, it let out a high-pitched bleat, and the other deer forcefully gathered in the yard, turning to face my house in complete unison. they seemed to be waiting for something to happen, their eyes fixed on my front door with an unnerving intensity.

as i stood there, my eyes fixed on the figure beyond the treeline, i felt it again. a sense of dread washing over me. the deer, still motionless, seemed to be waiting for something to happen, their eyes fixed on the figure with an unnerving intensity. a figure, shrouded in darkness, didn't seem to be moving. just stood there, its presence seeming to fill the entire yard. yet i couldn't make out any features. only thing i could sense, was its eyes on me..boring into my skin. suddenly, the lead deer took a step forward, its hooves clicking on the pavement. the others eagerly followed. their eyes fixed on the figure as they moved closer. a sense of unease growing inside me, as if i was witnessing a scene from a horror movie. the deer, now gathered at the edge of the porch, seemed to be waiting for the figure to make its move. i, on the other hand, was frozen in terror, unable to do anything but watch as the events unfolded before my eyes. i could only stand there, my heart pounding in my chest.

and then, just as it had appeared, the figure disappeared. vanished from thin air. the deer, still gathered at the edge of the porch, seemed to relax, their ears twitching nervously as they sniffed the air.

that’s when it finally hit me. i had to get out of there. i grabbed my keys and made a run for my car, not stopping until i was miles from my house. i looked back in the rearview mirror, i saw the deer gathered in my yard, their eyes glowing devilishly. i knew then that i would never be able to go back to that house again.

i’m sitting in a dennys parking lot writing this down in case they find me. if you ever find yourself living alone, near the Appalachian Mountains, don’t look further. don’t look into the woods. if you hear something, pretend you didn’t. save yourself and learn from my mistakes.

stay safe folks. i’ll try to do the same.
