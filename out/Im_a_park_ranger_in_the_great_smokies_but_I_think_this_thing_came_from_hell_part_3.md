The shower felt great and getting some food helped restore my energy. If only I could’ve done the important part… sleep. Every time I closed my eyes all I saw was that thing charging me. The smallest sounds in my bedroom made my eyes shoot open, knowing that thing was there coming to kill me in a most horrible way.

It took me the better part of two days to recover fully. Of course, mentally was another story. I’m not sure I’ll ever fully recover mentally. Being hunted by a supernatural creature that people deny exists isn’t something you soon forget.

When I returned to work, I wasn’t expecting a hero’s parade or anything, but maybe a little acknowledgment would’ve been nice. A ‘hey, we know you did your best’ pat on the back.

But instead, I got called into the boss’s office almost as soon as I walked through the door.

“Sit down,” he said while closing the door behind him.

His name was Raymond, but I only ever called him boss. He was taller than me, but thinner. It looked like he’d have to hold on tight to something if a good breeze blew his way.

“Well?” he said, staring at me expectantly.

“Well what?” I said wondering if this was one of those, ‘I’ll see how much you’ll tell on yourself’ kind of moments that parents and school principals always tried to pull.

“You know exactly well what,” he said.

“Umm, no, I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

He sighed like I was some child who had to have everything explained to them twice.

“Well, what happened out there?”

“Oh, I went searching for missing hikers but only found one. He was deceased.”

I sat back, happy with my brief explanation.

He pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration.

“Who told you to go looking for hikers?”

“That’s part of my job.”

“To just go on random quests like you’re playing some kid's game?”

“No, to help out a camper who said her family was missing.”

“Why didn’t you call it in?”

“I did. As a matter of fact, I got the call from this office to go investigate.”

“I’m not sure about that,” he said.

“I am.”

“I’ll check on that later,” he said avoiding my eyes.

“Look, why don’t you just come right out and ask me what you’ve been wanting to?”

“Ok, I will, did you murder that hiker?”

“What?” I said staring into his eyes waiting for the punchline. “Are you out of your mind?”

“It’s the only plausible explanation.”

I sat back in my seat, aghast.

“The only ‘plausible’ explanation is that I took some hiker deep into the woods, against his will, murdered him in cold blood, tore him to shreds, ate the lower half of his body, then dragged what was left of him back out of the woods, nearly dying in the process, so I could deliver his corpse to the grieving family and cover my tracks somehow?”

“Well, did you?” he said as serious as a heart attack.

“Of course not!” I said. “What kind of sick, perverted excuse for a human being would do such a thing?”

“Then who did?”

I knew I couldn’t come right out and say, ‘It was a Dogman’ or I’d be laughed out of the station.

“Some type of alpha predator.”

“Like what? Bigfoot?” he said with a look that was halfway between disgust and humor.

“You know what?” I said jumping out of my seat. “I’m gonna go hunt down the thing that did this, drag its bloody carcass in this office, and dump it on your desk.”

I turned and stormed off, nearly running over three other rangers that were trying to hang around close enough to eavesdrop.

I drove home in such a fury that I don’t even remember the trip. I packed my bags and equipment for a week's trip. I was determined to take as long as it needed. Finding it wasn’t the issue. I already knew where it was, the problem was getting back out alive.

I loaded my handgun, and shotgun with lots of rounds. I wanted to make sure not to run out like last time. I even bought sabot slugs for the shotgun, for a little extra power. I took my hunting knife along as a backup.

Trying to be better prepared this time, I hooked up my boat on its trailer, knowing I would need to get across the river. I put extra gas cans in it, just in case. Overall, I was taking way more than I needed. I stepped back and looked at my overloaded truck and boat.

I would say I was loaded for bear, but at this point, I was loaded for a pack of bears with a bad attitude.

Hoping it would be enough, I got in the truck and started down the road. For a moment I thought about stopping in and telling the family of the murdered father that I was going back to destroy the thing that took their loved one. But I couldn’t stand the thought of making a promise if I couldn’t keep it. Especially the way the boy reacted. I could see him or the brother wanting to come along, and I wasn’t sure I had the heart to tell them no.

In the end, I decided to avoid the whole thing. I would tell them after I killed it if I came back alive.

On that cheery thought, I turned onto Greasy Branch Road, heading for the Flat Branch boat access area.

The longer I drove, the more I realized it was no wonder creatures such as this lived out here. There were only a handful of houses for miles, and the place was surrounded by forest. Some say the world has been thoroughly explored and there are no more frontiers. Whoever said that never drove on a back road through North Carolina and Tennessee. There could be a predator ten feet off the road and you’d never see it through the brush and trees.

On that cheery thought, I tried to find a radio station to listen to, but the closest I got was some talk radio that fought through the static just enough for me to hear every third word.

I turned it off and amused myself by enjoying the early autumn leaves in all their multicolored glory. They covered the road as well. I was glad it hadn’t rained today. The leaves on the road turn slick as snot when they’re wet. Driving 40 miles an hour on a back country road was bad enough. I didn’t need to slide off into a ditch. No tow truck would come here to get me out.

It seems like I’m just full of cheery thoughts today.

I chuckled as I slowed to negotiate a particularly sharp hairpin turn in the road which told me I was nearly there. The boat trailer groaned in protest as I nearly doubled back on myself through the steep turn.

After straightening out, I was rewarded with the sight of a house. My mind reeled at who would want to live this far out in the middle of nowhere. Especially with that thing roaming the countryside.

Maybe no one lived there. Maybe the monster had already cleared out the houses in the area and had begun to feed on hikers.

As I wondered, I came upon a man out mowing his front yard. When he noticed me, he gave a happy wave.

So much for monsters terrorizing the neighborhood.

As tempted as I was to stop and ask him about the creature, I didn’t want to disturb his happy day of mowing with such terrifying thoughts. Being unseasonably warm, this would probably be his last mow of the season.

It didn’t take much longer to get to Flat Branch boat launch. When I pulled in, there was a pickup truck sitting there. I immediately recognized it as belonging to the dead man I’d brought back out of the forest.

Unpleasant flashbacks of that day stormed through my head. It seemed like a lifetime ago. It was hard to believe it had only been two days.

And yet, here I was, with my lousy paying job, about to face this deadly creature for the second time, if I could even find it. There was a chance it may have moved on.

But why was I here? Because I let my boss goad me into making a ludicrous and possibly impossible promise? Because a boy had lost his father in a most violent way? Or was it just to make sure no one else had to go through the same pain? Was it to make my little corner of the world safer?

Honestly, I didn’t know. It may have been any combination of those things, but I knew I was going to end it one way or another.

There was no boat dock, nothing to tie the boat to as I backed it into the water and pulled the trailer out. I had to put out the anchor to make sure it didn’t float away on me. That would’ve been a great start to my trip.

I pulled the truck and trailer into the empty space that was used as a parking lot and grabbed the rest of my gear out of the back. I had already loaded most of it in the boat before I left. Setting my backpack in the boat left just enough room for me to sit in the back near the motor. Looking over the full boat I thought of the old axiom, ‘It’s better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.’

I was definitely living that out with this trip.

Starting the motor, I headed west toward Wolf Creek, just like the last time. Only now I had a boat full of supplies and I knew what I was up against.

My fondest wish was to find its dead carcass rotting on the beach as I pulled up toward Wolf Creek.

Turning north, and coming to the place where I would park my boat, I saw no signs of a large predator rotting on the beach.

I guess I’d have to do it the hard way.

Pulling into the sand, I jumped out and pulled the boat up out of the water. The supplies made it much harder, and I started to rethink stopping and asking for some help to come along.

I dragged the boat across the sand to the tree line and tied it securely to a tree in case there was another storm like that horrible day. I didn’t want my boat to abandon me due to rising water.

I found the trail easily and started hauling loads of supplies up to Backcountry Camp 74. Getting a base camp set up was priority number one.

It took me four trips to get everything up to the camp. Fortunately, no one else was camping there at the moment. As much as a little company might’ve been nice, I didn’t want any innocent bystanders getting hurt. And hunting an alpha predator was a sure way for that to happen.

Once I was unpacked and the tent was set up, I took a short rest and ate cold. I didn’t want to start a fire and alert it to my presence. If I could sneak up behind it and blow a hole in its head, that would be just fine with me.

I wouldn’t want to see what kind of odds Vegas oddsmakers would give me on that scenario.

Having rested and eaten, I got my pack loaded for my hike. Aside from the essentials like a flashlight, food, water, and other necessities, I made sure I had my pistol with extra mags, my hunting knife strapped to my other leg, and my shotgun strapped to my back.

This time, I wouldn’t stop shooting for lack of ammo. It made the pack heavier, but ammo was the number one supply on this trip. I wasn’t trying to bring it back for some egghead to study, I was out for blood.

Remembering the things I never wanted to remember, I headed out to the west where I’d found the evidence of a struggle and the trail of blood.

I continued west through rough underbrush, hoping I wouldn’t lose my sense of direction and get turned around. That was the most dangerous thing for hikers. Getting off the trail and losing their sense of direction.

I’m sure a giant man-eating predator was the second most dangerous. And here I was searching for it like an idiot.

As I walked for what seemed like way too long, I was about to turn around and go back, when I saw the base of the mountain I needed to follow. It was a relief but at the same time drew me one step closer to my prey and our final showdown.

So far this had gone much easier than I expected. Even the birds and animals in the forest were singing and making their normal noises as though nothing was happening. It was rather disconcerting. Almost like I was walking into a trap.

I stopped and looked around, suddenly feeling very vulnerable. There was nothing I could pick out of the endless trees, just a feeling of being watched.  My hand drifted to my pistol and I held the grip but didn’t take it out.

The birds and animals still sang out their cacophony of forest song, but it seemed to be muted. As if the volume was slowly being turned down.

It was either my mind playing tricks on me, or the animals sensed approaching danger.

Standing there wasn’t going to get anything done. If I was going to hunt this thing, then I needed to shake myself out of my stupor and move on.

The first step seemed to be the most difficult. It was like my foot was encased in concrete. After that, the steps came easier and I resumed my journey on familiar ground, following parallel to the mountain, waiting to spot the cave.

I walked carefully, trying to make as little noise as possible. A sneak attack was still my goal.

Continuing on, a large shadow loomed in the distance. I had arrived at the mountain where the monster called its home. At least it did a few days ago before I broke in, stole its dinner, and blew several holes in it that should’ve been fatal.

I was thinking that would come back to haunt me very soon.

Clouds floated in front of the mountain as I grew closer. It took until I was almost standing at the base before I saw the cave.

Looking up, I made sure my pack was secure before starting to climb. This would be when I was most vulnerable. If the monster was in its cave and saw me, it could rain down boulders on me and end my quest for revenge without laying a finger on me. I would be completely helpless.

The thought buried itself in my brain so much that I shot furtive glances up at the opening almost every other step. I wasn’t sure what I would do if I saw the thing holding a boulder over its head, aiming at me, but I would at least know death was coming.

My climb continued unmolested. Until I reached the cave, I was a basket case of nerves. It took me a few minutes to calm down and get my heartbeat back under control.

Quietly removing my pack and setting it on the ground beside the cave entrance, I took a drink of water before preparing to enter. No use dying thirsty.

I unslung my shotgun and stuffed my pockets with as many shells as I could carry. I knew I was losing my stealth, but the extra firepower was worth it.

Pulling out 4 extra magazines for my pistol, I slid them in the back of my waistband, then took a deep breath and shone my flashlight into the cave, half expecting the monster to come rushing at me from the darkness.

Shining the light around the inside of the cave and seeing no murderous monster lying in wait, I took my first few tentative steps.

Flashbacks assaulted my mind of the last time I was here.  At least it wasn’t raining this time. Another memory asserted itself and made me turn around and retreat to the mouth of the cave and my backpack. I dug through it and retrieved a set of electronic noise-canceling earplugs, then put them in my ears.

The last time, firing my gun had nearly deafened me. At least I had learned a valuable lesson for this time. I stepped back inside the cave sincerely hoping this would be the last time and I wouldn’t have to learn any lessons to return anytime soon.

My memory reminded me that it hadn’t been long since I’d been here. I held the shotgun pointing toward where the light was shining. It would’ve been better if I had a flashlight mount for the shotgun, but instead, I had to hold it with the same hand I would need to reload with.

That had the potential to be problematic. But that was a future problem. Right now, I was listening intently for any movement but only hearing the shotgun shells rattling around in my pocket.

I swept the light back and forth as the cave grew bigger. I had arrived at the place where I found the hiker and had my battle with the monster.

As if to reiterate the point, I stepped on something that made a scratching sound. I moved my foot and looked down to find one of my empty shell casings from the gunfight.

My senses went into full red alert mode knowing I was in its lair. The last time around we had already seen each other by this point and were in a fight for our lives.

This time, there was only eerie silence that had the hairs standing on the back of my neck. I could feel it watching me, waiting for me to step just a bit further into its trap.

I stepped slowly over to where I’d found what was left of the hiker. There was still a dark stain on the ground where he’d bled out.

The memories flooded back, strengthening my resolve to make sure this monster never destroyed any more families.

As I stood there, thinking about the poor man who’d been eaten while he was still alive, I heard the faintest of sounds.

Instantly I went on full alert. I shone the light all around trying to get a bead on where it was before it could get to me.

At first, I didn’t see anything. And seeing nothing is much worse than seeing something, even if the something is terrible. At least you can point your gun at something, but not so with nothing.

The scratching continued to get louder as it eluded my sight. I was quickly entering panic mode. It was coming. I could hear it. I could feel it. The only thing I couldn’t do was see it.

Finally, my eyes caught a glimpse off in the far corner. It was hunkered down and slowly crawling toward me. I locked my aim on it and took a step forward.

It continued slowly toward me, but something was wrong. It wasn’t attacking. As I stared at it, coming closer, it sniffed the air as if trying to identify what I was.

This was all wrong.

There was no way that thing shouldn’t have already identified me and gone into full ballistic mode.

Something else seemed off. As I watched, it moved differently. And unless my eyes were playing tricks on me, it was smaller than the last time I’d seen it.

Then it hit me. This creature had both eyes.

It wasn’t the same one as before.

My spine turned to ice. There were more of them out here. It shouldn’t have been a surprise. I mean to think that the animal that attacked me was the only one of its kind was ludicrous if you really thought about it.

This one was hesitant. It continued sniffing the air as it approached me. Apparently, the larger one hadn’t told it about the intruder that shot its eye out and came close to killing it.

The creature came within leaping distance. If it suddenly decided it didn’t like my scent, it could make quick work of me.

My conscious spoke up for the first time and told me this creature was innocent. It had done nothing to me.

I hesitated, wondering if it was right. Did this thing deserve to die when I had no proof it had ever harmed anyone?

But then again, it was a wild animal. It didn’t get to nearly full size by eating berries and hugging trees. It was also an alpha predator, regardless of its size. It would grow and become just as dangerous as its parent.

And there it was. Could I really destroy a child, even a predator child?

My entire career had been about protecting people. Was this thing any less worthy of my protection?

It continued to approach while I hesitated in my mental vapor lock, unsure of what to do.

And then it happened.

The entire time it had shown no emotion other than curiosity. Now that it was close, it must’ve sensed my hesitation and even my fear.

It bared its teeth and let out a low growl.

In an instant my hesitation was gone. I knew this thing was a predator to the bone. It would stalk, hunt, and kill whatever it wanted to. The trails around the area would become its feasting ground. I would have to come out here again to deal with this thing, if it didn’t kill me first. Then someone else would have to deal with it. The slaughter wouldn’t end, it was just beginning.

It crouched.

I fired.

The sabot slug tore a hole through its chest.

I fired again as it yelped and tried to get away, but I had blown its front leg off.

I fired again, this time hitting it in the neck. Blood sprayed as it collapsed.

Stepping up and aiming at its skull, it looked up at me, panting, blood pouring from its wounds.

The impact hit my back like a freight train.

I rolled on the ground trying to catch my breath that had been knocked out of me. It took every ounce of determination to turn my head and see what had hit me.

There it stood over the wounded younger one. My nemesis. I saw the hole where its eye should’ve been. I saw the wounds on its body that had barely had time to scar, let alone heal. But most of all, I saw my shotgun lying twenty feet away from me.

It was all I could do to sit up straight and pull my pistol out of its holster.

In a flash the monster was on me, swatting the pistol out of my hand. It had learned from our last encounter too. Instead of waiting for me to take aim and dodging bullets, it took the weapon out of the equation.

It hovered over me, its putrid breath stank of death. There was nothing I could do and it knew it. I closed my eyes and focused on getting my breath back. It seemed futile when I was about to die, but I wanted to go out fighting.

When I opened my eyes, the monster was back with its child. Holding it like a mother would cradle a baby to comfort it.

As my breath returned, my mind tried to come up with some way out of this impossible situation. My shotgun and pistol were halfway across the room. There was no way it would let me just stroll over and pick one of them up. In fact, I knew if I moved the thing would be on me again. The only reason I could think that it hadn’t eviscerated me yet was to comfort its dying child.

To test my theory, I scooched over toward the shotgun maybe a foot only to draw the monster’s single-eyed glare.

Yeah, that wasn’t going to work.

My energy had nearly returned. The child wasn’t doing well. It was breathing in ragged gasps and coughing up blood. It wouldn’t be long now.

The only things I had were the shotgun shells in my pocket, the magazines in my waistband, and my survival knife. Where was MacGyver when I needed him?

I came up with a foolish, desperate plan that was sure to have me die a horrible death.

I slid my hand slowly into my pocket and grabbed two shotgun shells. At the same time, I pulled my knife out of its sheath. I only got away with that because it was on the far side of my body where the monster couldn’t see it.

Taking a deep breath, I threw the shells toward the far side of the cave. They hit the wall and clattered to the floor. It was enough to make the monster look for the source of the commotion.

In that moment, I charged like a wild man. I ran straight at the monster, catching it by surprise as I swung a slash across its throat with the knife, making it tumble to the ground.

It was back up in a heartbeat, about to charge me, when it saw my real objective. I had the child by the throat, holding the knife against it.

The monster growled a warning of the most heinous death it could imagine for me as I dragged the child toward the other side of the room where my shotgun lay.

My fear was that the child was already dead and it wouldn’t matter to the monster if I had it or not. But just as I was entering panic mode, it let out a little whimper. The monster stared death at me but kept its distance as I came closer to the shotgun.

It followed step for step, keeping itself within striking distance. I knew it was waiting for an opening to attack.

So far, my plan was working. That’s what worried me. I should’ve been dead five minutes ago.

The shotgun loomed a few feet away, just out of reach when the child acted out in a last act of defiance. It turned its head as far as it could, causing blood to flow even faster, and then it looked at me and bit my arm that held it.

I screamed in pain as the monster charged.

Time slowed as my brain kicked into overdrive and reacted. The monster was almost on me, claws out, aiming for the kill. Instinct kicked in and I held the child up in front of me as a shield. The claws drove into its flesh instead of mine. The monster’s look changed in midair, as it realized what had happened.

The force of its momentum threw me backward as it landed on top of its child and pulled its claws out. It turned to face me with rage dripping from its eyes, only to come face to face with the shotgun.

I didn’t wait. I pulled the trigger and sent a slug tearing through its neck. I had aimed for the head, but it ducked just enough to make me miss the clean kill shot.

It dropped and swiped at me, but I was already firing again, and hit it in the shoulder, making it tumble away from me.

I took the moment to load one more shell in the magazine and fire it. Then I loaded another and fired, backing it away from me and giving just enough time to load a single shell.

I kept moving as I fired and loaded. Making sure not to be an easy target. So far, it was backing away, taking hits, but not any kill shots.

When I reached in my pocket and came up empty, it knew. I had one more shot in the chamber and then I was out.

It charged, willing to take the last shot, when I bent down and picked up my pistol.

I threw the shotgun at it, confusing it as I began unloading rounds into it.

The hits were starting to take their toll. It wasn’t able to dodge as quickly as last time.

I emptied my first magazine and loaded another. Taking careful aim with the first shot, I hit the other eye.

It screamed like nothing I’d ever heard before, then turned and ran out of the cave with blinding speed. I tried to follow, shooting the entire time, but until I reached the mouth of the cave, it was gone.  

I looked down at the forest below, but all I could see of the monster were trees being pushed aside as it ran away.

There was no use chasing it right now. I knew I’d never catch it. Hopefully, it would run so far that it bled out and collapsed.

For now, I dropped to the ground beside my pack and reloaded my shotgun. Then I took a moment to eat a granola bar and drink some water.

Sitting there, with my legs dangling over the edge of the cliff, I felt like a kid again. Just watching the forest and wondering at nature’s awesomeness. But now I had to wonder if nature wasn’t trying to actively get revenge on humans with creatures like these.

After a long rest, I got up, slung my pack on my back, and started the long, dangerous climb down.

Making my way back to camp, I mourned the fact that I didn’t have the carcass to take in and slam down on my boss’s desk. Perhaps if I gave it a few hours the circling of turkey buzzards would tell me where the body was.

That thought made me smile.

The rest of the way back to my camp, I whistled a happy tune and glanced up at the sky from time to time.

\*\*\*

I decided to sleep at the campsite and get up in the morning rested to pack everything up.

During the night I had the strangest dream that my tent was being examined by a giant nose. I figured someone else had set up camp and had a dog with them that was curious about my tent. Hopefully, the dog didn’t try to mark my tent as its territory. I’d never tried to wash dog pee off a tent before and I didn’t want to start now.

I woke from a fitful sleep feeling not very rested.

Unzipping the tent, I looked up into the morning sky, hoping to see the turkey buzzards circling. I would delay packing up to obtain my prize of a monster carcass.

I stepped out of the tent into nothing but air. Falling into a ditch, I felt pain in my leg. I looked up at the tent suspended a few feet above me. Somehow a ditch had appeared overnight. I didn’t remember hearing it rain during the night.

As I wondered at the mystery and checked my injured leg, I heard the sniffing sound. It was exactly like in my dream. Suddenly I saw the snout of the monster appear at the top of the ditch and everything fell into place.

It had set a trap for me. It must’ve tracked me during the night, hence the sniffing, then dug a ditch in front of my tent in hopes that I would fall in and injure myself. Even if I didn’t, I would be in a place where it could easily strike at me without running away.

I lay there as still as possible, hoping somehow that it wouldn’t find me.

It was the most ludicrous thing I’d ever thought. If the thing had tracked me here by smell, how would it somehow not know I was lying helpless in the very trap it had set for me?

My only hope was to play dead.

The sniffing grew closer. I stayed still.

Peeking one eye open, I saw the snout start over the edge coming down toward me. I had nothing on me or in my pockets. My pistol, shotgun, and even knife were sitting in the tent.

The snout almost touched my leg. I heard a soft growl. It was getting ready to strike. There would be no jumping up and making a quick move to save my hide this time. I knew my leg was injured, but didn’t know how bad. With a homicidal monster bearing down on me was no time to test it.

In desperation, I felt around beside me in the ditch for anything that might help. I found a small stick and a rock the size of a fist.

As the snout came closer, I lunged with both, slamming the stick into one of the empty eye sockets and the rock smashing against the other.

It howled in pain as I scrambled out of the ditch and into my tent, grabbing the shotgun and whipping around, knowing it would be there charging at me.

But the attack never came.

I knelt there, feeling my leg throb with pain, waiting for the monster to come at me from any side. My eyes darted around, looking blindly at the inside of a tent, with no clue which direction the attack would come from.    

After a minute, my curiosity got the best of me. That and I couldn’t kneel on my injured leg any longer.

I pulled the flap of the tent aside and looked out, but nothing was there. I stepped carefully over the ditch and looked around the campsite. It was nowhere to be found.

Limping over to painfully sit on the log by the campfire ring, I wondered how many times I would have to kill this thing before it died.

I hoped it was thinking the same thing about me and was starting to doubt if it was worth coming after me again.

It had proved to me that I needed to finish this, one way or the other, this thing had to die.

My mind was overloaded trying to imagine what its next move was, and more important, what was mine.

Staking myself on a spit over the fireplace and waiting for it to come eat me in hopes it would choke to death was all my exhausted brain could come up with.

I sat there for a while until I came up with another plan that was sure to get me killed.

\*\*\*

It wasn’t long before the monster came back. Maybe an hour. It snuck up to the campsite keeping a close eye on the tent and the ditch. Only its eyes were its nose. It sniffed when it entered the campsite and kept sniffing as it approached the tent.

Half measures were gone as it leapt on top of the tent and landed slashing at anything and everything inside. Within minutes, there was no tent, only colorful shreds strewn around the campsite.

The monster came out of the remnants of the tent confused. It had torn something to pieces, but it didn’t feel the flow of blood or hear the satisfying shrieks of pain.

It looked around with its nose, only discovering the truth too late.

I had gone back inside the tent and changed my clothes, leaving my dirty ones in a pile on top of my backpack. I then took a quick trip to the creek and washed off the best I could, using just a little soap. I hoped it was enough to wash away my scent, but not so much that it would smell the soap.

When I got back to camp, I dressed in a fresh set of clothes and put on my belt with holster, and slung my shotgun. Then came the difficult part of the plan. There was a tree overlooking the campsite that had several branches that grew out of the same spot, making it an ideal nest. It took every ounce of strength and willpower to overcome the pain in my leg enough to climb the tree and set up in the nest.

After it tore the tent apart, I took careful aim with the shotgun and put the first sabot slug through its skull. The spray of red and the lower part of its jaw exploding onto the ground told me I’d made a good shot. But I didn’t stop to celebrate. I unloaded round after round into every vital organ. When I shot the gun empty, I took out the pistol and did the same thing.

It had tried to evade at first but had no idea where I was, so therefore no idea which way to go to get away from my attack.

It had slumped to the ground and lay still, yet I continued to pump round after round into it. When I had fired both my guns empty, I painfully climbed down and approached it.

I watched it for a long moment to see if the chest would rise or fall. It seemed to be still.

That’s when I took out my knife and sawed its head off.

When I first started, the body twitched, making me jump back, but until I finished, there was no doubt, it was finally dead.

I know I said I wanted to take the corpse back and plop it on my boss’s desk, but I figured this would be good enough. Besides, I was too exhausted and with my injured leg, I didn’t think I could’ve dragged that thing all the way back to the boat.

Standing there in the middle of the carnage that was once a peaceful campsite, holding the severed head of the deadly predator, I sighed. There was nothing left for me to take back with me except the guns, knife, and the head.

I looked into the empty eyes one last time, then turned south and started limping toward the boat.

Getting it into the water was quite an ordeal as well. It took a while and I had to rest in between, but once it was in the water and I was on my way back to the truck, I closed my eyes for a moment and enjoyed the cool lake breeze washing over me.

Loading the boat back onto the trailer was a struggle as well, but once it was on, I started the long trip back.

I stopped off at the cabin where the family had been staying to tell them that I’d gotten the thing that killed their husband, brother, and father.

But no one was there. They must’ve packed up and gone home. Can’t say I blame them. I wouldn’t hang around either.

I drove to the station and got my parcel out of the back. Limping into the building, the rangers looked at me with concern. A couple even asked me if I was ok. I waved them off and went straight to the boss’s office.

“Here’s your proof,” I said, slamming the skull down on his desk causing blood to splatter everywhere.

I didn’t give him a moment to respond before I said, “I quit.”

Then I walked out, emptied my locker, and was on my way out the door when I heard the call over the radio. Some hikers had gone missing out near Fontana Cabin, which wasn’t far from where I’d hunted the monster.

I paused for a long moment, then turned and walked out the door.

Driving home, I argued with myself.

In the end, exhaustion won the argument. I went home, got a shower and a hot meal, then went to bed.

I’d call in to the ranger station tomorrow and see if they’d found those hikers yet.
