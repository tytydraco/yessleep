I met my best-friend Jacob in the sixth-grade when we were both twelve. I was at a new school, and didn't know anyone. As an awkward, nerdy, acne-ridden kid, it was no surprise that I spent months on my own. My mom, worried about the early death of my social life, made me go to my school's middle school dance. As expected, I sat there alone most of the night, sipping Kool-Aid and eating out of what had to be the world's smallest bag of chips. That's when I met him. He sat next to me awkwardly and spoke muffled, almost to himself. He pointed to my t-shirt featuring a faded drawing of sans and said he also like Undertale. Not long after, we became inseparable. We would do everything together. My mom was so glad I had a friend, she let Jacob come over pretty much every weekend. It helped that she got along well with Jacob's mom, they'd often catch up for hours after Jacob got dropped off. Life was good, and for the last time in my life, I was truly happy.

One day after school, we found ourselves watching scary urban exploration videos on my Dad's old computer. We noticed that one of the places in the video was a local abandoned elementary school. Now I know how infamous it was, but all we learned from that YouTube scholar at the time was that it was shut down after a some kids went missing when the school was still open. It was then that we naively decided to seek it out and explore it for ourselves. We figured that maybe we could find something that nobody else had. It was a pipe dream that seemed plausible to our underdeveloped twelve-year-old minds. 

We began to set up our master plan after we saw that video. We decided then and there that we would make it to that school, and we did.  

We told our parents we'd be going down to main street to get some food after school one day. We lived in a small town, so our town's main street was a just a short walk away. After doing some research online, we found out that the abandoned elementary school was just past the woods behind the school which we currently attended. Jacob's mom was going to pick us up from the Pizza Hut in town at seven, and our school day ended at three. That gave us about four hours to get in, see what we could find, and get out. Instead of our school books, pencils, and notebooks, we packed our back with flashlights, extra batteries, snacks, and bottles of water. Most of which, would remain unused. 

Our school was so small, we were able to sneak away without any fuss. We didn't have much staff, and most of them were busy dealing with the hordes of middle schoolers, so two quiet nerds like us could sneak under the radar. We made our way out through the car rider line, and traced along the edge of the building out back towards the woods. The sun sat on top of the tree line, like a ominous timer reminding us to complete our mission before it disappeared beyond the horizon. 

We made our way through the woods, getting slightly cut up and itchy due to the underbrush. We made random howling noises to try and creep each other out, but just ended up laughing at one another. We remarked how we didn't see a single animal, not even a squirrel. We came across a few odd things as we hiked through the woods. 

The first, was a campsite, which we left alone as our fear of messing with adults was greater than any other. The second, was a rickety old deer stand. After daring Jacob to climb to the top multiple times, he caved and very, very captiously climbed up the handmade ladder. He made it to the top and his fear changed to wonder. He said in awe that he could see the school from up there. Before he got down he picked up a pair of binoculars off the floor of the deer stand. He pointed them towards the school and laughed, saying he could see everyone going to the buses, and even into some of the classrooms. I told him to hurry up and he took the binoculars and again, very, very captiously climbed his way back down. He pocketed "his" new binoculars, despite my hesitation, parading them around like he'd been a prospector who just found gold. Deciding I couldn't change his mind, we continued on our way. 

It didn't take long for us to reach the elementary school. Even in the daylight, we didn't notice the it until we came up face to face with it's brick exterior. The overgrowth was climbing up it's decaying walls, barely holding on to life. We made our way up to a window and peeked in. Books and desks were randomly scattered throughout the inside of the classroom. A shelf was lying on it's face, covered in mold and sitting in a pool of water that probably hadn't seen the light of day in decades. We failed to open the window, so we made our way down the side of the building. Eventually, we found a door. It was propped open with a cinderblock, and we quietly rejoiced at how lucky we were. We made our way in through the door and found ourselves inside what looked like the teacher's office. We giggled to ourselves- even though the school was abandoned, we felt as if we were breaking the rules by being in that room. We agreed to look around the room, which was for the most part, still intact. We found what we referred to as some "boring old documents" and not much more. Jacob found a mug that said "World's Best Teacher" and pretended to sip out of it. He laughed and remarked how stupid it is for someone to forget a mug like that. We shared another laugh and agreed to explore elsewhere. 

We made our way down the empty halls, a feeling of unease crawling under my skin as we roamed the empty, silent hallways. The inside of the building was a stark contrast to the outside. It looked relatively untouched by the oppressive forest just beyond the schools walls. 

Suddenly, a loud crash came from one of the classrooms behind us. We screamed and turned around, seeing a door open and slowly hit the wall next to it. We slowly inched our way to the classroom, Jacob brandishing a book he picked up of the book, ready to throw it at anything that jumped out at us. Jacob rounded the corner and looked into the room,  yelling something unintelligible as he reared the book back. He stopped, and said nothing was there. I came around the corner behind him, and there indeed, was nothing there. It was empty. The teachers desk sat in the corner, the desks sat in various formations, and there were even some toys and various utensils scattered along the floor. There was a large, metal filing cabinet that lay in the corner. We made our way over to it. As we did, we saw a small hole in the wall behind it. We threw away our fear and excitedly jogged our way over to it, hoping to find some hidden treasure. When we got close and peered in, we were disappointed. It was just a bunch of children's clothes.  

We brushed it off and made our way out the room, exploring a few rotting classrooms and supply closets as we made our way down the corridor. At the end of the hall, we came to the steel double doors that lead to the gym. We used our combined strength to push through the rust accumulating on it's hinges. We looked around the gym in awe. Even though it was an elementary school, the gym was much bigger than ours. Though long abandoned, we could tell how nice and well-kept it used to be. He dared me to race around the gym, and I agreed. After getting barely over halfway, I stopped, already out of breath. Jacob stopped soon after. We were definitely not the athletic type. We hazed each other for our lackluster performances before continuing our expedition. 

Once we got to the back of the gym, to what used to be the coach's office. The blinds in the window were still down, so we couldn't see inside. We tried the handle, and were surprised to find it unlocked. As we went into the office, we were shocked. It looked untouched. Like, literally untouched. A mug sat on the desk which still had magazines on it, somewhat neatly stacked together. On closer inspection, the mug had some water in it. It was clean, and clear. Jacob, who was exploring the other side of the office called me over with a childish giddiness coating his voice. Making my way over to him, I saw what he found so funny. It was a sleeping bag, open, and slightly ruffled. I still remember what he said. 

"*What kind of teacher sleeps in his own office?*" 

Our conversation was soon broken by a faint sound. It was out of place, and made our hair stand on end. Footsteps, and they were approaching us. Just barely noticeable, as if someone was trying, and failing, to sneak up on us.

We looked at each other, fear painted on both of our faces and our minds rushed on what to do. Jacob took my arm and dragged me to the supply closet at the end of the room. He shut the door, trying not to make any noise. As the door came to a close, we became submerged in an inky darkness. I tore off my backpack and nervously searched around for my flashlight with shaking hands. Taking it out I fumbled with the light, trying desperately to turn it on. I began to pace around, but as soon as I took a step back, I heard a loud, popping crack coming from the ground beneath my feet.

Then, silence. Loud, deafening silence. 

As I turned the flashlight on, I dragged it over to the location of the noise. A small leg bone sat beneath my foot, cracked and broken. I drug my gaze up and looked into the eyes of a small, decaying body. A child, not much younger than I was. Rotten decayed skin hung from the bones, which were stained a dark reddish-brown. There clothes were caked in blood and other indescribable fluids. The head was caved in, mangled and torn skin grafted onto the sick, rotten bone. 

The light began shaking in my hands, the body, although unmoving, looked as if it wanted to scream for help. It didn't scream, but I did. A loud, broken yell escaped my mouth. I almost didn't know I was screaming until Jacob tried to get me to stop, shaking me as tears fell down his eyes. He was quietly yelling at me, which was muffled and far. He grabbed my arm and bolted for the doorway, halting my screams. That's when I caught on to the loud, bolting footsteps coming straight for the door of the room we were in. Without hesitation, Jacob pushed the door open with all the force his small frame could muster. As soon as he did, I saw him. A large man stumbled back, reaching for us. As we pushed past him, he shouted something at us. Not a word, but a inhuman grunt that was more reminiscent of a monster than any human creature. I did not look back, and sprinted along with Jacob as fast as our little legs could run. Beads of sweat ran down my face, melding with tears and viscous snot. 

But something was wrong. I didn't see Jacob beside me. I turned to see Jacob on the floor just a few yards behind me, lying on the floor, clutching his foot. I screamed at him to get up when I realized there was blood pooling around his foot. He had stepped on a rusty nail, which had burrowed it's way deep into his foot, stretching the cloth on top of his shoe. He groaned and cried from the pain, trying to stop the bleeding in that fleeting moment. 

I tried to run to him but fear anchored me to my spot on the floor. The man, or whatever it was-- was running towards Jacob, and it didn't take him long to get to him. His large hand wrapped around Jacob's arm, ripping him off the floor. He screamed, kicking and flailing with all his might, but the man was like a wall of stone, cold and unmoving. I saw his face, warped terror and anguish mixed together, an expression that should've been alien to a child of his age. Then I bore witness to the thing that has haunted my dreams ever since that night. The face of the thing that took Jacob. Whatever it was, deep down, it was not human. There was no humanity behind it's eyes. 

I left him there to die. I could not face that thing. I turned and ran out of the school, back through the halls, and out of the teacher's lounge. I didn't dare to look back, not even for a second. I hadn't realized how quickly it had become dark outside. I could barely see, my flashlight bobbing and shaking violently as I sprinted at full speed in one direction. 

As I ran through the woods, I tripped several times and bruised the hell out of myself. Every time I did so, I thought I'd look behind me and see it standing there. But I never did. As I ran out of the woods and towards the school, I was lucky enough to run into the school's bus driver/custodian Mr. Henry, who immediately called the police upon seeing me in that state. He consoled me as best he could until the police arrived.

When I told my account to the police and our mothers, I lied. I told them we got turned around while playing in the woods, and I lost track of Jacob as we were trying to find our way back. I was too terrified to even think of that place, of that thing, let alone mention it to other people. 

His mother, a single parent, never recovered. She took her life a year after he went missing. After losing her husband just a few years earlier, the loss of her child was the straw that broke the camel's back. I just wish I told her the truth before she passed.

I never saw Jacob again. 

I'm only confessing this here and now, because they found his body. I don't know how, but when I turned on my tv this morning, there he was, on the news broadcast. He was mangled, bloodied, and defiled. His head was caved in, beaten into a dark void of blood and bone. He was nothing but a shell of my best friend. I cried, and cried, and cried some more. Then terror struck as I came to the most horrible realization of my short life. 

**He was sixteen when they found him.**
