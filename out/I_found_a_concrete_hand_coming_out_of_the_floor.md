I almost missed it.

The lot was just another dead space in the industrial estate—cracked concrete, weeds threading through the fractures, the skeletons of old machinery rusting under a sky the colour of old dishwater. It smelled like damp metal and burnt oil, the kind of place you passed through without really seeing.

But there it was. The hand.

At first, I thought it was a sculpture, some kind of urban art. A curled mass of concrete, fingers slightly flexed, half-buried in the dirt like something ancient trying to pull itself free. I stepped closer, drawn to the sheer wrongness of it. It wasn’t shaped like a statue—no clear chisel marks, no artificial smoothness. The surface was weathered, cracked, but beneath the grime, I could see something that shouldn’t have been there. A sheen, like skin damp with sweat.

And then it twitched.

A small motion, a shudder running along the fingers. I froze. The air felt denser, humming with some low vibration just beyond hearing. I told myself it was a trick of the light, a shift in my own perception. But I knew better.

It was alive.

I reached out without thinking.

The moment my fingertips grazed its surface, I felt it—heat, a pulse beneath the stone, like something deep inside was breathing. My stomach lurched, a wave of dizziness rolling through me, and I stumbled back.

“You don’t wanna be near that thing.”

I jerked at the voice, turning to see Ellis watching me from the gap between two rusted shipping containers. His cigarette had burned down to the filter, smoke curling from his fingers, forgotten.

I swallowed hard. “What the hell is it?”

Ellis exhaled slowly, not answering. He’d been working on this estate longer than anyone, knew every shortcut, every abandoned lot, every place to avoid. I followed his gaze back to the hand.

It wasn’t just sitting there. It was pressing against the ground, as though testing its grip.

Ellis flicked his cigarette into a puddle, watching the ember die. “Some things, mate,” he said, voice flat, “ain’t meant to be looked at for too long.”

I should’ve listened to him.

I didn’t sleep that night

I told myself I wasn’t thinking about it, that the weight in my chest was just exhaustion. But every time I closed my eyes, I saw it—the rough, cracked skin, the slow twitch of those fingers. The pulse beneath the surface. Like it was alive, waiting.

By morning, I had convinced myself it was nothing. A strange trick of perception, maybe some industrial runoff leaking into the soil, warping the concrete over time. The mind fills in the gaps when it sees something it doesn’t understand. That’s all it was.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had changed.

The industrial estate felt quieter. Not just in the usual way, where sound gets swallowed by the damp air and distant motorway drone, but wrong quiet. The usual small sounds—the creak of old scaffolding in the wind, the distant clatter of someone loading a truck—were missing. As I walked through the estate, I realised I hadn’t seen another person in nearly fifteen minutes.

And then I was there again. Back at the lot.

I don’t remember deciding to come.

The hand had grown.

Not by much, but enough that I knew I wasn’t imagining it. The fingers, once curled loosely, were stretching out, the palm broadening. The ridges and cracks had deepened, forming something disturbingly close to wrinkles.

I wasn’t alone this time.

A man stood at the edge of the lot, too close, swaying slightly. His clothes were stiff with grime, the kind of layered filth that came from months—years—on the streets. His head twitched in small, erratic movements, like he was listening to something just beyond hearing.

Then, without warning, he stepped forward.

“No,” I muttered, but he didn’t react.

His foot crossed into the lot. The air rippled, like heat shimmer on asphalt. He took another step, and his entire body jerked, his head snapping back so fast I heard the crack of vertebrae.

His mouth opened, but no sound came out. His arms lifted as if against his will.

He didn’t fall. He stretched.

His body elongated, blurred at the edges like wet paint running down a canvas. His limbs thinned, warped, the bones inside shifting with soft, awful cracks. His jaw unhinged, teeth smearing together into something shapeless.

And then—he was gone, like a melting candle.

Not disappeared. Just… part of it now.

The hand’s surface rippled. A new ridge formed along the base of the thumb, the same stained colour as his coat.

I don’t know how long I stood there. I felt weightless, detached, like something had severed me from my own body.

Then I heard footsteps behind me.

Ellis.

“Tell me you didn’t just watch that happen,” he said.

I turned to him, my throat too tight to speak.

His hands were shaking. His cigarette burned, unsmoked, between his fingers.

“It’s bigger,” he said.

I nodded.

“Then tell me,” he said, voice low, “why we still standing here?”
