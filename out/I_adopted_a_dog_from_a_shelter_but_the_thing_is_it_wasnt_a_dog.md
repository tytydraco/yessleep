Yesterday i moved into a new house with my family in a small town and passed a dog shelter, my daughter always asked for a dog and i thought it would be a nice surprise to buy her one now that we moved to a bigger house so i left my wife and daughter in the house and told them i was going to get groceries since the supermarket was next to the shelter. 

I arrived and one dog stood out from the rest, he was big, brown, hairy and had some eerily long limbs which seamed very off putting but anyway i bought him and took him home, i opened the door and when my 5 year old daughter saw the dog she ran as fast as she could to hug it and the dog walked towards her very weirdly if as it was difficult for him to walk, Later that day i installed some cameras around the house for security while my daughter was playing with the dog.

My daughter decided to call it bingo which i thought was a nice name and fit him. Later that night i put my daughter to sleep and my wife and i came to bed idk why i kept thinking about the dogs long arms and legs and eventually i fell asleep, In the middle of the night i woke up to the sound of something moving around the house and checked the security cameras,everything seemed fine until i saw the camera to my daughters bedroom i turned pale and my blood turned cold when i saw bingo (the dog)  standing on his two legs staring directly at my sleeping daughter, i ran as fast as i could without waking up my wife and got to my daughters bedroom and i yelled loudly BINGO and bingo got on his fours and ran away weirldly into the living room where i put him in his big cage which i dont know how he managed to open, after i put him in his cage i went to sleep. 

The next morning i woke up to check on my daughter and bingo who didnt eat his kibble strangely, I thought nothing of it and left to work and arrived home late as i got stuck in traffic.

 As usual i told my daughter a bedtime story and put her to sleep and went to take a bath and decided to check the cameras in my phone in that moment i couldn’t believe what i saw and resisted my urge to scream out of fear there was bingo standing in two legs with one of my kitchen knives on his hand waiting for me outside the first floor’s hallway bathroom door i immediately texted my wife to lock herself in my daughters room with her while i jump out the window and call the cops, while the cops came i got in the house and snuck up on bingo and knocked him out unconscious, got my wife and kids and waited for the cops outside. When the cops came they bursted in the house and took out the house a very tall skinny man who looked like he was in his late fifties and a very realistic dog costume in a bag as evidence and we were informed that the man was named Johny Gomez, a serial killer who had recently escaped the mental hospital and that if i wasn’t awake at the time we would have all been dead.
