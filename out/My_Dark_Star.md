I don't move from the floor of the stone pit. The effort is just too much. I'm saving my energy for stupid things like staying awake and not dying. From the carved rock floor I can see sky through the wire gates they secured over the mouth of the pit.

In this hole in the ground I have time to think about intentions. My intentions might have been good, I’m a mediator. I help pissed off people find resolutions to conflicts. I’m good at my job, and my intention is to help. This time that intention will not change the results. My wants will not keep people alive.

It is the second full moon. I missed my check-in.  
  
There is little food. Once a day, a boy, a tween, about my brother's age comes to the pit with a small bucket and lowers the day's slurry of calories and liquid. It's enough to keep me alive, but not much else.  
  
When the morning light wakes me, I list what I remember about the compound. They took the bag off my head during the interrogation. I saw rows and rows of slapdash housing, large camouflage tents, soldiers, and others.  
  
I know the geography of the caldera and trees and plants. I know what to tell the State Department if I can just escape so they can get here first. God, I hope they get here first.  
  
I was supposed to call my brother two days ago.  
  
The cartels have become unwieldy governments handling the regional needs of their workers, families, and slaves. It's hard to know what to call the people I see. What category do they fit in?

There are children here.

Some families are on the outer edges of the caldera. I saw fathers and sons carrying bales of leaves. Women were bustling around with baskets and babies on their hips, and toddlers trailed behind like ducks. Occasionally a man with a rifle would step into the flow of people and point someone a different direction. The people are trapped here just as much as I am. The only real difference between me and the residents of this shanty town is that my prison is smaller and I try not to shit in the water.  
  
I can’t be here. There are too many people.  
  
When this assignment came to me, I wasn't worried. I've built relationships with monsters my whole life. I've come to terms with the cold, predictable capitalistic douchebags of business. I've interceded with people who seem to have minds as twisty as a barbed wire fence. I’ve calmed the monsters who look at the world like a puzzle that can only be solved by ripping pieces out of other people's flesh. I assumed this assignment would be more of the same.  
  
I was arrogant. I didn’t take enough precautions and people are going to die.

Sparks of confusion, anguish, and desperation light through my brain.  
  
There are two types of monsters in this world. The first type "chooses" extraction and violence. The motivations vary slightly but these monsters always take much more than they give. They have other options, but they choose a destructive path usually because it's “cost effective”. They are the cartels and multinationals or even the mom-and-pop that abuse and under pay and then complain loudly about how no one wants to work anymore.

To a lesser degree, there are sociopaths and narcissists. They have to live in a reality where they are the main character and they choose to twist, and manipulate. These jack asses treat people like paper dolls. They gather people around them, rip their self worth apart, and discard them.

The anxiety has been building for days.  
  
The second type of monster is a force of nature. They do not have the luxury of choice. Destruction, violence, and death are tied around their necks like a Kinsale cloak. They have no alternative. They are killers and destroyers, and no prayer, wish, or intention will make them otherwise.

They cannot choose to be different. They are what they are meant to be. They are what nature has designed them to be. They are inevitable.  
  
The desperation and loneliness is overwhelming now. It’s like a panic attack but far away.  
  
The cartel that kidnapped me, thought to use me as a token to barter with. Their thoughtlessness and greed was actually a summons. They summoned a force, a power, a Dark Star.  
  
I sense resignation.

Somewhere far away, a veil has been pulled aside. A force at rest is now in motion.

I should have been more careful and taken more precautions. I wanted to help. I wanted to do what I am good at doing. Was that wrong? Was it wrong to want more? Do my wants and intentions matter now that I know what the cost will be?  
  
There is a cold calm, and my heart breaks. Nothing can be done. All control is gone.

I wait for the destruction to find me.  
  
The pit I lay in is in the center of the caldera. This shanty town is built on a large stone bowl from a collapsed volcano. My cell is in the center of that caldera, the bullseye in a target.  
  
Over time, plants and trees have found purchase in a thin layer of topsoil over the volcanic rock. Just under the service, the rock is layers of black and gray. I am counting rock striations, and I feel the world change.

There is a weak force. There is a pull.  
  
He is near.  
  
I call out, but my voice is nothing but a whisper. I am weak and dehydrated.  
  
Falling dust changes direction as he circles the town.  
  
There is nothing to be done now. I'm too exhausted to run even if I could escape. I breathe, and I count through the panic. The guilty and the innocent are dying.  
  
This is my fault.  
  
A dark liquid pools at the lip of the stone pit. It spreads, bows, and drips. The splash against my leg leaves a red stain on the dirt and grime of my once-tan slacks.  
  
Blood pools and drips, pools, and drips. The thwack, thwack, thwack rolls to a trickle. The dark spill of life falls, and I lay exhausted and defeated in the center of the stone floor unable to halt the rising tide of blood.  
  
The pit steams as it fills.

Our link is tenuous. An imprecise tether that pairs the otherworldly with the weak constructs of humanity. That link, that imprecision will end everyone here. This is just the beginning of the slaughter.  
  
His search is methodical, spiraling gently inward, chewing around the edges of this dense and overpopulated shanty town. It is a spiral that will end in the center with me.  
  
I try to call out again, but my throat is so dry I can only manage a weak buzzing—a hum at most.  
  
The blood pours down. It foams, froths, and spills between the cattle grate and the lip of the stone pit I'm held in.  
  
I've grown used to the blood, but not the silence. Death and dismemberment are happening on such a scale that blood is sluicing into my prison, filling it, and yet the silence is only broken by the frothing and splashing. The torrent is strong. The thick liquid pouring from all sides and draping like a sheer curtain. But, there are no screams. There is no pleading. There is mercy in the efficiency of the moment.  
  
It hurts, but I force myself to kneel. I refuse to drown in this pit.  
  
The cooling lifeblood of thousands pools and creeps steadily up my legs, stomach, and chest. With an empty voiceless scream I raise my hands above my head, not wishing to touch it. I don't want to slick my hands in blood. I want my hands to stay clean.

This is my fault and I laugh at the absurdity of wanting anything.  
  
The blood is now lapping at the base of my neck. My food bucket floats in the pool of red. I think of the boy who brought me that meal, the wide eyes and dark hair. The little food I consumed leaves my body. It forces its way out of my nose and mouth.  
  
Can I swim in blood? Can I tread above it? Will I drown?  
  
I split myself. I become an observer. I detach just as he does. A separate thing. If I am to survive, I can no longer question or feel. I must act now and press the emotions and the consequences away. I press the thoughts, the remorse, and the scale of the death down. I press down the feelings and lock them away in the cold.  
  
In the heat of the filling pit I am cold now, too.  
  
Is he close? Is the end near? It's hard to tell.

I float in a pit of life taken. Pressing my face to wire grating, sipping breath through pursed lips.  
  
The dimming moon calls me back to my body. It is a bending, dimming light that calls me back. My little Dark Star swallows the light. His hunger is rarely satiated once it is allowed to escape.  
  
He has found me at last.  
  
Light collapses, folding upon itself as waves of emptiness and motion dissolve and resolve in the form of not a man but not a child. Featureless in this form, he is a void. He is an eyeless, mouthless noseless void watching me from the edge of the pit and from somewhere much farther away.  
  
Relief and worry fill my chest as blood fills my vision. I wipe the blood away, but I am weak and coated in the life of mothers, fathers, and children. My arms slip, and I slide under the surface of the red pool.

An involuntary gasp and a thick froth fills my mouth. I heave and choke and force myself to calm.  
  
Metal groans and pings as the cattle gates tear, the lid of my cage is disassembled, and a thought pulls me from the pool of my baptism.  
  
Thrown to the ground, blood and froth expel themselves from my throat and chest. My choking eases. I breathe again; I am alive. The only one left alive.  
  
The void that is not a man and not a child lays next to me. I blink the blood out of my eyes, and we watch the stars in silence.  


A habit from years as his sole caregiver and tragedies past bubbles into my mind and I hum to my brother. The ragged buzzing melody of twinkle twinkle little star fills the silence left by the lives my Dark Star has taken.  
  
We watch the emptiness and the points of light above us as he slowly comes back to me from that far away place.  
  
I look at my brother as I hum. He almost seems human. The void is temporarily replaced by a shell of skin, but his eyes remain empty orbs.  
  
Then he knows.  
  
I see him realize the cost our actions have taken.  
  
Again, the end of the void comes, and I console the young man trapped within the cold, uncaring force of nature, the child within the monster.  
  
His eyes are still empty and black, but his tears glisten on the surface of that emptiness.  
  
Do you see them now? The bodies, the faces of the masticated and torn. My brother, how many lives can you take until you break and take us all?

I hold my brother's wrist, close my eyes, and we breathe through the tears and the memories.  
  
You are a monster but intentions do matter.

I see your want. I see your regret. I see your isolation. My little Dark Star.  
  
I know your heart.

I will care for you.
