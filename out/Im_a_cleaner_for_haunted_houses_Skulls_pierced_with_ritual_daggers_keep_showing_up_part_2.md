&#x200B;

Xavier and I backed away from the lengthening, bone-white arms. The long, sharp fingers snatched at the air blindly. I saw smears of ancient dried blood beneath the claw-like fingernails. Dozens of these unearthly limbs moved across the room, the flesh stretching like taffy. Black and purplish splotches appeared on the bleached skin. I heard bones cracking and fluids dripping.

One grabbed me by the hair from behind. I shrieked, trying to turn to fight it off, but it felt like fighting a statue. I tried grabbing the fingers intertwined in my hair and bending them back, but the sharp fingernails stabbed at me. The hand writhed like an enraged snake, its loose, cold skin tightening around my skull. I felt a rising sense of painful pressure. With a curse, I let go and tried to twist and turn out of its grip instead. Warm trickles of blood ran down my palms.

Xavier wasn’t doing much better. I saw hands grabbing at his uniform, ripping at his shirt and pants. I felt more of the eldritch hands reaching around my arms. They were freezing, as if the limbs had been kept in cryogenic storage for the last decade. Another one tickled the back of my neck before latching on like a tick. I screamed, falling to the concrete floor, kicking and punching, a sense of mindless animal panic overtaking my mind.

They continued to pull at me. I felt the fingers around my throat tightening. I started gagging as my airway closed. The eyes above us began to blink faster, the pupils flitting back and forth as if excited by the prospect of imminent death. They gleamed with an insane, demonic ecstasy. The dark mist rippled and danced across the ceiling.

Xavier’s pistol went off, echoing crazily through the confined space. I heard another three shots in rapid succession, and then saw the pistol clattering across the floor in front of me.

Sheer panic ripped through my chest as I suffocated. My vision started turning black. My heart thudded loudly against my ribs like a caged beast frantic to escape. I heard Xavier whimpering and pleading with the disembodied limbs.

And then, like the voice of an angel descending through the clouds, I heard Big George’s voice at the top of the stairs. He called down, asking if we were in the basement. The grip of the ghostly arms loosened for a brief moment, and I took in a deep gulp of sweet air. I made a shrieking sound like a fox, pleading for Big George to save us. His massive bulk began descending the wooden stairs, the boards popping and groaning under his weight. I saw a shotgun in his hands. Without hesitation, he raised the gun and fired at the wall where dozens of arms slinked out of solid matter.

It gave a muted boom. I saw holes rip into the hands and eyes as the projectile spread. The arms receded into the walls, leaving fat drops of fresh, dark blood on the ground from their wounds as they went. The eyes began blinking faster, the ebony mist covering them like a funeral shroud as it thickened. Then they disappeared behind the veil.

Xavier and I found ourselves hyperventilating on the floor, looking up at Big George in wonder. He pulled out an odd-looking bullet from his pocket. I saw it had a clear covering with small white and silver pellets inside.

“It’s salt and iron, boy,” Big George said, noticing me staring at the ammunition as he reloaded the shotgun. “You’ve got a lot to learn about keeping yourselves alive. Good thing I decided to come down and check on you two. I knew this house would be a handful.” He shook his head ruefully, walking away without waiting for a response. I lay on the ground, amazed to have avoided death.

\*\*\*

I was fairly sure Xavier had wet himself during the attack, but I really didn’t want to bring it up. I pretended not to notice. Instead, I stumbled blindly after Big George. Xavier ran out to the van and came back in with a different pair of pants a few minutes later.

Big George had brought us all sandwiches and sodas. I hadn’t realized how much almost dying made me hungry. I tore into it ravenously as Big George sat there, lighting up a cigarette before glancing between me and Xavier like a disappointed father.

“Have I taught you boys nothing?” he asked us. I nodded.

“Yeah, I mean, I just started, so…” I said. He cut me off with a steely gaze.

“There are three things that will keep the supernatural at bay; three ingredients the spirits hate, even at a place with such power as this- salt, iron and silver. Although, since silver is expensive, you probably won’t be using it much,” Big George said, fingering his massive silver cross. I noticed he also had on multiple gleaming silver rings. He certainly had no problem affording as much silver as he wanted. He pulled out one of his special bullets and held it in front of our faces. “You will both need guns. I have a friend who makes these for cheap in all calibers: 12-gauge, .22, .38, whatever you need. It’s just large salt granules mixed with tiny pellets of cold iron. But the spirits hate it.” Xavier swore in Spanish.

“Why didn’t you give that to us before we came here?” he asked, his eyes gleaming with anger. Big George shrugged.

“I didn’t hear Caroline’s story until today. When I did, I rushed over here. If I had known beforehand, I would never have sent you two alone. From now on, when we clean anything associated with Dr. Satan’s crimes, I’m going to personally supervise you two, or at least find you some extra help. These mutilations are clearly drawing something evil in, something even I don’t fully understand,” Big George said, and for the first time since I had known him, I saw he looked flustered.

\*\*\*

Cleaning up the mess in Dr. Satan’s torture chamber was no easy task. The blood had hardened to a coagulated crusty mess. Small pieces of skin and gore still attracted flies and vermin. The place stunk of decomposition and blood. I could only imagine how his victims must have felt down here, waiting in the darkness and knowing that at any moment, Dr. Satan would come and saw off another one of their limbs. I shuddered.

We ended up cutting the steel tables from the cement floor to scrap them. The scrapyard didn’t look thrilled when they saw the scrap was covered in serpentine crimson stains, but they still took it for a slightly reduced rate after we assured them it was deer blood.

“What do you think of this Dr. Satan guy?” Xavier asked Big George as we drove the truck back from the scrapyard. It was already late into the evening. We had worked hard on cleaning up all the blood and gore from the crime scene.

“How do you know it’s a guy?” Big George asked in his heavy Greek accent, raising one furry eyebrow in an owlish expression of faux wisdom.

“Well, most serial killers are,” I said. “Especially in cases with this level of torture and violence. Even though Dr. Satan isn’t technically a serial killer, as far as we know, the difference is mostly academic and not practical. There were some female serial killers who engaged in extreme torture and violence, like Rosemary West, but it was usually under the direction of a sadistic male partner. Most female serial killers target those reliant on them for help, such as nurses murdering patients or caregivers smothering infants.” They both looked at me for a moment too long. “What? I like to study true crime.”

“Mostly what you say is true, but what about Elizabeth Bathory, Darya Saltykova and Madame LaLaurie?” Big George responded, giving me a confident smile. I shrugged noncommittally.

“I know who the first one is, but who are the other two?” I asked. He waved off my question with a shooing gesture.

“Not important, not important. Just bad people, women who liked to torture and murder in extreme and prolonged ways. They say Madame LaLaurie broke most of the bones in one of her slave’s bodies and reset them so that the mutilated victim looked like a crab. And she left the slave alive after,” Big George recounted, a gleam of interest coming over his eyes.

I had never known that Big George liked to study serial killers, like myself, but now that I thought about it, it made sense. He did own a business that cleaned up crime scenes and haunted residences, after all.

“So while it is unlikely a female psychopath is responsible for the extreme torture, it isn’t impossible. We could have another Elizabeth Bathory on our hands.

“And speaking of female psychopaths, tomorrow morning, I have a woman I want you to see. Her name is Katrina, and she’s a local witch. She may be able to help us understand some of the more bizarre occurrences lately.”

“Yeah, half-spider babies aren’t too out of line,” Xavier said sarcastically, “but once undead arms start reaching out of the walls, I think we’re out of our league.”

\*\*\*

Xavier picked me up early the next morning. I felt like I had barely slept, but at least I was making good money. Of course, if I died before my first paycheck, it wouldn’t matter too much. George gave us the address. He told us the witch lived far out off the beaten path in a thatched cabin with a round roof. It looked like something a medieval Russian serf might have built, he said.

We had traveled down a dirt road through thick clusters of pine trees for twenty minutes without seeing a single house before we eventually saw the smoke curling out of the witch’s chimney. For a while, I thought we were lost and just driving down random nature trails. The road had deep flooded grooves that the old van barely got past. With the engine whining and the tires squealing in the mud, Xavier eventually powered through the worst of it.

The woman’s lawn was covered in countless mushrooms. The branches of the pine trees had practically grown into the windows and walls. Red and white Amanita muscaria mushrooms shone in the dim early morning sunlight, next to far deadlier morsels of the pale white Death Caps and Dying Angels.

We walked through the overgrown trail to the front of the hut, trampling mushrooms and tall ferns as we went. I was about to knock on the ancient hardwood when the door swung violently open.

“Who are you and what do you want?” the young woman asked, raising an eyebrow at us.

When Big George had said she was a witch, I had assumed she would be an old hag with a hooked nose and a house full of black cats. But this woman looked young and beautiful. Her almond-shaped green eyes had a kind of sparkling intelligence. Her straight dirty blonde hair ran most of the way down her back. Her skin reminded me of the pale, translucent light of a full moon. She wasn’t wearing a robe or anything bizarre, either. I saw she had a shirt from some band called 13th Floor Elevators with eyes and spiraling fractals above a tie-dye background. The smell of cannabis and incense drifted out of the open threshold.

“You’re Katrina, right?” I asked.

“Who are you?” she repeated, not answering the question.

“We’re… cleaners,” Xavier admitted sheepishly.

“Cleaners?” the woman asked, wrinkling her face as if she smelled something bad.

“Yes,” I said, giving her a warm smile. She turned her strange, dreamy eyes towards me. They looked like chips of shining, green emeralds and had a faraway look. The look of a seer, I guess. I felt like she was staring through me rather than at me. “We’re from Big George’s Cleaners.” The woman scoffed, then sneered, her expression morphing into one of contempt.

“Is that supposed to mean something to me?” she asked condescendingly.

“Look, we had a long-term contract with another occultist,” Xavier explained, “but apparently, he’s… well… he’s disappeared. Missing person. Hasn’t been seen in over six weeks.” He shrugged apathetically. “And word around the area is that you’re one of the best occultists in the state. We’re not normal cleaners, you see. Most of our contracts are crime scenes, and many of them are haunted or cursed. We take cleaning jobs other companies can’t handle, jobs other cleaners wouldn’t touch with a twenty-foot pole. You are Katrina, right?” She looked at Xavier for a long time, frowning, seeming to look into his soul. He shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot, glancing over at me.

“Yes, some people call me that name,” she said vaguely.

“When I was young, people used to call me Fat City,” I offered. “I mean, I was really, really fat as a kid. Like two hundred pounds by the time I was eleven.’” Katrina looked like she was about to slam the door shut on us for a few long moments. She sighed.

“Are you done?” she asked in exasperation. “First, I want to see the contract your boss sent. If the pay is acceptable, we can go right now. I want to get this over and done with, so I don’t have to hear any more of your horrible stories.” She nodded towards me as she spat the last sentence. Then she turned and walked into the house without another word, leaving the front door open. Xavier looked over at me and shrugged.

“I guess we’re following her,” he said. We found her sitting at a table decorated with taxidermied crows, jars of herbs, wooden bowls filled with drying mushrooms and, on the shelves, many yellowed, ancient-looking tomes.

“Are you really a witch?” I asked Katrina. She looked at me with a smoldering fire in her eyes.

“Do I look like a witch?” she asked coldly. I broke eye contact and looked around awkwardly, trying to find a way out of the conversation. I didn’t see anything, so I looked down at my feet and answered.

“Yeah, kinda,” I said. She was silent for a long moment, then I heard a high-pitched, cackling laugh, like that of a hyena. I jumped then looked at Katrina in surprise. She convulsed with good humor, lightly hitting the thick wooden table with her open palm.

\*\*\*

After that, we received a call from Big George that we had another assignment. An earlier torture sight of Dr. Satan, a massive mansion on the top of a hill outside of town, had been discovered by police recently. The property had been foreclosed on by the bank years earlier, and though it had an alarm system, Dr. Satan had somehow disabled it.

No one knew how long he had used the sight for the torture and mutilation of his victims, but they had received a tip-off in the last few weeks from the psychopath himself. He had used voice-altering software and called from an untraceable line. Apparently, Dr. Satan was also a narcissist who liked to showcase his work to the world. He had apparently been frustrated that no one had gone to check on the house and find his grisly living art projects there.

Though it had apparently been used as an earlier sight for torture, he had kept the victims here longer, perhaps for up to six months according to the doctors looking at the incomprehensible extent of their injuries. The police had kicked the door down and found six people, all still alive. Like all the others, they had their arms, legs, eyes, ears, nose and tongue removed. Heavy burn marks showed where Dr. Satan had cauterized their wounds.

Katrina came in with us, and Big George said he would come to the site later on to make sure we weren’t dead. He said it with a wink, but I didn’t think he was fully joking.

Xavier pulled into the long private driveway of the mansion. It snaked up a small mountain. The trees had all been cut down in front of the house long ago to give a view of rolling hills and tiny houses stretching off into the horizon. The mansion looked run-down but not dilapidated. Grime covered all of its white walls, and the lawn had grown into a jungle of weeds and thorns. Yet the windows were intact and none of the walls had giant holes smashed into them.

I had bought a handgun from a friend of Xavier, some likely hot .38 pistol. Big George, true to his word, had given us each some of the bullets with the salt and iron scrapings. It didn’t do much to assuage my confidence. If I saw anything supernatural, I had a plan to run as fast as I could out of the house immediately.

Katrina looked up at the looming mansion, pushing locks of long, wavy hair off her forehead.

“There’s a lot of energy in this place,” she said, looking pale and nervous. “It’s like black auras are shimmering all around the mansion. I get a creeping feeling from this place, as if it were crawling inside with deadly snakes.

“I think that whatever Dr. Satan is doing, it is far more insidious than just a normal psychopath. There are ways to summon demons using the agony of torture victims, after all. It’s been done since ancient times. He may be keeping them alive so that infernal spirits can feed on their trapped minds, almost like food offerings. Except the demons’ sustenance comes from agony, hopelessness and death.”

“How do you know that?” Xavier asked mistrustfully, giving her a sideways glance. She smirked.

“I’ve never done anything like that myself, if that’s what you’re asking. But I do read a lot of books about the black arts. You have to know your enemy like you know yourself, after all,” Katrina said, her eyes turning cold and distant. “Alright, let’s do this. I’m not getting paid by the hour like you two.” A nervous sense of rising energy swept through my body. Though I couldn’t see auras and energy like Katrina claimed, I still felt something squirming deep in my stomach, perhaps an instinctual anxiety and revulsion to this place.

Katrina got out of the car, carrying a small black leather satchel slung around her shoulder. Xavier got out next. I followed in the back. I saw him nervously rubbing his calloused right hand over the pistol’s holster.

As we traversed the cracked walkway towards the front entrance, I looked up and realized that the giant mansion doors already stood wide open. It was as if someone was inviting us inside. The threshold seemed to stare out at the world like a dilated pupil.

“Why are the doors open?” I asked. Xavier and Katrina both looked up, seemingly interrupted in their deep thoughtful trances. Katrina’s eyes narrowed.

“Do you think someone is already here?” Xavier said in a quivering tone, immediately stopping short in his tracks. We all listened, but no sounds came from the dark entryway.

We walked forwards through the antechamber into a sprawling, open floor plan. The second floor loomed over us with its interior balconies and tarnished metal railings. I saw ancient furniture piled off to the side and covered in dusty white sheets. I had the crazy urge to fling the sheets aside and make sure no one was hiding behind them.

A massive staircase topped with an elegant chandelier made of thousands of interconnected pieces of sparkling glass met us as we crept forwards. Here, we began to see the first evidence of Dr. Satan’s crimes. He had apparently kept all six victims in different areas of the house, very specifically located and surrounded by arcane symbols drawn in their blood.

A blood-stained steel table stood in front of the wide mahogany steps, mounted to the polished floor by bolts. Nothing supernatural or eerie seemed to happen. I heard a shout from behind us, and I jumped, pulling out the pistol.

Big George stood there in the open doorway. The wind blew wisps of white hair all around his head.

“I see you three are still alive,” he said, lips twisted into an artificial rictus smile. “These scenes are quite something, aren’t they? The work of a true master. A very patient man.” Big George looked up at Katrina and gave a sly, subtle wink. “Or woman.”

A chill went down my spine as I watched him. I wondered whether the Big George I knew was just a façade.

“I wouldn’t exactly say that,” Katrina responded icily. “We just got here. I was about to do a walkthrough of the place. Would you like to join us?” Big George nodded eagerly, his eyes twinkling. It looked like he was repressing a laugh.

“I think the basement might be a good place to start,” he said. We started moving through the living room with its enormous bay windows looking out the side of the house. I peered through them at the thick, black forest that lay there. My breath caught in my throat.

I noticed something unearthly, a red pyramid looming above the forest behind the mansion. It hovered in the air, as if it were iron reacting to a magnetized ground. As the wind blew past, it descended and rose a few inches. Like a puzzle box, pieces of it spiraled, jumped, twisted and depressed. I watched all the thousands of interconnected parts with total amazement.

The entire structure had an alien feeling to it, as if the angles and geometry of its construction had come from another universe with a different number of dimensions. Arcane symbols from a language unlike anything I had ever seen flashed in all the colors of the rainbow, some emitting a glowing black light while others pulsed a bloody red. On the bottom, many shone with a sickly, cancerous green. Next to that, they lit up with a cold cyanotic blue. And though this happened months ago, I remember the sensation of drifting away, as if in a capsule through the emptiness of infinite space.

I felt like something spoke to me through the pyramid, as if its twisting and writhing pieces communicated some ineffable, divine language beyond the capacity of the human mind to understand. Someone grabbed me hard by the shoulder, and I felt myself shaken violently. I heard someone screaming my name from a thousand miles away. It came through as faint as the buzzing of some tiny bug.

A hand slapped me hard across the face. I started like a man waking up from a nightmare. I saw Katrina standing there in front of me. I looked around and saw Xavier standing next to me, wavering on his feet with glazed eyes. He looked stunned and confused. Big George was gone. How much time had passed? I couldn’t tell.

“It’s a trap!” she shouted. “Big George is…” But she didn’t get to finish. From the odd, otherworldly pyramid, hidden doors slid open. Harsh, dissonant grinding noises echoed through the trees, a sound that reminded me of the shrieking of tearing metal. A black, cloying mist reached out through the openings like a dark hand. It moved slowly over the sigils and spinning pieces of the pyramid, obscuring it with an impenetrable, oily sheen.

For a few seconds, nothing happened. I watched the open passageways with bated breath, my instincts screaming at me to run. Creatures from a nightmare flew and skittered out. They all had skin that shone the same dark red hue as the pyramid itself. Centipedes the color of dull rubies and the size of a minivan writhed, their many legs propelling them forwards in undulating waves as they skittered down the sides of the pyramid towards the ground far below.

Some of the abominations looked like a cross between a spider and a dragonfly. They flew out in packs, each creature a few feet long with a stinger like a medieval mace. Their tails constantly flexed and relaxed as they flew, twitching up and down. Dark, jointed legs like those of a brown recluse hung under their alien bodies. Wings composed of fine, ethereal strands worked furiously, blurring as the creatures gained altitude. The first of the pack emerged fully out of the mist towards us. Compound eyes glistening in opalescent whorls looked out upon Earth, filled with a cold reptilian hunger.

Many unearthly cries came from the nightmarish abominations. I heard cries like those of a dying woman that went on for an inhuman length of time. Others roared like dragons from Hell. Thundering shrieks and cries of many kinds reached us.

“We need to get the hell out of here,” I whispered, knowing it was already too late. The three of us ran towards the door. I kept wondering where Big George had gone. Through the front window, I saw his Mercedes still outside. I heard a wailing cry from the basement. Freezing in my tracks, I looked at Katrina and Xavier in terror.

“There’s someone still alive in the basement!” I cried. Katrina shook her head.

“It doesn’t matter. We need to get out of here,” she said, grabbing at my arm. I pulled away from her.

“I’m not leaving anyone here,” I said. Without a backwards glance, I sprinted towards the basement, intending to just grab whoever was here and force them to come with us before all hell broke loose. The cries of Xavier and Katrina followed me towards the steps. I didn’t understand how they could potentially leave an innocent person to die when the basement steps were so close.

The door stood open, framing a threshold of shadows. I looked down but saw no light. I tried to flick the lightswitch, but nothing happened. Sighing, I turned on my flashlight and began descending.

Big George stood there with a knife in his hands, holding a trembling little boy in a raincoat before him. A tall, demonic woman stood before them, her head nearly scraping the ceiling. Chains wrapped around her naked, decomposing body, biting deeply into her flesh. Pieces of gray flesh hung off in tatters. A human skull hung around her neck like some sort of Satanic pendant. With pure black eyes and a writhing mass of twitching black appendages rising from her head like spiders’ legs, she looked down upon Big George and the child. At her feet, I saw a skull pierced through its crown with a black dagger.

“You have done a great deed, my son,” the demonic figure said to Big George. He grinned, his wrinkled face lighting up with delight and amusement. “The ritual is almost complete. Give me the final offering, and I will reward you with the immortality promised.”

“Obizuth, as always, your will is my command,” he said, putting the knife to the child’s throat and pulling. I heard a suffocating scream welling up in my throat as a cascade of fresh, innocent blood ran over Big George’s hands and soaked the floor.
