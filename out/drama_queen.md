"She thinks she knows everything but she doesn't even know I exist" As these words graced the lips of Jeffrey Manson, he wondered if she knew how many life's she had ruined.. Addy Jacobs would wander the halls with her constant entourage of friends, always tormenting anyone who dared cross her path. She saw all the people around her as a lower class that would never measure up to her. And Jeffery was determined to make her pay.  
  
As he listened to and watched Addy's every move he gather information about her. For the pasted week he had watched her like a hawk. Never letting her out of his sight for more then a few precious moments at a time. He had her exact schedule engraved in to his mind. All he need now was the right opportunity, the perfect moment. The perfect time to make her pay.  
  
On one bitter and cold day in late August he watched her ease into the small alleyway she took home from school everyday. "I could do it now he thought. "no witnesses" he contemplated. "no in her house will be better more personal,"  
  
For he knew she would let her guard down in her own home. For this is where she felt most comfortable. He jotted a few more notes about her down in his torn up and slightly blood stained black notebook. Then he car felly put the book back into the breast pocket of his slightly oversized black shirt. He then quickly hurried down the alley just in time to see her fiddle with her keys and slowly let herself into her house. He herd the familiar sound of the dead bolt locking behind her.  
  
Standing on the porch hidden in the shadows he could here her call up the stairs " mom I'm home" Getting no response she made her way in to the kitchen. Where she grabbed a quick snack and then turned on the TV to watch her Favorite show.  
  
At this moment Jeffery knew that now is when he had to make his move. He slowly removed the vile of acetone from his pocket, and shaking with anticipation removed the cap and pored the entire content on to a soft white rag. He took a few moments to collect himself, and then he slowly emerged from the shadows and stepped in front of the massive oak door.  
  
"It's time he thought to himself. Time for her to pay." He raised his trembling hand and swiftlky knocked on the door three times, took a step back and waited. Waited for the greatest moment of his life.  
  
Addy heard the knocks on the door and slowly rose from her soft white loveseat. She quickly made her way to the front door hoping to see one of her giggly girl friends. She unlocked the door and flung it open. Before she even had time to udder the word hi. Jeffery had already grabbed her and pressed the acetone filled rag forcedly over her mouth and nose. She tried to scream but no sound came out. She begin to feel drowsy and quickly slipped into a deep sleep.  
  
As Jeffery watched her limp body fall to the ground and overwhelming felling of success took over. With adrenalin coarsening through his veins he quickly picked up her delicate body and begin to tie her hands together, He then bound her feet and gagged and blind folded her. He sat he limp cold body and the couch while he make the short three block run to his house where he quickly got in his old beat up car and drove back to Addy's house to retrieve his prize.  
  
He ran into the house and quickly picked up her body and placed her delicately in the backseat of his car. He drove the three blocks back to his house and carried her up the dark unlit hallway to his shabby disorganized lair. He placed her on his bed and tied her to it. He then got an old wooden chair from his kitchen and place it inches away from her. And slowly sank into the chair and began waiting. Waiting for her to wake up waiting for the real fun to begin.  
  
He slowly removed a razor blade from his pocket and begin carving an X in to his wrist as he watched his own blood drip to the ground below him he brain to think how sweet the revenge he was about to have was going to be, How great it would be to make her bleed. Make her feel the pain she had forced so many other to feel.  
  
He was determined to make her feel lower then she had ever felt in her life. If she made it out of this alive he wanted her to never make anyone feel like she had make him feel. For he had loved her.  
  
When he first laid eyes on her he had been enthralled. He had never seen a creature as beautiful as her. He approached her just to say hi. Bt she took on look at him and laughed in his face. That was the worst moment of Jeffery life the moment he swore to get revenge.  
  
Just as this horrible memory played through his mind for the millionth time he was quickly pulled out of his daydream to the sounds of Addy slowly waking up.  
  
"Oh my god he thought now I will get my revenge!!"  
  
Addy slowly opened her eyes but all she saw was darkness, her head was spinning. "Where am I she though" "as she slowly came out of her deep sleep she realized she was tied up." She then heard the faint breathing of another human in the room with her.  
  
She begin violently thrashing around trying to get away. That is when a hand grabbed her by the wrist and said, " Now Addy how do you feel? You aren't so high and might now are you?" the voice screamed at her.  
  
Jeffery then took her wrist and slit one long gash into it. He watched her blood drip to the floor and laughed as she begin to sob in pain.  
  
" Does that hurt?" he screamed inches from her face. She begins to sob even louder. " Addy your such a whore he screamed I loved you and you never even gave me the time of day you took one look at me a laughed in my face!"  
  
" Now you will feel the pain you caused me!!!"  
  
Jeffery slowly pulled out a long black knife already caked with his own blood and plunged it deep into her heart. He then removed her gag and pressed his lips to her. And right before she took her last breath he whispered into her ear" I would of gave you the world Addy I would of died for you but now we will die together"  
  
He watched he take her last breath of life. Them he took her hand in his and slowly plunged the knife into his own heart. As he lay there dieing on single tear escaped his eyeâ€¦. A tear of relief. For he was finely released from the hell he had lived in and he had took his love with him
