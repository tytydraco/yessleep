I debated posting this for a while. It sounds insane when I say it out loud, and I’ve convinced myself at times that I must’ve misinterpreted things or maybe had some kind of breakdown. But enough weird stuff happened that I need to put it out there. Even if it's just for my peace of mind.

So here goes.

This all started in **2019**, when I moved to **Chicago** for a new job. I was 28, single, freshly promoted, and looking forward to hitting reset. I didn’t know anyone in the city, and I liked it that way. New apartment, new job, new version of myself.

But within the first couple of weeks, something strange started happening.

The first time was at a coffee shop in Wicker Park — a place I had *never* been before. I walked in, just checking it out on my lunch break, and the barista smiled and said, *“Back again so soon?”* I said, “Sorry?” And he laughed, like I was playing dumb. He said, “You were literally here two days ago. Ordered the same thing — oat latte, right? Even sat in the corner with that big red book.”

That *was* my order. And yeah, I’d been reading a red hardcover at the time. But I swear to God I’d never been in that place before. I assumed he mistook me for someone else. I laughed it off.

But it kept happening.

People started saying hi to me on the street. Strangers smiled like we were friends. One time a woman actually hugged me outside a movie theater, calling me “Alex” (my real name) and saying she was glad I came after all.

When I told her she had the wrong person, she looked *confused*, then kind of scared. “Wait...your name is Alex G., right?”

I asked her how she knew that. She said we’d matched on a dating app a few weeks ago. That we’d chatted, gone on a couple dates. That I told her I lived near Logan Square — which I *do*.

I’d never seen her in my life.

I started to get paranoid. My first thought was identity theft. Maybe someone was using my photos online or catfishing people. I checked all the apps — nothing out of place. I even Googled myself, searched Facebook, Reddit, Twitter. I didn’t find anything, until one night I found a random post in a Chicago subreddit:

>

There was a picture. Blurry, taken from across the room.  
It was me. Or…someone who *looked* like me. Same brown hair, same black hoodie I owned. Same scar under the left eye — a faded line I got when I fell off my bike as a kid.

I stared at that image for a long time. I remember my stomach turning in a way I can’t really explain.

I messaged the poster. No reply.

A few days later, I got a DM on Reddit from a throwaway account. No name, no profile picture. Just this:

>

That was all it said.

Of course, I didn’t listen.

I started trying to find him. I looked at bar pages on Instagram, Reddit, Facebook. I found one place where he was reportedly seen more than once — a little dive on Halsted. I went there late one Friday night, waited around like a creep.

And I saw him.

He walked out around 2 a.m., and my heart *stopped*. He looked *exactly* like me. It wasn’t just similar — it was *identical*. Same face, same posture, same clothes I used to wear before I started trying to “rebrand” myself. Like a snapshot of me from a year ago, before the move.

He looked right at me. Didn’t flinch. Didn’t seem surprised.

He smiled and said, “About time.”

I asked him who he was. He said:

>

Then he just walked past me like nothing happened.

I didn’t follow him. I don’t think I could’ve moved even if I wanted to. I went home, shaking.

The next week, **someone filed a police report under my name**. Assault. Downtown Chicago. The date and time? I was *at work* — with security footage and card swipes to prove it. But I still had to talk to the cops. They didn’t say it, but I could tell they thought I was covering something up.

It didn’t stop there. A package I didn’t order arrived at my apartment — addressed to me, but from an online store I’d never used. A guy in the building swore I’d been talking to him about photography equipment. (I don’t even own a camera.) Someone emailed my work asking if I was available for freelance gigs — with *a different number and Gmail address* linked to my name.

I moved again in early 2020. Different city, different state. New name on my lease. I don’t tell people where I live. I barely use social media anymore.

But every once in a while, someone still finds me. An old coworker says they saw me “last month” in Chicago. A friend sends a photo and says, “Weird — thought this was you.” Someone emails me from a burner account and just types:

>

And yeah, I’ve wondered if I lost it. Maybe I cracked under stress and this is some long delusion. But I know what I saw. I know it wasn’t me filing that report or ordering those packages.

I know it wasn’t me that woman hugged outside the movie theater.

I haven’t been back to Chicago since. I don’t know what I’ll do if I ever run into him again.

But if you ever meet someone named Alex G., and he seems friendly, a little too familiar — like he already knows you?

Please. Just walk the other way.
