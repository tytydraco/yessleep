Disclaimer: Once, I told my therapist about how I often fantasized about telling people certain things that I could never get myself to speak out loud. He suggested I write a letter to them under the premise that I didn’t have to do anything with it; I could keep it, send it, or just destroy it. He said the point wasn’t to communicate something to them, just to let my feelings out, free of consequence. That is what the following text is, and it’s dedicated to him.

As such, note that it was written under a lot of emotional strain and a lot of its contents may be nonsensical or concerning. Do not think much of it, I just wrote what came to my head on the spot and it's unlikely to hold much meaning. Despite that, I thought I’d share it. It would make me feel… less guilty. But in a cosmic way I guess. I can’t really explain it.



>Hey monster, can I call you that? I guess it would be a bit unfair to, there’s no real reason to call you that. I just felt like it. Anyways, haven’t seen you in a while, have I? I might actually have to check heh. Time flies and all that. I’m just writing to tell you I’ve been feeling a lot better lately, I’m much better at liberating what lies inside me now. I do wonder how much of my improvement is thanks to the time I spent with you. Probably not much but, regardless, I’m still very grateful.

>Gratitude isn’t the only reason I’m sending you a letter though, there’s also just so much I thought about telling you and never got to. Because sometimes I would be swarmed by thoughts about you that were, well, let’s just say they were not nice. My confused stance towards you became dense, restless, and I now feel the need to “confront” you about it. And now, filled with an explosion of feelings I really need to open the cage and let it all out. And I insist, there’s just so, so much I never got to tell you.

>I never got to tell you about how unsafe I would feel as soon as I entered your office, how I would feel as if a lump of flesh grew beneath my guts and moved around, pushing against the edges of my skin, threatening to escape by breaking me apart from the inside. Now, I’m not accusing you, none of this is your fault, it isn’t even particularly real. All in my head, and before you ask, ‘cause I know you like asking that, nobody told me so, I decided on my own that it’s all in my head.

>I also never got to tell you about the hand. *Your* hand. But I suppose the reality is it was his hand. My hand? Just. A hand. Not like it matters anyways, it’s not as big of a deal as I’m making it sound. In fact, it’s a sensation you’ve probably felt at some point too. You know, this sensory hand print that lingers on your back or some other body part as if a ghost had touched you but, in reality, is just your brain playing tricks on you. That’s all it is, mundane experiences that I fictionalize to justify my shit, is it not?

>I never got to tell you, either, about how much I enjoyed it all. How much I enjoyed looking at you as you twisted your slender, malformed body along the couch opposite to me, your emotions swelling inside you, unable to manifest themselves. How I remember the gentle pressure of my fingertips against my pen as it awaited for anything worth noting down, as the only thing my hand actually wanted to be touching was something else entirely. But we both know, deep down, that it was neither you nor I, but him.

>And I really, really never got to tell you. Oh! How much pleasure I took from looking at how the robes sat upon your body. Oh! The way there was too much residual cloth flailing around, far out covering your limbs, inviting them to sculpt themselves along it and, in the process, bring your soul closer to mine. Oh! How abnormally sure I am that you’ll grow to be just like me.

>I wrote that, I guess.

>I’ve always had a very active imagination, did you ever notice? Did you? Did you ever think that I WAS INSANE?  ANSWER ME PLEASE! I KNOW YOURE STILL THERE, I KNOWYOUDIDNTGETOUTFORTHEWALLSTHATSURROUNDMYCORPOREALFORMCANNOTBEBROKEN.



Quite an abrupt end, I know. But it's just the last I wrote about it. I don’t remember how or why I stopped. Maybe I fell asleep or got distracted by something. All I’m sure about is that when I remembered I was writing it I didn’t feel like continuing it, so I just left it like that. Like I said in the disclaimer at the start, all of this may have you worrying about my well-being. If that describes you, know this:



I’m fine.



And, from now onwards, I will forever be.
