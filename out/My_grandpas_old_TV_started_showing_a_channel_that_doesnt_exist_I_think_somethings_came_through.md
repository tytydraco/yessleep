Hey. I don’t usually post stuff like this, and I’m honestly not even sure what I’m trying to get out of telling it. Maybe I just need to know I’m not losing it.

This happened a little over a week ago. My grandpa passed away in May, and I’ve been helping my mom clean out his house. He lived alone in this creaky place at the edge of some woods in central PA — the kind of house that still smells like pipe smoke and old wood, even though he quit smoking years ago.

Anyway, he was always kind of eccentric. Big on routines, superstitious in a weird, quiet way. He’d put salt above the doorframes. Never let clocks stop. Little stuff like that. But toward the end, he started getting… stranger. Talking to himself. Writing little notes and taping them around the house. A bunch of them just said things like “DO NOT OPEN” or “KEEP CLOSED.”

There was one note in particular that always stuck with me. He’d taped it over the screen of his old TV with like, five layers of duct tape. Big block letters in black Sharpie:

“DO NOT TURN TO CHANNEL 103.”

I joked about it once — asked him if he was hiding porn or something. He looked me dead in the eye and said, “It doesn’t show you anything you want to see.” Then he just changed the subject.

Fast-forward to last week. I’m at his place alone overnight, going through boxes, taping up donations, that kind of thing. Around 2 AM, power flickers during a storm. When it comes back on, the living room TV — his TV, which hadn’t been plugged in — is on.

Loud static. Like old-school, earsplitting white noise. But the volume button doesn’t work. Neither does the remote. I go to unplug it, and the cord’s already out.

But it’s still on.

And in the corner of the screen, it says:

“CH 103”

My stomach actually dropped a little. Like I knew something was wrong immediately.

This TV is ancient — one of those old Sony CRTs that weighs like a small car. It doesn’t have digital anything. I’ve used it before and it never had more than maybe 60 or 70 working channels, tops. 103 isn’t real.

But there it was. Static, but weirdly patterned. Almost like shapes moving under the fuzz. I stared at it too long, I think. At one point, I swear I saw something move across the screen. Not on it — behind it. Like there was depth.

Then the static went quiet. Totally silent. And something started… whispering.

It didn’t sound like any language I know. Almost like it was being played backward. And it was low. Like someone whispering right next to your ear with a handful of gravel in their throat.

I was about to nope the hell out when the screen changed.

It went black. Just for a second.

Then it came back on, but instead of static, it was showing a video feed — of me.

Me on the couch. Staring at the screen.

And behind me, standing over the back of the couch, was something else.

Tall. Pale. Skin stretched like it barely fit. No eyes. Just a huge, open mouth like it was inhaling. Not screaming, just open. Way too wide.

I froze. Turned around — nothing was there.

Looked back at the TV — now it was closer to me. Still on-screen. Standing behind me in the feed. Same room. Same couch. Just… watching.

I grabbed the remote, hit every button. Nothing. I tried the power switch. Nope. I ripped the cord out of the wall again — still stayed on.

Then the screen flickered again, just once. Like a blink. And the whispering came back — but this time in English.

“Now we are watching you.”

I left. Straight-up ran out of the house, no bags, no shoes, just got in my car and drove.

Came back two days later with my cousin. Daylight, full sun. We go in — and the TV is gone. Not moved. Gone. Nothing else taken, nothing broken. Just an empty spot in the dust where it used to sit.

No one else had a key.

I don’t know what happened. I don’t even know if I want to know.

But if you ever find yourself flipping through channels in the middle of the night, and you see one labeled 103, don’t stop. Don’t even hesitate.

Just keep going.

Or turn it off and walk away — while you still can.
