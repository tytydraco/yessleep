My cats been going crazy around me for several days now and I’ve been seeing stuff about SkinWalkers on several of my social media platforms, so has my friend. We taunted my cat about being a SW and he yowled at us like we’d never heard before. 

There’s environmental factors that could explain his behavior. My building has been under demolition and reconstruction for months now and the stress did get to my cat for a few weeks, but he seemed to get used to it. It’s been getting cold outside for the past few months as well and I have not let him outside because there’s a foot of snow. However, neither of those factors are new but my cat’s behavior definitely is. 

My cat is normally around me and my friend, he stays here sometimes while I go to work. My cat is usually mellow with his fair bouts of zoomies he’s a 1 year old recently fixed cat, that’s natural it’s part of him. 


But Toes, my cat, has been looking at me so much more often with just a strange look. He’s been acting crazy, he has not acted like this since before I got him fixed, even though he’s been fixed for over a month now, and it had drastically improved his behavior. But lately he’s been jumping on top of the dresser in my room, thing is this space has always been empty and Toes had no interest in going up there. I have videos of him doing this recently and it’s strange. I even had a tassle hanging (admittedly too low) on the wall there and he’d never never jumped up there to play with it before. 

Until about a week ago, when I also started watching and warily talking about SW content on my phone, and reacting out loud. Now my cat acts crazy all the freaking time? I constantly think and hope he’s worn himself out but no he runs around so much then pants, and huffs/grunts much like a dog then rests for mere minutes before again channeling the damn Tasmanian Devil in my living room. He’s also begun jumping on top of me (he’s never done this before either) and attacking my hair and play biting me a lot harder and more frequently than he used to. He is not doing this to my friend, who is at the apartment just as often as I. My cat is just freaking odd around and towards me. 

Last night he was jumping up on the dresser and making a ton of noise in the room until 2:30am, I put him outside the room and closed the door, I have never done this before overnight. He pulled his dry food out and tore the bag open in the kitchen over night. Made a huge mess. He’s never done this before either. I am at a loss with this cat. 


My friend and I have been talking openly about the SW content we’ve been seeing on both our phones and expressing how terrifying it all is. 


Not saying my cat looks like what we’ve seen on our phones but it’s just creepy how he’s been acting out lately. My friend joked and said “hey let’s whistle at him” and I go “my cat?” And he said “no, the SW” and then my cat came into the room and made a real long weird gargled meow I’d never heard from him before, then proceeded to haul ass around my apartment. Me and my friend both got chills from this. I’m just off put I don’t know what to do.  

If absolutely nothing else I’d like advice to help me fix or work with/around my cats new behaviors. I love him deeply and want him to be happy and healthy so any help is appreciated. 

I’ll keep this updated.
