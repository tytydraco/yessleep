I sit amongst the passengers on a bus in hell. I look around, bunch’ of tough guy convicts, and then there's me, Guy - A very feminine looking man with a smooth face, short in height, and could legitimately pass as a woman. I look down at my black and white prison jumpsuit, and move my shaggy hair out of my eyes. 

I sit next to a window and lean against it, no thoughts in my head, I know why I'm on route to eternal damnation. One of the passengers eyes me, confused,” So what’s your story? Murder? Robbery? Jaywalking?”

“I did a bit of everything.” I answer, not looking at them, still leaning, waiting for the fire's of hell to scorch my body endlessly.

Hunored, the sinner laughs, “I see. Well, cheers then.”

The bus continues to drive, until suddenly it stops dead in its tracks. Which was odd, because outside of the window, it, even though it was hell, didn't appear to be the intended end. The passengers starts to murmur, wondering if this is where they’re meant to be dropped off. They are all nervous, as am I. But it doesn’t look anywhere important where we are. Just the middle of nowhere. Strange.

The bus driver speaks up over the radio, static-ie but could be heard clearly, “Someone’s in the way of the bus. Wait, they're approaching..” They pause, dumbfounded, “It’s… The Devil?”

The bus door opens, and a man enters - Who must be the Devil. The Devil towered over everyone, a large beast of a man, but on the contrary he looks like a normal young man at first glance, almost 20 or 24 in age but could be early 30's. He has a relatively narrow waist, a V-shaped torso, a wide chest and broad shoulders. His face has a sharp jawline and his chin is broad, his face is well-defined. His hair is curly and dyed red, his eyes are dark and sunken and ringed in black. He resembles a punk rocker and he wears a large red fur coat the length of a trenchcoat, a white shirt with an obscure band's logo, and leather combat boots. The Devil looks around the bus like a predator scanning for prey. Everyone is silent, stunned in fear, before his eyes land on me. His contorts into an awkward grin as he approaches me.

“There you are.” His voice was sharp to listen to, like a smoker who hasn't quit in 50 years. I was understandably confused, but before I could do anything, THE Devil was already where I was on the bus. They grabbed me easily, like I couldn't have made it easier for them if I tried, dragging me out of the bus. Am I going to die like 10 times harder now over and over again? Fuck…

But then, “I’ve been waiting ages for you, my dear.” Huh? Me?

“I’m so confused right now.” At this point, I just don't want to piss the guy off.

Out of the bus, he throws me over his shoulder, “I’ll explain later. But not here. Somewhere more appropriate.” And flies away using his wings. Please don’t molest me, please don't molest me. Scared, I close my eyes, and when we land, I'm in front of a large gothic mansion with hyper realistic blood spewing from the very tasteful fountains. I will admit, the blood fountains do add a nice contrast to the rest of the outside. Very nice, very nice.


The Devil sets me down and commands me to walk.The mansion's interior was comforting, but off-putting; fitting for the king of hell. The wallpaper was a deep crimson, accented by the gold fringe surrounding the windows and door frames, matching the gilt-framed mirrors. The furnishings were rich, heavy, and black. The carpets were also black; the rugs, blood red. Flickering candles were positioned on every table and surface. They burned their light unsteadily and with an angry sound. Their wax melted down over the hardwood floors, turning into a shiny red-gold layer, which would soon be replaced by more. 

Eventually, we reached a locked room to which The Devil opens the door. As we entered the study, displayed upon the wall like a sword being honored, was a rusted chainsaw. Clearly the saw part was never replaced, meaning it would take longer to cut something. Dear God, is he intending to use it on?


“What’s with the chainsaw?” I gulped.

The Devil laughs, “It’s why you aren’t burning for eternity right now.”


“W-What do you mean?”

The Devil places his hand on my shoulder, slouching a bit, “I’ve been having a burnout with my creativity lately.”

The Devil sighs as if he were reminding himself of the good ole’ days, “You know, I make movies and shows about all sorts of stuff: a sitcom about a family with a mysterious third parent that is a living doll that touches the kids, an interactive kids show about a man in a bear suit in a cellar, and cartoons about an apple teaching kids about various lessons.”

He brought me closer like a salesman trying to pitch to a dumb, stubborn man,”However, while I am successful, I have lost the spark that makes my content worth watching; I want to explore the rawest emotions with the biggest punches pulled.” He shakes me a little, “I want to show the gruesome nature of humanity on film to create the greatest profits.”

I avoided eye contact, his eyes were jarring, I hated them and I've only seen them for like 5 minutes, “Okay, but that still doesn’t answer my question.”

Bluntly, he says without hesitantation, “I’m making a snuff film.”

“Oh.”

“Yep.” His face was so neutral it just felt off.

“But why?” Seriously why?

He walked me over to the chainsaw, “It is the most evil type of film out there, so of course I would choose to make my own.”


Boasting proudly, he put his hand to his chest, “Only I, Lucifer Morningstar, am capable of producing the greatest, most ultimate murderin’ murder film in history, and by God will I do so.”

My face must've tipped him off that I wasn't following him, “I find filmmaking an art form to be,” he went on, “on a conceptual level, a perfect understanding of what art is and the various specific ways in which it is. And having "art" helps you be more creative, which is important.”

He let go of me, “I had the pleasure of working with a director who had great artistic ideas, knew how to compose the piece and did a very simple post-production, but they were incoherent and made no sense.” 

Almost dancing, he used his body to convey a scene of tragedy, “He worked with others who were great actors, but he had a hard time getting his vision and seeing right. Art is only one piece of the puzzle of knowledge and experience, and while you can explore and work with others to improve what you don't know, it's always very helpful to have a good understanding of as many areas as possible.” 

Stopping his eccentric rambling, he froze in place, stiff compared to before, “This is especially true when trying to understand the big picture and how it fits together.”

Repulsed, I chimed in, “But snuff movies are just gore involving real people. That’s a real person’s life being ended, not someone fictional. It’s disturbing, and I just don’t see the point of meaningless gore.”



Puffing his chest out, the Devil snarled, “Let me tell you something, okay?” Getting in my face he continued, “Gore, torture, the cruelty of man creates a profit. If there is violence, conflict or death, then it is top class shit. Nowhere is this more evident than in television news, where a gay man cannibalizes a fellow gay men and what do they do with his story? Do they scrap it into obscurity? No, he gets movies made about him, comics, shows. He’ll be featured as a costume in a halloween shop, he’ll be glorified for all of time.”

The Devil calmed down slightly, still evidently annoyed at my apparent stupidity, “Gore is profitable. And you know why it’s so profitable? People can appreciate the artistic side of gory events. They may see it as art or a form of self-expression. Some people may be interested in understanding the motivations for violence and its impact on individuals and society. Some people may have hobbies and can distinguish them from actual violence, while others may have unhealthy obsessions or hidden psychological issues. Some people like seeing blood because they have some sort of fetish for it or have fantasies about killing or eating people, perhaps cannibalism. Most people who love blood and lack empathy are usually either psychopathic idiots or sadistic mortals. Many people may find it confusing why some people are interested in graphic and violent content, but curiosity is a natural human trait and can lead some people to be interested in the darker aspects of life, including violence.” 

Like a teacher he explained, “They may want to understand the reality of violence or explore the limits of the human experience. Strong emotions and feelings related to blood can excite them. We can consume things we rarely see in real life in a controlled, safe environment where we can comfortably test the limits of our emotional responses. Both are deeply intertwined with the concept of evil, which again fascinates many of us, but we experience it minimally. This triggers the release of catecholamines, which can stimulate mental activity and self-reliance.”

He grabbed me again, I was frozen in fear, “Personally, I find gore funny, but probably not for the reasons you think. I love seeing how fragile the human body is and how easily it can break. I see blood every day, and it usually makes me feel more alive and aware. Gore is money. Gore is horror. Gore is God. Gore is me.”

I needed to change the subject fast, I could feel the tension rising between us,”I always thought of filmmaking as an unnatural process. It is always challenging when you create a reality within reality and are faced with unexpected situations. I think that’s why acting, but not directing is much better as a form of art.”

This seemed to have worked as the Devil calmed down, like a raging bull becoming a chill dog, “Maybe, but it’s usually worthwhile.”

Wanting more I said a simple, “Eh?” But I fumbled continuing this conversation in a nice direction, because the Devil was all like, “What do you mean, “eh.”?” Clearly he misunderstood me, so I backpedaled, trying to make up an argument, “Many movie studios suck at some problematic productions, but I can't find anyone who can say it's worth it, either in terms of artistic or commercial success, or in terms of positive experiences or professional success.”

As if he were dealing with a child, the Devil retorts, “But I still believe that there is always something to learn. Even if these are just warning signs to look out for when going to film. All films are art.”

“What about the obvious knock-offs?”

“Yes. Even if the motivation is not artistic, it is still art.”

“I think saying all movies are art is like saying that street smarts are as good as book smarts. It's a bit of a cop-out.” I don't actually believe that, but it's too late to back out now. What if the Devil thinks I'm a nerd?

“All films are works of art. Because not any rando with wealthy parents can go out and make movies. Even though the movie isn't very good, it's still worth watching. For me, it's about having the desire to experience emotions through visuals.”

Good, good, a way to save myself, “I guess you have a point, but going back to the chainsaw thing, I’m assuming you want to be your star? …Right?”

The Devil instantly reverts back to a salesman attitude, “Yes. You see, I designed this chainsaw for the sole reason to see life ending. This baby can cut through basically anything in existence, and damn if it wasn’t expensive to produce. If I were to have a demon use it, it would be disingenuous because demon’s are erratic and would not be able to portray the brutality like a human can.”

I gulped, “But why me specifically?”

“Because you are the perfect candidate for this. I needed someone who had a background in acting, but not successful enough to reach the heights, someone who would listen to my demands, and someone with an incredible amount of anger.”

If I had any drink before this, I probably would've pissed myself right now, “I see…”

The Devil reached his hand out to mine, wanting my hand to grip his in a binding of our fates, “So, will you accept taking the role of a-uh, well not a lifetime considering you are, you know, d-e-a-d.”

I felt uneasy about taking his hand in murder, “I don’t really know how I feel about this.

The Devil smirked, “You’d be a personal performer for God’s greatest creation. You’d be stupid to reject my offer.”

Hesitantly, I thought about my future with the Devil - Serving him and doing as he commanded. Was I ready for that sort of thing?

“Maybe.”

His face stretched, contorted beyond what I could comprehend, raw masculine rage, he clearly got what he got whenever without no or maybe being an option, “Maybe?” He let out a bellowing grunt.

“MAYBE? Okay, let me make it clear for you, cause clearly asking nicely didn’t work. YOU would go back to getting TORTURED for all of eternity. Those in hell suffer shame and disgrace, the sinners are salted with fire and they are burning forever, cut to pieces. There is no rest, no day or night, and there is no happiness. Hell is black like pitch, a place of weeping and moaning. There is no mercy there, no comfort, no salvation, no release. I am giving a personal get out of jail free card, do you understand me? You either become my actor, or I just kill you over, and over, and over again-Are you getting this yet, GUY?” 

Why? Why did I decide to piss off the Devil? Oh no, “I…: Pausing, staring at his face I mustered up the courage to speak, “Can we talk it over a drink?”

Reverting back to himself, albeit incredibly sassy, the Devil rolis his eyes, “Ugh, fine.”

And so we do. Sitting around his mansion's bar, the Devil and I share some drinks and discuss how our relationship is going to play out. I take a shot, “Okay, I'll do it.”

Taking a shot as well, the Devil slams the cup down, “Great.

“On one condition.” I had to get this to be in the contract.

“What could you POSSIBLY want? You dumb motherfucker.”

“You can't kill me.” There, there it is. The no-kill rule.

The Devil takes a shot again, “I can't guarantee that.”


“You’re the Devil, the most powerful being in Hell. Surely you can kill something else.”

The Devil stares into my eyes, “You’re gay.”

Offended I respond, “I am not gay. I’m quite straight.

The Devil pauses for a second, thinking, “You are gay.”

“You know, saying, "You're gay." Could also be interpreted as, ‘You’re gay! Hurray!’”

The Devil, buzzed, asks, “Do you have a history of mental illness in your family?”

“That shouldn’t matter right now in this discussion.”

The Devil drinks again, “You would have to have some sort of mental illness to willingly try to sleep with unwilling men. You were a prostitute, after all.”

I was about to defend my sexuality when, “Okay, look, I don’t want to argue. If that's your only requirement, then do we have a deal? Become my bitch.”

“Yes, we do.”

The Devil’s eyes light up. We shake hands and fire erupts from it. Suddey, a spiritual prison collar appears around my neck. The Devil plays with it drunkenly.

“It suits you.”

I look at his demonic yet human like hands around my neck, “You think so?”

The Devil takes his hands off my neck, the difference in when his hands are on my neck compared to when they aren't is major, “I do. There’s no turning back now.”

I look at him, grinning softly, the smell of liquor on his breath, “No turning back”

Leaning into the whisper, the Devil murmurs in my ear, “My punishments are gonna be so fucking awful for you. So fucking awful.”

I wince. His face still close to mine, “So, uh, where do I stay?”

Leaning away, the Devil points to himself, “Here with me. I can’t lose track of you, you’re too important to me.”

“Oh.”

“I’ll show you to your room now.”

In slightly altered perception, we both make our way out of the bar and into the hallway. Stopping at a door after only a few minutes of walking. The Devil is standing in front of a red door, dripping with blood. He turns to me.

“Ignore the blood coming from the door, it’s made from heathen wood. It just does that.”

I shrug, “I wasn’t going to say anything, but yeah, the blood door seems like something that would be disgusting.”

The Devil softly laughs, “Hell is weird like that.”

I laugh along too, “I can see that.”

“Well, enough talking, here’s where you’ll be staying.” The Devil opens the door.

The bedroom was disturbing. In the center of the room lay a large four-poster bed. The posts were made of iron, forged into the likenesses of demons' heads. Their faces were leering, open mouthed with large, black fangs dripping red saliva. The four-foot-tall statues of the demons were set apart by a red drapery hanging from the posts, separating the bed into two rooms. The drape was heavy and was made of an ungodly mixture of human hair and entrails. The sheets covering the bed were also stained with entrails and hair. But on the bed lay a dog.

The Devil, upon seeing the dog, goes from drunk macho man to a child, “Charlie, how’d you get in here? You silly dog.”

It is very clear this is a bedroom from hell. Contrasting the horrible scene, the Devil plays with his dog. “Who’s a good dog? You are, yes you are.”

I go about examining the room. “Is there a way I can exchange rooms?”

Saddened, the Devil stops momentarily playing with Charlie, “Aww, don’t like it?”

“Yes, clearly.”

The Devil pouts and mimes a man crying, “Well boo-hoo. Every bedroom is like this, except for mine.”

Without thinking I blurt out, “Can-”

The Devil stops me instantly, “No, you can’t sleep with me.”

“Fine. But I thought you said that the dead can’t rest, so why do I need a bedroom?”

The Devil rolls around in the bed with the dog, “Well sinners being tortured can’t rest because of the unending torture, but you’ve been spared, so you can rest.”

Remembering the no-kill rule established, I had to get clarity on one issue that was important, “So, like, I’m not going to be tortured ever, or…?”

Without missing a beat, “You’re still going to be tortured.”

“Shit.”

Like a lightbulb popped from his head, “Actually, you just reminded me of something.”

Confused, I asked, “I did?”

Gleaming, the Devil smiles, “Yep. I have something for you~!”

The Devil walks over to the bedroom closet, he opens it and pulls out a brown tan-ish suit with a white collared shirt and black tie. But that’s not what’s eye-catching - What’s eye-catching is the mask The Devil is holding: a mask of the character ‘Max Headroom’ with the rubber blond hair, white sunglasses with black tints, and a large toothy smile.

“So, what do you think?”

“That’s for me?”

The Devil proudly looks at the costume, “You betcha! I made it myself. Do you know how hard it is to sew a suit that won’t burn immediately in hell? Very difficult, but thanks to my awesome genius and my superiority with just about everything, I got it done.”

“I mean, it’s nice and all, but can I even wear it? I died in this, so aren’t I stuck in this, like, forever or something?” I ruffled my prison jumpsuit to emphasize my point.

The Devil calmly smiles, it's a gentle one, almost beautiful, “Nope. And even if that was the case, I would just make you wear this over your outfit anyways, because I put a lot of effort into this, okay? Do you even know how hard it is to find a decent sewing machine in hell? I had to go to the living world to get this thing, right? So I’m in this mom and pop shop, doing my thing, and I’m wearing my human disguise, which if you don’t know is just sunglasses, right, because if it works for Superman it’ll work for me, never been suspicious before.”

The Devil sets down the costume on a nearby stump table, looking back at me he goes on, “So, I’m in this store, right, I’m in there and I’m browsing and I find this sewing machine, the same one I used to make this outfit, so I grab the box and bring it to the counter, okay so I’m blending in pretty good, and when I go to pay the lady, and this lady is like a solid 10 out of 10 super model with enormous breasts, like these titties were water balloons, and she was so sexy, well she, who happens to run the store says, “What’s your name, handsome? You are so sexy and cool, I want-no need to have your babies.””

The Devil mimes this all out, “And this pretty common, because I’m the Devil, and like the sexiest person ever, women are constantly battling for my seed, anyway, I say, “Jeffrey Conner Tyler Kurtis” Which is one of my many, great super awesome alter egos, and it’s ingenious because it’s 4 first names, if you didn’t know, and she said to me, she said to me, “You can have it for free if you have sex with me right now in the middle of this store,” and you know what? I hit that. And that pussy was, muwah, chef’s kiss.” The Devil blows a kiss at me.


“So anyways, I got sidetracked, look, I worked really hard making this for you. Okay? Like really hard.”

“I don’t believe half of what you said, but okay.”

Boasting, the Devil sits back on the bed, “Just know that I fuck, like, all the time. I’m tapping demon ass, slutty demon ass, human ass, basically any booty that lets me. Except for men, I don’t do men. With men, I feel it’s the same as bestiality. Just feels wrong, I don’t get how the gays do it. A guy sticking his dick into a guy's butt is gross; that’s where his shit comes from. It’d feel the same as fucking a pile of dog crap. It’s unnatural.”

Joking, I say, “Man, you suck.”

The Devil roars, almost like he's trying to assert dominantly that only he can harm me, “What are you going to do to me? Hmm?”

I felt in the moment strong, he was drunk, he had the dog in the room so he wouldn't chase me around, I had to show I could stand up for myself, “I’m gonna kill you.”

“Mmhmm.”

The Devil grabbed me without much effort, his hands picking me up, showing his immense strength - to him, I was the weight of a feather, so he had to be gentle with me so I wouldn't break. Wrapped around and under my arm pits, the only thing I could see was his face - his face grinned, his eyes looking at me with delight. He was going to enjoy whatever he was about to do to me. His fingers clasped, digging into me, and like magic, I felt safe in his hands- Scared, pinssafe. Pinning me against the wall of the room, he holds in place with his body, the combined heat between both of us was enough to be considered a sauna. I was sweating, he on the other hand, was fine. My only exit was him, I was locked in place, whatever he wanted he was going to get.

He brought his face closer to mine, his chest on me, his legs squashing kine, but his face he brought closer, “If I put even a nanogram amount of force behind my hands, pushing my body against yours, you know what would happen to you? Splatt. Gone. Red paste against the wall.” Grabbing both of my arms and holding them tightly he says, “I hold the ultimate power over you, so humor me. Go on and tell me how you would go about that.”

I scoff, humor him even, “You’re a creative man, you would hate it if you died a boring death, right?”

That got him going, he took one of my hands and held it to his face, using me as his puppet. To him, I was nothing more than a play thing; he knew he could have me whenever, “Oooh, I would hate it~”

He pressed his body harder against me, he was bigger in every way, “I would sneak up behind you.” The heat between us was almost too much, my sweat drenching his clothes.

The Devil ignored that, still acting as the alpha, “Oh yeah?” I could hear his heart beat, it was normal. He wasn't scared or nervous, he was in charge and he knew I couldn't do anything, so he would touch and tease me all he liked, so long as I gave in and presented him with what he wanted. 

“And I would slit your throat when you weren’t expecting it.” Thinking of all these ways to hurt and penetrate the Devil was getting harder, but he wouldn't let me go. I wanted freedom, but it was only allowed through him. He tussled my hair mockingly like a bully, and in a jest, he presented what it would be like if I did penetrate his throat.

“Oh my goodness, imagine the blood splatter. So much of my blood would be painted on the floor, imagine that. You got any more ideas?”

“I would tie you to a chair.”

He laughed, “Great start so far.”

“And I would begin by removing your fingernails.”

He found humor in that, “You’re such a sadist, go on.” He demanded.

“Then as you were writhing in pain, I put rubbing alcohol all over your legs and thighs.”

“Heh, what for?” He asked.

“To light your legs on fire, and you know what I would do next?”

“Do tell me.” He was so close to my face, I almost couldn't bring myself to continue.

“I would wait about 2 minutes, and then I would put out the fire.”

“And after that? What are you going to do to me? I want you to be as descriptive as possible, you got it?” He enjoyed this banter thoroughly.

“Gladly. I would take a butcher’s knife.”

“Oh no, not a knife~”

“And I would cut off pieces of your burnt flesh and force feed them to you.”

“I wonder how I would taste. Do show me.” He wanted more from me, but could I deliver?

“After that,” I paused.

“After that?”

“I would grab a box of 9 inch nails and hammer them into your hands and arms, like a pin cushion.”

“You’re being so creative with this.”

“And for the finale, I would take the knife and-:

“And what?” The Devil was waiting for the edge of the climax.

“I would gut you, but to add salt on the wound, I would let in feral pigs and let them clean up the evidence that you were there.”

The Devil chuckles a bit, clearly impressed. He dropped me, unpinning me from the nightmare I just experienced. He backs up, thank God, “I think you’re the perfect candidate for my film.”

“Thanks.” I'm happy I satisfied him like I did, “What would happen if I did actually try to kill you?” I jested. 

In a good mood, the Devil answers, “You wouldn't be the first. Many have tried, but I’m still here, no?”

“I will.” I shot him a look that meant I have meant it.

“You won’t. And if you can’t handle that fact, then I don’t think this is going to work out. And that is the case, I’ll just have to kill you. Actually, how about I rape you? And if you try to resist me, If you even think of screaming, I'll slit your throat right here in this room, and watch you bleed out.”

“I’ll take my chances.”

“You’re a righteous one, I like that. I’ll break down that soon enough, trust me.” He pet the dog again.

“I’ve already been through hell, fuck, my entire life has been hell, I legitimately don’t care what happens to me anymore.”

Looking up, he says, “You’re slowly becoming one of my favorites, you know that?”

“I could care less what you think of me.” That was true, I really could care less.

“You should. Who do you think holds the power here?”

“Who?” I mocked him.

“Me.”

:Wow, that was so not obvious, wow.” I did some jazz hands too.

“You didn’t have to be a dick about it, jackass.”

“You know what? I’m leaving.” I tried to leave the room, but the Devil blocked my way. You poece of shit.

“Who do you think will accept you? Who do you think will let you be a part of their life? He'll isn't kind to sinners, especially your type.” He poked my chest.

Thinking quickly, I answered, “I don’t know, your dog, maybe?”

“My dog? Okay.”

Walking over to where the dog is, the Devil stomps the dog to death. Oh my God, oh shit. I-I-I… He killed his own dog. I think I'm going to be sick. The Devil looked back at me with hate in his eyes, “The only person in your life is me. You got that?”

“H-How could you do this? To your own dog?”

“I’m the Devil, bitch! Motherfucking Lucifer Morningstar is the name.”

I can't believe this, “I-I-I hate you.”

“Good. Now, it’s been a long day, get some sleep, we’ve got work to do tomorrow.”

The Devil left the room. How, why, what the fuck? I don’t know why, but I tried to comfort the dead dog. It didn’t deserve this. In a better life, it would have a loving family, but sadly, it had Lucifer. Fuck Lucifer.
