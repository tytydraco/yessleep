Before the incident, my family and I were living happily in a lovely home. My daughter safe and sound in the crib, looking as adorable as she is. Her name is Bonnie, my little baby girl. She was born 5 months ago on April 6th 1972. When I first saw her, I couldn't explain how happy I was. My wife carried her in her arms in the bed and me sitting by her side, it was the most amazing moment for the both of us. She was a gift to the family.

My lovely wife, Adeline cooper, is one of the most amazing person I've ever met. We've met each other when we were working on a project at high school. We didn't know each other at first but while we were doing the project I got to know a lot about her. A brilliant artist such as herself would draw really beautiful paintings I've never seen before. I remember the first painting of a world full of light and life. It was amazing that I got inspired to keep drawing more often with her. The more we learn about each other, the more we fell in love. We even went to the same college for arts. Then we got married and have our little baby Bonnie.

My name is Duncan Donovan, I'm not really a brave man nor a fighter. I do art but differently than my wife's. I draw traditionally with a pencil for sketching, shadows, and lighting. It really amazes me to draw something from perspective, and what motivates me to do that is to make pictures to remember the moments I've had in our life. I remembered that I kept a drawing of me hiding in the trees as a kid. It's to remember how much of a coward I am. I don't know why I still kept that drawing. I should've dumped it but part of me wanted to keep that.

I used to live with both my parents until they got divorced that I lived with my dad instead of mom. I asked him why and he told me that her influence will trouble my life because she's mad crazy. My mother once told me to be a part of the cult, Cult of the Archon. My dad saw this as a blade that'll cut my own path to goodness. When I asked dad what's the Cult of the Archon, he said it's just some hippie community. He doesn't like hippies because of their beliefs for peace in their own way.

At the time of my wedding, the most amazing part of our life, my dad is the only parent who's there for me. I thought mom would come over to the wedding to see me again but she didn't. I didn't know a lot about mom, even when I asked my dad about her he would just dismiss her. I know a part of him loved her but I still don't get why he doesn't want to talk about mom. But at least I'm happy to see dad is there for me.

For years, I've been a coward. Not a brave man at all. Yet I had that instinct to protect my daughter and Adeline. The thought of seeing them getting hurt gave me chills in my body. But even with that protective instinct, I'm still afraid to fight because I had no idea what to do and the pain I have to pay to protect them. I don't want to be a coward anymore. I want to be strong to protect them. But I wasn't strong at all. Not enough.

It was afternoon that day. I was just sketching in the living room with my wife and baby Bonnie in her arms. Sketching the day our baby was born. The sunlight got dim, so the lights in the ceiling were on for me to see clearly of my sketch. Bonnie, carried in my wife's arms, was looking at my art skill. I showed her the picture I was sketching and said. "Look Bonnie, it's you with mommy and daddy."

She made an exciting noise like what a baby would sound like when they're happy. The sound she makes is so adorable that my heart felt sweet like an apple. My wife smiled warmly as she looked upon the sketch. "You're going to put that in her room?"

"I'm still thinking about that. Don't know where I should be putting it at, so that we can both see it anytime freely." I gave her a warm smile and a gesture by moving my pencil around in the air like a wizard doing magic.

I went back to sketching as the sun goes down. The curtains at the window glow dimly orange. The light above still bright and warm. Bonnie's small cute hand grabbed my sleeve and tugged. A tickling sensation caught my chest that I chuckled. I dropped my pencil and gently touched her small hand. "Looks like it's daddy's turn to hold her." Adeline's voice expressed a lovely tone.

"Ok then." I can feel the smile on my face as I pass over the sketch to Adeline and her passing me Bonnie. With Bonnie in my arms, I cradle gently as she smiles so adorably. I watched Adeline sketch the part I hadn't finished. She's got a really good perspective to what I want to draw there.

Everything was going well and calm until suddenly when the night came, Bonnie started to cry. It wasn't a normal cry like babies usually cry. It was something different and I grew worried. I thought she was just hungry but something doesn't feel right.

"Hey, what's wrong baby Bonnie?" I looked to Adeline to meet her eyes. I can see fear in her eyes and her mouth slightly open as if speechless. I've never seen her being so afraid before and that made me even more nervous. "They're here."

"What?" My heart sank and my mind confused. I just sat on the couch confused with baby Bonnie crying in my arms. She dropped the sketch and pencil, got up and whipped her head around franticly. "Adeline, what's wrong? What do you mean they're here?"

"They're coming for our daughter. We have to hide now!" Adeline isn't a prankster at all. I've never seen her do anything like pie jokes or make traps. At this moment, I can feel the fear in her soul. This is not a prank. I believed her and that's what makes me feel something is off.

I immediately got up and passed Adeline, our baby Bonnie, before taking the cellphone. I then closed the curtains and peaked through the window to see who she was talking about.

What I saw caught me in disbelief and utter terror. It was the cult, the damn Cult of the Archon. I can recognize them because they always wear this milky white robes with a red cross at the front. Their heads hidden away by the cone like hood. Why are they here? What do they want from our baby?

Chills slither in my body, freezing me in place to watch them walking towards our house like a tiger ready to pounce on their prey. "Go! Hide!" I immediately went to the bedroom to get my gun from the shelves. My wife and child are hiding inside of the closet as she tries to quiet down baby Bonnie. "Shh. It's ok. Mommy's here. Mommy's here."

As I slowly walked to the living room, there were loud aggressive banging on the door. I can hear one of them yelling menacingly. More banging came from around the house, then to windows. I thought that they were just hippies but this is shockingly terrifying. Is there something about them I didn't know? And how did they find us? Why now? I dialed 911 and to my relief, he responded.

*Hello, this is the police department, how may I help you?*

"Yeah, there are a bunch of people trying to get in and threaten my family!"

*Alright, where are you?*

"I'm at Springdale, Nether street, 3421!" Suddenly, the windows broke by rocks. Doors broken down. And I can hear the other door at the backyard broke down. We're completely surrounded. I ran to the bedroom and franticly raised my gun at cultists, who are now in the bedroom. "Back off or I'll shoot!" I wanted to shoot but I've never used a gun in my life. The only reason why I bought it was to scare intruders off. I don't want to kill them or anything else to happen. I was just so afraid.

One of the cultist swung a bat at my hand that I dropped the gun. I screamed in pain but also with the guilt that I can't do anything to stop them as they walk into the bedroom to search. I tried to get up but one of the cultist dragged me away into the living room. "Get away from them!"

To my horror, I can hear my wife and child screaming from the bedroom. The cultist threw me to the ground and forced me to kneel by kicking me in the stomach so hard that I couldn't move. My stomach was about to puke but there is nothing for me to vomit out. They drag my hair, forcing me to watch my wife and child being forcibly dragged away. My baby Bonnie, now in the arms of the cultist, was crying loudly that my heart is stricken of terror and my soul fell down in fear and guilt. My wife being dragged by the hair, struggling to escape from the cultist's grasp. I began crying out to her. "Adeline! Bonnie!!"

"Duncan! Bonnie!!" Her screams, Bonnie's cries, my yells, all mixed in the most gruesome moment in our life. Why is this happening to us? What do they want? What is it with these bastards!

Then, right in front of my eyes, a cultist with a knife in hand, slit Adeline's neck like a sacrificial lamb. My heart shattered into bits. My wife, my beloved wife, is killed right in front of me. "ADELINE!!" I watch her took her last breath as blood comes out of her neck. The baby crying, my cries and screams, we were going to die here by those fucking hippies!

They were cheering and laughing in celebration as me and my baby cried in hopelessness. They were drinking my wife's blood. Before, I didn't want to kill, but now I had that urge just to kill every single one of them. I tried to get up and move but they kicked me again in the stomach. My face hit the ground and my tears fell. "ADELINE!!" My voice broke, trying to scream out.

I want to break free, to save my daughter. But I was too weak! I watch them take away my baby Bonnie. Out into the dark night. They dragged my wife's body away too. I couldn't help but to scream and cry.

One of the cultist kneeled down at me, looking at me with its shadowed face. But I can see the grin on its face. I tried to look away but the cultist in front of me forced me by gripping my hair. "Dear Duncan Donovan. You will witness the great god's return in the flesh. For your daughter will be the body of our god. The god who ruled mars. We will meet again." Her voice feminine, nearly as similar as my wife's.

I yelled at her, screamed at her at the top of my lungs. But my voice broke trying. "I'll... kill you!"

She giggled, mocking me, which makes me even more pissed off. "No. But you will grow to our demands." Then suddenly, I was blacked out.

I'm not sure how long I was out. I was in the hospital bed with bandages wrapped around my head. I tried to get up but when I did, a surge of pain courses in my body like a snake's venom. I groaned as I lay my head on the bed. My beloved wife killed by these hippie bastards, and my baby Bonnie was kidnapped. And me being in the hospital. I want to curse at god for sparing me instead of my wife and child.

Then, I caught eye on a man sitting by my side on the chair. He isn't wearing a cops uniform nor anything ordinary. He had a well shaved bear that looked like he had shaved a month ago or 2, messy brown hair as if he hadn't gotten a hair cut, brown tattered coat that looked like it would be worn in the war, and boots that I didn't know it exists. "Ah, you're awake now."

I didn't reply. Instead, I just breathed in and out. Waiting impatiently for me to just get out of here. He sighed sadly before he spilled out the words. "I'm sorry for your wife's loss and the kidnapping of your child. I would've killed those sons of bitches if I was there."

"Who are you and why are you here?" I asked impatiently. I don't care about what he said about me nor my family. I just wanted to be left alone to myself and get the hell out of here. But I had to know who is he and why he's here.

He didn't react, instead he just nodded. "My name is Darwin Michigan. I'm here to tell you that we have tracks to where the suspects have gone to. They're located at an abandoned mansion at Archon Arena."

"Why are you telling me this?" Either he understood I wanted revenge for my family and rescue my daughter or just info dump on me. At least, I'm grateful he had told me this. Because I'm going to kill those fuckers myself. I don't care if the police arrests me or execute me. I will rescue my baby daughter.

"Because I know you want to rescue your daughter. And when you're better, call me and I'll be there when you're ready." He picked out a card out of his front pocket and placed it lightly on the table next to my bed. I found a new motivation. To kill the cultist and rescue my baby Bonnie. I can't explain how much I hated the cultist for what they've done. I'll never be a coward ever again.

After I got better from my injuries, I went back home to find a yellow tape surrounding it. The police is holding my home for investigations. The detectives asked me some questions and when I answered them they didn't believe me at all. "The Cult of the archon? Mr. Donovan, don't lie to us. The cult has nothing to do with this. Plus, there is no evidence that can define them as killers." I can't stand his voice. So I just left them.

My dad welcomed me to live in his household. I stayed there for about 3 days, packing equipment that I'm going to bring. Dad even helped me out, giving me guns and a knife to bring. He knew I was going out to save Bonnie. But the guns and a knife, that's what I felt so strange about him. I thought we had different beliefs about them but here and now, I wasn't so sure if that's true. He told me to keep myself away from those who have crosses on their bodies. I asked why my dad is helping me. What he told me made me panic in terror.

"Your mother didn't tell you everything about them. The real reason I didn't like them is not because they're hippies, but because they're murderous freaks, but more than that. I don't know how to explain this clearly. I know she's a part of this. She confessed to me about that after you turn 7. She wanted to marry me and have a child of her own to populate the cult. The cult is so fucking disgusting.

"When she tries to make you join the cult, I knew I had to get you out of there. But I had to do it smoothly. I lied about the divorce. We never got divorced. I drove us away from her at night because if we did it in the morning, she'll come and find us. I loved her but she's going to turn you into them.

"The cult, when I came to see what's going on, I've witnessed the most horrible things in my life. The walls are filled of carvings of stars, crosses, and a dragon with the head of a lion, body of a snake, and wings like a bat. Can't believe I remember what it looked like. And those cultists were having an orgy at first, then they went to cannibalism. They kept eating each other like animals, and the women, I didn't know it was possible, they were giving birth so fast in just a minute after their orgy. Then they started eating the babies and cheered. I was walking into something evil. I wanted to just call the police but I don't know if I could. Knowing they might come after me and you.

"Then I saw someone, who's wearing a white robe, carrying a baby. She was chanting in words I don't understand, it's like ancient in some way. She was walking towards a dark pit and then, she did something I can never forget nor get out of my head. She threw the baby into the pit. And when I heard the crunching sound of bones and flesh, something came from the sky, no, from space. It looked both alien and angelic. There was a bright shining light above the sky, just like heaven. It got into the pit and it roared like some sort of devil from hell. Then everyone was screaming or crying as if it didn't go to plan. Their god's plan. So I got out of there and never came back again.

" Everybody in this world believed they were just hippies, but we both knew that's not true. This is why I didn't tell you about this. I thought if you just thought of them as hippies, they won't come after you. But I was wrong."

His eyes are full of terror. I did once saw him looked scared when we left mom. But now, he's much more frightened than I have ever seen. What really caught my attention was the part where someone throws a baby into the pit. The thought of my baby Bonnie being thrown into that pit made me pack up everything I need and run to my car. I can hear my dad yelling at me to wait. But I can't wait. No. I don't want to be too late to rescue her.

I got in my car and pressed my key into the ignition. Then, just as I hit the brake, my dad knocked on the window. I immediately stopped and and lowered the window. "Son! You can't go there alone! It's too dangerous! They'll do terrible things to you!"

I don't want to bring him along with me. I don't want my dad to suffer and die to those bastards. I don't want to do this alone but I can't let anyone die to them. Not my dad. "I have to! I don't want you to die! I'm going there alone and save my daughter without anyone getting killed!" Then I drove off to Archon Valley.

*I love you dad. And I'm not going to let you die there. And don't worry, my beloved Adeline, I'm going to rescue our baby Bonnie.*
