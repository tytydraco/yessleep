2 days ago I noticed a man standing outside my apartment window. The first time I saw him, it was just a quick glance as I opened the curtains for my cat; she liked to sit on the window sill and watch the birds in the trees and the people down below.

The man stood across the courtyard with his back to me. I thought it was odd that he was just standing there facing the brick wall, but I just shrugged it off and went on with my day.

Later that night, my cat was still sitting at the window. She’d often spend hours there and would only leave to eat and use the litter box. I went over to pet her and noticed the man again. He was standing in the same exact spot, still staring at the wall. I tilted my head and wondered to myself if he had been standing there this whole time.

I watched him for several minutes, absentmindedly petting my cat; he didn’t move at all. An idea came to me and I felt like an idiot; *what if I’d just wasted my time staring at a mannequin.* I laughed and shook my head, feeling foolish.

Suddenly, my cat’s hair stiffened and she stood up, hissing. I glanced down, but by the time I did she’d already leapt off the window sill and ran into the bathroom.

“What’s gotten into you?” I asked.

I scowled at her before looking back outside. The man whom I’d thought was a mannequin was no longer staring at the wall. He had turned in the direction of my building and stood there, just as still as he had before. I couldn’t tell what he was looking at from this distance but he gave me the creeps. I quickly closed the curtains and went to bed.

By the morning my cat had left the bathroom and relentlessly purred against my face. I glanced down at my phone and saw the time.

“Shit,” I muttered. I’d accidentally slept in—and she was obviously hungry.

I quickly filled her bowl and changed into my work clothes before rushing out the door. I headed down the stairs toward the back entrance and was halfway across the courtyard when I remembered the strange man. I looked over and, to my relief, he was no longer standing there. The way he stood so eerily-still seemed so strange and inhuman to me, but I was just glad that he had moved along.

I made it to work on time but my manager asked me to stay late anyway. One of my coworkers called off and he wanted me to cover his shift. I didn’t want to but I begrudgingly agreed.

The work day was long and mentally draining. It was dark by the time I got back to the apartment. I crossed the empty courtyard and was reaching for the door handle when the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. A chill ran up my back and I had the weird feeling I was being watched. I glanced around and then instinctively looked to the spot where the man had stood—he wasn’t there.

I shrugged off the feeling and briskly made my way up the back stairs and into my apartment. The sound of both locks clicking into place put me more at ease but I still grabbed my old baseball bat from the closet and set it next to the couch—just in case.

I changed out of my work clothes and grabbed a six pack from the fridge, finally sitting down in front of the television. Beer and binging YouTube videos sounded like a good time after such a long day. I cracked open the first can and took several big swigs before my body finally started to relax. I pressed the power button on the remote and leaned back into the cushions, inevitably vegging out.

10 minutes passed before I noticed my cat sitting in the bathroom doorway. She stared out, focused on the closed curtains across the room.

“You wanna people watch?” I asked her.

I got up and pulled the curtains aside. She didn’t move—just continued to stare. I shrugged and sat back down, leaving the curtain open so she could jump up if she wanted to. I downed the rest of my first beer and grabbed a second.

By the time I’d finished the last beer in the pack, only an hour and half had passed. I was feeling pretty good by this point, but also pretty exhausted.

I walked into the bathroom and shooed the cat out, closing the door behind me. I positioned myself in front of the toilet and pulled down the front of my pants, letting loose into the bowl.

Outside the bathroom I could hear my cat hissing and meowing aggressively. I sighed and tried to hurry nature along.

“What’s the matter, Zoey?” I asked, quickly pulling up my pants and opening the bathroom door. My cat was underneath the coffee table staring at the window, hissing.

“What? You don’t like the window now?” I asked, walking over to it.

I reached for the curtain to close it but stopped dead in my tracks. Halfway across the courtyard was the man. He stood there perfectly still, but this time there was no mistaking it, he was staring directly at my window. My heart skipped a beat, and I waited, but he didn’t move, he just continued looking. Leering. There was something about his gaze that was deeply unsettling.

My heart was beating fast but the alcohol coursing through my veins turned some of the fear into anger. I reached for the frame and pulled up, opening the window, immediately leaning out to yell at him.

“Hey, fuckhead! What the hell is your—“ I stopped. The man was gone. I looked around all over but I couldn’t see him anywhere. The evening air blew across my face and I reached up and rubbed my forehead. A cold sweat coated my fingers and I shivered.

I pulled myself inside and stood up, confused. I was about to close the window, when I noticed the man standing out in the courtyard again. My heart sank and I slowly bent down.

Through the glass, the man was there, but once my eyes jumped over the window’s frame, the man disappeared. I moved my head up and down a few times, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. On the last movement, when I looked through the glass again, the man had jumped 10 feet closer to my apartment.

I stumbled back and fell on my ass; Zoey hissed again behind me. I scrambled to my feet and ran back to the window, the man was even closer now. He stood directly below, staring up at me. His eyes were wide open; he never blinked.

Not letting him out of my sight, I asked through the glass, “What the fuck do you want??”

The man didn’t move a muscle, but somehow, a smile slowly crept across his face—so slowly that I couldn’t be sure if he’d just been smiling the whole time.

I blinked, and the man was gone. I frantically craned my neck trying to see where he had disappeared to. A scary thought occurred to me and I quickly grabbed the baseball bat from the living room and unlocked my apartment door. I ran toward the back staircase of the building and when I turned the corner, my legs almost gave out.

The door at the top of the back staircase was open and thudding against something I couldn’t see. Gravity tried to pull it closed and it would stop and jerk open again.

I was terrified but the bat and beer combination gave me the courage to push forward.

“Ha ha, got me good. You can come out now,” I said, the fear clear in my voice. I held the bat tighter and inched closer.

I didn’t realize it right away but the hallway was uncharacteristically void of sound; no voices from the other tenants, no televisions, no nothing. The only sound I could hear was the door banging back and forth, and even that sounded dulled in the hallway.

 I stepped cautiously forward until I reached the doorway, but didn’t cross the threshold. My eyes scanned up and down the door and it’s hinges trying to figure out what it was caught on, but I found nothing. I extended the bat forward and pressed it against the door trying to stop it from banging.

The bat was violently ripped from my hand and went flying into the stairwell. I think I was in shock, as I stood there for several seconds, completely unable to move. The same thoughts repeated over and over in my head. *There’s nothing there… There’s nobody…*

I sprinted back to my apartment and pulled at the bottom window section, yanking it out and splintering the old wooden frame in the process. As I ran out through my apartment door holding the pane in front of me, I glimpsed a torso through the glass. I tripped and slammed into the opposite wall of the hallway; the old glass panel in my hands shattered all around me as I fell.

Glass shards littered the floor and my cat freaked out and ran down toward the front of the building.

I sat there on my ass terrified, surrounded by broken glass. A few feet away, I heard a crunch and the shards started to move. I was up and gone before I could even think.

I ran down the hall after my cat, picking her up along the way; I’d never run so fast in my entire life. Zoey whined in my arms as I circled around the outside of the building to get to my car in the back parking lot.

My tires peeled as I got out of there. Zoey sat on my passenger side floor, meowing fearfully. I didn’t stop driving until I’d reached my parent’s house a half hour away.

My mom and dad shared a worried look on their faces when they opened their door. I stood there, barefoot, with several cuts on my arms and feet. I had left my phone behind in the apartment so I wasn’t able to warn them I was coming.

I tried my best to explain without sounding absolutely insane. I told them that someone at the apartment was stalking me and I didn’t know who it was or what they wanted—that part was true. I recounted how I’d fled without closing my door and only managed to take Zoey with me. It helped sell the reality of the threat when I’d started to shake and stutter as I was retelling the story. I explained away the cuts by saying the window had popped out of it’s frame and I tripped over it as I ran. I had to lie to them. I couldn’t tell them what I really saw, because I didn’t know what I really saw—and they wouldn’t believe me anyway. I finished by telling my dad that I never wanted to go back to that place again. He saw the fear in my eyes and accepted my decision without much grief.

The following morning, I emailed the guy that rented me the apartment; he was pretty pissed about the broken window and me trying to end my lease early. My dad said he’d smooth things over with him while he was there packing up my stuff. I tried to talk him into hiring someone instead of going himself but he wouldn’t listen.

I’m currently sitting here in my parent’s living room; I’ve barely slept at all. I’m using my mom’s phone to text my dad every 10 minutes to check if he’s okay. My mom keeps trying to pull me away from the windows to get some sleep but I’m terrified that the man will follow my dad home.

I’ll never forget how he looked at me. I never want to see those eyes again.
