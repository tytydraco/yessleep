I'm a huge fan of rock music, especially from the 90s. The grunge movement was probably one of the greatest things to ever happen. I often go to thrift shops and bookstores to get good deals on vinyls and CDs and stuff. It's really fun to go out looking for rare finds from bands you love. Like, last week, I got a copy of Rubberneck for pretty cheap. But I'm getting off track, y'all read the title, so you're expecting me to actually talk about the album. 

I went to Goodwill yesterday and looked around where you can typically find movies and vinyl records and the like. After looking through all the clutter (AKA things I had no interest in) I found something that looked really cool but...looking back on it now, I'm both wishing I'd never bought it and extremely happy that I did. It was an album by a band I'd never heard of before. The Screeching Demons. The album was called Culture Shock, and it looked 90s as fuck. The album cover showed 3 people standing in an alley. I recognized this alley since I drive past it from work, so I assumed it was some local band or something. Needless to say, I just found a grunge album for a good price and I was sure as hell gonna buy it to see what was on it. 

When I got home, I popped it into the record player and listened to it. I'm just gonna say it was one of the BEST local albums I'd ever heard. I'd say it's almost up there with the big 4 of grunge. It's a damn shame this album was unknown. While I listened to it, I read the back cover to see the tracklist and the band members' names. 10 songs, which I have since digitized for the purpose of archival and will now list here.

* Nowhere
* Burn
* Cyanide
* They Can't Find Me Here
* Who Am I?
* Fucking Up
* The Biggest Loser
* Masonry
* Canadian Bacon
* We Don't Know How To End An Album So Fuck Off

As for the members? Derek O'Callahan on vocals and guitar, Megan Parker on bass, and Sal Connelly on drums. Of course, people I doubted anyone had ever heard of. And there was a producer credit, as well, one Layne Cobain. This made me roll my eyes, since it was clearly a fake name, taking Kurt Cobain's first name and Layne Staley's last name and mushing them together. But it did interest me a lot, so I looked up the band. And what did I find? Nothing. Only a few forum posts after several attempts and making it more specific. I read through them, nothing really special. Just people asking "Hey, have you heard about this album?" which most people answered with no. I clicked off quickly as the album was ending, since the tenth song was ending at that point. About a minute, I went to turn it off before I heard something from the record player. Beeps. It sounded like morse code or something, so out of curiosity, I used some audio translator on the web to get it to work. The result was...reversed text. Great. So what did I do next? Reverse the text, of course! And...what it said shocked me.

"richard romero is a monster he has us trapped here please help us"

I had...no idea who this guy was. Was he the person behind Layne Cobain? I decided to dig further. No other results aside from some actor and a bunch of other guys. After a while, my efforts led me to a post about a crime forum from a few years back from a user named Gravelle1989...and that was how I learned the horrible truth.

The reason nobody knew about The Screeching Demons and hadn't found more of their music was that all the members were murdered before they could hit it big. Derek died from cyanide poisoning and his body was found in a field in the middle of nowhere. Megan was killed after she was stabbed in the head with a bricklaying trowel, which was left in there. No fingerprints were found. The only thing that was found of Sal was strips of skin covered with ashes. Their deaths were tied to the names of the songs on their album. This person said in the post that it was Layne (AKA Richard Romero) who did this. So I decided to do the best thing I could...I posted the story to another crime forum.

Later that night, I got a dm from a user named BuddyBuddy203. This was the message he sent me.

"Check Gravelle1989's post history. You have 5 minutes to prepare. I am on my way."

I did what the message said out of curiosity and I realized something.

*Gravelle1989 was an active user until the post about The Screeching Demons.*

I began panicking. This guy who I assumed was Robert Romero was coming to my house. I...probably should've called the cops or something, but out of panic, I hid in the closet. A few minutes later, I heard him. He broke in. It sounded like he broke the window and opened it from inside. I didn't know what to do so I took a few deep breaths, tried regaining my composure, and called 911. I told them that a serial killer was in my house. They told me to hang on.

I don't know how long I was in that closet. It could have been minutes, it could've been hours. It certainly felt like hours. But eventually, the cops knocked on the closet door. Told me it was safe to come out now. I was safe. Later on, I heard that Romero was in prison from that same crime forum. Honestly…I’m glad I managed to do something.

This post isn’t just me telling you my story. It’s me telling you the story of Derek O’Callahan, Megan Parker, and Sal Connelly. The three victims whose lives didn’t deserve to end so soon. The three people who started a band, found someone to produce it with them, and ended up getting much more than they bargained for.

As for how I am right now? I’m doing alright. Still thrifting, still record hunting, but there is still one thought that lingers…What if Romero escapes from prison? Will he come after me? I know I’ll likely never have a solid answer to that question, but I still stay up at night and keep my doors locked, just in case he ever escapes.
