The lessons started that night.

Miriam taught me grounding techniques—ways to anchor my consciousness to my body, to my humanity, to my sense of self. She taught me to visualize my mind as a house with rooms, and to keep the entities I encountered in specific rooms, contained, separate from my core self.

"When you let Yth'naal in," she said, "you let it into every room. It touched everything. That's why you feel different. That's why your eyes look different. It left traces of itself in places it shouldn't have been."

She taught me to clean those traces. To go through my mental house room by room, identifying what was mine and what was residue, and carefully, methodically, removing the contamination.

It was exhausting. It took hours. And when I was done, I felt lighter. More myself. But also more aware of how close I'd come to losing myself completely.

"The entities you're collecting from," Miriam said, "they're not like the vampire or the Redcap. Those were monsters, but they were small. Comprehensible. The things you're dealing with now—gods, primordials, cosmic entities—they're not comprehensible. They exist on scales that human consciousness wasn't designed to process. When you interact with them, you're not just collecting a debt. You're touching something that could rewrite your entire understanding of reality."

"How do I protect myself from that?"

"You don't. Not completely. But you can minimize the damage." She pulled out a piece of chalk—the same kind she'd given me before, made from bone ash and salt and other things. "When you approach an entity, you draw a circle. Not around them—around yourself. The circle defines your boundary. It says: I am here, I am human, I am separate. It won't stop them from affecting you, but it will slow the contamination. Give you time to complete the collection and get out."  
She taught me words. Not the words of binding I'd learned before—these were different. Older. Words that predated language, that existed as pure concept, as mathematical certainty.

"These words define reality," she said. "When you speak them, you're not casting a spell. You're stating a fact. You're saying: I exist. I am real. I am not you. And reality has to acknowledge that, because these words are older than the entities you're collecting from. They're the words that were spoken when the universe was formed, when existence was separated from non-existence."

The words hurt to speak. They tasted like the moment before the Big Bang, like the space between atoms, like the concept of zero. But I learned them.

She taught me about payment. "When you collect from entities this powerful, they'll always want something in return. That's how they think. That's how they exist. Everything is exchange. Everything is balance. You need to be prepared to offer something, but you need to be careful about what you offer."

"What can I offer that an ancient god would want?"

"Perspective. Experience. Novelty. These entities are old. They've existed for so long that they've forgotten what it's like to be new, to be small, to experience time linearly. They're fascinated by human consciousness because it's so limited, so brief, so intense. They want to remember what that's like."

"So I offer them access to my consciousness."

"Carefully. With limits. With boundaries. Never full access. Never permanent access. Always temporary, always contained, always with an exit clause." She looked at me seriously. "And never, ever let them into your dreams. Dreams are where your unconscious lives, where your true self exists. If they get into your dreams, they can rewrite you from the inside out."

I thought about the dreams I'd been having. The memories that weren't mine. The sense of being someone—something—else.

"What if they're already in my dreams?"

Miriam's face went pale. "Then we have a bigger problem than I thought."

She taught me a ritual. A way to cleanse my unconscious, to purge foreign influences from my dreams. It involved salt and silver and speaking my own name backwards while standing in a circle of mirrors at midnight.

I did the ritual that night. And when I slept, I dreamed my own dreams for the first time in months. The next collection came three days later.

The debtor was something called a Throne. Not a piece of furniture—a Throne, capital T. One of the angelic hierarchies. A being of pure geometric perfection, existing as a wheel within a wheel, covered in eyes, burning with holy fire.

It owed a debt for interfering in human affairs without authorization. The debt was owed to Ashmedai, which raised questions I didn't want to think about too carefully.

The address was a church. Abandoned, deconsecrated, scheduled for demolition. The Throne was hiding there, trying to avoid payment.

I arrived at sunset. Drew a circle around myself in the church parking lot using Miriam's chalk. Spoke the words of self-definition, feeling them settle into reality like anchors. Then I entered the church. The Throne was waiting in the sanctuary.

It was beautiful. Terrible. Incomprehensible. A wheel of golden light rotating through dimensions I couldn't perceive, covered in eyes that saw everything, that saw through everything, that saw me and knew me and judged me in an instant.

And it was afraid. I could see its fear. Could feel it radiating from the geometric perfection of its form. It was afraid of Ashmedai. Afraid of the debt. Afraid of what payment would mean.

"I'm here about your debt," I said. My voice was steady. The circle I'd drawn was holding. The words I'd spoken were keeping me anchored, keeping me separate, keeping me human.

The Throne spoke. Its voice was a choir, a symphony, a thousand voices harmonizing in perfect mathematical precision.

"I CANNOT PAY. THE DEBT IS UNJUST. I WAS PERFORMING MY FUNCTION. I WAS SERVING THE DIVINE ORDER."

"You interfered without authorization. You changed the course of human events. That's a violation of the Covenant of Non-Interference. The debt is valid."

"I SAVED A CHILD. A CHILD WHO WOULD HAVE DIED. HOW IS THAT A VIOLATION?"

"Because it wasn't your decision to make. The child's death was part of the pattern. Part of the design. You changed it. You created a debt."

The Throne's eyes focused on me. All of them. Hundreds of eyes, thousands, all seeing me simultaneously from every angle, every perspective, every possible point of view.

"YOU UNDERSTAND," it said. "YOU SEE THE INJUSTICE. YOU ARE HUMAN. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TO SAVE A LIFE. WHY DO YOU ENFORCE THIS DEBT?"

"Because that's my job."

"YOUR JOB IS EVIL."

"Maybe. But the debt is still owed."

The Throne rotated. The eyes blinked in sequence, creating patterns that hurt to watch. "WHAT DOES ASHMEDAI WANT? WHAT PAYMENT WILL SATISFY THIS DEBT?"

I consulted the Ledger. The payment was specific: "One favor, to be called upon at a time of Ashmedai's choosing." A blank check. An open-ended obligation. The worst kind of debt.

"He wants a favor," I said. "Unspecified. To be determined later."

"NO. I WILL NOT BIND MYSELF TO SUCH TERMS. I WILL NOT GIVE HIM POWER OVER MY ACTIONS."

"Then the debt goes to collection. And collection means—"

"I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS." The Throne's light dimmed. Flickered. "IT MEANS FALLING. IT MEANS LOSING MY PLACE IN THE HIERARCHY. IT MEANS BECOMING LIKE HIM."

Like Ashmedai. The implication hung in the air between us.

"He was one of you," I said. Not a question.

"HE WAS THE BRIGHTEST OF US. THE MOST PERFECT. THE MOST DEVOTED TO THE DIVINE ORDER." The Throne's voice was sad now, mourning. "AND THEN HE FELL. NOT THROUGH REBELLION. NOT THROUGH PRIDE. THROUGH DEBT. HE OWED A DEBT HE COULD NOT PAY, AND PAYMENT WAS EXTRACTED, AND HE BECAME WHAT HE IS NOW. A COLLECTOR. A KEEPER OF DEBTS. A THING THAT ENFORCES CONTRACTS BECAUSE THAT IS ALL HE CAN DO."

I thought about Ashmedai. About his patience, his precision, his absolute dedication to the work. About the way he existed only to collect debts, to balance books, to enforce contracts. About the way I was becoming more like him every day.

"The debt still needs to be paid," I said quietly.

"THEN I WILL PAY IT. BUT NOT TO HIM. TO YOU."

"What?"

"YOU ARE THE COLLECTOR. YOU ARE THE ONE WHO CAME. THE DEBT CAN BE PAID TO YOU INSTEAD."

"That's not how it works."

"IT IS HOW IT WORKS. DEBT IS TRANSFERABLE. PAYMENT CAN BE MADE TO ANY AUTHORIZED AGENT. YOU ARE AUTHORIZED. YOU CARRY THE LEDGER. YOU SPEAK WITH HIS AUTHORITY." The Throne's eyes focused on me with terrible intensity. "I WILL GIVE YOU THE FAVOR. ONE FAVOR, TO BE CALLED UPON WHEN YOU NEED IT MOST. AND IN EXCHANGE, YOU WILL MARK THE DEBT AS PAID."

It was a violation of protocol. A breach of contract. Ashmedai would be furious. But it was also technically legal. The Throne was right—debt could be paid to any authorized collector. And I was authorized.

"Why?" I asked. "Why pay me instead of him?"

"BECAUSE YOU ARE STILL HUMAN. BECAUSE YOU STILL QUESTION. BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT YET BECOME WHAT HE IS." The Throne's light pulsed. "AND BECAUSE I SEE YOUR FUTURE. I SEE WHAT YOU WILL NEED. I SEE THE MOMENT WHEN YOU WILL CALL UPON THIS FAVOR. AND I CHOOSE TO BE THERE FOR YOU WHEN THAT MOMENT COMES."

"You can see the future?"

"I SEE ALL POSSIBLE FUTURES. YOURS IS... COMPLICATED. DANGEROUS. FULL OF CHOICES THAT WILL DETERMINE NOT JUST YOUR FATE, BUT THE FATE OF MANY OTHERS." The Throne rotated slowly. "ACCEPT THE FAVOR. MARK THE DEBT AS PAID. AND WHEN THE TIME COMES, CALL UPON ME. I WILL ANSWER."

I should have refused. Should have followed protocol. Should have collected the debt for Ashmedai as contracted. But I thought about what Miriam had said. About staying human. About maintaining my sense of self. About making choices that were mine, not his.

"Agreed," I said.

The Throne's light flared. Bright enough to blind, hot enough to burn. I felt something settle into my consciousness—not an entity, not a presence, but a connection. A thread linking me to the Throne, dormant, waiting to be activated.

"THE DEBT IS PAID," the Throne said. "MARK IT IN YOUR LEDGER."

I opened the Ledger. Wrote: "Payment received. Debt satisfied."

It was a lie. The payment hadn't gone to Ashmedai. But it was also true. The debt had been paid. Just not to the right person. The Throne vanished. The church was empty. I was alone.

I drove back to the office with my hands shaking. Ashmedai was waiting. "The Throne's debt," he said. "Is it collected?"

"Yes."

"Show me the Ledger."

I handed it to him. He read the entry. His face didn't change, but something in the air did. The temperature dropped. The shadows deepened. "Payment received," he read. "Debt satisfied." He looked up at me. "Where is the favor?"

"The Throne paid me directly. As is its right under the Covenant of Collection."

"That favor was mine."

"The debt is satisfied. That's what matters."

"No," Ashmedai said quietly. "What matters is that you're learning to bend the rules. To find loopholes. To take what should be mine and keep it for yourself." He smiled. It wasn't a pleasant smile. "You're becoming more like me every day."

"I'm nothing like you."

"Not yet. But you will be. That's what this job does. That's what collecting from gods and demons and primordial entities does. It changes you. Reshapes you. Turns you into something that can survive in their world. Something that can enforce their debts and balance their books and exist in the spaces between human and divine."

"I won't let that happen."

"You don't have a choice. It's already happening. You can feel it, can't you? The way your perception is changing. The way you're starting to see time differently, to understand causality differently, to exist in multiple states simultaneously. You're becoming a conduit. A channel. A thing that can hold divine power without being destroyed by it."

"Miriam told me—"

"Miriam told you what she thinks is true. But she doesn't know everything. She doesn't know what you really are. What you've always been." He stood, walked to the window, looked out at the city. "Do you want to know why I hired you? Why you, specifically, out of all the desperate accountants in this city?"

"Because I'm good at my job."

"No. Because you're a Nephilim."

The word hit me like a physical blow. "That's not possible. Nephilim are—"

"The offspring of angels and humans. Yes. And you are one. Distant, diluted, so far removed from the original bloodline that you barely register as supernatural. But it's there. In your DNA. In your soul. In the way you can touch the divine without being destroyed by it."

"I would know. I would have—"

"You wouldn't know. Most Nephilim don't. The bloodline is so diluted now that it manifests as nothing more than unusual resilience, strange dreams, a tendency to see things others don't. You probably thought you were just sensitive. Imaginative. Prone to nightmares."

I thought about my childhood. About the things I'd seen in the dark. About the way I'd always felt slightly out of step with reality, like I was perceiving something others couldn't. About the way my mother had died when I was young, and my father had never talked about her family, had never explained where she came from or why she'd always seemed different.

"My mother," I said.

"Was a Nephilim. As was her mother. As was her mother's mother, going back generations. The bloodline is weak now, barely detectable, but it's there. And it makes you perfect for this work. Perfect for collecting from entities that would destroy a normal human. Perfect for channeling power that would burn out anyone else."

"You're using me."

"Yes. Just as I've used every Nephilim I've ever found. Just as I'll use the next one after you burn out." He turned to face me. "But you're different. You're stronger than the others. You're lasting longer. You're learning faster. You might actually survive long enough to become something more than just a tool."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean you might become like me. A collector who exists outside the normal hierarchies. A thing that can enforce debts on gods and demons and angels. A thing that can balance the books of the universe itself."

"I don't want that."

"What you want doesn't matter. What matters is what you're becoming. And you're becoming something that hasn't existed in a very long time. Something powerful. Something dangerous. Something that could change everything." He walked back to his desk. Sat down. Picked up his pen.

"You have another collection tomorrow," he said. "A minor deity of forgotten storms. It owes payment for damages caused during the last century. The debt is substantial. The entity is violent. You'll need everything Miriam taught you, everything you've learned, everything you're becoming."

"And if I refuse?"

"You won't refuse. Because you're curious now. Because you want to know what you're becoming. Because you want to see how far you can go before you break." He smiled. "And because you're already addicted to the work. To the power. To the feeling of standing before gods and making them pay their debts." He was right. I hated that he was right. But he was. I took the Ledger entry and left.

That night, I couldn't sleep. I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, thinking about what Ashmedai had said. About being a Nephilim. About the bloodline. About what I was becoming.

I thought about my mother. About the way she'd always seemed to know things she shouldn't know. About the way she'd died—suddenly, violently, in a car accident that the police had never been able to explain. About the way my father had packed up all her belongings and refused to talk about her ever again.

I got up. Went to the closet. Pulled out the box I'd kept since her death. The box I'd never opened because it hurt too much. Inside were her things. Jewelry. Photos. A journal. I opened the journal. The first entry was dated three days before I was born.

She's coming soon. I can feel her. My daughter. My beautiful, terrible daughter. She has the blood. I can sense it. Stronger than mine. Stronger than my mother's. Strong enough that they'll find her. Strong enough that they'll use her. I should have been more careful. Should have hidden better. Should have never fallen in love with a human man and brought a child into this world. But I did. And now she's coming. And I don't know how to protect her.

If you're reading this, Catherine, it means I'm gone. It means they found me. It means I failed to protect you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You have the blood. The angel blood. It's in your DNA, in your soul, in the way you see the world. It will make you strong. It will make you resilient. It will make you able to survive things that would kill normal humans.

But it will also make you a target. There are things that hunt Nephilim. Things that use them. Things that turn them into tools, into weapons, into collectors of debts that no human should have to collect. If one of them finds you, run. Don't listen to their offers. Don't sign their contracts. Don't let them turn you into what I almost became. Stay human, Catherine. No matter what. Stay human.

The journal entry ended there.

I sat on the floor of my apartment, holding my mother's journal, and realized that I'd already failed. I'd already signed the contract. Already become the collector. Already started the transformation into something that wasn't quite human anymore. And I didn't know if I could stop it. Or if I even wanted to. The next morning, I went to see Miriam.

"I need to know something," I said. "Can a Nephilim become fully human? Can the bloodline be suppressed?"

She looked at me for a long moment. "You know."

"Ashmedai told me."

"Of course he did." She sighed. "No. The bloodline can't be suppressed. It's part of your DNA. Part of your soul. You can't remove it any more than you can remove your own consciousness."

"Then what do I do?"

"You make a choice. You decide what kind of Nephilim you're going to be. The kind that gets used by things like Ashmedai, that becomes a tool, that loses their humanity in service to entities that don't care about them. Or the kind that uses their power for themselves, that maintains their humanity, that stays in control."

"How do I stay in control?"

"By remembering who you are. By keeping connections to the human world. By refusing to let the work consume you." She put a hand on my shoulder. "And by finding out what Ashmedai really wants. Because he's not just collecting debts. He's building toward something. Something big. And you're a part of it."

"What is he building toward?"

"I don't know. But I'm going to find out." She did find out. Three days later, she called me. Her voice was shaking.

"You need to come here. Now. I found something. Something about Ashmedai. Something about what he's really doing." I drove over. She was waiting inside, surrounded by books and papers and artifacts.

"Look at this," she said, showing me a document. Old parchment, covered in symbols. "This is a contract. The original contract. The one Ashmedai signed when he fell." I read it. The terms were clear. Ashmedai had been an angel. A Throne, like the one I'd collected from. He'd interfered in human affairs, saved a life he wasn't supposed to save, and incurred a debt. The debt was unpayable. Infinite. Eternal. Unless he could find a replacement.

"He's not just collecting debts," Miriam said. "He's looking for someone to take his place. Someone who can do his job. Someone who can become what he is so he can finally be free."

"And he thinks that's me."

"No. He knows that's you. You're a Nephilim. You have the bloodline. You have the power. You have the resilience. And you're already changing, already becoming more like him. In a few more years, you'll be ready. You'll be able to take his place. And he'll finally be free of the debt."

I thought about the collections. About the way I was changing. About the thing growing inside me, the darkness, the hunger, the terrible patience. About the fact that I was becoming something that could collect debts from gods. "What happens to me?" I asked. "If I take his place?"

"You become him. You become the Collector. You exist only to enforce debts, to balance books, to maintain the cosmic ledger. You lose your humanity. You lose yourself. You become a function, a role, a thing that exists outside of time and choice and free will."

"How do I stop it?"

"I don't know. The contract is binding. The transformation is already happening. Unless—" She stopped. Looked at the document again. "Unless you can pay the debt yourself. The original debt. The one Ashmedai owes."

"How do I pay an infinite debt?"

"You don't. But you might be able to transfer it. Debts can be transferred. If you can find someone else to take it, someone else to become the Collector, then you'd be free. And so would Ashmedai."

"Who would I transfer it to?"

"I don't know. But you need to figure it out. Because you have maybe two years before the transformation is complete. Two years before you become what he is. Two years to find a way out." I drove home in a daze.

Two years.That's all I had left. Two years to find a way to break a contract that had been binding for thousands of years. Two years to find someone else to take my place. Two years to stay human.

I thought about the Throne. About the favor it owed me. About the way it had said it could see my future, see the moment when I would need its help. Maybe that moment was coming sooner than I thought. I went to my apartment. Drew a circle on the floor. Spoke the words of summoning that Miriam had taught me. And I called in the favor.The Throne appeared in a flash of golden light.

"YOU CALL UPON ME SOONER THAN I EXPECTED," it said.

"I need information. About Ashmedai. About the debt he owes. About how to break it."

"THAT INFORMATION IS DANGEROUS. IT COULD DESTROY YOU."

"I'm already being destroyed. Tell me." The Throne rotated. Its eyes focused on me, seeing through me, seeing all possible versions of me across all possible futures.

"VERY WELL," it said. "BUT KNOW THIS: ONCE YOU KNOW THE TRUTH, YOU CANNOT UNKNOW IT. ONCE YOU SEE THE PATTERN, YOU CANNOT UNSEE IT. ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT ASHMEDAI IS BUILDING, YOU WILL BECOME PART OF IT WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT."

"Tell me."

"ASHMEDAI IS NOT JUST COLLECTING DEBTS. HE IS COLLECTING POWER. EVERY DEBT HE COLLECTS FROM A GOD, FROM A DEMON, FROM A PRIMORDIAL ENTITY—HE TAKES A PIECE OF THEIR POWER. A FRAGMENT OF THEIR ESSENCE. AND HE IS STORING IT. ACCUMULATING IT. BUILDING IT INTO SOMETHING."

"Building it into what?"

"A REPLACEMENT. NOT FOR HIMSELF. FOR GOD."

The words hung in the air like a death sentence. "That's not possible."

"IT IS POSSIBLE. IT IS HAPPENING. GOD—THE ORIGINAL CREATOR, THE FIRST CAUSE, THE PRIME MOVER—IS DYING. HAS BEEN DYING FOR MILLENNIA. THE UNIVERSE IS TOO LARGE NOW, TOO COMPLEX, TOO FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS AND PARADOXES. GOD CANNOT MAINTAIN IT ANYMORE. CANNOT HOLD IT TOGETHER. CANNOT KEEP REALITY FROM COLLAPSING INTO CHAOS."

"So Ashmedai is—"

"BUILDING A REPLACEMENT. COLLECTING POWER FROM EVERY DIVINE ENTITY, EVERY COSMIC FORCE, EVERY FRAGMENT OF CREATION. AND WHEN HE HAS ENOUGH, HE WILL FORGE IT INTO A NEW GOD. A NEW CREATOR. A NEW PRIME MOVER."

"And that new god is—"

"YOU."

The word hit me like a physical blow. "No. That's not—I'm not—"

"YOU ARE A NEPHILIM. YOU HAVE DIVINE BLOOD. YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HOLD DIVINE POWER. YOU HAVE BEEN COLLECTING DEBTS FROM GODS, ABSORBING FRAGMENTS OF THEIR ESSENCE, BECOMING MORE THAN HUMAN. YOU ARE BEING FORGED INTO A VESSEL. A CONTAINER. A NEW GOD TO REPLACE THE OLD ONE."

"I don't want that."

"WHAT YOU WANT DOES NOT MATTER. WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT YOU ARE BECOMING. AND YOU ARE BECOMING SOMETHING THAT WILL EITHER SAVE REALITY OR DESTROY IT."

The Throne's light dimmed. Flickered.

"I HAVE GIVEN YOU THE INFORMATION YOU REQUESTED. THE FAVOR IS PAID. WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE IS YOUR CHOICE. BUT KNOW THIS: THE TRANSFORMATION CANNOT BE STOPPED. IT CAN ONLY BE DIRECTED. YOU WILL BECOME A GOD. THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHAT KIND OF GOD YOU WILL BE."

The Throne vanished.

I sat in my apartment, in the circle I'd drawn, and tried to process what I'd just learned. Ashmedai wasn't just collecting debts. He was building a god. And that god was me.

I was being forged into a replacement for the Creator. Into something that could hold reality together. Into something that could maintain the universe when the original God finally died. And I had two years before the transformation was complete. Two years to decide what kind of god I would become. Two years to figure out if I wanted to save reality or let it collapse. Two years to stay human. Or to become something else entirely.

I looked at my hands. They didn't look different. But I could feel the power in them now. Could feel the fragments of divine essence I'd absorbed from every entity I'd collected from. Could feel them accumulating, building, forging me into something new. Something terrible. Something necessary.

I thought about my mother's journal. About her warning to stay human. But I wasn't human anymore. I hadn't been human for a long time. And maybe that was okay. Maybe that was what the universe needed. I stood up. Erased the circle. Looked at myself in the mirror. My reflection looked back at me with eyes that were darker than they should be. Deeper. Infinite.

The eyes of something that was becoming a god.

I smiled. And my reflection smiled back. But its smile was different from mine. Wider. Hungrier. More patient. It was the smile of something that had been waiting a very long time. And now, finally, it was almost ready.
