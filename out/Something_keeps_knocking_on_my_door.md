I've recently been experiencing knocks on my door, and it has me scared so much

We have two houses, I reside in the second floor of the other house, away from the rest of my family

Normally, when I get knocks from the middle of the night, it would be my family telling me to come and eat because they bought food

Until it wasn't, at first I thought it was pranks, until it occured more and more, where I receive knocks, I open door, and there was nothing there

It would be fine if it was daylight, but it would be something else deep of the night

It was after this that I made it so that I'll only open the door after asking who it is outside and someone answers


And well.... It worked.... For awhile that is


During the visit of my girlfriend, after we had gotten to bed and slept, I woke up to the sound of knocking on my door, girlfriend still sleeping beside me

And it was my grandfather, or atleast his voice

I was about to open the door until I came to a realization that it's impossible for it to be my grandfather

My grandfather has trouble walking, he literally asks for help just to go upstairs, more on, he had no reasons to come up at such a late time

So I stayed quiet, while the knocks kept getting louder and louder and the voice became angrier, until it eventually stopped

I couldn't sleep that night, I was afraid that something might come in, and hurt me and my girlfriend

So I just readied a pair of scissors on my bedside table and watched youtube to keep myself awake

Around morning, I asked my girlfriend if she heard the knocks, and she said no, so maybe it was just a nightmare, but it was too real for me to be a nightmare

Then I remembered that watched a youtube video to keep myself awake, and I viewed my History, and it was there

So either I was sleepwalking with my mind awake while dreaming, or what I experienced was real

After that, I felt so paranoid, I don't even know if the one knocking is my family or not, like, how can I know?? They can literally mimic the voice of people


Fast forward, A day after my girlfriend left to go back to her home, just yesterday, I was reviewing for a very important exam in our living room

We have a living room just outside my room, and then a terrace right next to it

I was reviewing for an exam when I heard a knock come from the terrace, and looking at the window, I saw an arm peeking out slightly from the side, it was extremely pale white, it's like someone covered themselves with chalk powder

But at that time, I was so sad because I fought with my girlfriend that I paid no mind to it, until I eventually came to my senses and retreated to my room

If it was daylight, I could maybe deal with it, but night is a different story, nobody would hear me scream, and that scared me

Well, Come daylight, I closed the window blinds and made sure that the door was locked, and I realized something

As to why they could always knock on my door

The terrace door was broken, it's door knob was broken so it can never be locked, meaning, I was literally studying for an exam with an entity outside that can come in at any moment, but just chose not to



Earlier, I talked with my girlfriend and I mentioned this, and she told me that she experienced the knocks too while I was away for the day

Someone would knock, she'd open thinking it was me, but it was no one, and then recalled to me that there were times where she told me that someone was at the door only for me to open it to no one


Well, while I was talking with her earlier, someone knocked at the door once again, I asked who it was and no one answered, so now I'm here with a cutter blade beside me, afraid and shaking

She asked me to play christian songs and it helped a litte Planetshakers and Hillsong Music helps

Right now, I'm in my room shaking with fear as I write this, because I never experienced something like this in my life

I just keep hoping that morning comes soon, I can't sleep, I don't want to sleep out of fear of something happening

It's honestly very scary
