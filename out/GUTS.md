When I was a teenager, I read Chuck Palahniuk's short story, Guts, in which the main character would get off in his pool by sitting on the inlet port at the bottom.   
  
  
He'd let it suck his ass until he came, and he did it over and over until one day, the lesson simply couldn't wait to be taught: the suction tugged on the connected organs and he lost a lot of intestine. His little jizz pearls left in the pool ended up impregnating his sister and resulted in abortion.  
  
  
I was a teenager. This was groundbreaking -- horrific, novel, and yes, a little sexy. Well, a little sexy turned into a lot sexy one drunken night in college, friends and friends-of-friends piling into the hot tubs. And I honestly just wish that it sucked out my intestines like the Guts guy, and that was the worst of it. A colostomy bag instead of emotional scars cut deep into the fabric of who I am.  
  
  
I'd introduce myself but that seems pretty trite nowadays. It doesn't matter who I am, doesn't matter who you are. There is nothing that matters because I know the truth. I know how un-alone we are, as humans and not just individuals.  
  
  
Let's rewind.  
  


Five years ago, my parents “left me in charge” of the house for summer break, which really just meant that this year was like any other and they weren't going to spend time with me. God forbid, they talked to their son, or even looked at him. But don't worry, what they lacked in care and relationships, they made up for in material things.  
  
  
So I had a huge house with extravagant, almost funny amounts of pools and hot tubs on the screened-in, massive patio. Was I lonely? I mean, maybe. Probably. But when you're eighteen and have full awareness of how fucking cool having this shit made you, I felt like it leveled me out.  
  
  
“Dude,” slurred Bradley, the wiry-yet-soft-tittied guy i've known my whole life. He had a hot girl I'd never seen before draped in his arms as she clasped around his neck. “You gotta do this more often!”  
  
  
The hottie leaned in and started to nibble his ear, whispering something that pinked Bradley's cheeks. I chuckled as I migrated over to the other side of the ten-seater tub to give them some privacy.“Makes you aware of how 'by yourself' you are when they get like that, doesn't it?” a voice said, closer in proximity than I expected. I turned and saw her: fiery red hair, a nice pair of DSLs and an ass to match.  
  
  
I'm still not totally sure how we got these babes to come over, but I mean, they were friends-of-friends (I think) with one of our dorm mates. And they were sexy. And they chose to be half-nude and drunk with us. Yeah, I'm aware this sounds more like a wet dream than something I'd rather get my intestines resectioned than my dick sucked. I guess some things really can't be glossed over by hotness.  
  
  
Back to the scene-setting.  
  
  
“Uh, yeah, I guess,” I sagely responded. Redhead Babe scooted to the edge of her little tub, and I did the same. She was smiling at me-- a relatively new experience with girls. I saw her tits sitting on the rim, and felt my own grin break out.  
  
  
“I'm Sierra,” she said, and we awkwardly shook hands. When I went to take my hand back, she held on tighter. “Wait! How 'bout you come over to my tub?”  
  
  
She was in a one-seater. My mind was running as crunk as it does when you're eighteen and drank seven Four Lokos within an hour. And she knew what she was doing.  
  
  
“Yeah, I'll hop on over,” I said and stumbled gracelessly out of the large hot tub and into Sierra's.  
  
  
Settling down into the bubbling water, she draped herself across me and I felt myself chubbing up. Wrapping an arm around me, I thought she was about to kiss me, but she reached for a red cup behind my head.  
  
  
“Take a sip, Gabe,” she cooed. I saw her knocking back a similar cup, and was already enticed by her interest in me and the fact that she couldn't seem to keep her hands to herself. I didn't even think twice before I lost myself in the drink.  
  
  
Things heated up, I'll spare you too many details. It was a great hookup, to that point. When my head got heavy and dreamy though, I stopped having so much fun. “S-Sierra,” I slurred. This wasn't just the Four Lokos that had me feeling like I was drowning. I needed some air.  
  
  
Flash.  
  
  
I thought I saw something. Like, something fucking wild. For just a split second, with my head swimming dizzily, Sierra's red hair created an infernal halo around her severe face, her teeth sharp and jagged. She looked deranged, absolutely unhinged. My body stiffened reflexively, and she slowed down.  
  
  
Pulling away to look at me, Sierra asked, “What's wrong, Gabriel?”  
  
  
She looked heavenly again, smiling slyly at me as she ground back down on my dick. Dazed as I was, I let it go and gave myself back to the moment.  
  
  
Slowly, we inched closer to the hot tub jets. Sierra had me right over one as she rode me, a surprising sensation that I enjoyed.  
  
  
Until I felt one of her arms leave me to roam the hot tub wall, and I saw Sierra touch a switch I don't remember ever seeing before. Not that that's so notable, living in the house that I do. There was too much for anyone to really enjoy and appreciate.  
  
  
You know how I told you Guts was impactful? So was that damn switch. I don't know how it happened, but she must've reversed the flow. Instead of blowing bubbles through the jets, it created a suction force. Sierra was grinding on my johnson and with the sucking on my ass, I knew I was going to cum fast.  
  
  
As I approached climax, I felt the suction pull harder on my ass. It was too hard, but she just kept going so I kept going.  
  
  
And I know how crazy this sounds. But as I came, girl fully still on top and me still fully inside, I felt a licking sensation on my ass.  
  
  
Immediately (or as quickly as my drunk self could manage), I booted Sierra off my lap and yeeted myself from the hot tub. Palahniuk didn't mention licking. This was too far.  
  
  
I ran toward my house, towel hastily thrown on my body with my hand clamping my ass. I felt a small tag. From my butt.  
  
  
I know now it was a small part of my intestine – I think I knew it even then, I was thinking of Guts as I shuffled to my house.  
  


In the yard, in the one-seater, I saw Sierra didn't mind – I don't think she even noticed my absence. In that tub, the fiery image of a hellish siren was back. This time, her belly was full of moonlight, glowing bright in the dark of night. She rubbed her tummy as she grinned with sharpened teeth at me.
