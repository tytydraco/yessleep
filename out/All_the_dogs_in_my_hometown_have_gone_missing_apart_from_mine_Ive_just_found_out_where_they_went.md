Jess was my best friend, not that I had many to choose from. We were inseparable. I spent all last summer exploring the woods around my house with her, leaving before noon and not coming back until near sundown. We found secret paths, looked for cool sticks and uncovered a waterfall that only we knew about. It felt like the time of childhood foretold in 80s coming of age films. I really wouldn't have spent those months any other way, even if I had the choice. There was no one I'd rather spend my time with. She often had the same gloomy mood as I did, but when she was outside she'd come alive, and invite me to join her. But my friendship with Jess wasn't confined just to the summer months. Throughout the year, she'd accompany me wherever I'd go, be it out to the stores or on a walk through the woods. I'd talk to her endlessly about my thoughts, dreams and countless plans for the future. She'd always listen to me, even when no-one else did. I could tell her all my secrets, and did, with the insurance that she would never spread rumours.    

Jess was a Spaniel-Collie mix. My parents got her for me on my sixth birthday, when it became exceedingly clear I wasn't equipped to make friends at school. My dad especially had grandiose plans of me being in a “one boy and his dog” situation, and I suppose his wish came true. I rarely see my father after my parents divorced, since he now lives out of state. My mother is seeing this guy, Gary, who recently moved in with us. He brought his infant daughter, Sue, with him. My routine of staying in my room and listening to music at full volume is now to block the sounds of a baby crying, rather than arguing. Gary is a nice guy and all, but is struck with laziness and leaves Sue with my mom all day while he goes out and “works”. I'm not entirely sure what he does while he's out all day, I'm not sure if my mother does either, but whatever it is it's barely enough for us to scrape by. 

Apart from my mom, there was no one I loved more than Jess. She really was my best friend and closest companion. I loved when she'd collapse onto her side with her legs in the air, silently begging for me to tickle her tummy. I did often, and made sure to brush her black and white coat too. I wondered if I smelled like dog. I didn't really talk to anyone at school, certainly no one that would point out if I did, and my mother would surely be used to the smell at this point. I wasn't bullied at school, just ignored. Sometimes I thought that was worse, since at least if I was getting picked on, I'd get some people's sympathy. But I just floated through school like a wrapper caught in the wind, lacking the self esteem to ever even ask what page we're on. I didn't care though, not outwardly at least. As long as I had Jess by my side for the rest of the day, I was fine. It was because of this that I was terrified of ever losing Jess. She was almost eight by this point, and only had another five years, tops, left in her. I dreaded that day, and wanted to postpone even thinking about it as long as I could. Sometimes, I laid awake in bed at night thinking of what would happen if she ever disappeared. This was a constant worry for two reasons. 

The first was Gary. As soon as he moved in with us, he demanded that Jess be rehomed. For Sue's safety, he reasoned. At first, my mother went along with him, until I started crying and didn't stop until they both agreed I could keep her. There were a few conditions that mostly resulted in Jess spending her time in my room, which I didn't mind. She slept on a mat strewn across the end of my bed anyway. Once I moved her bowls for water and chow in, Gary seemed to lay off. That was all behind us now, for the most part, but I was still afraid that Sue could provoke Jess into nipping at her, which would lead to her being put down. These thoughts paralysed me with anxiety, especially when Gary would joke about just that happening at the dinner table. The other reason was the recent spate of disappearances. Posters for missing dogs were now bound to almost every lamppost, utility pole and novelty tree across town. It has been like this for as long as I could remember. When I was younger, a cop came in during a school assembly to give us a lecture on properly looking after our pets. That didn't seem to help matters and the disappearances kept mounting. I was now certain that there was a dog kidnapper operating locally, maybe a whole ring. This theory led me to never letting Jess out of my sight. 

It was on a warm summer's morning that Gary informed me the neighbour's dog had gone missing the day before. I felt a cold pit form in my stomach. I was ambushed by thoughts of Jess being bundled into a van, only to be sold off to some abusive or neglectful family. Worse, she might end up as a guard dog for some methheads. In my mind, any outcome was possible. The fact that she was so close to being dognapped was crushing. I thought about it all day, trying to listen to music to take my mind off it. Eventually, I decided to talk to the neighbour in question - Mrs Beverly. I went downstairs and into the living room to grab my charging phone, not wanting it to be out in the open when my mother came back from the store. She had a habit of reading through my messages. I looked out the wide window with a view of the backyard as I checked the percentage. Sue still frolicked, as she had been doing since the morning, and Gary had retreated to his mancave, which had once been my father's toolshed. Nestled in the other corner of the lawn was the old doghouse. Jess slept out there for years, until I had to relocate her to my room. Despite the rotting, waterlogged wood, it still hadJess's scent. Sometimes, she'd run into it when I let her out into the yard, and curl up as she had done when she was a pup. The thing was an eyesore now, and Gary regularly promised to dismantle it, but had never gotten around to it.
 
Mrs Beverly was a kind old woman, one who sincerely loved children. When I was younger, she'd put me to work in her messy yard and pay me in ribbon candy. Her husband was dead and her daughter had moved away long ago. She sometimes mistook me for her daughter as we apparently both had long blonde hair, which was something I wasn't entirely annoyed about. On this particular day, however, she was graced with clarity and said “Oh, hello Ben” when she answered the door after the third knock. 

Her house smelled of boiled vegetation. The odor hit me as soon as the door opened, and made me turn down the old woman's invite inside. I told her I just wanted to talk about her dog, and she suddenly turned very sombre. 

“Oh my, it's terrible. My Percy ran off yesterday morning and hasn't been back since. He can't survive out there on his own,” she said. 

“What type of dog was Percy?” I asked. 

“He's a Pekingese. Addison loved cuddling him when she was your age. He was like a teddy bear come to life,” the old woman said, reminiscing. 

Percy was an old, housebound dog. Even if he tried to run off, its stubby, borderline atrophied legs wouldn't have taken it far.

“When did you notice he was gone?” I said, “did you let him outside?”

“Oh heavens no,” Mrs Beverly replied, “no, no, I never let Percy out. He relieved himself in his tray and slept on a cushion in the living room.”

I considered what she said, but before I could ask another question, she spoke again.

“I just woke up and he was gone.”

I thanked Mrs Beverly for her time, unsure of what else to quiz her on. She smiled, just happy for the human contact, and closed the door. I walked the short distance back home as my mother's car appeared on the brow of the hill, and pulled into our garage just as I arrived at my front door. I helped her carry groceries to the kitchen, and she talked about an old friend she met at the deli counter as we sorted the food away. She asked me what I was doing at Ms Beverly's and I told her I was just checking in to see how she was after her dog ran off. She applauded my thoughtfulness and asked if everything was ok. I told her the old woman was distraught, but hopeful,  and we left the conversation at that. The rest of the day flew by like any other, as did the first half of the next day. Jess was restless since I didn't let her out for a runaround the day before. I knew a walk would do her good, and fought my laziness as I looked around for the leash. I eventually found it on the kitchen counter and shouted that I was going out for a bit, hoping my mother would hear. I attached the business end toJess's worn, red collar and led her outside.

Not far from my house was a trail, one that led deep into the surrounding woodland. I walked it regularly with Jess, as it gave us both a nice stretch of the legs. It was never too busy, even during the summer months, as most committed hikers stuck to the well marked and maintained trail through the adjacent mountains. I enjoyed the lack of crowds, and always kept my head down whenever I did pass someone. I often ventured off the trail with Jess, preferring to explore the dense woods. Today, however, I decided to stick to the path. Jess pulled and whined, unused to being leashed for this long. We still hadn't passed anyone, and the only other sounds that accompanied our footsteps was the bird song, and the natural hum of the forest. Again, Jess tugged on the leash, likely wanting to chase a freshly spotted squirrel. 

“Come on Jessy,” I said to the dog, “calm down.” 

As if in response, the leash went slack and she returned to a gentle pace by my side. I leant as I walked, giving her a generous scratch behind her ears and around her neck. Her tail began to wag once more and we continued our walk as normal. A little further up, we passed someone. It was an old man I only vaguely recognised, and recalled after the fact that his name was Stephen. Or rather, Father Stephen. He was in his 90s, but walked as regularly as I did. A testament to a quiet life I suppose. We walked near each other, and I awkwardly nodded my acknowledgement to him. He didn't catch my eye contact and walked passed without so much as looking at me. I slouched and continued up the trail. 

Jess and I were flanked by birch trees, pale and spindly. This neck of the woods was littered with them, and my pareidolia-prone mind ran rampant as I spotted human eyes covering the bark. Really, it was just dark splotches on the trees’ skin. I wondered if Jess knew that too, or if she mistook the marks for giant eyes gazing at her. From the way she watched the treeline, teeth bared and tail pointed, I assumed the latter. We kept walking, eventually reaching the point where the path petered off into a downtrodden grass line. That was our cue to turn, and we did just as the sun reached its highest point in the sky. The way back always seemed to go quicker, and I felt much more relaxed. Especially now with lungs full of fresh air. I often got annoyed at my mother for telling me to just go outside whenever I was in a slump, but it honestly really did help. Jess, on the other hand, was still agitated. I decided it would do no harm to let her off the leash for a bit to go for a runaround.

I crouched and disconnected the small chain from her collar's hook. As soon as I did, she bolted into the woods. I laughed and stood, watching her run from one side of the path to the other. I kept walking, picking up sticks and throwing them for Jess as I went. She'd bring them back to me, covered in slobber, waiting expectantly for them to be hurled again. I never threw the same one twice, not wanting to dirty my hands. Unsurprisingly, there was an abundance of projectiles to choose from, and I left a trail of wet twigs behind me. Jess sometimes stopped to investigate random patches of ground, sniffing around until she was certain there was nothing interesting to glean. This was normal behaviour for her. What happened next was not. 

Near the halfway point, or maybe just past, Jess bolted off into the forest. She had many times before, but not to the point where she'd gone completely out of view, as she had done just now. When I noticed this, I stopped and looked around.

“Jess!” I called. 

I soon realised I couldn't hear her moving through the undergrowth, and called her name again. This time, if anyone had been around to hear me, they would've noticed I sounded more panicked. 

“Jess!” I shouted. 

Moments before I ran into the forest myself to look for her, I heard a heavy thumping. I looked around, and saw Jess scattering towards me. She didn't stop in time, and crashed into my legs. She tried desperately to hide behind my legs, before putting her paws over her eyes and collapsing now. Concerned, I crouched next to her and tried to soothe her, rubbing her back. As soon as I touched her, I realised she was shaking. I'd never seen her so afraid. 

“You poor thing,” I muttered repeatedly as she continued to tremble. 

Eventually, I goaded her from her open hiding spot and attached the leash to the collar once more. I stood to walk, but Jess refused to budge. I sighed and crouched down again, ready to pull her paws away from her snout. And then I heard it. 

*thump, thump, thump*

Twigs and dry earth crunched under heavy feet. I shot up and frantically looked around me. The faint noise grew sharper as I searched, but saw no hint of its source. It stopped for a moment when I looked near the thick birch that lay just a dozen yards in front of me, and then picked up again once I turned my attention to Jess. I tugged at the dog's collar, trying to get her to move. The clear sound of footsteps neared as she began to stir, and I dragged her behind me as I ran back down the path. My eyes stayed fixated on the treeline, but I saw nothing. The entire way back down, I felt like I was being watched. The sensation was overwhelming, and this time I couldn't explain it away with pareidolia. I held my breath until I reached the main road. I stumbled past two hikers ready to begin their ascent near the gate, who looked at me strangely. I eventually stopped and leaned against the nearest wall, panting. My heart beat out of my chest as I realised just how powerful my fight or flight response had been. Eventually, I calmed myself and walked the still panting Jess back home. 

By that evening, I had rationalised away the events of the day. It was almost certainly just another kid playing in the woods, as I myself had spent countless hours doing. Jess had been spooked, and I played off her emotion and got spooked, too. As the day went on, I pushed it further from my thoughts. Dinner was strangely tense, and I assumed Gary had forgotten some anniversary. After, I did the washing up with my mother and watched cartoons with Sue before she went to bed. Once my social obligations were fulfilled, I went back to my bedroom. Jess ate from her freshly filled bowl of slop while I laid on my bed, listening to the new 200 Stab Wounds album. I stayed there for a while until Jess curled up on her own flea-rag of a bed in the corner of the room. I decided to do the same, turning the lights off and pulling myself under the covers. I was asleep for maybe a few hours until I awoke with a bladder bursting at the seams. I quickly got out of bed, stumbled awkwardly down the hall and went into the bathroom. A few minutes of pure relief later, I yanked my underwear up, briefly washed my hands and made my way back to my room. I walked more carefully this time, trying not to wake the sleeping toddler whose room I just passed. I got back to my own and fumbled in the dark for the light, not wanting to accidentally stand on one of my half-finished art projects that I kept next to my bed. As soon as the light came on, I noticed something wrong. Jess was gone. 

I sighed. I left my door open during my adventure to the toilet, and must've woken her up with my movement. I made my way to my window, and pulled back the curtain. Sure enough, I sawJess's silhouette in the old doghouse. I could just about make out the form of her snout, shrouded in darkness. The kitchen door was fitted with a flap that Jess used to use to come in and out of the yard, yet another installation Gary promised to remove and never did. My bedroom sat directly above the living room and had the same view of the backyard, only elevated. Jess sat in the darkness of her old home, a fraction of moonlight revealing just a small part of her head. I squinted, and could just about make out that she was looking in the direction of the kitchen door. In the past I would've let her stay out, assuming she wanted a break from the musty room. But after everything I had heard, I knew I couldn't take any chances. 

I drew my curtains, and switched the light off as I exited my room once again. As quietly as I could, I crept down the stairs and onto the 1st floor. I walked the short hall into the kitchen and saw something strange. Jess. She was sitting on the kitchen's linoleum floor, just across from the dining table. The dog was staring right at the backdoor, and as I approached, I saw her teeth were bared. Had she come back in without me hearing? I walked around and crouched in front of her, blocking her view of the door. I looked at her dumb, but wary, face quizzically. I put a hand on either side of her head and started to scratch and stroke, calming her until her tail began to wag. She lost the snarl, and let her tongue hang out. I smiled as she returned to normal and stood, intent on leading her back to her bed. As I did, I heard a noise that made me spin around. The dog flap was rattling back and forth like a saloon door. Something had just been pushing it open. Immediately, Jess began to bark. I had to grab her collar to stop her from disappearing out of the dog door. I tried to silence her, but it was too late. A light came on upstairs and I braced myself for a lecture.

I didn't like Gary. There was always something slimy about him. My mother surely thought the same, but I knew she didn't want to go back to long nights alone. At this point, I wondered if she loved Sue more than Gary. Other than at the dinner table, I could easily avoid Gary for most of the day, especially when I was at school. Although he was functionally my step-father, I didn't view him as such, and certainly would never call him “dad”. He'd never really disciplined me as my real father had done, usually opting to ignore. That was until that night, when I woke up Sue while he had a hangover. He let my mother take care of his child while he barreled downstairs, finding me with Jess in the kitchen. He shouted at me, slurring his words, but managed to say something about me disturbing the peace. Then, he started to mock me, saying that he caught me in the act of sneaking out to see a girl. That really showed how much he knew me, I thought.

“Good guard dog,” He mumbled, rubbingJess's head roughly.

She whined and moped away from him, curling up in the kitchen corner. After the uncomfortable interaction, I took Jess back to my room, where she collapsed, exhausted, into her bed. I returned to mine, and tried to sleep as my mother and Gary argued in the hall. From what I could make out, it was over him dumping the responsibility of raising Sue on my mother. I got a strange nostalgia from going asleep to the sounds of adults arguing. This continued over breakfast the next morning, where I really thought they were going to separate at the table right then and there. Between bouts of shouting, my mother suggested I take Sue to the park. I agreed, happy to escape the house, and accompanied my mother as we packed stuff into the pushchair. I got Sue from her room and told her the plan, laughing at how excited she got. Despite the ground being bone dry, she decided this was the optimum time to try out her new red wellies. We went down stairs where I found Jess, who I assumed wanted a break from the arguing too. I got her leash and wrapped it around my wrist, walking the dog as I pushed Sue along. The sun was out, and so was an oddly judgemental running club. They shot overly dirty looks at me as we passed each other. Their reason for disgust was unknown to me, but cemented my disdain for being out in the public eye. 

The park wasn't too far from where I lived. Handily, the sidewalk there was complemented with rows of trees that cast a cooling shade. When I say “park”, I mean a barely maintained field of green that sat in the center of a more built up part of town. A square of trees surrounded it, which seemed to box in the park from the surrounding concrete. It felt like the town, which itself was surrounded by woodland, was trying to get its own back by encircling this small patch of what was once forest. We arrived without a hitch, and I stationed the pram by a bench and unbuckled Sue. I was always wary to let Jess play in this park, since it was hemmed in on all sides by a busy road, but figured the risk was mostly in my head. The park's elevation was lower than usual, and every way down to it from the sidewalk was a fairly steep incline. Or at least it was until they added the steps and wheelchair ramp. I later realised the difficulty, and cost, of making the ground even was the only way this patch of the great outdoors survived. 

I kept a more than keen eye on both Sue and Jess. There was a group of young mothers in the park with their children, and I suppose I was attempting to blend in. As I sat and prepared myself for an open-air babysitting shift, I couldn't help but over hear the hushed chatter of the group of young boys across from me. 

"It's a monster in the forest, I bet," Said one.

"What, like a giant dog magnet?" Said another. 

"I just hope Annie comes back soon," said the forlorn looking tween in the center of the group. 

I figured they were discussing their own immature theories and explanations for the recent dog disappearance, and silently sympathised for the one who's own pet had fallen victim. My attention soon turned back to my own pet, however. Sue loved Jess, and enjoyed throwing sticks for her. Thankfully, her furthest toss went just over a yard, and I knew there was no risk of Jess running in front of a car. I watched her attempt hand-stands and cartwheels, and fail at outrunning Jess. The time went by quickly and both Sue and Jess were clearly worn out before long. I gave Sue her banana snack bites to chow down on while I sorted out her pushchair. I packed up the water bottle, food wrappers and other toddler paraphernalia, then leashed Jess once more. I struggled to push the sleepy child up the incline, finding no offer of help from any of the passersby. With a little aid from Jess, I managed to get her up onto the sidewalk. From there we began the journey home, which seemed to grow shorter every time I walked it. Sue was telling me some likely untrue bird facts as we came over the brow of the hill, and saw a cop car parked in our driveway. 

My heart sank. I immediately assumed the worst, and pinned Gary as being responsible. Sue obviously didn't have the same thought process, and was confused by me approaching the house so tentatively. I let Jess off the leash, who ran up to the front door. I followed close behind but before I could manoeuvre the pushchair up the steps, the door opened. My mother appeared, talking to a tired looking cop. He told her to ring them if anything else happened, then sighed and made his way to his car. My mother's attention then turned to Sue and I, and we were led inside. 

The day before, Gary and his daughter were playing out in the garden. He gave her free reign of the hosepipe and told her to water the flowers. Sue wasn't exactly a keen gardener, and ended up drowning the plants instead of quenching their thirst. The portion of the backyard where the potted plants lay was thoroughly within the splash-zone, and had been rendered into mud. It was still malleable when, later that night, a pair of heavy boots had left their mark. Only three footprints could be found, relegated to the sodden patch of earth surrounded by otherwise hard dirt. As morning came, that small patch dried out, immortalising the footprints where they stood. Not too long after I left with Sue and Jess, my mother had stormed outside and spotted them. The fear that someone had been moving around the house at night, coupled with her already stressful day, had induced a panic attack in my poor mother. Something Gary didn't handle well. Instead of comforting her, he got annoyed with her, and was even more annoyed still when she called the police.

I contemplated telling my mother about what I had seen, but… what had I seen? Some movement in the woods? A dog flap being blown open? I decided it was best to keep my mouth shut, and not let my own worries add to my mother's. She clearly didn't need them. Dinner was somehow even more tense than breakfast had been, and ended with my mother bursting into tears. I went to her side to comfort her, while Gary grunted and got up. I watched as he went out the kitchen door and into the backyard. I heard him open the door to his shed  then saw him walk past the window. Sue kept eating her animal crackers, oblivious to the seriousness of the matter. My mother collected herself and I got her some tissues. After drying her eyes, she looked around and realised what Gary was doing. She quickly got off her chair and ran into the yard, with me following closely behind her. Gary had just finished patting down the footprints with a shovel, erasing any trace that they'd been there. He left the shovel propped up against the wall and walked past us and inside. 

“There's nothing to worry about,” He said coldly, and disappeared back into the house. 

Just before bed came the second harsh blow. I'd spent the evening in the living watching trash on the TV instead of in my room, not wanting to leave my mom alone. There was a muggy, oppressive atmosphere in that room. 
After some time had passed, I offered to bring the almost unconscious Sue to bed. As we went upstairs, I could hear the buzz of a new argument beginning. Sue put her pajamas on, and then I convinced her to brush her own teeth. After, she went into her blindingly pink room and jumped into bed, demanding I read her a story. I went rooting through a pile of picture books, trying to find the shortest. As I did, Sue started babbling about her week. This chatter turned into a pointed question when I sat on the edge of her bed. 

“You know the big doggie?” She asked, waiting patiently for my answer. 

“Jess?” I said in reply. 

She dramatically shook her head. 

“No, the big doggie.” 

“I don't know what you mean,” I said, choosing the truth over playing along with a fantasy. 

“Well I see him sometimes when I go tinkle at night,” she said plainly. 

I looked at her, confused. 

“And… what does he look like?” I eventually asked. 

She chewed on the question for a while before answering; “Like a big doggie.” After that, her scatter brain moved onto something else. Once she had finished regurgitating the plot of a cartoon she watched that morning, I flew through a picture book and told her “goodnight”. I got up and went to her bedroom's one large window, which had a view of the street and the surrounding houses. I closed the pink curtains and switched on her nightlight, then tripped on a toy as I tried to leave. Sue giggled as I closed the door, telling her “goodnight” for a second time. 

Downstairs, the arguing had just died down. I went back into the living room and sat next to my mother, the only occupant. She asked me how Sue was and I told her fine, and then she said something that ruined my day. She told me that Gary, in an effort to give some reassurance to my mother, was making Jess spend the night in the kitchen. Judging from last night, Gary had told her, she'd bark at anyone who'd come by. I tried to protest, but my mother agreed that it was a good idea. 

“You're too attached to that dog,” Gary said, walking back in, “it's not like she's a person.”

I looked at him in disbelief.

“She's not safe! She'll run off!” I pleaded. 

Gary dismissed me. 

“It's fine, kid, I put the trashcan in front of the door,” he assured me, “she's not getting out.”

After some more back and forth, my mother joined in on Gary's side. I tried to remind him that he's the reason she has to stay in my room all day anyway, but he didn't listen. Defeated, I trudged upstairs, making sure to take extra loud steps to show them I wasn't happy with the whole arrangement. As soon as I opened the door to my room, Jess sprung from her bed and came to my side, looking for scratches. I cuddled her, telling her the plan. She seemed indifferent. I grabbed her bed and her favourite chew toy, a plastic goose, and brought all three of them back down stairs to the kitchen. Gary had dragged the trashcan in front of the door, blocking the dog flap. He then appeared behind me, commanding me to leave the bed in the middle of the kitchen. Once I put it in what he deemed the right spot, I gave Jess her chew. 

“Be careful, girl,” I told her. 

She tilted her head in answer. With that, I stood, scratching her head and left. Gary closed the door behind me, shutting my best friend, my only friend, in for the night. 

I could not sleep. I tried, but there was no way I could stomach not knowing if Jess was ok until the morning. Tossing and turning, I finally swung my legs out of bed shortly after my red digital clock hit 3:00 AM. I stood and stretched, and walked to my window. Glancing out from between a crack in the curtains, I saw the yard was empty. I scratched my chin as I decided to creep downstairs and check on Jess. I knew I had to be quiet, so I took it agonisingly slowly. I gently pulled the handle down and pushed the door open, careful not to make a sound. I stepped out into the landing, not bothering to close it fully behind me in fear of the click. I tried to taper my own breathing, afraid of the noise my own body was producing. It took me a full minute to tip toe to the stairs, and another two to descend them in silence. Once I hit the first floor, I turned left and crept to the kitchen. I was more liberal with my movements now, sure that I couldn't be heard from Gary's bedroom. I opened the door to the kitchen, and saw something I couldn't quite believe.

It was too dark to make it out properly, but for a second, I thought there were two dogs in the kitchen. Jess, more visible with her white patches, and second dark figure. I fumbled around for the light switch, eventually finding it and illuminating the kitchen. To my relief, there wasn't a second dog. The figure I had mistakenly identified was just the silhouette of the plastic trashcan, which had fallen over. I breathed out, approaching Jess, but stopped. I was quickly introduced to a new horror. As soon as my brain thought to ask ‘what had knocked the trashcan over?’, it saw the answer. A gloved hand was protruding from the dog flap, offering out chunks of raw meat. Jess had been eating out of its palm, but quickly stopped to look at me. She began to turn when the hand violently reached further in and grabbed her collar. Jess yelped and jumped, and tried to struggle. It was no use. She has yanked back through the dog flap, a second hand ensuring her passage. Once her rump was gone, the small door swung back into place, as I had seen it do the night before. 

I was stunned. After witnessing the reverse birth, my body went into shock. I was frozen, listening to the sound of a struggle in my backyard. Jess was barking loudly, and was met with an imitation of her desperate calls by whatever had grabbed her. She soon went silent after a loud, painfully hard thump. It was in that moment that my fight or flight kicked in. The last time it had, my body chose flight and I ran like a baby out of the woods. This time, however, it chose fight. I roared and whatever was hurting my best friend and grabbed the door key from its little ceramic bowl. I unlocked it and ran into the night, just in time to see that hulking, hairy thing stuffing a limp Jess into a large, black garbage bag. It was panting and shuffled down between my house and the fence. It tried to look back at me, but seemed unable to turn its head. I shouted at it again, feeling my rage pouring out of me. I grabbed Gary's shovel and gave chase. 

That thing was covered head to toe in fur. A disgusting mottled mess that clung wetly to its corpulent frame. In one hand, it dragged the black bag containing my Jess. In the other, it carried an old claw hammer. By the time I reached the street, that beast had started running awkwardly, and was already heading over the brow of the hill. I screamed until my throat was sore and clutched the shovel tightly, more than ready to strike. By the time I got to the brow of the small hill, every light in my house was on, and a handful in the adjacent homes too. I left that behind me, guided by my newfound hatred of this thing. As I neared it, I heard clearly the vile sounds it made. Childlike giggles that could only have come from a fully grown man, and an obese one at that. They were interspaced with moist snorts and what could only be described as moans of pleasure. I stopped to swing at it, but missed the back of its head by a hair. I watched it carelessly drag the bag containing my best friend along the concrete sidewalk, and I realised I was crying. Thoughts of being alone powered me forward as we crossed the street. I knew, somewhere in the back of my mind, that this thing could easily kill me if it tried, as it had done to Jess. But I didn't care, or if I did, the adrenaline blocked me from feeling it. I was about to swing again when the garbage bag squirmed. 

The beast was knocked off balance byJess's thrashing. It stumbled and slowed, just as we were passing the park. I swung the shovel as it began to turn, the metal end making contact with the side of the beast's head. It fell, tumbling down the incline. Jess, still trapped in the plastic bag, when tumbling after it. Soon after, so did I. By the time I landed on the dry grass, the beast had already scrambled away and gotten to its feet. I stood, holding the shovel like a spear. Just then, the clouds above passed and the almost full moon was revealed in its true glory, illuminating the horrid scene. For a moment, I thought part of the beast fury hide had been cut open and torn away by the fall. But then I realised something.

 It was a suit. I could make out almost a dozen dog pelts, skinned from those poor animals and stitched together. The threaded seam had burst near the chest. The man's abdomen was covered by a single dark brown pelt from a large dog, cut into the shape of a love heart. Now, the top part of it hung down. The head of a mastiff was being used as a mask. The bottom part of the jaw was gone, giving way to crude stitching that connected it to the rest of the outfit. Small metal bars going through the skin kept the  canine shape and propped up the snout, although only a few of them were visible. Where the dog's eyes would've been, there were now only two large holes. Behind them were a human's eyes, a man's eyes. They were wide and raw and looking at me intensely. The only non-dog parts of the suit were the hands and feet. The hands were covered in a workman's gloves, and on his feet he wore a pair of heavy boots. Thin clouds moved in front of the frightened moon, plunging us back into half-darkness. Now, only its eyes caught the light. The metal head of its hammer was too stained with blood to reflect. 

Jess yelped, tearing her way out of the plastic bag. The man's attention switched from me to her, and I took my chance. When the shovel came crashing down on the man's forehead, the impact made the entire wooden handle shake. He crumpled, but I didn't stop there. I stood over him and struck his head again and again. His body started convulsing, but eventually stopped once the grass around his head was drowned in blood. I dropped the shovel, regaining my senses. My hands started to shake and I dropped to my knees, crawling backwards away from the beast. Jess nestled up to me, and I hugged her dearly. The fur on the top of her head was matted with blood, but she would be fine. She was just, like me, dazed and confused. 

Half way through staggering back home, my mother came running towards me. She hugged me in the street, and Jess joined in too. As she helped me back home, I tried to tell her everything. Most of it came out in disjointed descriptions, but the more she understood, the more she started to cry. We walked past awoken neighbours feigning concern and walked up the steps to our house. When we got inside, I went to go upstairs to the bathroom but she made me follow her to the living room. We sat down on the couch as she told me she had something important to admit. Just before she began, Gary walked in. 

“Leave us alone,” She said in a tone so iron-willed, I couldn't believe it came from my mother.

Gary obliged and left the room. My mother turned to me and took my hands in hers. 

“I'm so, so sorry,” she said through tears, “I should've told you all of this sooner. I just… I just didn't think you'd understand. You were too young and… and…”

She stopped to regain her composure. I was still crying. Jess had curled up at our feet, waiting patiently to be brought to the vet. 

“Your father was a sick man,” she said with clarity, “a sick, sick man. I didn't know, not fully, until after you were born. He thought he could tell me then, and that I wouldn't leave him. He was right. I tried to ignore it for years, I really did. I thought everyone has their own… their own… thing, but I couldn't take it anymore. Not when I found him with Jess. She was just a pup. I threw him out of the house, and divorced him soon after. I had to get a restraining order after he kept appearing back here at night, but eventually he disappeared. For years I thought I was free of him, until the dogs started going missing. The cops told me they'd look out for him, but never found any evidence. Oh Ben, I'm… I'm sorry.”

She pulled me into a hug and we spent the rest of the night crying into each other's arms while Gary took Jess to the vet. That was the night my life began to fall apart. It wasn't just because of what I'd learnt about my father, or the rift that it drove through my family. It was because when the cops searched the park in the early hours of the morning, they found no trace of a body.
