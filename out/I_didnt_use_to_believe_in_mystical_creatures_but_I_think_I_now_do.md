Hello I don't really use Reddit but this is my last hope. I don't really believe in mystical stuff but today made me believe. So like a week ago me and my friends are doing stuff like normal and he said that he woke up on the mountain that had some flowers that can "kill" werewolves. So everything started like 4 to 5 years ago and he wanted to become a werewolf and he was obsessed with mythical creatures. When he was 8-9 years old he did a ritual with a bucket with goat's blood and a satan's sign on the floor. Then he said the ritual, nothing happened.. Until now.   
  
Like a week ago he woke up on a hill near Wolfsbane flowers. He didn't think nothing about it and tought that he was just lunatic. Two days ago (from now) he was dreaming that he was running on four legs (like a dog or something), But to this day he still doesn't know if it was real or no, cause when he woke up his feets were covered in dirt. And yesterday when we were in our garden some kind of black man (white person but with black clothes) and he said to him in Lithuanian (our language) "i can help you" And they started fighting, and after that on his pelvis there were 3 deep scars, but today when we were at school they were almost not visible. Then when we were outside we walked past the flowers and he started coughing up blood and the scard disappeared. After some time we started walking to out go to spot (random old abondoned house or so we tought) and as we were walking he started these words: "Tichibi" "Himachi" "Machavi" "Sithaciu" "Jupaks jutaskiva" "Imidem" ( on some words it may be not "ch" but "c" and when we translated some of them and it said "killing" or some shit) and later he heard "durak" and then came with his lips red.   
  
When he went to the house for the first time we heard that he was being tossed around the house to the walls. After that he came with his front and back end all red and bloody lips once again. The second time he didn't go to the house but he went to the basement and saw some kind of creature with dark yellow eyes that were glowing. And we sprinted back to our garden. We were scared as fuck and when we were walking back home we saw siluates and heard volve's sounds everywhere. This all happened in a small city in Lithuania. Can anyone help us please? I will provide the pictures how the house looked (its not the same house for privacy reason) and how the flowers looked.  
  
  
P.S. we found some silver bullets in the house, and when the priest was at his house and were doing religiuos stuff he had a migrane.  
  
  
P.S.S Please for god's sake help me and my friend to find out how to help him. Any help is always appreciated  
  
  
P.S.S.S If there is any way to help him control himself, leave it in the comments
