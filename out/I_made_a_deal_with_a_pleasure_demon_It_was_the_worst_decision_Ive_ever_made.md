My pinky finger tasted like stroopwafel covered in maple syrup.

That was the first piece of me that they took—that I had given up. Without any fanfare, and without any need, if I’m completely honest. So stupid of me.

<<*Put the tip of your pinky finger in your mouth,*\>> they had said, without speaking. <<*Have a taste. It‘s the greatest feeling in the world…*\>> 

And they were right. The tip of my finger broke off, crisp and clean, like a delicate cookie wafer. I felt no pain—only a subtly sweet and sticky syrup combined with a satisfying crunchy texture. My pinky was the best snack I’ve ever had, and ever will.

Afterwards, the hint of maple just a whisper on the back of my tongue, I stared at my hand, at the tiny, missing space where earlier there was flesh and nail. Now, only a healed nub remained. I marvelled at the newborn pink of the skin, flawlessly and invisibly stitched back together. I savoured the taste of my finger and felt sadness and longing towards its fading memory. I really should have been more alarmed, but truthfully, I didn’t mourn the finger tip itself.

<<*Tell people you lost it chopping onions*\>> they winked, without winking. 

Their form defied description, and maybe comprehension. A vaguely human shape, with kaleidoscopic skin and features that danced in the corners of my vision and ran when my eye settled on them. Staring directly at them too long induced nausea, as if I had just swallowed a cup of sugar. But within the shifting landscape that they wore, I spied glimpses of both horror and ecstasy. I couldn’t help but shudder. I was repulsed. And yet I wanted more. 

When I think back to that first meeting now, I feel so dumb. It wasn’t like I was starving at the time. I wasn’t even hungry for a snack. I was simply *bored.* And the next thing I knew, there it was, in the corner of my living room, an ominous haze next to the TV I had been staring at.

A pleasure demon. <<*A connoisseur of all creation.*\>> At this line, I sensed it give an exaggerated, bowing flourish. A smirking grin lay behind its ever-shifting mass. 

<<*I’ve collected so many wonders of this world. Give me a taste of yours, and I’ll share mine. A fair trade, no?>>* They laughed—a sound like tinkling wind chimes overlaid on an infant’s scream. 

<<*Think on it.>>*

\*\*\*\*\*\*

The next thing they took from me was the colour purple. 

Which, again, really didn’t seem so bad. Purple’s not really that popular of a colour is it? Now whenever I stare at the eggplant emoji, I just see… nothing. Or rather, the colour “nothing.” Not grey, not black, but a pure emptiness, in the rough form of a suggestive vegetable. It’s like there’s a small, purple-shaped void in my mind. 

It had been yet another Friday evening that I was about to spend by myself on the couch. I had few friends and zero plans, but that was something familiar to me. The small studio apartment I called home felt like both a cage and a cave; something that kept me in, but also provided comfort and shelter and safety from the outside. It was when I was debating between Netflix or Youtube that the pleasure demon returned.

In return for the colour purple, they told me a story. But not just any story—the Greatest Story Ever Told. I remember a soft, golden hum, slowly filling my mind. I remember tones that sang sweeter than any music I’ve ever heard. I remember joy, terror, shock, and wonder. I remember gasping at the plot twists, crying at the deaths, cheering out loud at the triumphant climax, and crying, again, at the satisfying resolution. 

Afterwards, when I stared at my phone and realized that I had been listening to the story for seven hours, when I raced to my computer to write it down, I realized that I remembered none of the details. Nothing but a lingering memory of that experience, pleasant with a hint of the grotesque, something I grasped desperately for but remained just out of reach. 

<<*Don’t you worry,>>* the demon cooed. <<*I’ll be back.>>*

\*\*\*\*\*\*

Next, I lost the ability to dream. 

The pleasure demon had returned on another Friday, but this one capped a particularly rough week at work. One of those weeks where nothing went well, and everything felt harder than it should have. 

When I saw the pleasure demon out of the corner of my eye in the kitchen, I felt excitement and relief. As stupid as it sounds, I almost wanted to embrace the demon like a friend. 

<<*Tough week?*\>> they asked, with a very good approximation of sympathy. 

“Give me a good one,” I replied.

<<*Good One coming right up!>>*

The demon’s vague form had been a few feet away, on the other side of the kitchen. But the next thing I knew it stood in front of me, filling my vision with that unsettling, writhing mass. I felt a chill run through my spine and a brief moment of fear. But the demon reached out— touched— then *pushed past* my skin, and the chill was replaced by a slow rolling thunder that began in my toes, picking up heat and momentum as it travelled up my body, before erupting in bliss when it reached my throat. I opened my mouth, maybe to scream, maybe to gasp, but instead my mind shattered into a million pieces of pleasure. 

When I returned to my body, it was Saturday morning. But it took a few days before I discovered that I could no longer dream, days that I mostly spent trying desperately to cling to the fading memories of the euphoria I experienced that night. When I realized what had happened, what I had given up this time, I was struck by not only horror but also, for the first time, regret. I liked my dreams. I liked the ability to escape in my mind, to tell myself stories. This time, I did mourn my loss.

I decided that I needed to arm myself with knowledge. First I tried Googling “pleasure demon,” but I only found resources for painting miniatures or references to video games. And my demon is very real. Next I tried ChatGPT, which (of course) was even worse. Then the local public library, where “pleasure” and “demon” together gave me a real grab bag of options—but all fiction. 

Finally, I decided to search the dusty independent bookstore a few blocks over. Crossing its doorway was like stepping over a threshold into another world: From a busy urban street into a musky memory from centuries past. The space was small, like most downtown businesses, but books—most of which looked like they had seen better days—cluttered every visible surface. No other customer was inside, just the storekeeper quietly reading behind a giant, scarred mahogany table that served as the checkout counter. She didn’t look up when I entered. I picked an aisle under the “Non-Fiction” sign that was barely hanging on to the ceiling, and dove in. 

After an hour of fruitless searching, I returned to the woman at the checkout table. 

“Hi, excuse me,” I nervously asked, then cleared my throat. “Do you carry anything about, uhm, pleasure demons?”

She had looked up when I first spoke, but at the last part a different expression subtly took over. She searched my face, while I held her gaze, hoping that the creases she wore, the complete opposite of my youth, was evidence of wisdom and experience that she may gift onto me. After a moment that stretched just slightly too long, she slowly shook her head. 

“I can’t help you with pleasure demons.” She rolled the words out slowly, as if recalling something ancient from her past. “No one can. You must help yourself. I’m sorry.”

I was a little taken aback; this was a strange response to me asking about books, after all. But as I turned to leave, she suddenly reached out and imprisoned my hand in a tight, leathery grip. She showed surprising strength for a person of her age—I could feel her middle finger sharply squeezing the nub of my pinky—as if she’s decided to pour all the energy available to her into this moment. 

“The people who have— who have asked this question.” She stared directly at me with an intensity that was unnerving, her bird-like frame slightly trembling now behind the desk. “All their lives become worse. All of them. Without fail.

The only difference is how fast they fall.” 

She squinted at me for a second longer, then released me, and the intensity and energy faded as quick as it came. 

“Sorry I can’t help. Have a nice day.” 

I left the store with a stomach churning like a stormy sea. The encounter at the bookstore unsettled me, and I resolved to make no further trades with the demon.

That resolve lasted for three months.

It was the start of yet another weekend to myself, when the pleasure demon returned. I don’t really know why they showed up when they did. Things in my life were fine. Maybe this time, they were the one that was bored.

<<*I’ve been thinking of you. Dreaming of you, you might say.>>* They laughed, setting my eardrums aflame. I wanted to speak up, to tell the demon to leave, but I surprised myself by realizing that their appearance felt like a pleasant surprise. Joyful memories of what I’d experienced in the past, faded as they were, returned to the centre of my mind. And yet again, I found myself trading a part of myself away. 

Like before, a night passed without me realizing it. When I returned to my apartment, I found a chunk of my arm missing. Where there was once flesh, now there’s a crater in the shape of a near-perfect rectangle, two inches on the long side, right above the crook of my elbow. The indent was covered with thin pink skin that buzzed with a faint stinging sensation. I could see the paleness of bone just beneath the floor of the unnatural, boxy depression. I screamed.

After hyperventilating for a few minutes, then passing an empty prayer of thanks for my concrete walls, I turned my attention back to my arm, the disfiguration no less awful than moments before. It was like my arm was dough, and someone removed a piece with a cookie cutter. I felt vomit creeping up my throat. To this day, I stick to long sleeves.

I wish I could say that was the end of my exchanges with the demon. It should have been. But I made one final trade. 

In this last encounter, the experience of euphoria was tainted with the knowledge of my sin, and fear of what I’d lose next. The answer, as it turns out, was three weeks of my life. 

When I finally left that realm of bliss and returned to the world, I found myself lying in an unknown alleyway. I felt dampness under and around me, including on what I quickly realized was the dumpster I was leaning against. A morose, inky sky, with a faint orange glow on the edges, told me that it was night in the city. As my eyes adjusted to the dimness, I was hit with a heavy stench. 

Where I was, how I got here, and how to get home—I soon realized these were the least of my worries as, horrified, I examined my body. Within the tattered rips of my shirt, I could see still-healing scratches and bizarre, spherical punctures, like stabbings from a Bic pen. And covering it all, covering *me*, from head to toe, was a heavy, thorough cake of blood and shit. I was the stench. 

Thankfully I still had my phone, though I dropped and cracked it on the grimy alley ground when I saw the date.

The worst part wasn’t the shame I felt snaking my way through the city in that state until I finally reached my apartment (that I remained in the same city after all that time was another small mercy that I’m grateful for). 

The worst part also wasn’t the work of building the fractured fragments of my life back together. My job was gone; the few friends I had, barely hanging on. And I never did escape the suspicion and shady remarks from the landlord after being late on rent for two weeks. 

The absolute worst part are the shards of recollection that impact without warning and explode my soul, like a streaking hot comet from the dark recesses of my memory. I can be buying groceries, catching up with a friend over coffee, or lying in bed at night, when I'm struck down by a flash from what I know to be some moment within those three weeks. A twisted grin. A howl escaping my throat. A flash of blue fabric, that I had ripped off another moments before. A coldness, from metal on my bare thigh. When these moments strike, I’m paralyzed by disgust and self-loathing. A few times, I’ve let loose a cry of anguish. Once, I broke into tears. 

An unscarred mind. The chunk of my arm. And of course, the tip of my pinky. Those are some of the things I traded to the pleasure demon, and that I’ll never get back. For there is no way to beat them, no way of winning, and no escape. The demon remains an occasional presence in the corners of my vision. Even now, as I’m writing these words, I can see that amorphous, glittering, evil shape in the corner of my living room, offering their sweet and empty promises. I sense that my story even has its tacit consent. Perhaps they see it as publicity—a promotional pamphlet—but don’t be fooled. You know now: A deal with a pleasure demon is a deal you can’t break.

How long my current strength will last, I don’t know. What I do know is that, for the rest of my life, the pleasure demon will remain in the shadows of my eye, and in my moments of frailty, I can count on them whispering their words of false wonders against the barriers of my mind:

<<*Whenever you need me; I’ll always be here for you.*\>>
