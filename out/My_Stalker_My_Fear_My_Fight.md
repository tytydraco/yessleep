My name's Jess. I’m 32 and, at the time of this story, worked a boring office job and had always considered myself a “normal city-dweller.” But last year, everything changed, and my life hasn't been the same since. This is the story of the night I killed my stalker.

It was… Tuesday? Yeah, it was a rainy Tuesday evening, just like any other spring day in the Pacific Northwest. I was headed home after a long day at work, eager to relax with a hot cup of tea and continue binge-watching “Queer Eye” on Netflix. As I left the office, the rain was already soaking through my jacket, making me shiver. “Great day to forget my umbrella,” I thought to myself. Unsurprisingly, this wasn’t in the forecast for today. “Yeah, partly cloudy my ass,” I said in disgust.

As I walked down the street, I noticed him—a man standing across the road, partially obscured by the shadows of a flickering streetlamp. He was tall, with unkempt hair and a dark coat. He wore a medical mask, which made it hard to see his face, but what caught my attention was his phone, pointed directly at me. He appeared to be taking a video of me.

“What the fuck?” I muttered to myself.

At first, I brushed it off as being just another cracked-out homeless person. This is Seattle, after all. I quickened my pace, eager to get out of the rain and away from his unsettling gaze. Yet, as I walked, the feeling of being watched persisted, a cold knot forming in my stomach.

I glanced back. He was still there, unmoving, his phone still pointed in my direction. My heartbeat quickened. I told myself I was being paranoid, that it was just a coincidence. “Obviously he’s just a freak,” I muttered as I opened my car door.

I slid into my seat, slammed the door shut, and took a deep breath. When I looked back, he was still there, standing motionless in the rain, staring.

“Yeah, fucking weirdo,” I whispered to myself. The knot in my stomach tightened as I started the car. I made sure to flip him off as I drove through the gutter, splashing rainwater onto him. The satisfaction was brief, though. His unflinching stare lingered in my mind, making my skin crawl.

After merging onto the I5, I let out a sigh of relief, shaking off the strange encounter. Maybe I’d been reading too much r/nosleep. Yeah, that had to be it. The sooner I got home, the sooner I could forget about this and lose myself in “Queer Eye.”

The next day, I found a note on my car. It was a simple piece of paper, but the message sent chills down my spine: “You were really mean to me yesterday.” I looked around the parking lot, but there was no sign of the man from the previous night.

At work, my phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number: “I saw you leave for work today. Should have layered up, though. I hear it’s supposed to be another rainy day.” I threw my phone down on my desk in disgust. I felt exposed, vulnerable. Was this the guy from last night? How the fuck did he know where I lived? I showed the messages to my colleague, Linda, who insisted I call the police.

“You need to report this,” Linda said, her voice firm.

“I don’t know, Linda,” I replied, glancing at the message again. “What if it’s just a prank?”

“Better safe than sorry,” she insisted. “At least if something else happens you’ll have already made a report on him.”

Stephanie scoffed as she heard us talking about what to do. “Jess, I watched you splash that poor homeless guy with your car. You deserve whatever is coming to you.”

I always hated Stephanie. She’s the boss’s daughter and always found ways to subtly remind you of that fact.

On my lunch break, I called non-emergency. Dispatch told me a police officer would contact me to gather further information. The officer called me an hour or so later and took my statement but didn’t seem overly concerned. He advised me to be cautious and keep an eye out for anything suspicious but noted that “this is Seattle, after all. He just sounds like another lost cause.” I nodded, but his lack of urgency only heightened my anxiety.

Wednesday morning, I was extra careful as I left my apartment. I scanned the area, looking for any sign of the stalker but saw nothing. I thought maybe he had given up or, hopefully, got hit by a bus. But as I pulled into the parking lot at work, my stomach dropped. There he was again, standing in the lobby, talking with the security officer.

"Your employee splashed me with her car! If you don’t do anything about this then I will!” he shouted, his voice rising in anger.

I hurried into the elevator, my heart pounding. Thankfully, he had his back to me and didn’t see me come in. The doors closed, and I let out a shaky breath, trying to calm myself.

When I reached my floor, I quickly made my way to my office, avoiding eye contact with anyone. As I settled into my chair, I got a Teams notification from my friend Linda: "You okay? You look like you've seen a ghost."

I glanced at the lobby security feed on my computer screen. He was still there, arguing with the security officer, his masked face a disturbing reminder of last night's encounter. I texted back: "Just a weirdo I ran into last night. Hopefully, security will handle it."

But as I tried to focus on my work, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was far from over. My mind raced with thoughts of what he might do next and how I could protect myself. The sense of dread lingered, a dark cloud over my day.

That evening, as I drove home, I constantly checked my mirrors, half expecting to see him following me. I arrived home without incident, but the unease stayed with me.

I didn’t sleep that night. Every noise outside made me jump; every shadow seemed to move. By morning, I was a wreck. I decided to work from home, keeping the doors locked and curtains drawn. My phone buzzed again with another message: "You can’t hide forever."

My hands trembled as I read the message, the words blurring through my tears of fear and frustration. I texted Linda: "He's texting me now. I don't know what to do."

Linda replied almost immediately: "Call the police. Now. Do you want me to come over?"

I hesitated. I didn't want to drag her into this mess, but I was terrified. "Yes, please," I typed back, my fingers shaking.

Minutes felt like hours until Linda arrived. When she finally knocked on my door, I almost collapsed into her arms. She helped me call the police, who arrived and took a statement, but there was little they could do with just a text and no clear threats.

As the officers left, Linda and I tried to brainstorm what to do next. "Change your number? Stay somewhere else for a while?" she suggested.

I nodded, my mind racing. "Maybe I should get some security cameras, too. And an alarm system."

Linda stayed with me that night, but even with her there, sleep was elusive. The feeling of being watched, of being hunted, wouldn’t leave me.

The next morning, another text arrived: "Nice friend you have. It won't help."

Panic surged through me. How did he know Linda was here? I showed her the message, and her face paled. "This is getting too creepy," she said. "You should get out of here. Come stay with me for a few days.”

We packed a bag for me, and Linda insisted I stay with her for a while. As we left, I couldn't help but glance around, half expecting to see him lurking in the shadows. The dread was now a constant companion, whispering fears into my ear.

Linda’s place has a security system with cameras and an alarm. She let me download the app and log into the system so I could watch it for comfort. It felt a bit safer, but I knew it was only temporary. I was finally dozing off when my phone buzzed again: "Running won’t save you." I jumped as I hurriedly checked the security camera feed. He was standing in her driveway.

My breath caught in my throat. Linda looked at me with wide eyes and then we bolted out the front door to confront him. In that brief moment, he had already…disappeared.

As we sat down to call the police yet again, fear and frustration welled up inside me. Linda dialed the number while I scanned the cameras, hoping for any sign of him. The operator assured us that officers were on their way, but it felt like an eternity before they arrived.

The police did a thorough search of the property, but there was no trace of him. The officers took our statements and promised to increase patrols in the area. It was little consolation.

"Why is he doing this?" I whispered, more to myself than to Linda.

Linda shook her head, her expression a mix of anger and worry. "We need to figure out who he is and why he's targeting you. This can't go on."

In a moment of clarity, I decided to confront him. I couldn’t live in fear anymore. I called my friend, Mark. Mark’s a big guy with a protective streak and has been my knight in shining armor in the past with creepy ex boyfriends and that one time a rat got into my garage. When he arrived, we hatched a plan. I’d lure the stalker out, and Mark would handle the rest.

“I don’t like this, Jess, he seems like a loose cannon.” Mark said, his brow furrowed. “But I’ll be right there. Just be careful.”

That evening, I drove around the block, my heart in my throat, and there he was—standing at the end of my street. I stopped and waited. He approached, his expression a mix of rage and satisfaction. As he got closer, Mark emerged from the shadows, brandishing a baseball bat.

“Leave her alone!” Mark growled.

The man hesitated, then lunged at Mark with a fury I had never seen. The two men grappled, but before it could escalate further, the stalker backed up and pulled a fucking machete out of his pants. I screamed and yanked Mark back and we quickly got into my car, causing the stalker to flee into the night. Mark, visibly shaken at this point, exclaimed “who the fuck is this guy? Why is he targeting you?” I explained to Mark what I did to the guy earlier in the week but thought he was harmless, “this is Seattle after all,” repeating what the first police officer left me with over the phone.

“No. Clearly this guy is crazy and dangerous. We need to get you somewhere safe and call the police,” Mark said.

“Mark. I’ve called the police so many times. Seattle Police are just fucking useless these days ever since the ‘Defund the Police’ movement.” I quipped back.

Mark sighed in agreement. Okay, but you’re coming to my place so I can keep you safe until this guy either gives up or the police finally do something.

At Mark’s place, I called the police again, and they arrived quickly. The officers took my statement more seriously this time, promising to make finding this guy a priority. The sergeant gave me his business card and said, “if he comes back, I want you to call me, and I’ll personally respond. I don’t care what time you call, call me and I’ll put a stop to this for you.

“Jess, you need to stay strong,” Mark said, trying to comfort me. “You did everything you could.”

“I feel so responsible,” I whispered, tears streaming down my face. “I…” That was all I could get out before uncontrollably sobbing.

That night, my phone buzzed again with a message: “See you soon.”

Exhausted and scared, I finally fell asleep at Mark’s house. But in the middle of the night, I awoke to a terrifying sight—the stalker was on top of me, his hands around my throat. I struggled to scream, to fight back, but his grip tightened.

“Thought you could get away?” he hissed, his breath hot and foul against my face. All I could think about was the fact that I’m about to die literally feet away from Mark while he’s asleep in another room. “This bat-shit-crazy perfect specimen of Seattle’s Finest crackheads is going to fucking kill me,” raced through my head.

However, I wasn’t going down without a fight. Desperation surged through me. I clawed at his hands, my vision blurring. My fingers found a nearby lamp, and with all the strength I could muster, I smashed it against his head. He grunted in pain, loosening his grip just enough for me to scramble out from under him.

I dashed to the kitchen, my heart pounding, and grabbed the largest knife I could find. He staggered after me, blood dripping from his temple, a crazed look in his eyes. As the man lunged at me, I saw Mark stumble out of his room. “What the fu--” was all Mark could say before I acted on pure instinct and drove the knife into the guy’s chest. He fell to the floor, and I got on top of him.

He gasped, eyes wide with shock, and collapsed to the floor. I stood there, shaking, as the reality of what I had done sank in. The room was eerily silent except for my ragged breathing.

Then something in me snapped. As if through blind rage and tears, I sat on top of him and began stabbing him over and over while screaming. Mark finally pulled me off him. “Jess! That’s enough! He’s dead!” Mark exclaimed. Call the sergeant and tell him what happened.

Minutes later, our street was flooded with police lights. They found me sitting on the kitchen floor, the knife still in my hand, staring blankly at the lifeless body of the man who had tormented me.

“Hold on, guys,” the sergeant began, “she’s our victim. Let me talk to her.”

“Jess, are you okay?” the sergeant asked, kneeling down and gently taking the knife from my hand.

“I... I had to do it,” I stammered. “He was going to kill me. He was going to kill me, and I had to make sure that he died instead of me.”

“Holy fuck, Jess.” The sergeant said, “you really did a number on him, that’s for sure.”

The next few hours were a blur of questions, statements, and reassurances. They confirmed that my stalker, James Boone, was dead on the scene and that I had acted in self-defense. Despite this, the trauma of the event left me feeling hollow and shaken.

Even though James was dead, I couldn’t escape the shadows of those days. I moved to a new apartment, changed my routines, and tried to start over. But every time I saw a man standing alone or received an unknown message, my heart skipped a beat. The memory of that night haunted me, a constant reminder of how quickly a stranger’s obsession had spiraled into a nightmare.

James may be gone, but his reign of torment is forever etched in my mind. I lived in fear of his words, knowing that even in death, his shadow would always be behind me, a reminder of the darkness lurking in the hearts of strangers.

After the case was closed, I quit my job and sold my house. I moved to Nebraska, hoping to leave the nightmare behind and start fresh. The small town I chose was a stark contrast to Seattle, with its wide-open spaces and quiet, friendly streets.

I found a cozy little house on the outskirts of town, surrounded by fields and far from the hustle and bustle of city life. It was peaceful, almost too peaceful at first, but I needed the calm to heal.

Days turned into weeks, and slowly, I began to reclaim my life. I got a new job at a local library, where the routine and the tranquility of the place were a balm to my frazzled nerves. Linda visited often, her support a constant reminder that I wasn't alone.

But every now and then, a sudden noise or a fleeting shadow would send my heart racing, the memories of that horrific night lurking just beneath the surface. I attended therapy sessions regularly, working through the trauma, trying to piece myself back together.

One evening, as the sun set over the golden fields, I sat on my porch with a cup of tea, the familiar warmth grounding me. My phone buzzed with a message from Linda: "How's my favorite Nebraskan doing?"

I smiled and texted back: "Better. Slowly but surely."

As I looked out at the serene landscape, I realized that while the scars of my past would always be with me, they didn't have to define my future. Nebraska was my fresh start, a place to build new memories and find peace. And for the first time in a long time, I felt a glimmer of hope.
