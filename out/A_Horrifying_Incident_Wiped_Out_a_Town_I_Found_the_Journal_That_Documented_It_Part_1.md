In the summer of 2001, I was a high school graduate starving for experience no classroom could provide me. My hubris took me across the Atlantic, where I taught English to the locals and lived in a world different from my home. For two years, I settled in a small village originally constructed for American GIs. I resided in a large home with three other fellow ex-pat teachers. I was having a ball and considered settling permanently in the country that welcomed me. That is until I found a journal left behind by who I presumed was the house’s previous resident. The journal documented an ordeal so horrific that I broke my contract early and fled the country. Although unsure of what my goal is, I feel compelled to share the journal that haunts me. Perhaps I am just helping its author be heard. Or maybe I am hoping someone will break the story wide open and bring about some justice for those who perished. I fear for my safety by sharing this story. The fact that I never found a mention of the events anywhere in the media tells me there was a cover-up. This reinforces my fear, and as such, I will not reveal the country in question and have removed it from my transcription. I don’t want to be tracked. Other than that, the following is a full transcription of the journal. 

It was a Friday morning. I remember because I picked up the Thursday edition of the New York Times off my lawn. It was the only day of the week we got any printed media from home. Importing a major newspaper—even if one day removed—was a big deal with a big cost for our tiny town. Our budget was stretched thin to make it happen. One paper per week, that’s it. Someone decided Thursday editions were the latest possible we could get that would recap the weeks’ goings on, if that. Nobody worked Saturdays to receive the Friday editions, so we got Thursday papers. 

I also remember the day because of my Friday morning routine. Rather than re-entering through my front door, I rounded the side of the house and headed towards the back. I always hurried on the path between my house and the next becauseof who was waiting for me. 

She was already there by a neighboring second-story window. Standing surreptitiously behind the veil of curtains, she boldly pushed them away as I arrived from below. Her white negligee left little to the imagination under the morning spotlight. I never imagined myself living on foreign soil, but boy, was I glad to have landed in a place so blessed with sunshine. It was early, but makeup had touched her face. It was subtle, nothing overdone. And it was all for me. She put her palms on the sill and leaned her lithe figure out the window, letting it all hang. She tucked strands of shiny hair behind her ear and wiggled a few fingers at me. My god, was she beautiful. With a primal look in her eyes and a bite of her lower lip, she had me as she did every Friday morning. We stood there for a few moments talking in our silence—me praising her in all her morning glory. She turned her head to the call of someone in another room. “Ada,” the voice said. Then she was gone.

By the time I reached my backyard, someone else was waiting for me. Beyond the stretch of my swimming pool and the alleyway running the length of the block was Willy. That was not his real name. I had never gotten so far to learn his name. He always looked like a Willy to me, and so Willy he became. He was in his usual wife-beater tank top and denim shorts, looking like a perpetually pissed-off statue. His dark skin glistened in the sunlight. Standing hunched over in the adjacent backyard, his scowl seemed more pronounced with each sight of me. I pictured him coming out of the womb—probably seventy years ago—with a wretched frown for a birthmark. And due to a lifetime of malnourishment of parental love, he was left with his miserable mug. Unfortunately for me, Willy’s morning pleasantries had also become a part of my Fridays. 

I lifted the paper in my hand, gesturing *hello.* Nothing ever came back. He retracted his glare and limped back into his house. His right leg dragged along like a heavy sack with each step. 

“One of these days, I’ll get it out of ya,” I said to myself.

I gripped my back door’s handle and performed the secret handshake—a solid tug, a few jiggles, a sharp push, and the door popped out of its jamb. Standing on the other side—in the kitchen—was my wife, Julia. She looked as though I had just pulled off the world’s worst magic trick. 

The house was already baking under the sun, but she still hid under her plush red robe. A steaming mug clutched in her hand. I felt sweaty just by looking at her. Her hair was worn high in a bun with unkempt strays poking out. One broad stroke of white beauty cream ran above her brows, with another running perpendicular down her nose. More was smeared under her eyes.

“Three months,” she said, looking at her brother Dwayne. “Door’s been broken three months, and he still can’t bother to fix it.” 

Dwayne was visiting from back home. The one family member I wished never made the trip. The soles of his bare feet rested on my table while he sipped his tea. I dropped the paper on the table, and he picked it up. He sneered when he saw the date.

“Who’s gonna break in?” I said. “We know everybody. Well, almost.” The image of Willy’s glare popped into my head.

“So…” Dwayne said. He folded down a corner of the paper and looked at me. “If you’re not fixin’ doors needing fixin’, how are you spending your days?” It was a jab rather than a sincere question.

“I’m an accountant,” I responded. “Not a handyman.”

Dwayne said, “*Were* an accountant. Big sis tells me you’re not working anymore after Uncle Sam came knockin’.” He returned to the paper and said, “And you never answered my question.”

“Give it a rest, Dwayne,” Julia said. She gave me a peck on the lips and placed a consoling hand on my chest. “He doesn’t have to work. They flew us out here, provided this big house. Cost of living is next to nothing. And I make more than enough for the both of us.” With her other hand, she brought the cup to her lips. “Honey, you have got to try this tea Dwayne brought from back home.”

I shook my head. I was never a caffeine drinker, and ever since we arrived thirteen months ago, I could not stomach any beverage made from the local water. There was something in the taste that was off-putting. It was literally not my cup of tea.

“All that’s great,” Dwayne said. “But what’s there to do around here? Two days in, and I’m already bored out of my freakin’ mind.”

Julia said, “We got a modest little theater running classic movies. They got a pool table there, too. The locals love their pool. But we like to keep each other company. Don’t we, honey?”

Ada flashed behind my eyes, and I forgot to answer.

“How’s the sewage plant?” Dwayne said. He took a big gulp from his cup.

“Huh?” Julia responded.

“Where you work. The sewage plant.”

“Umm… no,” Julia said. Her eyes widened in exaggerated surprise. “It’s a water treatment plant. The government brought me and other scientists from around the world to clean the water of contaminants for the surrounding villages. These people need clean water for irrigation and to drink. Infections have been rampant in the villages in recent years.”

“And everyone in this community works for the plant?” Dwayne asked.

“Either works there or a family member of someone who does,” Julia said.

“And *you* get a big house to do whatever you want in while my sister brings home the bacon,” Dwayne said, flashing me a smug smile.

Julia responded with a frown. I wanted to reach across and slap Dwayne across the face. Knock his feet off my table while at it. Instead, I sat down and made myself a bowl of cereal.

“Ugh, I just can’t get enough of this tea,” Julia said. “It is home in a cup. I need a refill.” She walked towards the kettle on the opposite end of the kitchen. “Can I get you another, Dwayne?”

Dwayne shook his head, eyes not leaving the paper.

With her back to us, Julia poured into her cup. In between the crunch of my cereal, I heard the splashing on the floor. I looked up to see the scalding hot tea pooling around her feet. Steam rose from the floor, but Julia didn’t attempt to move. Then, the entire pot smashed to bits on the floor.

“Jesus Christ!” Dwayne yelled. He almost fell out of his chair.

I hopped to my feet as Julia started in a violent convulsion. “Julia?” I said.

Her head snapped in every which way, matching the impetuous spasms of all her joints. She shook furiously like a feeble plaything of a merciless demonic entity. The next thing I knew, I was behind her. I may have said something, but I don’t remember. I gripped her shoulders, trying to still her shaking, but it was like trying to stop a mechanical bull. She spun around suddenly and showed me all the horrors in her face. All color had drained from her eyes, leaving behind a set of soulless white clouds. Then they filled with a redness as if she was weeping blood. Her mouth was agape, and I could see the infinite redness within. A thick blob of foam spilled from the corner of her mouth and slid down her neck.

I froze in shock and fear at the surreal sight in front of me. Whoever this person or thing was, it no longer looked like my wife. I bellowed her name. The volume surprised me as I had no control over it. 

Suddenly, her shaking stopped. She dropped her head before it snapped back up and unleashed a blood-curdling shriek. My legs betrayed me, pulling me hard onto the floor. On my back, I used my hands to push myself away from her. Her feet jerked her forward, closing the distance between us. She crouched and leapt at me. 

The next few seconds came to a sluggish crawl. Arms outward, I braced myself for an attack. I watched Julia dive towards me, but she did not reach me. Flying over my head, Dwayne intercepted her. The force of his body crashing into hers took them flying several feet from me. I watched in utter disbelief as Dwayne straddled Julia. From my vantage point, I could not see what he was doing to her. I tried to yell, but nothing came out. Regaining an ounce of control, I pushed myself to my feet and saw it. Dwayne was savagely biting into Julia. Spurts of blood gushed high into the ceiling like a geyser. I could not discern her red robe from her flesh. Her limbs went limp and splayed on the floor.

I opened my mouth but only mustered a muffled cry. Dwayne snapped his head back towards me. His red, dead eyes bulged from his crimson face. Blood flowed from his forehead down into his mouth before overflowing and spilling back out. 

Julia’s nervous system still fired as her hands and feet twitched.

Demonic Dwayne leapt to his feet and lunged at me. Powered purely by instinct, my body powered back up. I darted out of the kitchen to my right and sprinted down the short hallway. Dwayne’s grunts let me know he was right on my tail. At the end of the hallway was the front door. In a split second, I decided against exiting through it. I would have to stop my momentum to turn the handle and pull the door open. Dwayne would rip me apart even before the door unlatched.

I locked onto the stairway across from the front door. *Run upstairs*, I thought to myself. I grabbed the banister at the landing and catapulted myself into a one-eighty, propelling up the stairs. At the top was the half-opened door of the washroom. I crashed through the door and felt the weight of Dwayne smashing into me from behind. The force launched us towards the bathtub. I spun and grabbed the shower curtain to prevent my fall, but the momentum was too great. Every plastic ring holding the curtain to the tension rod snapped simultaneously. My back hit the bathtub hard with Dwayne on top of me. In a twist of dumb luck, the stiff translucent curtain lay completely between us. 

I gripped two handfuls of the curtain and extended my arms, stretching the plastic taut. Like a feral beast unaware of such human creations, Dwayne tried to bite me as if nothing was between us. His head smashed into my face over and over. A piercing shriek followed each strike. I moved my head from left to right within the confines of the bathtub, but it was nearly pointless. Pain shot through the front and back of my skull as if someone had driven a spike through it. Julia’s blood dripped from Dwayne’s hair, face, and mouth. All I could see was thick red ooze smeared across the curtain.

Spots of black began to shroud my vision. I knew I had to do something quickly, or I would black out from the blows. I tried to kick him off, but the bastard was unusually strong for someone twenty-five pounds less than me. In another attempt to eat my face, his head slammed hard into the curtain, causing me to lose my grip. His head—wrapped in the curtain—fell onto my chest. Instinctively, I reached both arms around his head and locked them. Both hands clasped tight at the opposite elbows. I wrapped my legs around his torso, completing the terrible embrace. I pulled his face towards me and squeezed hard with every fiber in my body. I could feel his teeth sinking through the curtain, embedding into my chest. I screamed. He raised his head back—taking me with him—and brought it down again, slamming me into the tub. A smattering of stars passed through my vision. But I did not relinquish my hold. Letting go meant certain death. I squeezed even harder, cutting off his oxygen. Dwayne's savage screams weakened and began to fade. His strength slowly drained from his body. It did not matter to me as I continued to smother him. I held my grip for what felt like an eternity, even after his body went limp. 

Finally, I pushed Dwayne off me. His body made a loud thud as it slumped to the tile. I reached up and pulled myself out. Fearing he would roar back to life, I quickly stepped over his body under the bloody curtain and slammed the door on my way out. 

I made a beeline to my bedroom and tore through my nightstand drawer for my phone. My shaky fingers searched for my son in my contacts. Had it not been for the pebbled leather holder of the Nokia, I would have dropped it. My blood-streaked fingers struggled to press the rubber buttons as they slid off with any pressure.

A woman’s horrified scream off in the distance snapped me out of my confined terror. I walked to my opened bedroom window overlooking my front yard and adjacent houses. Its frame broadcasted the hellish chaos unfolding all around me. 

Beyond the row of residential houses, multiple plumes of black smoke tainted the blue sky. A loud, distant explosion spawned another black cloud. The back of a station wagon protruded from a house across the street. It had torpedoed through the front door, caving in a section of the structure. Somewhere, a child cried desperately for their mom. The terrible sound of shattering glass and colliding steel added to the din. A cacophony of fire alarms blared in unison. Down the street, a tall light post lay atop a crushed car. Two people dashed across my yard. I could not tell if they were running together or if one was chasing the other. From another house across the street, someone smashed through a second-story window and landed with a sickening splat. From how they landed, I knew there was no getting up.

The phone beeped and reigned me back. I gripped it tight and selected my son’s number. It rang for what seemed like an eternity before he picked up. “Callum,” I said before he could say anything.

“Why are you calling me?” he replied. “Where’s mom?”

“Where are you? Are you OK!”

“At dinner with my friends. What do you wan—”

The line went dead. “Hello! Hello!” I screamed into the phone before dropping it. The brick-like body sounded like a hammer hitting the floor. I picked up the landline and knew it was dead before I put it up to my ear.

The loud voice of a man drew my attention back to my window. A man I’ve seen before—a colleague of my wife’s—donning a white lab coat retreated backwards down the street. His arms were outstretched with his palms opened. A woman in hysterics was about eight feet away and walked towards him. The man—Mason, I think—continued to backtrack. He said, “Honey, please stay away!” He was frantic with fear. “You have to stay away!”

The woman appeared too hysterical to comprehend what Mason was saying. “Where are you going?” she said through sobs. She moved closer to him. “We have to get back. The girls… I think they’re dead.”

“I know,” Mason said through his sobs. “But it’s too late. The water… they drank it. You drank it. We can’t be near each other. I’m sorry, but please don’t come near me!” He was practically begging.

An explosion startled them both and took them to the ground. The woman lurched forward, falling near Mason’s feet. He tried to get up, but his back foot stepped on the tail of his lab coat, and he fell again. And just like I had witnessed happen to Julia and Dwayne minutes ago, the woman convulsed uncontrollably. She rolled to her side as foam dripped from her mouth. Like me, Mason was gripped in terror. It looked like he was moving in slow motion as he tried to pick himself up. 

*“*Run!” I shouted. He didn’t hear me.

The woman leapt to her feet. Her head snapped skyward as if a new soul had entered her body, re-animating it. Mason finally got up and ran, but it was already way too late. The woman pounced on his back, straddling him on the pavement. He screamed in agony as the bites shredded the back of his neck. Crimson seeped quickly into his lab coat. When Mason’s body went limp, the woman hopped to her feet and ran off furiously down the street.

The scene before me presented a grim realization—people just being near one another caused at least one party to become bloodthirsty and deranged. This is why Mason wanted the woman—presumably his wife—to stay away. She turned when she got close enough to him. Is this what happened to Julia and Dwayne when we were all in the kitchen together? It didn’t make any sense to me, but I didn’t have the time to ponder what did and didn’t make sense.

Movement on the lower left corner of the window frame caught my eye. Someone had started down the path between my house and the next—the same path I walked moments earlier. I heard a series of panicked breaths. Whomever it was, I could no longer see from my vantage point. I darted from my bedroom to another room with a view of the path. I pushed open the window and looked down. Ada—still in her negligee now dotted with spots of red—walked towards my backyard. She was heaving. Her shoulders bobbed up and down with each breath. In a sudden moment of clarity, a dire thought crossed my mind—Ada knows how to open my broken back door! My hypothesis on why someone turned may be wrong, but I couldn’t afford to test it. I couldn’t allow her to enter my house.

I shot out of the room and sprinted down the stairs. I moved so fast that my feet failed to keep up. My hand skidded off the banister as I flew over several steps. I stuck out my right foot to stop myself, but it caught an edge. The full weight of my momentum came crashing down on my foot, twisting it. My arms flung uncontrollably as I cartwheeled down the rest of the stairs. 

Then I felt it. Searing pain exploded in my right ankle. Laying on my side, I looked at my foot. The sole was no longer pointing downward. It was now angled towards my left foot, completely perpendicular to the connecting bones. The adrenaline then put me on autopilot. I pushed myself vertically and balanced on my left foot. Then, I ran. I gave in to the excruciating agony and ran on my mangled ankle. I felt the throbbing crunch of bone scraping bone, tendon, and muscle with each hobbled step, but I kept going as fast as I could.

By the time I reached the kitchen, the back door handle was rattling. The door cracked open, and I lunged at it. My face smacked against the glass, making up the top half of the door. My weight pushed the door shut. I pressed both palms against it, anchoring myself on my knees. On the other side of the glass, I saw a petrified Ada. I had never seen her like that before. Our encounters were always of the opposite emotion. She gave the door a futile push. We locked eyes, and I could tell she had not the slightest clue why I shut her out. 

Her red-speckled face broke into a forced half-smile. She said, “Baby, can you let me in?” Her wavering voice feigned seduction. “Gerry,” she continued. “He’s… he’s gone. We can finally be together. You and me.” She spun around and hiked up her negligee. “You can have me however you like.” She turned back to face me. The forced smile was still on her face. Her entire body trembled, fighting to keep the fear at bay.

I felt nothing for her. I thought I should be feeling something, but I was numb. My head just shook slowly. In an instant, her quiet demeanor vanished. The smile wiped from her face. Fear soon mixed with anger. She banged her fists against the door and shouted, “Open the goddamn door, you bastard! You let me in! Lemme in!” 

I spun around and sat on the floor, my back flat against the door. My head bounced with each fist hitting the door. Each one of her blows felt stronger than the one before. “Lemme in!” she continued to scream. Her voice started to break away. The pounding stopped. It was quiet for mere seconds. Then she spoke again. She sounded weak before an injection of fury like someone had turned the volume of a TV from low to max. Her usual sultry pitch descended into a demonic bass. It was no longer a voice I recognized. “Lemme in. Lemme… Leh… meh… in. Meh. In. Leh… Meh. In. Leh meh IN! LEH MEH IN! LEH MEH IN!” 

I braced for more heavy pounding as I heard the glass fracture. I started to slide forward with each heavy blow. The door started to creep open. There was no stopping it. I was a one-legged man in a contest of strength. And she possessed a supernatural strength like Dwayne did. I turned my head and saw her fingers wrapped around the edge of the door. The thought of those same fingers shredding me to pieces ran through my mind. I wished for the shock to overcome the impending pain and the light to go out quickly.

In the next moment, everything stopped. The pounding and pushing relented, and the door again slammed shut from my weight. The back of my head bounced hard off the wood. I turned and peered out the glass, now adorned with a spider web crack. Ada was in a full sprint down the alleyway, chasing a young woman screaming at the top of her lungs.

I don’t know how long I sat against the door. But the next time I looked through the glass, the sun was no longer perched in the sky. There was the occasional sound of a car engine whipping by. All cries of children had ceased. Someone would call out intermittently, but that, too, soon faded. There were no more explosions and alarms, no more cars decimating each other, no more echoes of chaos. Most conspicuous was the absence of any ambulance or police sirens. Our little community tucked away in a corner of the world had destroyed itself in a day.  

The sound of something in my backyard woke me from my stupor. It sounded like an object had fallen into my swimming pool. My view of the pool was obscured by our outdoor dining set and pool chairs. And I was not about to venture out to investigate. 

The unbearable pain emanating from my busted ankle reminded me of my unfortunate affliction. My ankle was now the size of a grapefruit and deep red. I took stock of the medication in the house that would help me but came up dry. Due to a series of recent migraines, Julia had nagged me this past week for a bottle of painkillers from the local grocery store. Ada had made me forget all about that. 

In the darkness of my kitchen, I stared hard at my ballooning ankle and knew I had to set it. Realigning it would at least relieve some pressure and allow me to tape it. Although injured, a straight ankle was better than a twisted one. 

I inched away from the door and reached for the nearest dining chair. I tugged on its leg lightly to mitigate any noise as it slid towards me. Attracting one of those things was the last thing I wanted. With a little force, the top of the chair wedged tightly under the door handle. There was not a chance in hell the chair would stop anything from busting through, so I had to replace it. 

I army crawled to the refrigerator and pulled myself up with the handle. It was completely dim inside when I opened the door. That’s when I realized my situation just got worse. The electricity was gone. 

I hadn’t realized how thirsty I was until I saw the bottles of water lining the dead fridge. I twisted the cap off a bottle and drank it so fast I practically inhaled it. The next five minutes or so were spent shimmying the fridge out of its tight spot. At least another five were spent walking the fridge over to my back door, one corner at a time. Neither task was easy on one foot. I removed the chair and pushed the back of the fridge firmly against the door. If one of those things could topple over the heavy fridge to get in, it would at least provide me enough time to get away. I took the mug Dwayne was using earlier and placed it on top of the fridge. Almost half of the mug’s bottom sat over the edge. Any forcible movement of the fridge and I would be signaled by the sound of shattering porcelain.

My attention turned back to my ankle. Carefully, I hopped across the darkness to the kitchen counter. I opened a drawer and pulled out a large wooden spoon. Lowering myself back to the floor, I placed the wooden spoon between my jaws. I brought my injured ankle closer and assessed it. I could not discern if it was dislocated or broken. It just had to be set right. My left hand gripped the heel, and my right grasped all the toes. In one swift motion, both hands wrenched the foot away from me, setting it back into alignment. Flashes of bright lights exploded before my eyes like a showcase of fireworks. My teeth clamped so hard across the wooden spoon that I heard the grains splintering. I wanted to scream but couldn’t. The fear and blinding pain muted me.

Beads of sweat traced along the side of my face, tickling me awake. My lazy eyelids retracted slowly to the sight of Julia’s corpse a few feet from me. She was frozen in an expression of shock and terror and aggression—bloodshot eyes wide open, mouth twisted in a snarl. Trace amounts of night cream still smeared across her face. Her limbs were outstretched, fingers curled like an animal about to spring upon its prey. Underneath her robe was a pool of black blood.

I stared at her corpse and felt nothing. Not one emotion was conjured from the sight of my wife of twelve years lying dead in my kitchen. What the hell was wrong with me? This was the woman who loved me unconditionally since the early days of our meeting. Who, at my lowest point, propped me up again to even greater heights. The woman who supported me financially for the past two years after I fell out of favor with my profession. She was lying dead right in front of me, and I could not muster one mournful tear for her. Was I in so much physical pain that my mind forgot how to feel again? Did the horrors of the day push me so far into survival overdrive that I could only consider my physical well-being?

My head dropped again. By the time I lifted it back up, the sun was rising. Light bled back into the kitchen. My swollen ankle and Julia’s corpse reminded me yesterday was not just a bad dream. My mouth felt like a desert, and I was weak. I knew my body needed food and water despite my having no appetite. It took every working fiber in my body to stand on my good foot. I downed a bottle of water from the refrigerator after forcing down a bowl of cereal. 

As if my senses were suddenly roused by sustenance, I started to detect a rancid odor from Julia’s corpse. A new day did not bring upon new emotions. Her corpse was just an object I had to move. I took a roll of duct tape and made my way upstairs. Opening the bathroom door, I was greeted by the same putrid smell. This time, coming from Dwayne’s corpse. Hopping gingerly to it, I dropped to my knees. I rolled it in the shower curtain and secured it tightly with duct tape. Then I pushed it out of the bathroom and slid it down the stairs. Before I went back down, I pulled a blanket from the linen closet. I rolled Julia’s corpse in the blanket and fastened it with the duct tape.

Long before our arrival, all houses in the community were built specifically for American military personnel stationed there. Each house was based on the prototypical home in suburban America. All were equipped with a small standing-height crawl space acting, at that time, as an armory. Other than a few packs of bottled water, ours was largely empty. I removed the rug between the living room and foyer to reveal the door to the crawl space. The spring-loaded handle popped up after pressing a button flush to the floor. Despite the sweltering heat, a cool draft hit me when I lifted the door open. I stepped carefully down the short staircase and lifted the bottled water to the main floor. One after another, I nudged the bodies towards the opening of the crawl space. They teetered on the edge as if resisting such an irreverent entombment. Another nudge to both, and they toppled into their cold and final resting place. I stared at the tightly packed blanket, seeing if it would invoke any feelings in me. Still nothing. I released the door, and it fell shut.
