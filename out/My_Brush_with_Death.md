I worked for a major fast food chain at the time. It was easy work, just sorting pickles and weighing ingredients before they were used to make the burgers. Anyone that's ever worked fast food knows exactly what I'm talking about. At the end of my shift, I said my goodbyes and made my way to the back door. The ground outside was sticky from all the garbage always leaking out when we took it to the dumpster. I hate that feeling(more on that later). The wind was just a lazy breeze for most of my trek home. That is until I passed that house. That squat, yellow house always gave me the creeps.When I approached the yellow house on the corner, the wind moaned into a steady gust. 

And even though that house has been abandoned, just as I was directly in front of it, I saw movement inside the window. I stood there staring at that house trying to spot the squatters or whoever was in there. Nothing but darkness greeted my eyes from inside that green house. I shook my head and finished walking home without any other incidents. I can't believe I saw a skinwalker in that house. I was shaking from fear and excitement. If I trap it, I could be rich; but if it traps me, I'll have to do it's bidding for a period of no less than three weeks(as per the tradition). I tried to tell my parents, but they didn't believe me. They had a business conference later that week, so I would have to wait until then. I bided my time doing simple chores around the house. 

It was really boring, but I couldn't help feeling like I was being watched. The night of the conference finally happened and that's when I learned how wrong I had been this whole time. There was a loud knock on the door, the sort of sound a brick makes when slammed against a cheap couch. I nearly jumped out of my skin. How did they find me? I heard them calling out for me. It sounded like Terry, but I knew it wasn't him because he was at a restaurant with his mom last Tuesday. I yelled for the beast to go away, but made sure not to address it directly. Another loud knock on the door; this time joined by a girl's voice trying to lure me out with her sultry musings, but I wasn't buying it, not this time. I decided to just ignore it until my parents got home. After a few more attempts to trick me, it started viciously pounding on the door. LET. ME. IN. LET. ME. IN. LET. ME. IN. I heard it's voice sizzling away at my brain.

 I couldn't tale it anymore, so I flung open the door and ran past my parents. They looked at me with admiration through their sunglasses as I knocked the luggage out from under their arms. I never stopped running until I finally felt safe a few blocks away. I stopped to catch my breath. I looked arpund while panting like a dog. My heart sank. I was back in front of that spooky blue house where this all started. I decided to take measures into my own hands and started pounding on the door. I tried baiting the monster out by pelting obscenities at it, but no matter how many swears I threw at the beast there was no response. After about twenty minutes I syarted to smell sulphur. I knew that that meant the demon has found a new home to occupy. Let's just hope it hasn't picked my house...
