Trigger warning: suicide

I don’t have many memories of my father’s father, but he will always be burned into my mind. Most kids have fond memories of good times spent with their grandfather, but I never will. My grandfather, let’s call him Bud, killed himself when I was a toddler. 

Bud was an angry alcoholic with a short fuse. My dad has told me horror stories of how him and his siblings would get locked in rooms while their dad flipped the main breaker on and off while screaming like a mad man. Even though he did all of this horrific stuff, I’ve always been fascinated by him. 

I used to beg to spend the night at my grandma’s house because I wanted to dig through his stuff to learn about him. I often wandered the property in hopes of seeing his ghost.  The day he did the deed, it was unbelievably hot. Nobody found him for three days, so by the time my dad stumbled across him, he was pretty rotten. 

I remember one night at my grandma’s, me and my cousin decided to stay up all night to try and summon him. We waited until midnight and went to the hall bathroom. We set up a few candles and turned the light off. The candles cast an eerie glow on the massive wall-to-wall mirror that set us on edge. We had seen movies and had heard about summoning stuff like bloody Mary, so I was confident that we could summon Bud. 

We sat facing the large mirror and began to call his name. We sat there for what seemed an eternity before we decided to give up. Just before I flicked the light on, one of the candle flames started acting weird. It was moving like someone was trying to blow it out. There was no wind, and the other flames were still. 

I suddenly asked if Bud was the reason behind the flame acting weird, and it began to grow. The flame started to grow like someone had started feeding propane into the wick. My cousin freaked out and darted out of the room, slamming the door behind him. Sometimes, there was an issue with the door handle sticking and locking someone in. I reached for the knob, and sure enough, I was locked in. 

I began jiggling the doorknob like I had always done when this happened before. I had become so focused on getting the door open that I was unaware of the candle flames. I realized that it had become brighter in the bathroom. I turned to look at the source, and all of the candles had roaring flames shooting from them. I walked over to the mirror and bent over to blow one out. When I stood back up, I saw him. In the corner of the bathroom behind me was my grandfather. 

His large frame towered in the corner of this tiny trailer bathroom  I jolted around, but he wasn’t there. My hand flew to the light switch, but nothing came on. I looked back in the mirror, but he was gone. I began scanning the entirety of the bathrooms reflection to see if I could see him again. I hadn’t realized it, but I had gotten my face just inches from the glass. Suddenly, Bud's face materialized in front of me. He looked just like his pictures. For a second, at least. His face began to fall as his mouth hung open. The back of his head exploded, leaving a pink mist to coat the bathroom. His eyes rolled back, and his face began rapidly decaying. The sound of gunshots began ringing throughout the room. I was so scared that all I could do was hug my legs and bury my head in my knees. 

The next thing I remember is the bathroom door opening as my grandma and cousin came barreling in. The lights were already in, and my family looked at me like I had two heads before they scanned the room. With a confused look on her face, my grandma asked, “who was in here with you?” I remember being confused at the question, but I responded that I had seen Bud. My grandma's face paled as she grabbed me off of the floor. She rushed us outside and into the car. 
We were miles down the road before anyone spoke. My cousin was the one that broke the silence by saying, “why were you laughing after I left the bathroom?” “I wasn’t!” I responded in a sharp tone. “I saw Buds face and then hit the floor," I explained. My grandma, who had been relatively silent since we left, began to explain what she heard from the other side of the door. 

Apparently, she heard me laughing uncontrollably, and she heard a man’s voice speaking indistinguishable words. My cousin said that he ran out of the bathroom, expecting me to be right behind him. He heard the door slam and assumed I had done it after I ran out behind him. He realized that wasn’t the case when he heard me laughing from inside the bathroom. He banged on the door, trying to get back in. My grandma woke from him banging. When she got to the door, she said she could smell cigarette smoke and heard a gruff male voice say, "Take the shot."

I asked my grandma if the voice sounded like Bud. She said that It sounded like him if he was hoarse, but it sounded like multiple versions of the same voice talking  in unison. She tried to hear what was being said, but when she heard the word “suicide", she threw her shoulder into the door, and it opened. 

Years later, the old trailer was torn down, and a new one was erected on another spot of the property. My uncle and his wife are the new residents. Every so often we have a family get-together at the new house. One night in particular, I had had a few drinks and was a little tipsy. I hadn’t been in a bathroom on that property since the incident. I figured that I would be fine to use the bathroom since it was a new house. 
When I’m drunk, I sit to pee so as not to make a mess. As soon as I sat down, the lights flickered and I heard a a gruff voice in an almost demonic harmony say, “take the shot"  I jumped up off of the toilet, but before I could run out, I looked at the mirror to see Bud's desiccated, worm eaten, rotted face smiling back at me beckoning for me to join him.
