The storm rolled in around 10 p.m., rattling the windows of my tiny apartment. I was on the couch, scrolling through my phone while a news anchor droned on in the background. I didn’t pay much attention until the power flickered, and the screen went black.  

A low hum filled the room, and then the TV turned itself back on. But it wasn’t the news anymore.  

At first, it was static. Then the image sharpened.  

A man appeared, sitting at a news desk. His suit was torn and dirty, his tie askew. His face was gaunt, his skin sallow under harsh lighting. He wasn’t reading from a teleprompter—he was staring directly into the camera, his wide, bloodshot eyes fixed on me.  

“This is a warning,” he said. His voice was raspy, each word trembling with urgency. “If you’re watching this, they’ve found you.”  

A chill ran down my spine. My first thought was that it was some kind of prank, a pirate broadcast maybe. But something about his eyes... they were filled with raw terror.  

“They’ll come to your door. They’ll knock. Do not answer. They’ll sound like people you know, people you want to help. But they are not human.”  

I reached for the remote, but it didn’t work. The TV’s buttons wouldn’t respond either.  

“They feed on fear,” the man continued, his voice dropping to a whisper. “If you’re afraid, they’ll know. And once they know, there’s no escape.”  

The screen went black again.  

I sat there in the silence, heart pounding, until the knock came.  

It was soft at first—three polite raps against the door.  

I froze.  

“Hello?” a voice called. It was a man. He sounded calm, friendly even. “Sorry to bother you. My car broke down, and I need to call for help.”  

My mind raced. Could it be true? Was this some bizarre coincidence, or had the broadcast been real?  

The knock came again, louder this time.  

“Please,” the man outside said. “It’s freezing out here.”  

The TV crackled to life. The man was back, but now his suit was soaked with blood, his face pale and trembling.  

“They’ll lie,” he hissed. “They’ll do anything to get in. Do not—”  

The screen distorted, his face flickering into static, and then the TV shut off entirely.  

The knocking stopped.  

For a moment, I let myself breathe. Maybe it was just someone looking for help. Maybe I was overreacting.  

Then I heard footsteps—slow, deliberate—moving around the outside of my apartment. A second later, a new knock came, this time at the window.  

I turned my head slowly.  

A face stared back at me. It was a man, but his features were wrong. His eyes were too large, his smile too wide, like someone had stretched human skin over something that didn’t know how to wear it.  

“Let me in,” he said, his voice perfectly calm, but hollow, echoing unnaturally in the small space.  

I stumbled back, nearly tripping over the coffee table. The door rattled as something began pounding on it, harder and harder.  

The man at the window smiled wider, his lips splitting, revealing rows of sharp, glistening teeth. “You can’t run,” he said, his voice overlapping with itself like multiple people speaking in unison.  

I bolted for the bedroom, slamming the door behind me. My hands shook as I locked it and grabbed my phone. No signal.  

The pounding continued, now coming from the bedroom window.  

I looked around for a weapon—anything to defend myself. My eyes landed on the closet. Maybe I could hide, wait it out.  

As I moved toward it, the TV in my bedroom flickered on.  

The man was there again, barely recognizable now. His skin was peeling away, revealing something dark and pulsating beneath.  

“You can’t hide,” he said, his voice breaking. His eyes locked onto me, and for a moment, I thought I saw pity. “They already have you.”  

The pounding stopped.  

Silence fell, thick and suffocating. Then I heard it.  

A soft, wet breathing.  

It was coming from behind me.  

Slowly, I turned toward the closet. The door was slightly ajar, just enough to see the darkness inside.  

Something moved.  

And then, as I stood frozen in place, the door creaked open wider.  

Inside was the man from the TV, grinning up at me with hollow eyes and a mouth full of sharp, glistening teeth.  

He stepped out, his movements jerky and unnatural, like a puppet on strings. “I told you,” he whispered, his voice layered and wrong. “There’s no escape.”  

The last thing I saw was his smile.
