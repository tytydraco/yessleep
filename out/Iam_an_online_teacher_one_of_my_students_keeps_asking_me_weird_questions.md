Frankly, i hated calculus. i always had. sometimes i would ram my head against a wall, hating myself for choosing this stream.

but i worked hard. if i choosed this stream, i was going to make it. i will not back down. i will push through. so i worked hard and found a new stream of love for it. so when i became a math professor at a nearby university, i thought of helping other students as well.

i have an online channel that does pretty well. i teach kids calculus and if they have money they give me ten dollars or so in superchat. most of them come to me only when they have an exam, but i still take classes everyday.

When i have free time i make sure i reply to students' questions in the comments. calculus can be tough if you cant pinpoint a certain topic or formula, and the least i could do was to make sure that the kids had their doubts cleared.

it would be the usual ones. limits and continuity or implicit differentiation. i would always answer as quickly as i could, until one day, a user named *Brett_715* would comment on my post.

*Sir, I didn't understand the part where you added two plus two and got four. isn't it supposed to be twenty two?*
I smiled. If this kid was trying to make a joke, be was going to try harder than that.
Somehow, as though he had a camera on me or something, he replied to his comment right away.
*Sir! I need help! Please answer me!*

I frowned. i really had no time for this. i went back to my lecture.
Tommorrow, in another one of my lectures' videos, Brett_715 would comment again. 
'Sir, i didn't understand the part where you added three and three.'

I decided to ignore this kid, kids who want to study can and kids who don't want to study can stray away.
The questions were always basic arithmetic, nothing too hard, only one digit numbers. When the kid would logically ask questions i would reply to him, and i think this kid knew this because they stopped asking these stupid questions.

I had realized that i hadn't seen one of Brett's comments for a long time as i was scrolling through my comments, and like a switch had snapped, there goes brett_715 again, 
'Mr. Newman, i didn't like the part where you added 4 plus 4 and got 8.'
My heart froze. i had never used my name in my lectures, but rather made up a fake name. i was very wary of the internet at times, and i did not want to leak more informatiom other than my face. i even advise my students who watch my lectures to not call me exactly that.

So this kid was in my class. Frankly i had not even added four plus four, the kid was just making things up.
Suddenly, brett_715 replied to his own comment again. 
'Mr. Newman, i don't like the way your eating chips while you are reading this comment.'

My hand shook so badly that it fell down.
brett_715 replied to that comment instantly with 'LOL XDDD'
Was he... reacting to me being shocked?
Am i being watched?
I looked up and down, all around my room to see if anybody was watching.

Tomorrow, i deleted my youtube account because i was shook to my core. i also called the cops yesterday.
i was in a tangle yesterday, hands shaking while looking through test papers. most of them have done well, except for-
My eyes get caught at a single sheet of paper. scribbled on it were the words,

'I don't like how you are going to die today, Mr. Newman.'
