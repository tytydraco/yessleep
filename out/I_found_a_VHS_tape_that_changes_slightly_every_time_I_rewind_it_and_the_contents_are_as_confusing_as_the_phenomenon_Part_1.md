As the title says, I found a VHS tape that keeps changing when I rewind it, yet whats recorded is the most disturbing part. 



For some context on how I came about this tape, I have a somewhat unusual hobby of buying abandoned storage units and sifting through them. Uncovering lost goods that were once something to someone was always alluring to me for some odd reason. I'd been doing it for years at this point.



Most of the time, nothing spectacular came from it: old shelves, books, furniture, pictures, and worn-down everyday items. Sometimes, I would even find some cash, and once, I found a rare collection of old figurines that made me a chunk of change. 



Though I never really did it for the money, I did it for the opportunity to look into the lives of others, see what they wanted to keep and cherish, and then eventually abandon or lose. 



The mystery of the unknown was the part I was attracted to the most. I never really tried to find the owners; they had their reasons for abandoning them, and nothing would come out of me tracking them down. 



My acquaintances may have found my hobby strange, but to me, it was just that- a hobby. It was a way to fill the hours when I wasn't working or socializing, a time I cherished for myself. Their opinions didn't matter to me. 



Still, I never expected it to bleed into my work and social life. It was just a thing I did. 



Then I found a VHS tape —technically, a box of them– but only one stood out.



I was always thrilled to find old journals, CDs, or tapes. It was exhilarating, like opening a mystery box. I never knew what I'd get. Usually, it was just some old music or a personal workbook, but sometimes, I found old home videos or TV shows on the tapes. 



From the get-go, I knew this particular one would be different. Many of the tapes I found didn't have any markings or labels on them, and the ones that did usually just had a description or date of the tapes. 



This one was different than the rest I'd found. It had two backward-facing arrows.



This piqued my interest immediately. And I rushed home that day, eager to see what would be on it. I wasnt prepared, though. Not for what it showed me. Not for what it would do to me. 



In all honesty, I still don't know if the tape is real or not. The contents of it, I mean. The tape itself physically exists, but the story held inside might be fake. A project or film that never saw the light of day. But it didn't *feel* fake to me, at least. Along with the whole ever-changing recording, the ‘fake’ analysis didn't work for me.  



The best way to understand what I mean is to describe what the tape showed (I won't be able to show it to you for reasons I'll explain later), so I'll document what I remember from the first run-through as accurately as possible here. 



This tape is gruesome, and I highly recommend it for those who are easily frightened, have any triggers towards violence, are afraid of blood and gore, or rely solely on logic to form their reality. Stop reading now.



If you are still here, if anyone can explain it to me, I'd be forever grateful.



\*\*\*



The video starts with a young man standing in front of a dilapidated playground; from what I can gather, he seems to be in his early twenties. He is Caucasian, of average height and build, with long brown hair tied up messily, brown eyes, and a large red puffer jacket, blue jeans, and a pair of brown hiking boots. 



The person behind the camera then starts to talk,

“Alright, we are rollin’ now, finally.”



Red Puffer responds, 

“I thought that one was brand new? Whys it on the fritz already?”



“No clue; probably should take it back after we get outta here.”



“Might just be the jank seeping off you,” Red-puffer said with a laugh.



“Shut it.” He said in a joking tone



Red-Puffer scoffs, “I swear you're like a human EMP; all your equipment just wants to kill itself when around you.”



“I know, right? World's shittiest superpower.” he then says in an overly deep and serious voice. “‘Sometimes make electronics stop working, man!’ I'd be famous overnight.”



“I'd be your number one fan, no worries.” He said while waving his hand dismissively 



The cameraman snorts at Red Puffer, dropping the camera's view to the floor. The view shows a pair of worn black boots, dark blue jeans, and a sandy floor that has been overtaken by grass and weeds. He quickly pans back up and sweeps the view around to look at the surroundings.



Cameraman remarks,

“Well, at least you found a kick-ass spot this time.”



The sweeping shot reveals the dilapidated playground, a set of broken swings, a small plastic and metal structure with platforms and stairs leading up to a single, fully enclosed slide that makes one loop before exiting onto the floor. An overgrown chainlink fence surrounds the sandbox that houses the playground \[if you can even call it that\], and a thickly wooded forest stretches beyond in all directions that are shown, with the northern corner of the fencing having a section cut out and a scant path of trampled greenery that fades into the trees behind it. 



The two discuss which shots to take as they appear to be preparing a scene for a film and need an abandoned location for an atmospheric mood. They go back and forth trying out different sweeping shots while Red Puffer recites some lines that go along the lines of,



“Places that once were full of life, now abandoned and forgotten—a place of discarded metal and plastic that will not stand the test of time. Many places like these exist and are akin to our minds, slowly eroding as time passes. Eventually disappearing and then eventually forgotten.”



The camera follows Red Puffer \[whom I will be addressing as Red from now on\] as he monologues. At the same time, he walks around the abandoned grounds and eventually ends up at the top of the slide, where the footage cuts after the cameraman remarks about the good take. 



In the next shot, the camera is positioned a short distance away from the slide's exit at the bottom, capturing the entire structure in the frame while holding it horizontally, with Red standing at the edge of the structure. 



Cameraman then tells him he's ready.



Red continues his monologue,

“Our minds warp and twist things, and around and around we go, trying to solve problems, reach conclusions, and live our lives how we want to, only for the same result. In the end, we are right back where we started. We are nothing before we are born and nothing after we are dead and forgotten.” 



Red then pushes himself down the slide.



\[This is where things stop making sense.\]



In the seconds that Red descends the slide, the feed flickers to a black screen for a moment, and then the camera drops from its position, falling straight down to the ground and tilted sideways, pointed at the slide exit.



Red exits the slide, and the momentum pushes him to his feet.



He stands there stalk still, looking at the area above the camera. After a moment, he looks to his left and then to his right, his eyes wide and fearful.



He calls out

“Evertt?”



Nothing.



His chest rises and falls harshly, and he sucks in a deep, shuttering breath and calls out.

“Evertt!”  
  


He looks around, waiting for a response, but none comes. He calls out again, turning around to look behind the structure. Silence is his only answer.



He turns his attention back to the camera and walks over slowly, shaking his eyes. He looks at a point above the camera, the floor. 



“Evertt?” His voice is quiet and full of disbelief.



He inches closer, and the bottom half of his legs, from his knees down, fills the screen. He stands there momentarily before crouching down and picking the camera up. 



He stares directly into the lens, his face contorted in fear and confusion. He says nothing as he flips the camera around and points it to the ground.



On the ground is a pile of clothes, Evertt’s clothes. His socks were inside his worn black boots, his underwear was inside his dark blue jeans, his belt was still looped and buckled, and his shirt was inside his sweater.



Red mumbles to himself

“W-what the fuck?”



His breaths are uneven and shaky as the camera drops down and flips upside down, Red having let his arms go slack at his sides, still holding the camera.



“This. How?”



Then, in a whisper, he says

“It's like he— where did he go?”



He laughed shakily before bringing the camera back up and scanning the area.



“Evertt, I have no idea how you did that, but it's not funny anymore! You can come out now!”



“Evertt!”



He turns the other way, the camera following his movements.



“Evertt!” His voice cracks as his calls turn into screams, his panic rising.



“This isn't fucking funny, man!”



“Please! Evertt, get out here!”



“Please!”



He walks to the edges of the fencing, calling his name repeatedly.



“Evertt!”



His voice starts to dim.



“Evertt.”



“What the fuck is happening.”



All that can be heard is the shuffling of his jacket and the sand shifting beneath his feet as he walks around the fence line. He reaches the north end and stops before the opening that was cut out of the fence.



He starts to mumble to himself, many of the words barely audible.



“There's no way he made it out here that fast. Why would he, while completely— why? How? Shit, shit, shit, I need to get help. This isn't fucking right!” 



He then takes a step forward, calling into the dense forest. His voice was low and questioning.



“Evertt?” 



He looks back at the pile of clothes one more time before trudging into the forest.



\[He spends the next five minutes walking through the forest, calling for Evertt. The woods are dense and don't let much light through, but it is enough to see where he is going. A few more minutes pass, his calls waning into silence.\]



As Red walks through the forest, he hears a sharp crack from behind him and whips the camera around to scan the tree line; nothing but endless rows of trees greet him, spaced throughout to create a lattice of wood and bark that can't be seen past easily, each trunk as wide as an average person, thousands of trees stretching endlessly in all directions.



He calls out to the air.



“Evertt?”



Nothing.



Red takes a deep breath, slowly turns back around, and keeps walking, mumbling as his pace speeds up drastically.



\[The forest has been almost entirely silent for his entire trek, save for the sounds of his shoes hitting the floor and his body scraping by leaves and twigs. Now, as he starts to walk away from the noise, the trees begin to rustle, and soft tapping sounds can be heard around him.\]



“Man fuck this, no no no no, fuuuuuuccckkk this.”



Red's breathing quickens even further at the sounds now present. He suddenly stops and whips around once more, and the camera catches a glimpse of something pure black fading behind a tree.



Red's breath catches in his throat, and no noise comes from him for several seconds. 



He then breaks into a dead sprint away from the tree, not caring about the camera as he pumps his arms. This only lets us see flashes of color, the sounds of heavy breathing, foliage, and branches being crushed under the heavy pounding of shoes. 



He keeps running, periodically lifting the camera and turning. It’s behind him somewhere; he looks back four more times, all while still running, his breathing heavier and his footfalls louder. Each time, the exact black figure can be barely seen behind a tree, getting closer and closer each time he looks back. 



He seems to trip as the camera suddenly flips and tumbles, and Red can be heard cursing hysterically under his breath. The camera lands ahead of him, now pointing back in his direction, and only the right side of his arm can be seen in the shot.



In the center of the screen, A black silhouette slowly peers around a tree, its form vaguely human. 



\[The best way I can describe it is as if someone had edited it out. It wasnt just black, it was *gone.* Like it had been erased from the footage, it looked over eight feet tall from the silhouette and was vaguely shaped like a human, with a round head and long, spindly arms that weren't fully visible as they melded into the rest of the figure.\]



Red clamored up, grabbed the camera, and pointed it at the silhouette.

He started to yell, his voice shaking and cracking.



“What do you want?!” 



The silhouette froze, its arm and head barely peeking from behind the tree.



Red's voice became quiet again.



“Wha- what the hell?”



Red stood there, his breaths deep and heavy as he stared at the silhouette. After a moment, he took a cautious step back, and as if reacting to him, the silhouette peeked out further from behind the tree in time with his movements.



He took another small step back, and the silhouette came further out.



Red’s hysterical mumblings were all that could be heard in the recording.



“No, no, no, fuck this shit, I can't do this.”



He then took another small step back.



And another.



And another.



Red’s breathing caught in his throat and then went dead as the thing was now fully visible.



\[It seemed slightly hunched over, with two long legs underneath a long, thin torso and arms dangling at its sides, melding into the shadows of the other appendages and body. The silhouette kept shifting and writhing. Only the vague shapes and limbs of the thing could be made out at any one time.\]



Fas, whimpering breaths came from red as he stood there looking at it. 



He took another step back, tripping over the terrain. The camera fell out of his hands and skidded away, forgotten. It landed in a clatter of plastic on a slab of rock, now looking into the deep recess of the forest. Red and the silhouette were out of frame. 



Then, to the left, a cracking sob could be heard. 



Red started to sob quietly as heavy footsteps became louder and louder. As the thing got closer, Red became more and more hysterical.



His sobs turned into guttural screams, making the audio peak and crackle. It was a sound no human should ever have to make. It made me want to get up and run away as far as possible from it, from the pure fear exploding out of him.



He started to yell, begging.



“Please! Please, please, PLEASE!” the last cry coming out from the deepest part of his psyche, his voice becoming hysterical, sobbing halfway through, dry heaving and sputtering. It was a sound that haunts me in my dreams. His voice was raw and dying, moans breaking through each shuddering breath. 



He then kept screaming as it got closer. 



And kept screaming.



A loud, unyielding death rattle that sounded as if he was being pulled apart piece by piece. 



A sick crunch could be heard, and silence followed. 



The crunching continued as blood could be seen seeping into the frame, and the mass of the thing could be heard shifting around. The sounds of flesh and bone ripping and snapping filled the air.



With a loud squelch, Red’s hand fell into frame. The video cut to black for a moment and then ended.



\*\*\*



After watching this for the first time, I sat there stunned, scared, and extremely unnerved. I looked into the black screen for who knows how long as I processed the entire thing that had just played out before me.



I got up and went to get myself a glass of brandy. Looking over the sink, I tried to keep myself from vomiting. 



The sounds, the screaming, the blood. 



It kept flashing through my mind over and over–it still does.



Please let it be fake. I want it to be bogus. It has to be fake, right?



I told myself that it was and walked back to my TV, determined to look back through the tape and find anything that could tell me this was just some film, maybe a boomstick in view or a person on the crew that didn't get out of frame, anything to show it was just some student project that never made it out of the editing stage. 



This is where the second thing that doesn't make sense happened.  



I rewound it to the very start and pressed play, watching as they talked and went through their lines—no other crew or equipment in sight.



Red recited his lines and made it to the top of the slide; it cut, and he stood at the top, then went down.



The camera flickered to black and fell to the floor.



He came out of the slide and then looked down at his hands.



I sat there staring at the screen.



He didn't do that last time. I was sure of it. 



He never looked down until he met the camera's gaze. 



The video continued to play, and nothing else happened. I watched it all again—the screaming, the silhouette, the crunching. 



It was all the same *except* for the start. 



I was sure he had never looked at his hands. 



Was I?



I rewound it, solidifying in my mind what I saw from the last time.



He had come out of the slide,

He looked down at his hands,

He looked left,

Then right,

Then called Evertt’s name while looking right,

Then he looked down at the camera,



I then pressed play from the cut of Red going down the slide.



He came out of the slide,

He looked down at his hands,

He looked left,

He looked right,

He looked up,



He looked up.



It had changed. 



I didn't believe what I was seeing. The recording kept going, and the same actions were repeated. Just the extra step of looking up was different.



I rewound it, taking out my phone and starting a recording from when Red went down the slide.



He came out of the slide,

He looked down at his hands,

He looked left,

He looked right,

He looked up,

Then called Evertt’s name while looking right,

Then, he looked down at the camera.



It was the same as last time.



I paused the video and looked at my recording. 



Except it wasnt there. The recording was, but the video *wasnt*. It was just gone. Like it had been scrubbed out of my recording, not even the sounds could be heard. It was just an empty black void where my TV screen was.



I took a step back and downed my whiskey. 



What the hell was happening?



A video that sometimes changed, only slightly, that couldn't be recorded, that had someone being murdered in it. 



So I planned to go to the police. 



Someone was murdered, and I had the only evidence of it. Expect, was it even real? I debated this as I decided to make a copy, spacing out as I went through the motions. I didn't want to see it again, so I left the room and returned thirty minutes later, my head clearer: more inebriated. 



I checked the copy, but just like my recording, there was nothing, as if it had been taped but wasn't there.



I didn't know what to do at this point. I didn't think the police would take this seriously, and this tape was the only recording of whatever happened in that forest. 



I didn't want to give it to them and have them just say it was fake and toss it. 



I needed to know it would be thoroughly examined and investigated. So I decided to do it.



I know some of you probably think I'm crazy, and I should just take it to the police anyway, but no. Who the hell can explain this? Not the police, that's for sure. I'm not sure I could rest easy not knowing what was happening here. 



I need to know. 



I will periodically post my findings here to see if anyone has any idea or can figure anything out that I can't. Please let me know what you all think of this and if you have any ideas on what to make of it.
