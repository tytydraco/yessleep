After lying in the hospital bed for some time, I decided to open the box.

Instinctively, I opened the card first—it was lying against the lid. Inside was a handwritten note:

“Sorry for hurting you… please take mine.”

What?

The fear began to well up in my throat. I removed the lid from the box and found a small pile of teeth.

**What the fuck!**

I screamed and dropped it. I slammed my nurse call button—no one came. I tried multiple times. Still nothing.

I grabbed the landline. Just beeping. Like the line was busy.

I carefully slid the IV catheters out of my arm and stood up. I stuck my head out the doorway. Nothing. Not a single sound.

I’d spent time in a hospital before, when my grandfather was dying. There was always noise—monitors beeping, carts rolling, voices down the hall.

Now? Silence.

I walked toward the nurse’s station. That’s when I saw it: a pile of meat. Organs. Unidentifiable pieces. A grotesque mound of horror.

**This had to be a nightmare.**

Gunshots rang out. Screams. Radios blaring.

I peeked around the corner—and froze.

A man stood at the end of the hallway, clutching the corpse of what looked like a SWAT team member.

He began gutting him. Calm. Methodical. Like he’d done it a thousand times. Like a hunter cleaning a deer.

Then he looked up.

**ED.**

He smiled—unnaturally wide, exposing toothless, bleeding gums.

He looked like a kid seeing his favorite toy. Then he ran toward me.

I bolted.

I darted into a side room—an employee break room. Inside, a small group of nurses huddled in fear.

I dove under a table in the back just as the hallway filled with the dull *thud-thud-thud* of ED’s approach.

The door exploded open.

The nurses screamed—briefly.

It was over in seconds. Like a seasoned killer, he dipped, ducked, slashed, and ripped.

Then he crept toward me, still wearing that childish grin. He stopped over me.

I looked up and whispered, “What do you want from me?”

He stopped smiling. Thought for a moment.

“I want to be a part of you. I’ve been trying to give myself to you for years.”

It was almost comical how we tried to speak to each other without teeth.

I shook, barely able to speak, but I managed, “Why… why now? Why come back?”

Ed tilted his head like a curious child, then crouched down beside me.

“I couldn’t let you die in that apartment,” he whispered. “If you had died then... the melding wouldn’t complete. I’ve worked too hard for this. You don’t understand what we’re becoming.”

He looked at me almost lovingly, eyes wide and feverish.

“We had to finish what we started when you were a kid. That body… it was too weak. But yours—yours is perfect now.”

Then he began peeling his skin off like he was stepping out of a bodysuit.

“I’ve been watching you for a really long time,” he continued. “I chose you when you were a child.”

My mind reeled. A demonic man-child, tearing himself apart, monologuing like this was all normal.

“I just want us to be together… forever.”

He walked toward me—this time, slower.

Then he slithered against me as I tensed. His nub went back to my mouth.

He started to insert it again. Deeper. And deeper.

I gagged. Heaved.

He kept going.

I felt my upper abdomen start to stretch as his shoulder bottomed out. My jaw was unnaturally wide, like a python unhinged. Skin split around my lips.

Then he jolted—smashed his nub to the left side of my chest. Straight toward my heart.

**Blackness.**

I woke up.

Still in the hospital.

The break room.

The bodies were still around me.

But something was different now.

I still knew who I was… but my perspective had changed.

The corpses? I saw ants. Crushed insects.

**I felt superior.**

I stood up and walked to the bathroom. I looked into the mirror.

He was staring back.

But it wasn’t just my reflection.

It blinked when I didn’t.

I touched my cheek. The reflection smiled.

**I’m trying really, really hard…**

But I don’t think **I’m the one in control anymore.**
