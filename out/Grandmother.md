*Visiting family can be quite dreadful once you hit the age where you become informed of their past. I have always seen my grandmother as a kind old woman, she was frail and used a walker. Unlike most grandmothers, she refused to talk about her past which always confused me how adamant she was when I brought it up.*

 *My parents often sent me away to spend time with her. I never fought them on it but once I turned sixteen-years-old I started to drift away from my family and the average car ride to grandma’s house seemed more exhausting. “Do I have to go?!” I cross my arms sinking down in the backseat of my mom’s shabby, old four seater. “Yes you do Jack. Now quit complaining, She won’t be here for much longer." She said that every time.*

 *We pull into the busted up driveway in the middle of the forest. Her house was old and worn down with mold slowly growing on the brick. I roll my eyes opening the car door and pull my backpack over my shoulder. “Have fun!” My dad rolls down his window and shouts.*



 *I walk up to her old deteriorating front porch as my parents speed off. Before I can knock the door creaks open-. “Hi sweetie!” She waddles over to me, arms open. We hug briefly as she leads me into the kitchen where a warm plate of cookies are sitting out.* 

*She gestures her hands to the cookies. I step towards the counter, picking up a cookie and a red spot catches my eye. The light seems dim as I stare at the cupboard with what seems to be dried blood on the hinges. I step back dropping the cookie, the room still with silence. I slowly turn back to see grandma staring at me.* 

*“What’s the matter? You don't want one?” She inches closer with her walker but I step back.“I’m okay, thanks.” Grandma seemed disappointed in my decision. I walk to the next room over, her vintage living room with an old bulky tv set. The couch is still in good condition despite being older than me.*

 *I place my backpack on the ground next to the tv stand. She follows in behind and sits on her red velvet recliner and turns on the tv. A gameshow plays as she doses off. Grandma always was passed out in her chair almost like she came home from a long stressful shift at work.*



 *I’m not one for snooping but I had to know what that blood was from.I walk around through her dingy long hallway, the light was always broken and randomly flashed. The walls were a faint red color, the wood floor slowly falling apart.* 

*One side of the wall a framed picture was hung, an old picture of my uncle and I at one of my little league games.The photo was taken a few months before he went missing, yet that was the first time I’ve seen it hung up. Underneath the picture was a long table with three drawers.*

 *It was rustic and collecting dust. I reached toward the middle drawer attempting to open it but something had it stuck. I tried to open the left and right drawers and they were stuck too. I run back to the kitchen, but the bloody hinge catches my eye.*

  


 *The door was black while the other doors in the house were white. I reach toward the handle. I hear grandma yell my name, I stay completely silent. I quickly twisted the handle but it was locked. I urgently take the key out of my pocket trying my best to unlock the door.*

 *I swing the door open and step in shutting the door behind me. “Jack!” she screams, her voice oddly becoming deeper. I twist the lock and flip the switch. A flight of stairs sit in front of me, leading to what seems to be a basement. I step down slowly. I get to the bottom and glance around the room to see a room full of boxes stacked on top of each other.* 

*There was a small path uncovered by the boxes. Following the path, more dried up blood appeared as I reached towards the end of the room. At the end sat a lifeless version of my uncle, missing an arm and both his hands. “Jack.” Grandma emerged behind me, she was standing up straight without her walker. I swiftly turned around. “You did this-” I step away from her. She remained silent and put her hand on my shoulder.*

 *I felt a sharp pain in my hip.*
