I hopped out of the car, my feet landing upon the cracked cement of my grandmother’s former home’s driveway. The smell out there was stagnant and musty, and the air seemed…lifeless all around me. A shiver skittered down my spine as I looked at her one story house with the lights off, no warmth or family to greet me.

I walked up the cracked cement walkway that sliced through the dying and dry lawn and the pointed gravel pit where two comically pink plastic flamingos jutted out of. Though, now they both wore a coat of brown dust and had cobwebs in the bends of their necks.

I placed my hand on the white metal handle of the screen door in front of me, clenched it so hard that my tendons groaned. I unlocked the door, and swung it back, unlocking the actual front door and stepped inside the old house, still able to smell the perfume my grandmother bathed in when she had been alive.

I walked down the dark little hallway that ran between the dining room, kitchen and guest bedroom, at the end of the hallway, I saw a blue light, and when I stepped into the cavernous living room, I saw the TV was on, it was on electronic slush, but on none the less.

My eyes scanned the room for anything odd, no one had lived in or had even visited this home in nearly six years, so why was the TV on? I slapped my hand upon the wall and clicked the lights on, nice to see none of the bulbs had burned out. What I did next was really out of habit, but I opened up the fridge.

There were cans of beer in the fridge - grandmother and that side of my family hated alcohol of any form, so why were there cans of beer in the fridge? Down the second hallway, the hallway that led to the guest room, bathroom, office and my grandmother’s room, I heard a door shut. What the fuck? What the fucking fuck?

I walked back to the living room when the TV stopped with the electronic snow, the screen was now black and blood red letters came onto the screen. “LEAVE” was the word those letters had spelled out. “Is anybody in here!? Hello!?” I screamed into the darkness of the hallway.

I had a creepy feeling that lingered in my gut like a sickness. From the window behind the TV, a massive shadow went by causing me to scream. I decided to go down to my grandmother’s room - maybe my uncle had come up for a visit or something? I pushed the door open to see my grandmother looking out of her bedroom window.

“Grandma?” I said aloud.

“Get out of my house!” Screamed my dead grandmother.

What the fuck, what the fucking fuck!? I ran out of that house so fast and got into my car. I sped down the street and haven’t been back since. If anyone else in my family wants to deal with whatever the fuck is happening, they can be my guest because fuck that shit!
