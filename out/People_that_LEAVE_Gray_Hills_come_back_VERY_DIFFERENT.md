I’ve been living in Gray Hills all of my life, all 42 years of it, there’s nothing special about living here; just your typical small town. Yeah I’ve heard the rumors, outsiders say strange things happen here and to be honest I don’t see it, just silly people with their wild imaginations. Most folks know each other, everyone for the most part is friendly, hell I’ve been friends with the same guy’s since elementary, though every once and awhile some escape; move away to do better and bigger things. I use the word escape light heartedly, I don’t think anyone truly escapes from here, its more about a temporary relocation, your body might leave but you’re heart always belongs to Gray Hills; no matter how far you try to get away.  
  
I had a buddy leave once, left on one of those football scholarships, ole Jake was one of a kind; tall and athletic. Honestly I thought the man was invincible and maybe he was, perhaps it was his mind that was weak. I figured when he left he would never come back; not bother to blink an eye for his once home, maybe he would be the one to never return, I mean why would he with such a promising career. It only took him 2 years to make it back, we poked at him for a few days, ‘joshing’ him every chance we got but it was clear Jake came back very different. Something was off about him, he no longer smiled, he didn’t care for much, we would talk about football and he just seemed lost. That’s a good word for it, it was like he was lost in his own mind, nothing excited him, well, almost nothing; one thing he seemed to pick up while he was gone was his desire for food. The man before leaving was a tank of a person and I remember seeing Jake scarf down 2 large pizzas easily, but after returning, his hunger seemed to be limitless. He was always eating, didn’t matter what it was, you handed him any type of food and he would indulge. The funny thing was, it didn’t seem as if he was enjoying the food; just consuming it without thought.  
  
My other friends didn’t think much about it, they just assumed he took one too many to the noggin, after all Jake never told us why he came back, maybe there was something out there that he didn’t like; in their world. I couldn’t accept it, I needed to know why he was different, I asked him numerous times what was wrong with him and he told me he didn’t know. I pleaded with him to go see the doc, get checked out, maybe it was a bug. He never listened to me, instead Jake fell further into his lunacy, sheltering away in his parents basement. He couldn’t find a job that would hire him, they thought of him as being disabled and soon the town slowly forgot about the once rising star, the pride of Gray Hills and eventually like some faded photo; he vanished.  
  
No one knows where he went, most assumed he gave it another shot at the outside world and others had darker thoughts, thinking he ended it all if you catch my drift. Then there were the nut cases, saying he became some type of boogeyman, roaming our streets at night, froth foaming at his mouth like some rabid dog; looking for someone to be his next meal. I personally think he couldn’t take it anymore, the emptiness that overwhelmed him; right before his disappearance he asked me if I believed in a soul. The question left me dumbfounded, I never thought of Jake as being the religious type, I told him I didn’t know; that such questions were beyond my comprehension. This might be the only time I saw a bit of emotion form on his face after returning, it wasn’t one that was clear, at first it looked like sadness but upon further reflection I came to realize it was more of trepidation. I think whatever scared him so bad to come back home had finally caught up to him, I only hoped his demise was quick and not painful.  
  
Others that left were like him, they would leave but come back different, like something was missing; perhaps their soul? I tried not sticking my nose into other peoples business, I usually ignored the chatter and lived my life the best I could. Throughout my life there’s been times where I met some out of towner, telling me to leave with them; promising me a good time but baby blues and a cute smile were never enough to convince me to leave. I even fell in love once with a girl a few towns over, she told me that she wanted me to visit her for once since she was the one that did all the traveling. I made it clear that I wasn’t going anywhere, though, I professed my love for her but also told her that my heart would always remain here, in Gray Hills. We broke up after that and I accepted the fact that I might just die alone, I never married nor had children, instead I shared my love with animals.  
  
I’ve cared for them all, dogs, cats, hell I’ve even had several raccoons. I don’t keep them for long, I usually find a stray and feed them until they feel the need to move on, I don’t blame them for that; there is a large world to see out there. So at least I thought, because one thing I realized by observing these creatures is they usually didn’t leave our small town. Maybe that’s just the nature of animals, they like to stay close to their own environment; dominating new grounds in a small radius but I noticed they never crossed the threshold of our border. Now it’s not like I’m waiting by our town’s welcoming sign to see if they leave, well not intentionally, not at first.  
  
One night I stayed up late, just finished up a 12 hour shift at the dock, the smell of fish engulfed my small house and I felt too defeated to even shower, so I decided to knock back a few. I first started with the six pack that had been in my fridge for far too long and then I moved on to whiskey, by the time I was all out I realized it was past selling hours. Here, we stop selling alcohol at midnight and unless you want some of Rickie's cheap moon shine you have to travel to the town over where they stop selling at 2am. I felt ambitious, more vigor in my blood than usual; perhaps it was the whiskey, either way I some how convinced myself to finally leave. I drove the 5 minutes that was required to leave the border but right before I crossed the thought of Jake flooded my mind, it was darndest thing; I hadn’t thought about him years. I slammed on the breaks and swerved my old Pontiac off to the side into a ditch; barely missing the threshold. 

I panted while my heart fell into my stomach, I looked around the darken tree line and thought ‘that was a close one’. That’s when in my peripheral I noticed the small animal; more specifically a cat. It came sniffing around, clawing it’s paws at the dirt like if it was looking for something. At first I thought it was picking up the scent from the burnt tire marks, but, it didn’t take long to realize it was smelling the borderline; almost the exact line. The small creature sniffed and groaned, like if it was trying to figure out if there were a predator near by. My vision seeped into the shadows, slithering through the darkness and my senses heighten to a level that I didn’t think was possible; I almost felt as if I was the darn critter myself. The feline crept closer, it’s paw teetering almost over the line, it about to cross; it then yelped out with dread, it’s meows triggering a primitive emotion that I couldn’t explain.

That’s when I got out the car and scared it away, I stood there for several minutes catching my breath as my mind spin into a whirl of fragmented thoughts. I looked again at the welcoming sign, it’s illuminated green glow causing my stomach to turn, I realized then no one was welcomed and maybe no one was allowed to leave. Either way the event sparked something awful in my mind, making me come to think why in the world would an animal be so apprehensive to leave, so then it dawned on me; that it couldn’t or maybe shouldn’t. So my observing began, I wanted to know if another animal would leave; I waited to see if another would cross.  
  
I set up a small tent right up next to the line, hell, I even took a week off from work; the bastards been bugging me to use my vacation time for months so I figured why not use it on this thought experiment. The first day was dull, I saw nothing other than the usuals leaving for their boring office jobs that were located a town over, but other than that it there was nothing eventful. It wasn’t until day 3 that I contemplated the idea of giving up my endeavors but almost like if it was divine intervention itself, a small critter came up to the borderline; a small rabbit. The dam thing did the same as the cat, it’s floppy ears gyrated all over place trying to pick up some threat, I held my breath not wanting to scare it away, it sniffed the floor and inched closer to the border. Like the cat, I saw some panic in it’s eyes, like it was under attack and it scurried away back into the brush; it not setting one paw across the line.  
  
This dam mystery really inundated my thoughts and I wanted to know what the heck was going on; so I camped out for weeks on end, documenting the different occurrences. It was always the same, small animals would sniff the line but never cross, while our traveling townsman would leave and come back. I didn’t know everyone in town, but by the time I was done camping out the faces of who would leave were burned into my mind. It didn’t take long to figure out who they were, usually it were the richer people, the ones that had some education; people that thought they were too good for Gray Hills. It started to make sense, those business folks always felt like they didn’t belong, as if they weren't’ from here and now I realized they were leaving on a daily basis, maybe there was something to that. Whatever the hell was happening to them once they crossed the line was unknown, but whatever it was I knew it was changing them.  
  
My little experiment left me confounded, I really didn’t know what to think, whatever the hell was happening out there wanted to get into here. They say the devil wears many masks, but more certain it wears the one that you see everyday, I really don’t know if whatever it is made it’s way in a long time ago or perhaps it waits right on the other side of the threshold. Just maybe it want’s people to leave, perhaps that's the reason for all this bizarre talk about Gray Hills being mysterious; maybe it’s not us different but them. I just want to leave it be for what is, I have no desire to seek answers, I know that understanding these questions are non of my business, though someone new has just moved to Gray Hills, someone that seems a bit off. His name is Tom, some young fellow that just happened to wander on to our little community; tells us how much he loves it here. He now works at the dock, guts the fish like he’s been doing it all his life; something about the man is just too familiar. His jokes his mannerisms, there’s something about him that I can’t place my finger on.  
  
One day we go out for pizza, the man scarfs down two large with out a blink, he then goes on about football and how he’s going to be a star one day, I laugh, telling him I had a buddy like that once. Though my laughter soon fades as Tom turns to me with a cold dead stare, the usual warmth that protrudes from his charm dissipates, in the moment I felt my knees weaken, the silence that grew between us only escalated my anxiety. I honestly didn’t know what to think, perhaps he thought I was belittling his dream? I tried getting up to leave but he then placed his hand on my shoulder, his grip was ice cold, he then stared into my eyes. 

I shudder, trying to look away but I was drawn to his welcoming eyes as if I were allured by some supernatural spell and he tells me something that makes my skin curl, he tells me Jake is now a part of him. I stared on with little thought trying to grasp the words of what he was saying, I never told him Jakes name, what did he mean that he was now a part of him? I gasped out with disgust thinking it was some sick joke but the grin that formed on Tom’s face made me realize that this was no gag. I wanted to ask the man what he meant, where was Jake, but the only thing that came out of my mouth was pure gibberish; word vomit and the mutters that flowed off of my lips only showcased how timid I really was.  
  
I’m not proud to say but I was so frighten that I ran back home, locking all of my doors and windows; I even slept with the lights on. The next day I dreaded going to work, not wanting to see Tom, but I was told that no one by that name ever worked for the dock. Now most might think I’ve lost my marbles by everyday that I’m saying, but anyone that knows me knows me as a man of integrity; I don’t do any drugs and everything I’ve witnessed about our border or Tom is the truth.  
  
I decided to let sleeping dogs lie, like I’ve always said I don’t go around sticking my nose where it don’t belong, but as of lately I’ve been getting strange texts from a number I don’t have stored in my contacts. They say they’re Tom, but worse they tell me to come to see them; that they want me to cross the line. Like I’ve said before, my heart will always belong to Gray Hills and I planned on never leaving but something about those messages make me want to go to the border and cross, maybe it’s time to find out what happen to Jake. I don’t know how much longer I can hold off the urge of going, my mind tells me no but my soul is drawn to the outside, though one thing is for sure, it is not us — the people of Gray Hills that is bizarre but the outside world, perhaps they are stealing our souls.
