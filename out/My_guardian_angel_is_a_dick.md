I'm 18 years old. The last few months have been really hard for me. I lost my family in a car crash. Some truck driver got drunk. I didn't know what to do as my mom, dad, and sister were all I'd had. Sure, there also was this stupid brother Ian, but we'd rarely talked about him since he'd stole most of our money and left us without a goodbye a year prior. With no one to ask for help and support, I decided to kill myself.

It was a great summer morning. Sunny but not too hot. The birds were happily chirping to attract a potential partner. A shame I was to die.

I signed and jumped off the bridge. Imagine my surprise when, instead of hitting water, I flew back on top. That was when the fear started. Oh my God! I'd just tried to kill myself, to be either drowned or hit to death; not pleasant either way.

As I stood there, hyperventilating, an entity appeared. It looked like a tall human in white and it had wings.

"I'm your guardian angel", it said, "and simply cannot let you destroy your immortal soul."

I obviously didn't like the idea of angels existing and dictating our lives.

"Why didn't you save my family then?! There wouldn't be a need to save my soul!"

Before I could say something else or hit it, the angel disappeared.

After days of crying I decided that the whole revelation thing had been a product of my imagination. I bought a rope and learnt to tie a noose. Unfortunately, when I kicked the chair, I just fell to the floor. The rope was cut! I looked up to see the angel from before.

"Why don't you reach out to your brother instead? Here's his address."

Maybe I should. Who knows, maybe I should give him one more chance.

So the day before yesterday I went to visit him. I rang the doorbell.

"Who's this?"

"It's me, Laura! I just wanna talk."

He opened the door and I went inside.

"So, have you been accepted to you dream college?"

"Yes, but it certainly took a lot of effort."

We talked for a while and everything was fine. We would practically finish each other's sentences. I almost forgot about how miserable I'd been before. Until I told him about our family's demise.

"Yeah, finally they got what they deserved! Should've happened long ago!"

I couldn't control myself. All my pain and suffering, it turned into blind rage at that moment. I grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed him in the chest until he wasn't breathing anymore. Then panic kicked in. What should I do?! Why didn't the angel stop me? Was I going crazy with grief? Would I be imprisoned?

And then the angel appeared, its face now showing smugness instead of sympathy.

"Yeah... One of Heaven's citizens didn't want you there. Too bad suicide isn't enough to send to Hell. Well, good luck, or whatever."
