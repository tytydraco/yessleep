Title: The Hollow Man of Ashgrove City

Pre-entery.

In the waning days of the 1990s, the city of Ashgrove sits under a veil of neon and rain. Its streets hum with the low buzz of power lines and broken dreams, a city where people disappear, and no one asks why.

When Clara Wynn, a quiet 19-year-old college student, spends a weekend home alone while her parents are away, she expects nothing more than a few nights of solitude. But as the city’s power flickers and an unfamiliar number begins to call her landline, Clara realizes she isn’t truly alone.

A man has begun following her. A tall, pale, with eyes that never quite blink and a smile that doesn’t belong to this world. At first, he seems like a stalker. But soon, the truth becomes impossible to deny: he isn’t human. He wears human skin like a borrowed coat, mimicking voices, gestures, even memories that aren’t his own.

As Clara runs through the dark arteries of Ashgrove, from her apartment’s cracked corridors to the silent subway tunnels and the forgotten riverfront. She begins uncovering the city’s secret: a rift beneath its foundations where something ancient feeds.

Each step draws her closer to the heart of it  and to the truth about who she really is, and why the demon has chosen her.

Visceral. Relentless. Drenched in dread.
The Hollow Man of Ashgrove City is a descent into urban isolation and supernatural horror.   A story of survival, courage, and the thin, trembling line between the living and the hollow.

Chapter I

My name is Clara Wynn, and I’ve told this story a hundred times to detectives, to journalists, to strangers who call me brave, to others who call me delusional.
But I only ever tell the truth.
And the truth is that I should have died that night in Ashgrove City.

It started on a Friday, October 17th, 1997. The kind of night that sits wet and heavy on your skin. The city had that low hum again, that static electricity that makes you feel like a storm is watching you. My parents had gone to visit my aunt in Clearwater, a three-hour drive away. I was nineteen, in my second year of college, and convinced I could handle being alone for the weekend.

Our apartment was on the twelfth floor of the Marroway Complex, an old brick building that used to be a hotel before the renovations. You could still feel the bones of its past, the faded floral wallpaper under layers of paint, the echo of doors that didn’t exist anymore.

I spent the early part of the evening cleaning, making popcorn, and watching reruns of The X-Files. The city lights outside my window looked like stars drowned in dirty water. I remember thinking it was comforting being up high, untouchable.

Then, around 9:46 p.m., the phone rang.

Not my cell, the landline.
The one no one ever used.

I almost didn’t answer it. I wish I hadn’t.

When I picked up, there was a man’s voice. Calm. Polite.
He said, “Is this Miss Wynn?”

I said yes. He paused.. too long and then said, “You should really lock your window.”

I laughed, thinking it was someone from college pulling a prank. But something about his tone…
It wasn’t teasing. It wasn’t even threatening.
It was observant.

I looked over at the living room window, the one that faced the street. The curtains were half-drawn. I couldn’t see much beyond the glass, just the faint reflection of my own face.

When I turned back, the line had gone dead.

I stood there for a while, holding the phone, listening to the dial tone. Then I hung up, locked the window, and tried to laugh it off.

But the thing about laughter, it doesn’t chase fear away. It just gives it a place to hide.

It was an hour later when I saw him.

I had gone to the kitchen for another soda, the TV still murmuring in the background. The lights flickered the way they always did when the elevator ran. But this time, the power didn’t come back right away.

Through the brief slice of darkness, I caught something at the corner of the window. A silhouette.
A tall figure standing across the street under the orange streetlight, his face tilted upward staring directly at my floor.

When the power came back, I thought I’d imagined it. But he was still there. Still staring.

I remember whispering, “Jesus, who are you?”

And for a moment, I thought he answered.
Not through the glass. Not through the air.
But inside my head.
A voice that wasn’t mine, soft and deliberate: “You already know.”

I stumbled back and knocked the soda off the counter. When I looked again, he was gone.

That should’ve been the end of it. I should’ve called someone, the police, my parents, anyone. But I didn’t.
Because part of me, the rational part, still believed I was being paranoid.

I went to bed around midnight. The city rain had turned to mist, sliding down the window like slow tears. I left my desk lamp on, because the dark didn’t feel safe anymore.

I woke up just after 2 a.m. to a sound.
three slow knocks on my apartment door.

Not frantic. Not random.
Measured.
Knock... knock... knock.

My heart was beating so hard it hurt. I slipped out of bed, padded across the carpet, and pressed my ear against the door.

A man’s voice came through, muffled by the wood.
“Clara? It’s me. It’s your dad. I forgot my keys.”

Every part of me went cold.
Because my father’s voice was right, pitch-perfect.
But my parents were in Clearwater.

And then came the sound that still wakes me sometimes, the sound of metal scraping slowly against the lock.

He wasn’t knocking anymore.
He was trying to open the door.


I backed away, too afraid to breathe. Then I remembered the window. I thought maybe I could call for help, wave down a neighbor, anything. I ran to the living room and yanked the curtain aside.

And there he was.

The same man I’d seen under the streetlight.
Only now he was on the fire escape, his pale hands pressed against the glass.

His face.
God, his face wasn’t right. The skin was too tight, the smile too wide, and when he blinked, it looked painful, like a habit he didn’t fully understand.

He whispered something I couldn’t hear, but I swear I felt it in my bones, the same voice that had spoken inside my head.
“Let me in, Clara. You called me.”

I didn’t remember calling anyone.
But in that moment, as he pressed his face to the glass, I realized something awful.
He didn’t mean I’d called him on the phone.
He meant something else. Something older.

And when I blinked, he was gone.

That was the night it began.
The night the city stopped feeling like home.
The night I learned that some doors, once noticed, can never be unseen again.

Chapter II 

I didn’t sleep after that.
I sat on the couch until dawn, watching the window and waiting for the first gray light to bleed into the room. The city always feels quieter at sunrise like the world takes a breath before it remembers how to live again.

When I finally stepped outside, everything looked painfully normal.
The streets were slick from last night’s rain, buses hissed past, and old men in coats smoked by the corner store. No one looked at me twice. No one looked up at the twelfth floor.

I almost convinced myself it had been a dream. Almost.

But then, across the street, I saw a reflection in the café window, a tall shape in a dark coat, motionless amid the blur of morning commuters. When I turned to look, there was no one there.
Just that faint shimmer in the glass, still holding its shape.

That was when I realized something strange:
The reflection wasn’t of a man.
It was of something standing behind me.

I spun around, nothing.
But the cold that followed felt alive, like a hand brushing the back of my neck.

I spent the next two days trying to drown myself in routine. Schoolwork, errands, anything to make me feel ordinary again. I even told a friend, Lydia, about the call, about the man I thought I’d seen. She laughed nervously, said I probably watched too many horror movies, and told me to “get out more.”

That night, she invited me to meet her at a bar near Old Market Square, a place with cheap beer and worse lighting.
I remember hesitating, staring at my phone, trying to decide whether leaving my apartment would make me safer or put me closer to him.
In the end, I went because being alone felt worse.

The city was alive that night. Horns, laughter, the hum of televisions behind open windows.
But beneath it all, there was a pulse I couldn’t shake. A rhythm just out of sync with the city’s heartbeat. Like something else was breathing through it.

When I reached the bar, Lydia was already there, waving from the booth near the jukebox. We talked for an hour about nothing, everything, anything but him. I almost felt normal again.

Then I saw him through the window.

Standing across the street, under the neon sign of a pawn shop.
Still. Watching.

I blinked and he was gone.
But a moment later, the payphone outside the bar rang.

No one was near it.
Yet it rang and rang until I couldn’t stand it anymore.

Lydia frowned. “Don’t even think about it,” she said. But I did.
I walked outside and lifted the receiver.

No sound. Just breathing.
Then a whisper, soft enough to feel like it came from behind me instead of through the phone:
“You shouldn’t have left the window open.”

I dropped the receiver and ran.

I don’t remember much of the run home, just flashes.
Rain starting again. A flickering streetlight that went dark as I passed. Footsteps that weren’t mine, echoing just a beat too late.

When I reached my building, the lobby lights were out.
The elevator was broken, its doors half-open like a mouth frozen mid-scream. I took the stairs two at a time. My key slipped twice in the lock before the door gave way.

Inside, the apartment was dark except for the faint glow from the city below. I shut the door, bolted it, and pressed my back to it, gasping.

That’s when I heard the television turn on by itself.

The screen glowed blue, no sound, no channel just static. I hadn’t touched the remote. It lay on the coffee table where I’d left it that morning.
And then, through the static, a figure appeared. 
Blurry, moving closer to the camera, until I could see eyes. My eyes.

It was me on the screen.
Only I wasn’t moving the way I moved.
My reflection smiled when I didn’t. It lifted its hand, palm to the glass, like a mirror trying to escape.

The phone rang again.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.
Instead, I unplugged it, ripped the cord from the wall, and still it kept ringing.

That’s when I realized it wasn’t coming from the phone.
It was coming from inside the television.

And through the crackling static, that same voice whispered, closer than before:
“You called me, Clara. You wanted to be seen.”

The room went dark.

When the lights came back, it was morning again.
My front door stood open.
And on the carpet, in front of it, was a single wet footprint, long, bare, and facing inward.

That was the moment I stopped believing I was losing my mind.
Because madness doesn’t leave footprints.

Chapter III

I didn’t leave my apartment for three days.
Every sound in the hallway made my heart trip over itself, the clatter of pipes, the buzz of the elevator cables, the whisper of someone’s shoes on the linoleum.

But the silence was worse.

By the fourth morning, I realized that fear was starting to feel like oxygen, I could only breathe if it was around. And that terrified me more than him.

So I left.

The air outside smelled like rust and rain. I kept my head down as I walked, counting cracks in the sidewalk like prayers. I wasn’t sure where I was going until I found myself standing in front of the Ashgrove Public Library, a place that hadn’t changed since I was a kid, tall windows, dust thick enough to see your reflection in it.

Inside, it was quiet in that particular way old buildings are quiet. Where the air feels full of whispers that never learned to fade.

I went to the archives desk and asked for anything about the Marroway Complex, the building where I lived. The clerk, a thin woman with silver glasses, frowned.
“You live there?” she asked, as if I’d said I lived inside a grave.

When she returned, she set down a single box. “That’s all that’s left,” she said, and wouldn’t meet my eyes.

The files smelled like mildew and secrets.
Newspaper clippings from the 1950s and 60s, when the building was still the Marroway Hotel. A few yellowed photographs. And a single incident report dated October 17, 1959.

The headline read:
 “Missing Woman Last Seen at Marroway Hotel, Witness Claims She Spoke to Herself in the Mirror.”

I felt my stomach twist. October 17th — the same date everything had started for me.

The article said the woman’s name was Elena Wynn.
Wynn.
My last name.

At first I thought it had to be a coincidence. But as I read further, the coincidence turned into something colder. Elena was nineteen. She’d been staying alone while her parents were away. She’d told a friend that a man kept calling her, a man who spoke in her father’s voice.

The last line of the article was short, almost casual:

“Hotel room found empty. One set of wet footprints discovered near the window.”

I don’t remember leaving the library.
One moment I was staring at that headline; the next I was outside again, the city noise pressing in like water against glass.

I must’ve walked for hours, not really seeing where I was going. Every window seemed to hold a reflection that didn’t move when I did. Every sound felt like footsteps a few beats behind me.

When I finally stopped, I was standing at the edge of Riverside District, the oldest part of Ashgrove. Where the city had been built on top of itself, layer after forgotten layer.

And that’s when I heard it again.
My name.

Soft, like someone exhaling it just beside my ear.

I turned and saw him halfway across the street, between two flickering lamps. The Hollow Man.

He looked the same, but worse. His outline was starting to blur, like the air around him was bending. His head tilted, and though he was too far to touch me, I felt a pressure against my chest, like fingers pressing down through the air.

I whispered, “What do you want from me?”

He smiled.
“To finish what was started.”

And then he was gone. Not vanished, exactly, but unmade, like he’d been swallowed by the city’s light.

That night, I couldn’t go back to the apartment. I found myself at Lydia’s door instead, shaking and half-delirious. She didn’t ask questions, just pulled me in and locked the door behind me.

Over tea, I told her everything about the calls, the man, the name in the newspaper. When I said “Elena Wynn,” her expression changed.

“Clara,” she said slowly, “I’ve heard that name. There’s a mural downtown, old, faded thing under the overpass near Ashgrove Station. People say it’s haunted. The woman in the painting… she looks like you.”

We went there the next day.
The mural was half-hidden under graffiti and grime, painted on cracked brick. The colors had bled together over decades, but the face, the face was unmistakable.
She looked exactly like me.

In her painted eyes, someone had scratched three words:
“SHE CALLED HIM.”

And beneath that, in newer paint, almost fresh:
“AND HE ANSWERED.”

I don’t know how long we stood there.
But when we turned to leave, I noticed something I hadn’t before, on the far side of the underpass, someone had drawn the outline of a man. No details, just a hollow shape in black paint.

And from where I stood, it seemed to line up perfectly with the shadow that fell across me.

I started to believe then that Ashgrove wasn’t just haunted.
It was watching.
Like the city itself was waiting for me to remember something I wasn’t supposed to forget.

Chapter IV

The night after I found the mural, I dreamed of water.
Black water, rippling under street-lights that floated like dying stars. A woman’s face looked up from beneath the surface. My face, but older and when her mouth opened, the city lights went out one by one.

I woke to Lydia shaking me. “You were talking in your sleep,” she whispered. “You kept saying his name.”
“I don’t know his name,” I said.
She just stared at me. “You said Hollow. Over and over.”

By morning I couldn’t stay still. There were too many fragments that didn’t fit: Elena Wynn, the Marroway, the mural. They were all pieces of a story that felt half-remembered, half-inherited.

I went back to the library, but the archive box was gone. The clerk with the silver glasses wasn’t there either. A younger man filled her place, and when I asked about the Marroway files he blinked at me like I’d spoken another language.

“We don’t keep anything that old anymore,” he said. “Those records were destroyed years ago.”

I felt the world tilt. “I was just here. Three days ago. The files were real.”
He only frowned. “The Marroway? That building’s been empty since the fire.”

“Fire?”

He nodded. “Back in the seventies. Whole top floors burned out. No one’s lived there since.”

I left without another word.
Outside, the city looked wrong, angles sharper, air heavier. People moved like clockwork figures, never looking at me directly. For a moment, I thought I could see their reflections in the glass storefronts turning a fraction slower than they did.

At the bus stop, a pay-phone rang.
No one else turned.

I picked it up before I could think.

“Clara,” the voice said.
Not his voice. A woman’s. Soft, tremulous.
“Don’t go back there.”

“Who is this?”

The line hissed. Then, faintly, “He remembers the fire.”

Click.

Lydia met me at the end of East Riverside, where the oldest tunnels cut beneath the city. She had found a map online, the old subway lines that had been sealed after a cave-in decades ago. One line ran directly under the Marroway site.

“Whatever he is,” she said, “maybe that’s where he came from.”

The tunnel mouth gaped behind a rusted gate. We slipped through. The air smelled of iron and rot. Our flashlights shook in our hands.

The deeper we went, the more the city above seemed to fade. Drips echoed like footsteps. A low hum threaded the darkness, steady, living.

Then Lydia stopped.
“Do you see that?”

At the far end of the tunnel, light pulsed faintly  a sickly, blue-white glow. As we neared it, shapes appeared on the wall: dozens of faces painted in ash, each one identical to the woman from the mural. Each one identical to me.

In the center of the wall, a hollow outline of a man had been carved directly into the stone.

From within it, water seeped black and slow, forming a pool at our feet.

And in that water, a reflection moved.
Not mine.
His.

The voice rose from the tunnel itself.
“You came home.”

Lydia screamed. I grabbed her arm and ran, the light behind us flaring until it burned white. The sound followed not footsteps, but breathing, close enough that the air trembled against my back.

We didn’t stop until we burst into the night again, lungs raw, the gate clanging shut behind us.

When we looked back, the tunnel was dark, silent, as if nothing had ever been there.

But Lydia’s flashlight, the one she’d dropped, lay just inside the gate, still on.
Its beam pointed down at the ground.

A single wet footprint.
Facing outward this time.

That was the night I understood the truth:
He wasn’t haunting me because of who I was.
He was haunting me because of where I came from.

And the city, my city was helping him remember.
