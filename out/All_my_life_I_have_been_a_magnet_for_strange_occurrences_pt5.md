My bedroom in the Adirondacks faced the eyes of the forest. 


Every green and blazing through the night. 


During the fall months we would throw dried corn over the fence once we were finished with the decoration of it all. The deer and animals would come to collect the corn and munch happily. 


This inadvertently allowed me to catch many strange glimpses of the forest. Teams of deer, coyotes, but strangely enough a woman and her child. I knew full well she was not real, evidently by her timely Native American garb and the fact that her child never aged, remaining in lifeless sleep on her back. She collected the corn, whistling quietly a very strange song unlike any other I know even now. 


Is this what they mean by ‘song of the dead’?


I never spoke to her but often times we would catch each other’s eye and I often smiled or waved at her. She only ever smiled back at me. She walked freely amongst the deer and animals and I envied her in a strange way. When the deers grazed and even when they bickered with the noisy crows. When the coyote cashed the deer she didn’t intervene but she watched with a melancholic gaze but never turned her head away even when the bones snapped and flesh squelched between fervent jaws. Although we couldn’t interact or speak, she taught me so much through her eyes. I could feel her lesson, her words, consumption is part of it all. 


Consumption is nature. 


There was more than that to learn though. Every night the coyotes chased the deer. 


Every night the feral footsteps kicked up dirt and time stood still as they rounded the corner out of my windows direct sight. Every night the growls and barks and yowls sounded off in my ears. The huffing and growling and screaming as flesh was torn. No matter what it happened exactly the same every night. 


Sinew snapping,


Huffing, 


panting, 


wet squelching;


all of which made my heart race. 


I wonder now, did I want to be the wolf or the deer? 


I’m curious what this could have been. On its surface it appears obvious. It’s ghosts right? 


But I’m not so sure. After this I began to observe strange anomalies that I was not always aware of until reflecting upon them later. The strangest one was the mysterious wax museum. It was no ordinary wax museum and has slipped the consciousness of everyone I could contact who would have known about it or been there with me. Despite this and despite knowing the general time frame there seems to be no knowledge of the wooded halls I walked with my classmates on that invisible field trip.


Perhaps this is why time and I have only ever been distant lovers. 


Have you ever thought, perhaps that’s all ghosts may be? Time dilation? Perhaps it’s simply shattered fragments of what is left behind when you imprint your soul on a place or time. 


Running in circles through the last reverie of our consciousness in our final seconds between that last inhale and exhale. Reverie woven amongst the vibrations of an elongated death rattle. 


Do you think I’m alive?
