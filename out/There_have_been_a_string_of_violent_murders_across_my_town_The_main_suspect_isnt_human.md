Out of all of the cases that I’ve had as a criminal investigator, this one is probably the one I tell to only a few people. Though I guess that wouldn’t quite pan out.. since I’m typing this now. 

I’ve had my fair share of freaks and creeps in my day. Serial killers that collected pieces of their victims. Sick freaks, perverts, all of that. But this case is different.  
  
To save my own ass and not get in trouble, I’ll be switching names and keeping the location vague. Though I doubt that will do me any favors due to how nutty and….unique this case is. 

For reference, I work within a state that has lots of forests, mountains and nature that creeps around into the cities and towns. The type to become one of those Hallmark fall town during the fall seasons and winter wonderland covered in snow and ice during the cold months A vast majority of was…and to be truthful, still native land, and as such is kept in condition by the local tribes and conservationists.  
  
With this of course is a very easy way for people to get lost and potentially killed within these forests, so there have been plenty of meetings and such to prevent the amount of inevitable losses.

Though recently there have been a large string of murders happening in recent months. Young adults or hikers would go into the forest and not come back…only to resurface brutally killed. All of them have the same sort of markings / causes of death. 

Take for example the first victim. A 30 year old man named “Charles.” He was found dead near a river bed. His entire torso seemed to be ripped out…his organs that he had left hung out from the hole that used to be his body and his limbs covered in bruises and deep gashes that resembled claws.  
  
Everyone, including me, thought he was attacked by a bear or a large animal that had contracted rabies…since they’re very common within those areas. But after closer inspection.. me and the other investigator would come to find out that wasn’t the case. 

More and more bodies would show up. Some would have entire limbs bitten off or half of their body just…missing. It was some sickening shit, and the local department soon realized that they had a lot more than bears on their hands. 

That’s when me and my partner, Miller would be put onto the case. 

Miller was a younger man, about 25 years old. Charming and “handsome” as the elderly woman and some of the younger girls would point out. He was new to the town and had transferred to our neck of the woods when the opportunity came about. Nice kid, though the moment he came couldn’t have been any worse.  
\_\_\_\_

Another body showed up, deep in the forest dangling from a thick tree branch. The same as the rest...the torso almost devoured whole and the right arm missing.  
  
Luckily for the crew involved, we didn’t have to worry about the large crowds that would pile up whenever a new body was discovered closer to town. All the nearby residents would come and watch..weirdly enough. Curious tweens and teens would try and sneak a peak of the body…and be sick right after seeing the disaster, and older folks would say a silent prayer as if their words would help guide the lost soul to the pearly gates up above. 

Me and Miller stood at the edge of the police tape, silence filled the air besides the shuttering of the camera for evidence and the crunch of fallen dead leaves. No one spoke. The same despondent look of ‘Lets get this over with’ was wrapped around their faces. It was just another day of cleaning up organs and looking at the mutilated faces of the dead.  
  
“There’s no *way* that another person could manually put the victim in the tree like that…”  
  
Miller muttered breathlessly. And he was right. The branch that held the victims body was at least a good couple feet off the ground. No person was able to hoist the body onto the branch like that unless they had gear...and even then what was even the purpose of that? None of this was making any sense, but then again, this entire string of mishaps were just illogical. 

“Aye, come take a look at this!”

One of the forensics men called out to the two of us, his gloved hands waving us over as he kneeled on the ground over something.  
  
Upon closer inspection, it was a large book. It was worn with age...probably older than me and a vast majority of members in the department itself. A strange symbol was imbedded into the leather binding, colored in with a now faded shade of gold.  
  
“Looks like something ya’ll would need. Smells like shit but it seems important.”  
  
The man shook his head. He wasn’t wrong, the book smelled like something that had died long ago, rotting and the very back of a library…where no one touches the books and they’re left to decay in the shelves for longer than needed.  
  
After the book was sealed into an evidence bag, Miller taking a closer look at it with gloved hands and a crossed expression.  
  
“Haven’t seen anything like this before. I thought it was some sort of satanist symbol at first but….this looks a whole lot different.”  
  
“Are you saying you’re an expert at some weird demonology stuff, Miller?”

“Not at all... I think my hours of binge watching horror movies would have lent me a clue as to what it could have been.”

The look on my face seemed to be enough for him to chuckle and take back what he said.  
  
“Anyway. We should probably get a look at this once we get back to the station. It seems important.”  
\_\_\_\_

After the initial cleanup, me and Miller stood around the book in the evidence room. The book itself in the blinding fluorescent lights showed its age. The leather that bound the book together was basically decaying…nothing like the fake stuff you’d find in some bookstore. The pages were a deep yellow and beige color..coated with mysterious stains. 

This thing was a lot older than I had thought. Probably from the 1800’s if I were to guess…probably even further back. How the hell did the victim even get this sorta thing?  
  
“No time to waste. Let’s see if this thing could lend us a hand on this investigation.”  
 

Miller carefully opened the book. It started off as most published books do, but when he focused on the words on the paper, he took pause.  
  
“*….What the fuck does this say?*”  
  
Latin. All of it was in latin. But from what we could see, it was some type of book containing things such as faces, anatomy, and a whole bunch of other stuff that you would typically see somewhere in a biology book, or something related to evolution but it it was for something….different.  
  
The people, or really things I should say, weren’t human. They had digitigrade legs. The legs themselves morphed right where the knee would be for us and became what I can only assume to be goat legs or something of the like. Their feet were hooved, hands ending in long nails…or claws and from the colored ink that was left…varying skin tones from pinks and reds to greens and blues. Hell, there were even sections that included different horn shapes and tail shapes and sizes. Though that information was only for the first 80 or so pages before being separated by a page and a small title within the center. A separate entry.  
  
“Theres no way that the victim could understand this. Even if they just looked at the pictures they wouldn’t grasp what the text was even saying.” Miller shook his head and closed the book. He seemed disappointed…perhaps over the fact that we couldn’t yet find a lead to all of these deaths.  
  
“Calm down Miller. I have a friend that can read latin… I’ll send it over to him and try to see what we can get out of it.”  
  
“You’re not messing with me right??” Miller whipped his head to look at he with distrusting eyes “In what day and age can someone casually read latin?”  
  
“A linguist, Miller.”  
  
The shift in Millers face was almost instant, turning from frustration to embarrassment and clarity all in one neat package.  
  
“Right… We’ll go ahead and contact him. If it’s anything important we’ll bring it forward.” Miller nodded, before leaving the room quietly.

As he left, I stood there in that quiet room for what seemed like minutes…looking back down at that beat up book. Something about it compelled me to keep looking. To keep discovering what I couldn’t understand. And that was the point where I think I took a path that wouldn’t lead back to the reality I knew.  
\_\_\_\_

The next section read like a journal entry. Pages upon pages of notes, short paragraphs and so on sprawled over copious amounts of pages until I uncovered more diagrams.  
  
These looked so much more different than the diagrams before. A lot more disturbing than I thought possible.  
  
It showed sickness, drawings of the same beings spotted within the earlier pages contained in large rooms with small cots and loads of what I can only assume was Renaissance-Age or pre-modern medical tools and objects. 

There were barely any detailing within their faces, though some looked like they were in pain. Some doubled over and drawn vomiting something colored in red.  
  
The next page showed doctors working on a patient. The person..who is male due to his crotch being shown, was deathly skinny. His skeletal structure was practically visible with his skin..or the patches that he had left acting like a thin blanket to keep everything together. One of his limbs was drastically longer than the other. It was like the bone itself snapped, separated under all of their muscle and skin and connected back together to create a much longer version of itself. 

None of the words made sense, I couldn’t understand a word of what was being written but I could understand one thing. It spoke of a disease…a plague.  
  
The next few pages were almost the same thing, doctors standing over different patients of different ages all experiencing varying symptoms. Things such as vomiting, aggression, extreme fear and isolation, sensitivity to light, and a bunch of other stuff I couldn’t understand.  
  
Whatever the hell was happening, it was bizarre. There wasn’t a chance in hell that this stuff was even real…let alone plausible. In what world is there beings with horns and tails and digitigrade legs?  
  
It was a load of bullshit in my eyes, a fake journal to scare kids. But there was this itch at the very back of my head that told me that I still needed to send it over. To understand what it was saying. Even if it didnt benefit the case whatsoever, I needed to know.  
\_\_\_\_

Only a week had gone by after that. The contents of that book still itched at my head like a parasite, whispering the ideals and the sheer possibilities of what that journal could say. 

The town was starting to get even more antsy than ever before. The body count was now up to 12, and the department started to set up curfews and restriction zones in the forests. Many citizens were angry about some of their trails being closed down or started to suspect the outcasts of being “The Forest Cannibal” as they dubbed the killer.  
  
The sheriff decided to hold a town meeting in order to try and get everyone in line..after an incident involving a local man assaulting a homeless man because he “looked suspicious.”  
  
“Right. As everyone knows, many have lost their lives within the boundaries of the forest to an unknown person. It’s caused a lot of heartbreak and…mistrust within this community.” Sheriff Smith-Marron started. “But during these times.. there have many of you that have acted completely out of line!”  
  
He sounded like he was scolding children instead of a room of 4 dozen grown men and women…some older than him. Frankly it was quite disappointing to see various grown men and women argue in the way of capturing the suspected killer and bringing him to justice…by beating on a homeless man who frankly couldn’t harm a soul. Paranoia and the climbing suspense of these killings had drawn the townspeople to try and enact some sort of revenge on those they deem suspicious enough.  
  
As the sheriff kept talking, a woman burst into the hall, tears and sweat rolling down her face.  
  
“***My babies! Please you must find them!*****”**  
  
She shrieked frantically, causing everyone to turn and look at her with pity, fear and confusion.  
  
“Mrs. Demitri, what-“  
  
“***My sons! They went into the restricted zone closest to the neighborhood with some of their friends!! I have no idea where they could have went!”***  
  
Silence. The sheriffs face twisted into horror as some of the officers stood up. It was only a small bunch of us. A small group of deputies that I can’t remember the names of, me and Miller, Captain Overnthall, Chief Deputy Franklin and the sheriff himself…there were plenty of us to handle what we had assumed as a singular man.  
  
“Deputies stay here and make sure *no one* leaves this building. Everyone else come with me.” His voice was as steady as it could, a mix of panic rising within his voice as he grabbed his coat and ran out the doors.  
  
The shouts of the rest of the people within the hall died down as all of us ran outside and jumped into our cars. The sheriff was the fastest out of all of us, basically peeling out of the dingy parking lot before any of us stepped foot in our own vehicles.   
\_\_\_\_

Wind whistled past my ears as the group of officers surrounding me called out frantically. The flashlights we had on us were mediocre at best.. but in the deep darkness that ate everything it touched, it was a sign.  
  
The sheriff’s voice was the loudest out of all of us. His eyes wild and panicked as he tried to make as much noise as possible to see if any of the kids would be able to hear us. I was confused as to why he was like this. As much as we did stuff like finding children he never seemed to be this messed up about it. But looking now I realized that his own son was with that group on that night as well.  
  
A sudden scream west of us caught our attention, leading us to a smaller clearing within the forest itself.  
  
The scream came from one of the boys…no older than 11 years old. His arm was broken as he laid in the grass…rolling in pain and holding his arm as the blood soaked through his small blue jacket. He wailed that there was something huge that chased after the group, and he was the only one that got separated after he fell. Poor kid was a sobbing mess…but he seemed to be lucky considering what would happen to some of his friends 

Miller stayed back with him as we continued forward. The sounds of shouting and what I thought were tree branches snapping became clearer as we approached that…thing.  
  
I must mention this before I continue.. but I really unsure of how I did it. At one point I turned on my body camera that I had just put on and set up properly before the meeting. It must have been during the struggle of getting out of the car and into the forest itself. If it wasn’t for that I don’t think I would have even able to piece together what I know now.  
  
What greeted us when we reached that group was nothing that can compare to any horrifying experience I’ve ever had in my life. Nothing can and will be able to change that.  
  
The boys were all scattered around the forest floor. Some injured with broken limbs and others bleeding from their heads. All of them were fully alert and looking at the creature in abject horror. One stood as tall as he could, waving a stick at the being while the other dangled loosely from its grip. And that thing. Jesus.  
  
It was tall, almost 9 feet if I were to guess. Digitigrade legs that barely held itself up stood tall…patches of what I assumed was fur clung onto the last bits of skin around its legs. Its skin was a deep red, with flecks of flesh and muscle sinew jutting out from the various open wounds on its body. And it wasn’t like it was a lot of muscle either…that beast was almost skin and bone. Its chest didn’t even have skin on it… showing an odd looking ribcage with a still beating heart.. lungs that slowly pulsed and the remaining of what I can only assume were its organs. All of it seemed like it was rotting away, and it smelled like it to. The putrid stench of a body that was floating in water for days on end penetrated the noses of everyone that came close enough. I could hear officers gagging as they covered their noses the best they could while hoisting their guns.  
  
I didnt get to see its face until it looked down at us. It looked terrified. Terrified as if it wasn’t holding the unconscious body of a middle schooler and terrified as if it didn’t know what it was doing. Its featured were..confusing. I can’t tell if it’s from my memory actively blocking out the moment or if it was simply like that in the first place. But it face was sunken in. Its teeth were sharp and stained red and yellow from blood and simply rot. And its eyes. They were a dull purple, the misery and pain etched into each and every inch of its eyes as it looked at us, slowly moving a long, clawed hand over its eyes.

Then it spoke.  
  
“*Quaeso, miserere.”*  
  
A rough, raspy voice spoke. It sort of sounded like a kid speaking when it was in trouble. Its head low and body cowering.  
  
“Drop the body! Now!!” The sheriff shouted as he pointed his gun at the creature. “Step away from the children!”  
  
“*Tam esurio...*”

The creature looked at the child in its hands. The kids right forearm was missing. A chunk of the body was missing. It dropped the boy, backing away from us. The other boy ran to his friend, frantically wrapping his arm with a sweater.  
  
“*Neminem alium laedere volo. Venter meus putrescit... sed fames perseverat..*”

It continued to speak, backing away from the lights that shined on its face. It cowered in fear, its wide eyes flickered between all of us.  
  
“Don’t move!”  
  
“Stay down!”  
  
“Keep your hands where they are!”  
  
The sheriff and officers kept shouting. All of their voices turned into a sea of words as the creature slowly stepped further and further away from the group.

“*Quaeso, noli me laedere…..*”  
  
Snap. A branch underneath the creatures foot broke, causing one of the officers close to me to fire a shot into the creatures shoulder. The wail of pain that it let out was something beyond loud. It was like a cross from a human scream and an inhuman bellow. The creature soon ran off. The thumping of its feet echoed throughout the forest as it fled. The stench of rot followed it as it vanished into the night.  
  
Silence followed. The small wheeze of one of the children snapped the rest of us back into reality.  
\_\_\_\_

It was only the day after that I realized that I had the footage. I sent off a copy to the same linguist in order to translate it. And during that time I realized something.  
  
That creature had the same exact features I saw in the book. I couldn’t just go into the station then and look at it again but from everything that I remember, it was almost exactly like a reference image given in one of the starting chapter of the book. And that same way of it looked so….sickly..it was just like the images shown in the second chapter.  
  
I couldn’t stop thinking about that imagery… so in a moment of weakness and curiosity I took the book back with me. It’s not like they’re gonna need it anyway.  


I was looking more into the pictures when I finally got the translations back along with the video. And I’m really not sure if I should share this with the rest of the station. Let alone anyone else in the town.  
  
We told the public that it was a mutated animal that fled and we are actively looking for it to put it down for good. The boys themselves haven’t said anything, since they’ve still been in the hospital being treated for their wounds. I doubt that they’ll even speak about this beyond anyone else…and if they did I doubt they’ll be believed.  
  
But for what I found in the books, I don’t think I believe it myself.  
  
It speaks about the bone structure of what they called “The Demonlios Species.” The first part of the book goes into detail about the bodies structure, the way different ‘sins’ have differing body types, horn types, and tail types. I still thought it was a giant crock of shit to be honest. There wasn’t a single change in hell that it was real.  
  
But I then got to the section about the disease.  


It spoke about a plauge that swept through the lands. Each subgroup experienced different symptoms and varying ways of how the infection took hold based on what they guessed were genetic differences.  
  
The first sign of infection all around was severe vomiting and nausea, tremors, fear or aggression, and sensitivity to many lights and sounds. Very rarely did the infection reach the bloodstream, causing what I can only assume is sepsis and take hold of the body. A vast majority of the time, it attacked what Im still assuming is the endocrine system. After a significant amount of time, the body will grow and distort before basically dying with the brain and heart still functioning.. causing the afflicted to either mutate or die.  
  
If I were to even believe this, this means that whatever…or whoever is out there in the forest is one of those beings.  
  
God I cant even imagine how it’s feeling. Imagine your entire body rotting around you. You can’t do a thing to stop it unless you either die or just mutate further enough to the point you don’t even know what you’re doing.  
  
And not to mention that it knew. It knew that something had happened to it. It begged for us to stop. Dear god.  
  
I remember watching the video translated and feeling the sensation of bile reach my throat.  
  
“*Please, have mercy*”  
  
“*I’m so hungry…*”  
  
“*I don't want to hurt anyone else. My stomach is rotting... but the hunger persists.*”  
  
“*Please, don't hurt me…..*”  
  
Those words make me feel ill. Like I aimed a gun at some poor helpless soul that couldn’t help being what it was. But the main thing that concerns me is…if that thing was real. Where did it come from? How the fuck did it even get here? Is that a demon? Is Hell real?  
  
I don’t know. I have a migraine from all of this hitting me at once. If there’s anyone that might be able to help me..please say something. I can’t bear to be the only one to know this in this town. Everyone is acting like it’s completely fine, and I know it won’t be when the next incident happens.  
  
 I just need someone to talk to about this.
