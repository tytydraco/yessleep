I know because he told me.

Not right away. Not at the beginning. He waited until my body had already betrayed me enough that I understood what he meant.

I was on the floor when it started. Cold concrete. Damp. The kind of cold that crawls up your spine and settles between vertebrae. My cheek was pressed against it hard enough that my teeth buzzed. I remember that specifically — the vibration in my jaw every time my heart kicked.

He knelt beside me like he was checking a tire.

I could smell him. Soap. Rust. Something sour underneath, like old pennies kept in a mouth too long.

“You’re still very awake,” he said.

I tried to move my arms. They didn’t listen. That was the first panic spike — the moment where your brain shouts orders and your body just… ignores them. Like the connection cable had been quietly unplugged.

He tested me.

That’s the only word that fits. Little pressures. Adjustments. A fingertip pressed somewhere it shouldn’t have been, watching how my breath stuttered in response. He learned me in real time. I felt catalogued.

When the pain started, it wasn’t sharp. It was deep. Heavy. Like my body was being filled with something hot and wrong and my skin didn’t have enough room to contain it. I screamed until my throat gave up and then I just made air noises that embarrassed me even while I was dying.

He didn’t rush.

That’s what broke me.

He took his time in the way people do when they’re enjoying a process they’ve perfected. Every movement had intention. He avoided ending anything too soon. Redirected when my body started to shut doors he wasn’t ready to close yet.

At some point I felt something warm pooling beneath me and realized with a detached kind of horror that it was me. That my body was leaking itself onto the floor in a way that couldn’t be put back.

I remember the sound. A soft, wet spreading noise every time I shifted without meaning to.

My vision did that thing where it pulses in and out, like someone dimming a light over and over. In the bright moments, I could see his face better.

He was smiling.

Not wide. Not manic. Just satisfied. Like he’d reached the part of a song he really liked.

“You’re doing great,” he said, as if this was a test I was passing.

I felt things separate inside me. Not ripping — more like sliding, rearranging, being made incorrect. The pain sharpened then, enough that my body tried to arch even though it couldn’t. My spine burned. My hands curled into shapes I didn’t choose.

I begged. Quietly. Loudly. I begged with words and then without them. When that stopped working, I just cried. Big, ugly sobs that shook whatever was left of me.

That annoyed him.

“Stay with me,” he said, pressing down harder. “Don’t go yet.”

That’s when I realized he didn’t want me unconscious.

He wanted me present.

The pain stopped being the worst part. The worst part was awareness — the sense that my body was being reduced piece by piece while my mind stayed stubbornly intact, forced to watch the inventory dwindle.

I could feel my heartbeat slow. Then stutter. Then struggle like it was pushing through syrup.

My mouth tasted like copper and bile and something rotten.

When it finally ended, it wasn’t dramatic. No final scream. No cinematic moment. Just a sudden, overwhelming heaviness and the sense of being… set down. Finished with.

—

I watched everything after.

My body looked smaller without me in it. Wrongly shaped. Like a mannequin that had been bent too many times. They covered what they could. Cleaned what they couldn’t.

He came to the funeral.

He stood close enough to see the work he’d done reflected in people’s faces. He looked calm. Proud, even. He stayed until the end.

Then he left.

I didn’t follow him.

I didn’t need to.

He took the part of me that mattered most — the memory of what it felt like to be dismantled slowly, carefully, lovingly — and he carries that now.

That’s his souvenir.

If you’re reading this and your stomach feels tight, good. That means your body still listens to you.

Mine listened too.

Just not long enough.
