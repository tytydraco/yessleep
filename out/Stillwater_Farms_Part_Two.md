***— Day 2 —***

I woke before the light reached the curtains. For a moment, I didn’t move, just stared at the chair still braced under the door handle, the way we’d left it last night. The sight alone pulled a ripple through my chest. The room felt smaller somehow, like it had been listening to us breathe.

El was asleep beside me, face turned toward the window, hair half-hidden under the quilt. She looked peaceful, maybe even happy, and that alone was enough to pull me back from the edge.

Whatever happened last night—it didn’t belong to her. I wasn’t going to let it.

I slid out of bed and stood by the chair for a long moment, my hand resting on its back, before I lifted it gently away from the door and set it against the wall like it was never there.

The air smelled faintly of rain and something sweet, like hay left too long in a warm barn. My chest loosened. A day could still be normal if I decided it would be.

Then came the sound of a bell from the main house: clear, distant, and sure of itself.

A knock followed almost immediately.

“Rise and shine!” Nick’s voice carried through the door, full of too much energy for morning. “Breakfast time, before they feed the chickens better than us!”

Hailey’s voice came next, muffled by laughter. “They probably already do.”

El stirred beside me, groaning softly. “Already?” she murmured, half-buried under the blanket.

“Yeah,” I said. “Bell means business.”

She smiled, eyes still closed. “Five minutes.”

I let her have ten.

We got dressed and stepped out into the crisp morning air. The sky was the color of wet paper, and the yard smelled fresh and quiet, like the night had rinsed it clean.

The kitchen felt alive when we entered.

Mae was already moving between the stove and the table, her apron tied neat, a strand of gray hair loose against her temple. Jonah was pouring coffee into mismatched mugs, and Clara sat at the table swinging her legs, humming something too gentle to be a tune. Ruth leaned by the window, arms crossed, watching the clouds with the face of someone who already knew the forecast.

“Morning, loves,” Mae said when she saw us. “Sleep treat you kindly?”

El smiled. “Mostly, yeah.”

Nick clapped me on the shoulder as we sat. “He had a rougher time. Heard something scratching around last night.”

I gave him a look. “Not scratching—breathing. There was—” I stopped when I saw Mae watching, curious but not surprised.

“The old house plays tricks,” she said easily. “Wood contracts at night. Sounds like sighing, sometimes.”

Jonah grinned. “Last week I woke up certain someone was trying to dig under the floorboards. Turned out to be the wind and a bad dream.”

Ruth didn’t turn from the window. “That’s the land settling. Happens every spring.”

Nick laughed. “See, Al? Science.”

El brushed my arm under the table, like saying *see, it’s fine.*

The table was laid with biscuits and jam, scrambled eggs, coffee dark enough to count as courage. Clara poured honey into her oatmeal like she’d done it every morning for a century. Everyone talked in small circles: Mae asking about the rooms, Jonah teasing Clara about sneaking sugar, Nick exaggerating our city lives to make them sound impressive.

I watched them all, waiting for someone to flinch—for some sign that the house hadn’t just been creaking. But the morning kept moving forward. The coffee was warm, the sunlight filled the window, and for a brief stretch of time, I believed maybe it really had been nothing.

Mae set down her mug. “Ruth’ll be taking you after breakfast,” she said. “Best to get hands in the dirt before the day gets too warm.”

Ruth nodded, still looking out the window. “Ground’s soft today. We’ll make good progress.”

El looked at me, smiling. “Sounds fun.”

“Depends what we’re planting,” I said, half-joking.

“Tomatoes,” Ruth answered without turning. “They like softer hands.”

\*\*\*

The fields glistened like the morning had just been poured over them. Dew clung to the weeds and fence posts, flashing white when the sun finally cleared the trees. Ruth led us past the tool shed and down toward the lower garden: a long slope of dark soil lined with crooked rows.

She walked ahead with that steady gait of someone who’d been doing the same route her entire life.

“Morning’s the best time to work,” she said over her shoulder. “The earth’s still listening.”

Hailey glanced at me, smirking. “Listening for what?”

Ruth didn’t miss a step. “For you to speak kindly.”

Nick snorted. “Ah shit, guess I better not swear then.”

“That’d be a start,” she said. 

Jonah had already gone off toward the barn, promising to send someone to help later, leaving the four of us alone with Ruth and a wagon full of tools. She handed out spades, rakes, and a few pairs of gloves that looked older than any of us.

“Pick a row,” Ruth said. “Loosen the soil, pull what’s not supposed to be there. Don’t worry about getting dirty. That’s how you know you’re doing it right.”

El immediately knelt and started working, gentle and methodical, fingertips brushing through the earth like she was searching for something delicate. Hailey crouched next to her, hesitated, then sighed and started tugging weeds with more force than accuracy. Nick, naturally, jumped into a new row, whistling as he worked. He had that kind of energy that didn’t fit the silence of the place—the kind that drew attention whether you wanted it or not.

Ruth drifted over to him after a few minutes, watching as he shoveled. “You’ve done this before,” she said.

“Something like it,” he said. “Worked a summer landscaping gig. Worst pay, best tan.”

Ruth smiled, the corner of her mouth lifting just enough. “You’ve got a good grip. But you’re doing all the work—you have to let the tool work for you.”

She stepped beside him, adjusted the way he held the shovel. Her hand rested on his forearm, light but deliberate.

“That’s better,” she said. “Now you’re helping the earth breathe.”

Hailey’s hands froze mid-motion. “Helping the earth breathe,” she repeated under her breath, pulling harder at a clump of weeds until it came up roots and all.

El noticed, tried to ease the air. “She’s just showing him form,” she said. “Ruth’s a pro.”

“Sure,” Hailey said, forcing a laugh. “Farm flirting. Totally normal.”

Ruth and Nick moved a few rows away to fix the angle of a post. I kept working, pretending not to hear Hailey start muttering to herself.

“Do you see that?” she said after a moment. “The touching, the giggling. It’s like a bad romance novel.”

El smiled, soft. “She’s twice our age, Hails.”

“Yeah, and she’s got twice the nerve.”

I looked over. Ruth was pointing at something in the soil, laughing at something Nick said, touching his arm—the sight clearly hit Hailey wrong. She threw her gloves down into the dirt.

“Okay, no, seriously. I’m saying something.”

“Hailey—” I started, but she was already walking across the rows, her boots sinking deep into the wet soil.

“Hey,” she called, voice bright and sharp. “Quick question—do you need my boyfriend’s biceps to farm tomatoes, or are we doing some kind of new workout here?”

Nick stiffened, turning toward her, shovel still in his hands. “Hails, don’t—”

Ruth straightened, calm as a statue. “You’re welcome to join us,” she said, voice level. “No need to ask permission.”

“I didn’t ask,” Hailey shot back. “I just thought maybe you were confused about who’s helping who.”

Ruth didn’t flinch. “The soil doesn’t care who’s jealous, dear,” she said. “Only who’s patient.”

The words landed like a slap disguised as advice. Hailey blinked, her face a mix of anger, confusion, and embarrassment. “Excuse me?”

Ruth turned back to her work, not even meeting her eye. “Excused.”

Hailey’s jaw tightened. “You—” she started, then stopped herself. Her chest rose like she might shout, but instead she spun around and stormed off toward the fence line.

Nick dropped the shovel and went after her, calling her name. Ruth didn’t watch them go. She just kept moving down the row, planting seeds one after another with precise, practiced care.

El and I stood there for a while, the quiet stretching between us.

“I’ll, uh… finish this one,” I said.

“Yeah,” El said softly. “Me too.”

Ruth didn’t look up as she spoke. “You two make a good pair,” she said. “Quiet hands do honest work.”

I wasn’t sure if it was meant kindly or not.

We worked in silence until the sun climbed higher, burning the dew off the soil. The rhythm of it was steady, almost hypnotic, the soft thud of dirt, the buzz of flies, the occasional distant clang from the barn. Every so often, Ruth would hum a strange half-melody. It didn’t sound happy or sad, just… practiced, like the ground expected it.

When she finally stood and brushed her hands clean, she looked toward the main house.

“That’s enough for the morning,” she said. “Lunch’ll be ready soon.”

I wiped my hands on my jeans and followed her gaze. Hailey and Nick were still standing by the fence up the property, their figures small against the field. They weren’t shouting anymore, but they weren’t touching either.

\*\*\*

By the time we got back to the main house, the air had turned heavy with heat. It clung to us, thick and sweet, carrying the smell of soil and cut grass. My shirt stuck to my back. El laughed when I tried to shake the dirt from my hands and only made it worse.

Mae was waiting on the porch with a pitcher of water and that unshakable calm she always carried, like she’d been standing there for hours just to see if we’d come back.

“You all look well-worn,” she said, smiling. “That’s a good sign. Means the land likes you.”

Ruth handed her gloves to Clara, who appeared at her side without sound. “They’ve got good hands,” Ruth said. “Quick learners.”

“Lunch is inside,” Mae said. “Eat before it cools. It’s stew today; Jonah’s recipe.”

El’s face brightened at that. “Smells amazing,” she said.

“Thank you, dear.” Mae’s eyes flicked to me for half a second. “You’re looking a bit pale. Sun catch you off guard?”

“I guess so,” I said, rubbing the back of my head. “I’ll wash up before we sit.”

She nodded once, like she already knew that would be the answer.

Inside, the dining room was dim and cool, the air thick with the scent of thyme and broth. Bowls and spoons were set neatly in a line across the long wooden table. The others were already finding their seats, but I slipped down the hallway toward the washroom, wiping my palms on my jeans.

The hallway felt longer than before, narrow, close, the boards beneath my boots creaking like they didn’t want to. A draft moved through it, carrying the faint smell of oil paint and dust. That’s when I noticed the portrait.

It hung across from the pantry door, larger than I’d realized, the varnish darkened with age. The frame was carved oak, worn smooth at the corners where fingers must’ve rested countless times.

The family.

They were all there: Mae seated at the center in a black dress, her hands folded neatly in her lap. Abel stood just behind her, his expression unreadable, eyes the same soft gray they were now. Ruth was off to the side, younger in posture but otherwise unchanged. Jonah wore a stiff suit, his mouth caught between a smile and a smirk. Silas looked barely out of boyhood, his hair slicked and his gaze sharp.

Behind them all, slightly apart, stood an older man, tall and thin, his shoulders stooped but his presence commanding. His skin was pale to the point of translucence, and his eyes, painted darker than shadow, seemed to follow from the frame itself. His hand rested on Clara’s shoulder, gentle yet possessive, as though anchoring the whole family in place.

Clara looked small and frail, the sickly pink of her cheeks painted too carefully to hide the pallor underneath. She couldn’t have been more than eight or nine in the painting. The others looked exactly as they did today. Time had moved for her, and no one else.

I leaned in, close enough to smell the varnish. The brushwork around Clara’s eyes was rougher, newer—someone had tried to fix her, to make her belong to the same moment as the rest of them. But it didn’t work. Her face looked borrowed.

The only one missing was Harlan. Though I’m sure if he were in it, they’d have to double the size of the portrait.

From the kitchen, chairs scraped against the floor. Someone laughed—Nick, by the sound of it. The normalcy of it all cut through the fog that had settled in my chest. I stepped back, nearly knocking into a small side table. My reflection wavered in the glass of the portrait: pale, uncertain, out of place.

When I rejoined the others, the conversation stumbled as I entered, then carried on like it hadn’t.

The stew was thick and rich, heavy with root vegetables. Hailey’s eyes were still red-rimmed, her smile forced, but she played along. Nick kept making jokes about fence-building like nothing had happened.

El brushed dirt from her sleeve. “I think I’m starting to like this,” she said, grinning at Mae. “It’s slower. Makes sense.”

“That’s the trick,” Mae said. “Everything here has its own pace. The land tells you when to rest.”

“Wish my foreman did that,” Nick said, earning a small laugh from everyone.

The silence that followed was thin but comfortable until Abel set his spoon down.

“Funny thing about pace,” he said, voice low but clear. “You can’t rush understanding. You can hurry your hands, but the ground—it’ll just wait for you to come back right.”

He looked around the table once, eyes settling nowhere. “Same with people.”

The table went still for a moment, caught between meaning and politeness.

Then Jonah clapped once, sharp enough to pull everyone out of it. “Well, that’s our sermon for the day. Amen to patience.”

Hailey smiled weakly. “I’ll drink to that,” she said, though her cup was empty.

Jonah chuckled. “Save it for tonight. We’ll have something to show you after supper.”

“Something?” El asked.

He winked. “A surprise.”

Mae smiled at that, her expression unreadable. “You’ll see. For now, eat up. There’s still work to be done.”

\*\*\*

The sun had settled high by the time we made it back outside. The air shimmered faintly above the dirt road, the kind of heat that buzzed more than it burned. Jonah was already waiting near the barn with a coil of rope slung over his shoulder and a hammer hanging from his belt.

“Hope you’re not all tuckered out,” he said, grinning. “Got a fence that’s been giving me attitude.”

Nick groaned, but it was good-natured. “You really know how to show your guests a good time.”

“That’s my specialty,” Jonah said, tossing him a pair of gloves. “Manual labor and bad jokes.”

We followed him down toward the lower field, where the property sloped gently toward the tree line. The fence stretched out in uneven rows, weathered gray boards held together more by stubbornness than nails. One section had splintered clean through, the rails bent inward like something heavy had pushed against it.

Jonah crouched to inspect the damage. “Old stag again,” he said. “Mean bastard’s got it in for me.”

El knelt beside him. “A stag did this?”

“That or a tractor with horns,” he said, straightening. “He’s been around longer than I’ve been alive. Big, ugly thing. Probably thinks we owe him rent.”

Nick laughed. “What, you two got a rivalry?”

“Oh, it’s personal,” Jonah said, dead serious for a beat, then smiled. “We’ll call it mutual respect.”

He passed out nails and a couple of short planks, directing each of us to a section. The work fell into rhythm quickly. Nick and Jonah hammered, El steadied posts, Hailey stacked wood, and I followed behind, clearing brush from the fence line. For a while, it almost felt like something normal: a group project, a shared task that existed for no other reason than to be done.

Hailey started to enjoy herself again once she found her groove. She was stronger than she looked, and Jonah noticed.

“Not bad with a saw,” he said. “Most people struggle to keep a straight line.”

She wiped sweat from her forehead, proud. “Guess I missed my calling.”

“Guess so,” Jonah said. “We’ll make a farmer outta you yet.”

El snorted. “She’s barely lasted without Wi-Fi.”

“Maybe,” Hailey said, smirking. “But I’ll still outwork you.”

Nick raised his hammer in mock salute. “Now there’s the woman I know.”

It was light and easy, laughter rolling down the field like wind through tall grass. For the first time since arriving, the air didn’t feel like it was hiding anything. The farm was just a farm. Work was just work.

El and I ended up near the end of the row, where the shade from the trees stretched long and cool. She nudged me with her shoulder. “You’re quiet,” she said.

“I’m working,” I said.

“Barely,” she teased, resting her chin on her arm. “You were born to supervise.”

“Someone’s got to make sure the dirt’s doing its job.”

She laughed, and it was the kind of laugh that loosened the knot behind my ribs. For a second, I forgot about last night, about the portrait, about everything except the sound of her voice.

Then, faintly, from somewhere beyond the barn, came a cry.

It wasn’t human, but it wasn’t entirely animal either—something caught between a howl and a wail, sharp enough to slice through the hum of work.

I looked up. “El,” I said quietly. “Did you hear that?”

She straightened, listening, but the sound didn’t come again. “What?”

“Something from the barn,” I said. “Like an animal in pain.”

She shrugged, still smiling, but less sure. “You get all kinds of noises on a farm. Could be anything.”

Jonah noticed me looking toward the sound. “That’s just our heifer,” he said easily. “Due any day now. When she starts hollerin’, means she’s close. Whole ordeal sounds worse than it is.”

“Ah,” I said. “Right.”

He grinned. “Trust me, son, if it was something worth worrying about, Ruth’d already be yelling.”

That seemed to settle it for everyone else. Work carried on, nails sinking into wood, the smell of sap and sweat in the heat. But I couldn’t shake the edge of that sound. It hadn’t been a cow. It had sounded… wrong.

Another cry came, shorter, lower, more like a sob than a scream.

No one else reacted.

I stood up, pretending to stretch. “I’m gonna hit the washroom,” I said.

Jonah didn’t even look up. “Don’t gotta ask for permission, we got it handled here,” he said, laughing.

“No doubt about that,” I said, shooting a wink at El.

I walked up toward the path that led back to the house, keeping my pace easy until I was out of sight. Then I turned, cutting behind the hedgerow, the sound of hammering fading until all I could hear was the slow, dragging moan of something alive and hurting.

The closer I got to the barn, the thicker the smell became: iron and straw, wet and sour. The big double doors were half open, one swaying slightly on its hinge. Inside, the air was dim and heavy.

I stopped just before the threshold, heart pushing against my ribs. A voice carried from within: light, sing-song, unmistakably Silas.

“Easy now, easy. No sense fightin’. You’re already halfway to art.”

Then a grunt: low, guttural. Harlan.

Something hit the floor with a wet sound. A blade scraped against wood.

Silas laughed softly. “See? Told you she’d stop kickin’. They always do.”

Another sound: the tearing slide of hide coming away from muscle. My stomach turned.

I inched forward, just enough to see shapes moving in the dark. Silas stood over a workbench, sleeves rolled to his elbows, hands slick with blood. Harlan loomed beside him, holding down what was left of a goat, or maybe a deer, it was hard to tell anymore. Hooks hung from the ceiling, each carrying some different kind of animal. Some were fresh, others had dried, curled edges, almost leathery.

“Clara’ll like this one,” Silas said, wiping his hands on a cloth that had once been white. “Smaller hides are her favorite. Softer to stitch.”

Harlan didn’t answer, just kept working.

Silas tilted his head, admiring his handiwork. “Almost ready for tomorrow night.”

That phrase landed hard. *Tomorrow night.*

I backed away before I could hear more. My boots whispered against the dirt, slow and careful until I reached the open air again.

When I got back to the field, everyone was still working. El waved when she saw me, smiling like nothing had changed.

“You okay?” she asked when I got close enough.

“Yeah,” I said, my throat dry. “Just—just needed a breather.”

Jonah looked up from where he was kneeling. For a second, his eyes met mine, calm, unreadable, too steady. Then he smiled.

“Alright, folks,” he said, brushing his hands together. “That’s enough for today. Go wash up, get cleaned, and put on something nice. We’ve got a bit of fun planned for tonight.”

\*\*\*

By the time the sun began to fall, the air had softened again. The heat that had pressed down all afternoon broke into a slow, golden warmth that made everything glow.

We changed in the rooms, rinsed the dirt from our arms, and stepped back outside as the bell rang again. This one was lower, slower; not the breakfast bell, not the call to work. Something different.

The whole farm seemed to hum beneath it.

Jonah met us by the main house, wearing a clean shirt and that easy grin that never quite reached his eyes. “Perfect timing,” he said. “Follow me.”

We trailed behind him up the gentle slope past the gardens until the land opened into a wide clearing. The sun hung low, a copper disc resting just above the tree line. Someone had set up long tables, unlit lanterns, and an old wooden drum near the center.

The rest of the family was already there. Ruth stood beside Mae, both barefoot in the grass. Abel leaned on his cane, face unreadable as ever. Silas and Harlan were hauling crates toward the side of the field, moving in quiet rhythm. Clara sat cross-legged on the ground, weaving flowers into what looked like a garland made of bone and twine.

“Welcome to our little tradition,” Jonah said, turning to face us. “Happens every season or so. Helps the land breathe again.”

Mae smiled, her hands folded neatly. “The Stillwater Festival,” she said softly. “You’ll see why.”

It started with a sound: the first deep hit of the drum. Jonah’s hand struck it slow and deliberate, once, then again, until it fell into a heartbeat rhythm that carried through the grass.

The others began to join. Abel clapped along, off-beat but steady. Silas lifted a carved wooden flute to his lips and played a thin, trembling note that hung over the rhythm like fog. Ruth picked up a pair of small stones and knocked them together in time, her face turned toward the setting sun.

Then Mae began to sing.

Her voice wasn’t loud, but it filled the field like smoke: low, wordless, rising and falling with the drum. The melody didn’t sound human, not exactly; it moved in strange intervals, like something ancient and remembered rather than written.

The guests—us—didn’t know what to do at first. El looked around, eyes wide, a mix of wonder and disbelief. Nick laughed quietly under his breath, but it wasn’t mocking, just nervous. Hailey squeezed his hand. Even she seemed caught by it.

Then the rhythm deepened. Jonah hit the drum harder, faster, the sound echoing off the treeline until it felt like the whole valley was shaking in heartbeats. Harlan and Clara stomped wildly with bare feet. Silas’s flute became frantic, the notes sharp and uneven. Ruth’s stones clacked faster, and Abel began to hum low in his chest, matching the pitch of the earth.

The air itself seemed to change: thicker, charged. The smell of rain came before the first drop fell.

Mae’s song grew louder, her voice breaking apart into syllables that didn’t sound like language. The family began to move, not in choreographed steps but in a raw, instinctive motion: swaying, turning, stamping. The guests followed, half-laughing, half-drawn into it.

El grabbed my hand. “Come on,” she said.

Her eyes were bright, hair already clinging to her face. I let her pull me in. We moved with them, clumsy at first, then less so. The drum beat faster. The ground seemed to answer.

The rain came hard and sudden, but no one stopped. It only made everything louder: the slap of wet feet on grass, the hiss of water hitting skin. Nick whooped, spinning Hailey in a circle until they both fell into the mud laughing. Mae threw her head back, singing into the downpour like she was summoning it. Ruth clapped along with the thunder.

And for the first time since we’d arrived, I felt something like peace. Not calm, not safety, but a wild, electric surrender.

Everyone was laughing, shouting, stomping, their voices and the drum merging into one sound that belonged to no one. The line between family and guest, host and stranger, blurred until there wasn’t one.

Then I saw him.

At the edge of the field, half-hidden by the trees, a figure stood still while everyone else moved. Tall, thin, his outline warped by the curtain of rain. He didn’t join in. He just watched.

Even from that distance, I knew it was a man. The way he held himself: rigid, rooted. The others either didn’t notice or pretended not to.

A flash of lightning lit the field, and for an instant I saw his face. Pale, long, eyes like empty sockets. Then the light was gone.

The music slowed. The rain softened. Jonah gave one last strike to the drum and stepped back, breathing hard, smiling. “That’s what I call worship,” he said, half to himself.

Laughter rippled through the field. People were drenched, exhausted, grinning. El pressed her forehead to mine, her breath warm despite the cold rain.

“This place,” she whispered, “it’s kind of magic, isn’t it?”

I smiled back, but behind her, I looked toward the trees again. The figure was gone.

Jonah approached, his hair plastered to his forehead. “Hell of a night,” he said, clapping me on the shoulder. “Sorry about the noise earlier. Didn’t want to spoil the mood.”

“The heifer?” I asked, though I already knew.

He nodded once, the kind of nod that meant nothing. “Everything’s handled. You’ll see what it was all for soon enough.”

Then he grinned again, wide and easy. “Now go on. Get dry. Tomorrow’s gonna be a big day.”

We stumbled back toward the house, drunk on wine, music, rain, and something else I couldn’t name. El laughed at nothing, her hair dripping onto my shirt. From the open fields behind us, the drum sounded one last time: a single, deep pulse that rolled through the night and faded into silence.

When we got back to the room, we were too tired to talk. El collapsed onto the bed, still smiling. “You can hear them,” she said, half-asleep. “Nick and Hailey. Sounds like they made up quickly.”

“Guess the music worked,” I said.

She laughed softly, eyes closed. “I love it here.”

I turned off the lamp. Rain whispered against the window. My body was heavy, my mind even heavier. For a while, I thought maybe I’d dream of the music, or of El dancing, or of nothing at all.

But when I woke in the middle of the night, the door was open. Just a crack.
