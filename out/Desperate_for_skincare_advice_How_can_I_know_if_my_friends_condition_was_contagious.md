I've tried asking on skincare and makeup forums ten times already, so please don't tell me to crosspost there. My questions have been removed almost instantly every time, and at this point, at least two have banned me from interacting with their subreddit entirely. The only ones I haven't tried require photos to be embedded with the post, and I don't feel comfortable with that.

I'm Frankie. Early twenties, if it matters, same as my friend Gemma. We met as early as middle school, at which point we kind of hated each other. I'd hold her facedown in the grass and shove wads of gum in her hair. She'd kick sand in my eyes and steal tampons from my backpack to hide in the boys' bathroom. We were too much alike, I guess, and we pissed each other off bad, but we always ended up around each other anyway: birthdays, pool parties, group projects, you name it. It didn't matter how much I got under her skin. We were magnetized to each other, pulled in by some cocktail of teenage girl pheromones or mutual boredom or something.

Around freshman year of high school, we formed an unspoken truce where we were willing to call each other friends, even if we still had some immature habits. I think that's normal, though. Who can honestly say they were mature at fifteen?

Puberty kicked both our asses. Gemma got perfect tits plus a face full of acne. I was flat as a board and model-tall, but my scalp was a dandruff-y mess, constantly oily and flaking. We were nice enough not to point out each other's faults most of the time.

Before going out together, we'd hang out at mine (Gemma's parents were nutjobs), and I'd let her use my makeup. Sometimes I'd apply it for her. She'd help me shellac my hair into a tight, sleek ponytail so I'd look shiny and chic instead of sweaty and stringy. She did a pretty good job, but honestly, what I liked most was the feeling of her nails on my scalp as she worked. This one time, once everything was gelled down, she gave me a congratulatory pat on the cheek and left to rummage through my bin of lipgloss.

"Fuck," she said. She'd been ensnared by her reflection, leaning close to the mirror.

"What?" I could see her fingers pressing around her jaw, exploring. Her mouth was in an angry little pout. She was swivelling her head and flexing her cheek taut to get a better look at something.

"I've got fucking Mount Doom on my face. God damn it, Frankie, is your foundation expired or something? Are you making me break out?"

It was a stupid accusation. She hadn't worn my makeup in weeks, but it was easier to blame me than admit her skin was a battlefield these days, full of lumps and caverns. I walked up behind her and rested my head on her shoulder, meeting eyes with her reflection and pulling a nasty face. "Oh, yeah. She's huge." A low blow, but I was right. Staring back at me was a swollen, white-headed pimple begging to burst. I was surprised Gemma hadn't caught it before coming over. She usually didn't have the self-confidence to walk around with one so big without slathering it in concealer first. "Just pop it. We can ice it before we go to Dustin's. No one will know."

Gemma's face twisted like a toddler about to throw a tantrum. Whininess was one of her worse traits. "I *can't*, Frankie," she held up her manicured hands, each nail topped with gel extensions way too long to do much of anything with. Her eyes went wide and glossy, pleading like a puppy. "Do it for me?"

I don't know what I was thinking. It's gross; I already know that, but I didn't even hesitate. I spun her around and pinned the thing between my thumbs, putting pressure on either side of the ripe little mound until a tiny tube of pus spewed out the top and a pinprick of blood after that. I kept pressing. I wanted to see what else would come out. I didn't stop until Gemma swatted my hands away.

Too ashamed to keep looking at the agitated, red spot I'd made, I left in a hurry to grab her an icepack and prepared for whatever verbal shaming she'd sling me with later for becoming so transfixed. Only it never came. We finished our makeup silently, swayed to shitty indie music, and went to the party.

Somehow, it became our little ritual. I don't remember who initiated it next. It was monthly, then weekly, then daily. I knew her face better than my own.

She'd lay her head in my lap after swim meets, eyes closed, breath soft and peaceful. I'd brush my thumb over her chin, cheeks, and forehead until I found a rough spot, then pick, peel, or pop it. Sometimes I could pull off an impressive sheet of dry skin, bigger than a quarter, revealing the pretty baby-pink layer underneath. Perfect and taut, just beneath the surface. Other times, she'd have me use toothpicks and tweezers to empty her clogged pores or dig out blackheads. I stole my mom's cosmetic magnifying glass once or twice to get a good look at the honeycomb-like holes neatly arranged on her nose and the minuscule maggoty growths that stuck out from them. (They're called sebaceous filaments, and they're harmless.)

If it hurt, Gemma never let on. She'd hum contentedly or gossip quietly, murmuring secrets while our faces were only a few inches apart. I got so good at it that I could carve out pimples before they even fully surfaced, massaging the skin and excavating blemishes like a pro. I'd scan for anything, big or small. I'd go until she was soft and smooth, albeit red from irritation, and we'd admire my handiwork in the mirror before going on with our day. We never spoke about our habit, barely even acknowledged it. Just slipped in and out of sessions wordlessly.

It was our special thing, just her and me, a secret only the pads of my thumbs and the hills and valleys of her face could know about.

This continued throughout high school, waxing and waning depending on our moods. It was a kind of self-soothing, or so says my therapist, but I think she's a quack, so what the fuck do I know.

My episodes with her became my favourite pastime. Still, even I could tell it was beginning to catch up with us. The flesh on Gemma's cheeks became slightly thick and leathery, padded by discoloured scar tissue. I never considered it then, but the germs under my nails probably didn't help. All the abrasions I was making likely caused more flare-ups than they fixed. She was becoming tender and sun-sensitive. Someone was sure to notice.

The thing is, the thicker and rougher skin becomes, the easier it is to peel back, letting me tug off bigger and bigger areas with painless precision. We couldn't just stop now.

Eventually, the inevitable happened. Gemma and I made a rare decision to hang out at her place while her mom was busy hosting a Tupperware party. Gemma lying in bed, me straddling her torso, hunched over and craning my neck to survey her face. Prom was coming up, and she wanted to be doll-smooth before then. I dug my nails into her face, popping a stubborn pimple and peeling up the lifted edge from the indent I'd created. It was harder to pull back than usual, stubbornly stuck on.

I jolted up when something warm wriggled beneath my thumb. The startle made me yank way too hard, making Gemma buckle and yowl beneath me. I covered her mouth whipcrack fast, but it was too late. Her mom busted in, horrified, and dragged me out for "mutilating her baby girl." Whatever.

We didn't talk much after that.

Gemma was evasive in class. There was a raw, pinkish strike across the right side of her face from where I'd dug too deep. We orbited each other, but the shared shame ran too deep to do much else. Gemma's mom blocked my number from her phone, and when prom came, we got ready alone. She never looked at me on the dancefloor. Our friendship fizzled out along with our filthy little secret, and that was the end of that.

Years passed. We went to colleges on opposite ends of the province. We were still friends on Facebook, occasionally exchanging bland comments on each other's status updates. Nothing of substance. Just, "Happy spring!" and "Yep, brunch is the best!" Stupid, petty shit.

She got a boring boyfriend and an impressive degree. I dropped out and got a cat.

A week ago, though, she messaged me.

* **\[17:20\] Gemma: Hii<3** 
* **\[17:20\] Gemma: Watcha up to?**

I didn't reply. I don't know why. Seeing her messages made me feel nauseous.

I imagined a fruitworm dangling out of her nostril.

* **\[23:01\] Gemma: Dustin broke up with me btw**   
**\[23:02\] Gemma: Im in your area, want to grab coffee?**   
**\[23:30\] Gemma: I miss u**   
**\[01:13\] Gemma: Come to my hotelllll:) We can raid room service lol**

It's shitty, but I'll be honest. The promise of free, hot food was huge for me. I'd been sustaining myself off of PB&J and frozen veggies for a week, so, fuck it, right? I was a beauty school dropout, and there are worse reasons to meet up with my estranged best friend than a decent dinner a quick bus ride from my place.

Obviously, I regret it. I regret a lot of things. I regret hurting you, Gemma, but I can't take that back now.

We met at the bar attached to the foyer of her hotel in the latter part of the afternoon. I wanted the sun to be out. We spent so much time as teenagers tangled up in the darkness of our rooms; I needed the clarity of daytime to feel normal about all of this. Plus, I wanted a good look at how her face had healed. If that gash had filled in nicely, I'd feel less bad aboutâ€¦ everything. Maybe then we could carry on and grow up for real this time.

Gemma was waiting for me when I arrived. She'd gotten much better at makeup since I'd seen her last. Although I could still make out faint bumps indicative of adult acne, her foundation was creamy and perfectly matched her natural complexion. Her liner and brows were thick and dark, bold enough to distract the average person from the uneven texture beneath it all. Me, though? I saw through all of it. We could never hide from each other, her and I.

I blinked and realized she was looking at me expectantly.

"What?" I said.

"I said *I miss you*, stupid."

"Right," I wasn't feeling talkative. I didn't want her too close to me. I couldn't shake the feeling that she was contagious. After all, one bad apple spoils the bunch.

"Rightâ€¦" Gemma rolled her eyes, then locked onto something on the table. I looked down, realizing she'd caught me picking lint from the tablecloth. I'd never been able to drop that habit. I was always looking for something to fiddle with. I hid my hands in my lap. "You don't have to be embarrassed," she crooned, "I'm nervous too. After that lashing my mom gave you, I figure you're pretty pissed at me."

"That was years ago."

"And? We haven't talked since. We used to be together all the time. Like, *all the time*. I know what your sweat tastes like."

I grimaced. "That's fucking gross, Gemma. Jesus. Is that why you messaged me? To talk about, what, sweat and snot and whatever? I thought your boyfriend dumped you. You must be having a hard time. How'd that story go."

I was being bitchy. I could feel it, but I couldn't stop myself. I was regressing into the type of person I was before her: someone who needed to prove myself, to snap and bite to be the toughest dog at the pound. I didn't want to be vulnerable with her again. It reminded me too much of messy, oozing things. I felt like I was full of something wet and slimy. I was no better than a slug.

She didn't flinch at my jab.

"I told you already, Frankie. I miss you. I never did find another friend like you."

"Someone willing to smell your musty coffee breath?"

"I drink tea. You know that. Shut up."

I noticed something I hadn't before. Gemma's nails, usually manicured and pristine, were nubby and uneven. Her cuticles were dry and flaking, with a couple of brown-red scab spots around their perimeter. My eyes narrowed. "Gemma," I said, firmer now. Deathly serious, or trying to be. "Honestly, what's going on? Why're you here, in this city, this hotel? You show up out of theâ€”"

"I want you to do it again."

Her eyes were piercingâ€”huge, awful things. I'd never noticed how big they were until now. My tongue felt fat in my mouth. She trapped my hands between her wiry fingers, caging them together. She pinned me in place with her stare.

"I mean it," she continued, "There's this tingling. Or an itch. I tried to scrape it out like you did." I remembered her nubby nails. I thought about larvae. I thought about pupation. "I can't. It doesn't work; it never works, Frankie. I can feel it in all of my pores, like, seeping out, or, fuck, I don't know. You always used to fix it."

I'd ripped my hands from hers and hauled my purse over my shoulder before she could finish. I was halfway to getting out of this awful conversation, this shitty bar, and feeling some fresh air on my face when her pleading got even more desperate. "I'll pay you," she shouted. "A lot. I have the cash. Just do it once."

If I were a better person, there wouldn't be anything else to say. I would have gone home, slept hard, and blocked her contact for mentioning any of that so casually as if scraping her face open was a normal way for girls to bond. I would have buried this whole thing and curled up in the sad, safe life I made for myself, and I'd ignore messy high school friends like a normal adult.

Gemma showed me the cash, though, and I learned my resolve is a lot flimsier than I wanted it to be.

So I did it. Well past sundown and after several drinks on Gemma's tab, I was in her hotel room, straddling her abdomen like I had all those years ago. The lights were dim, except for the lamp, which she positioned like an ungodly spotlight on her face. She'd spent half an hour in the bathroom rubbing herself raw to remove her makeup. I had a clean canvas and free reign over all her spots and bumps.

My hands were clammy. I was a mess. I could tell. My head was heavy from the wine, and my mouth tasted terrible.

Gemma used to close her eyes for this, fluttered shut like a movie princess. This time, they were painfully open, bloodshot around the edges. Dark like a rabbit's and so fucking eager. With her makeup gone, I could see how deep her eye bags had gotten. Her lips were chapped and flaking. She looked awful. But I could fix her.

I wish I could say that the whole event was fumbling and awkward. That I was repulsed. I wasn't, though. Not at first.

I slipped into the trance as easily as I always had, sweeping my fingers over her pretty cheeks and slim nose. I found three white-headed pimples on her cheek that I popped with ease, swiping the yellowy pus on her pillowcase for cleaners to deal with later. I scraped my nail over dead, dry skin, urging it to lift off, like separating an apple's waxy, red skin from the crisp fruit beneath. Bits lifted like teeny snowflakes, then I coaxed it enough to loosen off in long, papery strips.

I caught her eyes again. This time, she was smiling. Bubbles of saliva foamed at her mouth's corners. I looked away.

I found a swollen lump at the height of her right cheekboneâ€”a cystic pimple, I guessedâ€”and applied pressure. Her face was burning up. I pressed more and more until the tips of my thumbs went pale, the angry lump barely shifting. I hesitated, and Gemma scoffed, so I doubled down. Hard. The thing popped with a gross, bloody clot rolling out. Not pus at all.

I was about to recoil when Gemma's birdlike hand seized me in a vice grip. Her gaze was white-hot.

"Don't you dare," she hissed. "You're so close."

I could feel my heart in my throat. I swallowed hard, feeling my mouth fill with saliva. I did the breathing exercises my therapist recommended to soothe anxiety-induced nausea, which helped until I inhaled a lungful of something putrid. She stunk like rotting plums and copper.

Past the blood clot came pus. Or, that's what I thought. It was an off-white tube, only a millimetre wide but longer than expected. I pressed down, feeling Gemma's judgement searing through me, always so susceptible to her scorn. I watched in dismay as it just kept oozing out, longer and longer, coiling as it extended past her face.

Morbid curiosity set in, and I touched it.

It wasn't pus at all. It was hard, like a fishline.

Then it moved.

"What?" Gemma blurted. "What? What is it?" She pawed at her face and, with glee, or horror, I'm not sure, caught the writhing string between her fingers. She seized it and pulled. It came out like a clown's handkerchief, a foot long, then two, then three, comedically neverending. I couldn't for the life of me imagine where it was all coming from until I saw the snake-like silhouette shifting under her skin. Her smile was so gaping I could see the back of her throat, including, unfortunately, the flash of white ribbon that whipped past her uvula.

"You did it!" She cheered. I had fallen back onto my heels, scrambling to the foot end of the bed. Her face was deflating before my eyes, the youthful fullness of her cheeks emptying as that thing was pulled and pulled and pulled. Was that all she was, just skin and this? I could feel hot tears on my face, but my hands were numb. I begged her to stop.

"Why? Why? Why, Frankie? Is it too much? Are you upset? Is it too much?"

I wept. "Gemma, please. You brought your car, tell me where your keys are, I'll drive you to the hospital. I'll drive. Just stop."

She kept pulling. "Do you think I'm ugly, Frankie? *You* made me like this."

I shook my head. I cried. I don't know what I said after that, only that it came out between heaves, a small spot of orange bile wetting the duvet between my hands.

"You've always been in me, Frankie. Only you could get it out. Oh, thank God, oh my God, oh my God, I missed you. This is everything I needed. I'm going to get it out. I'm going to get it out."

The last thing I remember is the string pulling taut. Gemma looked delighted. It was bunched up like a cord in her hands, wiggling where it extended past her fists. There was nothing else to unfurl. With one brutal tug, it ripped the top layer of her skin, splitting her apart like a cicada's shed. Fat and flexing muscle glistened beneath. I left before she could strip off the rest, scared she'd slip out of her skin like pantyhose.

Why wouldn't she stop smiling?

I couldn't tell you how I got home, but I haven't left my apartment since. I've been having all my food delivered and deleted my Facebook and just about everything else.

I keep a pair of latex gloves on as often as I can. The feeling of skin-on-skin might as well be nails on a chalkboard right now. I wish I could stop sweating. If I think about it too hard, I get too aware of all of my pores; what's in them, what *isn't*. Why are people covered in so many fucking holes, God damn it. Why can't I just get clean?

I've been trying to avoid mirrors, but I'm scared.

My face hurts, and I think I'm starting to break out from the stress.
