First of all, i’m sorry for my bad english, as i don’t have english as my first language, and um trying my best.
This is a true history, believe it or not, so let’s get things started 

I (20F) lived with my parents (50F and 51M) and sister (17F) my whole childhood.
We lived in the alright part of our town, expensive houses with expensive cars, kids playing on the street on a daily basis, people passing with dogs unleashed, all of that would be considered normal at the time.

So about when i as 7 i moved with my family out of a small apartment, since my dad had win a big prize at his job, and we were ready to move to a big house. And so we did.

the house had 3 floors, (but on the blueprints only had 2, since it was common to occult one of them, so the house would be sold as legal, and the future owner would do it’s arrangements and wouldn’t have to worry about taxes per meter squared and shit.) 

on the first floor, it had a kitchen, living and dinning room (with a fireplace), bathroom, a office and a small pantry for cleaning items. 
on the second floor, 3 bedrooms and a bathroom.
on the third floor, 2 bedrooms, another office, a living room with another fireplace and another bathroom.

outside it had front and backyard, a garage for 5 cars, and 2 anexus (one for storage, and other like a man cave, with its own fridge, sink, bed and fireplace)

yes, it was big.

the house was from the 80’s, built from scratch, it had been assaulted several times before, and the previous owner just had divorced, and he was in a rush to sell it.

i fucking hated that house.
it was allways fucking cold inside. it made weird noises from everywhere, from floor cracking to window slamming, i hated it.
but most of all, i fucking hated the 3rd floor.

so fast foward 1 year into hating that place, it was summer, i was around 8y, and my parents wouldn’t put me to sleep anymore, so instead i’d go to my room at 10pm, and about 1hour later they would come to kiss me goodnight. same thing everyday. 

so this day, i went to my room by 10pm, as usual, left the door leaning, got comfy to sleep,  when i hear the hallway lamp motion sensor go on. i close my eyes and try to hold my smile and lay still so my parents think i’m asleep and kiss me on the forehead. 

i don’t hear the bedroom door opening, but instead footsteps on my wooden floor comming towards my bed.
i start giggling as i thought on the idea of my mom playing ninja comming to kiss me goodnight 

but she didn’t… and i kept waiting as i heard the footsteps contouring my bed to the side that’s away from the door (it wasn’t common that she would contourn my bed like at all), and i felt as it layed down (probably to snuggle under my bed). 
“mom? what are you doing?” i finally asked.
nobody answered.
i sprinted away from bed to downstairs to find both my parents still laying in the sofa, watching a random movie. 

well, needless to say i spent the whole week sleeping on my sisters bedroom, as i was to scared to even enter my own room.
days passed and life was normal again, but since that day i allways checked under my bed for someone (not for something like a monster, i was pretty sure it was a someone) and inside my wardrobes as well.

i had a few incidents happening as i grew older, like having my sister come to me to describe a man that she thought se saw hidden next to our fridge, under the kitchen table, or when i thought i saw someone sprinting up the stairs to the 3rd floor, or that i was 100% sure i saw foot passing by under the door crack every time we would do a movie night on the living room, i was 100% sure i was being watched while sleeping, and for some years, i would only fall asleep by exaustion, since i would shiver in fear that someone would show up there when i was in bed.
i developed a severe fear of the dark that i still have till today.

later on, i had my independence crises when i was about 14 and decided it was time to face my fears and move to the 3rd floor by myself.
i was obcessed with the new release of the sims 4, and as any bored kid, i was determined to make my house on that game. i was really good at it, and made several “real houses” in that game, but something about my real house vs my game house wouldn’t line up. 

on the 3rd floor, there was allways too much room on the bedroom next to mine, as in, there must be a hidden compartiment on that fucking room.

i went to my parents to show them this, and they would tell me it’s an optical elusion, that it was funny to think on that possibility, but unreal, and as they didn’t have the 3rd floor blueprint, i had to settle with that, but that was not good enough.

the years went by with me hearing noises coming from that room every. fucking. day.
mumbling, phones vibrating, footsteps.

i even called my dad to sleep on the carpet, as i thought he would hear the mumbling comming from the room next door, but he didn’t.
my dad slept on the floor for almost 5 days as i wouldn’t let him go nowhere till he hear the fucking mumbling next door. he never did, and i ended up giving up on trying.

i had a new idea. 

i’d lock that fucking door myself and trow away that damn key for good. no one used that bedroom anyway since the day i moved to that floor, so who cares what i do? i then proceeded to go tell my mom what i did, obviously omitting the part where i threw away the key, and she seemed ok with it, like “do as you wish to feel safe” which i found kinda unsettling, but ok

not even a week had pass and she went after the key. what the actual fuck. she said she needed some bedsheets she knew she stored away in that bedroom, and all of a sudden she needs them. 
and she got so obsessed with opening that door that she called in a fucking team to crack the lock. that made me think she was helping him or them that lived in that room. i just had locked them inside.

after the team unlocked that door, things started to get weirder, and i started to accept someone was in fact living next door to my bedroom.

by this time, i was almost 16y and had tried to talk to my parents to get other place to live, to burn the house down, to move to a smaller house, but it was useless.

i was deep in highschool now, and i started having my friends come over every now and then. they were terrified of “my floor” (i call it my floor since my parents and sister would live on the second floor)
 but something about it made it thrilling and exciting to experience, so as i talked with my friends about this weird room and all the things i heard comming from it, i had more and more friends coming over to “survive the night” and to see if they’d hear the same things i warned they would hear. 
some did, some didn’t, but things started getting weirder, as i would expect.

sometimes, as i was making dinner downstairs and some friend of mine was taking a shower on the 3rd floor, she would hear someone talking through the bathroom door, and as she thought it was me, she would shout back for me to stop messing with her, and i would hear it downstairs, her, talking shit, “alone” in the shower. 
it happened both ways.
it also happened me having a shower and her listening something heavy falling over, as in if i fell in the shower (which i never did btw) and went running upstairs to the bathroom door, asking if i was ok
or us being on my bedroom “home alone” and hear the hallway motionsensor lighting up for no reason, or the fridge opening downstairs with the house dead silent.

all of this i experienced with friends. 
fast foward to 18y, i had to take ansiolitics, since i could barely sleep properly, deeply believing that someone was living on my house, with my mom knowing.
as i got worse and needed more meds to sleep, since the mumbling would never go away, my parents started to fight more and more, which i allways thought on how much of a coincidence that could be.

they ended up divorcing when i was 18y, and my dad asked me and my sister to move out with him as my mother would do the house cleanups and sell the furniture by herself.

when the house was finally empty, i asked if i could go upstairs to my room, to kinda say my goodbyes, and she said no. that now it wasn’t time to go upstairs cus everything was clean, and she didn’t want me to make a mess out of it.
weird.

i’m 20 now, and i live with my mom on a small apartment and i’m 200% sure no one is living w us anymore. 
i was taking 12 pills a day for depression and anxiety, that came from the mess that my childhood was.

i stopped taking them on december last year, as i thought i didn’t need them anymore.
i don’t. my old house was what messed me up.

and as i was putting all of this together now, i decided to talk to my boyfriend about this, and he agrees that it would be possible for it to happen, as much creepy as it could sound like, it could be hella real.

i tried to talk w my mom about this, about how me taking meds ended their relationship, how i couldn’t sleep at night every night for 5+ years and they did nothing about it, and about how she always ditched my worries on what if someone was living with us all along, and she just stared at me the whole conversation.

she didn’t say a thing, and we never mentioned that ever since. from that day on, i was sure.
i just hope this time is different…
