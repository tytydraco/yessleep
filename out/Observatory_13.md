If you're reading this, then I'm dead. There it is. Right at the top. Jenko you slimy fuck I know you're reading this. You're not gonna get the chance to pull the trigger. 

Mom, Dad, Casey, Chris...I'm sorry. You told me not to take any contracting work once I got out of the Marines.  Since this is being sent out, I guess you were right. 

You guys always did right by me. I'm sorry I'm never gonna get a chance to return the favor. 

The following is not exactly a journal, it's more a collection of notes and anecdotes. Not the most organized, but this is important to get out. 

---------

Time sort of blends together here, one day into the next, day after day...shift after shift. It's exhausting. 

This journal should hopefully keep me sane. Maybe? Hopefully. 

I'm also just very fucking bored.  This isn't something I'm ever gonna be able to share but- maybe I'm just trying to organize my thoughts. Trying to make sense of what's happened so far

We're Observatory 13, out of...I have no idea how many. Observing what you may ask? 

I also have no real idea. It's been described to me as a rift between our reality and another, by someone with way more degrees than me. It's a massive sinkhole of sorts, emanating a soft orange glow.

 It's got a real sharp line, between it and the ground itself. Like a chunk of the earth was just sort of deleted. Or replaced. Over time the people running the observatories had built staircases and observation platforms, before finally building the observatories. They're 
essentially...imagine if someone took a space station and just slapped it onto the side of this sheer cliff face. A row of compact habitat modules, arranged jutting out  about a hundred feet from the cliff. At the center of them is Control, where the scientists watch their cameras and sensors. There's a secondary level of labs and research habs beneath that. 

If you look through the windows from Control you can kind of see Observatory 14 and Observatory 12 if you squint through the fog. There's always fog. These thick hell colored clouds that smell like moss and churned earth. 
Part of why we're here is to ensure nothing comes out of the pit. The other part is to monitor the weirdness associated with it. 

Its like radiation kind of.  An area of effect where the world gets weird. It was hard adjusting at first, but you work anywhere long enough you get to used to a places quirks. Plus the pay is really fucking good. 

Sure the walls bleed sometimes, sometimes there's an extra person in the station that wasn't there before, and occasionally you hear a voice outside desperately begging to be let in. Sometimes you have the absolute scariest moments of your entire life. 

But my mom's  house is completely paid for so it balances out.

 I'm a simple guy. 

So today, I was walking down the access stairs to the station taking my usual descent. They're rickety as hell, bolted into the rock face above a fall that would have probably taken days. If there is a bottom to the Pit at all. I was running a mental check as I walked, ensuring that I had everything.  Rifle, duffel bag, survival gear.
It's not exactly a trip I ever want to make more than I have to. The fog is bad today, it's risen higher than I've seen it before. Almost to the edge of the Pit. 

It smells different today. More...rotten. 

I descended the stairs to the airlock, stepping into the outer hatch and closing the door behind me. It sealed with a pneumatic hiss. The intercom crackled as I entered my access code. 

"Coffee is already waiting for you." A cheerful voice said. Sasha, one of our medics. She was a corpsman back in the Navy, so we tend to give each other a lot of shit. 

"You're chipper." I muttered, entering my code. 

"Another glorious day in the Observatory my dear Jarhead." She singsonged. Crews tend to stick together for ease of scheduling. The people you work with your first shift tend to be the ones you're stuck with for your entire time here. 

My crew isn't all that bad at least. There are three security officers, all ex military. A medic(Sasha), and three researchers. I finished typing in my code and the inner door swung open with a creak of bulky metal hinges. Once I got in, I sealed the inner hatch and bolted it before moving to drop my gear off in room six. That's my home when I'm on shift. Room Fives door growled and rattled at me like it always does when I walk by. The door shook heavily on its hinges like something was pounding on it. Something with a lot of weight to it. 

We uh...we don't go into Room Five. 

I heard the beat of the same KATSEYE song that Sasha has been listening to on repeat since it came out, drifting from the control room. I can sing the fucking thing verbatim, that's how many times I've heard it. 

Gnarly? I think it's called. 

It's...actually not bad. 

I had my rifle, a battered M4A1 slung across my shoulder. Our gear is all military surplus, older shit. Not always the best but we're familiar with it. It's a lot of heavy duty stuff too, gear I haven't seen since my time in the Corps. Rifles, Grenades, A couple of M240B's. We even have a Carl Gustaf stashed in the armory locker that some previous crew named "The Problem Solver". It's written in white along the barrel. 

When I got into the control room, Sasha was sitting in one of the office chairs, swiveling aimlessly as she sipped at a mug of coffee. A Bluetooth speaker on the console in front of her was blasting music. Another cup of coffee was sitting in front of my usual station by the security cameras. 

"Youuuuuu look like shit." She commented. "Like worse than usual." 

"Good to see you too." I grumbled, flipping her off. She cackled as I sat down and logged into my station. I had access to about eight cameras fixed at access points around the Observatory. 

Stairways and ladders, Doors, the roof and the descending path into the Pit. Observatory 15 and 16 are down there apparently, closer to the mouth of the rift. 

I've never seen em. I'm glad I didn't get assigned there. This place is just the right amount of weird for me and it seems like things would probably get more fucked further down. Closer to the source of the weirdness. 

The rest of the team had begun to file in as we started to go about our day.  Miller and Delario are the other two members of the security element. Miller is a massive ex Army Ranger who turns literally everything into a football metaphor. And I do mean everything.  Delario is quieter. He was a Green Beret back when he was active duty. 

He's working on a book I think? 
Real warrior poet type shit. He's always writing in this little leather bound notebook. I guess I've got no room to talk anymore though do I? 

Anyway. 

Delario and Miller showed up and we went about our day. The research team was in one of the lab compartments below the control room doing nerd shit, with the exception of Gibson who was monitoring his own station. He's a...biologist I think? I don't know.  He doesn't talk much. 

But we were doing what we normally do, arguing about nothing and killing time. 

Delario was back in his room sleeping, he drew the short stick and was going to end up on night watch later so he was trying to grab shuteye while he could. Miller was taking a turn at the camera station while Sasha and I were debating what was really on the other side of the rift at the bottom of the Pit.  We'd been going back and forth about this for six months now. 

I'm convinced that it has to be something really fucked up, like maybe an empire that wants to invade us. Why else would they arm us like this? It's gotta be aliens or something. 

Sasha is convinced it's like a no shit portal to hell. There's money riding on whatever the answer is once we figure it out. 

"You're not even religious!" I jabbed an accusatory finger at her. 

"I don't have to be. It makes sense."  Sasha said smugly, swiveling in her chair. She grinned like she had maneuvered me into a corner.  "It's science, I wouldn't expect you grunts to get it." 

"How?" 

"It's below us." She said, as if that cleared everything up. 

"What?" I asked incredulously. Even Gibson had turned around in his seat, an amused smile on his face. 


"Hell is down, Heaven is up, other dimensions are sideways. I don't make the rules Adam, decades of sci fi did." She said in the tone of a teacher explaining something to a particularly dense student. I paused, completely dumbstruck. 

"That- you're just fucking with me aren't you?" 

Sasha burst out laughing, doubling over in her seat. Absolute gremlin behavior. 

"Guys-" 


"Wait so why the fuck do you think it's hell then?"

"Well-"

"BOTH OF YOU CAN IT." Miller barked. That was his serious voice. I glanced towards him finally and saw he wasn't looking at his station. Miller's square jaw was set, the muscle there tensing and relaxing. 

He was...looking at the windows. I followed his eyeline, staring to try and make out whatever had him all twitchy. The fog was thick, drifting up in reddish clouds that made it hard to see anything. Miller stepped forward-

"There." He said. I saw it that time. A brief glimpse of Outpost 12, across the Pit from us. Their facility was an exact mirror of ours from what I knew. Their windows faced us. 

Their dark windows. Lit up by-

"Muzzle Flashes." I breathed. Sasha stood up, her face suddenly pale. 

"Fuck."
