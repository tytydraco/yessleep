Mason has lived with me for a while, but I still don’t know what he is.



I only know what he pretended to be.



My friend Dave was driving on the I-25 when he stopped at a rest stop.



The place was empty, deserted. There was no toilet paper or soap in the bathroom, satanic graffiti on the walls, and syringes lying on the bathroom floor.



As he was about to walk out the door, he heard a faint meow coming from the bathroom stall.



Then a cat crawled out of there. 



It had dark fur, yellow glowing sulphurous eyes, and ears that stretched high above its head.



It did look like a kitty, but its body was large, probably the size of a normal adult cat.



The meows were loud, and it seemed in real distress.



My friend said that he felt a strong feeling of compassion for the animal. His heart was torn apart hearing those calls.



He decided to take it home with him. Unfortunately, he has two cats, and both started acting strangely and kept their distance from the one he brought.



My cat had passed away recently, so when he asked if I’d like to take care of Mason, I agreed.



His story tugged at my heart. My last kitten was also a stray, so I happily took him in.



From the start, it was obvious there was something different about Mason.



Mason kept growing. Within a week, he was about the size of a medium dog.



The strange thing is that he barely ate any food. Most of the food in the bowls would be left half-eaten, and I rarely refilled his water dispenser.



I thought about taking him to the vet, but I had barely any money to get by, and the vet bills were so expensive. My last savings went toward caring for my previous cat.



At night, he would start meowing in strange screeches that sounded like a deer in heat.



His appearance started to change, too. The hair was getting shorter but darker, while the eyes were taking on a more rounded shape with the pupils changing to a strange red colour.



His paws were the first to start losing hair; by this time, they were almost bald. The fingers on his paws grew longer, and his claws got wider and sharper.



Was this some kind of wild animal?



One day, he scratched me so badly that I almost had to go to the ER. 



I couldn’t do it anymore. Mason started to give me the chills.



I considered taking him to an animal shelter.



Dave was coming over for dinner and some beers that night. 



He arrived early, and we sat around drinking before the lasagna finished.



“Did you notice anything strange about Mason?”



“Yeah, my cats would stay far away from him. Not even fight him, just look at him with fear. ”



“Also, the way I found him. I told you how weird the bathrooms looked, right?”



“Yeah, all the satanic graffiti and stuff.”



“Yep, well, I went to the stall, and when I walked out, I heard Mason meow. Then he crawled from under the stall.”



“It was dark inside, but I’m pretty sure I would see a cat. Especially one like him, he was pretty big for a kitten.”



I felt hair on my arms rise.



“Why are you asking?” Dave said.



“Something's off about him.  He’s been growing like crazy, his fur is starting to fall off, and his eyes have been turning into strange shapes. Plus, he’s been making these awful sounds the past few nights.”



“I wanted to show him to you, but I don’t know where…”



Then the strange shrieks came out of the bathroom again. This time, they were much louder than before, rambling through the whole house. They didn’t sound like an animal anymore. 



They had turned into ear-piercing, inhumane, low-pitched screams. Nothing alive should sound like that.



Dave and I jumped in our seats.



Dave stared at me with a look of bewilderment.



Then loud footsteps echoed through the hall. The house was shaking with each step. The smell of copper filled the air.



A wave of cold shot through my spine, blurring my vision.



Dave’s eyes were open wide with terror.



I quickly got up from my stool. My hands shakily searched for a knife in the drawer. When I looked up, Mason, or whatever he turned into, stood in the door.



He was now about 6 feet 4, standing on his back two legs, his hair was all gone, and pink skin shone under the kitchen lights. His paws were deformed into something between an animal's and a human's hand with sharp, wide claws.



The ears were long and hung over his head. His eyes were yellow with red pupils at their centers.



Mason let out another screech, and two rows of sharp teeth showed. His jaw started to extend.



My whole body was shaking. I held the knife close to my chest, frozen in fear. 



Dave got off the chair and started backing up.



Mason’s eyes bulged out of their sockets and stared down at Dave.



Before Dave could turn and run, Mason jumped at him and pinned him to the ground.



He then started clawing at his body and face.



Dave was screaming at the top of his lungs like a little child.



I hesitated. 



Blood was rushing through my still, frozen body. 



I knew I had to act. I began stabbing Mason, but he didn’t flinch.



He kept clawing at my friend, tearing him apart until Dave went silent.



Mason then started eating his remains, purring with every bite.



The whole world was a blur, my stomach got nauseous.



Then I heard the sounds of bone breaking and blood slurping.



I stumbled into the hall and threw up on the floor.



This awoke Mason from his feast. He looked my way and hissed at me.



I immediately ran towards the door into the dark and knocked on my neighbour's door.



The knife was still in my hand, and my clothes had Dave’s blood all over them.



The neighbors called the police. When they arrived, I tried to warn them of what they would find inside.



I walked out to the street and stared at my door, fearing what they might let out, but when the door opened, only a cute small Mason walked out.



My hands started shaking, and the whole world began to spin out of control. 



I quickly ran behind my neighbour's house and started writing this post.



Mason is sitting by the window. Smiling.



He flashed his creature teeth and ran off.



The police are coming up the driveway now, calling my name. They think it was me.



I have to get away as soon as possible.



Edit: I’m hiding in the woods now.



Mason is out here somewhere, and he knows I ran.



The trees are starting to shake, and his screeches are echoing through the forest.
