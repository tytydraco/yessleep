Within a blink, I was there, and my vision was distorted at first.


I was in a room. A bedroom. Unfamiliar and frightening. The floorboards creeked with terrifying effect. 


The room was practically empty, barring the old and rusted bed with the heavily soiled mattress on top. Maybe it wasn't rust...maybe it was, blood?...One thing's for sure, this room was designed for nightmares.


There was just one window and one door. I pushed down on the handle and rattled back and forth.


*Damnit. Locked.*


"We have to find a key." Said a familiar voice from the corner of the room. "Start looking."


It was my friend, Tony, who was now kneeling on the dust-filled floor and frantically searching under the bed. 


"An-Anything?" I asked.


"Errm...No...No, there's nothing here." He stood back up and looked around. He knew this place better than I did. 


"But, you've been here before, right?" I asked.


"Yeah, but it changes place everytime, so I never know where to look. So, you need to help me, ya know, before we run out of time and they show up."


"Shit, sorry. It's just, it's a lot creepier than I imagined."


"Yeah, yeah, yeah, just come on. Find the key."


We ripped up floorboards until our fingers seemed to bleed, and we tore away at the mattress until there was nothing but shreads. But...nothing.


"Okay...the last place to try," Said Tony, "is the window...but, its dangerous."


"Why?"


"It allows them to get in the house faster."


"How much faster?"


"...Immediately."


I walked quite briskly towards the window.


"Dude, wait, we're not prepared yet."


I was at the window staring out. My fingers lightly resting on the latch. "I...I think...I think I can see them...Shit! Oh shit! Dude, dude, I can see them! They're coming!" In my frantic moment, I accidently knocked the window latch, causing it to fly wide open. 


*TING!*


A small metal object dropped to the floor between my feet.


"The key!" I shouted.


"Yes! Come on, quick!" Tony shouted back. "We need to get downstairs!"


I could hear them bashing down the doors as I put the key in the lock. I could hear them breaking windows and scuttling around the house.


*CLUNK*


The door finally unlocked...We could hear them coming up the stairs, and Tony gulped hard.


"It's too late...They're here."


There was a moment of silence before they burst through the door. There were hundreds of them; A constant stream of the undead, all with melted skin and a strong taste for human flesh.


They got Tony instantly. His blood splattered and sprayed across the room with every bite. When they'd finished, his body disappeared, and the diseased undead were now all facing me.


Trapped in the corner of the room, with no weapons and no Tony, I took the easy way out...I pressed the button and took off my headset...


"What the hell, dude!" Said Tony, who was sat next to me on the couch. "Okay, lets go again, but this time, don't pussy out and exit the game!"
