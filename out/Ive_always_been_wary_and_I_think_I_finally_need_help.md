No matter what emotional state I’ve been in I’ve always seen the world for what it was. My ears have pricked at the slightest sound of someone following me. My eyebrows have always raised at the slightest sense of bullshit.

I’ve been trying to make my way honestly. I could bamboozle a bunch of people who have the slightest inkling that they need to see a psychic *now,* and I could have told them anything they wanted to hear, but instead, here I am, telling you that I’m no more intuitive than the rest.

I live my life hoping for the best. I hope I win mega millions tonight so I don’t have to worry about a thing. I hope that world peace happens so the current wars cease to exist. Most of all, I just wish that the world could slow down around me for one darn moment and I could catch my breath. Maybe if I did my husband could stop resenting me for my wine filled evenings, regardless of how I take care of our son. 

I don’t feel like my life is mine anymore. I haven’t for awhile. The moment I conceived a baby my life and my body became “theirs.” I was lucky. “They” were not my mother in law. “They” were not even my own mother. But they were, indeed, everyone else. Everyone who has ever had a single thought, opinion, or slight *feeling* about how to raise a child has come out of the woodwork and crawled up my ass.

I would be mad… but at the same time I need help. All I want is for my son to grow up in the world, the same way I did, and see him enjoy his life. But I have very little hope that a nice, quiet, peaceful life is what’s in store for him. I came here not just to get help but to warn you too; we don’t have much time left. I can’t tell you how I know that, but I know it well enough to assure you that your days are numbered and your happiness is finite.

I know that you know I’m here. I know I haven’t been forgotten. But I’ve lost hope that my son and I will ever be found, let alone liberated. If any of you can help, I beg you to get us out of this hole. To give him a future. I can’t do it on my own.

Trust me, I’ve tried. But he was born into a strange group. I don’t want him to perpetuate their teachings, and I don’t want to be the reason he’s stuck here. I would do anything I can to make sure that my baby escapes, even if I can’t. 

I hear his father now, coming down the stairs. I’m prepared as I always am, and he trusts me, which is why I can even reach you in the first place. But this will be the only time I can get a message out. Please; for the sake of my son, share my story. Without you we really don’t stand a chance.
