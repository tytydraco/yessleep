I always had trouble waking up not because I like sleeping but because well my changes each time I would wake up not all that much at first it started little bit by bit at the start.however it gotten worse over time.My dreams consist of random moments in my life.at first it was just small changes placements of thing and names.Then things we never owned  started appearing out of nowhere.It’s kind of random at least by what I can till.sometimes it old kid toy the kind you would see in history books,shoes,

.

I don’t know how it started.One I was younger I didn’t dream at all.Sleep was so much simpler.My eyes would close well I’d welcome the darkness enclosed around me.Only to open my eyes to the sound of my alarm.Find hours had past druggie and just as tired as before.I was up haven to make my way through another day.I heated it back then.It was great.I remember the aching in my back feeling dreadful hoping next time I ‘d never wake up again. God what I would do to get that back.Just silence no worries, being able to easily open my eyes.No worries that the world around me haven changed whence I wake up.No feeling of pressure growing each time my eyes begin to shut.



I try not to sleep. My record is one hundred and eight hours and forty five minutes.You can stay awake forever I’ve tried.Many..Many times in the end the sandman always wins.



I still remember my life from before I begin my family.My mother and father worked respectable jobs back then.They were so kind and loven.Dad was a store manager and mom was a nurse.They wear the ones I always came to.They wear the first ones I told about what was going on back one the changes was small and nothing.I don’t know what they are now or witch of them even exist if ether one does.



The changes in my dreams happened again. I don't know whatever new world I just woke up to.



Not always are the changes bad. At the beginning it was great.Ever have a dream you were richer then you are.Maybe you can fly just like the superheroes you’ve read about as a kid.perhaps you meet the love of your life.Change isn’t always bad.I’ve been through all of these and more.



At the beginning there was confusion, everything written off as coincidence.My memory must be off, it was always like that.That was always their name.That was the first three months the next couldn’t be written off.Ever go from a one bedroom  one bath house to a four bedroom two bath three kitchen?Not really something you can just say “oh I must be forgetting it’s always been like that”.



Once I accepted what was happening I tried to control it.Use it for my own needs.speakers and headphones to play voice recording books and videos on Lucid dreaming.Tied a bright rainbow string around my hand.I’d listen to a recording of me telling myself to imagine a suitcase filled with money at the foot of my bed.It took about two week but I had the hang of it.I’d see not string around my arm.My sub conscious would hear the word repeating and use my suggestions.It worked I had the time of my life what ever I wanted was mine.The world was better.It was like I had a power that could saver the world.No more.No starven.No need to work.No pain.No fighting.No war.No need to worry.No more without my say.To fix was only to dream.



That was before the nightmares began.
