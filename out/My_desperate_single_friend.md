Our friend Jaime's 25th birthday celebration was in full swing. We clinked glasses and shared stories that made our birthday girl double over with laughter. Jaime is not a millionaire or whatever but she's well enough to throw a party for 20 guests excluding her family. Me however, couldn't help but notice Darcy sitting quietly at the end of the table, her smile not quite reaching her eyes. Each time we mention our significant other or when the conversation drifted to romantic plans, she would take a sip of her drink and glance at her phone. I'm worried that her single status was weighing heavily on her tonight, especially surrounded by so many couples. I passed an "are you ok?" note to check in with her later, I suggest we step outside for some fresh air where we could talk without the boisterous party sounds.

"You can leave your burdens at home. We're all stressed out y'know? Let's have fun today and after this we can go back to our daily sh*tty adulthood life haha" I was trying to sound jolly. 

"When will I find a man? Is there something wrong with me?" She rubbed her arm and bowed her head.

"There is nothing wrong with you and there's nothing wrong with being single. Now let's go to the party or the others will worry about you too." I put my hand on her shoulder as we walk back to the party.

"If there's nothing wrong with being single how come a woman's worth is based on how many men likes her? Most movies with female protagonists have someone crushing on her. Yes she may not like the guy back but at least the guy likes her."

I let out a chuckle. "This romance thing is just like any aspect that makes this movie a movie. We love to add either romance or action in it to please a certain audience. Just because it's there doesn't mean it's important. Little boys love Superman, but they don't have to be powerful and strong like him."

She remained silent throughout the party while I check on her. She kept drinking champagne and having deep thoughts.

After the party we said our goodbyes with a quick hug. Jaime's voice still animated as she recounted her favorite moments from the day. Darcy smiled at us and nodded, playing her part until she could slip into her car and close the door. Once inside, the silence enveloped her like a cold blanket. She sat motionless, hands resting on the steering wheel, watching the others disappear around the corner. The laughter and connection she'd witnessed all evening had only highlighted the hollow space within her that seemed to grow larger with each passing day. Her eyes blinked slowly, she put her takeout foods and party souvenirs in the backseat. She started the engine and pulled away from the curb and drived home. I felt not just sad but hurt for her.

The next weekend I asked Darcy to go shopping with me. I really wanna make her happy. Shopping bags were dangling from our wrists as we decide which store to visit next. I paid for some of her things cause I never invite someone for a shopping if I can't provide at least a little for them. That's just how I am. While examining a display of sunglasses, we felt someone approach beside us, an average height man with kind eyes who asked our opinion on which frames suited him best. 

"How do I look, ladies?" The price tag still hanging on the sunglasses. He silently laughed and awkwardly took it off. We were silent for a while, until he proceed to chat with us.

"Say...uh, Ma'am. Are you single?" He was looking at Darcy. I didn't say anything but I smiled with my eyes widened by the sudden flirt.

"I always see you in Chicken Chicken Bang Bang restaurant." We let out a short laugh because it's just Chicken Bang restaurant. 

We continue to chat with him and it was mostly Darcy he was making jokes with. As they chatted, his warm smile and attentive questions made her smile in a way I never saw before. When he finally asked for her facebook account, Darcy fumbled with her phone, fingers suddenly clumsy with disbelief. I watched her act awkwardly in front of a man who looks so crazy for her. After we said goodbye to him I was happily shaking Darcy. The guy's name is Jude, cool and charismatic. She was smiling and I leaned my head on her shoulder. I'm so happy for her.

Ond day as we walked our dog in the park Jude surprised Darcy by covering her eyes. He started doing this everyday and everytime Darcy turn her head around him he always show up with different kinds of flowers everyday. Darcy starts to love herself and take good care of herself even more.

There was a time Jude gave her a necklace that has eye-shaped pendant. "What's the eye for?" She asked clutching the pendant with her two fingers. Parts of her hair were braided from both sides and tied to the back and she was wearing sky blue dress, she looks like a magical elf. "Because you said I have the most beautiful eyes you had ever seen." He kissed her forehead.

Two weeks later we had a double date. Me and Peter, Darcy and Jude. We went to a bar and ordered drinks and sing karaoke.

As me and Peter were chatting about things we suddenly heard Jude's loud aggressive voice. "I said hug me, b*tch!!" Jude had his fingers wrapped around Darcy's throat, her eyes wide with unmistakable fear. When he caught our shocked expressions he laughed dismissively, releasing his grip with casual indifference. "It's just a joke," he said, but his smile didn't reach his eyes. Darcy attempted a weak laugh, rubbing her neck, her gaze fixed on the floor. The air hung heavy with tension while I searched Darcy's face for any sign that she needed help. The jovial atmosphere of moments ago had vanished, replaced by a sickening awareness.

Peter grabbed Jude's arm firmly as we looked at the situation blazing with anger. "You're clearly drunk, Jude. What were you thinking, putting your hands around Darcy's neck like that?" I said with disgust while Jude swayed slightly, his expression a mix of confusion and defiance. Turning to Darcy, whose hand still trembled at her throat. I said firmly, "Go home without him. You're not safe with him tonight." Darcy nodded gratefully and we went outside carefully. As the headlights illuminated the night and the engine roared to life, Jude's face crumpled. "But how am I supposed to get home?" he whined, his bottom lip jutting out childishly. He stomped the floor and cried loudly. "Darcy, pick me up, Darcy!" His body was shaking up and down fast. "Drive me home!!"

Me and Peter can't stop talking about it in the car. "What the hell was that?" Peter looked confused as I am. I think his childish behavior after we left him was more disturbing than the choke.

The next day I called Darcy. “You have to leave him, Darcy,” I said firmly, my voice low but urgent. “He almost killed you.” Darcy took a long pause before she replied. “He’s not like that all the time… it’s only when he’s drunk.”

I leaned in, frustration laced with fear. “That doesn’t make it okay. You’re making excuses for someone who could’ve taken your life.” Darcy sounds like she's about to cry now. "He said he does that to his family too but he never caused any serious harm. He apologized and begged me many times to forgive him. He even kissed my hand and foot." 

I went silent, I was weirded out. "Okay, well, that's how you want it." I ended the call. If that's how he acts when he's drunk then he should never be drunk, ever. Oh my precious friend Darcy, you're so naive.

Valentine's Day came. We never talked about that incident anymore and I went to Darcy's house after my date with Peter.

I flopped onto the couch in Darcy’s living room, grinning as I unwrapped a small candy I took from her glass bowl. “Peter surprised me with Hershey’s and Stitch plushie today,” I said, holding up the shiny wrapper. “Nothing fancy, but sweet, y'know?” Darcy chuckled, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Well, let's see what Jude gave me. I haven't seen it yet." She reached for a small, black gift box on the coffee table. I leaned in with playful curiosity as Darcy lifted the lid—only to let out a strangled gasp. Inside, nestled in red tissue paper, was a real human eyeball. For a moment, neither of us moved. The room went silent except for the hum of the fridge, the horror of the moment sinking in like a stone.

I jumped knocking over her coffee. “Darcy, what the hell is that?!” I screamed, my voice cracking with panic. Darcy stumbled backward, her hand covering her mouth as tears welled in her eyes. “I—I didn’t know! I thought it was jewelry or something, I swear!” Her voice shook, rising in pitch. I backed away from the box like it might explode. “You need to leave him, now! This isn’t just drunk rage, Darcy—this is insane! That’s a human eye!” Her hands trembled as she tried to call 911, her breaths coming fast and ragged. Darcy collapsed onto the couch, sobbing uncontrollably. “Why would he do this to me?” she cried, her voice hoarse. “What does it mean?” Both of us were hysterical now, clutching each other in terror, the weight of the truth settling in like a nightmare neither of us could wake up from.

Red and blue lights flashes as the wail of sirens pierced the day. Me and Darcy stood at the edge of the sidewalk of Jude's home, our arms folded tightly against our chests, more from fear than the cold.

Jude’s house was quiet and ordinary. SWAT officers, guns raised, commands shouted. Neighbors peeked from behind curtains. Then they brought him out. Handcuffed, barefoot, and blood smeared down one side of his face like war paint. And he was missing an eye.

We hadn’t moved. Our feet rooted to the spot. But then something else caught our attention.

From inside the house, one of the paramedics called out, her voice sharp over the hum of chaos.

“We’ve got someone down here! Female, alive, barely!”

Another officer rushed toward the door, and then after what felt like an eternity they wheeled a stretcher out through the front door. But it wasn’t a victim in any normal sense.

It was a 15-20 year old girl with cerebral palsy. Her skin clinging to bones like paper stretched over wire. Whatever he did to this girl, I don't wanna imagine, and I hope it's not what I imagine.

Darcy’s hand flew to her mouth. My stomach turned. We hugged each other tightly and sobbed.
