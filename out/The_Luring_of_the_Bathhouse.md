I don’t know what drew me there, but I remember the way the old sign hung over the entrance, cracked and faded, like it hadn’t been touched in years. *Public Bath & Spa*, it read, though the letters were barely legible anymore. The creak of the hinges, as I pushed the door open, sent a shiver down my spine. I felt a pull, something deep in my gut, urging me to go inside. I didn’t hesitate. I was too tired to hesitate, too drained to question it.

Inside, the air was thick and heavy, like the warmth of an old blanket pulled from the back of a closet. The lobby was dim, and there was no one around. No receptionist, no customers, just rows of lockers and a faded sign that read *Self-Service Today* in elegant script. I almost laughed at the absurdity of it, at how the world kept spinning, kept demanding things, even when you had nothing left to give.

I walked further in, each step echoing softly in the empty space. It felt as though the place was holding its breath, waiting for something. For me. My footsteps were the only sound, the rhythm almost soothing. It was like stepping into a memory, one that I couldn’t quite place but that felt familiar all the same. The corridor stretched ahead, and the lights buzzed faintly above, bathing everything in a soft, golden glow. It felt right. The kind of quiet you crave when the world is too loud, when you’ve been holding onto too much for too long.

When I entered the main bath area, the steam curled up lazily from the water, inviting me in. The warmth wrapped around me, and for the first time in days, I felt like I could breathe again. The baths were empty, the benches lining the walls waiting patiently for someone to use them. It was just me, and that strange, nostalgic warmth.

I stripped down and eased into the water. It was perfect, the kind of heat that seeps into your bones and untangles all the knots that have been wound too tight. My muscles relaxed, and I closed my eyes, letting the water support me. It felt like the bath was holding me, cradling me in a way that I hadn’t been held since before Dad got sick. I felt tears prick at the back of my eyes, but I pushed them down. Not here. Not now.

The place was comforting, familiar, like it had been waiting for me all along. I wondered, briefly, if this was a sign, a place my father had once known, had once taken me to when I was too young to remember. But the thought slipped away as quickly as it came, lost in the warmth that surrounded me.

I don’t know how long I soaked in that false sense of safety, how long I let myself believe that the place was welcoming me, embracing me like an old friend. It was as if the walls had shifted, had softened, pretending to be something they weren’t. The bathhouse was pretending to be warm, soothing, the exact place I needed to be. I was too exhausted to see it for what it was—a façade, a trap.

The change came gradually, almost imperceptibly. The warmth seeped away just as slowly as light rain evaporated on a hot day, and with it, the illusion. The water grew cold, the steam dissipating into nothing. When I opened my eyes, the world around me had changed. The tiles were no longer clean but streaked with brown and green, mold growing in dark patches along the edges. The benches were splintered, rotting, the wood soft and crumbling. A foul stench, one that I hadn’t noticed before, filled the air. The sweet scent of nostalgia had turned sour, and I felt bile rise in my throat.

I scrambled out of the bath, my skin crawling with the realization that it had been soaking in filth. The towel I had left on the bench was gone, replaced by a tattered rag that looked like it hadn’t been touched in years. The air around me was thick, oppressive, pressing down on me, making it hard to breathe. The bathhouse was nothing more than a decaying husk, something rotten that had tried to rot me, too.

I needed to leave. But as I stumbled through the corridors, the walls seemed to close in on me, twisting and turning until I couldn’t tell where I was anymore. The lights above flickered, casting long shadows that stretched towards me, and for the first time, I felt truly, utterly alone. The place had lured me in, pretending to be safe, pretending to be something it wasn’t, and now it was trying to swallow me whole.

The corridors lead me in circles, and no matter how fast I walked, or how many doors I opened, I couldn’t find the exit. The smell of rot growing stronger with each step. My mind was screaming at me, but I couldn’t make sense of anything. All I knew was that I had to get out or this place would turn into my tomb.

I don’t know how long I wandered, how many times I passed the same rusted lockers, the same broken benches. All I knew was that I was trapped in a labyrinth of decay, a place that had been abandoned long ago. My skin crawled with the realization that I had been soaking in water that had been stagnant for who knows how many years. The images of mold and darkness flashed in my mind, taunting my ignorance.

By the time I found the exit, I was shaking, my breath coming in short, sharp gasps. I burst through the door, into the cold night air, only to be met with an empty lot, overgrown with weeds and littered with broken glass. The bathhouse was gone. There was nothing but darkness and decay, the remnants of something that had been abandoned long ago. I dropped to my knees, my mind reeling, the weight of everything crashing down on me at once. The grief, the loneliness, the exhaustion—I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I sobbed, the sound echoing in the emptiness around me, until I had nothing left.

When my partner pulled up, I was too far gone to care how I looked, too broken to even try to explain what had happened. I was afraid, not just of what I had seen, but of what it meant, of what they would think if they knew where I had been, what I had done. How could I explain that I had let myself be lured in by something so rotten? How could I ever make them understand?

They didn’t ask. They just helped me into the car, their arms around me, whispering that everything would be okay. But as I sat there, trembling, I wondered if it ever really would be. Could they ever understand what I had gone through, what I had seen? Could we ever truly understand each other, when I was carrying this darkness inside me?

When we got home, they drew a bath—clean, warm, safe. But as I sank into the water, I couldn’t shake the feeling of grime clinging to my skin, couldn’t forget the way the bathhouse had twisted, had pretended to be something it wasn’t. They sat by my side, their hand resting on my shoulder, and for a moment, I felt like I could almost believe that everything would be okay.

But the memory of that place lingers, like a stain that can’t be washed away. I know that it’s something I’ll carry with me, a weight that I’ll never truly escape. And sometimes, in the quiet moments, I wonder if they can see it, if they can feel the currents of decay still swirling around me, hidden beneath the calm surface.
