[Back again, and I'll get straight into it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ej56g4/i_miss_gramps/)

I fell asleep, and awoke to the sound of sirens in the middle of the night, a couple of minutes later, at around 2am. I stayed inside with the neighbours. After my parents had come back at around 3am, the police gathered us all around to inform us.

Gramps was dead.

He died a brutal death, and it was exactly as I had described. However, the police also informed me that the skin of his body was not found. I told them what I had seen, and that there was something wearing his skin. They were visibly disturbed, but didn't doubt me, after all no human could do something like that.

They finally left after deciding that we were safe in the neighbours house, who were doing their best to keep calm, but I could tell they were listening in to what the police was saying. We ended up not sleeping that night, and the next morning, we were to go home immediately and get the hell out of this place.

The neighbours offered breakfast, but we were all too horrified and stricken to eat. At the crack of dawn, mum had dad go out and bring the car closer, as they had parked it some ways from the neighbours property. He returned some time later, with the car, honking outside. We thanked the neighbours profusely and mum had tried offering money to show our gratitude, but they profusely declined.

Mum and I quickly ran out the house, hopping into the car, with utmost paranoia, and who wouldn't? This creature just came out of nowhere and fucking ripped gramps from the inside. Dad immediately started driving home. We'd be safe there. Right? I buckled my seatbelt and rest my head in my hands. There was no way this was real. It's so stupid, it shouldn't be real, but without a doubt; it was.

I looked behind us, looking back at gramps' house, the house I had grown up in, but also the house that would fuel my nightmares for years to come.

Then I saw it, with a shaky bump, the car rode over something, and from my view, I could see that the tyre had just rode over something. Something white... and wrinkly... and happened to look a damned lot like gramps. It was his skin. Fuck.

Where was the beast now? I couldn't tell mum or dad, I knew we just had to get out of here, and if I told them, we'd have to wait for the police. I could still see tyre treads over the lump of gramps' husk. I needed to puke. I watched dad driving, waiting for a good time to tell him to pull over to the nearest gas station or food chain restaurant for the toilet.

At the next red light, I informed him, and he said there was one coming up in a couple minutes. Fast forward to when we reach the gas station, and he turns around slowly, flashing a grin too sharp for my dad. With eyes too big for my dad, telling me we were here.

I practically jumped out the car, freaking the fuck out. I walked into the gas station, asking him where the toilet was. I eyed the car outside. I pleaded with him to lock the door to the station, and not to let anyone in. He glared at me suspiciously, but I told him that I had seen a gang robbing another gas station up ahead, and was just worried for him.

He closed the door, and pointed his finger behind him, I no longer needed to puke despite still feeling sick, but I'm a man who knows my priorities. I knew I needed a plan to save my mum.

I called my mum, asking her to come to the gas station to buy me a drink, as I left my wallet in the car, I told her to make sure dad stays in the car to watch over it. I asked again to let the gas station dude open the door so my mum could buy me a drink. He reluctantly agreed.

And as soon as my mum arrived, I regretted my decision. She was staring right at me, smiling daggers in my direction. and I looked behind her to the car, my family was ruined. My dad's body couldn't be seen.

The windows were caked with blood...
