Horror is the most personal genre of stories that you can write.

Romance, action, sci-fi all revolve around what the story itself contains. They are brief, but concise descriptions of the piece of fiction that you're about to read. Horror, on the other hand, transcends the barrier of fiction and focuses on the feeling it gives the reader.

That's when it gets personal. Horror is horror because it is *supposed* to affect you. There are levels of horror and perceptions that are just as different as our own DNA - for someone, Paranormal Activity might be just the scariest ever movie, and others might watch it as a bedtime story. An action movie fanatic will watch variants of the same movie for hours on end just for the adrenaline and fight scenes. A scary movie or story fanatic will change their taste, and the more they watch, the more immune they'll become.

Do you remember Bloody Mary? I do. 4th grade me was *terrified.* Now, I don't care that much. I've become desensitized to most stories, and begun to notice patterns all stories have.

Creepy house slash doll slash ritual, protagonist that says something like 'it will haunt me forever', entity. Whatever. I get it.

It's not the lack of originality that pisses me off, but the fact that it's just not *scary* anymore. Even if someone comes up with something new, some concept that hasn't been done before, it is lazily executed and the story itself is butchered and given a bleak ending, which enrages me.

I can't write anything that doesn't scare me. I need to feel it too, to know if the story is good, since I have years of experience of reading horror and my tolerance is built up. If it manages to scare me, it will scare 90% of my readers.

I figured I hadn't written a good story in a while, so I began searching for ideas. I picked on random things and concepts from around my house, garden, work, whatever, tried to find some twist to my day to day activities.

Late at night, drinking a glass of water on the porch. *What if something were to whistle, far in the darkness?*

Overdone. It would probably be followed up with some ominous ending, some creature or mimic.

Driving home. *What if the radio suddenly let out a warning to not go home?*

Aliens, mimics again, doppelg√§ngers, pandemic. Again, not that scary. Would be interesting for a minute, then my readers would forget all about it.

I just couldn't find anything that really intrigued me. I figured, I'd just consumed too much horror, so I needed a break. I rented out a cabin in the woods and tried to go on a detox kind of thing, where I'd sit in silence for days, no TV, no phone, just me and the forest, so that my imagination would start working again.

It was around the third night of my stay, and silence was now imprinted in my mind, my movements, my dreams. I had imagined various scenarios of stories, but nothing satisfied me enough.

A knock at the door pulled me out of my thoughts. I waited, thinking I must have imagined it. The house waited with me, ready and silent.

The knock came again.

I put one foot in front of the other and followed the sound to my front door. When I spoke, my voice sounded hoarse, almost unrecognizable.

"Yes?"

"I have a package for you."

"S-sorry?"

"I have a package for you."

"...Right. I, uh, I don't live here. The owner doesn't come back until-"

"No, this is for you. Reuben Hollis."

"I didn't order anything."

"You asked for inspiration."

I tilted my head, staring at a random spot on the door. Inspiration? Was this one of my fans?

"Who are you, if you don't mind?"

The person didn't answer.

The windows were beginning to darken their blue hue as night made its way to the cabin. Soon enough, moonlight would begin to slide off the wooden furniture and wool rugs, dusty photo frames and antiques. It was cold, but not cold enough to turn on the heating. Another uneventful night would follow.

And, yet... I wanted to open the door. So I did.

The porch was empty, and a carboard box was sitting in front of me, no labels, no nothing.

The person had left. Now, that I think about it, I can't remember whether it was a woman or a man's voice.

I stared at the box for a while, afraid to step outside and take it. What if someone was waiting for me to do that, so they could sneak behind me? What if the dark trees concealed something even more sinister, watching me? I lifted my gaze to the alley. Yeah, I was afraid of, um, animals. At least, that's what I told myself.

I lifted the box and shut the door behind me, locking it twice.

Now, I was sitting at the dining table with the box in front of me, debating whether to open it or not. I'd seen this before, and the possibilities of its contents were endless. It could've been a human head. Photographs. An endless void. Or a prank. Most likely.

Yeah, a prank. Surely.

I opened it like ripping off a band-aid, then looked away. Staring at the wall, I just couldn't pull myself to look inside. Finally, I turned slowly and peeked.

Inside the box were a bunch of papers, of all sizes and origins. Photos. Receipts. Prints. Envelopes.

Should I... touch them? Could I? What if they were dangerous, or poisoned, or laced, or, uh, crime evidence that I was contaminating?

Jesus, no one's out to get me. I should just calm down.

I noticed the papers were grouped and stapled together. I lifted one of the groups. The first piece of paper had a name on it. Paula Salvador.

I flipped through it, and found a shopping receipt, an address and print screens of some user's activity online on multiple forums, with certain words and sentences highlighted and annotated. The last paper of this group had a few phrases scribbled in ink:

*When Paula was younger, she was out driving with her dad very early in the morning, and a horse jumped out and landed on their windshield, breaking it. Broken glass went into her legs and the bloody scene remained imprinted on her for years. She is now afraid of horses and she never sits in the passenger's seat anymore.*

I realized the extracts were laying out this random woman's life and pulling out her darkest secrets and fears for me to read. I put the group aside and picked another one from the hundreds still waiting in the box.

I skimmed through it, then another, and another, until I'd covered about ten, some really disturbing, others mild, and yet intimate glimpses of the lives of strangers. Some of them contained weird, really specific fears.

Olly Higgins. Afraid of being eaten by rats in a tight space.

Jean Warner. Afraid of AI eventually killing her.

Ian Harolds. Afraid of accidentally killing his mother.

The papers were deeply personal, and I realized they practically contained cheat-codes to scaring these people. Those were their weak points, their soft spots.

That's when I remembered that horror was the most personal of genres, and my mind moved on to form another expected connection. What if I could combine these specific fears and situations and tailor stories to fit my readers?

What makes an experience truly scary? The feeling of being known. Of being seen. How *personal* it is.

The more specific, the more unnerving. Imagine being Paula and scrolling to read a story about a horse attacking a car in the middle of the night. Makes your breath stop a little, doesn't it?

That night, I turned on my laptop and began crafting the first of many stories. I tied together around 5 groups of papers, inserting weirdly specific things from the lives of these strangers and making it as ominous as I could, then I posted it and went to sleep.

The next day, it had blown up. I scrolled and read the comments.

*That was weird and unsettling, whoa*

*I never thought I'd see this trope executed like that. It's noon and I'm scared shitless. I fucking hate horses*

*This feels like someone reached inside my mind and pulled out one of my fears, congrats OP! Really good story*

I smiled, pride warming up my chest. I'd found the key to writing stories that latch onto the minds of my readers.

I worked and worked, day and night. I'd counted the material in the box and found a total of 213 sets detailing fears and weaknesses. That would last me enough to really distinguish myself as a writer.

The strangers I'd read about began appearing in the comment sections of their respective stories, admitting to how unsettled they felt while reading them.

Soon enough, people began to notice me as a writer and not just a username that occasionally pops up with a story.

*Well done again, Reuben, I shit my pants*

*I can't wait for your next post, omg*

Three months had passed, and my following doubled, then tripled, then doubled again. Soon enough, I got my first headline.

***MEET REUBEN HOLLIS, THE WRITER WHO KNOWS YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF***

More stories followed, and I got my first book deal less than 6 months after receiving the package. Things were going really well, but I was running out of papers. I jokingly stated I had writer's block, but I knew that, once the very intricate studies of stranger's lives stopped fueling me, I'd run out of content.

I booked another trip to that cabin and waited around, in hopes of another package arriving at my doorstep. In three days, the now familiar knock came again with a box, with its bearer nowhere to be seen.

This went on for three and a half years, a time where I published 4 books.

As my supply ran out, I would book another trip to the cabin and wait for the visitor to drop off what I needed. I didn't know who they were, but I didn't care.

My last trip to the cabin had me wait a bit longer for the package. When it finally came, I opened the box to find a single set of papers, stapled together.

*Reuben Hollis.*

I rubbed my face, and stretched my neck. The box was comically large, compared to the single stack of papers laying at the bottom. Somehow, I didn't want to read it. There wasn't anything I was afraid of. Over the past years, I'd written about every single fear a human being might have. There was nothing left for me.

I decided I wouldn't read it. I didn't need to know. I took the papers and put them away, and left the next day. I knew that had been the last package, and I didn't want to push my luck, so I retired from writing and spent the next years living off the money I'd already made, completely forgetting about my own file.

Last Wednesday, I heard a knock at the door.

"Yeah?"

"You didn't use the contents of the last package. If you don't write the story, it has nowhere to go, so it haunts you."

"I retired."

"You have to write the story. Those are the rules."

"It wouldn't scare anyone but me. It's pointless."

"It's not pointless. This is something easier for you. Your last prompt."

Then, it slid something under my door.

I stared at the crumpled piece of paper, then lifted it. The single sentence stared back at me.

*Reuben Hollis, afraid that the man behind his laptop is real.*

I shook my head, then threw away the paper. *That's bullshit. I'm not afraid of that,* I muttered to myself, as I rummaged through drawers, searching the other papers.

*Reuben Hollis, afraid that the man behind his laptop is real.*

*Reuben Hollis, afraid that the man behind his laptop is real.*

*Reuben Hollis, afraid that the man behind his laptop is real.*

*Reuben Hollis, afraid that the man behind his laptop is real.*

They all had the same fucking thing written onto them. That trope was so overused, I could never be afraid of it. Ever. Yeah, sometimes, when I was writing at night, I used to fear the darkness behind my laptop, but that was just my imagination. Nothing more, nothing less.

Day and night, I thought of that sentence. For some reason, it refused to leave my brain. I didn't want to write the story, because that would've made me think about a setting, a protagonist, a plot. Which would've carved it into my mind forever. There was no man behind my laptop.

This morning, I found a note inside my pocket. It simply said *The man is real* *now, but it's not a man.*

My heart twisted and my chest tensed up. My stomach felt empty, as if drained from all the blood.

My head flooded with thoughts...

The papers don't work.

And yet, they scared my readers, they were accurate, specific.

Mine wasn't specific.

Which is what makes it scarier.

It's just a story. Write it.

No, now it's too late.

*Reuben Hollis, afraid that the man behind his laptop is real.*

It can't be too late.

I remembered how I got the packages. I knew it was unnatural, and yet I didn't question it. I just accepted the offer. Was it too late now to pay the price? Write my own horror story, how hard can it be? The readers that had their fears immersed into my writing didn't have anything happen to them. I mean, I don't think they did. I never checked on them. I would've known, right? If their fears had come true?

I didn't care. I never cared. I just wanted to scare them. I didn't care to find out how their weaknesses had gotten into the box, or what happened after I'd pulled them out and written them.

I liked scaring people, but the writer was never supposed to be the one scared, or studied. I was merely a vessel. This should not happen.

I wanted to get this over with, so I started writing. I had this idea to cheat on the rules. Since they hadn't explicitly stated how to incorporate the prompt into my writing, I just wrote exactly what had happened until this very point. That's a story, right?

From time to time, I'd glance at the two notes on my desk.

*Reuben Hollis, afraid that the man behind his laptop is real.*

*The man is real* *now, but it's not a man.*

I finished it with some generic "it was all in my head" thing, then posted it. I wrote it with the night on, so that the darkness behind my laptop would not creep me out.

Relief washed over me as I refreshed the page and saw the upvotes coming in. I glanced at the three notes on my desk.

Three?

Wait. No, two. I'd put two pieces of paper out there.

And, yet, another one had been placed on top of them.

*Hello. Close your laptop.*

A sudden wave of dizziness hit me, my ears ringing from the tension. There was no way I'd close that laptop and look. I leaned back a little.

I could see under the table, and my eyes widened, my breath scarce, as I stared at the pair of ghastly feet crouched behind. I didn't blink for so long, my eyes teared up.

I was not going to move. Ever. I didn't know what to do, but I just figured I'd stall a bit.

From behind my laptop screen, a long, dirty and bony finger reached out and pressed the off button of my laptop.
