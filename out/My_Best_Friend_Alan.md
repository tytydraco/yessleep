My best friend Alan and I were best friends ever since secondary. We always would play games and mess around, you know what any other teenager would do. Everything was going great and we were inseparable. We formed a bond that could be compared to a mother's bond with her child. Everything went downhill ever since the accident, Alan and I were on our way back from a party that we were invited to, and I had a little too many shots and got drunk, Alan didn’t have as many so he insisted that he would drive but me being drunk and just fucking ignorant didn’t let him drive. We made our way to the car and when we were halfway home a Van had hit us. It hit the seat that Alan was on and instantly killed him.

Every day I blame myself for his death. I was expelled from school and got kicked out of my mom's house. I had no money and was forced to get a job and live with my dad. I moved out of my dad’s and got my own apartment but a few weeks later I kept hearing shouting from outside of my window. I lived on the 5th floor of the apartment building so I had no idea how anybody could shout so loud without waking anybody else up, I ignored it thinking it was just my mind playing tricks on me since I had so much going on. It kept happening and I kept getting woken up from my sleep, when I looked out there was nobody, maybe it was just some 13 or 15-year-old playing around or some other shit. This kept happening for the next 2 weeks when I finally had enough. I looked outside and I finally saw it. It was disgusting, I couldn’t describe what I saw other than just a lanky creature just standing there staring at me. The worst thing had to be the fact that it had Alan’s face and was trying to imitate him and tried to get me to leave my apartment. I finally had enough and decided to leave my room, since I had nothing left. No friends, no family and no love. When I left my room I heard something screeching across the corridor.

When I finally saw it run across the corridor I was greeted by a disgusting monster with skin as dark as charcoal and limbs approximately 1.5 metres in length. I embraced it. As this alien-like monster charged through the corridor, I was relieved that after all these years of trauma, I was now going to leave this hell of a world and join my best friend. When all of a sudden someone pushed me back into my room and forced it to lock, I was extremely confused as to who it was. When I managed to look out the peephole in my door I saw it was my neighbour, he stopped the door from opening. I tried my best to save him but the screeches kept getting louder, I realised that I couldn’t do anything. I looked out the peephole one last time but didn’t see him. All I saw was Alan’s face looking directly back at me, his face distorted, his smile smeared across his face from one eye socket to another and his eyes were missing. Oh Lord what the fuck did I do, why won’t you let me die? The creature left just as fast as it came, all it left was just a trail of blood.

A few hours after the incident police arrived and questioned everyone in the building. I kept telling them that it was a tall slender monster that killed him but they didn't believe me. After I kept telling them that it was that thing they put me in therapy too which I still go to this day.
