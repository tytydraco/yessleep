So. 

Finding my own dead body in my college’s bathroom stall was the least weird of the encounters I had that morning. I guess I’ll start from the beginning.

This will be split into multiple (2) parts. I don’t think I’ll get this all down in one post. 

Thankfully, I have my laptop charger. I’m still stuck in this fucking classroom.

They’re on the other side.

It’s no use trying to sugar-coat it. I’ve barricaded the door, but it’s only a matter of time.

They’re going to get in and it’s my fault.

It’s my fault for trying to play with fate—and actually thinking I could win.

…

…

9:15:am.

Adult Swim cartoons have always freaked me out.

Even as a fully grown adult I still get chills when I see them on my YouTube recommendations. 

I’m talking about the really old ones—the ones which gave us all nightmares. They are uncanny valley central, a glimpse into the wonderfully twisted mind of Junji Ito. At least his milder works. They teeter on the edge between fiction and reality, cartoon and realism, using simple things like shapes and oddly looking humanoid objects to generate a  response. You wouldn’t blink twice at a simple tree, right? But what if the tree had a mouth? What if it was moving closer and closer to the screen, and no matter what you do, it reaches you. It is nose to nose with you. And despite being separated by a screen, you react as if the damn thing is coming straight for your face. 

That is the type of shit I’m scared of. I’m scared of dreams where nothing makes sense. 

Not nightmares. Dreams which have a certain edge to them, a feeling of uneasiness like there is something wrong when nothing appears to be.

Adult Swim cartoons have always made me feel the same. There’s something about these shorts which awakens a certain fear inside me that I didn’t think existed. I’m not fazed by jump scares in horror movies, or classic monsters like zombies and werewolves. But the twisting, turning spiral on a flickering black and white screen surrounded by screaming heads can turn my legs to jelly and my thoughts to mush, triggering my fight or flight response. Horror can be subjective, but real, proper terror can be generated through simply not understanding something which is so strange, so fucking weird and surreal and out of this world, that it can be gut wrenchingly terrifying.

Which is exactly what I felt when I found my own body.

Like those cartoons, it didn’t fit with the confines of this reality. It didn’t make sense for there to be two of me.

Two of me in the same room—inches from each other.

I was both alive and dead, breathing, panicking, freaking the fuck out, and a corpse slumped against the boy’s stalls.

It’s not normal to find your own dead body, right?

That is what I was thinking, trying to desperately hold my mediocre breakfast down. I already felt nauseous and being face to face with my future demise sent my stomach catapulting into my throat. I knew death. Well, sort of. I had attended my grandma’s funeral and said goodbye to her open casket. I watched horror movies and TV shows where death is practically glamourised these days—and I even try and write it in my spare time, even if my own writing is sub-par at best since I struggle to kill off my own characters.

But did I know real death? Did I know death up close? Death which was practically screaming in my face? Did I know pristine white tiles  splattered in scarlet and pinkish matter painting every inch of the wall? No. No, I didn’t. And I didn’t want to. It was too fucking early in the morning to find myself murdered in a bathroom stall—despite standing right there. Despite being very much alive.

I knew I was alive. I could feel sour bile skating the back of my mouth, and the hard edge of the door I was squeezing onto for dear life. I slapped myself. Twice. Ow. I definitely wasn’t a ghost. Whatever I was looking at was yet to happen.  Fuck. Feeling my legs start to give way, I shot out my other hand to balance myself against the door. At some point my backpack had slipped off my shoulders, and the Starbucks latte I had been tentatively sipping crashed onto the ground in an almost cartoon-like fashion.

Automatically, my brain started to deny what I was seeing to protect me from inevitable trauma. But it’s not like I could ignore it. I was right there. It wasn’t a messed up hallucination. I knew that because I’d knelt in front of myself and reached out a shaky finger, prodding my jacket. It was the exact same jacket I was wearing, along with the white dress shirt I’d dug out of my closet an hour earlier, and a crumpled pair of shitty jeans. While I looked tolerable at best, my clothes freshly washed, my replica’s shirt was drenched in surreal and intense shades of red, my collar hanging open, buttons missing. I was slumped against white, my head drooped, my hands bound together in front of me, splattered in the same startling shade which was tainting me. 

What was left of my head dripped in bloody chunks of flesh and shattered skull pooling down the back wall. It’s weird. I didn’t think there were more colours in the body than the colour of blood. I was seeing grey and black, pinkish red and tinges of green and purple, my insides on display. 

Or at least the back of my head. 

My torso hadn’t been touched except one measly splash of scarlet. It was horrific, the kind of stuff I’d expect in a horror movie. the scene which was the ”oh shit” part—when the plot really started to kick in. It was right in my face, a vivid explosion I couldn’t look away from. Like it was intentional, as if someone had turned my fate into their own piece of art for me to gawk at like an idiot. Paint. That’s what I initially thought.

But that was just a coping mechanism. That was my brain trying to reassure me, pushing down the brewing panic creeping up my spine.  It wasn’t paint because the back of my head was hanging off. I couldn’t see much, but it was enough. It was enough for me to know from my bound hands in front of me in tough rope, and ugly chunks of my flesh spattered across the wall in an explosion of stomach churning gore—

I had suffered.

The lacerations on my wrists were a sure sign.

My murderer had taken great pleasure in covering every speck of white with pieces of me.

It wasn’t just my body though. Behind him was a grisly message written in his entrails. I could see exactly where an index finger had delved into the red, turning the wall, and my body, into a canvas. The word DON’T had been etched into the tiles above what was left of my head.

Don’t.

The handwriting reminded me of a doctor’s scrawl. I didn’t even question it. What was to question? If this was a message, who was it for?

I don’t know how long I stood there, staring at myself and wondering how it was possible for me to be in two separate places at once. Both alive and dead. I was well aware of time passing, but I couldn’t seem to move. To breathe. I was looking at my fate. Alone in the boy’s bathroom with my fucking head blown off. What a way to go, huh? And in college too? . 

I didn’t cry. I didn’t start screaming like an idiot. I just… stared. It wasn’t just the sight of my body, that it had been ripped apart by an unknown entity or person. That scared me, sure. But it was the fact that I was staring at a replica of myself—that is what was turning my gut, sending hysterical bubbles of laughter choking the back of my throat. There were two of me. Two of me which existed in the same room, and there was absolutely no logical explanation to why I was seeing this. 

Why I was seeing my fucking death. Eventually, I found myself back in reality. The fog over my eyes cleared and I took two shaky steps back. Something vibrated in my jeans. My phone. I pulled it out and stared at the notification lighting up my screen. It felt surreal to be doing something as habitual as looking at my cell while my body lay in front of me.

9:22am: Yo, you coming to class?

Blinking rapidly, I struggled to read the text when another flashed up.

9:23am: Get ur ass in here. I’m not doing this presentation on my own. You’re the talker!

Followed by a string of emoji’s my coffee drunk brain could barely process.

The messages had just come through. I spent far too long frowning at the text and trying to figure out what to reply with. Did I tell someone? It was right there in front of them, it’s not like they wouldn’t believe me. 

I glanced up from the screen to risk a second glance at my future fate—but I was gone. The walls were white again. There was no pooling red, no brains splattered across pristine tiles and a message written in my entrails. It was all gone. I was just looking at a normal stall; one with an empty toilet paper dispenser and a trash can overflowing with soda cans. It was mundane. Normal. And… that was enough. That was enough for me to squeeze my eyes shut and then open them, inhaling and then exhaling out shaky breaths until I was sure I wasn’t going to projectile my insides. I grabbed my bag with trembling hands and shouldered it. 

I was seeing things. 

That thought managed to force my legs to move, my feet to unstick from where they had been permanently glued for the last five minutes. 

Without looking back, I  turned around and exited the boy’s bathroom and back onto the hallway. 

My ears popped with the force of noise bleeding back into my brain, replacing the silence I had drowned in while trapped in my own thoughts—my own delusions. Back to normality, where a girl was loudly talking on her phone, and a guy leaned against the wall, his eyes stuck to his Switch. I made it into class ten minutes late. The professor’s voice barely pierced my ears as I sat and tried to concentrate on the presentation he was flicking through. But I couldn’t. I couldn’t stop thinking about what I had seen. 

It was like a movie; the exposition where the main protagonist finds themselves dead, and the explanation is—is what? That was fiction. That was an idea which had been written and directed and put onto the big screen. This was real life. 

Being face to face with my own dead body didn’t fit into the realms of this reality. Despite reassuring myself that what I saw was my mind playing tricks on me, the image wouldn’t leave my head; the nauseating blur of red and pink and grey, my brains covering the stall walls and floor—pieces of my skull hanging off my jacket like cat's teeth. It was in my head, drowning me, engulfing me until I felt like I was sinking into an oblivion only I knew. I was seeing things. But if that were true, how could I touch him? I had prodded his jacket and it felt real.—the material of my sherpa grazing my fingers felt real, as well as the warmth of his bound hands.

How could I have touched a hallucination?

Shaking my head, I focused on the professor standing on the stage. His expression was pinched but his eyes were bright and eager to teach. His hand movements were giving me a headache. The lecture hall was cosy enough. I usually used the class to catch up on sleep, lulled into slumber by the delicate sound of typing and soft snores around me. That morning, however, I was stiff in my seat. It wasn’t until we were maybe half an hour into the class, when I started to relax a little. My teacher’s words started to make sense, and I pulled out my laptop and started to make notes. 9:53. 

I caught the time on my lockscreen.  Mara Highcliffe raised her hand to ask a question. I remember leaning forward to squint at the screen, my gaze flicking back to my Google Doc to copy the paragraph written out. Mara was speaking, and I was typing along, keeping an eye on the screen for added notes. I didn’t hear the humming at first. It was a low murmur in my ears, barely noticeable. 

When I lifted my head, however, it grew louder in my ears like it was trying to crawl into my skull. Pain struck. Like a metal rod being stuck directly into my brain and stirred around. I remember sitting up in my chair, my arm reaching for my pack to pull out the Tylenol in my front pocket. But then the room was shaking. The floor and the ceiling, the desks rattling, chairs toppling. Everything was rattling, the quakes strong enough to almost catapult me from my seat. 

Earthquake, I thought, getting ready to duck under the desk like we were taught. But before I could move, the world around me exploded in a sudden mechanical roar, and at the corner of my eye, something… appeared. It appeared in grey smoke and loud screeching  noises, and it took me a moment to realise it had crashed into us, sending me flying back, the humming blowing my eardrums out.

 It felt like being tossed around in a washing cycle. 

I hit the ground, all the breath sucked from my lungs, stars dancing in the backs of my eyes. I think I passed out for a while, I’m not sure how long. It was long enough for me to slowly register in my head that something had crashed into us. I came to on my back, suffocating under what was left of one of the desks. Twisting my neck, I only saw rubble. And when  I looked closer, the bodies of my classmates. Some of them were still alive, gasping for breath underneath debris, while others were missing parts of them, limbs and heads and spattered gore dripping from every surface. 

Nick was inches away. His body had been crushed underneath debris from the stage. He was still alive. I could hear his laboured breaths. I could see his twitching limbs struggling under pieces of stage lodged inside his chest and torso. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t fucking move to save him. But even if I did—even if I managed to pull him out, there was so much… so much blood. When Nick stopped moving, his panting breaths slowing before stopping completely, I thought I was going to follow him.

“Nick!”

I listened out for his breathing, closing my eyes and trying to ignore the crushing sensation in my lungs. The feeling of drowning. Helplessness. Despair.

Something moved in the dark suddenly, catching my eye. 

It had to be rescuers. 

We were going to be saved. 

I opened my mouth to yell out for help with my remaining breath when I glimpsed a shadow dancing under emergency lights. 

When I looked closer, a fleshy looking tentacle was moving through the rubble. 

It was searching for something. 

This thing had intelligence, occasionally whipping around at the sound of pained cries and rubble shifting. I watched its every move as it twined its way through debris and dead bodies until it was face to face with a boy whose expression was frozen. His eyes were wide, lips parted in a silent cry. His leg had been torn off, and it looked like he’d crawled across the floor. The thing seemed to study the boy for a moment in what looked like intrigue, before it shot out like a snake grabbing its prey, and wrapping itself around his neck. I thought it was choking him first—and I could feel myself trying to move back, to stay out of its peripheral. But it kept squeezing. Until I realised its goal wasn’t to choke him, or make him hurt, suffer. It was to remove the head. It did so, successfully, ripping the head from the torso, and holding it like a prize. Though it didn’t just hold it. The thing continued to snake its way around the head, until it was melding itself with severed human flesh.

It shot forwards suddenly, almost like it was gleeful, ready to find more. Biting into my lower lip to stifle a yell clawing in my throat, I grabbed the corpse of a girl lying near me, throwing her on top of me as a shield. I had been sitting behind her the whole semester and it was only then did I notice her Sailor Moon backpack. 

It wasn’t a guaranteed safety, but it was better than being out in the open. I lay on my back and didn’t breathe. More of them came. I could feel them, slimy tendrils twining around my feet, up my body, searching for my head. When I was sure it was going to do the same to me, the thing shot off in the direction of Nick, who I thought was dead. I thought he was dead—and I’d been stupid enough to have hope that he wouldn’t end up with this cruel fate. I didn’t look. But I did hear the sickening snap of my best friend’s neck, and the slithery sound of the thing, whatever the fuck it was, leeching itself onto him.

They weren’t killing us, I thought, when the room erupted into screams from survivors still hanging onto life.

It was a harvest.

Shoving the girl’s corpse off of me, I knew I had to get out. They weren’t going to fall for my trick forever. Nick’s body was gone. And that was enough motivation for me to crawl from the debris, but my leg was stuck. I remember screaming in frustration and reaching out, trying to grasp hold of something to anchor me, to help me claw my way out. But something shimmered in front of me; an opaque wall made visible by a splintered piece of stage penetrating through. I don’t know why I moved towards it, reaching to press my fingertips against unearthly blue light bathing the darkness. 

It was mesmerising, the glow filling my brain with fog. My vision blurred, and I felt a sudden plunge. Like I was falling straight through the floor. But I didn’t find oblivion or darkness, or death. I didn’t enter the boy’s bathroom where I would eventually meet my maker. Instead, when I opened my eyes, I was being tossed from side to side, stood up, my hand grasping onto a hand-rail for dear life. “Ace.” Nick’s voice pierced my thoughts, but my brain was on overdrive. I knew that exact movement.

I knew the sound of low chatter and laughter, the uncomfortable feeling of being squashed like sardines. I was on the bus. Not just that. I was on the same bus I’d jumped on an hour ago to class. 

Looking around, everything was the same. The woman with the screaming baby, the man trying to read a book, sandwiched between two teenage girls who had spent the whole journey showing each other Tik-Toks. It was 8:45 again. Before I had found my body in the boy’s bathroom. Before I’d been crushed when something had crashed into our lecture hall—and that something wasn’t human. That something had used us, the surviving members of my English class, as  harvest for human hosts.

“Helloooo?”

Nick waved his hand in front of my face, and my stomach flipped over. I had seen him crushed under rubble and debris, his twitching hand trying to grasp for anything to hold onto. I saw him die. I saw what was left of him be torn apart, the living pieces of him used for spare parts. I had known Nicholas Santos since we were little kids. We met under a maple tree he had been trying to kick down, and being a weird six year old—I’d joined him. Since then we’ve been inseparable. Just seeing him alive filled me with copious amounts of joy, followed by lingering despair beginning to eat me up inside. He was still alive. But not for long. If what I had seen was real and I’d really come back one hour before, then he was going to die with the rest of my class. And I wasn’t going to let that happen. 

Nick poked me again. Harder. “You okay?”

Blinking rapidly, I nodded, taking all of him in. Nick, with his dorky glasses which were too big for his face, freckles speckling his cheeks, and curly dark hair poking from under his hood. He always looked like he’d gotten dressed in the dark, and that morning was no exception, brandishing an untucked shirt and skinny jeans which made him look like some kind of 2010’s hipster. Maybe that was the appeal. Maybe Nick wanted to look like Harry Potter if he’d been born in the late 90’s. Nick shot me a too-wide grin for a Monday morning. I wasn’t used to him smiling before 10am. Usually, I was the one who was desperately trying to rouse him from slumber. “Did you do the preferecation?”

At first, I thought I’d heard him wrong.

“Do you mean presentation?”

Nick looked confused for a moment before he nodded. “Oh, yeah. Presentation.”

Someone shoved past him to get to the front of the bus, almost sending him toppling. This had already happened. The first time, my friend scoffed and rolled his eyes, struggling to maintain his balance. 

This time, however, he twisted around, his eyes flashing. “Hey, asshole!” He yelled, causing a girl standing by us to almost jump out of her skin. I didn’t know he could yell like that.  “What would you have done if I was holding scolding hot chocolate, huh? Yeah! I’d soil your ass!”

I shoved him when the teenage girl’s in front of us sent him dirty looks. Luckily, Nick didn’t actually confront the guy. He wasn’t the confrontational type. “Sue.” I corrected. “That’s the second time you’ve mispronounced something today, are you okay?” When he didn’t look at me, frowning at his phone, I sighed. “You’re a broke nineteen year old with twenty dollars in your wallet. How are you going to sue?”

He shot me a grin “He doesn’t know that!"

Once the bus arrived on campus, I jumped off, pulling Nick with me. I was already putting together a plan in my head. I had to avoid my first class. If something was going to crash into the building, I wanted to be nowhere near room 405 when it happened. The two of us joined the stream of students heading into the main English building. Nick was in his own world as usual. I liked the way he walked. It wasn’t in a straight line, more of a topsy turvy kind of way, like his perspective of everything was slightly off balance. Tilted. Since we were kids, Nick had always been kind of… daydream-ey. If that’s the word. 

I’d catch him lost in his own thoughts, and he’d be too busy staring into space to see a dodgeball coming right for him. It’s not like it affected his intelligence. Nick was smart. Smarter than me. Though sometimes I wondered if he shared his mind with someone else. Someone who was far less attentive. I was used to watching him kick through fall leaves scattering the sidewalk and smiling to himself, but this time he seemed more awake. 

His head and shoulders were stiff and straight instead of slumped, and he seemed to full body scan every passer-by.  His steps seemed to straighten too. No longer lopsided and clumsy, they became a straight line. His pace quickened into a power-walk, and I hurried to catch up with him before slamming face-first into someone’s backpack. 

When the owner twisted around, I knew her. It was the girl who’s body I’d used as a shield. I remembered her neck was already broken when I pulled her on top of me, her head limply tipping left and right while I struggled to use her whole body to cover myself up from slimy tendrils. Her expression soured when all I could see was her limp body being torn apart. “Is there something on my face?”  

“No.” I said, and then I couldn’t help it. “Do you have Professor Tran this morning?"

She frowned. “In ten minutes, yeah." The girl’s gaze flicked to Nick—or to the yellow stain on his shirt I hadn’t noticed.

Her lips curved into a smile, her eyes drinking in all of that awkward charm. “Did you have eggs this morning?”

Nick’s eyes widened, his smile growing. “Are you psycho?” He hissed, leaning way too close to her. “Can you see into my head?”

It took me a moment to realise what Nick – a second year English Major—had meant to say.

“Psychic?” I said under my breath. “Seriously, what’s going on with you today?”

None of this had happened originally. Nick and I headed into the building, and I’d hurried into the bathroom to pee before seeing—

Well, I told you.

When the girl walked away, Nick turned to me. “Holy shit, is she psychic?”

“Your shirt.” I pointed to the stain. “Did you hit your head this morning? You’re mispronouncing basic words.”

But it was more than that, I thought. Nick wasn’t just mispronouncing things. He wasn’t even noticing it. 

I was following him up concrete steps into the English building when I heard it.

That same humming.

The humming which had crept inside my skull and taken over my brain before my entire world had exploded.

And the closer I got to the building, it seemed to waver when I risked a step back, and then striding forwards.

“You’re covered in egg!”

The voice shot through me when we headed inside the building. She appeared in a blur, dark red hair hanging in her eyes and a wide grin splitting her lips apart. I found myself smiling. The three of us had shared a childhood and then teenagehood. 

I had fond memories of trips to the lake, and summer outings and bike rides around town, burgers and milkshakes and 80’s music blasting in my ears. Next to me, Nick’s gaze seemed to go right through her. He took a step forwards to head into class, but I stopped him, grabbing onto his arm. What was he doing? We always met up on the steps outside class.  It was our thing. Like a ritual, we always met our third musketeer before heading in.

Risa.

I was trying to pay attention to her, the blur of red in front of me, but that noise—it wouldn’t stop.

The humming was driving me crazy, like a fucking chainsaw had been let rip inside my head.

She immediately ran over to Nick and licked her thumb, attempting to clean his shirt, her eyes glittering. It was no secret she had a crush on him. And had done since we were kids, often making it very obvious that she was interested. Nick was yet to recuperate those feelings. He wasn’t the type to tell feelings or harbour them. 

Nick was a free spirit. He dated girls and guys alike and didn’t label it because he didn’t want to. According to him, he just wanted to have fun in his college days and “find himself”. But it was getting harder to watch him either intentionally or unintentionally push Risa away. Part of me wondered if he was scared to like her. Admitting feelings meant settling down.

“What did you do?” Risa laughed. 

Risa was the only one I hadn’t seen dead—or at all.

“Risa.” Nick’s eyes narrowed. “It’s barely noticeable.”

Her expression twisted. “I kind of like it!” She grabbed his hand, leaning close to him.

Nick’s expression confused me. He didn’t look happy to see Risa. He looked kind of confused. When he shoved her away, a little more aggressively than necessary, Risa didn’t seem to mind. She grabbed my hand instead and dragged us through the doors onto the main hallway. The English building was cosy as hell. There were leather couches everywhere, worn red carpet and a modern style store just around the corner. Our class was just up the stairs. 

I had no intention of going there if what I saw was going to happen. Instead, I told Nick and Risa to wait for me while I ducked into the boy’s bathroom. 9:15. The time lit up my screen when I pulled my phone from my pocket and took slow strides towards the back stall. Sure enough, there I was. I seeing my body once again drowned in red, and that same message scrawled in pink and reddish mush. It was real. The reality of my situation hit me. Whatever I’d already been through was real. Looking closer at my body, though—something was different. My brains were still splattered across white, my head drooped, my hands still bound in my lap.

But something was different. Something about my corpse had… changed.

I was moving towards it when the door the boy’s bathroom opened and I twisted around.

Nick. He was leaning against the faucet, his arms folded. I noticed a change in him straight away. His eyes were less manic than they had been, and it looked like he’d cleaned up. The yellow stain was gone. “You okay?” He lifted a brow. “Thanks for abandoning me by the way.”

What was he talking about? I was just with him!

Ignoring his words, I sucked in a breath. “Can you… see that?” I gestured behind me.

Nick’s lip curled. He looked… pissed. And it was rare when he was pissed. “See what?”

“That!” I turned back to my body—which was gone.

Again.

Nick cleared his throat. “Are you okay? Ace, you’ve been acting weird all morning. Can you at least tell me you’re going to flake?”

“What are you talking about?”

He scowled. “You’ve been ignoring my texts! I’ve been waiting for you to call all morning, and you head to class without me—"

I cut him off, out of breath. “Would you believe anything I told you? Even if it sounded completely fucking crazy?”

“Everything but the earth being flat, and 9/11 being an inside job.” He groaned, leaning further back. “Why?”

“My body.” I hissed out, pointing to the stall. “I just.. I just saw my body, and it’s in that last stall.”

He cocked his head. “I’m sorry, what?”

“My body.” I repeated. “I came in here and saw myself with my brains blown out! And it’s real. At some point, I’m going to die.”

I choked out a laugh, one which I couldn’t help. “And do you want to know what the kicker is?”

“Ace.” My friend’s expression darkened. He straightened up. “We should… probably get to class,” he cleared his throat. “Did you say your roomie did shrooms?”

Nick’s ignorance was driving me crazy.

“I’m not on fucking shrooms.” I gritted out. “We just need to get out of here, okay? We can go back to my place.”

His lips curved into a smirk.  “And take more Shrooms?”

I was so close to punching him in the face. Instead, I glanced at the time.

9:20.

“Get Risa and wait for me, okay?”

Nick blinked. “What?”

He must have still been trying to register my earlier words.

“Risa!” I hissed. “Tell her not to go to class and wait for me.”

 “Uh, sure.” He forced a smile, but his cheeks were paling. Like he was worried.  “I’ll… I’ll do that. And I’ll leave you to… whatever this is.”

The door opened.

“I’ll be in class, Ace. We’ve got our presentation, remember?

When he was gone, I splashed my face with water and waited for my body to appear again. If it was bleeding in and out of existence, what I had seen could either be two things. It was either only visible to me because it was my future—or I was going fucking bonkers, and my deteriorating brain was sketching it up when it felt like traumatising me further. Nick and Risa were waiting for me outside the door when I finally decided to show my face. So, Nick had decided to stay. “Okay! So, where did you say we were going again? Did you say the café?”

“You changed your mind.” I raised a brow.

He shrugged. “Class is boring! Like, totally, radically boring, man.”

Risa looked confused, and maybe a little annoyed. “Not that I don’t like skipping, but what’s this about?”

“I feel sick.” I said.

“Oh, right! So, we’re like emotional support?”

“Sure.”

The English building and the cafeteria were connected. If I’m honest, I wanted to get off campus, but part of me wanted to know what exactly it was which had crashed into us. The cafeteria was mostly empty when we arrived. I grabbed a coffee, and Nick and Risa got milkshakes. “So.” Nick sipped his shake, eyeing me pensively across the table. “Why exactly are we truanting our academic duties again?”

“Why are you talking like that?” I demanded.

Next to him, Risa chuckled into her drink.

Nick sipped his shake, and I watched, baffled, as half of it dripped down his chin. “Like what?”

“That!” I bit back a yell. “Can you not hear yourself? You’ve been mispronouncing and getting basic words and phrases mixed up.”

His eyes widened. “I have?”

I was about to reply—maybe yell at him-- when the floor started shaking. Immediately, I dropped to the ground and dragged the others with me under the table. It started off like a usual earthquake. Maybe a 4 or a 5. Before a 9 was hitting out of nowhere. I was aware of Risa grasping my wrist and asking if it was over.  Nick was next to me, buried into himself. That’s what it did. It acted like it was over, it gave you false hope, before hitting ten—no, twenty times harder. I felt it like a thunderbolt in my head. The world was exploding around me once more, but not as apocalyptic as it had been in room 405. 

The table we had been sitting on was thrown upwards leaving us no shelter—and I could hear it. An almighty roar, which sounded like the gates of hell had opened. But in reality, it was the sound of something crashing into the English department.

There was still damage in the cafeteria, but we were still alive, still clutching each other as the ground underneath us threatened to throw us into the air. It hit me when I was crawling under another table which had survived the onslaught. If it was a simple crash, why could we feel it underneath us too? 

When another quake began, this one successfully dismantling our shelter, I grabbed onto the two of them. “We need to get out of here!” Risa screamed over the sounds of mechanical whining. “If we stay here we’re going to die!”

She was sobbing, screaming into the floor. Ahead of me, the doors were open, and I could make out what was left of the stairs which lead to the English department. No way out, I thought. Nick grabbed onto my wrist, squeezing hard. “She’s right,” he yelled. “If the college is collapsing…” He drifted off when the humming started again. This time I knew the two of them could hear it. Nick lifted his head slowly, his eyes wide. I could sense whatever it was, was inside him too, crawling into his skull like a nest of wasps scurrying their way inside his brain.

“It’s not collapsing!” I yelled over the sounds of screams suddenly erupting from every direction I was looking. “We’re being attacked.”

“What?!”

“Stay down.” I dragged the two of them with me, pressing our heads into the floor.

The screams were getting closer, and the humming followed—like a wave, like a sentient presence twining its way through rubble.

When Risa was suddenly tearing away from me and was on her feet, something warm crept its way up my throat.

I jumped up, pulling Nick with me.

We had to get out.

I started forwards, freezing in place, when I saw it again. This time it wasn’t a singular slithering tentacle. It already had the head of a girl, and was searching, slithering through rubble and desks. Her head wasn’t screwed on properly, and yet the eyes blinked, the lips twitching.

She had already seen us. In the blink of an eye, the thing moving towards us, and we were staggering back.

“What the fuck,” Nick spluttered out, “Is that?”

The thing stopped when it was inches away from us, and we were backed into a corner. “Need….” The voice was strained, inhuman, and yet it sounded just like a girl. Its pupils multiplied into twos and then three’s, it’s smile widening into a toothy grin. “Need…. another… body.”

When a second tentacle grew from the girl’s head, I jumped back. But the slithering piece of shit wasn’t after me. I was dragging him back with me, twisting around and trying to find a way out. But there wasn’t one. The cafeteria was folding it on itself, and all around me, we were surrounded. I saw them like shadows, tendrils with human limbs attached in odd places like they weren’t quite finished building a body yet. We were backed into a wall, when a tendril snapped out and wrapped itself around Nick’s foot. 

He hissed out and tried to shake it off, tried to kick it away, but the thing was a stubborn bastard. It was desperate. Starving. Once it had leached itself onto his leg, it yanked him onto his knees—and his hand was ripped from mine. 

I was aware I was yelling out, but another tendril burst from the girl’s head and found my flesh, wrapping itself around me. But not to choke me. Not to kill me or take my head. It was to restrain me. I looked it in the eye, in a dead girl’s eyes which were writhing, alive with something flickering around the iris. I wondered if it knew where I was supposed to die—that it wasn’t supposed to be there. Maybe that’s why the fucking piece of shit left me alone. But it didn’t let me have the simplest of mercy’s. Which was at least knocking me out, attacking me, so I was on my side or my stomach so I couldn’t… so I didn’t have to watch.

Risa screamed, her cry reverberating off of the walls. They were dragging her away, tendrils wrapped around her feet and torso.

But not Nick.

They needed him.

Like they needed him before.

This time I didn’t have the luxury of the dark, or even the ability to squeeze my eyes shut. I could feel the thing holding my eyelids open, forcing me to watch. They didn’t take his head this time. Instead, they burrowed inside his skull, leaching themselves to his brain and squeezing, squeezing, squeezing until the vessel’s in his eyes were popping, until a sickening snap sounded, and Nick’s head dropped. 

His body flopped to the ground, but she didn’t leave him, more and more tentacle-like things penetrating his skull until he no longer looked human. His torso was human. I could still see pieces of him which were Nick, but his head—slimy stringy fleshy pieces snaking from his eyes and entangled around his lips. 

It was doing the same as it had to the girl. 

Not  killing him. Harvesting him, turning him into something they could use. 

When the thing restraining me let me go, I hit the ground, and scurried backwards on my hands and knees, my gut knotted. Nick’s hands were twitching underneath him. I don’t know if that was a sign of the thing taking control of his main body, but all I could see, all I could think was that I’d seen this. I’d seen it fucking twice. I’d seen him die in the lecture hall, and then in the cafeteria right next to me.

I remember getting to my feet. I remember slipping on pooling red spreading around the corpse of my friend converting itself into a host. I could see tiny razor sharp teeth slick red. It was still fucking eating him, chewing right through his flesh until it was completely satisfied. This time there was no glistening opaque wall. I grabbed a piece of broken table, and started towards the monster with intent to mash its brains in until it was fleshy nothing.

But, no. I was falling again. 

Plunging. 

Stars were exploding in my eyes, and my head was spinning. I was falling again, but this time I felt all of it. I felt myself plunge, ripped from that timeline—the timeline where I’d watched Nick die once again. Maybe that was what I had to do. That’s why I kept snapping back to earlier on in the morning. Nick was somehow part of this. And whatever it was that kept taking me back, needed me to do something. This time I wasn’t on a bus. I was in class, my head buried in my arms. The teacher was droning about something I didn’t care about. When I lifted my head and looked at the time, it was almost 10:00am.

How could it be 10am?

The room should have been crushed, should have folded in on itself. I should have woken suffocating under collapsed rubble. Everything seemed normal. The girl with the Sailor Moon backpack was sitting in front of me, and my laptop was filled with notes I had no memory of taking. Class ended like usual, and I searched for Nick. But he was nowhere to be seen. I checked my phone for texts, but to my confusion, his name wasn’t in my contacts.

Weird.

Maybe I wiped my phone.

But the rest of my friends and family were there. The only one missing was Nick.

Filing out of the class with everyone else, my mind was on fire.

If I was in a world where a crash never happened, why did it still feel drastically different?

What, or who, had stopped it?

I was halfway down the corridor, my gaze on the two lines of students. One of them going into the room, and the other coming out. The students going in were talking amongst themselves, laughing and shoving each other. While the others weren’t even blinking, expression’s set into stoic smiles as they moved in almost robotic sync with each other. 

“Ace Marks, right?”

The all too familiar voice sent me twisting around to find myself face to face with Nick, who had swapped his usual comfy sweater and jeans for a lab-coat. His smile was far too wide, a clipboard pressed to his chest. Nick’s eyes pierced right through me, not a flicker of recognition on his face. 

“Are you here for your mandatory tetanus shot?”


…


That's it for now, I need to stop making noise.

So far, they've left me alone. But it could be a trap. 

I will leave you with my thoughts though. A question which has been driving me mad since I got myself locked in here. 

Who the fuck is Risa?
