I’ll have you all know that I wrestled with myself on whether to include my [conversation with Grayson](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1501ftn/how_to_survive_college_at_least_ive_got_the/) in this update.  This is deeply personal stuff, after all, and I know I’ve been careful to not say where I’m going to school and haven’t revealed any easily searchable names, but… I still feel a little guilty about talking about this with you all.

I can’t talk to Cassie or Maria though.  It’d be nice if I could talk to my mom, but considering our own history… it’d be kind of ripping open an old wound.  So I guess I’m talking to all of you about it.

(if you’re new, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/))

After Grayson got out of class the other day he’d responded to my texts and I’d told him briefly what happened with his dad.  Then I left him alone to deal with that problem however best he felt.  I figured if he needed my help, he’d ask.  Otherwise I didn’t want to make it any more difficult by inserting myself into the situation.

I didn’t hear from him for a few days and then he showed up at my dorm during a time he knew I’d be around.  Cassie was in class, so it was just the two of us.  He got me caught up on the obvious questions.  His dad was doing as well as could be expected at the moment.  He had these episodes sometimes where he got confused and wandered about.  Usually, someone would let him know and he’d come retrieve his dad and wait it out.

“I’m sorry I wasn’t answering my phone,” he said, embarrassed.  “I was busy.  I’m sorry you had to deal with this.”

I wish he wasn’t so alone.  As much hassle as my siblings are, I’m kind of glad I’m not an only child now, seeing what he’s having to do all by himself with no one to help.

“It’s fine,” I said gently.  “I’m glad I was there.  But… something worries me.  The flickering man knows who you are.  He seems to expect you to be keeping an eye on your dad.  Have you… interacted with him much?”

“A little.”  Grayson seemed uncomfortable admitting this and I can’t blame him for that.  But I needed to know this.  “He’s the creature most likely to talk with any of campus staff.  He likes to keep things orderly.”

“I’ve noticed that he seems a bit like the campus enforcer.”

Grayson grimaced.  He stared pensively out the window and at the low-hanging clouds coating the sky.

“He doesn’t like it when things change.  He just wants to maintain the status quo… no matter what.  And unfortunately, the president’s role is part of the status quo and I guess he’s not happy with how I’ve been handling my dad’s, uh, issues.”

“You sound like you don’t like him very much.”

I mean none of us like him very much but it’s nice to hear yet another person hating on him.

“He’s been pissing me off a lot lately,” Grayson sighed.  “I mean, first off, he got you fired.  Then this whole thing with my dad… my plans for after graduation.  He’s not been stalking me like he’s been following you and he’s certainly not going to hurt me, but every now and then when it rains I get to hear him complaining in my ear.”

Okay tinfoil hat time.  Plans for after graduation?  The flickering man doesn’t like change?  What if the flickering man is wanting Grayson to step up in his dad’s role after graduation?  Like how Kate’s family just passed the campground down through the generations, despite what it did to everyone that lived there.  It consumed them and maybe, this campus was devouring Grayson’s family in the same way.

“What are your plans for after graduation?” I asked.

He kept looking out the window and I felt like he wasn’t looking at the clouds anymore, but somewhere else, far far away.

“I want to leave,” he said quietly.  “I want to travel.  I want to go places.  I don’t want to be tied down here anymore.  There’s more opportunities out there than just… perpetuating the status quo.”

As someone who has left their own hometown for much the same reasons, I get it.  I reached out and took his hand and he tore his gaze from the window and gave me a weak smile.

“What about your dad?” I asked.  “What does he think about this?”

He was quiet for a long moment and then said that he didn’t think his dad was going to last much longer after graduation.  The school administration was fully aware of the situation with their president.  They were keeping it very, very quiet.  But there were plans for a replacement.  I didn’t press for any more details, because I felt so bad for Grayson.  His dad’s health was failing and it probably had something to do with this school, and he wasn’t even able to talk to anyone about it because the administration was trying to cover it all up and just slide a new replacement in as soon as his dad was… well… dead or in hospice, I guess.

Needless to say, I wasn’t in a great mood when Cassie and Maria showed back up at the dorm that afternoon.  I told them I was just worried about Grayson and other things I had no way to fix.  I felt a little bad for bringing the mood down like that, because it had seemed like Maria had come over specifically with something in mind, something she was excited about.  Now she appeared to be reconsidering.  I gave her a thin smile.

“It’s okay,” I said.  “Like I said, there’s nothing I can do about it now.  Maybe I just need a distraction to cheer myself up with, huh?”

Maria looked relieved that I’d given her permission to pitch whatever idea she’d come up with.  I wished I hadn’t, as soon as she blurted it out.  It was a terrible idea.  I hated it.

She wanted to go into the steam tunnels and look for doors that led to alternate places.

“But… why!?” I protested.

“We need answers,” she said firmly.  “We’re blundering around here with no idea why campus is like this, where these monsters came from, or how they work.  Sure, we’ve got some ideas and you’re writing those rules, but we’re only figuring these rules out when someone dies or is maimed.  I think it’s time we start being proactive.”

“The former Rain Chasers probably thought the same thing.”

“Yeah, but you’re different from them,” Maria said.  “Besides, they did find something, didn’t they?  That weird slab with the water.  That thing was significant in some way, wasn’t it?  What if there are other things out there?”

“That thing was a sacrificial altar,” I replied uncomfortably.  “I’m not keen on finding more stuff like that.”

“We don’t plan on interacting with it,” Cassie said calmly.  “Just look and document.  We won’t even go in.”

Oh no.  They’d already discussed this.  I should have been suspicious when they came into the room together.  I stared at Cassie for a moment and noticed how tightly her hands were clasped.  I had a bad feeling she was only entertaining this idea because she was in one of her moods where she felt responsible for her roommate’s disappearance and wanted to do something about it.  I needed to tell her what really happened.  It was upsetting but… she’s not over it.  She needed to know.  However, this didn’t feel like the right time to bring that up.  Besides, I had a couple other reasons for why we should not do the thing.

“They’re not safe,” I said peevishly.  “Steam ghost, remember?”

“But you’ve been using them,” Cassie said.  “Or at least, I thought I saw you going down to the basement the other day.”

I assured Cassie that no, I was not using the steam tunnels unless the only other option was dashing through a downpour.  She likely confused someone else for me, but knowing how paranoid all of ya’ll are, you can add ‘doppleganger’ to the list of potential campus entities.

Also this reminds me that I should really review the list of rules.  I only print them off once a semester so I’m not on top of this as I should be. Honestly with how disorganized I am I feel I should be making worse grades than I do but maybe I’m just one of those people that thrives on chaos.

…who am I kidding I 100% live on chaos.  Chaos and caffeine.

“I’m willing to risk the steam ghost,” Maria declared.  “If it tries to chase us out, then okay, we’ll let it chase us out.”

Ugh, she had a point.  We’ve had a couple close calls with the steam ghost but so far it hasn’t done anything other than mildly scald Grayson.  Obviously I don’t take anything off my list of ‘things I’m concerned about’ (haha that’s not how anxiety works) but it’s pretty low on the list.  I mean, I mentally rank ‘the devil himself showing up in the middle of an exam to tell me I’m answering question #14 wrong in front of the whole class’ as a bigger fear at this point.

I still had one more argument, though.

“And what about what’s on the other side of those doors?” I demanded.  “What if we find something actively dangerous?”

“You’ve seen the doors open to these other places a few times, right?” Maria asked.  “Did anything bad happen when you opened the door?”

“Not immediately.”

That was exactly her point.  Doors were a threshold, after all.  They were highly symbolic and formed a barrier against all sorts of creatures, or separated one world from the next.  So long as we didn’t cross the threshold, we’d be impervious to anything on the other side.  We could open the door, take a quick look, and then shut it again.

That was assuming we even found one of the gateways to another place, I pointed out sullenly.  And assuming that whatever was on the other side respected the threshold rules.  There were plenty of creatures on this campus that didn’t follow tradition.

“But the threshold rule is one of the big ones,” Maria said.

On one hand, it’s kind of great that she’s been paying attention, but on the other hand it’s kind of not great that she’s been paying attention and is now using this against me.  She was right, though.  Thresholds are significant in a lot of stories.  Honestly I’d be willing to bet that the threshold rule is more widespread than hospitality rules.  Which is really bold of me, considering I’m only about two-thirds of the way through my first folklore class and don’t really know a lot of stories that aren’t European.  Yeah, I’m that confident in the threshold rule.

“I really don’t want you going down there,” I said quietly.  “Please.  Stay out - for my sake?”

That almost worked.  I saw Maria hesitating.  But Cassie had a particular set to her jaw and my heart sank.  As much as I needed them to be safe, she needed to do something that might give her answers as to what was happening.  The piece of petrified wood was gone, after all, and she was no longer protected.  She’s the kind of person that has to take action and this was her way of feeling like she was doing something.  It wasn’t a great idea, it was unlikely to actually yield any useful results, but I think she was way past the point of thinking things through logically.  Don’t judge her too harshly.  We all make mistakes when we’re letting emotions run the show.

“Fine,” I sighed.  “I hate this, but I’ll go with you.”

Sorry everyone.  I’m still practicing standing up to people I don’t like.  It’s kind of, uh, *impossible* to do this with no practice and to people I like and who like me and I desperately want them to keep liking me.  I knew it was a bad idea, I hated walking down there with them, but I didn’t know how to convince them otherwise.  Should I have cried?  Told them about Steven, about my dad, about everything else I’d seen and that they hadn’t?

I don’t know.  I keep all that bottled tightly inside and it’s not something I can just let go of on command.

Cassie was in charge of keeping track of where we were at on the map and knowing the quickest exits.  Maria would go first and be in charge of opening doors, because she had actual reflexes in a panic situation.

“And you’re the voice of reason, obviously,” Maria said when I asked what my role was.  “If you think something is too dangerous, then it’s too dangerous to proceed.”

Cool, we’re utilizing my paranoia now.  Great.  I’m glad I can be useful.

So off we went into the steam tunnels.

We systematically tried the doors as we progressed.  Maria would crack them open a sliver and confirm that there was nothing interesting on the other side, then we’d move on to the next one.  It was all starting to feel like a massive waste of time and it was stupid hot down in those tunnels.  I suggested we call it quits and surprisingly, Maria and Cassie agreed.  We were almost to the student union, anyway.  We’d exit the tunnels and get some snacks or something and then head back to the dorms.

We reached the last door.  I admit I wasn’t paying much attention at this point, as I was already looking forward to getting out of the sweltering tunnels and declaring this entire adventure a failure that we shouldn’t bother to repeat.

But then Maria froze, her hand poised just inches from the handle.

And the door opened from the other side.

I admit that my first thought was ‘oh no we’ve been caught and we’re all getting expelled’ but then the door swung all the way open and there wasn’t much room left in my brain with all the blind, gibbering terror that flooded into it.

The doorway was filled with a faceless creature, its shoulders and head hunched down so that it could fit through the frame.  Its body was covered with what appeared to be fabric, like a person wrapped in a poorly made ghost costume, or perhaps a shroud.  The color was the same beige as the dorm room walls and it was misshapen in places, the fabric bulging or collapsing like a cloth doll that someone had done a poor job of stuffing.  I couldn’t make out much of its body, because it's torso and most of its legs were covered by its arms.

Countless arms.

They were bent at the elbow and the palms were clasped together, as if in prayer.  The hands were as normal as anyone else’s, although the flesh retained the pallid beige color of its clothing.  They started at the shoulder and then just… continued all the way down.  Like a caterpillar, I thought.  The hands, each positioned just below the preceding pair, looked like a zipper down the front of its body.

“Let’s shut this one,” I squeaked.

There we go.  Fulfilling my job as the voice of reason.  Go me.

Maria reached out to grab the handle but we hadn’t opened the door, it wasn’t ours to close.  This thought ran through my head in slow-motion as the creature shuffled a step forward, its foot hidden beneath the hem of its sack-robe, and then the rest of it squeezed through the doorway.

Its bulk filled the hallway.  It was almost bent in two under the low ceiling of the hallway.

“Leaving!” Cassie snapped.  “We’re leaving!”

She grabbed my wrist and Maria’s wrist and began dragging us away from the creature.  Neither of us needed much encouragement to start running down the corridor.  I tried to think of which way the closest exit was, tried to make sense of why the door opened without us touching it, but my thoughts were all a jumble of panic.  There was something behind us.  Something with way too many arms.

I turned to look, despite my better judgment.  The creature was following us, shuffling forward at a surprising pace despite its bulk.  Then… the hands unclasped.  The arms unfolded.  And just like a zipper, they opened up the front of its body as they released, and behind them was….

Nothing.

Like staring into the night sky and knowing it just goes on forever and ever.

A scream froze in my throat.  Those arms were reaching for us and they seemed to be growing longer, stretching out faster than we could flee.  One of them grasped my arm.  The touch was cool, but not cold.  The touch of something alive.  I wanted to throw up, seeing it's unnatural flesh wrapped around my own.

Another arm grabbed Maria.  She did scream.  And a third arm grabbed Cassie, who flailed at it, her fists bouncing uselessly off.

Then it just… shoved me aside.  It pushed me up against the wall and held me there long enough for it to shuffle past.  The fabric of its robe brushed against my face and I tried not to breathe, but I still inhaled enough to detect a faint chemical odor.  Like something that had been wrapped in plastic for a long time.

It pushed Cassie aside as well, shoving her up against the wall next to me.  Like we didn’t matter at all, I thought.  We were just in the way.  It was even pushing us to the side where there weren’t any pipes, so we wouldn’t get burned, and I don’t know if that was just coincidence or if it genuinely didn’t have any intention to hurt Cassie or I.

Maria, however.

Maria it shoved inside that void between its arms.

It was Cassie that reacted first.  Something in her snapped at the sight of Maria’s face, frozen in surprise, before it had vanished into the void.  She screeched and threw herself at the creature, grabbing at its robe with her hands and pulling at it, trying to drag it open or to drag herself inside after Maria, I’m not sure which.  The creature had let go of us both and was continuing down the hallway as if we didn’t exist.  I stumbled and then followed Cassie’s lead, grabbing hold of the robe and trying to pull it to a stop, trying to make it acknowledge us, anything.

The fabric clutched in my hands oddly enough felt like a cheap polyester blend.  We pulled, dug in our heels, and then panting I let go.  Our efforts hadn’t made any difference.  It simply did not care that we were there.

“W-what do we do now?” Cassie asked, her voice small and scared.

I shrugged helplessly.  We follow it, I said.  Follow it and hope that we can figure out what the hell it is and what we can do to get Maria back.  I needed time to think.  I had to be able to think of a solution.  So we trailed after it down the steam tunnel as it turned a corner and then came to some stairs.

“This is my fault,” Cassie whispered, horrified.  “I insisted we come down here.”

It slowly ascended the stairs and one of its hands unfolded and it shoved that door open.  It was one of the exits that led to the outdoors.  The resulting blast of cold air carried with it a hint of moisture.

Rain.  It was raining.  Cassie swore under her breath.  We’d checked the forecast specifically for this, but things changed quickly on campus and there was no signal in the steam tunnels.

The creature emerged out into the open air and straightened its back.  It had to be at least ten feet tall.  I stared at it from the doorway of the steam tunnel entrance hopelessly.  Beside me, Cassie was whispering about what we should do, because I was the expert, because I was the one that had to come up with an answer.

The creature paused.  Its arms unfolded again, revealing its midsection, and I tensed.  Did we run for it?  If we got inside, we’d at least be together and maybe find a way out, right?  Cassie seemed to be thinking the same thing, for she had grown tense beside me, and we looked at each other and she nodded tersely.  My mouth was dry with fear, but we had to do this.  We had to get Maria out.

Then the creature reached inside of the void with one hand and just… pulled her back out.  Just like that.  Its hand was gripped around her head and it moved her to the side and simply set her back down.  Then it kept walking.

Cassie gasped with relief and we both went running to check on Maria.  She glanced around, seemingly puzzled, then smiled as she turned around to face us.

“Oh hey,” she said.  “Too bad the steam tunnels were a bust, right?  I should probably head back to my dorm though, since it’s started raining.”

Then she raised a hand to wave goodbye to us and I realized that her arm was too long and the elbows were bending in the wrong direction.

Cassie took a step back.  We’d seen this before.  Last year, when she got a ride back from class and the driver was… like this.

“The rain changes things,” I said, my hands covering my mouth in horror.  “But it’s not the rain.  It’s this creature.  This thing comes out when it rains… and it changes people.”

We stared at Maria’s departing back.  Further ahead the creature shuffled through the rain and every now and then, its arms twitched as a student passed by it, oblivious to what was stalking through the rain right next to them.  Then it finally seemed to reach a decision, for it reached out, grabbed a nearby student, and shoved them into the depths of the void like it had done with Maria.  A few minutes later, it removed them, set them aside, and they kept walking like nothing had happened.

“She’s going to be okay, right?” Cassie asked.

“She should be,” I said.  I was trying to reassure both of us.  “We’ve seen this before - right?  The people that get changed turn back when it stops raining.”

“And when will that be?”

I shielded my phone from the rain as I looked at the screen.

“Tomorrow at noon,” I said miserably.

We both stared at Maria, shuffling down the sidewalk.  I tentatively suggested we check with her roommate and find out if she had any classes in the morning and if we should turn anything in for her, but Cassie pointed out that everyone she’d encountered that was… changed… acted as if nothing was wrong.  She’d go back to her room.  She’d go to class in the morning.  And maybe she’d change back once she was out of the rain.

I desperately hoped she’d change back once indoors.  Otherwise her roommate was in for a hell of a shock.

“I… I shouldn’t have insisted we go down there,” Cassie said miserably.  “I was just… I don’t know, I was thinking about Sarah and thought, what if she’s trapped somewhere and I just… haven’t been looking for her.  Then Maria comes along and just suggests it in passing and I… latched onto the idea.”

So I told her.  I told her that her former roommate was dead and I’d heard it from a creature that would not lie.

She cried the entire way back to our dorm room.

I held off on posting this until I could check in on Maria the next day.  Her arms, thankfully, were back to normal.  She also had no recollection of anything that happened in the steam tunnels after the door opened.  This didn’t seem unusual to her at first, not until I pointed out that she had a gap in her memories.  Only then did she go silent, staring at the ground with a confused and somewhat alarmed expression.  I waited while she sorted out the sequence of events in her head.  The door opened.  Then she was outside.

“What… happened?” she finally asked.

I told her.  How that creature had come out, grabbed her, and turned her into something else for a while.  How she’d said goodbye to us and walked off like nothing was wrong.

“Did your roommate say anything?” I asked.

“I… I don’t think I went back to the dorm at all,” she said, growing increasingly puzzled at her own behavior.  “I think I was out all night.  Why would I do that?”

“Because you weren’t yourself,” I said carefully.  “Your elbows were all… backward.”

“Really!?  Did you get photos?”

“Oh yeah sure I took a few selfies with my friend who turned into a monster,” I said sarcastically.  “No Maria, we were too busy freaking out over whether you were going to change back!”

Anyway, things have been super great after that.  Everyone looks so miserable that I can’t even feel smug about being right.  Maria seems embarrassed, Cassie is just… upset and bursting into tears at random points in the day, and I… well.  I’m just glad everyone is okay.  We won’t be trying this again.  Ever.  I promise.[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
