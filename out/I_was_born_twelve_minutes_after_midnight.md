The first half of last year sucked.  I even stopped running, which if you’ve been following my journey here, you know how dangerous that is for me.  I don’t think I’d given up - more like - I was exhausted.  Tired of striving for 525,588 minutes every year just to survive those 12.  Other people don’t have to live like this.  Normal people don’t know the very moment their life will be in danger. They don’t have to spend every waking moment watching it creep steadily closer, wondering if maybe this year is the year all their preparations fall apart and they don’t make it out of those twelve minutes alive.

Ignorance is truly bliss.

Fortunately, in March, I got the metaphorical kick in the ass I needed.  My phone rang and I was startled to see a number I hadn’t heard from in… I think it’s been well over a year at this point.  I scrambled to answer.

“We’re going to help you,” the nurse at the hospital where I was born said.  The one that put the doctor in touch with me.  The one that believes me.  “This can’t keep going on.”

I’m going to call her Susan.  That’s not her name.  But I’m going to need names to keep everything straight now.

Because there’s another nurse involved.  I’ll use a fake name of Tom.  Tom was working on the maternity ward and one day… someone died.  He was talking to the mother, nothing was out of the ordinary, vitals were fine, and they were going to be discharged within the hour.  The father was sitting in a chair, holding the baby.  And then he…

Died.

Just.  Died.

Tom remembered there was a strange feeling in the room, like the air was growing thick.  It was hard to breath.  The mother was nodding vacantly as he was talking and Tom paused, noticing her distraction, because perhaps she felt the same thing as he did.  He turned to look at the thermostat in the room, thinking maybe the temperature needed adjusted, and that’s how he saw the father slump sideways in the chair.

The next few seconds were a blur to Tom.  He threw himself towards the chair, not even thinking about the father, not even thinking about calling for help, because the man’s hands had gone lax and the baby was falling, head-first, towards the floor.

“He caught it, thank god,” Susan said.  “And then the man slid off the chair and landed on *him*, so he was trapped underneath this dead body, shielding a screaming infant in his arms, while the mother shrieked for help.”

“Did they figure out how he died?” I asked.

“Pulmonary embolism.  Except it wasn’t, because Tom was right there, and those have a distinctive appearance and the man looked *fine* as he was falling out of his chair.”

Looked perfectly fine, except he wasn’t.

“I’m assuming this was in the cursed room, right?” I asked.

The one closest to where I’d died as an infant.  Susan hesitated a moment.

“No,” she finally said.  “It was one floor down.”

I was silent as I considered the implications of this.  The vortex behind me was the biggest the doctor had ever seen.  There were people of all ages inside of it which meant… it was growing.  

And perhaps that meant that its influence was *also* growing, here in the real world, and pulling in more people as it did so.

“What happens if it hits some kind of - critical mass?” I asked wildly.  “Does it keep growing until it covers the earth?  Until I have nowhere to run to?  Maybe I should just - close it - it’s me it’s after-”

“Oh my GAWD please stop,” Susan snapped with a sigh.  “I’m calling because Tom wants to help find a way to close it that *doesn’t* involve some ridiculous noble sacrifice on your part.”

Since she was friends with him, he told her everything that happened.  And then because they were friends, when he started rambling about how he hadn’t been superstitious before but was reconsidering his beliefs, she told him that there was an unnatural component to the man’s death.  She told him why the maternity wing was built where it was and her own encounter with the vortex.  And then, when it was apparent that he believed her, she told Tom about me.

She promised to put us in touch.  Then, three months later, I met him in person as the moving company was carrying boxes into my new house.

Yeah.  I moved closer to where I was born.  It’s two hours away, but it’s better than having to get a plane across the country.  I found a job I could tolerate and took it.  I basically upended my entire life doing this, but I felt if I didn’t, I wouldn’t *have* a life in another couple of years.

It’s getting so hard to outrun it, after all.  I survived last year because of the doctor’s sacrifice.  Tom might have a plan for this year, but it scares me.

But I’m getting a little bit ahead of myself here.  I’ll talk about Tom’s plan in a moment.

My parents were surprised by the sudden change, but I told them I was unhappy where I was at and needed a fresh start.  They accepted my explanation without question, because I *was* unhappy.  Maybe it wasn’t a lie at all.  Maybe I really did need to start over - with a glimmer of hope, no less - because while I wouldn’t say I’m *happy* right now, I at least feel a little less panicky about the entire situation.

After all, for the first time I’m not doing this alone.

Which brings me back to Tom.

Tom is… *a lot*.  Susan is obviously the grounding force in their friendship.  When he pulled up in front of my house that first time, he was so anxious about meeting me that he hit the curb hard enough that he had to get his car’s front-end realigned.  Then he spilled out, tall, skinny, with messy brown hair and a wild look in his eyes.

“You’re her,” he blurted out as I approached on the lawn.  “The dead girl.”

Which is a hell of a way to greet someone.  Lucky for him I really *am* the dead girl, I guess.  I quieted him down before we got weird looks from the moving crew.  My bad for giving him my address in advance of the actual move date, I guess.

“I’m barely staying ahead of it,” I said quietly, when things settled down and we had our first strategy meeting.  “I got down to ten minute miles but I injured myself in the process.  I can shave off some more minutes, sure, but at some point - this year, maybe the next - I’m going to hit a wall.  Humans can only run so fast for so long.”

“Bicycle?” Susan suggested.

“Yeah, no, not after the car incident,” I said nervously.  “I think I have to evade it on my own power.”

“Running, right,” Tom said thoughtfully, his leg bouncing hard enough to shake the floor.  “Running.  Except - there *is* something you can use to assist that probably won’t count against you.”

Gravity, he said, as we all stared at him.  I could use gravity.

“So let me get this straight,” I said evenly once he was done explaining.  “You think I should run for over a mile down the side of a mountain?!”

It wasn’t quite that dramatic, he insisted.  More of a really long downslope than a mountain.  There was lots of that around here, since this part of the country has actual elevation changes, unlike where I moved from.  I was reluctantly starting to agree with his plan.  Running downhill *would* give me a desperately needed speed boost.  If it didn’t work and the void kept pace, well, I wouldn’t be any worse off than I would be without the elevation change and now we’d know yet another one of the rules of how this vortex works.  I was concerned about trail running *in the dark* but Tom had a plan for that as well.  He knew all the good locations because he liked to go mountain bike riding and he’d come with me on his bike with a portable floodlight.  He’d stay ahead of me, lighting the path.  Between that and a headlamp of my own, I should be okay.

“And then just before the twelve minutes is up,” he added, “you jump off a cliff.”

This is the plan.

We’ve been practicing for months to get the timing just right.

I run for 11 minutes and 40 seconds.  Tom will help keep pace from his bike.  If the timing is wrong, I keep running for the last 20 seconds.

If we’re in the right place at the right time… I stop.

I wait at the edge of a cliff.

And then, right before the void grabs me, I grab hold of the hands of one of the people trapped inside, hang on as tight as I can…

…and I throw myself off the side of the cliff.

It’s not very far to fall.  We’ve tried this already with a mound of leaves piled at the base.  It hurts a little, but so long as I land on my feet and roll with it, I’ll be okay.  And if something happens or if we timed this wrong and the void is still coming for me even at the base of the cliff, Susan will be waiting there with a baseball bat and running shoes of her own to fend them off and then flee with me until the 12 minutes are over.

Tom wants to know who is trapped inside that vortex.  And to do that, he wants to drag someone out of it.  Not let me or anyone else be dragged in.  But like the doctor did for me - pull someone out.  An adult.  Someone that might be able to tell us more about what’s inside of that void and give us some more clues on how to close it.

Or at the very least, we might bring someone back to life.  It’s a win-win, Tom thinks, although Susan and I are a little uncomfortable with the idea of subverting the natural order any more than we already have.  Or we condemn someone else to a life like mine, running from the void.  Although as Tom was quick to point out… I *am* still running.  It’s hard.  It’s terrifying.  It’s definitely caused some trauma (his words, not mine), but I’m still fighting for it and if given the choice, he thinks most people would make the same choice I’ve made every year.

To live.

I admit that it all sounded good in the months leading up to this moment.  Perhaps it was Tom’s enthusiasm that’s been carrying me along and now, watching the clock tick closer to when Tom and Susan pick me up to head out to the trail… I’m terrified.  I can’t believe I let him talk me into this.  Grab someone?  Pull them out of the void?  I can’t bear the thought of being that close to it, I think of what happened to my friend, to the doctor - of all those icy hands dragging me backwards to oblivion.

Or to an eternity of being trapped in that lightless hell.

It’s like I can feel it.  The vortex, just at my back.  It, too, is counting down the seconds until midnight.  And maybe it’s my imagination, as I sit here alone in my new house, but I swear I can hear the howls of the void, the cries of the people trapped inside.  Like the wind, just outside my window, except this is hungry and eager and it knows who I am.  

I want to throw up.

But more than that, I want to live, so screw the natural order, screw my fear.  I see their headlights in the driveway.  We’re doing it.  I’ll post this in a little bit, once we get to the trail.  And I promise… I’ll update this post as soon as it’s over.
