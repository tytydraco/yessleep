I FOUND THE DOCTOR.

Or rather, he found me.  I think the nurse I was talking to last year had something to do with it.  So… I guess I need to take back all the mental bad-mouthing I was doing after she ghosted me.  Somehow she found out who was there the night I was born, tracked him down, and got my contact info to him.

But before we get into the details of how that all shook out, I should recap.  I’m not going to review *everything* so it might be best if you got caught up if you’re unfamiliar with my situation.

So it’s been a year since I last posted.  A long, painful year of running twice a week, trying to increase my stamina and speed.  The same route, over and over, so that I know every inch of it.  I can’t afford to trip.  I can’t make mistakes.  I see other runners out there and think it would be so nice to just enjoy it as a recreational sport, to run with no fear, and no anguish thinking about the reason behind why I’m doing it.  Like I said… a painful year.

Literally painful.  All that running has given me a stress injury in my hip.  They think it’s a strain.

The timing couldn’t be worse.  It happened a month ago.  My primary care doctor sent me to a specialist and they prescribed physical therapy, explaining that this was the obligatory first step and insurance wouldn’t pay for anything else until we’d exhausted this option, anyway.  I admit I was a little hysterical during the office visit.  I mean, wouldn’t you be, if you were in my situation?  The tears didn’t get me any more immediate fixes, but the doctor did interpret them as meaning I was in considerable pain and gave me a script for the Very Good painkillers.

I took them only a couple days to see just what the side-effects were and how well I could function under their influence.  I’ve saved a dose for tonight.  I don’t care if this will undo weeks of PT.  I have to be able to run through the pain and through the injury.

What choice do I have?  The sight of the void, yawning open behind me, is seared into my mind.  I see the faces of the people trapped inside in my nightmares.  The desperation in their faces.  Their hands, reaching out for me.

For my entire life I’ve been fighting against the void.  I’ve had a lot of thoughts as to what it could be, but I’ve always assumed it was some sort of singular entity.  Death?  Oblivion?  Some other phenomena?  I mean, I’m not ruling those out.  I fear I’ll never know for certain what it is, but the least I can do for myself is figure out which theories are more plausible than others.

I’ve always thought of this as my own personal grim reaper.  It wasn’t because it felt *malevolent*, as any emotion I ascribed to it was merely the result of my own fear.  It’s like a hand around my heart and it’s been there since I was a child, hiding under the covers of my bed and watching the clock tick down to midnight.  Some days in the fall, when the leaves start to turn, it gets so tight that I can hardly breath.

I run.  I just keep running, even though my chest hurts and I want to break down and cry, because if I stop then - during the *practice* run - then I fear I will also stop when it really matters - when it’s my birthday and the void has opened up and is on my heels.

This is probably why I have a running injury right now.

For most of my life I’ve been focused on survival.  All of my planning was for finding better ways to escape the void.  I tried fighting against its pull, I tried using vehicles, and I feel I am running out of options.  Running is my current resort, but I question how long that’s going to last.  Another five years?  Ten?  And then what do I do when that starts to fail?  How do I keep outrunning the oblivion that faces me?

Because as we’ve seen in past years, it just might *be* oblivion.  It took my friend and it was as if she had never existed at all.  I… went to her house.  A few months after she vanished.  Someone else was living there and when I looked at the records online, it had sold only a few weeks after she vanished.  I guess the world just… fills in the gaps when someone is *unmade*.

I always post this before midnight so that you can be updated on what’s happened to me through the year in case I don’t make it.  But I guess that’s rather pointless, isn’t it?  If I don’t make it, all these posts will just vanish like I never existed at all and none of you will remember me.

I’m still here, doing it though.  Posting before midnight.  Maybe I just want to think that some of you are waiting with me.  Hoping that I get out okay, watching the clock like I do and waiting desperately for those twelve minutes after midnight to pass.

It makes me feel less alone.

I think… I’m more afraid this year than I’ve ever been.  It’s not just the injury, either.  I have pain meds to help me through that, after all, and I know I can run on them.  Like I said earlier, I’ve never thought of the void as particularly malevolent or evil.  It simply was.  I fear it, I hate it, I feel like it’s my relentless enemy, trying to drag me into the dark, but these are all reflections of my own emotions.

But last year?  When I held up the mirror and *saw* what those hands are?

I fear *them*.  All those people that died in that hospital, trying to drag me in with them.  Because I think they’re growing older just as I’m growing older and for some of them at least, the ones that died as infants, they’re growing stronger.

Maybe I’m about to get some answers, though.  The doctor that slipped the note to my parents contacted me.  I think the nurse I’d been talking to was asking around the hospital to find out the story behind why patients tended to die in that one area and he must have heard about it and started looking for me.  And well, he found these posts.  So he messaged me and he wants to talk.

Yes, future tense.  He wants to talk *tonight*.  In the time leading up to midnight.

I’ve tried to talk him out of it.  But he’s been insistent - says he knows what he’s asking for and would have it no other way.  He assures me that we’ll wrap up our conversation prior to midnight and I’ll be free to go on my way to outrun the void on my own.  He’s even sent me photos of the street outside his house to prove that it’s clear and doesn’t present tripping hazards.  Which all seems rather accommodating, right, except for the fact *he’s asking me to meet him right before the void that eats anyone in its path opens up*.

I got plane tickets.  I got a hotel.  And… I almost canceled on him anyway.  I was sitting there in the hotel room earlier today, looking at the address that he’d given me on my phone and thinking that there’s no good reason for him to want to meet me so close to midnight.  He *knows* what’s going to happen.  I started getting angry.  My predicament wasn’t something to be examined out of curiosity.  He could die.  I could die.

A familiar tightness took hold of my chest.  Then I saw something move in the corner of my eye, something dark, something that’s seared into my brain.  There, in the mirror, an empty gulf of nothingness and I heard a roaring in my ears and I thought - I swear - I heard voices.  Calling for me.

I jerked backwards, throwing myself across the bed towards the door.  I was panicked and uncoordinated.  I fell instead, slamming into the wall of the hotel room.  And when I stumbled to my feet, reeling, my gaze fell onto the mirror.

Nothing.  Nothing at all.

I called the doctor.  I asked him if he really understood what he was getting himself into.  I guess my voice was still shaking.

“You didn’t go to the hospital, did you?” he asked sharply.

I told him that no, I was at the hotel.  He heaved an audible sigh of relief.

“I thought it’d come for you,” he said.  “Don’t go back there.  Ever.  Are you still going to come by tonight?”

Yes.  I told him yes.

He’s as scared as I am… which means he knows something.

I’m actually posting this from inside my rental car just outside his house.  Typed it all up in advance and just copy/pasting it from my phone.

I’m going to go inside now.  I’ll update as soon as I can.

Think of me, if you would, until I update you with my success or you forget I even existed.
