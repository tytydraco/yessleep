The first half of last year sucked.  I even stopped running, which if you’ve been following my journey here, you know how dangerous that is for me.  I don’t think I’d given up - more like - I was exhausted.  Tired of striving for 525,588 minutes every year just to survive those 12.  Other people don’t have to live like this.  Normal people don’t know the very moment their life will be in danger. They don’t have to spend every waking moment watching it creep steadily closer, wondering if maybe this year is the year all their preparations fall apart and they don’t make it out of those twelve minutes alive.

Ignorance is truly bliss.

Fortunately, in March, I got the metaphorical kick in the ass I needed.  My phone rang and I was startled to see a number I hadn’t heard from in… I think it’s been well over a year at this point.  I scrambled to answer.

“We’re going to help you,” the nurse at the hospital where I was born said.  The one that put the doctor in touch with me.  The one that believes me.  “This can’t keep going on.”

I’m going to call her Susan.  That’s not her name.  But I’m going to need names to keep everything straight now.

Because there’s another nurse involved.  I’ll use a fake name of Tom.  Tom was working on the maternity ward and one day… someone died.  He was talking to the mother, nothing was out of the ordinary, vitals were fine, and they were going to be discharged within the hour.  The father was sitting in a chair, holding the baby.  And then he…

Died.

Just.  Died.

Tom remembered there was a strange feeling in the room, like the air was growing thick.  It was hard to breath.  The mother was nodding vacantly as he was talking and Tom paused, noticing her distraction, because perhaps she felt the same thing as he did.  He turned to look at the thermostat in the room, thinking maybe the temperature needed adjusted, and that’s how he saw the father slump sideways in the chair.

The next few seconds were a blur to Tom.  He threw himself towards the chair, not even thinking about the father, not even thinking about calling for help, because the man’s hands had gone lax and the baby was falling, head-first, towards the floor.

“He caught it, thank god,” Susan said.  “And then the man slid off the chair and landed on *him*, so he was trapped underneath this dead body, shielding a screaming infant in his arms, while the mother shrieked for help.”

“Did they figure out how he died?” I asked.

“Pulmonary embolism.  Except it wasn’t, because Tom was right there, and those have a distinctive appearance and the man looked *fine* as he was falling out of his chair.”

Looked perfectly fine, except he wasn’t.

“I’m assuming this was in the cursed room, right?” I asked.

The one closest to where I’d died as an infant.  Susan hesitated a moment.

“No,” she finally said.  “It was one floor down.”

I was silent as I considered the implications of this.  The vortex behind me was the biggest the doctor had ever seen.  There were people of all ages inside of it which meant… it was growing.  

And perhaps that meant that its influence was *also* growing, here in the real world, and pulling in more people as it did so.

“What happens if it hits some kind of - critical mass?” I asked wildly.  “Does it keep growing until it covers the earth?  Until I have nowhere to run to?  Maybe I should just - close it - it’s me it’s after-”

“Oh my GAWD please stop,” Susan snapped with a sigh.  “I’m calling because Tom wants to help find a way to close it that *doesn’t* involve some ridiculous noble sacrifice on your part.”

Since she was friends with him, he told her everything that happened.  And then because they were friends, when he started rambling about how he hadn’t been superstitious before but was reconsidering his beliefs, she told him that there was an unnatural component to the man’s death.  She told him why the maternity wing was built where it was and her own encounter with the vortex.  And then, when it was apparent that he believed her, she told Tom about me.

She promised to put us in touch.  Then, three months later, I met him in person as the moving company was carrying boxes into my new house.

Yeah.  I moved closer to where I was born.  It’s two hours away, but it’s better than having to get a plane across the country.  I found a job I could tolerate and took it.  I basically upended my entire life doing this, but I felt if I didn’t, I wouldn’t *have* a life in another couple of years.

It’s getting so hard to outrun it, after all.  I survived last year because of the doctor’s sacrifice.  Tom might have a plan for this year, but it scares me.

But I’m getting a little bit ahead of myself here.  I’ll talk about Tom’s plan in a moment.

My parents were surprised by the sudden change, but I told them I was unhappy where I was at and needed a fresh start.  They accepted my explanation without question, because I *was* unhappy.  Maybe it wasn’t a lie at all.  Maybe I really did need to start over - with a glimmer of hope, no less - because while I wouldn’t say I’m *happy* right now, I at least feel a little less panicky about the entire situation.

After all, for the first time I’m not doing this alone.

Which brings me back to Tom.

Tom is… *a lot*.  Susan is obviously the grounding force in their friendship.  When he pulled up in front of my house that first time, he was so anxious about meeting me that he hit the curb hard enough that he had to get his car’s front-end realigned.  Then he spilled out, tall, skinny, with messy brown hair and a wild look in his eyes.

“You’re her,” he blurted out as I approached on the lawn.  “The dead girl.”

Which is a hell of a way to greet someone.  Lucky for him I really *am* the dead girl, I guess.  I quieted him down before we got weird looks from the moving crew.  My bad for giving him my address in advance of the actual move date, I guess.

“I’m barely staying ahead of it,” I said quietly, when things settled down and we had our first strategy meeting.  “I got down to ten minute miles but I injured myself in the process.  I can shave off some more minutes, sure, but at some point - this year, maybe the next - I’m going to hit a wall.  Humans can only run so fast for so long.”

“Bicycle?” Susan suggested.

“Yeah, no, not after the car incident,” I said nervously.  “I think I have to evade it on my own power.”

“Running, right,” Tom said thoughtfully, his leg bouncing hard enough to shake the floor.  “Running.  Except - there *is* something you can use to assist that probably won’t count against you.”

Gravity, he said, as we all stared at him.  I could use gravity.

“So let me get this straight,” I said evenly once he was done explaining.  “You think I should run for over a mile down the side of a mountain?!”

It wasn’t quite that dramatic, he insisted.  More of a really long downslope than a mountain.  There was lots of that around here, since this part of the country has actual elevation changes, unlike where I moved from.  I was reluctantly starting to agree with his plan.  Running downhill *would* give me a desperately needed speed boost.  If it didn’t work and the void kept pace, well, I wouldn’t be any worse off than I would be without the elevation change and now we’d know yet another one of the rules of how this vortex works.  I was concerned about trail running *in the dark* but Tom had a plan for that as well.  He knew all the good locations because he liked to go mountain bike riding and he’d come with me on his bike with a portable floodlight.  He’d stay ahead of me, lighting the path.  Between that and a headlamp of my own, I should be okay.

“And then just before the twelve minutes is up,” he added, “you jump off a cliff.”

This is the plan.

We’ve been practicing for months to get the timing just right.

I run for 11 minutes and 40 seconds.  Tom will help keep pace from his bike.  If the timing is wrong, I keep running for the last 20 seconds.

If we’re in the right place at the right time… I stop.

I wait at the edge of a cliff.

And then, right before the void grabs me, I grab hold of the hands of one of the people trapped inside, hang on as tight as I can…

…and I throw myself off the side of the cliff.

It’s not very far to fall.  We’ve tried this already with a mound of leaves piled at the base.  It hurts a little, but so long as I land on my feet and roll with it, I’ll be okay.  And if something happens or if we timed this wrong and the void is still coming for me even at the base of the cliff, Susan will be waiting there with a baseball bat and running shoes of her own to fend them off and then flee with me until the 12 minutes are over.

Tom wants to know who is trapped inside that vortex.  And to do that, he wants to drag someone out of it.  Not let me or anyone else be dragged in.  But like the doctor did for me - pull someone out.  An adult.  Someone that might be able to tell us more about what’s inside of that void and give us some more clues on how to close it.

Or at the very least, we might bring someone back to life.  It’s a win-win, Tom thinks, although Susan and I are a little uncomfortable with the idea of subverting the natural order any more than we already have.  Or we condemn someone else to a life like mine, running from the void.  Although as Tom was quick to point out… I *am* still running.  It’s hard.  It’s terrifying.  It’s definitely caused some trauma (his words, not mine), but I’m still fighting for it and if given the choice, he thinks most people would make the same choice I’ve made every year.

To live.

I admit that it all sounded good in the months leading up to this moment.  Perhaps it was Tom’s enthusiasm that’s been carrying me along and now, watching the clock tick closer to when Tom and Susan pick me up to head out to the trail… I’m terrified.  I can’t believe I let him talk me into this.  Grab someone?  Pull them out of the void?  I can’t bear the thought of being that close to it, I think of what happened to my friend, to the doctor - of all those icy hands dragging me backwards to oblivion.

Or to an eternity of being trapped in that lightless hell.

It’s like I can feel it.  The vortex, just at my back.  It, too, is counting down the seconds until midnight.  And maybe it’s my imagination, as I sit here alone in my new house, but I swear I can hear the howls of the void, the cries of the people trapped inside.  Like the wind, just outside my window, except this is hungry and eager and it knows who I am.  

I want to throw up.

But more than that, I want to live, so screw the natural order, screw my fear.  I see their headlights in the driveway.  We’re doing it.  I’ll post this in a little bit, once we get to the trail.  And I promise… I’ll update this post as soon as it’s over.



Okay.  I’m alive.  Tom is alive.  Susan is alive.

And so is… the person I pulled out.

Unbelievably, everything went according to Tom’s plan.  I feel… exhilarated?  Giddy?  Probably going to stop sobbing as soon as the adrenaline high crashes?  All of these at once.

The trail we used is accessible by car.  From the parking lot, you can either go up or down and obviously we were going down.  We only needed a bit over a mile, after all.  Tom unloaded his bike and the floodlight and we got into position.  My skin prickled as we waited, like the air around us was growing thinner and I could feel the touch of fingers, anxious to drag me back into their embrace.  My nerves were about ready to snap and while we’d done this dozens of times before, I wanted to yell at Tom that him counting down the seconds wasn’t actually making me feel better.

With fifteen seconds to spare, I started running.  Tom got his bike going, barely peddling to stay ahead of us, with a floodlight on his back and a mirror on his handlebars through which he would be able to see the void.  Then, exactly at midnight, I felt it.  I felt the wind and cold around me twist, I felt the ice of terror stab through my gut, and the race for my life began in earnest.

My feet struck the ground hard as I stretched my legs out as far as I could, letting gravity carry me forward.  The cold night air on the back of my neck was indistinguishable from the touch of the void and my lungs burned, constricting with terror, because surely this wasn’t working - I was going to die -

“It’s working!” Tom yelled back at me.  “It’s falling behind!  Eleven minutes to go!”

I could have cried, but I couldn’t, not yet, not until it was done.  I ran, trusting to my practice, trusting to my form as my feet hit the packed earth and I watched for stones or potholes in the trail in front of me, illuminated by both of our lights so that the only thing I could see was the path directly ahead, the darkness swallowing up the rest of the world around me.  And Tom kept yelling back to me, that we had reached the two minute mark, then the five, that everything was just as we’d planned, that I was still ahead of the void.

“We’re coming up on the ridge,” he yelled back.  “You need to slow down.”

He cut sideways, putting some distance between himself and where I’d wait for the vortex so that it couldn’t reach out and grab him.  I skidded to a stop at the edge of the ridge.  It was a short line where the soil fell away to an exposed rock face.  It wasn’t even that high up.  Below us, I saw Susan waiting for us with a headlamp of her own.  She held a baseball bat with both hands.  Just in case.

“Here it comes,” Tom called out.  

I couldn’t breath.  It was like the world was slowing to a stop around me.

“There’s - there’s one - I recognize him!  You need to grab him!”

I couldn’t.  I was frozen in place, my skin rapidly cooling in the cold air, puff of steam escaping my numb lips.  I couldn’t do this.  I had to keep running, like I’d done for years now, because my death was snapping at my heels -

“Please!”

I heard his desperation.  He needed me to pull this person out, because it would bring them back to life, and there was something *personal* in his plea.  He couldn’t do it himself.

Only I could.

I turned.  

Behind me was a gaping tear in the world, pitch-black, save for the shadowy forms stretching their arms out, fingers splayed, dragging themselves towards me in desperation.  My mouth was dry.  I was barely hearing what Tom was yelling at me, but a few words made it through.  That one.  The one in the center.  The one who was more desperate than all the others, the one that was the furthest out of the vortex, whose torso was almost free.  Grab that one.

And I did.  It felt like it wasn’t myself who was moving.  Like I was a bystander, watching someone braver and stronger than I was.  Someone who stretched out a hand and grabbed the man’s hand - because even without Tom telling me I knew who it was, it was the father who died and dropped his newborn baby, the patient that Tom knew shouldn’t have died, the one that spurred him to risk his career, his reputation to seek me out - I wrapped my fingers around his wrist as tight as I could.  I felt hands brush my arms, my ankles, but it was too late for those still trapped in the vortex, I was stepping backwards out of their reach, I was turning, I was pulling and then I was falling and for a moment the world was wind and darkness -

\- then I hit the leaves and the ground, feet-first, I was tumbling forward, I heard Susan yelling but I didn’t know what she was saying, I felt her grabbing my arms saying run, run, and I did, but only for a few paces before my watch sounded an alarm and it was over, it was twelve minutes past midnight and I was alive.

As was Susan.  As was Tom.

And as was the man picking himself up off the forest floor.

I wish I could tell you everything about him, but we only talked long enough to get our bearings on what the heck had just happened.  The last thing he remembered was that he was in the hospital and now he was here.   And he desperately wanted to see his wife and child and know that they were okay.  Everything else could wait until after that.  I’m sure this will frustrate some of you, but we agreed.  I know you’re anxious for answers - believe me, I *know* \- but he lives in the area and we’ve got a whole year to figure it out with him.

I want to laugh.  Another year.  I have another year.  And I didn’t just outrun the void - I *gained ground* on it.  *I pulled someone out.*  

For the first time in my life, I feel like maybe things have changed for the better.

Tom volunteered to drive the man home.  Susan could take me home.  And I’ve been in the back seat of her car, typing this up, so that I could let you all know as soon as possible that I’m alive for another year.

I guess we’ll find out next year if anything has changed inside the vortex.
