[Previous Year's Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hicdd6/i_was_born_twelve_minutes_after_midnigh)

Tom has been unstoppable.  *I* feel unstoppable.  I also maybe want to vomit because I’m so nervous and so scared, but you know, it’s all a balancing act.  Gotta psych myself up enough to go through with this.  Because this year… I’m not running.

I’m getting a little ahead of myself.  I was born twelve minutes after midnight, or at least, that’s what my birth certificate says.  The truth is that I was born at midnight, dead, until the doctor that delivered me pulled me out of death’s grip and brought me back to my parents.  Literally.  Literally pulled me out of a void and back into the world of the living.  But there are consequences to defying the natural order of things, though.  Every year, on my birthday, during those twelve minutes in which I was dead, the void gets a chance to drag me back in.

It’s been getting stronger.  For years I thought it was because I was getting older but… I met the doctor that saved me, just as he’d been saved himself as a child.  And he told me - before he gave himself up to oblivion - that the death that followed me was so much bigger than the one that had followed him.

And now, thanks to my friends Tom and Susan, we’re one step closer to understanding why that is.

Tom and Susan are both nurses at the hospital where I was born.  Last year, Tom had an idea that I wouldn’t just outrun the void, but that I’d let it catch up and in the last few seconds before it vanished, I’d pull someone out.  It was terrifying.  It was an idiotic risk.  And it worked.  I seized someone, a young father who had been in the room below mine when I was born and died for no reason other than the proximity to the void, and dragged him out.  We got him home and it was like he’d never died.  Like he’d never even been gone.  Just as reality had written people out of existence, it at least was willing to write this person back in.  I gave him his life back.  Then Tom, flush with victory, proposed Phase 2 of his plan.

He’d had it in the back of his head, from the moment he met me.  And after the holidays wound down, we all met up at his apartment to talk through about what had happened.  The person I’d rescued from the void was not among us.  Susan had reached out, but he’d declined to have anything more to do with us.  With… *this.*  None of us blame him.  He has a family, he has a newborn to worry about.  That’s enough.  I can’t really expect himself to put his life on the line when he had nothing to do with this other than being unfortunate enough to be sitting close enough for the vortex to reach out and snag.  No, the people that will be risking themselves to… stop this thing… will be us.

Because Tom does want to stop it.

*I* want to stop it.  I just haven’t thought that was possible until now.

“We know there’s a multitude of people inside that vortex,” Tom said, after we’d all settled at the kitchen table with our hot cocoa.  “And they’re people that it has swallowed that perhaps shouldn’t have died when they did.”

“What I don’t understand is why some people vanish,” Susan said.  “Like the doctor.  And your friend.”

I’d told them what happened to my friend, all those years back when she went running with me.  How it was like she’d never existed at all.

“I think it has to do with me,” I said.  “It erased the doctor back to the point of when he was *supposed* to die.  And it’s trying to erase me as well, and in my case it’s at the point of my birth. So when it took my friend in my place… it erased her like she’d never been born at all.”

Everyone else had just been caught up in its radius, like the new father I’d rescued just a few weeks prior.  We were quiet for a moment, considering this.  It’d taken so many people over the years, all of them from that one hospital, in its pursuit of me.  I won’t lie that I’ve struggled with this.  Sometimes, late at night, I think that maybe I should just… stop.  Stop running.  Stop fighting.  That people are dying because of my selfishness.

Tom and his crazy optimism is what keeps me from doing just that.

“Based on what the doctor said before he died, it should only be concerned with you,” Tom said.  “It’s *your* death.  So why is it swallowing up other people?”

“Proximity-” I began, but Tom quickly cut me off.

“Yeah, but was the doctor’s death swallowing up bystanders?  Yours was so much bigger than his, remember?  That’s what he said.  So I think not.  I think this year we need to find out why your death is taking other people.”

I laughed harshly.  I said something sarcastic, I think, about how sure we’ll just stroll up and ask it, I’m not entirely sure.  I was just trying to mask the pounding of my heart and how my mouth went dry at the thought of doing anything other than running and running and running from that void.  Pulling someone out had worked but I was so scared.  So very scared.

“You’ve been inside the void before,” Susan said.  “When you first met me.”

“I try not to think about that,” I muttered.

“But I think that it’s important.  You were at the hospital.  The place where it all started.  You were inside, but it wasn’t pulling you in, and you were able to walk out.”

“No, it tried to drag me back in,” I said uncomfortably.  I really didn’t like thinking about that incident.  I don’t like thinking about any of this, if I’m being perfectly honest.

“Yeah, at the border.  You didn’t like… insta-die.  It kind of makes me wonder if it was the proximity to the hospital.  Like stretching a rubber band - the further you get, the stronger the pull is.”

“So do you think it’ll be easier to escape closer to the hospital?”

I was skeptical, but intrigued.  As it turned out, no, that wasn’t the idea.  Tom had an entirely different plan altogether.

“I think,” Tom said, “we should use the hospital to get a good look around inside the void.”

Our strategy meeting broke up shortly after that because I had a panic attack.  Normally I’d say I had a sorta-panic attack or a quasi-panic attack but both Tom and Susan are nurses and have seen them before and both agreed: I had a panic attack.  Susan also threw around the word “trauma” a few times but we’re going to worry about that when this is all over.

Despite the rocky start, they had all year to convince me.  Though perhaps ‘convince’ isn’t the right word.  It wasn’t like they were trying to coerce me into doing something I didn’t want to.  More like they were presenting a couple different options on how to get through my birthday this year and one of them was a bit more risky than the others.

What finally convinced me though was the other people we saved this year.  Yes.  Plural.

The surprise deaths in the hospital happened at midnight, coinciding with mine.  Maybe, Tom suggested, if I hung around the area the deaths occurred in during that time of night, I could reverse them.  I could pull them out just as the doctor had pulled me out.

I agreed.

We have a twelve minute window.  There’s a coffee shop nearby that’s open until two in the morning and I wait there for their call.  The vast majority of the time, there’s nothing, and twelve minutes after midnight I leave and go home.  But three times this year… three times they’ve called and I’ve sprinted to the hospital.

The first time it was a grandparent, visiting their daughter who had given birth just a few hours prior to midnight.  They were in the hallway.  The team that had responded to try to resuscitate were about to give up.  Tom, standing nearby with his cellphone, was watching me as I approached.  His face was pale and his eyes blazed with determination.  I looked past him, at the inky darkness that yawned just a few yards away, and at the old man that was halfway inside, clawing at the linoleum in a desperate attempt to escape, to drag himself back to his body that lay all too far away from him.

My breath caught in my throat.  That old familiar terror flooded my nose and mouth, a sour taste, and my muscles twitched, ready to turn and run.  To run and run and run because that was all I could do, I was so helpless and no matter how much I ran someday it wouldn’t be enough-

There was a touch on the back of my wrist.

“Go,” Tom breathed.  “*Go.*”

Not to run.  But to go save him.

With shaking legs and a trembling heart, I forced myself to step forward.  One.  Two.  I felt the void pulling at me, like the wind of a storm, drawing me toward it.  The sounds of the hospital, the voice of someone pronouncing the time of death all faded away.  No one noticed me.  It was like I wasn’t there, half a ghost already, floating past them as I confronted my death.

I knelt.  And with trembling hands, I grabbed hold of the old man, and I pulled him back.  I pulled him free and he dissolved and his body gave a gasp, people started yelling, and I slipped away in the commotion as he returned to the life he should never have lost in the first place.

There were two more like this.

And that brings me to tonight.

I want to *live*.  Not just survive.  I have few friends and no family of my own because I’d never allowed myself to commit to anything, knowing that in less than a year it could be gone.  *I’d* be gone.  And it just wasn’t right to make those long-term plans that everyone else got to make, because one day I’d falter and fall and death would swallow me up.  Younger me thought it wouldn’t be fair to make too many people grieve.  Now I know that if my death catches me, it’ll be like I died in that hospital room so many years ago.  I’m not sure which is worse for those left behind - that they are left with my absence, or that they are left with a life rewritten to account for me never having been in it.

Regardless, I am tired of being afraid to plan ahead.  I want to live like I’d have two years, three, maybe even ten after that.  When we saved those three people this year, it was hope dangled in front of me and I snatched at it, finally admitting to myself that I was desperate to actually have a life worth living.

Maybe I didn’t have to run.  Maybe we could figure out why this was happening and reverse it.

Tonight there won’t be running.  I’m going into the void.  Tom and Susan got me close to the room they think I was born in.  When the void opens, I’ll see what’s there.  And then, like Theseus escaping the labyrinth, I’ll follow the rope tied to a climbing harness I’m wearing back to them.

The best part of the plan (according to Tom) is that if I don’t emerge from the edge of the void in time, they’ll just start pulling on the rope.  Considering I escaped via a stairwell last time, I think that sounds like a great way to break my leg, but hey, at least I’ll already be in the hospital, right?

So yeah.  That’s the plan.  I’m hiding out in one of the rooms.  I can barely breath I’m so nervous.  But maybe tonight we’ll find out why this is happening.  I’m going to shut the laptop now and brace myself for the void’s arrival.  I’ll tell you what happened when it’s over… and if I don’t make it… Susan will update you all in my stead.

Wish me luck… and wish me a happy birthday.
