I FOUND THE DOCTOR.

Or rather, he found me.  I think the nurse I was talking to last year had something to do with it.  So… I guess I need to take back all the mental bad-mouthing I was doing after she ghosted me.  Somehow she found out who was there the night I was born, tracked him down, and got my contact info to him.

But before we get into the details of how that all shook out, I should recap.  I’m not going to review *everything* so it might be best if you got caught up if you’re unfamiliar with my situation.

So it’s been a year since I last posted.  A long, painful year of running twice a week, trying to increase my stamina and speed.  The same route, over and over, so that I know every inch of it.  I can’t afford to trip.  I can’t make mistakes.  I see other runners out there and think it would be so nice to just enjoy it as a recreational sport, to run with no fear, and no anguish thinking about the reason behind why I’m doing it.  Like I said… a painful year.

Literally painful.  All that running has given me a stress injury in my hip.  They think it’s a strain.

The timing couldn’t be worse.  It happened a month ago.  My primary care doctor sent me to a specialist and they prescribed physical therapy, explaining that this was the obligatory first step and insurance wouldn’t pay for anything else until we’d exhausted this option, anyway.  I admit I was a little hysterical during the office visit.  I mean, wouldn’t you be, if you were in my situation?  The tears didn’t get me any more immediate fixes, but the doctor did interpret them as meaning I was in considerable pain and gave me a script for the Very Good painkillers.

I took them only a couple days to see just what the side-effects were and how well I could function under their influence.  I’ve saved a dose for tonight.  I don’t care if this will undo weeks of PT.  I have to be able to run through the pain and through the injury.

What choice do I have?  The sight of the void, yawning open behind me, is seared into my mind.  I see the faces of the people trapped inside in my nightmares.  The desperation in their faces.  Their hands, reaching out for me.

For my entire life I’ve been fighting against the void.  I’ve had a lot of thoughts as to what it could be, but I’ve always assumed it was some sort of singular entity.  Death?  Oblivion?  Some other phenomena?  I mean, I’m not ruling those out.  I fear I’ll never know for certain what it is, but the least I can do for myself is figure out which theories are more plausible than others.

I’ve always thought of this as my own personal grim reaper.  It wasn’t because it felt *malevolent*, as any emotion I ascribed to it was merely the result of my own fear.  It’s like a hand around my heart and it’s been there since I was a child, hiding under the covers of my bed and watching the clock tick down to midnight.  Some days in the fall, when the leaves start to turn, it gets so tight that I can hardly breath.

I run.  I just keep running, even though my chest hurts and I want to break down and cry, because if I stop then - during the *practice* run - then I fear I will also stop when it really matters - when it’s my birthday and the void has opened up and is on my heels.

This is probably why I have a running injury right now.

For most of my life I’ve been focused on survival.  All of my planning was for finding better ways to escape the void.  I tried fighting against its pull, I tried using vehicles, and I feel I am running out of options.  Running is my current resort, but I question how long that’s going to last.  Another five years?  Ten?  And then what do I do when that starts to fail?  How do I keep outrunning the oblivion that faces me?

Because as we’ve seen in past years, it just might *be* oblivion.  It took my friend and it was as if she had never existed at all.  I… went to her house.  A few months after she vanished.  Someone else was living there and when I looked at the records online, it had sold only a few weeks after she vanished.  I guess the world just… fills in the gaps when someone is *unmade*.

I always post this before midnight so that you can be updated on what’s happened to me through the year in case I don’t make it.  But I guess that’s rather pointless, isn’t it?  If I don’t make it, all these posts will just vanish like I never existed at all and none of you will remember me.

I’m still here, doing it though.  Posting before midnight.  Maybe I just want to think that some of you are waiting with me.  Hoping that I get out okay, watching the clock like I do and waiting desperately for those twelve minutes after midnight to pass.

It makes me feel less alone.

I think… I’m more afraid this year than I’ve ever been.  It’s not just the injury, either.  I have pain meds to help me through that, after all, and I know I can run on them.  Like I said earlier, I’ve never thought of the void as particularly malevolent or evil.  It simply was.  I fear it, I hate it, I feel like it’s my relentless enemy, trying to drag me into the dark, but these are all reflections of my own emotions.

But last year?  When I held up the mirror and *saw* what those hands are?

I fear *them*.  All those people that died in that hospital, trying to drag me in with them.  Because I think they’re growing older just as I’m growing older and for some of them at least, the ones that died as infants, they’re growing stronger.

Maybe I’m about to get some answers, though.  The doctor that slipped the note to my parents contacted me.  I think the nurse I’d been talking to was asking around the hospital to find out the story behind why patients tended to die in that one area and he must have heard about it and started looking for me.  And well, he found these posts.  So he messaged me and he wants to talk.

Yes, future tense.  He wants to talk *tonight*.  In the time leading up to midnight.

I’ve tried to talk him out of it.  But he’s been insistent - says he knows what he’s asking for and would have it no other way.  He assures me that we’ll wrap up our conversation prior to midnight and I’ll be free to go on my way to outrun the void on my own.  He’s even sent me photos of the street outside his house to prove that it’s clear and doesn’t present tripping hazards.  Which all seems rather accommodating, right, except for the fact *he’s asking me to meet him right before the void that eats anyone in its path opens up*.

I got plane tickets.  I got a hotel.  And… I almost canceled on him anyway.  I was sitting there in the hotel room earlier today, looking at the address that he’d given me on my phone and thinking that there’s no good reason for him to want to meet me so close to midnight.  He *knows* what’s going to happen.  I started getting angry.  My predicament wasn’t something to be examined out of curiosity.  He could die.  I could die.

A familiar tightness took hold of my chest.  Then I saw something move in the corner of my eye, something dark, something that’s seared into my brain.  There, in the mirror, an empty gulf of nothingness and I heard a roaring in my ears and I thought - I swear - I heard voices.  Calling for me.

I jerked backwards, throwing myself across the bed towards the door.  I was panicked and uncoordinated.  I fell instead, slamming into the wall of the hotel room.  And when I stumbled to my feet, reeling, my gaze fell onto the mirror.

Nothing.  Nothing at all.

I called the doctor.  I asked him if he really understood what he was getting himself into.  I guess my voice was still shaking.

“You didn’t go to the hospital, did you?” he asked sharply.

I told him that no, I was at the hotel.  He heaved an audible sigh of relief.

“I thought it’d come for you,” he said.  “Don’t go back there.  Ever.  Are you still going to come by tonight?”

Yes.  I told him yes.

He’s as scared as I am… which means he knows something.

I’m actually posting this from inside my rental car just outside his house.  Typed it all up in advance and just copy/pasting it from my phone.

I’m going to go inside now.  I’ll update as soon as I can.

Think of me, if you would, until I update you with my success or you forget I even existed.

Hey.  Hi.  I’m here.  I’m alive.  
  
I’m still processing wtf happened.  
  
The doctor wasn’t some weird kidnapper or cultist or anything like that.  Believe me, I had a lot of theories of how this could all go horribly wrong.  Desperation makes us take stupid risks.  But no, he was exactly as he said he was - a doctor that knew about the situation I’m in.  
  
He was waiting for me at the door when I walked up to his house.  I noticed that he left the door unlocked after I came in and at no point did he get between me and an easy exit.  This was deliberate, I’m sure.  He was making sure I understood that I could bail at any moment, that he wasn’t going to hold me there when the void came for me.  I was free to leave.  To run.   
  
And just as the photos had shown, his street really was perfectly flat and clear for running on.  I’d taken the pain meds before walking inside so they’d kick in just in time for my run.  It seemed like everything was going to be okay, even with my lingering suspicions as to why he wanted to meet at this time.  
  
He told me a little bit about himself as he led the way to the kitchen.  He’d been a doctor at the same hospital for most of his career.  He wasn’t the doctor that delivered me.  He wasn’t involved in my birth in any way, he said.  He just happened to be passing by when I died.  
  
There were two chairs at the table.  He sat at the one up against the wall, leaving the one with a clear shot to the front door to me.  I hesitated for a moment, even though my nerves were screaming at me that every second counted here.  That we didn’t have much time left.  Behind him, just over his right shoulder, was a big grandfather clock.  I glanced at my watch just to confirm that it was set accurately - I suppose he’d adjusted it just prior to my arrival, for it was correct down to the second.  
  
And behind my chair was a large standing mirror.    
  
Uneasily, I sat down, for he was waiting quietly at the table, refusing to speak until I was in front of the mirror.  
  
“How did I die?” I asked, sitting sideways in the chair, unwilling to fully commit to being present at the table.  
  
“No one knows,” he replied.  “It’s not like we did an autopsy, after all, since you came back.”  
  
“And how did I come back?  The nurse I talked to says that lots of people have died in that room.”  
  
“They have.  Do you want to know my theory as to why that is?”  
  
“I want to know everything.”  
  
He said there are currents to death.  It ebbs and flows and sometimes it becomes eddies in places of horrific tragedy.  Whether it’s in response to what is happening in our world or if it’s the catalyst, he’s not sure.  But in that hospital… in that room… it’s become a whirlpool.  
  
“I saw it when I first started working there,” he said, “when someone died in that room.  At the time the area was a surgical suite.  I guess it saw its share of death in its time, before they tore it all out and remodeled it into the maternity center.  Even that didn’t last though… it’s just regular patient rooms now.”  
  
He preempted my question, which would be what made this surgical suite so special that it would create a vortex.  Honestly, he said, he wasn’t sure it was anything special.  Might have just been a coincidence - perhaps whatever currents there are in the world were particularly strong in that area even before the hospital was built.  The surgical suite had its share of difficulties, after all.  There would be strange malfunctions in the room - cauterizers would short out when they were needed to seal off a bleeding vessel, lights would go out at critical moments.  There was even a fire, once, which is particularly dangerous with all the pure oxygen around.  When a donor dropped a bunch of money on the hospital, they jumped at the chance to build a new surgical wing onto the building.  
  
But by then it was too late.  He felt the pull of the vortex whenever he walked down that hallway.  A light touch, like someone putting a hand on his shoulder, but he knew what it was.  He knew that if perhaps he got too close, that it would pull him in.  For a long time he simply avoided that part of the hospital entirely.  
  
My eyes darted to the clock.  Fifteen minutes left.  I ached to ask questions, but I thought it would be better to let him continue with his story and not interrupt.  Every second counted.  
  
Then one day he felt the current brush past him, cold as ice, and he felt compelled to follow it.  He’s thought long about that day and still hasn’t decided why he did that.  It just felt like he needed to be there.  And when he arrived at the maternity ward, there was a commotion, for a baby wasn’t breathing.  
  
At the center of it all, the vortex gaped open, ready to swallow up the life it had just claimed for itself.  
  
“I reached in,” he said, “and pulled you out just as I was pulled out.”  
  
I could hear the clock ticking behind us with perfect clarity.  It was deafening in the silence that ensued between us.  Dutifully ticking down the seconds until midnight.  
  
“You pulled me out,” I said dumbly.  
  
“I don’t think other people can do this,” he said, staring at his hands.  “Just people like you and me, who have been saved in turn.  I don’t know how far back this goes or how it started.  I was eight years old when I ran out into the street and was hit by a car.  That’s when I died.  The driver pulled me out and then drove off before anyone could ask any questions.”  
  
He raised his gaze to stare at me intently.  
  
“It gets harder after you pull your first one out,” he said.  “It’s like death notices you.  It is no longer indifferent.  It wants retribution for what was stolen from it.  You’re the only person I saved… because I didn’t think I could afford to save anyone else.”  
  
Five minutes left.  I needed to leave.  I needed to let my lungs get adjusted to the cold air outside.  
  
“Please stay,” he said, noticing how my gaze darted to the door.  “I won’t stop you - but please stay.  I want to see what you run from.  See if it’s the same thing I run from.”  
  
Now I understood why he’d set up a mirror behind my chair.  He knew exactly what would happen tonight, because it happened to him.  
  
“I’m sorry,” I said, standing.  “I’m barely outrunning it as it is.”  
  
“But you don’t have to outrun it if it swallows someone else, right?  I read that in your posts.”  
  
I froze.  Surely he wasn’t proposing… surely he wouldn’t…  
  
“Look at me,” he said.  “I’m tired.  I’m old - older than you’d guess.  I think it’s time.  And if I can answer some of my questions before I die, then I think I’ll be happy.”  
  
No, I protested.  I had so many more questions.  But he remained resolute, telling me that if it wasn’t my void that dragged him in, then it would be his own, when it came for him in the new year.  He’d told me everything he knew.  There was nothing left.  
  
And something popped into my head, a single question that made me pause even though the minutes were winding down and I was running out of time.  
  
How had he survived this long, if he was running from his own death?  How did he make it to old age?  
  
So I stood there, waiting, because he would not answer me.  And I was willing to take any risk to answer that question.  To know how to survive.  I could run after I knew, I reasoned.  After he told me what was different about what followed me, why it was so hard that I doubted I had that many years left to me.  
  
Midnight.  And this time, I watched in disbelief as the portal opened behind him instead of me.  
  
“I see,” he murmured, his gaze fixed on the mirror.  “I suppose I get priority, since I eluded it for longer.”  
  
I watched in horror as those shadows stretched out their arms, reaching for the doctor sitting calmly at the table.  Ghostly hands stretched out their hands, their fingertips almost brushing the back of his head.  
  
“Please tell me how you survived this long,” I sobbed.  “I can’t do this forever.”  
  
A faint, sad smile crossed his lips.  He hadn’t moved at all, even though surely he must feel the hands that were wrapping their fingers around his shoulders and neck.  His eyes glistened as he stared up at me, finally tearing his gaze away from the mirror.  
  
“I’m sorry,” he said.  “I don’t think I can help you any more.  The death that follows you… it’s so much bigger than mine.  It’s swallowed up so many more people.”  
  
He stood, ignoring the hands that were wrapped around his arms and legs.  Pulling him backwards into their embrace.  I was frozen in place, too afraid to reach out a hand and pull him away from them.  My skin crawled at the thought of their ghostly hands around my limbs, dragging me towards oblivion.  I couldn’t save both of us.  
  
“Well,” he amended absently.  “I can’t help you any more than this one last thing, I suppose.  Happy birthday.”  
  
Then he stepped backwards, into the void, the shadows swarmed over him, and then he - and my death - were gone.  
  
And I stood there, staring at where he’d been, crying silently, until the clock rolled around to twelve minutes after midnight.  
  
He’s gone.  Erased, all the way back to his childhood when he should have died and stayed dead.  If there were journals, they’re gone.  If he had notes on the phenomena, they are no longer here.  I feel sick at the thought of how much could have been lost.  
  
Or perhaps this is all he knows.  He might have spent his whole life trying to ignore it, until he decided he couldn’t let it swallow that tiny infant up and did something about it.  And this last conversation was how he passed what little he knows along to me, so that I’d remember it, because I’m the only person that can remember that he existed.  
  
He bought me another year.  One more year to run from death.  
  
I’ll see you all next December.
