[The third year I posted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rkfi97/i_was_born_twelve_minutes_after_midnight/)

I thought I was going to make progress this year.  That I was approaching this from a different angle and that maybe I’d figure out what was happening and find some real solutions.  There are limits, after all, to how fast I can run.  I can train and train all year (and I hate every minute of it) but at some point, I’m going to hit a wall.

And then the death that chases me will catch up.

Okay, I should back up a bit and recap I suppose.  I was born twelve minutes after midnight.  At least, that’s what my birth certificate says.  The year before last my parents told me the truth.  I was whisked away after my birth and then returned to them later.  Everything was fine, they were told.  Everything was just fine.

Then the doctor slipped them a note with a death certificate that he’d started to fill out.  Midnight.  My parents weren’t exactly watching the clock when I was born, so they didn’t know when I’d been born.  Midnight?  Twelve minutes after?  Did it really matter?  I was there, I was healthy, I was alive.

Except… it does matter.  It matters very much.

At midnight, the void opens up.  It comes for me.  It stretches out greedy hands and tries to drag me inside.  Then, twelve minutes later, it vanishes.

As a child, I fought it off, alone in my bedroom,  clawing to drag myself out of its grip so that I might live another year.  Now, as an adult, I outrun it.  But even then… I wonder how long that will last.  Because as I’ve gotten older, it’s gotten stronger.  Strong enough that if those hands manage to grasp hold of me, I don’t think I could tear myself from their grip.  I don’t know how many years I have left until it’s too fast for me to keep ahead of it.

I think when I find that answer out, it’ll be too late.

So I’m searching for an answer as to why this is happening.

I don’t have many leads.  My parents are blissfully unaware that anything was abnormal about my birth, other than what they’ve already told me.  I’m not sure any help they could provide would be worth the pain of telling them, so I’ve let them retain their ignorance.

Besides, if the void *does* catch me someday, it’ll be like I never existed.  That’s what happened to my friend, when I took her running with me.  The void ate her up; body, soul, and history.  It was like she’d never existed at all.  My parents won’t have to grieve me once I’m gone, so why make them suffer while I’m still alive?

I still regret what happened to my friend. What if my parents want to help?  What if they insist on being here for me?  What if the void takes one of them?

Losing one person was bad enough.  I can’t do that again.  I can’t.  It’s just me, up against the abyss.

I do have one ally though.  Or an informant, rather?  I’m not sure.  Last year, I went to the hospital where I was born.  I met a nurse there who admitted there was something *strange* about the area of the hospital where I was delivered, before it was remodeled and turned into patient rooms.  We’ve been keeping in touch this year, mostly via text.  I told her everything I knew about what’s happening to me and I think that was my mistake.

Much like my friend, I think it was too much.  I need to think of a better lie, I suppose.  She started answering her texts less frequently and around the fall, I started getting no responses at all.  I was hoping she could find the doctor that delivered me.  He has a common enough name that I haven’t been able to find him through my own limited resources, but surely hospital records have a long enough memory that she could locate something that’d give me a clue as to his whereabouts.  Failing that, I was hoping she could maybe, I dunno, put me in touch with anyone else that nearly died in that part of the hospital.

She’d said that they only put stable patients in those rooms now, because everyone else tends to just… die.  But what about patients with near misses?  Surely I wasn’t the only one that came back, right?  At least, that’s what I was selfishly hoping for.  I just want someone else who is going through this so I’m not so alone.  Someone I can talk to about what works and what doesn’t, someone who might have some answers on how I can keep living for years to come.

I’m tired of dreading my birthday.  I’m tired of fighting and running for my life.

Unfortunately, I think asking for patient information was a bit too far for the nurse.  She stopped replying to me entirely and I realized belatedly that I’d probably crossed a line asking for that information.  It made me angry at first.  This was important.  My life was literally on the line here.  Hadn’t she seen me fall out of literal mid-air where I hadn’t been before, when I was clawing my way out of the void the previous year?  Wasn’t that enough to make her realize how damn serious this all was?

I was even thinking of going so far as to show up at the hospital and demand to know why she wasn’t helping me.  I’d figured out what plane tickets to buy and was ready to order them (admittedly it was very late at night and I’d had a drink or two) when I realized that I was bordering on being a stalker.  (is that the right word here? You know what, don’t tell me if it is, and don’t tell me what I was being if it isn’t, I don’t want to know)

“But it’s my life at stake!”  That’s the justification I wanted to use.

Y-es but I’m trying to balance twelve minutes of running for my life with… the rest of it.  What’s the point of winning the race if I destroy everything else I’ve worked for by doing something immoral or illegal?  Because giving out private patient information IS illegal and it IS wrong to demand someone compromise their morality.  I desperately want to live and keep living, but I can’t lose sight of a *good* life in the process.

Besides, that one thought is sitting in the back of my head and whispering to me.  The void gave up when it took my friend.  What if I just… find a populated area to be in when midnight rolls around every year?  No one would ever know because whoever the void claimed would cease to exist.  It would be so. very. easy.

I closed the web browser and decided to find a different way.  A better way.  One that didn’t involve bullying some poor nurse that probably doesn’t entirely believe me into violating her own code of ethics and committing crimes.

I texted her back saying that yeah, I understood, I was just getting a little desperate because I was running out of ideas.  I asked if she could maybe try to find out what happened to the doctor that delivered me instead and if anything else weird happened that she could share, maybe let me know?

Then I set all that aside because I needed to focus on my preparations.  My birthday was only a month away.  I’ve been running all year, of course, so I had to reassure myself that I’d prepared for my race as best as I possibly could and stop worry about that particular problem.  I’d already done everything I could.

However, I only get one chance a year to learn more about what’s happening to me and I had to figure out how to make the best of this opportunity.

I admit I’m not thrilled with my preparations.  I feel like I’m grasping at straws.  But with every other lead quickly turning into dead ends, I figure that’s all I’ve got left to me.  I have a camera that I’m going to wear pointing backwards.  I’m not entirely trusting of technology though.  It doesn’t have the right symbolism, I feel, and besides, aren't there stories of cameras and stuff just going ‘nope’ when confronted with something unnatural?

So I got the nerdiest running accessory known to humankind.

It’s a rear-view mirror.

That’s attached to a wristband.

I don’t *dare* look behind me.  Too much could go wrong.  I might trip or I might slow down - either of those mistakes or any like them would be fatal.  And after last year, after being inside that endless expanse of utter nothingness, I am perhaps even more frightened of being dragged in there than I was in the past.

Because I keep thinking - what if it’s not death trying to drag me back?  What if it’s just.. the void?  Maybe I was supposed to die at birth but I didn’t and I’ve been living on borrowed time and the void wants that time *back*.  And I’ll sit in there with nothing, absolutely *nothing*, until I’ve paid my dues.  Or perhaps death has nothing to with this *at all* and the death certificate was filled out because the doctors didn’t know how else to explain it and the void is just *taking* people, swallowing them up whole.

I have nothing upon which to base those fears.  My head is probably running a bit wild, to be honest, and needs to be brought into check.  But these are the kinds of thoughts that have been keeping me awake at night for the past two months.

It’s been a rough year.

There’s nothing I can do about my fears though.  They’re coming for me and there’s nothing I can do to stop it.

I need to stop typing and get ready.  I’ve got my route picked out, a nice even street with smooth pavement, well-lit, and quite deserted at this time of night.  I should get my running gear on and head over.  If this is where the post stops… well, you know I didn’t run fast enough.
