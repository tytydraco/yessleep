I am 79 year old man who lives alone. I don't live a particullarly lavish life, and to say the truth, I do not really care after everything I have lived through. All I want is to be able to wake up everyday without being forced to my feet by recurring night terrors that have my clothes drenched in sweat and my bones threatening to shake out of their sockets. I am an army veteran. I served in the army for a good 25 years. I was 18 when I got packed up and shipped to serve in the Vietnam War in 1963. The things I have seen could make even serial killers do a double take. The things I have experienced are in another realm alone. I would love to just live a comfortable life and have nothing to do all day except listen to the radio and sit on my balcony, taking in the welcoming sun and caressing breeze. But I cannot. They will not let me. 

Ever since my wife died last year from breast cancer, everything has changed. They finally *revealed* themselves, those little bastards. Monsters. All around. Slimy, shadowy, *creeping* creatures, that want nothing else but to tear out my eyes for even sparing a glimpse at them. They are everywhere. Everywhere. I do not understand why people cannot see them. Only I can. When I walk down the street. At the mall. Even in my own damn home! I can't get rid of them and it drives me half way to insanity. I even got a dog to try and ward them off. A German Shephard. Vicious little thing it is. Fur as dark as dirt and eyes that seem to *see*. Analyze. Everything watches me. Even my own damn dog.

My family is coming over today. It is my birthday. At least that is what they said. Sometimes the monsters like to mess with my calendar and move my keys and belongings around. I will scour my whole house to find where I- *they* have placed my stuff. My radio, most of all. Bastards always love hiding it and laughing while I desperately tear my house apart from ground to ceiling searching for it. Curious thing is it's always on my balcony where I frequently sit and listen to on it. I just can't seem to remember. They just enjoy watching me struggle.

I am getting off topic. My family is coming over today. It is my birthday. I have a beautiful daughter, a pesky son in law, and an even lovelier niece. Unfortunately my wife passed from breast cancer last year. They are my joy in this darkness of a life. I need to make sure everything perfect. Perfect for them. I grab my cane and let out a small grunt as I push to my feet, slowly pacing over to my kitchen island. I sigh, looking at the multitude of papers scattered like leaves over a driveway on my table. One arm propped over my cane, I begin sorting through them. Bills. Bills. Bills. Prescription for something called Donepezil. Hm. Can't seem to recall that. I toss them all in my garbage, not bothering enough to go to the garage and place them in the recycling. That's when I notice it. One of *Them*. 

A snarling, mangled creature, hunched over my kitchen floor. I stumbled back, my breath catching in my throat and threatening to choke me like ghastly hands wrapped around my neck. The thing was medium sized and and brown, almost as dark as dirt. Blood leaked out of its jaw, gaping white eyes staring at me from behind a bloodied snout. It was horrifying. Limbs far too long for its stubby body, and bent at various, painful angles as to accommodate its form. They look pale brown, a soft layer of what could be comparable to the hairs of a spider up close covering its body. I let out a small curse and grabbed my cane, slamming it against the creatures body once. The thing let out a whimper, almost like an animal begging for mercy. Mercy for a monster. It was almost laughable. The pathetic being let out an almost inaudible growl and stalked backwards, it's limbs twisting and turning at angles like cogs in a clock to push it back. I used that opportunity wisely.

I hobbled over to my living room before slamming the closet door open with so much force I was surprised the door didn't come of it's hinges. That's what years in the military and a junk load of adrenaline does to you. I looked inside and snapped my head from side to side, searching for the one thing I needed. My shotgun. I was sure I left it here. Certain, even. But if I am honest, I cannot remember the last time I had used it. I let out a flurry of curses. Damned creatures! They must've moved it as a pitiful attempt of a joke. I stumbled to my room, willing my feet to move faster, harder, *quicker*. The creature ran to me, nipping at my heels just as I turned the corner straight to my room and wacked the door shut with all my might. My gun. I need my shotgun. I frantically paced around the room, overturning pillows and crashing lamps in my craze to find it. Where is it? WHERE IS MY SHOT-. Ah. There it is. A beauty. I pushed myself over using my cane and grabbed ahold of it. Even after so many years, the indent of where my hand placement is and the steady feel of the cool metal against my fingers is more than enough to ground me. To give me the confidence I need to kill whatever that thing behind my door is.

I roll my shoulders and let out a small sigh before whistling. "Archie! Archie, come here!" I call out. My dogs name is Archie. Or was it Max? Maybe Archie was the last one. I listen for the tell tale sound of scratching footsteps coming my way before taking a deep breath. Good. Archie- Max- Dog. Dog will be a good sacrifice. Better him than me. Or was it a girl? I wait until the footsteps stop in front of my door before slamming it open and aiming at the deformed monster still perched in front of my bedroom door. Blood coated it's unhinged jaw. It had eaten my cat. A well sacrifice, all in all. Not giving myself a moments leeway, I cocked the shotgun and fired off, straight between the animals hollow eyes. *BANG!* For a moment I swear I saw something like betrayal flash through the beings eyes, but monsters are not capable of anything of the sort. It fell to the ground in a pool of its own miserable blood, left to die an equally miserable death.

Good. Perfect. Amazing! I killed it! I *killed* one of them! I cannot be defeated. Now I get it. Now I get it all. I am the only one capable of seeing these monsters because I am the only one able to kill them! I have a duty bestowed on me. An honorable one I will take without hesitation. These things are nothing more than pathetic creatures trying and failing to mimick our life forms. I can do this. I am the chosen one. *Knock Knock Knock*. I look over to my front door. Another knock, this one louder. If knocks could have emotions, this one would portray panick. Kicking the still bleeding monster aside, I grabbed my cane and sauntered over to the front door, my cane hitting the ground with a rhythmic thump. I cock my shotgun again. Better safe than sorry. And I open the door.

Another monster. This one much, much taller than the one I just killed. If I can put a gender to it, I would say it be female. It is wearing a blue floral dress, much like the one I bought for my daughter for her birthday last year. Unfiltered rage consumed me. Had this *beast* killed my daughter and come here to do the same to me? *Me*?! Hah! As if I can allow that. I aim the shotgun at the beasts heart, or where I assume it's heart would be. Fear, betrayal, and sadness all flicker over the things face. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe they do have some semblance of emotion. I don't care either way. *BANG*. And the creature falls to the ground, bleeding the same as the last one did. A cry filled of pure rage and agony assaults my ears, and I look over to find another creature, this one appearing to be male, sprinting over to the body of the person I just killed. Wait..person? No. Monster. I have one last shell. Cock shotgun. Aim. Right in the middle of his chest. A certain shot. *He looks too human in this moment.* And fire! He collapses to the floor, immediately lifeless like the other two. I don't feel victory. I feel pain. So much pain. But, why?

"Grandpa...?" A small, child voice calls out. I slowly look over and come face to face with my niece, standing above the corpse of her....no. It is not possible. 
"MOM! DAD!" She screams.
No. It is not real. They are monsters. I am helping. They are man eating creatures. So why...? 

**Why are those the bodies of my nieces parents?**
