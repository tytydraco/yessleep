In the depths of darkness, where fear takes hold and the mind plays tricks, there exists a tale of a chilling encounter that would haunt even the bravest of souls and an experience that would shatter the psyche of any mortal. That tale was my own, I share it with you now having spent countless hours reading the same tales in this forum and hope someone will be able to help. My name is Adam and have lived in Cental Arkansas pretty much my whole life. I feel no need to change this information rather if you don’t hear from me again then I guess you could call this my last testament. This took place almost a month ago to the day, I had just gotten home from spending some time with my little brother and my nephew. I had always believed in the paranormal as well as being deeply spiritual, having studied every kind of spiritual teaching I could from all parts of the world. Though I had never experienced anything to this magnitude.  
   
 I have stayed with my grandmother ever since my grandfather and uncle both passed away. I know some people have mixed thoughts about that, but I couldn’t care less. I pulled in front of the house and got out. My grandmothers minivan sitting under awning where it always sits. Walking up to the door was the first time I got the feeling something wasn’t right. There were no lights on inside, normally at least the living room is lit up with my grandmother sitting in her chair watching T.V. Maybe she was in the shower, I thought as I made my way inside. 

As soon as I stepped inside that thought was pushed to the very back of my mind. Every light was off, it was cold but not just a chill. This is the kind of cold you only find in desolate, empty, and dangerous places. A cold I had never felt before and hope never to again.  Alone in the house, I ascended the stairs, unaware of the terror that awaited. As I reached the top, my heart skipped a beat, at the end of the hall, stood a towering figure, cloaked in shadow. Frozen in place, my mind raced, unable to understand the sight before me.  
   
The shadow figure, with an eerie grace, began to move closer, its form becoming clearer with each step. Panic gripped me tightly, my fight or flight nonexistent. What in the actual fuck, like seriously. All I could do was stand there, paralyzed, as a fear I have never known coursed through my being, threatening to consume my sanity. A bone-chilling whisper filled the air, echoing through the desolate house. 

The voice seemed to emanate from the depths of the shadow figure itself, weaving its way into my mind with sinister intent. Its words were incomprehensible, a twisted mélange of ancient tongues, clicks, and hissing that sent shivers down my spine. As the figure drew nearer, its features slowly materialized, revealing a gaunt and twisted visage. Its eyes, devoid of any humanity, gleamed an icy shade of blue, piercing through the darkness with an otherworldly glow. Jagged, elongated fingers extended from its spindly limbs, reaching out for me longingly.  
  
An almost visible aura surrounded the figure, exuding a malefic energy that corrupted the very air I struggled to breathe. It was as if the very essence of evil had taken form, its presence suffusing the environment, suffocating any hope that remained. I desperately longed to escape, to flee from this nightmare, but my body remained rooted to the spot, as if bound by an unseen force. Fuck this, this can't be real I thought, I know this shit happens but not to someone like me.   
  
All  thought abandoned me, replaced by a primal instinct to survive. I pleaded to the universe, to any divine entity that would listen, praying for deliverance from this unspeakable horror. But my pleas fell on deaf ears as the figure closed in, suddenly the silence was deafeningly loud in my ears.  
  
A gust of wind swept across the hallway, slamming the still open front door, extinguishing the feeble light that had permeated the area. Darkness cradled me, wrapping around my body like a tangible entity. In the abyss, I could sense the figure's impending presence, its loathsome breath brushing against my face, as I tried to shrink in on myself. I am fucked its over.  
  
Time ceased to have meaning as the figure finally stood before me, I could feel its gaze bore into my very soul, devouring any remnants of courage or hope that remained. The air grew heavy with anticipation, as if the world itself held its breath, waiting for the impending doom that hung in the balance.  
  
With a chilling whisper, the figure finally spoke, its voice a haunting symphony of despair but also something else I couldn’t place at the time. "I'm truly sorry for what you will experience," it hissed, with nothing but sincerity and understanding on its ghastly countenance. Just as soon as I was sure this lifetime was over for me, it was gone. Literally one second I'm looking right into its eyes and the next nothing. All the lights are on, there's sound coming from the t.v. in the living room. What do you want for supper my grandmother called.   
  
Obviously she hadn't experienced anything similar to what I had. Ok it owned a consciousness, and not just the evil of an unknown world that I first imagined. Questions raced through my mind, but answers eluded them. What was this entity? A spirit? A demon? Something far more sinister from the depths of a Lovecraftian nightmare?   


Was it even real? Did I truly see such a terrifying apparition? Doubt gnawed at my sanity, but the lingering fear in my heart spoke volumes. I was not alone in the house; something supernatural had crossed my path. With no plan in place, I grappled with the overwhelming uncertainty of how to protect myself from an entity so enigmatic and powerful. The fear of the unknown gripped me tightly, I felt vulnerable and exposed. In the aftermath of this haunting encounter, I was changed. The memory of that shadow figure continues to haunt my thoughts, a constant reminder of the existence of forces beyond comprehension.  
 

For in the realm of the supernatural, where shadows dance and nightmares take form, the line between reality and the unknown blurs. And in the face of such horrors, all one can do is confront their fears, seek solace in the light, and hope to never again be left alone with the terrors that lurk in the darkness. IF only I could be so lucky. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Does anyone have any ideas and what did it mean? Help Please? I don’t know how I know, if it's some divine intuition or a gift of foresight but I know that it will be back.  


I was trying to find a way to rid the house of the shadow entity, but I had to know what I was dealing with; someone had suggested just asking out loud for the presence to leave my home. With nothing else to lose I decided to try it and see. I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what might come next. Standing in the dimly lit room, I mustered all the courage I could find within me and spoke into the silent, eerie air, "Shadow entity, if you can hear me, I ask you to kindly leave my home. This is my sanctuary, and I wish for your presence to depart."  
   
For a moment, the room remained still, and my heart raced with anticipation. Then, a sudden gust of wind swept through the house, rattling the windows and extinguishing the candles. The atmosphere grew colder, causing a shiver to run down my spine. I wondered if my actions had angered the entity, or if it had decided to defy my plea.  
   
Just as doubt began to cloud my mind, I heard a faint whisper coming from the darkness. "Why should I leave?" a chilling voice echoed, sending chills down my spine. "I have been here long before you arrived and nothing will keep me from my purpose"  
   
Fear gripped me tightly, but I refused to show weakness. I took a step forward and spoke with a trembling yet determined voice, "I understand that you've been here, but I am the rightful owner of this domain now. I seek peace within these walls, not fear and uncertainty. Please, let us coexist peacefully or find solace elsewhere."  
   
Silence lingered for what felt like an eternity, suffocating the room. Then, a subtle shift occurred, as if the air itself held its breath. The oppressive presence gradually diminished, and with each passing moment, the tension eased. The entity seemed to consider my words. Suddenly I couldn’t breathe, and I was levitating off the ground. Clawing at my throat and kicking, thrashing, it didn’t do any good at all. I was helpless and there was nothing I could do.  “There will be no peace until my purpose if fulfilled, our paths are entwined now.” What was this thing talking about before I could even think to reply I dropped to the floor coughing and choking in air. Shaking with tears streaming from my eyes. It wasn’t going to leave so easily.  
  
The next night started off like any other, peaceful and serene. The moon hung low in the sky, casting a soft glow over the neighborhood. I was about to drift off to sleep when I felt it, a presence, something unnatural lurking in the darkness. My heart raced as I sat up in bed, instinctively drawing the covers tighter around me. In the corner of my room, the shadow shifted and took form, slowly materializing into the figure of a woman. She was dressed all in black, her features obscured by a hood that cast a menacing shadow over her face. The air around her seemed to crackle with an unseen energy. I knew without a doubt that it was the same shadow entity that had haunted me before. My breath came in short, ragged gasps as I struggled to find the words to speak.  
  
"Wh-who are you?" I managed to stammer; my voice barely audible over the pounding of my heart. The shadow figure cocked its head to the side, studying me with unblinking eyes. For a fleeting moment, I thought I saw a flicker of sympathy cross its features. "I'm truly sorry for what you will experience," it whispered, its voice like the rustling of dead leaves in the wind. "But it is necessary." What was it talking about, it sounded just like the shaman talking about destiny. I create my life, anything that I experience ultimately is because of choices that I had made previously. Maybe that is exactly what is happening here, perhaps I have angered some God or force that I wasn't even aware of somehow. The shadow figure continued, "The end of this world draws near. The fabric of reality is weakening, and the void presses in upon us. It is a time of great change, of turmoil and suffering. You, mortal, are but a grain of sand in the hourglass. Your fate is intertwined with that of this world, and you shall bear witness to its destruction." The weight of its words pressed down upon me, making it difficult to breathe. I didn't know whether to believe this shadow entity or not, but the certainty in its voice left me shaken.  
  
I swallowed thickly, my mouth dry. "Is there anything I can do? Anything to stop it?" I asked, my voice trembling. The shadow figure shook its head slowly. "I am sorry, mortal. There is nothing you can do. The path has been set, and we must all follow it to the end." Its hooded head bowed, as if in prayer or resignation. I didn't know what to say. I felt helpless and alone in the face of such an overwhelming fate. As if sensing my despair, the shadow figure lifted its head once more, its features twisted into a cruel smile. "But fear not, mortal. For in the depths of darkness, there is always light. And though the world may end, there will always be those who carry on the torch of hope." Its words offered little comfort, but I clung to them, nonetheless.  
  
"There must be a way to stop it," I pleaded, my voice hoarse from desperation. "Some way to save everyone." The shadowy figure standing before me shook its head, its featureless mask casting an unsettling silence over the room. "I am sorry, mortal," it said softly. "The end has come, and there is no escape from the void that awaits." Its words sent a shiver down my spine. "But" it continued, "there is a way to hold off the void for a time, but you cannot accomplish it alone. Even with the other incarnated. The other incarnated, what was he talking about now? Before I could ask, he continued. “There is a journal in the attic it belonged to a man named Josiah, he used to dwell in this home as well. He also thought that it could be stopped, any answers you seek can be found there.”    
  
There actually was a trunk in the attic from the previous owner, it was full of loose papers, a few trinkets and a journal. Apparently, the previous owner had been communicating with someone or something. It told of 5 places where the void first laid claim to this reality and where its hold is strongest. I will translate here word for word.    
  
Once upon a time, in a realm far beyond human comprehension, there existed an enigmatic entity known as Zephyrus. Zephyrus hailed from a plane of existence where darkness and light intertwined, where secrets whispered in the wind and mysteries danced in the shadows. With a mischievous glint in its otherworldly eyes, Zephyrus decided to reveal five unique and dark secrets to the world, secrets that would send shivers down the spines of even the bravest souls.  
  
   
  
1. The Vanishing Whispers: In the darkest corners of the world, there exists a phenomenon known as the Vanishing Whispers. These whispers, barely audible to human ears, carry secrets from forgotten realms. But beware, for those who dare to listen too closely may find themselves slowly fading from reality, their existence erased with each passing whisper.  
  
   
  
2. The Mirror of Reflection: Deep within an ancient forest lies a mystical mirror, known as the Mirror of Reflection. Gazing into its depths reveals not one's true self, but rather the darkest desires and fears hidden within. Many have been consumed by their own reflections, trapped forever in a twisted version of themselves.  
  
   
  
3. The Cursed Labyrinth: Hidden beneath the shifting sands of a desolate desert lies the Cursed Labyrinth. Its walls whisper ancient incantations, luring unsuspecting wanderers into its treacherous depths. Once trapped within, the labyrinth toys with their minds, distorting reality and driving them to the brink of madness.  
  
   
  
4. The Forgotten Library: Within the depths of a forgotten city, a library stands untouched by time. Its shelves hold tomes of forbidden knowledge, each page filled with secrets that could unravel the very fabric of existence. But beware, for those who delve too deeply into its forbidden texts risk losing their sanity, as the knowledge within consumes them.  
  
   
  
5. The Veil of Shadows: At the stroke of midnight, when the moon is at its zenith, a veil of shadows descends upon the world. In this ethereal darkness, creatures of nightmares roam freely, feasting on the fears of mortals. Only the bravest souls can navigate this treacherous realm, for those who succumb to their own terror become trapped forever, lost in an eternal nightmare.  
  
   
  
As Zephyrus revealed these five dark and terrifying mysteries, a sense of foreboding filled the air. Yet, amidst the darkness, a glimmer of hope remained. For in the face of these sinister secrets, there were those who dared to seek the truth, to challenge the void. The incarnated souls of my brothers, they are now human and remember nothing of their previous existence. They hold the power to close the vortexes at the mystery sites.    
  
This has to be what the entity was referring to but how would I go about finding them? Would they even believe me or care? What do you guys think I should do?
