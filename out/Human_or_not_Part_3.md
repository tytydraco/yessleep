Dave grabbed Tracey and opened its mouth wide open. I had to do something fast or Tracey would die , So I stabbed the egg in its eye. 


Dave turned around and looked at me and the egg, It released Tracey and started charging towards me.


I rolled out of the way but it wasn't going for me , It took the egg in its arms and started making a noise that sounded like....crying.


I silently went to Tracey's side , He was looking at Dave.


"You barely survived that one huh" I whispered to him.


Dave suddenly turned around looking at me , Now his hollow eyes overflowing with tears of blood. It....was mad.


"Do you think it's mad at m-"


Tracey grabbed my arm before I could finish and bolted towards the broken door.


"TALK LATER , WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE NOW!" He yelled.


We started running. I could hear the sound of dragging from behind , Dave was chasingÂ  us even though its legs were cut off. I took a glance at it and it was leaving a trail of blood, both from its tears and cut off legs.


We were suddenly met with armed men pointing their guns at us.


"STAY CLOSE" said Tracey.


The armed men started shooting at us , But Tracey used his arm to make a shield blocking all the bullets. We ran past them.


"Dave will be busy with them now , We can make our escape!" I happily said to him.


We both took a glance back and saw something horrifying, Dave jumped over them and was still chasing us.


"Seems like it's still mad at you for killing its egg" said Tracey worriedly.


Now we had both the armed men and Dave chasing after us. We kept running and then there was a Y-intersection where the hallway got divided into two separate ones.


"You go right , I go left. I'll track your location through the phone" Tracey said as he tossed the phone to me that I had given him to hold onto.


I went right and he went left. Seems like I drew the short end of the stick because Dave was after me.


"WHY DON'T YOU GO AFTER THE OTHER GUY WHO ACTUALLY HAS SUPERPOWER" I yelled at it.


It roared back at me , I guess reasoning with it was not the best idea.


It was faster than me even with its legs cut off , It almost caught me but I took a sharp right turn and it crashed into the wall.


"Can't change directions well huh" I said to myself.


Then I took another sharp left turn which caused it to crash again.


"Keep crashing loser" I mocked it.


It got even more furious and started dashing using the force of its arms instead of dragging , Why do I always have to make stuff harder for me?


I kept running and realised there were no more turns but just a dead end with an air vent too high for me to get into it , Dave was right behind me.


I charged towards the dead-end and put my foot on the wall , Dave jumped towards my direction. I then did a back-flip over Dave and It crashed into the wall. I used its back as a step to climb into the air vent. 


I started crawling in while it tried putting its arm inside , Which was unable to reach me.


After going through the vent system , I finally reached outside the building. I finally thought I was safe , But no. Tracey grabbed me while protecting us from bullets. 


"You managed to lose Dave?" Tracey asked me.


"y-yeah" I replied.


"JUMP IN" a voice said from inside a car that pulled up in front of us.


We got in the car without hesitation. Then the car started moving towards the exit while the men were still shooting at us.


"Daniela Sanchez......DS?" Tracey asked.


"Yes , I'm the one who sent you that message" said the woman in the Driver's seat.


I looked back and realised we were still not safe , Dave was at the top of the UDA building looking at [us.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnnaturalUniverse/s/MZZsHWg1Ch)
