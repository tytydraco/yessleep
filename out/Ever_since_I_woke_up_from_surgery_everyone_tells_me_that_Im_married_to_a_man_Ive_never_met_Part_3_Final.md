[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12vadf7/ever_since_i_woke_up_from_surgery_everyone_tells/)

The ring of the doorbell set off a flurry of butterflies in my stomach. *This is it*, I thought, as I got up to greet my friends. *Whoever is trying to save me will make their attempt tonight.*

I reminded myself that I’d done my part. It hadn’t been easy, but I’d managed to follow the instructions left for me. I’d taken the requested pictures of Brandon’s book, and, judging by the camera’s absence from the bush I’d dropped it onto, someone had retrieved it. Importantly, I’d completed the most challenging task of all: I’d stayed alive.

To do so, I’d made a promise to Brandon that he regularly reminded me of, a promise that I had no intention of ever fulfilling. If, at the end of the night, I remained Brandon’s captive, I’d finally try to fight him. I’d lose, but I’d at least go down swinging.

I opened the door to find Mae and Casey, both nicely-dressed, the former holding a rectangular box under her arm. I welcomed them inside and turned towards our remaining guests.

My jaw dropped as Olivia introduced me to her fiancée. I instantly recognized her round face and curls of blonde hair.

*“Emma*,” I blurted out impulsively.

She held out her hand. “And you must be April.” As she thanked me for hosting the dinner, I stood dumbfounded, unsure of what to do or how to respond.

Had my dreams of Emma arriving as my savior come true? Was she just *pretending* to be Olivia’s fiancée, and really here to engineer…*something* that would set me free?

Or had Brandon already outplayed me? This could be his own sick way of taunting me – of showing me that not only was Emma out of my reach, but also forcing me to witness the painful spectacle of her coerced into romance with one of my close friends.

“Something wrong?” asked Brandon, noticing my perplexed reaction to Emma.

I snapped out of my daze and shook her hand. “No, no, it’s nice to meet you, Emma. Please, come in.”

\~

“Well, Olivia, are you going to tell them the story about how you two met?” asked Mae as Brandon poured wine for everyone at the table except Martin.

“Oh, it’s embarrassing,” giggled Olivia, her face growing a little pink. “Do I have to?”

“It is *your* engagement dinner,” said Mae. “The least you can do is share with our generous hosts how-”

“It’s alright,” interrupted Emma, putting her arm around Olivia. “I’ve got this, if that’s alright with you.”

“Sure,” said a relieved Olivia.

Emma took a deep breath. “So, it was after the snowstorm last winter. As you may remember, there was ice *everywhere*. All over the roads and sidewalks. I was taking my dog Tessa on a morning walk, and here comes this young woman, clearly underdressed for the weather and in last night’s outfit, speed walking towards a thick patch of black ice.”

“Be sure to bring up where she was returning *from*,” teased Mae.

“Oh,” whined Olivia, her hand covering much of her face. “You don’t need to-”

“Olivia had just had just spent what I’m sure was a *very*, ahem,” she glanced at Martin before continuing, “let’s say *exciting* night with a true gentleman of a boyfriend who let her walk home alone in apocalyptic weather.” 

“Ray was never my boyfriend,” whined Olivia. “It was nothing serious, and he had to get from the hotel to the airport early, and he offered-”

“You had your chance to present this story yourself!” snorted Mae as she swallowed a gulp of the wine. “Let Emma tell it.”

Emma resumed her narration. “Anyway, I’m watching her approach, and I could sense exactly what was about to happen. But before I could say anything, Olivia – as she’d tell me her name was – lets out a shriek as she goes sliding across the sidewalk. I ran to catch up with her, and tried to grab her as she tumbled backward towards me. She ended up falling on me, and we landed in the snow together.”

“How romantic,” commented Brandon. I shuddered as a tipsy Mae made a pun about them ‘falling’ for each other.

“Did it hurt when you fell down?” squeaked Martin from his booster seat.

“Don’t worry little guy, I was fine,” reassured Emma. “But Olivia told me her ankle was in pain, so I insisted she come inside with me and Tessa so that I could take a look at it. We chatted a bit, and I eventually convinced her to call an Uber to take her the remaining few blocks to her and Mae’s place. I looked her up on social media afterwards, we made plans to meet up, and yadda yadda yadda, now we’re here, celebrating our engagement.” Emma gripped her embarrassed partner’s hand as she finished the story.

I had no idea how to process all of this. I’d spent months convincing myself that Emma loved *me*. Now, she and Olivia seemed so happy together, so sincere in their affection. If it was an act on their part, it was a convincing one.

Anxieties I’d fought hard to repress began to resurface. I had no memories of Emma and I being together, after all. Just a picture, Jean’s words, and some scribblings in Brandon’s book. Even if she *was* here to help me, who’s to say that she still loved me, or, if I made it out of this mess, that I’d still feel anything for her?

As Brandon served dessert, other concerns began to bother me. None of our guests had shown any sign of having a plan to fight Brandon or rescue me from him. What if I’d been wrong about this whole thing, or if Brandon – or Martin, for that matter – had left the note as part of some twisted prank at my expense?

\~

When I wished Martin goodnight, I played it cool despite knowing that it was the last time either of us would have to act our way through that particular ritual. “Sleep tight, and don’t let the bedbugs bite,” I told him, trying to sound as loving as I could, before Brandon took him upstairs. I wondered about the winged demon inside of him. Did it enjoy playing a giggly child?

Upon Brandon’s return, Mae placed the box she’d carried inside on the dining room table. “There’s one more thing we need to do tonight.”

“I didn’t know you were serious about it!” exclaimed Olivia.

“Oh, she is,” chuckled Casey. “She’s been telling me about this for weeks.”

“You *promised*, Olivia, remember?” said Mae. “One more time before you move out? Plus, when else are all of us going to be together like this?”

“One more time of *what*?” asked Emma.

“You’ll see,” replied Mae with a sly smile. She looked at me. “Y’all have a fireplace downstairs, right?”

\~

At Mae’s request, we turned off the lamps and ceiling lights. Instead, only the flames from the fireplace and the half-dozen candles that lined the perimeter of the circular table illuminated the detailed design of the Oujia board Mae placed on it.

Surrounding the usual features of an alphabet, a series of numbers, “yes,” “no,” and “goodbye,” were finely-drawn images of the sun, a crescent moon, a pentagram, and an owl wedged between two human skulls.

*So, what was the plan here, exactly?* I thought. *And who’s in on it? Mae? Mae and Casey? Emma? No one?*

“What do you think about this?” I whispered to Brandon as we took our seats, genuinely curious about his reaction.

He shrugged. “I don’t think it’s real, if that’s what you’re saying. Just a harmless game. If it bothers you, I can ask everyone to leave.”

“Oh, it doesn’t,” I blurted out, perhaps a bit too quickly. The last thing I wanted was to be left alone with Brandon, tonight of all nights.

“Last chance, Olivia,” said Mae. “I know I kind of pressured you. Are you sure-”

“Oh, it’s fine,” Olivia responded. “You were right. It’s been too long since we did something like this.” I noticed that she was tightly gripping Emma’s hand.

Casey offered to retrieve an unopened bottle of wine he’d brought from the kitchen. “Sounds good to me,” said Mae, giving him a quick kiss on the cheek. “Please get started and don’t wait for me,” he said before heading upstairs.

“Well, let’s begin then.” Mae looked over Olivia, Emma, Brandon, and me. “Everyone, close your eyes. Soak in the ambience. Remember, we’re here only to *observe* any spirits who answer us.”

After several moments, Mae began quietly chanting. “*Reveles vosmet inquieti spiritus*. Restless spirits, reveal yourselves. *Reveles vosmet, ultrices spiritus*. Vengeful spirits, reveal yourselves.”

“Any reason you're calling *these* spirits, in particular?” asked Emma, jokingly.

Mae sighed. “We don’t want some lame-ass ghost to show up and give boring answers about being content in the afterlife. You’re about to get married. It’s a big moment in your life. Before that, I want to give both of you an opportunity for closure with anyone you never had the chance to wrap things up with. *Especially* if they have some reason to be angry with you.”

At Mae’s direction, Olivia and Emma joined her in placing their index and middle fingers on the planchette.

After a few moments, Olivia noted that nothing was happening. “Nothing’s going to happen,” complained Emma. “This is silly.”

Mae instructed them to give it some time. “Just relax, and don’t resist if you make contact with a spirit. Let it move through you to communicate with us.” 

Olivia piped up after several minutes of silence. “Am I the only one who feels that?”

“Feels what?” I asked.

Olivia described sensing a cold, dark presence. Emma insisted it was just Olivia’s imagination, but then the planchette started drifting around the board in a slow, circular motion. 

“One of you is moving it!” accused Emma, but Mae and Olivia both denied it.

Mae shushed them and cleared her throat. “Is there a spirit here with us now?”

The planchette shifted past both “yes” and “no" before settling, puzzlingly, on “4.”

“I told you this was nonsense,” said Emma.

Mae maintained that it had to mean something.

“I sense…” murmured Olivia. “I sense more than one presence.”

“What are you saying?” I asked.

“I think there are *four* spirits here.”

“Are there four spirits here, communicating with us now?” asked Mae.

The planchette moved to “yes.”

“Okay, have your fun,” said Emma, releasing her grip. “I don’t like this.”

Mae continued, ignoring her. “Do you have unfinished business of some kind with Olivia?”

The answer was “no.” Mae repeated the question regarding Emma, and got the same response. “Is there someone here you have a connection with?”

The planchette shifted to the alphabet. I read out the letters on which it landed: B-R-A-N-D-O-N.

Brandon chuckled. “Alright, I’ll play along. Spooky ghosts, what do you want with me?”

The planchette darted, swiftly, through four letters: K-I-L-L.

Brandon complained that the joke wasn’t funny, and Emma requested that they stop the séance.

“Even if we stopped,” explained Mae, “we’ve already summoned these spirits. We may as well get more information.”

Brandon sighed. “Fine, but I want to wrap this up soon. Vengeful spirits who want to kill me, what are your names?” 

Their response prompted a shift in his perspective. As the letters spelled out B-E-A-T-R-I-C-E, G-A-R-R-E-T, E-R-I-K-A, and finally K-A-T-H-L-E-E-N, he grew visibly uncomfortable. “What the fuck?” he muttered.

I remembered those names. They were Brandon’s most recent victims before me. Were their spirits here now? Or was this some kind of elaborate trick?

The planchette, still handled by Mae and Olivia, began to move unprompted. “U-P-S-T-A-I-R-S,” I read out, unsure what to make of it.

“Where’s Casey?” asked Emma.

“Oh shit.” Mae jumped out of her chair and ran up the steps, calling her boyfriend’s name as she went.

“This is over,” said Brandon, pushing Olivia’s hand off the planchette and returning the board to the box Mae had brought it in. “I think it’s time for you all to leave-”

Mae’s high-pitched scream rang from upstairs. Olivia called out, asking if she was alright, but no response came.

“I’ll check on her,” said Brandon, getting up from his seat.

“No, no, you stay here with April,” said Emma. “I’ll go.”

Brandon, Olivia and I waited at the foot of the stairs as Emma ascended. “Oh God,” she called down. “There’s blood *everywhere*\-“

“Watch out!” Olivia hollered, but it was too late. A shadowy figure from above grabbed Emma around the neck and dragged her out of sight. The door slammed shut.

Olivia and Brandon hurried up to it, trying to wedge it open. “It’s like there’s a piece of furniture blocking us,” said Brandon. He glanced down at his feet, noticing a puddle of red liquid leaking from under the door frame onto the top steps. “What is this? What’s happening?”

I’d never before seen Brandon like this: frightened and confused. Not that I was in better shape.

“Oh God,” said Olivia, noticing the blood. “I have to get to Emma. Is there any other way up there?”

“You-you’d have to go around back,” I stammered. I tried to tell her to flee and get help rather than back inside. I didn’t want her to get hurt, too. But, in my panic, the remainder of my words came out as a useless jumble. 

Olivia sprinted downstairs, opened the door to the backyard, and burst outside. The door slammed shut behind her.

I was still in no physical shape to be traversing the staircase or the hilly landscape, so I waited where I was.

My mind struggled to process the events I had witnessed. Had we really summoned the spirits of Brandon’s latest victims? If that was the plan, who was in on it, and had it gotten out of hand? Were Casey, Mae, Olivia, and Emma injured, or worse?

Brandon, meanwhile, appeared to be having a meltdown. He was pacing in a loop, talking to himself as he did so. “How could they…how could she…he can’t…she can’t…this can’t happen…”

A thud at the glass window to the backyard got our attention. Through the darkness, I saw a circular object rolling away into the grass.

One after another, three more round objects hit the glass. I screamed when I realized what they were: the *detached heads* of each of our houseguests. “Oh fuck,” gasped Brandon.

At this point, any real parent would try whatever they could to get upstairs and check in on their son. But neither of us were real parents, and neither of us had Martin on our mind. Instead, fear and confusion immobilized us both.

I stumbled into a corner, crouched into a ball, and covered my face with my hands. This was far, far too much for me to take in.

What was happening? Were my friends *dead*? The horrific sight of the decapitated heads of Mae, Casey, Olivia, and my supposed savior Emma sent me into a guilt-ridden stupor. Had they, like Jean, died because of me?

“*This can’t be happening*,” I heard Brandon repeat to himself.

The sound of a door creaking open prompted me to look up at two figures entering from outside. One waited behind while the other approached Brandon.

She was pale and appeared emaciated, with a strikingly gaunt face. “You thought you were rid of me, didn’t you?”

Brandon responded in a meek, tepid voice. “I don’t know you. What the fuck do you want from me?”

“I look just as I did when you left me. Sucked of life. Withered, scrawny. A mere shadow of my former self. Look at what you did to me.”

Brandon again denied knowing her.

“I know that you’re a liar. You tricked my friends, my family, my doctors, and my own fucking therapist. You told me that you were my boyfriend. But, now, I know the truth. I see through your lies. You’re nobody.” *This was Beatrice*, I realized, recalling the description from Brandon’s book.

The figure I inferred to be Erika stepped forward, positioning herself next to Beatrice. She had a similarly shrunken, weak appearance. Her clothes were tattered, and she appeared half-decayed, with several holes in her skin exposing rotted flesh underneath.

She spoke in a rough, gravely voice. “I spent my whole life coming to terms with my identity. No matter how many people told me I needed someone else, that I had to be attracted to *somebody*, I stayed true to myself. Until you came along. Suddenly, the whole world was telling me that you were my loving husband. The whole world convinced me of a lie. I held out for *so* long – for *years* – until I couldn’t take it anymore. I finally accepted you, and look at what you did to me in return. You left me dead, an unwholesome meal for the worms.”

“I…I…don’t know what you’re-”

“Hush,” snapped Erika. “Your pathetic lies don’t fool me any longer. I see the truth. You’re a weak, inept coward. You’re not my husband. I don’t love you.”

Sweat had soaked through Brandon’s clothes. His shaking body backed up against the wall and collapsed.

The door upstairs swung open, revealing Garret and Kathleen. Their feeble forms stumbled down the stairs until they stood next to Beatrice and Erika in a semi-circle around Brandon.

“I had everything planned out,” said Garret. “It was going to be a happy retirement. When you appeared, claiming to be my son and heir, I denied it, only for the doctors to say that *I* was the problem, that my memory had deteriorated. You took everything from me. Not just my estate, but also the golden years of my life. I want you to know that I reject you for the scum you are. You don’t fool me, and you are not my son.”

Kathleen went next. “I hate you for what you did to me. I was *so* young and inexperienced when you entered my life. I ate up your lies. I went along with what everyone told me about you. But all I see when I look at you now is an ugly, pitiful creature. You’re not my fiancé. I don’t love you and I don’t believe you. Nobody does.”

Tears streamed down Brandon’s eyes. “April…help me," he blabbered.

Beatrice, Erika, Garret, and Kathleen turned towards me. After what they’d done to my friends, I felt more terrified of them than I did of Brandon.

“Brandon’s asking for your help,” said Beatrice. “Well? Are you going to help your husband?” 

I froze. I had no idea what to do. I could try to run. Maybe these spirits wouldn’t follow me. Their enmity was towards Brandon, not me, after all. But that hadn’t stopped them from fucking *slaughtering* my friends. But what other option did I even have?

“April Lin: do you have anything to share?” asked Beatrice. “Any truth you wish to tell?”

That’s when it hit me. I still couldn’t make sense of the situation, but I knew, in that moment, that, somehow, they were the ones who’d left the note for me. *They* were the ones with a plan to defeat Brandon.

I *hated* them for what they’d just done to my friends. Yes, they were victims of an incredible crime, one I’d experienced the misery of firsthand, and they’d been turned into monsters by it. But I couldn’t find any sympathy for them, not after what I’d seen them do.

But, I recognized that they were giving me an opportunity to deal a finishing blow to Brandon - a chance to stop him from killing me, and from destroying the lives of every victim he would seek out next. I had to take it.

I stood up and stepped forward, joining the circle they had formed around Brandon. “April, dear,” sobbed Brandon. “Please, please…I love you…”

Mustering my last bit of willpower, I managed to speak in a firm, commanding voice. “Jean told me everything.”

“No, no, he didn’t…”

“I’ve known ever since the accident that you’re not a human. You’re a cambion. A trickster. I’ve been pretending to love you for months. I hate your guts. I was never going to sleep with you. You disgust me. You are not my husband. You never were. And Martin is not my son.” I spat on him.

Brandon’s face started to shift in form, the skin of his cheeks and forehead sinking downwards towards his chin. “I…I love you, April…” were his last words as his face plopped off, hitting the floor as a plain, wooden mask.

His skin loosened and fell into a pile. The scaly, winged form that remained looked meager and delicate compared to what Martin had transformed into at the hospital.

Beatrice gripped Brandon by the neck and lifted his limp form against the wall. She reached her free hand back towards Kathleen. “The athame,” she commanded.

Kathleen complied, placing the jeweled black handle of a sharp dagger in Beatrice’s hand.

Beatrice stared straight into Brandon’s eyes. “This is for what you did to April.” With two rapid motions, she sliced the blade across Brandon’s throat and then dug it deeply into his heart. Brandon’s lifeless body fell against the floor in a growing pool of his own blood.

His demise brought me little catharsis. I’d survived Brandon, but at such great cost to others, and I was still in danger. What the hell would happen now?

Beatrice, Erika, Garret, and Kathleen faced me once again. Were they going to kill me too? Or return to where they came from and leave me with the murderous demon child upstairs?

“What is *wrong* with you?” I bawled. “You didn’t have to kill my friends to get your revenge. They never did anything to hurt you. You’re monsters, all of you.” 

Beatrice raised the knife. But, instead of using it against me, she jabbed it into her own cheek. I watched, shocked, as she twisted it around her head, sending a thick stream of blood running down her dress.

That’s when I realized what she was doing. Her face snapped off as a plain wooden mask. The woman before me changed shape. Her straight, grayed brown hair curled into a striking blond. My heart fluttered as I recognized the figure underneath the layer of blood and bits of loose flesh that steadily fell off of her real skin.

She placed her hand gently on my shoulder. “It’s me, April. Your wife.”

\~

I would learn later just how busy Mae, Casey, Olivia, and Emma had been over the last month. Jean had left Emma with plenty of resources – books on dark magic, objects charmed to resist Grousel’s influence, and a blade that could penetrate the skin of a cambion in its true form.

Emma first connected with Mae, whose name Jean had left as someone able to provide assistance if anything happened to him, and Mae quickly looped in Casey and Olivia. They each donned, and never removed, one of the charmed objects – a bracelet for Casey, matching rings for Emma and Olivia, and a necklace for Mae.

After days of studying Jean’s material, Mae finally developed a plan. “It’s a long shot,” she explained. “It’ll be dangerous, and it could very well fail. But if we do *everything* right, it really might work.”

Emma responded without hesitation. “Whatever it takes, I’ll do it.  I’m not leaving April with that monster.”

Mae listed the materials they would need for the base: two liters of salt water and two pints of blood – one of the “untouched,” one of the “sinful” – mixed with python scales, root of hemlock, garlic, and a pinch of burnt *sel gris*.

They were able to gather the ingredients with varying degrees of effort. I know that Emma provided the former blood contribution, citing a technicality in the antiquated definition likely on the minds of the dark magic practitioners who developed the spell; I never pressed as to who gave the latter.

The more formidable task was constructing the masks. As an initial matter, they needed me to gather information. I’d found Brandon’s book once, after all, so surely I could locate it again.

They knew that, after Jean’s stunt, Brandon would be on the alert for any attempt to communicate with me. The costumed entertainer had been Casey’s idea, though Mae had been the one to don the cat suit at the party. They kept the content of the note as vague as they could, such that Brandon wouldn’t trace it back to them if he discovered it.

The most challenging part came after Emma retrieved the camera. In the weeks that followed, they set about identifying the full names and, then, the burial sites of each one of Brandon’s last four victims. At night, they snuck in, shovels in hand, and dug. These excursions required careful planning – after all, the last thing any of them wanted were criminal charges for graverobbing.

At the six-foot mark, Casey would chisel away at the coffin that encased those Grousel had drained of life. They weren’t after the bodies – just stretches of their wooden encasings, which Casey and Emma then spent days carefully crafting into crude, unadorned masks.

The final step came the night before the party, when Mae carefully lowered all four masks into the liquid base, leaving them to soak overnight.

When they pulled up to my townhouse, Mae’s car was filled with the items their plan required: the masks, prop heads, fake blood, the athame, and the Ouija board and planchette. Casey was prepared to step away at the start of the séance to gather everything they needed from the car. Olivia and Emma had carefully rehearsed their loving couple routine, something they’d designed to justify both Emma’s presence and the dinner party itself, and Olivia and Mae knew just where and when to direct the planchette.

“We can do this,” Mae had said. “We *can*, really. Grousel has been destroying the lives of people just like us for *centuries*. Let’s go kill him.”

\~

Of course, I wouldn’t understand any of this until later. Instead, I stood dumbfounded, my jaw fully-dropped, as what I’d believed to be four vengeful spirits reverted into my blood-covered friends.

“We’re okay, April,” said Mae as she shed the remains of Kathleen’s body. “Though I do appreciate how upset you were about our deaths.”

“It’s over now,” said Emma. “You’re safe.”

I shook my head. “What about Martin?”

“From what I read,” Mae replied, “Since he’s just an illusion, he should just disappear now that Brandon’s-”

“Martin’s *not* an illusion,” I spluttered. “He’s a *copy* of Brandon. I saw him transform into the same type of fucked up creature.”

All eyes turned to Mae. “Oh…*fuck*. That might be a problem.”

The door upstairs slowly opened. We watched as a small child – one I *finally* could stop pretending to love – stepped forward and examined the gruesome scene below.

I thought about making up a story – that daddy had been hurt in an accident, or that we were all doing some elaborate roleplaying game – but it would be of no use, and I’d grown sick of lying.

“We just murdered your dad, you wretched little bitch,” I sneered. “I never really believed you were my son, and we're going to kill you, too.”

\~

It’s possible that I could have said something more constructive. But I can’t say I regret anything, even when accounting for the chaos that subsequently unfolded.

Martin’s mask fell quickly. It made sense to me – there was no one left to fool.

I only remember what followed in a blur. Martin pounced, charging towards us at a rapid speed. He knocked into Mae, who hit her head hard against the table as she fell.

The next thing I knew, me, Emma, and a furious Casey were holding Martin down while Olivia ran for the dagger still embedded in Brandon’s body. I remember Martin’s claws slashing into Casey’s chest, Martin’s flailing legs kicking and destabilizing the tall bookcase next to me, and a brief glimpse of a vase sliding off of a top shelf before everything went to black.

\~

I found myself back where I’d started so many months ago. I awoke alone in the upstairs bedroom of my townhouse. I felt groggy, and my head ached.

The door opened. Emma entered with a tray of food. She smiled at me when she saw that I was awake. “I know you have a lot of questions. But first, how is your head?”

“It’s fine, please just tell me exactly what happened after…after…”

“You got knocked out cold? Okay.” Emma recounted how she and Casey had managed to restrain Martin just long enough for Olivia to run the blade through him. “Martin’s dead,” she told me. “You really are safe now. It’s all over.”

I asked about the others. According to Emma, Olivia had taken Mae and Casey to the hospital. “Mae got a concussion. And Casey’s got cuts all over him. Not too bad, though. They’ll both be okay.” 

“The blade…can I see it?” Emma asked me why. “Just bring it, please, and the book where Brandon documented his spells. It’s in the attic, in the bottom of the box by the stairs.”

Emma did as I asked, returning a few minutes later. “Jean’s the real hero behind all of this,” she said as she passed me the knife. “Left us with everything we needed to finally-”

She froze, stunned, as I hopped to my feet and held the blade up to her throat. “April, what are you doing?”

\~

It wasn’t easy going down two flights of stairs while holding a knife against Emma’s throat. One misstep, and I could have slit it by accident. But I held it there anyway like my life depended on it.

Emma tried reasoning with me, listing all the reasons why I didn’t need to worry about her.

“Look, if you really are Emma, I’ll apologize to you later. But I’m too fucking tired of being lied to, of being told that I’m ‘safe’ when I’m not.”

“April, *please*, don’t do this-”

“Did it never occur to you how it might look, with you here by my side and everyone else conveniently absent?”

Emma thought about this for a moment. “Okay. I understand. For all you know, I could be Martin, in a new mask, trying to fool you again.”

“I don’t know what to think. I don’t even *know* you. Just do what I say, *please*.”

“Okay,” said Emma. “Okay, I get it. I’ll do what you say. We’ll get through this.”

I hated how I couldn’t tell whether Emma’s words reflected honest devotion to me, or just another diabolical ruse. After all, that’s just what Brandon would have told me.

At my direction, she reignited the remaining wood in the fireplace and tossed the book onto the flames. As its pages slowly turned to ash, I continued to hold the blade against her skin. She stared at me, her eyes warm and longing, and I stared back. 

I prayed what Jean told me would once again be correct – that burning the book would undo the remainder of Brandon’s spells. I prayed that I take back the life that was stolen from me.

My prayers came true. The blade fell to the floor as memories rushed through me.

I recalled meeting Emma at the book fair; the long conversations in coffee shops; the nights she convinced me to go out with her friends; the way we slowly separated from them on the dancefloor. I remembered counting down the hours until I’d see her again; confessing to her that the only thing I’d ever done before was exchange an awkward kiss with the boy my mother pressured me into taking to prom; the slow progression between Emma and me of holding to kissing to touching to sex – *so much* earth-shattering, mind-blowing sex.

I remembered the way she held me and let me cry onto her shoulder the night after I introduced her to my parents. The trip we took abroad; the day we adopted Tessa; the signatures we placed on our marriage certificate. As my love for her coursed through my veins, it felt like it was always a part of me and had never left. It surged like a river, and it grew in strength with each passing moment.

I knew, right then, that there was nothing more true, more real than what I felt for the woman sitting next to me. I wanted to fall asleep holding onto her and to wake up with her still there beside me.

I’d get my wish. Many hours later, Mae, Casey, and Olivia would return to our home, with a few bandages from the hospital and Tessa from daycare. They’d find me sleeping on the sofa with my arms wrapped around my wife, and I’d awaken to loving kisses from a dog reunited with its long-absent owner.

But in that moment, sitting there by the fireplace, all I could do was cry. I buried my face in Emma’s chest as my tears soaked through her shirt.

“What is it April? What’s wrong?” she asked.

“Nothing,” I croaked. “Nothing. They’re [tears of joy](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeaceSim/).”
