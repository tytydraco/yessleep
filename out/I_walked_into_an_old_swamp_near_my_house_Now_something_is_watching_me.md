It was a cold evening in late February, one of those Brabant nights where the fields stretched dark and endless, only broken by distant farmhouses and the occasional stand of trees. Fog clung low to the ditches, and the air smelled of damp earth and the last breath of winter.

 

I live in the Brabantian countryside, in the south of the Netherlands. Nothing but small woods, open fields, and farms. But this land wasn’t always like this. Just two centuries ago, it was heathland and swampy wetlands - a place where people didn’t settle unless they had to.

Even now, a tiny triangular piece of swamp remains, nestled between the fields like a forgotten remnant of the past. I’ve always loved going there with my dog, just to imagine what my ancestors must have seen when they first moved here.

 

My parents were out of town for a few days, so I was home alone. After school, I crashed on the couch and dozed off. When I woke up, the sky outside was already darkening.

 

"Shit, I have to walk the dog!"

 

I grabbed the leash and sprinted for the door. It was later than I usually walked her, but I didn’t think much of it. The swamp wasn’t far, just a few minutes away.

As I neared the entrance, I heard the heavy clomp of hooves.

To my right, in the fading light, stood a massive black horse.

It was taller than any horse I’d ever seen, its body impossibly dark, like it absorbed the light around it. Het Spookpaard, I thought. The ghost horse of Brabantian folklore, said to appear before disaster strikes.

 

A superstitious shiver ran down my spine, but I shook it off. Just a story, right?

Well, my dog didn’t think so. She barked, her tail low, her body stiff. But the horse didn’t move. It just stood there, watching.

A deep, unnatural dread settled in my stomach, but I forced myself to keep walking.

 

The dog didn’t want to go in.

I had to drag her into the swamp. The moment we crossed the threshold, the air changed. It was too still. Too silent. My dog’s ears flattened, and she whimpered, growling at something I couldn’t see.

 

Then, the fog rolled in.

It was instantaneous, like someone had poured milk into the air. One second, I could see the fields in front of me. The next, they were gone.

I turned back. The way out was nothing but an endless wall of white.

That’s when I heard it.

 

A voice.

 

A woman’s voice, calling my name.

It was soft, distant, yet impossibly close.

A chill crawled down my spine. I knew I shouldn’t go toward it. But my feet moved anyway.

I walked forward, my breath quickening. My dog growled, tugging at the leash, desperate to leave.

 

Then… silence.

The voice was gone.

The fog shifted.

 

And she was there.

A woman, standing just a few meters ahead.

She was pale, too pale… Her skin almost blue in the cold light. Her long, tangled hair clung to her face, and she wore a tattered white gown, stained with dirt and something darker.

Her eyes were… they were just wrong.

 

My dog went wild, barking, snarling.

 

Then she smiled.

 

And laughed.

 

It wasn’t a human sound.

It was a jagged, broken noise, like something trying to mimic laughter and failing.

I ran.

 

I don’t remember deciding to run - I just did. The ground was slick with mud, my breath sharp in my chest. My dog barked wildly as I scooped her up and sprinted toward the edge of the swamp.

But the swamp didn’t end.

 

I ran for minutes. I should have been back in the fields by now, but the fog stretched forever.

The laughter followed.

 

 

Closer, too close…

 

The moment I saw the open fields, I leaped over the ditch without looking back. I ran all the way home, the whispers clinging to my skin.

 

Only when I slammed the gate shut did the sound stop.

 

I locked every door, every window. My dog refused to leave my side, her body trembling. I curled up on the couch, heart hammering in my chest.

 

I don’t remember falling asleep, but at some point I must have dozed off

 

When I woke up, it was morning. The sun was shining. Birds were chirping.

I was covered in sweat, like I just woke up from a fever dream.

 

I must have just come home from school, passed out on the couch and slept through the entire night. It was unlike me, but I had been feeling a bit ill, so it wasn’t impossible. Besides, it was by far the most reasonable explanation.

 

On my way to school, I passed an old farmer.

 

I had never seen him before. That was strange—this was a small township. I thought I knew everyone.

 

He waved me down.

“You’re lucky to be alive, son.”

His voice was deep, rough. His piercing blue eyes locked onto mine.

“What do you mean?” I asked, my stomach twisting.

He smiled, too wide, inhumanly wide…

 

“There’s a reason that swamp was never cut down,” he said. “Those creatures you saw… they used to roam all these lands. But now? They’ve been driven back, forced into the last scraps of what once was.”

 

I swallowed hard.

 

“You’re safe for now,” the man continued. “But it’s got your scent now. It knows who you are.”

I felt sick.

 

“If you ever hear whispers at night… don’t look outside. Never.”

 

I opened my mouth, but before I could speak, he let out a low, guttural chuckle.

And it was the same laugh I’d heard in the swamp….
