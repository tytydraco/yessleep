Like me, if you were born during the 2000’s, you probably grew up watching Cartoon Network, and if you watched Cartoon Network as a kid then you most definitely watched “The Amazing World of Gumball”. This story is about what me and my best friend saw when we went to visit Elmore. If you google “gumball house irl” you can actually find the address to the real life house. In fact, every building in Elmore is real. Gumball’s house, the mall and the school, It’s all there. But in the pictures, everything is abandoned and looks straight out of an apocalypse movie. At the time, me and my best friend, who we’ll call Torsson, were really into urban exploration. We liked the thrill of exploring places we weren’t supposed to be, all while being in constant fear of either getting chased by zombies or accidentally walking in on a bunch of hobos having an orgy. Anyways, we saved up money and booked plane tickets from Sweden to California.

When we arrived, we took a taxi down to the address, tipped the driver (apparently you have to tip everyone here) and started exploring. Of course we started with Gumball’s house. The house surprisingly enough only had one story, and the inside was way smaller than what we expected and looked nothing like in the show. The inside was in the same condition as the outside. For being an abandoned building, the floor was really dirty. Do all American homes have carpeted floors? apart from some disarranged furniture and the broken glass on the floor from the window we broke in order to get in, the house was basically completely empty. We also went to the green house and the school. Same thing there, empty, dark and creepy. The school was actually in really good condition, which made it even more creepy. Thankfully we didn’t need to break anything to get in.

After hours and hours of exploring our favorite childhood cartoon, we decided to go to Mr. Robinson's house. In every picture you find online, all the front doors are closed and presumably locked. But for whatever reason, Mr. Robinson’s front door was slightly open. Now this should’ve been an immediate red flag because it was closed when we first arrived. But of course, why would 2 idiot 17 year olds think anything of it? We stepped inside and took in the smell of…well, an old abandoned house. The first room we went to is what i think is the living room, and holy fuck, when we entered that room we were greeted with the most awful stench you could possibly imagine. The smell was so bad I don't even know how to describe it. Imagine switching out every hygiene product with a decomposed animal. That’s what it smelled like. The closer we got to the couch, the stronger the smell became and after vomiting a couple of times, instead of leaving like we should've, we decided to move the couch. And when we did, we found a latch in the floor. I wish we never opened the latch to the basement.

I was the first to stick my head down the hole. What I saw was so disturbing it still haunts me 2 years later. The floor and walls were covered in feces, newspapers covered the floor and on top of those newspapers was a cage. And in that cage was a person. A naked and extremely skinny person. No, skinny isn’t the right word. They were practically a skeleton with skin on. What made it even worse was the video camera in front of the cage. Me and Torsson quickly ran out of the house and called the cops, who arrived shortly along with an ambulance. The man was named Kee Yamamoto, and had been missing for 7 months. And even though there was a camera, nobody was convicted or arrested. I don’t know if the man is still alive, but I assume he’s dead. There’s only one thing I know for certain. Me and Torsson will never forget what we saw that day, nor will we ever be able to watch The Amazing World of Gumball the same way ever again.
