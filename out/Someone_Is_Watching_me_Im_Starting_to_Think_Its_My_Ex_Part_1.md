I don’t even know how to explain what’s been happening. It started out so small, little things I could brush off—until I couldn’t. And now I feel like I’m being watched everywhere I go.

I think someone’s stalking me.

At first, I thought I was imagining it. I’d notice things that felt… off. A follower request from an account I didn’t recognize. A text message that didn’t make sense. I brushed it off because, honestly, what else was I supposed to do? But now it’s clear: whoever this is, they’ve been planning this for a long time.

The first real sign was a text I got while I was out with friends.

Last weekend, we went to this bar downtown, just me and my two closest friends, Sarah and Jess. It was packed, so loud you could barely hear yourself think. Which was kind of the point—I wanted to get out of my head for a while.

Sarah, of course, was on one of her true crime kicks, teasing me about Ryan, my boyfriend.

“Okay, but seriously,” she said, swirling her cocktail. “What’s the deal with Ryan? Too-good-to-be-true vibes. I’m calling it now: serial killer.”

I laughed. “He’s not a serial killer.”

She grinned. “Says every girl in a Netflix doc before she ends up in a ditch.”

“God, Sarah,” Jess groaned, rolling her eyes. “Not everything’s a crime show.”

“I’m just saying, if he’s that perfect, something’s gotta give.”

I rolled my eyes and tried to laugh it off, but when I said, “There’s no catch. He’s just… nice. After Ethan, I needed nice,” the mood at the table shifted.

Even now, I wish I hadn’t said his name.

Ethan is my ex. We broke up six months ago, and it was bad—like, restraining order bad. He was controlling, obsessive, and toward the end, I started to think he might snap. I blocked him on everything, changed my number, even moved apartments. As far as I knew, he was gone.

Until the text.

Ryan texted me around nine, saying he was on his way to meet us. A minute later, I got another notification. It wasn’t from Ryan.

Unknown Number: “That dress looks nice on you tonight.”

I froze. My stomach flipped as I stared at the message. I tried to tell myself it was a coincidence, some kind of prank. But the way my chest tightened told me I didn’t believe that.

“What’s wrong?” Sarah asked.

“Nothing,” I lied, locking my phone and sliding it into my bag. “Just a spam text.”

I forced a smile, tried to laugh at their jokes, but I couldn’t shake the feeling. It followed me all night—the sense of being watched.

Ryan showed up a little while later. He kissed my cheek and slipped his arm around me like he always does, steady and reassuring. For a second, I let myself relax.

But then my phone buzzed again.

I didn’t check it this time. I couldn’t. Not in front of him.

The rest of the night passed in a blur. We stayed out late, drinking and laughing, but my mind was somewhere else.

When we walked back to my car, the streets were empty. Too empty. Ryan offered to drive me home, and I handed him the keys without thinking.

As I opened the passenger door, I froze.

There was a folded piece of paper sitting on the seat.

My heart was pounding as I reached for it, my hands trembling. I unfolded it slowly, and my stomach dropped. The handwriting was neat, deliberate, and unmistakably personal.

“You’re better than this. I’ll prove it.”

I spun around, scanning the street. There was no one.

“Everything okay?” Ryan asked from the driver’s seat.

I shoved the note into my bag and forced a smile. “Yeah. Fine. Let’s just go.”

But it wasn’t fine.

When I got home, I stayed up half the night staring at that note. I told myself it was a prank, some random creep. But the handwriting—it was his. I know it was.

And then my phone buzzed again.

Unknown Number: “Sweet dreams, Mia.”

I didn’t sleep that night. I kept hearing noises, footsteps outside my window. I told myself I was imagining it, but deep down, I knew.

He’s watching me.
