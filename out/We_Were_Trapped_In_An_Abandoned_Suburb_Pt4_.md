*Their reflections had no eyes.*

Just empty, black sockets. It wasn't a split second frame either, every moment where the camera catches their reflections, they appeared to have no eyes. 

The reality began to set in.

I had been suspicious, but I hadn't known it was truly that bad. If anything, I thought the real Bryce and Zack were somewhere hurt, and these were just copies. The truth was, they were eyeless wraiths, just like the four victims of the Eye Ripper, their spirits corrupted by the evil here.

*'Soullessness hurts,’* that's what Zack had said. Zack fell victim to that boy in the basement, then Bryce fell victim to Zack when we left them alone together. They wanted to lure us outside so they could jump us and take our eyes like their eyes had been taken. It was like a zombie infection type of thing, if your eyes were ripped out in this ghastly place, you ended up a monster as well. Forced to haunt a limbo, looking for something you may never find, driven to mutilating living people despite it not doing anything but spreading the torment like a virus. 

I was determined not to end up like that. 

I wondered if, if any of us had looked at the mirror at any point, would we have seen the lack of eyes in the reflection or was it only visible on camera? We were so distracted, of course we didn't look at the vanity. I shuddered as I imagined what it would have felt like to discover such a horrifying thing with Zack and Bryce still in the room with us. 

But… where were their bodies? If Zack was truly dead, why hadn't we found his corpse in the basement? Same with Bryce, why hadn't we found his corpse in that room? 

Whatever the case, after seeing this, I wasn't willing to waste another moment sulking or grieving. I was going to gather everyone and look for more eyes. I had a feeling I knew how, too. 

I stood up from the corner with the intention of rousing Vanessa to ask her questions about the Eye Ripper case, when something caught my eye. 

The window. 

The curtains that covered it had a small sliver of space open between them, where I saw a pale nose almost flush against the glass pane. 

Fear struck me like a lightning bolt and I yanked one side of the curtain open to reveal a different ghost boy. The one in the basement had black hair, this one had brown hair and a little blood smudged under his nose. His head immediately shifted ever so slightly so his hollow eye sockets were facing me. His little hands were pressed against the window. He looked like he was in a crouching position.

It suddenly hit me that we were on the second floor. 

“I-I’m gonna find your eyes,” I desperately tried to reason with the thing, “so please, leave me and my friends alone until then, okay?” 

The boy stared at me with an emotionless face. Then, his lower jaw unhinged, turning his mouth into an O shape, and a puff of vapor ghosted from between his white lips and fogged the glass. Slowly and mechanically, he used a finger to draw a pair of eyes in the window. They were shaped like lemons with big irises and little pupils.

I nodded eagerly, thinking I was getting somewhere with this. “Yes. Yes, your eyes. I'm gonna give them back to you.” 

Then, with his finger, he erased the details off the eyes he drew, including the irises and pupils, until it looked like two darkened ovals. Mimicking empty eye sockets. I frowned.  I knew the implication, but I wasn't sure if this was a threat aimed at me or if he was showing what had been done to him. 

I shook my head, not knowing what to say next. The boy simply crawled up and above the window, towards the roof, scaling the wall like a spider. I closed the curtains again, feeling myself tremble. That interaction didn't instill me with any hope at all. I could hear him crawling on the part of the roof above the room we were in and it freaked me out, but I tried to ignore it as I continued my course of action. 

Could they get into the house? Yazmine said locked doors don't deter ghosts, but maybe she was wrong or these were a different type of ghost. She told me about ghost categories in the past, some of them follow the rules of the physical world, like being able to be hurt with blunt force. In any case, they clearly knew where we were. 

I woke Vanessa up and said, “We need to start trying to escape, I have to ask you some questions about the four kids.” 

She rubbed her eyes and sat up, loosening her hood. “Like what?” 

“Millie's eyes were hidden in her teddy,” I began to explain as I paced the room, “so I began to wonder, are the other eyes hidden like that?” 

“I dunno.” She shrugged.

“Was her teddy noted as missing in the report?” I asked. 

“Yeah, the articles and news reports all mentioned she went missing with her stuffed bear,” Vanessa replied. 

“Did the other kids go missing with any objects?” I chewed my lip in thought. 

“Yes, actually.” Vanessa perked up. “Peter, the black haired boy in the red shirt, went missing with his school backpack. Oh, and Sarah’s little purse she got for her birthday was with her when she was kidnapped and wasn't found anywhere.” 

“What about the other kid, William?” I began to grow hopeful. 

“Ummm…lemme think.” I could see the cogs turning in Vanessa's head. “Damn, I don't think I remember William going missing with anything other than the clothes on his back.” She sighed. 

“We'll figure that out later,” I waved her worries away, “right now, we're gonna be on the lookout for that backpack and that purse. It's like you said, serial killers keep souvenirs. Those items were what the kids were last seen with, so he kept them for himself, and I guess he saw their eyes as souvenirs too, so he placed them inside those things, if my theory is right. I hope I'm right, at least.” 

“So, you think they're in the basement?” She looked nervous. 

“That should be the first place to check.” I nodded. “After all, the last time we went, we didn't know exactly what to look out for, and that basement is like the inside of a hoarder's house. Do you remember seeing anything like that down there?” She shook her head no. “What's the color of the backpack and purse?” 

Vanessa fought hard to remember. “The backpack was a dark color, something from back in the day, and I don't remember the exact color. The purse was pink, it matched her shirt, I remember that much at least.” 

“Great, we just gotta get Yaz and John and go back there, then we'll only need one more set of eyes.” I marched towards the door, Vanessa hot on my heels. First, I went to John's room, and opened the door. He was lying on his side on a twin bed, facing the wall. It looked like it had once been a little boy's room, but the boy in the old photograph on the floor wasn't any of the victims. 

Vanessa saw me looking at the picture. “The neighbors moved out not long after the murders,” she elaborated, “they were very hush hush about it and wouldn't answer any reporter's questions. I think they started to realize that this place was becoming…like it is now.” 

“John,” I called to him, walking over, “we know how to find at least four other eyes. We just need to go back to that basement. I know it's scary as all hell, but we made it out just fine last time and this is the only way to escape with our lives.” 

He didn't answer me or move a muscle and I sighed, wondering how I was gonna get him to comply. Vanessa pointed, “Shut that window! Why’s it even open?!” 

I looked over to see that, indeed, the window halfway obscured with dark blue drapes was wide open. 

“Dammit.” I went over and shut it, fairly fed up. “John, be a man and get your ass up!” 

I started to feel uneasy as he refused to move. I exchanged a nervous glance with Vanessa. His stillness was reminding me too much of the ghost children, and I could feel the air thicken with tension. What if one of those entities had entered through the window? 

I slowly crept over to his bedside, steadily reaching my hand out then… 

I yanked his arm towards me, pulling his body onto his back. 

I expected to see him emotionlessly staring at me like Zack and Bryce had, but instead I saw red rimmed eyes, a snotty nose, and cheeks glistening with tears. He wasn't a ghost, he was simply crying and ashamed. 

“Leave me alone.” He pulled away from me. 

“Don't you want to get out of here?” Vanessa asked with frustration. “Stop wallowing and get up!” I thought she was being a hypocrite, but I didn't say anything.

“Fine,” John pushed himself up and wiped his tears away, “but I’m not going back to that basement.” 

“Then where are you going?” I asked as he stood up.

“You know those other two roads?” He asked me. “The ones that don't lead back to town. I'm gonna try one of them. Even if they don't go back home, maybe they go somewhere far from here.” 

I groaned. “You can't be serious. You think only that one road was affected by the curse here? You'll just end up right back here!” 
 
“You two can go hunting for rotten eyes as much as you want!” He snapped. “But I can't stay here! I can't, man!” He rushed past us. 

“Wait!” I called after him. “Zack and Bryce, remember?!” 

“I'll go through the back door!” He called back. 

“Whatever,” my face felt hot from anger, “let's go get Yaz. She won't abandon us.” 

Vanessa and I went to the room where Yaz had run to. She was standing at the window, peeking out through a crack in the blinds at the front yard and street outside. The moonlight made her brown eyes sparkle along with her tears, and she seemed both pissed and depressed as she scanned the area for any signs of those wraiths. She didn't look up when we gently opened the door. 

“Yaz,” I said softly so as not to startle her, creeping forward, “we gotta go, I have a plan.” 

“I saw an adult.” Yazmine replied emotionlessly, and I could hear her swallow from across the room, as if she was forcing bile back down her throat.

“What?” Vanessa and I said at the same time and looked at each other. She was back to holding the camera and recording, but her eyes were looking over the screen and at my best friend with hope glimmering in them. 

“An adult,” Yazmine repeated, her gaze not leaving the window, “it was a woman, and she was standing beside that house over there.” She pointed. “Just by the woods, so still I almost didn't notice her.” 

“So someone else is trapped here?” I tried to wrap my mind around this, stuck between thinking it was unfortunate for another person to be stuck in this dreadful place but also being happy that we weren't alone. Truth be told, I was exhausted at playing the role of leader, and wanted nothing more than a grown up to make all the hard decisions for me. 

“Yeah, you can say that.” She still didn't look at us. “But she's not alive, like us. She had no eyes.”  

My heart plummeted to the bottom of my stomach, and the look on Vanessa's face told me hers did the same. 

“So…” Vanessa began. “The kids aren't the only ghosts here…” 

“No.” Yazmine shook her head, sounding numb. 

I thought of something, and patted my pockets. I pulled out the phone I had found earlier, which was now fully charged from my power bank, and turned it on. I was met with the faces of two smiling women as the homescreen. The most recently opened app at the bottom was the camera. I clicked on it and found a video, the date being a year ago. I heard Vanessa approaching my side to see what I was doing as I played the video. Frantic breaths and whimpering sobs immediately blasted from the speakers. 

*“If anyone sees this,”* one of the women from the homescreen had her sweaty, terrified face extremely close to the camera, *“tell my mom that I love her. Tell my fiance that I'm so, so sorry that I couldn't come back to him. My name is Lisa Waller and I'm a journalist, I heard rumors about this place and-”* The distant sound of a twig snapping made the woman's head snap away from the camera. We could see that she was in the woods, somewhere around this terrible street. The camera shook as she stood up and started running. 

*“They won't let me leave!”* She desperately screamed as she ran for her life.  *“If you're here and you're listening to this, you need to find what's left of him here! That boy, Will, he was the last and he got free! He ran into the trees but the killer caught him! His parents are part of the occult, he started this, I just know he did! Please, I don't want to be like them!”* 

“Jesus,” I whispered, Vanessa in silent shock as she looked over my shoulder. Yazmine still hadn't moved from her spot but she stared at us, unnerved. 

*“It's her, it's Rachel,”* the woman cried, *“she doesn't have any fucking eyes and she's been chasing me for hours!”* There was another minute of panting and thundering footsteps before: ***“Nooo! Stop! Rache-!”***  

Suddenly, the camera was now focused on the ground as the woman dropped her phone and screamed gutturally, followed by a wet squelching sound and a resounding thud that shook the camera a bit. She was silent. Then feet walked into the frame, wearing sandals. The phone was picked back up, and we gasped as the camera focused on the eyeless corpse of Lisa Waller, sprawled over the forest floor. 

*“Your sacrifice won't be forgotten.”* A woman's voice hollowly said from behind the camera. I screamed as the camera flipped to the face of the other woman from the home screen picture, deathly pale with two gaping voids instead of eyes. She raised two bloodied, torn out blue eyes to the camera. *“Please come here,”* she pleaded to us in a quiet voice almost as if she could see us, *“if the body rejects the soul, we have to hunt again. We need you. Don't be afraid.”*  

We watched in horror as the specter brought the camera into the basement of the Eye Ripper house, her breath and sound of her footsteps eerily absent from the video as she traveled quicker than what appeared normal .The closer she got to the basement, the more the video glitched out, freezing and cutting forward by a few seconds. We could barely tell what was happening, it was dark and clearly the file was corrupted. 

Then finally, her grotesque face again, barely visible in the darkness. *“Why didn't it work?”* She asked so quietly we almost couldn't hear her. *“I can feel myself becoming nothing. What am I?”* 

Then it ended. 

With jittery fingers, I dropped the phone, feeling as if it was still connected to that horrifying spirit and wanting to be rid of it entirely. It wouldn't help us anyway, there was of course no way of contacting the outside world, and I wasn't concerned about evidence at the moment. 

“That phone, and the pack of half smoked cigarettes,” I swallowed, “everyone who's come here ended up like this. That's why those were there, they're things left behind by people who died here. Who knows how many things in that basement weren't even there before it became abandoned. How much of that actually belonged there??” I just couldn't seem to process it. It all felt like a bad dream. 

“I knew it was weird,” Vanessa started as she licked her lips, “that some people who've been going missing the last few years were heard talking about visiting this place.” 

“How is that possible?” I hounded her without meaning to, my stare intense. “Didn't that raise any red flags with anyone?!” 

“It did, but whenever people came investigating, there was no sign of them being here. None at all.” Vanessa's eyes glazed over as she spoke the horrible truth. “I’ve read all about it. The police always ended up saying it was more plausible they went missing on the way here because they never found any evidence the missing people even made it here! It's almost like this place just…erases all of it! *Hides* it.” 

I turned to Yazmine. “We know how to stop this, we just need to find an old school backpack and a pink purse, it should have two of the kids’ eyes in it. It's - it's like a curse. I-If we get rid of it at the root, the victims of the Eye Ripper, I'm sure it'll set off a chain reaction and then everyone will be free! Dead or alive!” 

“This isn't a fucking movie, Grace.” I was shocked by Yazmine's hardened tone and the way she stared at me. “What you're doing is called *wishful thinking.”* 

“What?!” I looked at her like she was out of her mind. “Stop it, you saw how we survived the Jenkins girl. She took her eyes back and left and we haven't seen her since. She's gone from here, she's been appeased. And, listen, there's something I need to tell you both…” 

They looked at me curiously. I took a deep breath and broke the bad news about what I had seen on the camera. They didn't believe me until I instructed Vanessa to rewind to that part of the footage and they saw it for themselves. 

*“Oh my God.”* Yazmine choked out, clamping her hands over her mouth and closing her eyes as more tears squeezed from them. 

“We were talking to them. We were talking to them and the entire time they were dead.” Vanessa ran her quivering fingers through her hair. 

“So they're just walking corpses?!” Yazmine bawled. “Zombies or something?! What the fuck is this place?!” 

She looked like she wanted to have a breakdown, both of them did, but I knew I couldn't afford to let them do that if I wanted to go through with my plan. We couldn't afford to waste anymore time grieving.

“Listen,” I said, shaking Yazmine's shoulders gently to snap her out of it, “we can't stay here and cry, we have to-”

“Those two women fucking died here, didn't they?” Yazmine was suddenly invading my bubble, almost nose to nose with me with an angry glare. “What if you're wrong and we have to 'appease' them too? What if there's a lot more than just them? How many people do you think tried to tour the house where one of the worst murder cases of the state happened over the last *several years?!”*

“Yaz, this isn't you.” I shook my head. “You're optimistic, you're strong, you were the one who suggested finding their eyes in the first place.” 

“I'm also the one who brought you all here to begin with!” Her voice cracked and the furious expression on her face melted into one of deep sorrow. “The idiot that got Zack and Bryce, John's friend and my *boyfriend,* killed.” She turned away, refusing to let us see her wipe away her tears. 

“Don't sell yourself short, Yazzy,” Vanessa smiled and stepped forward, putting a hand on my friend's shoulder. “You didn't know…” 

In an unexpected turn of events, Yazmine spun around and planted a hard smack on Vanessa's cheek, stunning her. “You two timing bitch, you think that means anything coming from you?!” Her hoarse voice shrilled.

“Keep it down!” I shushed her, putting myself between the two. 

Yazmine shoved me out the way, cornering Vanessa. “I know you've been messing around with my boyfriend behind my back! Everyone said you were the easiest girl in school, a real skank, but I didn't listen and I got tired of seeing your pitiful ass being left out all the time so I made you my friend!” 

Vanessa started crying. Afraid of being the object of Yazmine's wrath, I cowered away and meekly said, “Look, this isn't the best time to do this…Let's get out of here and then you can tear her a new one.” 

“The last thing he ever did to me was turn his face away when I tried to kiss him!” Yazmine grabbed Vanessa's throat and pushed her against the wall, her fingers didn't tighten to strangle her but rather they simply pinned her in place. “All night, you two were acting like *you* were the ones dating! He's *dead* and I can't even remember him as a loyal boyfriend!” 

Watching this unfold, and seeing Vanessa pathetically weep without even struggling, a fire started to burn in me. I always let Yazmine get her way, and let her drag me into things, and I was sick of being submissive. I wasn't going to stand there and let her devolve everything into chaos after I worked to keep us all in this together. Our lives were in danger, people were dead, and we didn't need this petty highschool drama. 

“Get your hands off her, Yaz!” I shouted as I pried my friend's fingers from my rival’s throat. Yazmine looked at me, shocked.  “There's no time for this…” I added in a quieter voice. “Things are trying to kill us and this is what you're worried about? Look, I'm sorry to say it, but I had already told you I thought Bryce wasn't good for you. I mean, I don't want to speak ill of the dead, but it needed to be said. And Vanessa has always been a jerk so I don't know why you ever expected anything from her.” 

Vanessa rubbed her arm up and down awkwardly, clearly disliking my insult but not having the guts to protest about it. 

“You're better than this,” I pushed Yazmine's dark hair out her face, “and I'm sure if Bryce were here, he'd tell you he was sorry, however genuine it may be,” I rolled my eyes, “and after this is over you can dump Vanessa as a friend and never have to speak to her again. But until then, you have to keep it together so we can get the hell out of here.” 

Yazmine didn't break my stare for a few moments. Finally, she sighed and murmured, “Okay. So what are we doing?” 

“Going back to that basement and finding a pink purse and a backpack that may have belonged to Sarah and Peter,” I replied, relieved she was behaving herself , “they likely have their eyes in them. It's worth a shot.” 

“Fine, then let's do it, let's do it and get out of here,” she walked out the room and suddenly turned to Vannessa to jab a finger at her face, “and after this, you're back to being a loser slut.” Vanessa didn't answer, but by the look on her face she seemed hurt, despite her own betrayal. 

As we went down the hall, I explained John's absence to Yazmine, who seemed exasperated that he had truly left on his own on a futile suicide mission, and then we gathered our courage to leave that house which had seemed like a safe haven. We went downstairs, our steps quiet, and towards the utility room where the back door lay. A white solid door and a screen door behind it, in the right hand corner of a small rectangular area where a washing machine, dryer, and pantry was located. 

I was in the lead, and I silently opened the first door. The window of the screen door revealed the overgrown backyard, drenched in darkness and just barely lit with moonlight from a full moon. At this time, you should've been able to hear the nightly cacophony of nocturnal insects, maybe even seen fireflies, but there was no sign of life whatsoever. It felt like someone had hit the mute button of the remote on the world same as you would to a movie. I hated it more than anything, as it made it feel all the more lonely. 

The girls right behind me, I tried to open the screen door as quietly as possible, but since it was aged, rusted, and weathered it would not yield without sound. The hinges squeaked, the door's groan increasing in pitch and volume as I eased it outward. We all cringed visibly, with Vanessa being at the back and looking over her shoulder, and Yazmine and I peeking around the backyard which hadn't been tended to in quite some time. 

There was no one, dead or otherwise. We stepped onto the cement doorstep one by one, and then our feet tread long and dead grass which should've been teeming with bugs but wasn't. We crept to the edge of the left side of the house, where several feet of wide open space lay between us and the Eye Ripper house’s back door. We would be vulnerable, shadowed by the treetops but still highlighted by moonlight and uncovered by any building. Anything could spot us, and we had to work our nerves up before we could even think about making a run for it. I peeked around the corner of the wall to be sure the street, or at least how much I could see of it, was empty. 

What came next happened so fast it makes my head spin just thinking about it in the present. 

First, a scream rang out from Vanessa and Yazmine and I followed her terrified gaze over to the treeline at the edge of the backyard. I noticed the pink shirt and long blonde hair right off the bat. Sarah Miller's ghoulish face was soaked in shadow as it stared lifelessly at us. She was so still she may as well have been a doll, made to stand upright between two trees. 

My mind shifting to autopilot as the scared animal inside me yearned to get as far as possible, I turned to run, only to be face to face with the visage of the eyeless brunette boy, William. I felt his fingers dig into my eyes and I blindly shoved him away with a shout of pain and ran. I was heading for the Eye Ripper house and I could hear Vanessa and Yazmine screaming as they  followed me. The back door was getting tantalizingly closer.

Then, it opened, and Zack walked out. The illusion was broken, and it was very clear to us that he was missing his eyes as well. What he was doing in the house, I had no idea, but as soon as he saw us his face balled up and he burst into tears while charging at us. The tears were made of blood, and his mouth stiffly moved with his whimpers as his sockets narrowed from being pushed down by his furrowed eyebrows. 

“The car!” Yazmine screamed, grabbing my hand and dragging me towards the street. 

*“Grace!”* Zack called, his voice on the verge of breaking with emotion but not quite there yet. I couldn't take my eyes off him as he flailed his arms outwardly while running to catch up with us. *“I got away!”* His voice heightened in pitch with a sense of deranged euphoria and he smiled. *“Thank Christ I got away! I did! I got away, Grace, I did!”* 

We were almost to the car when Vanessa shrieked as she got yanked backwards by Bryce, who wrapped his arms around her neck and face with his fingers wriggling for her eyes like worms. She closed her eyes and tried to force his hands off her, crying out in terror. Yazmine pushed me towards the car and launched herself at him, wrestling him off of Vanessa and tackling him to the ground. I hurriedly climbed into the driver's side of John's car as a crying Vanessa scrambled backwards on the asphalt watching my friend fight the ghost.

Seeing her in this state, I got out of the car and grabbed her under her arms, pulling her into the driver's side seat. “Come on, Vanessa, hurry!” I screeched, white hot panic flashing through me at the sight of all the wraiths we'd encountered heading right for us. Zack was running clumsily like a madman, Sarah was gliding forward an inch off the ground, and William was crawling and scrabbling along the pavement like an oversized spider. 

Once Vanessa was in the seat she closed the door and I was about to get in myself, but I turned to see Yaz still struggling with Bryce. He stuck a finger and thumb into her right socket, trying to pluck her eye out, and the still night air was filled with cries of pain. Quickly, I yanked Bryce off of her by his  hair and shoved my fingers into his eye sockets, hoping to stun him. It felt freezing cold inside and wet, but when I took my fingers out, they weren't wet at all.

*“Don't leave us.”* Bryce begged, his voice flowing out his gaping mouth without his lips moving. He slowly stood up. *“We need you.”*

Just as the others descended upon us, I helped Yazmine to her feet and we scrambled into the car, shutting and locking the doors behind us. We were now trapped, with eyeless wraiths surrounding us, including our former friends. They put their hands against the windows and pressed their faces into the glass, making sure we felt their hollow stares piercing deep into our beings. 

Then, after a short while, Sarah was beside my window, covering her face with her hands again but facing me as if she was ready to play a game of peek a boo with a baby. William decided to crawl up the hood of the vehicle and onto the roof, his face frozen in an expression that reminded me of the Ghostface mask. He simply crawled around up there without end. Then, Peter, as if he'd been told fresh eyes were for sale by the others, was standing a few feet away from the car and simply watching intently. Bryce and Zack paced in slow circles around us, meandering with emotionless expressions. 

We all refused to look at them, instead choosing to either look down at our laps or at each other. Vanessa let the camera go limp in her hands as she buried her face in her lap, giving up on recording for the time being. Yazmine pulled her hood to her sweat jacket over her head and covered her eyes with her hair. I looked up at the ceiling of the car, thinking over my life choices which led me here.  

“We have to escape.” Yazmine suddenly said after a while, turning to look at me in the back seat. 

“How?” I asked without looking at her, annoyed at her just saying the obvious. 

“I'm also open to suggestions,” Vanessa said as she watched William crawl from the roof down the hood for the hundredth time. 

“I'm gonna lead them away.” Yazmine replied, making us both gawk at her like she was crazy. She noticed our look and sighed. “I've thought about it long and hard, and I'm gonna make a run for it. I'm gonna run around one of these roads and  keep all of them distracted long enough for you two to find what you're looking for.” 

“That's insane.” Vanessa said. 

“I want to see if I can find John out there anyways.” Yazmine replied. “I don't wanna leave without him and he's the muscle of the group.”  

“You think you can really outrun all of them?” I asked incredulously. 

“I run track, Grace,” she smiled weakly at me, “even in death those lame-os can't beat me, and if I run out of breath, I'll hide. Or maybe I might even make it out somehow and I can get help. Either way, I'm doing this. I got us into this mess, so I'm gonna take one for the team. Don't try to stop me, okay?” 

My eyes started to water and I sniffed. “You don't fucking die on us, okay?” I sternly snapped at her. “We'll do this and you're gonna escape with us, alright?!” 

“Alright.” Yazmine leaned over to hug me tightly. Her embrace felt warm and comforting, as it always had. 

“I'm sorry about Bryce, Yazmine.” Vanessa said, refusing to make eye contact, and it was clear she wasn't just talking about his loss.  

“Yeah.” Yazmine nodded, then faced forward and took several deep breaths. She waited for Bryce to pass by her door and before Zack could make it around, she slammed open the door and ran out. Vanessa quickly shut it behind her.  

All the entities stopped their creepy activities and watched her for a moment, then immediately gave chase in their respective ways. Vanessa and I held our breaths as we watched Yazmine lead them down the street, past the abandoned houses and into the crossroads. She continued straight on, knowing it would only bring her back. 

“Let's go!” I climbed out the car with Vanessa and we ran into the Eye Ripper house through the front door. There seemed to be no wraiths in sight...

...Not right at that moment, at least.
