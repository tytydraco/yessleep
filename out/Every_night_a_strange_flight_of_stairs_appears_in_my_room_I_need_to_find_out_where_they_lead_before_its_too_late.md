It all started just after I moved back to my old house. I had been going through a messy divorce, and unfortunately, the whole painful process had forced me to go back to the only other home I knew and the only other place I could afford.

I moved back into my parents' old house, though they no longer lived there. The place had been rented out since they had moved away. Ultimately, they did not have the heart to sell it. I suppose it had worked out. Since I was being forced to come home, they were able to set me up there with almost no rent and a general agreement to look after the old place.

Though I was grateful for a chance to start over, the move back heralded the strange events that followed and were the catalyst of why I am stuck where I am now.

It was the first evening back in the house after nearly ten years. I had wished my parents were there, but I contented myself just exploring and reminiscing as I wandered the halls and brought the few possessions I still owned inside.

It was surreal being back, especially living there all by myself now.

I finally managed to get all my boxes inside, and I let out an exhausted sigh and closed the front door. I was tired from moving and knew I had an early morning with a longer commute to work the next day. I decided to turn in early and went to my old room, which I had put all my bedding in. It was smaller than my parents' room, but the familiarity compelled me to stay in there for the night, even if I might end up moving to a larger room later.

I threw myself on the small mattress that I had brought and was fast asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.

I had a few dreams of my childhood in the short time I slept. But my brief rest was not meant to last. In a few short hours, sometime just after dark, I woke up. At least I think I woke up; the entire experience left a heavy fog in my mind, one that still felt very much like a dream.

The sensation was strong enough to compel me to get up. I decided I would get a glass of water and try and go back to sleep. When I stood up, I saw that the door to the bedroom was ajar. I thought I had closed it, but I figured I must have forgotten.

I walked up to the door and threw it open. I was stunned by what I saw.

The hallway was gone; in its place was a spiral staircase. I rubbed my eyes to make sure I was seeing what I was seeing. This had to be a lucid dream, but it all felt too real. The stairs I was looking at were heavy stone, not unlike the tower of a castle or cathedral.

There was a drowning echo ringing out in the cavernous stairwell that unsettled me. I leaned in to get a better look around, and I felt the rush of air flowing through it like a tunnel.

The stairs were a spiral that went both up and down, even though I was already on the top floor of the house. I had no cause to question dream logic, so I decided to enter the stairwell and go down. I thought maybe I would still find a kitchen in my sleep and be able to get a drink before going back to bed.

I stepped onto the stairs, and my feet were chilled by the cold surface of the stone steps. They felt real, and I hesitated for a moment. I began walking downstairs, slowly at first. The spiraling stairs gave me a sense of vertigo, despite not being too steep. I brushed it off and continued.

Moving on for a few minutes, the scenery had not changed. The stairs spiraled ever downward, but there was no door, no exit, just more steps. I had been walking for so long that I knew I would have passed the first floor minutes ago.

My descent slowed, and I realized I was getting nowhere, at least I did not think I was. I decided to turn around and go back to my room. Maybe once I got there, I would wake up from this bizarre dream.

I turned around and started back up the stairs. When I looked up, I saw the spiraling steps looming down at me like a skyscraper. I could not even perceive the top. I kept walking for a similar stretch of time to my original descent. I started to grow concerned when I passed several levels with no door or aperture to exit. I knew I should have passed the door I had entered by that point.

I started to move faster, my feet thrumming dully off the stone steps as I raced up and up. I started feeling the walls for hidden handles or levers. I needed something, anything, to get out of this stairwell, which began to feel more claustrophobic by the moment.

After running up the stairs for what felt like ages, I felt exhausted. My heart was hammering in my chest, but I saw something that finally gave me pause.

It looked like writing on the wall. It was the faint outline of what may have been chalk. I stepped closer and squinted in the gloom to see the writing on the surface of the wall.

It read,

“If you see this, turn around! Grabbers are ahead. One step forward, two steps back, the grabbers will get you if they attack. I will help you if you help me, so up then down, down and away you'll be.

Stay safe - Sherie”

I was confused by the message. Who was Sherrie? And what was a Grabber? I considered the odd writing and was about to blow it off when I heard something. There was a soft dragging sound, echoing down from the stairs above.

I paused to listen and heard a pronounced shuffling noise, followed by the movement of some lumbering form upstairs. As I stood there, listening in rising tension, I also smelled a fetid odor and felt a chill current of air billowing down the narrow stairwell.

I suddenly felt very vulnerable, and the disturbing dragging sound from upstairs grew louder and more insistent. I decided I needed to get away from that sound and whatever was making it as fast as possible. I turned back and started rushing down the stairs again.

In my haste, I nearly slipped, and when I caught myself on the wall, the sound of my palm slapping against the cold stone echoed all around and above me as well.

Suddenly, there was a feral cry from above me, and the slow dragging sound gave way to loud, ringing footsteps sprinting along the stairs. I started to panic and kept running down the stairs. The sound behind me grew louder and louder. I could not seem to gain any ground on whoever, or whatever was making that sound. Whatever its nature, it moved with terrifying speed, and I did not think I could outrun it.

Then I began to hear the low rumbling tone of labored breathing echoing down the stairwell.

I had to get out of there; whatever was chasing me was gaining fast and would catch me at the rate I was going. I was considering something as I fled. I thought of the strange writing and realized I might have one chance to try something. The writing had mentioned steps up and down.

I turned back toward the encroaching sound above me, and against my better judgment, I took a step up the stairs. Then, without turning around, I walked backwards, down two steps. I heard an odd shifting sound, and as if acting on some unknown instinct, I reached my hand to the right without looking and grasped a door handle.

I barely had a moment to register my success when I heard the thunderous sound of rampaging footsteps bearing down on me. I took one glimpse into the shadows above me and saw the outlines of large figures rushing down towards me. I snapped out of my terrified daze and threw the door open and fell through, kicking the door closed as I dropped.

I landed back in my room and painfully sat up, huffing and puffing. I had no idea what the hell happened, but I was grateful to be back in my room.

I walked over to my nightstand and grabbed my phone. I saw it was two in the morning and I turned on the flashlight. I inched closer to the door and listened carefully. I did not hear anything. No ominous clamor or the thundering pursuit of hidden hunters, just silence.

I tried to quell the paranoid feeling in my mind as I nervously grasped the handle and slowly opened the door. I peeked through the narrow opening I had left and saw the hall of my house. No stairwell, no stone steps, no shrouded figures, just the hall.

I let out the breath I had been holding onto and relaxed. I decided against going downstairs for water; I did not want to see any more stairs just then.

Instead, I resolved to just go back to bed. I had no idea what I had taken that day that would give me such vivid and unsettling dreams. If I knew, I would try and avoid it in the future.

I shambled back to sleep and saw something odd. It was near where I had unceremoniously thrown my mattress earlier that day. There were marking on the wall just faded enough that I had not noticed them earlier. I looked closer and saw another message drawn in chalk.

I was starting to get concerned. I knew I was awake, but this looked like the message I had seen on those impossible stairs.

It read,

“If you are seeing this, I couldn't find my way back. I rented the place for a while, but I found the steps. I need to see where they lead. I don’t know if this is a dream or reality, but in case it’s real and I don’t come back, send help. - Sherrie”

It was the same person who signed the message on the stairs. Same name, same chalk. How had they left a note in my room and in my house? They said they had stayed here and gotten lost on the stairs. 

With dawning horror, I considered the implications of the writing and how it was there in my room while I was awake. I began to realize that everything I had experienced that night was real. The endless stairs, the shadow figures stalking the spiraling steps. As well as someone named Sherrie, trapped in that labyrinthian staircase with whatever those Grabber things were. 

I had no idea what to do next, but I knew I had to do something. I had taken my first step into a madness inducing spiral and wherever it led, or who it led to, would have to wait for another night.
