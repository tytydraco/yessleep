Hey, everyone. Thanks for sticking around this long. Honestly, I thought I would disappear before I could write the second part of my story, so being able to write a third feels surreal. I’ve never been more grateful to be stuck in a barn. Writing is still a lot of work **(Dennis’ Note: Try adding my priceless commentary)**. But the last week has been so confusing that I wanted to get my thoughts down. I hope you’ll be able to make more sense of it than I could.

I had gotten back to Dennis’ house well after midnight after being shoved from Alex’s body, so once I’d explained what happened he put Gabbie’s phone on the charger and went to bed. The phone turned on with a blinding flash a few minutes later, but the old ghost hunter was already snoring. The lock screen appeared, and while I didn’t know the password, I decided to hazard a few guesses. Unfortunately my fingers couldn’t generate enough heat to press the buttons, so I left Dennis to sleep and decided to check on my experiment. 

After I posted the first part of my story, I started working on a way to fight fire with fire. Dennis had used nothing but weeds and managed to concoct a way to prevent ghosts from touching his equipment. I wanted to do the same. I’d tried using clover, oak bark, and rose petals so far, but none of them had done anything perceptible. I had been hopeful when I'd spotted a few sprigs of dill among the tangle of plants in Dennis’ overgrown garden, and decided to mix it with violets in this latest attempt. The resulting mixture looked unimpressive at best. I looked skeptically over at one of Dennis’ experiments: a line of old soda bottles that hummed in the presence of paranormal energy. I had rinsed off the gel easily with water, but the effects still lingered. I kept my hand at the shortest distance possible and sprinkled some of the crushed up mixture onto the bottles, hoping the growing noise wouldn’t wake Dennis.

But moments later, the humming stopped. 

I pumped my fist in the air, accidentally knocking over one of the bottles and sending it crashing to the floor. I considered sprinkling the mixture on everything in the basement, but stopped myself. I wanted to keep this advantage secret from Dennis for now. I attempted to hide the pieces as best as I could, then went back upstairs. When I did, however, I heard Dennis already talking on the phone.

“I’m on my way, ma’am, don’t you worry.”

I decided to keep quiet until I had distanced myself from the basement door. “Where are you going?”

“Sun Valley Farms,” Dennis grunted. “The owner’s wife told me they were under attack from monsters and need help. Would’ve called it hog-shit not a week ago, but we know better now.”

I frowned. “No way in hell you’re going. I’m invisible. It would be safer if I went alone. I don’t trust those farmers.” Dennis paused, his expression uncharacteristically concerned.

 “You sure you can go back there alone?”

I wasn’t sure. It was still hard to think about what had happened to my friends and I a few months ago, let alone the bile that rose to my throat when I considered that I had lingered in my friend’s rotting corpse for days. But even though I was scared of the monsters prowling the farm, I wasn’t going to let Dennis be sacrificed there too. “It makes the most sense, old man. You know it does.”

Dennis scratched his head, his finger tracing over age spots showing between thinning hair. He glanced regretfully out the window where a badly painted over cop car sat in the driveway, as if he had been looking forward to getting back in on the action. Then his fingers began to shake, and he sighed.“Fine. But if you are keeping out of sight, leave that yahoo friend of yours out of it.” I agreed, not wanting to risk Travis’ safety again anyway, and departed alone shortly afterwards. 

The path to Sun Valley Farms felt oddly familiar now that I had done it multiple times. As I reached the property line I took a deep breath and scanned the landscape. The corn, still unharvested, had started to wilt in the recent morning frosts, but there was no sign of hellhounds or zombies. I decided to search the northern edge of the farm first and save the farmhouse for last, since I would have the highest chance of being discovered inside. As I quickly pushed through the areas Travis and I had searched previously, my attention grew so focused on the land ahead that I didn’t notice the stillness that hung in the air. Silence had accompanied me so much since I’d become a ghost that I’d grown accustomed to it. As I drifted haphazardly out of the corn, I froze with shock as I realized why I hadn’t been noticed.

All of the corpses were forming a barrier outside the front door of the farmhouse. 

My heart caught in my throat so quickly that I didn’t scream, although the heaving gasps that followed as I attempted to calm down were just as loud **(Dennis Note: You still couldn’t be heard, nitwit)**. The corpses remained focused on the house even as I trampled through crisp, dying grass and shriveled leaves less than three feet behind them, their bodies rigid as if rigor mortis had finally set in. Bewildered, I kept my distance as I skirted the farmhouse and began searching the northern edge of the field. 

This part of the field was the easiest  to traverse; most of it had been cut before my class had ever come here, making it easier to see things on the ground. However, most of the students had run in the opposite direction, so I didn’t anticipate finding anymore of their corpses. That made me feel less on edge, though I found myself wishing I could find something else that would help remind me of my friends. As I surveyed the ground hopefully, a bright splotch of neon yellow caught my attention. Thinking it was just another piece of trash, I passed over it in search of more interesting clues. However, a sense of recognition nagged at my brain until I was coerced into checking it out. 

The scrap that had caught my attention turned out to be one of many. More than a dozen scraps of grubby yellow fabric were scattered on the ground, some of them pressed into tire tracks, others caught on the sharp edges of cornstalks. I picked up the most in-tact piece and realized why I recognized it. 

I had the exact same shirt.

In bold cursive writing, I could make out the word *Romeo*. The gaudy color couldn’t be mistaken for anything other than the shirt my school had given out to the members of last year’s play. I frowned, wondering how the shirt could have recently been shredded by a harvester. I pressed the piece of fabric into my pocket, deciding to put it out of my mind for the time being, then continued the search. Not far from the sun colored confetti I noticed a weathered wooden door on the ground just outside the field. My first thought was that it was an outhouse, but if it was, I didn't understand why they’d built it underground. Getting closer, I realized there was a soft yellow light glowing in between the rotting planks. Curious, I slipped inside.

I found myself in a room the size of a horse stall. The floor and walls were dirt, and a flimsy ladder on whisker-thin strings trailed back up to the door, with the bottom planks roughly stacked together into a pile. The only other adornment in the room was an ornate wooden table that stretched from one edge of the space to the other perfectly. 

 Lying on top was a body so decayed it was unrecognizable, its blood staining the wood beneath.

My heartbeat quickened and I frantically tried to go back the way I had come. I bolted towards the back door of the farmhouse and pushed inside, glad there weren’t any zombies guarding this door. Inside the kitchen was huge, the unwelcoming cleanliness offset by soft, reassuring yellow light bulbs. A thin, red-headed woman was finishing washing some dishes in the sink, and once she was done I followed her to the front door, where a kid about my age stood in a slouched but determined position, peeking out a small glass window at each passing car. In his hand gleamed a long, sharp-looking kitchen knife. 

“Is he here yet?” The woman asked.

The boy shook his head. “Do you think he ain’t coming?”

“Of course he’s coming.” The woman scolded. “These retired police types can’t resist putting their noses in everyone else’s business.” I laughed despite myself, grateful I was invisible. **(Dennis’ Note: Now I see why you felt the need to include this dull conversation)**.

“Maybe he could help us instead, Ma,” the boy replied cautiously.

“I already told you no once, Jacob.” She jerked a strictly pointed finger outside at the corpses. “The only way we get what we want is if we use him.”

My fear froze into understanding. Clearly I was right about them lying to Dennis. I also felt confident that these two had sacrificed a real person in exchange for something, but somehow it had gone wrong. Now they were going to sacrifice Dennis to make it right. I scoffed. Part of me had wanted to believe the old man, that these people really did need help, but after this conversation I didn’t need to hear more. I walked out the door, leaving the two as prisoners in their own home until we  could make things right.

I considered immediately going back to tell Dennis what had happened, but remembering the results of my earlier experiment I decided to talk to Travis first. He wasn’t hard to find; between gaming and practicing guitar he hardly ever left his room when it was as cold as this. Once I arrived I was grateful to see the ghost listening device sitting on his desk. 

“Knock, knock asshole. I think I’ve found a way to beat Dennis.”

That night, everything was in place. There were a few things Travis and I needed to do once Dennis was inside his barn, but for now all we had to do was wait. I glanced at the time on Travis’ phone and exhaled eagerly, glad I couldn’t feel the cold. The ghost hunter would be getting ready to feed his cat any moment now, and would realize he wasn’t inside the house. Travis was holding the cat in question, shivering, though the old tom seemed quite content stealing his warmth. After a few more moments of waiting, silent save the raging wind, we heard Dennis’ voice.

“Wesson? Come back to the house now. It’s feeding time.” 

This got the black cat to perk up, and he began writhing against Travis’ grip. I nodded to my friend and he lightly tossed Wesson towards the first of many tuna cans. He yowled indignantly for an instant until he landed on his paws, then his nose twitched and he began feasting on the tuna, then made a quick dash towards the next can. Travis and I exchanged a triumphant look as Dennis called his cat a few more times to no avail, then shut the front door of his house. A few minutes later the door opened again, and I heard the crunching of snow as Dennis trampled towards the barn. “It’s too cold to be outside, you old flea-brain. Where are you hiding?” He tried to flip the light switch but couldn’t, and I grinned. Everything was going according to plan. 

I palmed the jar of herbs I had concocted earlier and slowly made my way towards the empty horse stall where we had placed the last tuna can. Dennis was just heading inside, murmuring comfort to his horse in the adjacent stall as it snorted and stamped its hooves anxiously. As soon as he did, his foot snapped a small trip wire, which released a net from the ceiling. The ghost hunter cursed as he stumbled forward and was pinned to the ground by the thick rope. “Where are you, kid? You have your fun?” He growled as he tried to sit up. My laughter echoed between both Dennis and Travis’ speakers as I wandered into the stall and sprinkled the mixture onto the trap. As I did so, the net became invisible and phased right through Dennis. Travis offered the surprised old man a hand to help him back on his feet, and he took it reluctantly, his jaw set against aching joints. “How on earth did you manage that?” He asked as we made our way back to the house with Wesson in tow. 

“Learned from the best,” I replied with a smirk. “I just kept throwing together whatever dirt I could find until I stumbled across something that worked.”

Dennis laughed. “Not bad, boy. I knew you would figure it out.” He glanced at Travis, who was shivering even more now that we were unprotected from the wind. “Let’s get inside. I have some stew on that you can eat.” Travis chattered a thank you and we made our way into the house. 

Dennis was more than willing to let me recount the events of the day while they ate and spare him from having to make awkward small talk. I had only told Travis about my experiments, so the information was new to him as well. He stopped me almost as soon as I started. “I can open Gabbie’s phone.”

I raised my eyebrows. “You know the password?”

“No. But remember when I dated Gabbie for like three months? She had me put my fingerprint in her phone so I could read messages if she was busy.” 

I laughed. “Wasn’t that years ago?”

“Feels like yesterday.” Travis sighed with exaggerated fondness. “The eighth grade dance. She was my first kiss.” I rolled my eyes and snorted approvingly as Dennis smacked him lightly upside the head. “Dumbass. I’ll go grab the phone. I hope it’s as useful as you think it’ll be.” Wesson trotted after the old man, enticed by the frayed strings on his pant legs.

I watched Travis scarf down another mouthful of stew, suddenly feeling overwhelmed by the emptiness and envy that filled me. “I guess this is it.” I mumbled to my friend.”I mean, I’ll stay as long as I can, but after this…” My words trailed off. I had no idea what would happen after I disappeared, but none of my guesses were pleasant.

Travis didn’t respond right away. He glanced out the window, where the hilltops were still well outlined by reflecting snow. “I won’t forget you, man. And for what it’s worth, I think you'll go someplace better.”

“You already know there’s something afterwards,” Dennis remarked as he returned. “No reason there ain’t another.” Their words eased my anxiety, and through what felt like tears, I told Travis to get on with it. 

The first thing we searched was the messages, but a quick search didn’t reveal much. Travis suggested the pictures next, and I agreed. So we looked through the most recent pictures, and found only one that was clear enough to make out any details. There was a large, looming figure with wings that must have stretched over 20 feet. Where its eyes should have been there seemed to be only fire, which illuminated long, jagged teeth.

“What the hell is that?” Travis asked in a low tone, as if not wanting to get the picture’s attention. 

“Hell is right,” I murmured, describing the altar I’d seen. “I think it’s a demon.” The wrinkles on Dennis’ face deepened as he frowned. He suddenly seemed much frailer in comparison to this nightmare. Tapping away from the image, Travis continued scrolling through the pictures until he put the phone down urgently, his eyes wide. “Chase, look at this.” At first I didn’t understand what was wrong; it was a picture of the same figure, just at a slightly different angle. 

Then I understood.

The picture was dated over a year ago.
