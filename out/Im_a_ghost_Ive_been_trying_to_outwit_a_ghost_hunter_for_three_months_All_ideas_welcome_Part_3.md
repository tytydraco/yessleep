This is Dennis. I thought I’d update y’all this time instead of the kid, seeing as he’s been incorporeal for the past couple days. It’s been nice to have some quiet. Don’t you worry none, though. I’m sure he’ll have a laugh and change everything I say as soon as he gets back **(Chase’s Note: He means I translated from redneck for him).**

Anyhow, seeing as Chase got back to my house and explained his and Travis’ story before the roosters crowed, I wasn’t able to call the farm right then. So I placed the young lady’s phone on a charger and went to bed. The next morning I’d no sooner opened my eyes than I heard Chase’s voice on the upgraded speaker, which I’d placed next to a hand carved picture frame that was face down on my nightstand.

“Wake up, old man! The phone’s been charged for like four hours.”

I cursed and frowned at the empty space to my right. Even knowing the kid was around, it was still a shock to hear a voice without seeing someone. “You need my permission all of a sudden?” I grumbled.

The speaker buzzed with static for a time. “...I can’t touch the screen. I can move the stupid thing but it needs heat to press the buttons.”

“Well let me get up first, then. I can call the farm as well once I have some coffee.”

“Let me guess, black coffee?” The kid chuckled.  
I glared at the air again. ”Boy, do I look like I drink watered down hog shit?” 

Chase’s laughter garbled the speaker, but he had smartened up enough to not reply to that. “Alright. I was thinking about getting Travis’ help with the password anyway. He dated Gabbie for a while, and I doubt she’s changed the password since then. He sleeps in even later than you, though.”

“Great, more hooligans on my property,” I grunted. Truthfully though I haven’t minded the boy’s interference. Especially not since I learned what happened to him and his classmates **(Chase’s Note: Aw, you do care.).**

Once the kid had left and I’d had some coffee, I looked up information on Sun Valley Farms. The land had been owned by a particularly well-to-do family in town since I was born, but they had recently sold it to a new couple while the business was profitable. Fortunately the number had remained the same. I called, but before I’d even said hello, a woman’s voice gasped softly on the other line. “W-who’s there?”

I cleared my throat. “Morning, ma’am. My name is Dennis Thompson. I’m a retired sheriff’s deputy for Clark county, and I’ve been trying to gather some information about the accident that occurred on your property a few months back.”  
“Sheriff's deputy? Police?” the woman whispered a prayer of thanks. “I-I’ve been wanting to call for days but I was afraid they'd think I was crazier than a fox in a henhouse.” her voice shook even more. “I can’t leave here. There are monsters in our fields. My husband went out to harvest the crops not a week ago and h-he… he was killed by something not human. Please, help me. My children will starve if we can’t get out soon.”

Her plea was more than I could process at once, but I eventually found my voice again. “I’m on my way, ma’am, don’t you worry.” I hung up and went out to my barn, where I grabbed my shotgun and a few boxes of ammo, then drove out to Sun Valley Farms. 

I had kept a police cruiser the county was taking out of commission when I retired. The sedan was no longer painted with our department logo, but anyone with some know-how of federal vehicles would recognize it by the sound of a too-powerful engine mixed with buildup after decades of the cheapest oil changes possible done much less often than necessary. Needless to say I wasn’t surprised to see a woman’s face peer out from the second floor as I pulled up.

I kept the barrel of my gun facing behind me and down as I walked to the door despite it not being loaded. I knocked once and waited, the sound of crops rustling in the breeze making me look over my shoulder more than once. But no hellhounds or vengeful corpses appeared. The door opened, and a tall, pale woman beckoned me in with a smile. 

“Thank you so much for coming, sir.”

The door closed and a boy around Chase’s age loomed from behind me, wielding a shovel. 

“You’ll do fine.”

My skull was nearly cracked in two before I could raise my shotgun.

Next I woke I was tied to a tree in a strip of forest near the edge of the cornfield, the farmhouse a dark cloud against the twilight sky. Blood had plastered to my face after rolling down from a gash on my head, and I spit it and dirt from my mouth to try and get rid of the taste. As I did so the woman who’d greeted me looked up from a fire to my left, and upon a second glance I recognized her from a photo of the new owners online as the owner’s wife, Abigail. Next to her sat the boy who’d hit me. 

“You little bastard,” I snarled. “What the hell is all this? Are you the ones controlling those God-forsaken corpses?”

“Don’t you talk like that around my mother you old goat,” the boy snapped. “Of course we don’t control those monsters.”

“Now now, Jacob,” Abigail soothed. “This man’s doing us a favor. And it’s natural he would be upset. He thinks we’re leaving him to die.”  


“What else is there to think?” I interrupted irately. 

The woman let out a breathy laugh. “Oh, honey, you aren't a sacrifice. You’re bait.” She rose from the fire, shadows gradually stretching across her face until she was engulfed in blackness as she approached my tree. “See I wasn’t pulling your leg entirely earlier,” she explained as she went around the tree and started to tighten my bindings. “My husband did die in this field. And I intend to kill the monster that did it.”

As Abigail explained, I kept a careful eye on her son. Jacob had taken my shotgun and leaned it against a nearby tree stump, and perched atop the stump a pistol shone in a patch of sun striking between the growing cloud cover. Angry as I was for the ambush, we were on the same side of this fight. “Do you know what the thing is?” I grunted doubtfully, hoping to buy myself some time. My binds felt too tight now, and I figured I could snap them once I had more information.

“It’s a demon,” Jacob retorted haughtily. “Honestly you come all the way out here and don’t even know that?”

I scowled and opened my mouth but Jacob’s mother spoke before I had the chance. “Hush,” She chided, glancing up at the darkening sky. “It won’t matter none what you say to a dead man.” Jacob appeared to mind his mother more than me, and they waited in silence until the moon was well into the sky. Finally Abigail gestured to Jacob and the two slipped away to perch in distant trees like fat pigeons. Jacob’s head anxiously jerking back and forth only added to the effect, and the thought calmed me enough to snort with amusement.

More time passed, and I waited for the two to retreat to safety so I could free myself. But they didn’t. Distracted by watching them, it took me a moment to realize the branches of a nearby tree were shaking. I snapped my binds and lumbered towards the stump on sore legs, grabbing my gun and resting it in the crook of my arm as I rubbed feeling back into my hands.

“Ma! He’s getting away!” Jacob shrieked, then jumped out of his tree. At once enormous, leathery bat wings extended from the top of the tree I’d noticed. The enormous shadow blotted out the swirl of midnight blues, and it let out a low growl as it crawled towards the end of a branch. The figure suddenly glided down from the tree, looming like an avenging gargoyle. The bonfire burst upwards with the surge of air, sending a flurry of sparks to graze ineffectively against leathery skin. The fire seemed to be matched by the creature’s narrowed eyes, which were locked onto Jacob like a predator. The beast flew at the boy, and he screamed with pain as it hooked bony hind limbs onto his shoulders with enormous claws. My hands shook slightly as I raised my shotgun and fired. It hit the demon’s shoulder and it bellowed with rage, dropping Jacob for a moment and rocketing towards me. I yelled with pain as I was slammed to the ground, but the wind got knocked out of me and I stopped with a desperate gasp for air. The demon’s claws dug into my chest and it leaned close. For a moment our eyes met, and I felt my body burn with heat like the fires of hell scorching my soul. I groped for my gun with my right hand, then propped it against the ground to point it at the demon’s face. I pressed down hard on the trigger and fired.

My ears rang as the gunshot sounded beside my ears. The monster screeched and bolted off of me, but kept itself low. Like a hawk its hind claws scoured into Jacob as it picked him up and rose into the night. My eyes weren’t good enough to track it, but I could hear Jacob’s screams long afterwards, laying powerless on the ground until I finally managed to stand up. 

“No!” Abigail screamed, then ran up to me, shaking my shoulders. “You could have saved him! What have you done?!” I coughed as she released me, wheezing as I tried to catch my breath while the world spun. “I ain't done nothing but try to help after the pair of you nearly got me killed,” I retorted angrily, then lightly grabbed her wrist to pull her along “Come on. I’ll take you to the nearest hotel.” I’d normally have offered a grieving woman with no place else to go a room for the night at my house, but I doubted she would want that and I certainly didn’t, either. 

We had to cross the entire cornfield before we got to my car, but not a soul bothered us as we ambled our way through. I opened the door for Jacob’s mother, then got in on the other side. The driveway was a long stretch of gravel road, and I gritted my teeth against the pain in my head. I turned onto the main road and Abigail screamed as my headlights illuminated a line of decaying corpses and dogs slowly walking towards us. Another line was already starting to form behind us. I tried not to look at the younger faces, but three of them were wearing orange jumpsuits with the name of the local jail stitched on their chest. With a prayer for forgiveness I pressed hard down on the gas and charged towards the line. Two of the bodies thumped against the front bumper, then went sailing towards the side of the road. I sped away, glancing back in my rearview mirror to see the two shambling unconcerned from the ditch.

Neither Abigail nor I spoke as I drove to the nearest motel and parked. As she left though, I tipped my hat to her. “I am sorry about your boy, ma’am. You best stay away from that farm. I’m gonna go back and I’ll save him, if I can.”

She wiped her sleeve against her dripping nose. “Thank you, sir. After what we done…”  
My eyes darkened, and I thought about the picture frame at home. I looked away. “I lost my wife two years back. Natural causes. But I know what it feels like to want revenge on the world.” With another nod I made my way back to my house.

The first thing that was off when I got home was the front door. It had been left open. I knew sure as the sun shines that I had locked it, but I assumed Chase had let his friend in and hadn’t been bothered to close the door after himself. I started to become more suspicious, however, when I saw a lithe shape quickly striding towards me. 

“What the devil are you doing out here, Wesson?” I muttered as I scratched the old tomcat between the ears. I usually only let him outside when the rats in the barn got too bad. On colder nights like this he preferred to curl on top of the air vents inside the house and be blasted by the heat. Now the black cat meowed amiably and pushed his way between my legs before leading the way to the barn. 

“You leave a rat for me to eat again?” I asked with a sigh as I followed. Wesson just meowed again, more eagerly this time as he dashed for the nearest stall. I reached for the string to the nearest lightbulb as I entered, but it didn’t turn on. “Great,” I muttered. “Come on, Wesson. It’s late. Get back to the house now. I can see your rat later.” The cat didn’t respond, so I started walking to the front of the barn to turn on the other light, narrowing my eyes to see in the darkness. But before I reached it my wife’s old horse, Delilah let out a high-pitched whinny. “Damn it cat.” I grumbled, detouring into the stall. “You’re gonna get yourself killed.” I opened the latch to let myself inside, my foot stomping down on a thin wire, causing a net to drop on top of me. I stumbled and I reached up instinctively to protect my face, expecting to be kicked, but Delilah wasn’t in her usual stall. Instead the smell of tuna hit my nose as I saw Wesson purring as he finished eating from a tuna tin. He padded over to me as I fell, then turned away, his nose twitching. Another tin of tuna was perched on top of a pallet. Wesson wriggled his haunches and leaped on top of it. He yowled as the pallet clattered to the ground, and ropes with spray cans attached descended from the ceiling, spraying me all over with something that smelled like lavender.

All of a sudden the lights turned on, and a chorus of obnoxiously pleased laughter came from the front entrance of the barn. The lights turned on and saw a boy I assumed was Travis, with Chase sure to be right beside him.  
“We did it!” Chase cheered out of my old listening device, muffled by Travis’ hoodie pocket. “I hope it works-” his voice faltered. “Oh shit are you alright?” he asked me.

“I’m fine,” I retorted. “You’re lucky I don’t skin you both and feed you to the hogs. Tonight is not the night to be playing games with me.”

“We’re not. We’ve beaten you,” Chase replied eagerly. “We found a spray that makes you unable to use your own equipment.”

My interest peaked. “Well get this thing off me and let’s see it then.” 

Travis came and helped me up, and I appreciated the attempt at manners. I lead the way back to my house, limping slightly now after tripping. Without a word I went to the basement and reached for one of my inventions: a mashup of tires that I had been trying to transform into a mannequin for the boy. 

My hand swerved around the conglomerate, like my hand had fallen asleep and could only graze numbly over the surface. 

“What in the world?”

“We spent all afternoon coming up with that spray,” Travis explained. “Trying to make sure I couldn’t touch the stuff. We had some pretty interesting results.” He stuck out his tongue, which was now a bright, fluorescent orange. I managed my second laugh that day. “Well however you done it, I think that just about puts a stop to my gadgets. We should talk about what we’re gonna do now.” I went back upstairs and relaxed into my chair, nearly falling asleep instantly with relief. “We’re dealing with a demon,” I began, about to start my story.  
“We know.” Chase interrupted. “Gabbie had a picture of it on her phone.”

“Oh and get this,” Travis burst out. “The family that lived there? A few years back they had a modest harvest season, but their biggest competitor?” he paused for dramatic effect. “Pest infestation. The next year the farmer got diagnosed with cancer, but it was treated just like that.” He snapped his fingers. 

“Any idea on how to kill it?”

“No,” Chase’s voice echoed from my bedroom and Travis’ pocket. “Not yet. But we can think of a way.”

I slumped farther down in my chair. “That Jacob boy don’t have much time. But I need to rest first.”  
”If you ask me, he got what’s coming for him.” Travis scoffed, his shoes scuffing against the floorboards as he paced. “Even if his family wasn’t involved with the demon, they didn’t give a shit if anyone else was hurt as long as they got revenge.” He stopped in his tracks then fished out his keys. “But leave it to us for now. I can drink a Red Bull and go for hours.”

“I’m not disappearing before I’ve had the chance to kill this thing,” Chase agreed. “We’ll start working on a plan. We managed to beat you easily enough,” he taunted good-humoredly. 

I didn’t bother taking the bait. “Well have at it,” I yawned. “I'm going to sleep. I’m no use to anyone exhausted and beaten half to hell.”

I didn’t hear if either of them replied, drifting off a few moments after Travis shut the door, then drove back to his house.

So that about does it. We have some more information on what’s going on now, but I don’t know what use it is. My equipment isn’t liable to kill a demon, but maybe I can cook something up while I’m taking it easy.

**(Chase’s Note: Dennis is right that we need to move fast. I think this will be the last opportunity I’ll have to get revenge before I disappear. Not to mention I don’t know how many more chances we'll have to leave those fields alive. Either way,  we’re all ears.)**
