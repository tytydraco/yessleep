Part 3: Thrice the Power (NSFW/CW: Gore, Primal urges, brutality)

The peaceful facade of our quiet suburban neighborhood had been shattered again. It wasn't long after our last encounter that we noticed the new neighbors moving in. This time, it was a group, not a family, and their presence felt wrong from the start. There were rumors - whispers about young women going missing in nearby towns, about bodies found with signs of horrific torture.

This wasn't just another predator; it was a pack of them, serial killers hiding behind the masks of friendly neighbors. They targeted young women, girls in their teens, and the thought of their twisted pleasure filled me with a familiar, dark rage. Mae and I knew we couldn't handle this alone. We needed someone with skills that matched our own. Navah was the perfect choice.

Navah was an old friend back in my hometown, a hunter like us, with a specialty in tracking and dismantling groups of killers. She was relentless and resourceful, with a sharp mind and a fierce spirit. When I called her, she didn't hesitate. By the next evening, she was at our doorstep, ready for action.

We gathered in my dimly lit living room, our faces grim as we laid out the plan.
The killers had to be stopped before they claimed another victim. We decided to strike at night, when their guard would be down, and the darkness would give us the advantage.

Navah scouted the area, identifying the layout of their house and noting the patterns of their movements. Mae and I prepared our gear, each item meticulously chosen for its purpose. We went over the plan again and again, ensuring every detail was covered. This had to be flawless, perfect without a flaw in a sense.

The night was moonless, the perfect cover for our approach. We moved like shadows, silent and unseen, slipping through the neighborhood toward the killers' house. Navah took the lead, her expertise in stealth guiding us to the back entrance. Mae and I followed, our senses heightened, ready for anything.

Navah picked the lock with ease, and we slipped inside. The house was dark, but we navigated through it with practiced ease, our night-vision goggles giving us the edge. We found the basement door, slightly ajar, and heard faint, muffled cries. The sound fueled our determination.

We descended the stairs, weapons ready. The basement was a nightmare - bloodstained walls, makeshift cells, and the tools of their gruesome trade. The killers were gathered around their latest victim, a terrified young girl, bound and gagged. They didn't see us coming.

Navah struck first, her blade slicing through the air with deadly precision. Mae and I followed, engaging the others in a brutal dance of death. The killers fought back, but they were no match for our combined skill and fury. Blood splattered the walls as we dispatched them one by one, each kill methodical and precise. Mae, then released the girl from her restraints and let her go. 

In the chaos, one of them tried to escape. Mae intercepted him, her movements swift and lethal. As the last killer fell, silence descended, the air thick with the scent of blood and fear.

The basement was a symphony of blood and silence. The killers' bodies lay strewn across the floor, their lifeless forms testament to our victory. Navah and Mae were talking softly, their voices blending into the background noise of the aftermath. But their words were indistinguishable to me. My mind was elsewhere, consumed by a dark, primal hunger that surged within me.

The sight of the viscera, the metallic scent of blood, aroused something primal inside me. It was a hunger that burned deep in my gut, a craving for release that demanded satisfaction. “Oh fuck me sideways…” I cursed under my breath, feeling the fire of desire roaring to life.

I wanted them both, right here, right now, amidst the blood and gore of our enemies. The thought of having feral sex with Mae and Navah, covered in the blood of the demons we had just slain, made my pulse race with anticipation. When I voiced my desires, they giggled in understanding, their lust mirroring my own.

I wanted to see their luscious bodies covered in viscera, to taste the blood of the hunt on their skin. I wanted to devour them, to eat them out ravenously, feeling their pleasure and warmth as they surrendered their hunger to me. Knowing me, my hunger knew no bounds, and I longed to show them the depths of my desire.

As we came together in a frenzy of passion, I made them feel every inch of me, every rough touch and urgent thrust. I wanted them to know that if I didn't have a code to live by, if I didn't have a moral sense guiding me, I would want nothing more than for the police to find us in the midst of our primal union, lost in the heat of the moment amidst the piles of hot flesh and warm blood.

As the last echoes of our passion faded into the stillness of the basement, we lay tangled together, our bodies slick with sweat and blood. The bond between us had deepened, forged anew in the fires of violence and lust.
We were more than just hunters; we were comrades bound by the darkest parts of ourselves, a connection that transcended the horrors we faced.

As we rose and began to clean ourselves and the scene, there was a silent understanding between us. The hunt would continue, the darkness within us ever present. But we had each other, and in that, we found a twisted sense of solace and strength.

With a final glance at the carnage we had wrought, we made our way out of the basement, leaving behind the remnants of our victory. The night was far from over, and there were still demons to hunt. But as we stepped out into the cool night air, I knew that together, we were unstoppable. And as long as we stood united, no darkness could ever truly overcome us.
