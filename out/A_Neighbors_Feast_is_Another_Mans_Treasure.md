Part 2: The Experimenter Who Preyed on the Weak (ft. Mae Rokubi)

**this chapter of my life gets SAUCY**

The dust had barely settled from the last encounter when I noticed another
moving truck pull into the neighborhood. My eyes narrowed as I watched the new arrival step out - a hulking figure, taller and broader than most, with an unsettling calmness in his movements. Something about him set my instincts on edge. I don’t like this…not one bit.

Days passed, and whispers began circulating, strange sounds, the occasional muffled cry, and the sight of men entering but not leaving the house. It was time to act. This new neighbor wasn't just another predator; he was something else entirely, a twisted experimenter who preyed on the weak.

This was more than I could handle alone. I needed backup, someone who shared my dark expertise. Mae Rokubi was the only person I trusted for this.

We had met years ago, bound by our mutual mission to hunt the demons in human skin. Mae was as deadly as she was beautiful, with eyes that could pierce through any lie and a prowess that matched my own.

I called Mae, explaining the situation in terse, coded language. She understood immediately. By nightfall, she was at my door, her presence a reassuring reminder that I wasn't alone in this fight. 

Mae and I had a history of working seamlessly together. Her agility and sharp mind complemented my brute force and instinct. As we prepared, Mae donned her gear with the same calm precision I had seen in her countless times before. Her eyes met mine, and a silent agreement passed between us - we were ready.

Under the cover of darkness, we approached the house. Mae moved like a shadow, slipping through the yard with a grace that seemed almost supernatural. I followed, our movements synchronized by years of practice. We reached a side window, peering inside to confirm our
suspicions.

The scene was worse than I had imagined. The hulking neighbor stood over a restrained figure, tools of torture meticulously laid out on a table. Mae's eyes flashed with anger, and I felt my own blood boil. We had seen horrors, but the sight of this man's twisted pleasure in tormenting others ignited a fury within us both. Silently, we communicated our plan - Mae would create a distraction while I went in for the takedown.

She moved to the front, throwing a rock through a window to draw the monster's attention. As he turned, I slipped inside, using the noise to mask my entry. Mae's diversion worked perfectly; the man moved towards the source of the noise, giving me the opening I needed. 

I struck with precision, immobilizing him before he even realized what was happening. Mae joined me, her eyes cold and determined. We secured him, ensuring he wouldn't be a threat while we freed his latest victim. The man was barely conscious, his body bearing the marks of his captor's cruelty.

Mae and I exchanged a glance, knowing what needed to be done. This wasn't just about stopping one monster; it was about sending a message. 

The thrill of the hunt, the raw power I felt as I took down the hulking neighbor, coursed through me like a raging inferno. My heart pounded with a dark excitement, and the sight of blood and viscera intensified the feeling. The man's lifeless body, the gore splattered across the room - it all fed the fire inside me, awakening a primal hunger that needed release.

As Mae and I stood over the remains of the experimenter, the air thick with the metallic scent of blood, I felt an undeniable urge. The violence, the chaos - it aroused something deep within me, a dark desire that demanded satisfaction. My breath came in heavy gasps, and I turned to Mae, my eyes burning with intensity.

"Mae," | said, my voice rough with barely contained need, "I need your help with something else. Right now."

She looked at me, her eyes reflecting the same dark fire. Mae understood the depths of my desires, having shared similar experiences. Without a word, she nodded, a silent agreement passing between us. The tension between us crackled, electric and undeniable.

In the midst of the potential crime scene, we gave in to our pent-up feral urges. The adrenaline from the night's events, combined with the sight and smell of death, drove us to a place of primal need. We tore at each other's clothes, the urgency of our desire overriding any thoughts of restraint, “Fuck yes.” I remember saying that.

Covered in the experimenter's blood, we ravaged each other and came together with a ferocity that mirrored the violence we had just enacted. The viscera beneath us added a macabre element to our union, heightening the intensity of our connection. Every touch, every movement was charged with a raw, animalistic passion.

When it was over, we lay entwined on the blood-soaked floor, breathing heavily. The feral sex had not only satisfied our physical needs but had also strengthened our partnership. In the aftermath of the carnage, we found a twisted sense of peace and unity.

As we lost ourselves in the moment, the boundaries between us blurred. Our bodies moved in perfect sync, driven by the same dark hunger. The satisfaction of our primal urges brought us even closer, forging a bond deeper than before.

We left enough evidence for the authorities to find, ensuring the hulking neighbor would face justice, but we took our own measures to ensure he wouldn't harm anyone again.

As the sun began to rise, Mae and I stood side by side, the weight of our mission settling over us. Another demon in human skin had been dealt with, but our work was far from over.

Mae and I were more than just hunters now. We were bound by our shared darkness, our desires intertwined with our mission. Together, we would continue to hunt the demons in human skin, knowing that our connection made us stronger, more formidable. And the fire that fueled us would burn ever brighter, as long as there were monsters to face and evil to eradicate.

We were bound by our dark purpose, hunters in a world where evil wore many faces. And together, we would continue to hunt, bringing justice to those who preyed on the innocent.
