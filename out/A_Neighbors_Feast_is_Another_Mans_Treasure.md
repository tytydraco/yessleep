Part 1: [NSFW up ahead]

Hey my name is Michael, friends call me Mike. Whatever is easiest for you to remember. For context, before I met my neighbors, I was just a nobody, blending into the darkness like a shadow. I looked ordinary, with eyes that hid secrets. I dressed in dull colors, reflecting the darkness inside me. I’m a tall, average built dude with dark hair and blue eyes. There’s nothing that makes “unique” in the everyday world. But I did know one thing about me that no one else would read into.

Survival was like breathing to me, something I learned from facing scary stuff. My past weighed heavy on me, full of dark memories. Even though I tried to seem normal, there was a darkness inside me that wouldn't go away. It wanted more, something beyond the boring life I lived.

When I first saw the moving truck pull up to the old Victorian house next door, I felt a mix of curiosity and unease. The house had been vacant for years, an abandoned shell that seemed to swallow light and hope. I watched from my window as the new neighbors, Katherine and John, unloaded their belongings. They moved with an eerie synchronicity, their faces hidden beneath wide-brimmed hats.

I decided to introduce myself, to be a good neighbor and all. With a bottle of some cheap wine in hand, I crossed the lawn and knocked on their door. A young woman by the name of Katherine answered, her pale face breaking into a smile that didn't reach her cold, dark eyes. Her straight brown hair covered half her face, almost in a sense of hiding behind a sheer curtain. “Hello, neighbor. Won’t you come in?” She invited me in, her voice a soft purr. I won’t lie, it was soft but sultry in a way, almost lustful, orgasmic.

The house was dimly lit, filled with shadows and strange smells. I tried not to wrinkle my nose at the pungent aroma that hung in the air. Katherine led me to the dining room where her husband, John stood carving what looked like a roast. He glanced up, his eyes gleaming with a predatory hunger.

"Oh! Hey there, bud," he said, his voice smooth, but raspy and steady. He chuckled as he continued carving the “roast,” "We were just about to have dinner. Care to join us?"

I hesitated, but Katherine's insistent grip on my arm propelled me forward. I sat at the table, the wooden chair creaking beneath me. Plates were set before us, filled with an array of meats that looked almost... wrong.
"Is this beef?" | asked, picking up my knife and fork.

"Something like that," John replied with a sly smile, snickering devilishly under his breath. ”We enjoy trying exotic flavors."
Katherine watched me intently as I took a bite. The meat was tender, almost too tender, and a coppery tang lingered on my tongue. I forced myself to swallow, my stomach churning. The couple exchanged a glance, their eyes glittering with amusement and something darker.

As the night wore on, their stories became increasingly bizarre. Tales of hunting trips where their prey was never quite defined, of strange rituals and secret societies. Each tale dripped with a sinister undertone that set my nerves on edge.

It wasn't until I excused myself to use the bathroom that I stumbled upon their secret. Wandering down a dimly lit hallway, I opened a door to find a room lined with freezers. Curiosity got the better of me, and I opened one. Inside, wrapped in butcher paper, were limbs and torsos, unmistakably human. My breath caught in my throat as the realization hit me.

**Katherine and John were cannibals.**

They had been serving me human flesh, the remains of their victims. Men, women, elderly. Christ… Suddenly, a hand clamped down on my shoulder. I spun around to find Katherine standing there, her smile now a mask of malevolence. Her smile cut daggers into my flesh, "You weren't supposed to see that," she hissed.

They led me back to the dining room, their demeanor now openly threatening.
The atmosphere had shifted; the room seemed to close in around me. I could see it in their eyes — I was their next meal.
But what they didn't know was that I had my own dark secret. For years, I had hunted creatures like them, demons in human skin who preyed on the innocent. I had an appetite for such monsters.

As they advanced on me, knives gleaming, I let my facade drop. I moved with a speed and precision that caught them off guard, disarming John and turning his blade against him. Blood sprayed across the walls as I slit his throat. Katherine screamed, her face contorted with rage and fear, but her screams soon turned into maniacal laughter.

I tackled her to the ground, pinning her beneath me. Her strength was surprising, but l was stronger. I whispered in her ear, "You picked the wrong neighbor." With a swift motion, I plunged a steak knife into her chest cavity, her blood pooling beneath us.

I stood up, covered in their blood, and looked around the room. It was a gruesome scene, but necessary. The world was rid of two more predators. I cleaned up as best as I could, disposing of their bodies in the very freezers they had used for their victims.

As the blood sprayed across the walls and the room filled with the metallic scent of fresh death, a shiver of exhilaration coursed through my body. The warm, sticky viscera of Katherine and John clung to my skin, and I felt a surge of primal satisfaction. Each drop of their blood on my hands, each piece of their flesh splattered around me, awakened something deep within - a hunger, a dark thrill that I had long kept buried. “F-Fuck…”

Covered in their viscera, I was acutely aware of the pulse of life that had just been snuffed out by my hands. It was intoxicating, this power over the monsters who had preyed on others.

The sight of their lifeless bodies, the sheer carnage of it all, ignited a fierce, almost feral arousal within me. I was no longer just Michael, the unassuming neighbor. In that moment, I was the hunter, reveling in the visceral, bloody justice I had dealt.

When I got home, the adrenaline still pulsed through me, an electric current that wouldn't let go. The memory of their blood and viscera, the raw power I felt, was overwhelming. My heart pounded as I stumbled into my bathroom, my reflection in the mirror showing a man transformed by the night's violence.

The thrill of the hunt, the intoxicating mix of fear and power, consumed my thoughts. I needed an outlet, a way to release the pent-up energy and dark excitement coursing through me. Stripping off my blood-soaked clothes, I leaned against the cold sink, my breath coming in ragged gasps.

With trembling hands, I gave in to the primal urge, seeking relief from the chaos and carnage that still lingered in my mind. The act was both desperate and cathartic, a dark ritual to cleanse myself of the night's horrors. As the release finally came, I felt a twisted sense of satisfaction, the remnants of the night's bloodshed finally beginning to wash away. God, I need a drink and a smoke after this.

When the police arrived the next day, tipped off by an anonymous call, they found the house empty except for the macabre evidence of Katherine and John's crimes. I watched from my window, satisfied that justice had been served.

The neighborhood was safer…for now, but I knew my work was far from over. There were always more monsters to hunt, and my appetite for them was insatiable.
