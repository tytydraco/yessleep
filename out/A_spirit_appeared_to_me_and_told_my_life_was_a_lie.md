I was 13 when I first saw the gray woman.

I would wake up to her sitting at the foot of my bed early in the morning, watching me in eerie silence.

From the very first time, I knew she wasn’t… alive. She felt like a spirit or something.

Her skin was almost translucent, and her face looked like a patch of dark gray that faded when I tried to get closer. A fog shaped like a person.

Most girls my age would’ve been terrified—but I wasn’t. Her presence gave me a strange sense of peace at a time I desperately needed it, and I never told my mother about her.

I already had enough problems without adding ghosts to the list.

Back then, I spent most of my time inside my house, isolated and drinking endless homemade remedies my mother prepared. Worst of all, I had to endure the weekly head shavings she insisted on.

I’d been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder before I could even remember, and one of the side effects was constant hair loss, leaving my scalp patchy and bare. 

So, for as long as I can recall, she used to shave it all off—like a cancer patient going through chemo. But weekly.

As you can imagine, after the diagnosis, my mother became quite protective.

We lived on the outskirts of a small town, right next to the church where my father preached. Despite how serious my condition was, my parents never wanted to take me to the town’s only hospital. My mother believed in natural healing—herbs, infusions, and daily prayer.

School was rough. The other kids mocked my appearance behind my back, and I never really made any friends.

As I moved through my teenage years, still mostly alone, the gray woman began appearing in my bed almost every morning. She became a quiet, near-constant presence. I knew she wasn’t malicious—her eyes looked more sorrowful than anything.

Then one morning, I woke up—and she wasn’t at the foot of the bed.

She was right next to me, face to face, her mouth close to my ear and, before vanishing like she always did, she finally spoke. 

“You are not sick.”

*** 

The next day, I was shaken. She had never spoken before.

And not sick? I’d always been ill—since birth, according to my mother.

I was then sixteen, and I couldn’t say I hadn’t started questioning some elements of her story already, but why would she lie about something like that?

The remedies she gave me were indeed odd. They were supposed to cure my nausea and pain but only seemed to make things worse.

What the gray woman said made me question it all even more.

That afternoon, I helped my father clean the church for the next day’s service, but my mind was somewhere else, stuck on her words and what they could possibly mean.

That night at dinner, my mother kept asking what was wrong, why I was so quiet. When I told her it was nothing, she offered me one of her “special blends” to lift my mood. I said no, stood up from the table, and walked to my room, catching the stunned look on both their faces.

I needed answers. I needed to understand what the woman meant, and hoped she would come back that night.

And she did.

She came again in the early morning, again with her mouth at my ear. And this time, I saw clearly the shape of a bright red hair in the gray as she whispered something new:

“Search the blue in the barn.”

*** 

“The barn? We don’t have a barn!” That’s all I could think about the next morning.

Did I hear her right? Was this barn somewhere else? There were dozens of barns around here, and none of them were ours.

All day, I tried to figure out the mystery—through breakfast, and later during my father’s Sunday sermon. 

While he was going on about Abraham and Sarah and the importance of trusting God—a story I’ve heard a thousand times—I remembered something.

This whole property was once a farm my father bought to build this church when he came to this town. In the year I was born.

I recalled seeing some old photos of him—young and determined—hammering the first nails that would become our home.

The older farm buildings were all torn down, except one that my father used as a storage room.

Could it have once been a barn?

That might explain why the woman appears. Maybe she lived here once.

After the service, I sneaked in there.

It was filled with cobwebs and completely dark. I had to bring a candle.

No one had set foot there in a long time, except to dump old junk. The room was full of piles of paper, old suitcases, rusty tools, and broken appliances.

I rummaged around for a while until I found something that felt important. It was a suitcase, a very pale blue, the kind that went out of fashion thirty years ago.

Maybe this is the blue she talked about.

Inside, there were dozens of old photos I’d never seen—taken before I was born, back when my parents lived in another state.

My mother rarely spoke about that time, and I assumed it had been difficult.

But looking at those pictures, I got a completely different impression. There were photos of my father’s old church, packed and full of congregants.

There were pictures of dinners, celebrations, services. A lively community. And in most of those photos, always close to my parents, was a young woman with red hair and a huge smile.

It was her. I was certain. The gray woman.

She seemed to be a key part of my father’s church back then. From the look of it, they were very close.

There were photos of her helping him with Sunday sermons, even cooking with my mother in the house they used to live in.

I was stunned. 

In one of the pictures, I found her name written—Harper.

And in one of my father’s old planners, I found a few phone numbers, mostly from people they probably cut ties long ago. Her name was written there too.

I took the planner and went back home.

My mother and father were still at the church. It was the perfect chance to make the call and maybe get some answers about who this Harper is and why she's here.

It was an old number—it probably wouldn’t work—but it was my best shot.

I dialed. It rang and no one picked it up.

Tried again. Nothing.

Just as I was about to give up, a tired, curt woman’s voice answered on the other end of the third try.

“Who is it?” she asked.

I said my name and told her I was looking for Harper.

Only silence came for a few seconds. Then the voice returned.

“I don’t know what this prank is, but it’s not funny. My daughter died a long time ago.”

“It’s not a prank,” I said, now realizing who I was talking to. “I think your daughter worked with my father and mother a long time ago. My father is a pastor, and I found some pictures with—”

“Stop right there,” she cut me off, her voice suddenly heavy with emotion. “Are you the daughter of Patrick?”

“Yes, I am,” I replied. “Of Patrick and Donna.”

“No, you are not!” she shouted, startling me.

Then silence again.

Followed by what sounded like quiet sobbing.

“Let me tell you, my child,” she came back. “The truth about who you are.”

***

I didn’t eat dinner that night.

I went straight to my room and locked the door. 

All I wanted was to fall asleep—hoping I’d see Harper one more time, now that I knew the truth.

But it took a while to fall asleep. The voice of the woman from the call kept echoing in my head.

Her stories about… how Harper had been one of my father’s most loyal followers.

About how they brought her into their home, where she became a servant for both the church and the family.

About how they used her to carry a child, since my mother couldn’t have one.

About how, after giving birth, Harper vanished completely—and my parents conveniently moved to a different state a week later.

About how she was my real mother.

***

But the gray woman didn’t come that night.

The one who woke me in the morning was my other mother, calling for me. A week had passed—it was time to shave my head again.

Still groggy from a restless night, I followed her to the bathroom and stepped into the shower, where our routine always took place.

As she turned on the clippers in that messy, dimly lit bathroom, I found myself wondering why she does this.

Why cut my hair? Why keep me sick?

Even if what Harper said was true, I still didn’t understand the reason.

But as she started running the machine over my scalp, line by line, and I saw those nearly invisible strands of red hair falling—bright, unmistakably red—I started comparing them to her jet-black hair.

And I realized something:

With my head shaved clean and kept on isolation, no one—at church, at the market, anywhere—would ever question whether I was truly her daughter.

Her servant’s ghost would be forever a ghost. 

And that thought alone sent a rage through me I’d never felt before.

When she stepped out of the bathroom for a second to grab something, I opened the drawer and took a pair of scissors.

And when she came near me to finish the shaving, I drove them into her neck with everything I had.
