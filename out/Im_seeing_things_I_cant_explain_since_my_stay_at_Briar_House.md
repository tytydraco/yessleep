I was forty thousand words into drafting my novel when it all turned to shit. I was trying to wrangle a cohesive draft from the sections spread out across notebooks, phone apps, half-written docs files, and scribbles on napkins, but I'd lost grip on what I found so exciting about the story and now it seemed thin and overwrought. My confidence had slipped just as much as my deadlines, and nothing I was doing to fix either was working. I was starting to dread sitting down at my laptop, feeling doubt and inertia gripping my fingers as I typed and deleted out sections that were too cliched, too obvious, simply not good enough.

One late night, scrolling distractedly through listings for secluded getaways, I found Briar House B&B, located in a sleepy retirement town about 3 hours away from the city. The photos showed a tall, wood-clad property with flower boxes at every window, surrounded by a wide, open lawn that bordered on evergreen forest. The listing boasted chef-prepared breakfasts, quiet rooms filled with antique furniture, and "a garden with whimsical touches" bordering on nothing but rolling hills and forest in the distance. The price was reasonable, and I figured if I stayed a couple of weeks, I might finally finish the book. And if I didn't . . . well, at least I'd have a quiet place to recharge completely and return to my draft with fresh eyes.

I drove away from home feeling excited for the first time in weeks, feeling the old tension being replaced with the energy of new potential coiled up inside my body. The roads became quieter and narrower as the city rolled away behind me, and as the pink light of dusk started to fall, I pulled into the gravel driveway of Briar House.

The first thing I noticed wasn't the floral-curtained house or the manicured lawns sprawling into the distance, but the hundreds of model houses. A village of scale replicas each a foot or so tall, with chalets, log cabins, and farmyard barns clustered around the bases of the trees, complete with tiny balconies and decks. Each one was meticulously painted and varnished in cheery colors with leafy plants, small rocks and mosses tucked in around them. Dribbling streams ran down piled rockeries where houses sat clustered on every simulated peak and valley, with orange lights shining from their tiny windows. There were even bird houses nailed to trees with vaulted roofs and tiny windows.

And then . . . I noticed the garden gnomes. Jolly-looking figures with rosy cheeks and pointed hats arranged all around the garden, nestled in ferns and posed under tree branches. Every type of gnome you could imagine were all there, from regular bearded gnomes, to younger ones with painted twinkles in their eyes, to gnomes dressed as chefs or doctors or farmers. Most of them looked happy and innocent, while others had a mischievous gleam in their eyes.

It was a kitsch paradise—charming, but also faintly unsettling. This was whimsical on a whole other level. Undoubtedly, this fairy kingdom was the labour of a lifetime, and I wondered what sort of person had created all of this—what sort of person would find this endearing and not remotely sinister.

I parked my car, feeling like I was being watched by hundreds of tiny eyes. I took a deep breath, put on my best polite smile, and walked toward the front door.

Before I reached the door, it opened and an older couple emerged, wide smiles creasing their kindly faces.

“Welcome to Briar House, dear!” the woman called, waving as she walked toward me. She was short and wiry, with grey curled hair and a floral apron tied around her waist. “You must be Jade! I’m Evelyn Hampton, and this is my husband, Robert.” She clasped my hand warmly with both hands as the man, tall and lean with thinning hair, nodded in greeting.

“We’re very pleased to have you,” he added. His voice was soft and slow, spoken as if he was savoring each word. “We don’t often have guests stay as long as two weeks. You’ll feel right at home, I’m sure.”

I smiled at him, imagining him painting each house with a look of intense concentration. “Thank you. The place is beautiful,” I replied, glancing around, though my gaze kept drifting back to the gnomes. Mrs Hampton caught my look and laughed quietly.

“I see you're admiring our little village!” she said with sparkling eyes. “It has a way of catching people’s attention. The gnomes keep an eye on things around here, don’t they, Robert?”

Robert nodded, his lips curling into a smile. “Yes, they do. They’re part of what makes Briar House so special.”

I tried not to make my laugh in response sound nervous, and followed them inside.

The inside of the house was much more kitsch than the photos had shown—lace tablecloths, floral prints, and everything delicately framed in faded pastels. My room was very quaint, with rose-print wallpaper and a crochet-blanketed bed that looked like it belonged in a story book. In one corner was an old-fashioned baby pram, and inside were two old-fashioned dolls staring up at me. The dolls had been arranged just so, in eyelet lace dresses with their china faces frozen in serene, eerie little smiles.

As they served up casserole and freshly baked bread, the Hamptons told me how Briar House had been their "special home" for 26 years now, and how the land had always been a place where “guests feel like they belong.” Robert proudly detailed all the work that had gone into creating the model village outside, and wryly complained about all the ongoing maintenance it needed. Evelyn talked about her love of hosting guests from all corners of the world, and happily took my order for breakfast the next day.

There was something a little unusual about the way they spoke, with pronounced pauses and each word spoken almost carefully, as if each phrase was being picked quite deliberately. Still, they came across as warm, if a little formal. Mrs Hampton wore a tiny gold crucifix, and they certainly seemed like straight-laced religious types—I couldn't imagine either of them angry, or cursing.

The dinner was delicious, and I fell asleep almost straight away when I collapsed on the bed upstairs.

The next morning, I woke up with a dull ache in my head and a heaviness in my limbs. I hoped it was just fatigue from travelling. I really didn't want to be getting sick—I had a nasty habit of falling ill as soon as I went on holiday, as if the moment my body slowed down, my defences also lowered. I dragged myself out of bed and headed downstairs for breakfast, where Mrs. Hampton was waiting. The table was laid meticulously with several sets of silver cutlery, gold-edged side plates, and a vase of fresh dahlias.

“Good morning, dear! How are you this morning?” she asked, patting my arm as she handed me a plate piled high with eggs, toast, and sausages. When I told her I had a bit of a headache, she almost instantly produced painkillers with a big glass of orange juice. “Eat up, every bite. A good breakfast is the best medicine.”

She was an attentive host, and insisted on changing the sheets on my bed every morning. I'd taken to leaving a cross-stitched cushion on top of the pram in my room each night to avoid feeling creeped out by the dolls' staring eyes, so I was careful to remove the cushion each morning and put it back in its place, to avoid offending Mrs Hampton.

That morning I sat down with my laptop in the garden, trying to ignore the heaviness in my limbs as I took in my surroundings. I’d come here to write, and the change of scenery was definitely an improvement on how boxed-in I was feeling within the walls of my city apartment. This place was beautiful—peculiar, but beautiful. The garden was full of blooming flowers, the leaves of the forest rustled in the breeze like the sound of distant waves, and light danced through the foliage. As I forced myself to write, the words finally seemed to be coming more easily.

By the third morning, though, an uncomfortable truth had become apparent: the gnomes were moving.

When I started noticing it I had tried to brush it off, telling myself that maybe I just hadn’t noticed where they were before. But this time was different. When I’d gone to bed, each gnome had been neatly arranged in clusters under the bushes and along the flower beds. But as I opened my curtains at dawn, I froze—the gnomes were lined up in a perfect row along the path in front of my room, and even though I was high above them it looked like they were looking towards my window, their tiny painted eyes staring up at me.

At first I thought it had to be some kind of prank, but I definitely couldn't imagine the Hamptons doing anything like that. I tried and failed to rationalize what I was seeing, so much so that I started doubting my own eyes, and I decided to go down to look closer. I crept down the stairs and out the front door, down to the path where they stood, arranged perfectly parallel with my bedroom window. I barely had time to process the scene when I heard a noise from the house behind me.

Mr Hampton was up early, standing on the porch in his usual starched shirt as he surveyed the yard. I quickly hid behind a tree, watching as he walked to collect each gnome, one by one, carefully placing them back into their original positions under bushes and along flower beds.

“They like things just so,” Mrs Hampton had said to me the day before. “They have a way of arranging themselves, don’t they, dear?”

In the days that followed I watched Mr Hampton rearrange the gnomes. If I woke early enough, I’d find them in some strange new arrangement—standing in lines, or gathered in solemn little circles. And each morning, Mr Hampton would rise at dawn to put them all back.

I still didn't know what I was seeing, or how I should be feeling. Should I be curious, and amused? Was this behaviour the work of a strange old man with nothing better to do, or was something more sinister occurring? I had no evidence that anything was wrong as such, but there was a growing feeling in my chest that I couldn't ignore—a tense, twisting anxiety. It was as though the gnomes were sending a silent message to me, but I couldn't understand what they were trying to say. I spent more and more time thinking about it, making it harder to even think about writing.

One morning, I woke and instinctively reached up to touch the necklace I always wore—a small silver locket that had belonged to my mother—only to find it missing. Panic rose over me like a wave. I tore through my bags, lifted up couch cushions, checked under the bed. But it was gone.

When I mentioned it to Mrs Hampton, she didn't seem too concerned. “Oh, we’ll keep an eye out for it,” she said, her tone as pleasant as ever, though it felt like her gaze lingered on me a moment too long. “Things have a way of turning up around here.”

The day went on, but there was a thick knot of disappointment inside me . . . disappointment that I had been so careless to lose one of the only mementos I had of her. My neck felt naked without the comforting weight of it. Its loss left me feeling unmoored, like a boat drifting away from the shores of my own life.

On the fifth morning I woke with a hacking cough, covered with clammy sweat, and my bed was cold and damp. My forehead burned and my throat felt raw and dry. I came downstairs to find Mr Hampton in the kitchen, serving breakfast. I greeted him weakly and explained I wasn't feeling any better as he studied me with his dark eyes. He excused himself to attend to the grounds while I sat limp and shovelled the food into my mouth, hoping that the food would make me feel more human.

When Mrs Hampton entered the kitchen, I could see there was something different in the way she held herself. Her face seemed tight, her smile a thin line. “Good morning,” I ventured, trying to break the silence, and there was a coolness in her voice as she greeted me in return.

I finished my breakfast quickly, made my excuses, and returned to my room. My bed was made—and I noticed that the dolls were now fully sat up in the pram, staring blankly at me. I realized with horror that I'd forgotten to remove the cushion before I came down for breakfast. I felt embarrassment bloom inside of me as I sat uncomfortably with the idea that I'd offended my hosts.

That night, the fever struck hard. My head screamed with pressure, my vision dancing and blurring. The air inside my room seemed unbearably thick with pot-pourri and scented candles. Desperate for fresh air, I stumbled outside, my legs feeling spindly and delicate as I stepped onto the damp lawn. The night was completely still and the grounds lay in wait, my rasping breaths the only sound.

II didn’t see the gnome until it was too late. My foot collided with it, sending it toppling over, and the thick crack of shattering plaster echoed through the quiet garden.

As I crouched down to inspect the damage, I saw something shining among the shards. I picked it up—a gold ring, tarnished with age. I stared at it dumbly, not quite sure what I was seeing. Had this come from inside the gnome? Or had it just been on the floor when I kicked the gnome over? The whole situation seemed unreal in the haze of my sickness, but I wasn't about to leave the mess for the Hamptons to discover with distaste in the morning. I picked up the plaster pieces carefully, and as I lifted up the gnome's shattered base, I noticed initials engraved into the bottom: E.R.

A thought came over me. Kneeling on the grass, I inspected the other gnomes nearby. Sure enough, every single one had initials painted on or carved into the base—C.W., M.G., L.H. Did each of these gnomes have a name? I struggled to process what I was seeing or what it meant. I staggered back to my room, not looking forward to telling the Hamptons about my accident, my mind swirling with confusion.

The next day, despite my sickness, a determination took hold of me. I was nearly a week into my stay, and still I had not explored the woods at the back of the property that had seemed so beckoning and lovely when I had booked. Maybe they would hold more secrets? Even though the sun hadn't quite risen yet I forced myself out of bed, slipped on my shoes, and ventured towards the forest.

Gnomes were lined up, as if trying to block my way, as I approached the ramshackle gate at the neck of the woods. I stepped over them as I unlatched it and walked through.

The forest was deliciously untouched and natural, with brambles cascading over undergrowth and the ground carpeted in pine needles and leaf litter. It smelt like green wildness, thick with fertile damp. It felt like a welcome relief from Briar House, where everything was meticulously manicured and arranged.

The woods got closer and wilder as I walked further in. In the distance I spied a small outbuilding, half-obscured by a tight tangle of trees. I stepped over logs and ducked under branches as I wound a path towards it.

The building was ramshackle, smelling like wet wood and covered in mildew. For a moment I almost turned away until I noticed the thin wooden crucifixes dangling from the eaves, moving slowly in the breeze. I could feel my heart pumping quicker as I pushed open the door, the creak of its hinges filling the silence.

Inside, the dim light revealed shelves cluttered with strange trinkets—broken watches, torn scraps of clothing, even lockets and rings scattered among bits of bone and old, dried flowers. In the center of it all, my mother’s locket lay tangled in a patch of freshly-disturbed dust, shining faintly in the sickly light.

Fear sank my stomach like a stone as my eyes fell on the gnome sat next to it. With wavering hands I lifted it, turning it over to find J.M.—my initials—scratched into the base.

A wave of sickness washed over me. Maybe I wasn’t a visitor at Briar House—maybe I was an offering to it.

I grabbed the locket and stumbled back towards the house, trying to still my heart and make myself look as inconspicuous as possible. I didn't know what this all meant, but I knew that something was very wrong, and I needed to get out of here before something awful happened. I slipped inside and snuck up to my room.

As I stuffed my clothes into my bags, something caught my eye. A guestbook lay on a squat, mahogany table in the corner of the room. Flipping through its pages, I scanned each entry, noting the names and comparing them in my mind with the initials I’d seen on the gnomes. I remembered seeing a C.W., an M.G., an E.R., and it didn't take me long to find a match for C.W—Clara Wainwright.

I grabbed the guestbook and flipped open my laptop. I likely wouldn't be able to find any information about these people based on their names alone, but Clara's entry also had a location: "Briar House is a beautiful, restful place. Coming all the way from busy Portland, I’ve never felt so peaceful as I did here. The Hamptons are warm and thoughtful hosts, and the garden is like a fairy tale. I’ll carry the memory of this place with me forever, and I hope to return someday. Sincerely, Clara Wainwright."

I tapped "Clara Wainwright Portland Oregon" into Google. Shudders ran down my spine as I read:

"Portland, Oregon—Clara Wainwright, 34, a lifelong resident of Portland, passed away on September 5th after a brief but serious illness. Known for her vibrant personality and love of travel, Clara was a graphic designer and avid gardener who was deeply loved by her friends and family.

Clara fell ill shortly after returning from a solo retreat in rural British Columbia. Despite receiving care at a Portland hospital, her health declined rapidly, and she slipped into a coma in late August, passing away soon after. Doctors were unable to determine the exact nature of her illness . . ."

Before I could read any further, I heard footsteps behind me. I spun around to see Mr and Mrs Hampton standing in the doorway. Their faces tightened as they saw the open guestbook and the obituary article on my screen—their mouths curled as if snarling, anger darkening their features.

“What are you doing, Jade?” Mrs Hampton asked, her voice icy and sharp.

I didn’t answer, but I couldn't just sit here. I didn't really know what my game plan was as I leapt off the bed, grabbed one of the dolls from the pram, and hurled it to the floor. Almost in slow motion I watched the doll's china head shatter, pieces scattering across the wood.

Among the shards, something plastic lay there—a baby's dummy, yellowed with age.

The Hamptons faces lit up with rage. As Mr Hampton lurched towards me, I ducked. I slipped past Mrs Hampton, adrenaline coursing through me as I bolted down the stairs. She cried out with shock and surprise, and Mr Hampton roared like an angry beast as they gave chase. I didn't look back—didn't wait to see how close they were as I fumbled with the keys, finally turning the ignition and tearing down the gravel path, the Hamptons’ figures growing smaller in my rear view mirror.

I'm writing out this story now to try to exorcise it from my brain. I can't stop thinking about the memory of those gnomes, their rosy faces hiding awful secrets. I haven't finished the book I've been trying to write—that story feels so thin and insignificant now.

Despite my better judgment, I looked up Briar House online one more time. The listing was the same as before: charming, pristine photos of the Victorian house, the gardens brimming with gnomes and fairy houses. I scrolled down to the reviews, glancing through the familiar praises for the “quaint” decorations and “quiet, friendly hosts.” But one recent review caught my eye.

“The little gnomes are adorable,” it read, alongside a photo of the garden I knew too well. “My favorite part? I found one tucked under a bush with my initials carved into the base! Such a funny coincidence—I felt like I truly belonged.”

A week has passed since I left Briar House, but I don't feel like I escaped. I'm still so sick, and every time I muster up the energy to leave my house, I see gnomes everywhere now—in shop windows, tucked under bushes in the park. Each one has that same unnerving grin, as if it knows me, as if it's amused at my fear.

This morning I found a wooden crucifix on my nightstand. Briar House is following me, an unwelcome stranger reaching into my life. I'm terrified that it won't let me go until it's claimed me.
