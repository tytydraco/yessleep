hi, my name's mason, also known as "getthatbag," and if im being honest i dont know what im doing here. everyone on this website is detailing horrible experiences, and sometimes people get advice on what to do, so ig that's why im here.

im a high school student, hayden (THE\_VALEDICTORIAN) and camila (ROADRAGE2), are my best friends. yesterday all of this shit happened, as you can see above from our group chat. the day before yesterday we were fucking around with an ouija board, just for fun, we were just joking around. we didn't say goodbye, or whatever though, at the end.

the same night all of this happened, i went with my parents over to the street camila and hayden live on, my parents know them both really well. when we got there, camila's front door was open, and the sconce's light bulb was broken. a piece of a "planchette" (the thing u use to spawn the shit with the ouija board) was on her front door matt. apprently both camila's parents, and hayden's were away, leaving them both home alone.

when we went across the street, to hayden's house, the front door was locked, but i know he keeps a key under the mat so i unlocked it and went in. when we went to the basement door, it was shut. when we opened it, there were scratch marks on the inside of the door. upon going down the stairs, the stuff we had left two nights ago was still there, aswell as the ouija board, on the floor. on the way back up the stairs, upon finding nothing, there was another piece of the planchette on the final stair going back up to the ground floor.

nobody knows where camila and hayden went, and no cameras caught anything. i'm scared, and i don't know where my friends went, and i want them back, and i want everything back to normal. im panicking, i cant think straight, im really freaking out. sorry if my grammar and spelling is off, im just really panicking. i'm really hoping i can get advice here, so i uploaded the entirety of the chat we had here.

a few hours ago, the "BrooklynAdler" account sent me a freind request.

i guess the question i need answered is

do i accept it?
