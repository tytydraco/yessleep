My life is really simple. I spend my day like most people my age do, going to school or hanging out with friends, you name it. I lived an average life, really, if I told you all about how my day goes, you'd get bored really quickly. When it came to paranormal experiences, I did not believe in them, and fortunately, never went through one.


Until now.

It was a rainy night, I prepared a hot cup of milk and went to my room. I turned on the TV, mindlessly scrolling through random shows, and I realized that I really never found anything entertaining. My life, was truly boring and devoid of any enjoyment. Sometimes I wondered if I am becoming an emotionless, bland human being. Anyways, I brushed these thoughts off as I sipped on my hot milk and watched the TV. It was going decently until the lightning started. It startled me when I saw the lightning strike, as I looked at my balcony, another ray of lightning struck. What I saw shook me to the core.




A silhouette. 





A silhouette of a man and a woman, sitting on the edge of my balcony. They were sitting next to each other and holding hands. At this time, I don't know what was happening to me, but I didn't even think. Not about how they got in there, or who they are, adrenaline was pumping through my body, as I stared at the silhouette of the couple. I tried to comfort myself, but I ended up failing. Miserably. I suddenly knew I had to do something about it, I couldn't just sit here. I pushed to the balcony, my hands shaking that I could barely manage to open it. I walked up to the couple... Nothing. It was like they were devoid of any form of life, it was like there was no souls in their bodies. I stared at them as they didn't move, didn't do anything, they were as still as statues, their faces, which I couldn't make out, were staring right at me. 

"Who are you..." I managed to muster, as I stood there shaking. "I-I said who are you!"

My attempts at intimidation failed, as my voice started shaking, fear etched on my face. It appeared, in fact, that I was the one who is being intimidated.

Lightning struck.


Their faces appeared.


What I saw that day, got eternally carved in my mind. I could never forget the pain, suffering and despair I saw on those... "Faces"

It was the man I noticed. I looked at his blue colored eyes with fear that I never felt before.




He had no eyelids. His skin, as pale as a corpse. Not only that, he had no lips. His pale skin was full of cuts and scars. I was scared shitless, my body was shaking in a way that I thought I was going to explode the very next second. Once again, I tried to use my mind and rationalize everythingthing that was happening, but I ultimately failed. My brain wasn't functioning. It was like the only thing occupying my mind is the silhouette of the two figures sitting on the edge of my balcony. I knew I wouldn't recover from what I saw on their faces. Not only the horrible torture, but the horrifying expressions. I eventually made the decision that, alive or not, these people, or even if they weren't peoplee, deserve to rest easy. The suffering and despair etched on their faces, the pain that was apparent on their expression. When I saw their faces, I felt like they were begging for freedom, so I decided that I would be the one giving them the rest they deserved.




I pushed them off. I sprinted at the man, with no resistance from him, I threw my weight at him, pushing him off, as he fell. I quickly turned to the woman, whom I summoned my strength to shove off the edge. I quickly backed off, realizing how much adrenaline was pumping in my body, my hands were shaking, I was losing control. I was surprised that as they landed on the ground, there was no thud or any sound following these events. What happened next truly horrified me.




I heard the voice of a woman, as a man started to join in from downwards. They took little to no break as they started following each other up with these sentences, desperation and pain apparent in their voices. They were the voices of a broken couple, a couple that suffered torture beyond what most humans can comprehend.





"Thank you"

"You did good"

"You're good"

"You did good"

"Thank you."


A surge of adrenaline flowed through my body as a humongous quantity of fear started settling in. The fear I felt that day was unlike anything I have felt before. Deep down, I knew that I would never be the same after witnessing this gruesome experience that I was going through. 

He had no lips.


Nor did she. 


So how were they speaking?


Their voices. They were full of pain. They were the voices of those who suffered too much. Their voices made me feel like they were people who suffered eternal torture at the hands of a devil. It's like they were tortured souls, trapped eternally, the desperation in their voices made me feel like I was their savior, the one destined to free them from their curse, as well as give them the freedom that they yearned for, for years. I looked down and didn't find their cotpse. I quickly closed the door of the balcony after I went back in my room. I sat in my bed in silence, as tears started to flow through my face. I had a thousand questions, and that the encounter finally ended, they started to pop up in my mind. I didn't sleep that night. I had to go to school the very next day, I couldn't focus on anything. I was clearly shaken from the experience that I went through, I was eager to go back home. When I went back home after finishing school, I found my parents staring at the TV, as the news was on.


 "22-year-old David Smith and  20-year-old Amanda Walker, his wife, were found by the police tonight. An explorer reported smelling what seemed like a corpse as he was exploring in the forest,  when he found what looked like a house. The design of the house was odd, reported witnesses. The police found that the supposedly place of residence was a torture chamber from the inside, with a balcony built in the second floor to keep victims in the cold. Officers found the corpse of the two victim, naked and tied up, thrown in the balcony. They suffered horrible torture for years. This includes surgical removal of eyelids, lips, and multiple gruesome surgeries and acts of torture. They were tied up in the balcony, with the inability to speak or close their eyes. All they could do is stare at each other's deformed and tortured faces, until they succumbed from extreme pain and starvation. This information was reported from their killer, who was caught tonight as police raided his hidden place of operation. The couple were found and had a funeral held for them, their corpses were buried and they finally rest easy."



I felt horror from what I heard, as I started sobbing uncontrollably. I knew no one would believe my story, but I also realized telling my parents was important. As they came to comfort me, I told them the whole story and I was relieved when they eventually told me that they believed my story and that they knew that I was telling the truth. I eventually ended up visiting the young couples' grave, paying my respects. As I turned around and started to walk away, I heard their voices, the pain was now gone from them, they were the voices of an overjoyed couple, resting easy after all what they went through.


"Thank you" said a man, followed up by a woman

"You did good"

"Thank you"

"You did good"
