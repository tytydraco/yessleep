My boots crunched over damp leaves as I followed the winding trail deeper into the woods. The air smelled of moss and earth, thick with the scent of rain that had passed through earlier in the day. I was supposed to stick to the main path, but curiosity had gotten the better of me.

The forest was quiet. Too quiet.

I had hiked these woods before, but I had never seen this clearing.

The trees parted around it, their skeletal branches curling inward like fingers. The grass was overgrown, patches of wildflowers dotting the landscape. But none of that mattered—because in the very center of the clearing stood a window.

Just a frame. No glass.

It was tall and weathered, the paint long stripped away by time. It looked like it had been ripped from an old house and placed here, upright, with no walls to support it.

My stomach twisted. Something about it felt… wrong.

I stepped closer.

From this side, I saw only the forest beyond. Trees stretched toward the sky, the same as before. But when I moved—just slightly—so that I was directly in front of it…

I stopped breathing.

Through the empty frame, I saw my bedroom.

Not just a bedroom that looked like mine. My bedroom.

The familiar bookshelf stood against the far wall, overflowing with half-read novels and trinkets. My desk, cluttered with notes and empty coffee cups, sat beside it. The curtains were drawn, the dim glow of my bedside lamp casting long shadows over the walls.

And there, lying in bed, was me.

I stumbled back, my heartbeat slamming against my ribs. My mind scrambled for a rational explanation, but nothing made sense. I wasn’t dreaming—I could feel the cool air on my skin, the dampness from the earlier rain still clinging to my jacket.

I took another step forward, peering through the frame again. The scene hadn’t changed.

The figure—I—was still there, curled under the covers. My chest rose and fell with steady breaths, my head turned slightly toward the window. But then, as I watched…

I opened my eyes.

Not the me standing here.

The me in the bed.

I stared at myself, and myself stared back.

The figure in the bed didn’t move. Just lay there, eyes wide, locked onto mine through the window in the forest.

A chill ran down my spine.

I raised a shaking hand.

The me in the window raised one, too.

I turned my head slightly.

So did they.

I was about to step back—to run—when something changed.

The figure’s lips parted. A slow, stretching smile spread across its face. Too wide.

Then, ever so slightly, it shook its head.

I gasped and stumbled backward. My foot caught on a root, and I hit the ground hard, my hands scraping against damp earth. The moment I was out of view, the connection broke. I couldn’t see the bedroom anymore—just trees, rustling slightly in the wind.

My breath came in ragged bursts.

I pushed myself up and bolted, not stopping to look back.

But as I ran, a new, horrifying thought crept in:

What if, when I got home, I wasn’t the one waiting there?

I ran.

Branches whipped at my arms as I pushed through the undergrowth, feet slipping on the damp earth. My heartbeat pounded in my ears, my breath ragged. The forest felt darker now, the trees pressing in, shadows stretching longer than they should.

I kept expecting to hear footsteps behind me, but the woods were silent. Too silent. No wind. No birds. Just my own panicked breathing.

I didn’t stop until I reached my car.

It sat where I had left it, parked at the end of the trail, half-hidden by the overgrown brush. My hands shook as I yanked open the door and threw myself inside, slamming it shut behind me.

For a moment, I just sat there, gripping the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white. My mind raced, trying to make sense of what I had seen.

It wasn’t possible.

It had to be some kind of trick.

Maybe I had inhaled something weird in the woods. Maybe there was some logical explanation—an optical illusion, a hallucination, anything other than what my gut was telling me.

That I had just seen myself.

And that it—whatever it was—had seen me too.

I forced a deep breath and turned the key. The engine rumbled to life, breaking the awful silence. My headlights flicked on, illuminating the trees ahead, casting long, skeletal shadows across the dirt path.

I didn’t look back.

The drive home was a blur.

I kept checking my rearview mirror, expecting to see something on the road behind me. A shape in the distance. A figure standing in the middle of the street.

But there was nothing. Just the empty highway stretching out behind me, the headlights cutting through the darkness.

By the time I pulled into my driveway, my nerves were raw.

My house looked the same as always—porch light glowing softly, curtains drawn over the windows. Familiar. Safe.

But the moment I stepped out of the car, I hesitated.

What if I was already inside?

The thought sent a shudder through me. It was irrational. Impossible. I had just imagined it.

Right?

I swallowed hard and walked up to the front door. My hands were clammy as I unlocked it and pushed it open.

The house was quiet.

I stepped inside, locking the door behind me. My ears strained for any sound, any sign that someone—or something—was here. But all I could hear was the soft hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen, the distant ticking of the clock in the hallway.

I let out a slow breath.

Everything was fine.

Still, my skin prickled as I made my way down the hall. My bedroom door was closed. It hadn’t been when I left.

I stood there, staring at it. My pulse pounded in my throat.

What if I opened that door and saw myself lying in bed?

I reached for the handle.

Turned it.

Pushed the door open.

The room was empty.

The bed was neatly made, the curtains drawn, the dim glow of the bedside lamp casting soft shadows over the walls. Exactly how I had left it.

My breath shuddered out of me. I felt stupid now, standing there in my own bedroom, shaken over nothing.

I was exhausted. My mind was playing tricks on me.

I closed the door behind me and sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing my face with my hands. The image of that thing in the window was burned into my brain. That smile. The way it had shaken its head, like it knew something I didn’t.

I needed to sleep.

I crawled under the covers and reached for my phone on the nightstand. The screen lit up.

And then, every nerve in my body went cold.

Because there was a notification.

A photo.

A new AirDrop request from an unknown sender.

My breath hitched. My thumb trembled as I opened it.

And there, staring back at me, was a photo of my bedroom. Taken from the doorway.

I whipped my head toward the door.

It was still closed.

But I wasn’t alone.

I couldn’t move.

My fingers clenched around my phone, my breath coming in short, shallow bursts. The photo on the screen—it wasn’t possible. I had just walked into my room. The door had been closed. Locked.

But someone—or something—had been standing right there, taking a picture.

I forced myself to look up, my eyes locked on the bedroom door. It was still closed. The brass handle gleamed in the dim light, perfectly still.

No one was there.

At least, no one I could see.

I swallowed hard, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. My mind raced through explanations. A prank? But who? The woods were miles away from anything, and I had been alone all day.

A hacker? But how would they have taken that picture?

My hands shook as I tapped the screen, heart hammering as I checked the AirDrop sender.

Unknown.

Of course.

I tapped the photo, zooming in, searching for anything—a shadow, a reflection, something that would give me a clue. But it was just my room. Empty. Like the photo had been taken a second before I entered.

A cold sweat prickled down my spine.

I needed to check the house.

I slid out of bed slowly, my bare feet touching the floor without a sound. Every nerve in my body screamed at me to stay put, to pretend I never saw the photo.

But I couldn’t ignore it.

I crept to the door and pressed my ear against it. Silence. Not even the hum of the refrigerator now. Just a thick, unnatural stillness.

I turned the knob.

The door creaked open.

The hallway was empty, bathed in soft shadows from the nightlight in the wall. My living room was just beyond, the kitchen tucked to the right. The air felt wrong, like the house was holding its breath.

I stepped out.

Every instinct told me something was here, something unseen, watching.

The floor was cool under my feet as I padded down the hall, scanning every dark corner, every doorway. The front door was locked. The windows were shut. Nothing seemed out of place.

But then I noticed something.

The curtain in the living room.

When I had left earlier that day, it had been open, letting in the soft afternoon light. Now it was drawn.

I stared at it, dread pooling in my stomach.

I took a step forward.

Another.

I reached out, hesitating just before touching the fabric. A single breath of cold air brushed against my hand.

Then—the curtain twitched.

I stumbled back, heart slamming against my ribs.

For a moment, nothing happened. The curtain hung still. Just fabric. Just my imagination.

Then, slowly, the fabric parted.

And behind it—

There was nothing.

Not a wall. Not a window. Just a pitch-black void.

I choked on a breath, my legs locked in place.

That wasn’t my window.

It wasn’t anything.

Just an endless, empty dark.

Then, from that darkness, something moved.

I didn’t wait to see what it was.

I ran.

I tore down the hall, feet barely touching the floor, throwing myself into my bedroom and slamming the door behind me.

My hands fumbled for the lock. Click.

I backed away, panting. My phone was still clutched in my hand, the screen glowing in the dim light. The photo was still open.

But now, there was a second picture.

My stomach turned to ice.

I didn’t AirDrop this.

I didn’t take this.

But there it was. A new photo, taken from the same doorway.

Except now, I was in the bed.

And standing over me—

Was a shadow.

Not a person. Not a shape I could define. Just wrongness. A smudge of black, featureless, leaning over my sleeping body.

The air in my lungs turned to stone.

My gaze darted to the bed.

It was empty. Untouched.

I looked back at the photo.

And this time—

The shadow’s head had turned.

It was looking at me.

I couldn’t breathe.

I wanted to scream, to move, to do something, but all I could do was stare at the photo.

At it.

That shadowy figure, that formless, wrong thing was no longer just standing over my sleeping body. It was facing me.

My fingers felt numb as I lowered the phone, forcing myself to look at my room.

The bed was still empty. The doorway was clear.

There was nothing there.

But that didn’t mean I was alone.

I swallowed hard, my throat dry, my ears straining for any sound. The house was silent. Not the normal, peaceful quiet of the night.

This silence felt heavy. Suffocating. Like something was waiting.

I needed to get out.

I turned, grabbing my bag from the chair. My car keys were inside. I just needed to make it to the front door, get in the car, and drive. Anywhere.

I reached for the doorknob.

The second my fingers touched it—

A sound.

Soft.

A creak.

Like weight shifting on the floor behind me.

I froze.

The bed was empty. I had checked. I knew it was empty.

But something was there now.

I turned my head just enough to glance at my phone’s screen.

The photo had changed again.

The shadow wasn’t over my bed anymore.

It was standing right behind me.

I spun around—

Nothing.

But my mirror—

The mirror on the far wall, the one across from my bed—

It wasn’t empty.

I was there. Standing. Staring.

But I wasn’t alone.

A shape loomed behind me.

Not quite touching.

Not quite human.

Just a mass of blackness, shifting, twisting, watching.

I barely had time to think before the lights flickered.

Then went out.

The darkness swallowed me whole.

I gasped, my heart hammering so hard I could feel it in my throat. My phone—the only light left—flickered too, the screen distorting, static warping the image.

I could still see my reflection.

And the thing behind me.

It was closer now.

So close that if it had a mouth, it could whisper in my ear.

I couldn’t breathe.

I squeezed my eyes shut, my fingers curling so tightly around my phone it hurt.

This isn’t real.

It couldn’t be.

I had to move.

I forced myself to take a step back, reaching for the wall, for the door, for anything solid.

My fingers found the handle.

I turned it.

The door wouldn’t open.

Something pressed against my back.

Not a hand. Not a body. Just pressure. Like the air itself had thickened, molding around me, holding me in place.

My reflection twitched.

My reflection smiled.

My reflection wasn’t me anymore.

The lights flickered back on.

And I was alone.

The pressure was gone. The room was silent again.

My legs nearly gave out as I stumbled away from the mirror, shoving my phone into my pocket, trying to catch my breath.

I had to go.

I didn’t care if the door was locked. I would break a window, run barefoot into the woods if I had to.

But when I turned back to the door—

It was open.

Just a crack.

And from the dark hallway beyond, something laughed.

A dry, rasping, inhuman sound.

I didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Didn’t breathe.

Then—

The door creaked open.

And I saw it.

Not a shadow this time. Not a reflection.

Something real.

Something that had been waiting.

And it was smiling at me.

I ran.

I didn’t think. Didn’t look back.

I ran.

The hallway stretched ahead of me, warped by shadows that flickered in the dim light. The walls felt too close, the air too thick. The thing behind me—whatever it was—was still there. Watching. Waiting.

But it wasn’t stopping me.

That was worse.

I didn’t care where I was going, just that I had to get out. Out of the house. Out of the town. Away from whatever had stepped through that window in the woods.

My hand slammed against the front door.

Unlocked.

I didn’t hesitate.

The night air hit me like a shock of cold water, but I didn’t stop. My car was pointless—keys still in my bag, bag still upstairs, and I wasn’t about to go back.

The only place left to go was the one place I never should have been in the first place.

The woods.

I sprinted across the yard, my lungs burning, my legs screaming. I didn’t care. The trees loomed ahead, dark and endless, swallowing the last bits of moonlight. My chest tightened at the thought of stepping back into them.

But I had no choice.

Because something was behind me.

I heard it. A slow, dragging step. Not running. Not chasing.

Because it didn’t have to.

I hit the treeline at full speed, branches clawing at my arms, twigs snapping beneath my feet. The deeper I went, the quieter the world became.

Like it was holding its breath.

I didn’t know where I was going. My phone was still in my pocket, but I wasn’t about to slow down and check the time. Or the messages. Or the camera.

Not after what I had seen.

The clearing.

That was the only answer.

I had to find it again.

I pushed forward, lungs burning, feet aching, my mind screaming at me to turn back—but there was nothing to turn back to.

The laughter followed me.

That dry, rasping sound. Closer now.

I bit down on a whimper, refusing to look back. I wasn’t fast enough. It was always right there.

A root caught my foot.

I hit the ground hard.

Pain shot up my arms, my palms scraping against rock and dirt. I gasped, trying to push myself up—

And then I saw it.

Ahead, in the distance.

The window.

Still standing in the clearing. Still wrong.

Still showing something I knew wasn’t real.

I scrambled to my feet, ignoring the way my body ached, the way my breath came in sharp, uneven gasps.

I had come back here for a reason.

I didn’t know what it was.

But something did.

The laughter stopped.

And I knew, without looking—

It was standing right behind me.

I didn’t want to turn around.

I knew it was there. I felt it. Close enough that if I moved too slowly, if I hesitated for even a second, it could reach out and—

No.

I couldn’t think about that.

The window was in front of me. Still standing in the clearing. Still impossible.

The scene inside hadn’t changed.

My bedroom. Exactly as I had left it.

Except for one thing.

The figure in my bed was sitting up now.

I could see its head tilt toward me. A shadowy blur, just out of focus.

I didn’t have time to think.

I ran straight for it.

My body slammed into the frame, and for a brief, impossible second, I thought I’d just crash through it. Fall forward into nothing. But instead—

The world snapped.

A cold rush of air sucked the breath from my lungs, like I was being pulled through a vacuum. My ears popped, and everything went silent. My vision fractured, like looking through broken glass—flashes of movement, color, but nothing that made sense.

Then—

I hit the floor.

Hard.

My limbs tangled beneath me, and I gasped as the air punched from my chest. The world spun. My head throbbed. The silence stretched out, thick and unnatural, pressing in from every direction.

I forced myself to sit up, blinking against the disorientation.

And then I saw it.

I was home.

Or—

It looked like home.

I was sitting on my bedroom floor, facing the bed. The sheets were rumpled, just like they had been when I left. My phone was still on the nightstand, its screen dark. The window in the wall showed the same quiet neighborhood street.

For a second, I almost believed it.

Then my eyes landed on the door.

It was wrong.

Slightly too tall. The edges too sharp.

And the shadows beneath it—

They moved.

A slow, pulsing shift, as if something on the other side was breathing.

I pushed myself to my feet. My hands were shaking. I didn’t know what I had expected, but I knew this wasn’t right.

I turned back to the window, hoping—praying—that I could step through it again.

But it was gone.

Just a blank wall.

Like it had never been there at all.

A soft creak behind me.

I spun around, heart slamming against my ribs.

The door had opened.

Not all the way. Just enough to show the darkened hallway beyond.

And in that hallway, something stood waiting.

Not moving. Not breathing.

Just watching.

I swallowed hard. My throat was dry, my pulse hammering in my ears.

I wasn’t in my house.

Not anymore.

And whatever was in here with me—

It knew.

I didn’t move.

Neither did it.

The figure in the hallway was just standing there, its shape obscured by shadows. Too tall. Too still.

Then—

It tilted its head.

A slow, deliberate motion. Not human. Not natural. Like it was trying to understand me.

Something deep inside me screamed to run. But I didn’t.

Because behind me, from the wall where the window should have been, a voice whispered—

“Don’t.”

I stiffened. My breath caught in my throat.

It was my voice.

I turned my head slightly, just enough to see the mirror hanging on the far wall.

Except—

It wasn’t just a reflection.

I was standing in it.

My reflection was looking at me—but its lips were moving on their own.

“Don’t run. It wants you to.”

The thing in the hallway took a step forward.

I flinched. My reflection didn’t.

“It plays by rules.” The whisper came again. “Play back.”

Rules.

I swallowed hard, my mind racing.

Everything here was wrong, but it had structure. The window had worked like a portal. The door had opened when I acknowledged it. And this… thing… was waiting for me to react.

Like a game.

I looked at my reflection, meeting my own eyes. “What do I do?” I mouthed.

The other me smiled.

Not a reassuring smile. Not comforting.

It was a grin full of knowing.

“Use the board.”

I frowned. The board?

I glanced back at the room. My room. Everything was identical to how I’d left it. My bed, my phone, my desk—

Then I saw it.

My chessboard.

It was set up on my desk, mid-game. The last match I’d played against myself. White’s move.

I didn’t have time to question it.

I walked toward it slowly, forcing my breathing to stay even. Behind me, I could hear the thing in the hallway shifting, its movements slow, patient.

Waiting.

I reached the desk and studied the board. My last move had left my queen exposed. If I was playing against myself, I’d take it with a knight.

I lifted the black knight and moved it.

As soon as I let go, the door slammed shut.

A gust of air rattled through the room, making the walls tremble.

I turned back toward the mirror. My reflection was nodding.

“Good.”

The ground beneath me shuddered. The walls stretched, as if the entire room was breathing. The air grew thick, heavy, pressing in on me.

Another piece had moved on the board. Not by me.

Black pawn, two spaces forward.

My turn again.

A sick realization settled in my stomach.

I wasn’t playing alone.

I turned toward the door.

The thing in the hallway—whatever it was—was still there. Except now… it was smiling too.

I exhaled slowly and faced the board again.

If this was a game—

I had to win.

I didn’t look up from the board. I didn’t dare.

Whatever was in the hallway wanted me to react, and I wasn’t going to give it the satisfaction.

I studied the pieces, my hands clammy as I reached for my next move.

Pawn to e4.

I let go.

The second I did, the entire room lurched sideways, like the floor itself had tipped.

I staggered, barely keeping my balance as my stomach twisted from the shift. My desk dragged itself a few inches closer to the mirror. The air pulsed like a heartbeat, thick and suffocating.

Behind me, I could hear the thing move. Its footsteps didn’t match the floor. Like it wasn’t walking on wood, but something else entirely. Something wet. Something alive.

I clenched my jaw and looked at the board.

The next move had already been made.

A knight, creeping closer to my king.

I swallowed.

It was testing me.

I slid my fingers over a bishop, considering my options. If I took the knight, I’d expose my queen. If I moved my queen, I’d leave my king vulnerable.

Every move had a consequence.

I glanced at the mirror. My reflection was still watching, but its expression had changed.

No more grin. No amusement.

It looked worried.

That made two of us.

I shifted my bishop forward, threatening the knight. As soon as I let go, the room shuddered again.

The door to the hallway slowly creaked back open.

And the thing in the shadows stepped inside.

I gripped the edge of my desk so hard my knuckles turned white.

It was closer now. I still couldn’t see its face—if it even had one—but its shape was wrong. Its limbs were too long, its spine curved unnaturally. And worst of all, I could hear it breathing.

Deep, wet gasps. Like it was trying to taste the air.

I forced my eyes back to the board.

The game wasn’t over. I could still win.

The pieces rattled. Another had moved—on its own.

The knight was now right next to my king.

I was running out of time.

My reflection in the mirror shook its head.

Wrong move.

A chill crawled up my spine.

I turned back to the board, my heartbeat pounding in my ears.

I had to think. Had to be smart.

If this was a game, there was always a way out.

I looked at my pieces. Then I looked at my opponent’s.

And finally, I realized—

I wasn’t playing to win.

I was playing to survive.

The rules had been clear from the start. Every move I made changed the room. Changed what was coming for me.

But if I didn’t move—if I refused to play—

What happened then?

The thing in the room took another step closer.

I clenched my fists.

Then, for the first time since the game started—

I did nothing.

And the room went silent.

The silence pressed in on me, thick and absolute.

I didn’t move.

The thing in the room didn’t either.

The only sound was my own heartbeat, hammering inside my chest like it was trying to escape.

I kept my hands in my lap, fingers curled so tight they ached. My eyes flicked to the board.

No new moves.

The pieces remained frozen where they were. The knight still loomed over my king. A checkmate waiting to happen.

But it hadn’t happened yet.

The thing in the room shifted. I could hear it, the slow creak of weight pressing into the floor. The wet, dragging breaths—just behind me now. Close enough that I could feel the air change. Feel the cold creeping over my skin.

I kept my eyes down.

If I reacted, I’d lose.

My reflection in the mirror still watched, but something had changed. It wasn’t mirroring me anymore. It was moving on its own.

It raised its hand and tapped a finger against its temple.

Think.

I swallowed.

Then, slowly, I leaned forward and stared at the board.

There had to be something I was missing.

The game was still going. The thing in the room was still waiting.

Waiting for me to make the next move.

I studied the pieces. My opponent’s side.

And then—I saw it.

The one piece I hadn’t been paying attention to.

The king.

Not my king.

Theirs.

I inhaled sharply.

This wasn’t about survival. It never had been.

It was about winning.

And there was only one way to do that.

I reached out, slow and steady.

The thing in the room lurched forward.

I ignored it.

My fingers closed around my queen. I moved her.

The second I let go—

Checkmate.

The room convulsed.

A sound ripped through the air—something high-pitched and wrong, like metal scraping against bone. The walls blurred, folding in on themselves like paper. My desk split in half, the mirror cracked—

And the thing in the room—

It screamed.

Not a sound of pain.

A sound of rage.

I squeezed my eyes shut, gripping the edge of the table as the world collapsed around me.

And then—

Silence.

A different kind this time. Not heavy, not pressing.

Just... empty.

I opened my eyes.

The board was gone.

The room was normal again.

And I was alone.

At least, that’s what I thought.

Until I saw the mirror.

The reflection inside it?

It was still playing the game.

And this time—

It wasn’t me sitting in the chair.
