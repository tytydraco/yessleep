At the shop this morning we had the regular faces. I was early for once. That's because we were working on my first job I had been assigned as a foreman. 

Laz Healthcare was the hardest job I have encountered so far. It's not like I haven't had good help either. Turd was banned from the site the first hour he was there. Something about “wandering into the lab or some shit”. They said he was muttering and trying to break down the door. I had Lou pick him up immediately. Ever since I've had Zeke and Izzy. They're smart guys, but they're green. The whole job is to install some new bathrooms and the some acid piping for the new lab. 

Bill told me the job should take 5 weeks. After looking at the plans, I figured I could get it done in 3. Oh how I was wrong. It was Friday on the third week and we weren't even close to making the 5 week deadline. I have a tailgate meeting every morning to discuss site safety and what jobs the boys and I will be doing today. 

“Zeke, Izzy, come here. We’re making a game plan for today.” 

“Lemme guess, drill more holes?” said Zeke

“Yea,” I responded exhaustedly. 

“Tefucinhelaralltheezgonefer,” said Izzy 

“The holes are for the piping Izzy. I'm trying to run it as fast as you’re drilling them. How many are we at Zeke?” 

“313”

“How many do you have left abouts?” 

“Teneac,” said Izzy 

“Figure we can get those 20 done today?” 

“We’d be pushing hard at that rate. It is about an hour a hole in some places.”

“Do the best you can.” 

“Ferckinryin” 

“I know Izzy, I was hoping to have the job completed this week.” 

After that brief tailgate meeting, the boys had their jobs and I had mine. The day proceeded as normal. I went to where I was working and set my radio up. I go a bit crazy if I don't have something playing in the background on my jobsites. Today I was listening to these two guys yap away about scary stories they've read. I like these two. One is some kid from Appalachia, you know what they say about people from Appalachia, and the other is some old dude who's got a kickass neckbeard according to the kid. They spend hours yammering on about spooky shit. However, the noise they make helps me concentrate. 

I continued working and at lunch break I asked the boys to give me a progress update. 

“Zeke, how we doing?”

“Way we’re going today, we may just hit that deadline,” Zeke said enthusiastically. 

“Gotreelef, ezegerttoo,” said Izzy.

“Make’s 5, we’ll see if we're lucky by the end of the day.” 

We, in fact, we’re not lucky. Zeke did fine with his final 2 holes, Izzy however…

“FERCKINPICEOFERCKINSHIET!” 

*a sound of something heavy and expensive hitting a wall then proceeding to fall to the floor* 

“IZ! The fuck are you doing?” I shouted 

“TISFERCKINOLESFERCKINWENTIFERVFERCKINFETTICK! TEFERCK, TELESTFERCKINOLE! FERCKTISFERCKINTUPIDFERCKINJHOB!”

“Walls only supposed to be a foot thick Izzy, did you mark it where it supposed to be on the plan? You could’ve hit a structural column?”

“UMERKDTEOLE! DONNTFERCKINAYEYEFERCKINRILLEDTEFERCKINOLE!”

“Well, I’ve been wrong before Izzy, I can be wrong again. Let’s go check on the plans and have a coffee,” I said calmly.

 Izzy muttered under his breath angrily as we went to my makeshift on-site office.

“Look Izzy, there’s a column right next to where you’re drilling, guess it was just a little bigger than the plans said. I fucked up buddy, I’m sorry I tried to blame you.”

“Isnotyeristeferckinjhob, iferckinateferckinbeinher.”

“Do you hate your career? Buddy you’ve been doing this for 3 years with us. I thought you loved it?”

“Iontferckinateeingaferckinlumber, Iferckinatedisferckinjhob, isgivinmeighmars” said Izzy frustratedly.

“Yea, I hear you Izzy. It’s getting to me too. I’ve found myself waking up with a cold sweat or two about this job lately,” I said exhaustedly. 

“Isyerirstjhobyergertnerosses,” said Izzy concernedly.

“Don’t remind me, I’ve wanted to call Bill, Bob or Lou and ask what the fuck to do on a few occasions,” I laughed. 

“Disjhobiskillinus.”

Izzy’s comment hung in the air as we walked quietly to where Zeke was. He had heard the commotion Izzy had made and must’ve tidied things up while we were checking the plans. 

“Well Zeke, thanks for cleaning up. I’ve gotta check that location I marked for Izzy. Seems like I fucked up.” 

I checked the location of the hole. 

“There’s not supposed to be a support here,” I said as Zeke looked into the hole.

“This sure looks like a support.”

“Well throw the last extension on the drill and we’ll see if Lou can talk his way outta repairing it if I'm wrong.” 

Izzy did as I asked and almost immediately went through.

“Guess we are lucky today,” I said to the two. 

Zeke looked into the final hole.

“Why’s it dark? Should be through to the other side, right?”

I walked into the room we were drilling into. The lights were on, but no hole. 

“Where the hell is that going? Izzy can you push further into the hole?” 

Izzy did as I asked. 

“Asferasshellger,” said Izzy 

He was in about four feet. The specs on the supports say they're solid all the way through and three feet thick.

“Zeke grab me a length of pipe.”

“Twelve foot piece or twenty-one?” 

“Twenty-one.” 

He brought the length over and I pushed into the hole. We were able to slide the entire length in. 
Puzzled, I stepped back to assess the situation. 

“Pull the pipe out Zeke. I have a feeling we’ll have to drill a new hole.” 

Zeke pulled the pipe, but it didn’t move. Suddenly the pipe jerked Zeke towards the hole. He let go and the pipe vanished. 

“Teferck?” Said Izzy. 

Astonished at what we’d just witnessed, I spoke up. 

“We still need to go through that wall, I guess drill it lower?,” I said with a tone lacking confidence. 

So Zeke mounted the drill back up and drilled another hole. Before I could get going on what I was working on, I heard Zeke shouting for me. I walked briskly back to where he was working. He was through, but we still had the same problem. There was a hole too somewhere but not where we needed to go. Finally, I had enough and grabbed my flashlight to take a look through the holes to see if I was missing something. 

“What do you see up there boss,” said Zeke. 

“It’s a massive room about 40ft deep by 60ft wide, it looks like a laboratory,” I said. 

I thought in my head if we actually drilled through the labs walls but there’s no way I had, it was a hundred feet in the other direction and plus I’d seen the interior of that lab, it was completely different. 

I shined my light through the hole to the centre of the room. It’s light reflected of 7 massive glass tank. 

“Holy shit! It looks like a sci-fi movie. There’s tanks that look like you could float…,” I trailed off. 

It was then I noticed there were things floating in the tanks. They’re were small, barely noticeable in the liquid filling the tanks. Only 4 of the tanks were full. 3 of them contained what looked to be masses of cells, though the 4th explained why the looked that way. It was a baby. It was curled in a ball. I thought it wasn’t developed enough but I noticed it was missing a hand. 

Under all the tanks was a nameplate. It appeared the first empty three were:

L04WR

L04GR

L04EN

The last 4 were

L04GL

L04SL

L04LU

L04PR

It was the oddest scene. I couldn’t describe it to my apprentices, that’s why I told them to look. 

“Guys you have to see this,” I said. 

Both Izzy and Zeke climbed the ladder and looked into the holes. 

Neither saw what I had.
