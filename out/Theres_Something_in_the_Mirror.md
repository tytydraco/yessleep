There’s something in the mirror, and it’s definitely not me.

It started last week. I just thought I was sleep-deprived. When I was standing in front of the old, ornately-framed mirror in my bathroom, rubbing sleep from my eyes – my reflection winked.

I could have *sworn* I saw it – me? – wink. But then I blinked and stared at it – *me* – and nothing seemed strange. I looked like I hadn’t slept enough, sure; the bags under my eyes wouldn’t qualify as carry-on luggage. But nothing weird. I chalked it up to exhaustion.

But later that night, as I washed my face and glanced up to check I’d gotten all the soap off – my reflection smirked at me, just for a moment, its eyes glittering with malice.

It felt too real that time. I stumbled backwards, nearly tripping over the toilet, and stared, water still dripping from my face. But everything was normal again.

That is, until I went to sleep. The murmurings started, along with the nightmares. I dreamt of never-ending mirrors, reflecting one another in an infinite labyrinth. Reflections on all sides laughed at me; voices whispered that the mirrors were reality, the mirrors were beautiful, I should appreciate their clarity and their elegance. And these murmurings didn’t stop when I awoke.

Throughout the work day, I heard random voices whisper in my ear. Some sounded like my own. All sounded like someone was right beside me, whispering loudly that the mirror held the answer to who I was, that the mirror was perfection.

I couldn’t focus. Each time the whispers, directly in my ear, caused me to jump from my chair. I was certain someone was pranking me, or maybe that my recent stress and sleep deprivation was causing a sudden psychotic breakdown.

Eventually, I left work early. And while I dreaded going home to my mirror, I also felt compelled – desperate even – to glance into it again. I felt like I needed to see it.

So I did. I rushed home to the mirror. This time, when I stood in front of it, my reflection slowly smiled at me, its grin widening until its cheeks seemed to nearly split in two.

I wasn’t smiling.

I ran out of the bathroom, tried to pack my things – thinking I’d go somewhere, *anywhere,* where that mirror wasn’t – but it seemed to have a magnetic pull on me. The voices whispered to return to the mirror, to look at its secrets, to let it show me its hidden world and envelop me completely. They got louder, more urgent, as I frantically packed. And as I reached the door, one of them – it sounded like my own voice – *screamed.*

I fell to the ground, covering my ears in agony, but the shrieking continued. It seemed to come from all around me, from within my head, and there was no escaping. I felt the stickiness of blood on my fingers. And I knew the only thing that would make it stop: the mirror.

So, blood streaming down my cheeks, tears welling in my eyes, hands still over my ears, I stumbled to the mirror.

The shrieking stopped when I got there.

But my reflection – was *gone.* I stared back at the glass, seeing a warped version of my bathroom without me in it. As I watched, wondering if I really was going insane, something moved out of the corner of my eye, in the reflection. Something in the mirror, just at the edge of its frame, by the reflected version of my bathroom door – something moved in the shadows.

There was nothing moving at my bathroom door. Whatever had moved…it was only in the mirror.

That was five days ago, I think. I’ve called out of work since. I may lose my job, but I think that’s the least of my worries. Because the murmurs and shrieking and shadows have only gotten worse.

The voices are constant. They tell me the mirror can solve my problems, the mirror is perfect, the mirror is not merely a reflection but is the *real* reality.

First the shrieking wouldn’t let me leave the house. Then the bedroom. Now the bathroom. I’m not sure when I last left the cold tile and white walls and all-encompassing mirror. I’m not sure when I last ate or drank or slept. It’s been hours, at least. Maybe days.

Every time I look in the mirror, I see something move again – something undefinable, just out of reach. The last few times, though, it’s not in the reflection. Most recently, it’s in my house. On *my* side of the mirror. I look at the mirror…and the same shadowy presence moves in the corner of my eye – but at my bathroom door. In my house. And its movement is missing from the reflection.

My face is caked in dried blood. I have my phone – I should have called for help earlier, before it got so bad. But I can’t hear anything anymore, except for the constant whispers telling me to give into the power of the mirror. I think my eardrums have burst. The voices, though, come from everywhere, from within my ears, from within my head.

Maybe I should have texted for help. But the voices turned to screams when I tried that too. They are constant, and they are inescapable, and I think they may be right.

I think the mirror is the only way to stop this torture. I think the mirror may free me.

My reflection isn’t there. But the thing in the shadows is. When I look in the mirror, it moves by the bathroom door. It’s here, with me, just out of view. Waiting. Watching. Reminding me of its presence.

I feel the pull of the mirror, even now. It wants me.

I think I want it too.

There is no escape, from the bathroom or from the world, except through the mirror. Maybe its ornate frame is a gateway. Maybe it will save me. I have to hope so. I have to hope that, if I stand before the mirror and give in to its whisperings and its pleas, that I will be free from these voices and nightmares and pain and madness.

I have to hope that the mirror is the solution, not the end of me, because it’s all I have left.
