After dating someone for a few years, things stop being surprising. The bubbly honeymoon stage has worn off. Instead, you find yourself in a comfortable normal. Today was like any other day. He’d come over, we would watch a movie, eat some food, and he would leave. Not that I don’t enjoy the time we spend together, but it’s predictable. Simple.

This is why I wasn’t surprised he brought me a gift. Why I wasn’t surprised it was wrapped like a child did it, and why I wasn’t surprised to find another stuffed animal. This time, a bear.

“Amaya?” He called. “What do you think?”

“I love him. He’s cute.”

What surprised me was how ugly it was. So ugly it was pitiful. It was stitched crooked, as if it had been sewn in the dark. Its black button eyes were shiny, almost wet in appearance. Its head sat lopsided on his slumping shoulders, round nubs for arms and legs sticking out from all four sides of its beanbag stomach. It was very heavy, feeling like it was stuffed with rocks or magnets. It all came back around to being just barely cute. 

I had never seen a stuffed animal like this before. Ren had either made it for me or dug it out of a dumpster. I asked him, “Where did you even find this thing?”

He turned his head. “That old thrift store up the road. He was sitting behind a pile of throw pillows. The owner said he had never seen him before and let me set the price.”

That old store was the best place to find strange garbage from other people's houses. Everything in there was radioactive, haunted, or broken. “I don’t know why you like that store so much. All the dust gives me a stuffy nose. What were you doing looking behind a pile of throw pillows anyway?”

“I was looking for a present for you. Just because.”

“Well, I’m glad he was back there because I don’t want any throw pillows anyway. This couch is small enough as it is.”

We turned on a familiar movie using the flash drive he always brought over. It had a bunch of movies downloaded on it. I’m not sure how he did it, but he told me not to try. He said I was gonna download a virus instead. He convinced me we don’t need an internet connection, and he makes me my own drives to plug in with all my favorite movies on it for when he isn't over. Kinda like burning a playlist into a CD for your car.

We settled into our spots on the couch, Ren with his legs stretched out and me curled sideways, hugging a balled-up blanket to my chest. The bear sat between us, slumped in the crack of the cushions. He seemed heavier than before, as if he’d sunk deeper into the fabric. His shiny button eyes caught the flicker of the TV. Something was uncanny about him.

I tried to keep my eyes on the screen, but I caught myself glancing at him every so often, checking to see if he had moved. Of course, he hadn’t. His head was still crooked. His stubby arms still gumdrops at his sides. Still, every time I looked, he felt like he was watching me back.

Ren handed me a bowl of popcorn. I took it, brushing his fingers with mine. He smiled, tired, comfortable, and returned to the movie. I forced a smile too, but it felt small.

“Don’t eat it all before I get a bite this time,” he teased.

“Don’t wait until it's gone to get some,” I said back. Our usual banter.

Sometimes I forget how long we’ve been together until I catch him doing something small, like brushing the crumbs off the couch before I sit down, or making sure my glass is filled before his own. It’s not grand gestures with Ren, but this steady rhythm of care. It makes me feel safe, like even if everything else in the world spun out of control, he would still be here, grounding me with those small, quiet acts.

Halfway through the movie, Ren got up to grab a drink. The cushions shifted, and the bear tipped sideways, his heavy body falling against my leg. I picked him up, meaning to set him back, but his weight surprised me again, like lifting a bag of gold coins instead of fabric and fluff. I pressed him against my chest without thinking. He was warm. Too warm, as if he’d been sitting in the sun instead of a dark apartment. I held him there until Ren came back. He gave me a look.

“Why are you staring at the bear like that?”

“He’s kinda freaking me out,” I admitted. “I think he’s just ugly.”

Ren smirked. He sat down and leaned close, his arm brushing mine. I set the bear back between us.

When the movie ended, we didn’t move right away. The credits rolled, white letters drifting past, and we sat in the darkness too comfortable to move. I realized I’d been quiet for a while, too quiet. Ren must have noticed, because he shook my knee. “You awake?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Just tired.” He nodded. We sat in front of the TV until the screen went black and reflected us, two tired people on a couch, and between us, the ugly little bear, grinning.

Ren left not long after. He kissed me goodbye at the door, warm but distracted, already talking about the next movie we’d watch together. I smiled and nodded at the right times, but my thoughts kept drifting back to the bear slumped on the couch.

When the door closed, the apartment felt smaller. Quiet pressed in at the corners. I locked up and walked back to the couch. The bear hadn’t moved. He waited, patient, still smiling. I picked him up again. His weight pulled at my arms, but I carried him into the bedroom anyway.

By the time I set him on the pillow beside me, I had already decided I wasn’t going to let him sleep there. He was too strange, too heavy, too warm. But when I slipped under the covers, I found myself pulling him close anyway. The weight of him against my chest was grounding, like a thick blanket. His button eyes gleamed faintly in the dark. His grin was fixed. I told myself it was just a toy. I closed my eyes. Sleep came quickly, but it did not feel like mine.

The room faded around me. In my sleep, I dreamed. I was walking down a street I didn’t recognize. The pavement stretched on forever, dark and wet, like it had just rained, though I couldn’t remember any clouds. Streetlamps leaned at odd angles, their light faint, buzzing like insects.

My footsteps echoed, too loud in the emptiness. At first, I thought I was alone. Then I saw him, the bear sitting in the middle of the road about twenty yards ahead.

He looked the same as he had on the pillow beside me. Crooked head, lopsided arms, shiny black eyes catching the light. His wide grin seemed brighter here, the sewn thread glinting in the glow of the lamps.

I stopped walking. He didn’t move, of course. The longer I stared, the heavier I felt, like weights were strapped to my chest. My breath became shallow, thin. It felt like the night itself was pushing me toward him, urging me closer. I took a step. The sound of my shoe hitting the wet ground echoed like a thunderstorm.

The bear’s head tilted. Just slightly. I blinked, and the street seemed longer. The bear hadn’t moved, but he was farther away now, the lamps bending closer over him, throwing his crooked shape into a deeper shadow.

A sound followed me as I walked. Not footsteps, but something softer, wet, like fabric being pulled apart. I didn’t dare look behind me. The bear’s button eyes gleamed brighter. His grin looked wider than before, though I told myself it was just the light. 

“Hello?” I tried to call out, but my voice sounded wrong, flat, muffled, like it was wrapped in cotton. The bear’s seams twitched. Something whispered, too faint to make out. It didn’t come from him, not exactly, but from the air around him, from the spaces between the lamps. I kept walking. I don’t know why.

When I finally reached him, the bear was much larger than I expected. Almost up to my waist, slumped but solid, his button eyes staring straight into mine. His grin stretched ear to ear, stitches straining.

I knelt without thinking. My hands reached out, heavy, clumsy. He was warm when I touched him. Too warm. His body throbbed like a pulse. I tried to pull back, but my hands didn’t move. My fingers sank into his fabric as if it were skin. My chest tightened. I couldn’t breathe.

I woke up gasping, arms locked tight around the real bear in my bed. He was warm against my ribs, heavier than before. His crooked grin caught the faint light slipping through the blinds. His shiny button eyes looked wet, almost alive. I swear I saw him breathing.

I lay there with the bear pressed against me, my breath slow and uneven, listening to the hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen and the faint rush of cars out on the street. It felt like the air in the apartment was thicker than usual, stuffy and suffocating.

When I finally rolled over to check the clock, it was already past nine. My head ached in a dull, steady way, and my mouth was dry, as if I’d been breathing through cotton.

I sat up, the bear sliding from my arms onto the sheets beside me. He landed with a heavier thud than seemed right for something stuffed with fluff. I stared at him for a long moment, my dream replaying in flashes, the wet street, the whisper, the unbearable warmth.

“Just a dream,” I muttered, though the words didn’t make it feel any less real.

I swung my legs over the side of the bed. My feet pressed into the carpet, but it felt different, not softer, exactly, but muted, like my skin wasn’t registering it as sharply as usual. I flexed my toes, rubbed my soles against the fibers.

In the kitchen, I filled a glass with water. My hand trembled slightly, the glass knocking against the faucet before I steadied it. The water was cold and clear, but when I drank it, it didn’t refresh me. It slid down my throat like I was drinking nothing at all.

I set the glass on the counter and turned to look back toward the bedroom. The bear was still on the bed, half-buried in the sheets, his shiny button eyes catching the light in a way that made them look wet, alive. Watching. I tried to shake it off.

I busied myself with small things: folding the blanket on the couch, rinsing out the coffee mug Ren had used the night before, rearranging the stack of DVDs by the TV. My thoughts kept circling back to the dream. To the whispering. To the strange way I felt. Lighter in some places, heavier in others, as though something had been taken out of me and replaced with something foreign.

When I finally went back into the bedroom to make the bed, I found the bear sitting upright against the pillow. I froze in the doorway. I didn’t remember leaving him like that. I had dropped him. I was sure of it, but there he was, crooked head tilted, grin stretched wide.

For a long time, I stood there staring at him. The apartment was silent except for the humming appliances and the faint tick of the wall clock. Then I forced a laugh. “Guess I tossed you around more than I thought.”

I picked him up. He was heavy, warm, almost clammy. I placed him back at the head of the bed, leaning him against the wall. His grin stayed fixed, crooked and too wide.

This bear is taking up way too much space in my mind. I tried to tell myself I was fine. I made coffee. The machine sputtered and hissed like it always did, filling the apartment with that bitter smell. I wrapped my hands around the mug and sat on the couch, staring at the TV. I didn’t even turn it on.

The coffee tasted wrong. Flat, and stagnant, like a cup of soda left out all night. I added sugar, then cream, then more sugar, until the cup was pale and syrupy. Still nothing. My tongue registered the warmth, the texture, but the taste seemed blank, as though my mouth had forgotten what sweetness was. I left the mug on the table.

I spent most of the late morning cleaning. It was mechanical. I did the dishes, counters, sweeping. Normally, I’d play music while I worked, but I didn’t feel like it. The silence draped down on me, heavy but somehow comfortable.

Every so often, I’d catch myself glancing toward the bedroom. I told myself I wasn’t checking on him, the bear, but I was. I couldn’t shake the image of him sitting up against the pillow, his grin too wide, his button eyes glistening.

At one point, while wiping down the counter, I heard something faint from down the hall. A small thump. I froze, rag in hand, listening. Nothing. Just the rattling of the dryer. When I peeked in, the bear was where I’d left him, leaning crookedly against the wall. Still, I closed the door this time.

By afternoon, my phone buzzed with a text.

*Ren: You alive?*

I stared at it for a long while before typing back: *Yeah. Just tired.*

A minute later: *Alright. You good?*

I hesitated, then wrote: *Yeah. Just didn’t sleep well.*

He sent a thumbs-up emoji. No more after that.

I set the phone down and rubbed my face. Even texting felt like a chore, like stringing words together cost me something extra today. Around four, I realized I hadn’t eaten anything. My stomach growled, but I wasn’t hungry. I made a sandwich anyway.

The bread was stale. The lettuce limp. The meat had gone a little gray around the edges and was a little too oily. I ate half of it standing at the counter before tossing the rest in the trash. The whole time, I couldn’t shake the sense that I was being watched. Not from the window. Not from the door. From the bedroom. The bear sat behind that closed door like a secret, and I hated that I knew he was there.

The day stretched long. The light shifted from gray to orange, pouring across the living room carpet, dust floating lazily in its beams. I tried to watch a movie from the drive Ren had left me, but after ten minutes, I couldn’t follow the plot. The voices blurred together, and I kept staring at the reflection of the hallway on the TV screen. From where I sat, I could see the bedroom door.

I muted the TV. The silence settled in again. A drag across the carpet. Slow. Long. Like fabric shifting, something heavy being pulled an inch at a time. The sound came from behind the closed bedroom door. I didn’t move at first. My whole body locked, mug of cold coffee still in my hands.

The sound didn’t repeat. The apartment was still, the air ringing faintly in my ears. Finally, I set the mug down and stood. My legs felt heavier than they should, my chest tight as though I was about to give a presentation. I stepped closer to the door, pressed my ear against it.

Silence. I opened the door. The bear was still on the bed. Propped upright, grinning, button eyes catching the last of the sunset through the blinds. Exactly where I’d left him. The rug by the door had shifted, pushed an inch out of place. I closed the door again. This time, I locked it.

When the sun went down, I couldn’t convince myself to cook dinner. I made tea instead. Sat on the couch, cup cooling between my hands, staring at the dark window.

I am not sure why this stuffed animal commanded so much of my attention. It was like he was constantly calling my name. The anxiety I felt was ruining me. I hadn’t been able to do anything today. The bear took it all from me.

Sitting on the couch, I felt the words fade around me, like a vignette at the end of an old silent film. My ears rang louder, my heart beat faster. I felt a small pull on the side of my head yank on me. It felt like someone was pulling my hair. Not enough to hurt, but enough to notice.

My breathing got shallower and shallower. My heart beat faster and faster. I couldn’t hear myself weeping over the ringing in my ears, like a fire alarm. I needed to sleep, but I couldn’t. I have to take control of myself.

The locked bedroom door stood at the edge of my vision. I didn’t want to open it again. Not tonight. Still, when I was composed enough to stand, I did. The bear was waiting, exactly where he had been. I picked him up, heavy and warm in my arms. Despite myself, I carried him to bed.

I woke up to bright light pushing through the blinds. The room looked the same as always. My sheets tangled around me, the faint hum of the kitchen in the distance, the sound of a car passing on the street outside. I sat up, stretching my arms, and glanced toward the far corner of the bed.

The bear sat propped against the pillow. His crooked grin seemed wider in the morning light, his button eyes catching the pale glow. I thought for a second he looked larger. Not by much, just enough that his head seemed to sit higher against the wall than I remembered. I shook it off. Morning haze. I smoothed the sheets, tugged the blanket up, and tucked it neatly around the pillows. The bear stayed where he was, heavy and solid, watching.

In the kitchen, I filled the kettle and made tea instead of coffee. My stomach felt hollow, but not hungry. I dropped a piece of bread in the toaster, spread jam on it, and ate while leaning against the counter. The jam was too sweet, sticking to the roof of my mouth. I washed it down with the bitter tea.

I picked up my phone.

*Morning. Come over later?*

A few minutes passed before the reply came.

*Sure. Movie night again?*

*Yeah.*

I set the phone face down and pulled a puzzle box off the shelf. It was a thousand-piece puzzle, an old photo of a seaside town. Cobblestone streets, leaning houses, a tangle of boats in the harbor. I spread the pieces out across the table, edges first. The work was slow, but satisfying.

I couldn’t help glancing toward the bedroom door every so often. I’d left it open, the bed visible from where I sat. The bear sat propped against the pillow, larger than life in my peripheral vision.

When I looked directly at him, he seemed the same. Crooked head, slumped arms, and that unsettling smile.

By afternoon, I was cleaning again. Dishes, counters, the same rhythm as always. The smell of lemon cleaner clung to my hands. Every so often, I’d think about calling Ren, telling him not to come. I never did. Instead, I swept the floor, dusted the shelves, and checked the puzzle again. When the knock came that evening, I opened the door to find him standing there with his familiar crooked smile, flash drive in hand.

“Hey,” he said. “You look tired.”

“I didn’t sleep well.”

He shrugged, kicked his shoes off, and settled onto the couch like he’d done a hundred times before. I turned on the TV, and he plugged the flash drive in.

We watched something familiar, something I couldn’t bring myself to follow. I curled against him, my eyes drifting, the flicker of the screen painting his face in blue and gray.

Every so often, I thought I could hear something shifting in the bedroom. A faint drag, like fabric across carpet. But Ren didn’t notice, and I didn’t say anything. When the credits rolled, he stood and stretched. “I’ll head out.” I walked him to the door, kissed him goodbye, and watched him go.

The apartment felt heavier the second the door closed. Quiet pressed in like a weight. I turned out the lights one by one, leaving the bedroom for last. The bear sat upright on the bed, waiting, larger than before. His button eyes caught the dark and gleamed like wet stone. I slid under the covers, pulling them up to my chin. The bear loomed against the wall. Sleep came heavy, dragging me down before I could think too much about it.

I woke up to light pushing through the blinds. For a moment, I thought I hadn’t slept at all. The sheets were tangled the same way, the buzzing of the refrigerator steady in the background, a car hissing down the street outside. It felt familiar. Too familiar.

I sat up slowly. The bear was waiting, as he had been, propped against the pillow. His head tilted slightly to one side, grin taut in the dim morning light. He looked bigger now. Not much, but enough that I felt it in my chest. His round belly filled more of the pillow’s width, his stubby legs dangling lower. I stared for too long. Then I shook out the blankets, smoothed the bed, and tried to pretend nothing was wrong.

Breakfast was toast, jam, and tea. I leaned against the counter as I chewed, staring at the streaks of sunlight across the floor. It all felt like a memory. Not something happening now, but something I had already lived once.

My phone buzzed.

*Ren: Morning. You around later?*

I froze. I could already see the words before I read them. My thumb hovered over the keyboard, a strange dread filling me.

*Yeah. Movie night again?* I typed back before realizing that wasn’t what I meant to write. The message sent anyway.

The puzzle box was waiting on the shelf. A thousand pieces, seaside town. I hesitated before opening it. Hadn’t I already done this?

Still, I spread the pieces across the table, edges first. My fingers moved like they remembered where some pieces went, sliding them together before I even studied the shapes. By midday, the border was finished. I stared down at it, unsettled. Yesterday, or whenever it was, I had only gotten halfway through the frame.

My eyes drifted toward the bedroom door. Open again, the bed was visible from my seat. The bear sat against the pillow, his head almost reaching the top now.

I turned my back on him and focused on the puzzle.

The afternoon stretched. Cleaning again, the same motions: dishes, counters, sweeping. But the lemon cleaner smelled stronger this time, sharp in my nose, stinging my eyes. I paused in the middle of the kitchen and muttered aloud: “I’ve done this before.” The words didn’t sound like mine. They fell flat in the empty room.

The knock came in the evening, exactly when I expected it. Ren stood there, flash drive in hand, smiling. “Hey,” he said. “You look tired.”

My stomach dropped. I remembered the words. Exactly those words. “I didn’t sleep well,” I heard myself reply. He shrugged, kicked off his shoes, and settled onto the couch.

The movie flickered on, familiar in every beat, though I couldn’t place the title. Ren laughed at one point, the same laugh, the same timing. It chilled me, though he didn’t notice.

Halfway through, I thought I heard something dragging across the bedroom carpet. Louder this time. Like something heavy shifting its weight.

I stared toward the hallway until Ren nudged me. “You okay?”

“Yeah,” I said. My voice didn’t sound right.

When the credits rolled, he stood and stretched. “I’ll head out.”

I walked him to the door. Kissed him goodbye. Watched him go.

I turned out the lights one by one, leaving the bedroom for last. The bear loomed against the pillow, unmistakably bigger now. His button eyes gleamed wetly in the dark, following me. I slipped under the covers, heart pounding. As sleep dragged me under, one thought circled in my head, relentless:

*This already happened.*

I woke up with a start. The blinds bled pale light across the floor. The refrigerator hummed, steady as a metronome. A car hissed past outside.



I didn’t move right away. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, dreading what I already knew I would see.When I finally turned my head, the bear sat propped against the pillow. He was bigger.

No pretending this time. No trick of the light. His belly ballooned outward, round and tight like a watermelon. His stubby arms stretched farther, seams groaning faintly at the shoulders. His head, tilted at its familiar crooked angle, nearly reached the top of the pillow.

I sat up, covers pooling in my lap.

“I swear you could fit in my hand yesterday,” I whispered.

I made the bed, but my movements were frantic, clumsy. My fingers snagged the sheets, tugging too hard, trying to bury him beneath them. But when I smoothed the blanket flat, he sat on top again, heavier than ever, button eyes shining.

Breakfast was worse. The bread had gone stiff, the jam sticky, too sweet. The tea scalded my tongue even though it had cooled by the time I drank it. Every bite tasted like dust. I chewed anyway, just to fill the silence.

My phone buzzed.

*Ren: Morning. You around later?*

I dropped the phone onto the counter like it had burned me.

The message glowed on the screen, exactly as before. I didn’t want to reply, but my thumb moved anyway, typing words I didn’t choose: *Yeah. Movie night again?*

Sent.

My breath came sharp and shallow.

The puzzle waited on the shelf. I didn’t want to touch it, but I couldn’t stop myself. My fingers pulled the box down, spilled the pieces across the table. The edges fell into place too easily. Like they had been waiting. My hands moved without my brain’s permission, snapping pieces together in a rhythm I couldn’t break.

When I looked up, the border was finished again. More of it this time, the harbor already taking shape, little boats floating in place. I shoved the pieces away, chest tight. From the bedroom, the bear sat in plain sight. His seams looked swollen, strained. His grin stretched wider, thread pulling taut. I turned him to face the wall. But when I glanced back, he was looking at me again.

By afternoon, I had stopped pretending. I walked in circles around the apartment, muttering under my breath. “It’s the same. The same. I’ve done this before.”

When I caught my reflection in the microwave door, I didn’t recognize myself. My eyes looked flat. Colorless. My mouth set in a line I didn’t remember making. The sound came earlier this time. Not a faint drag, a heavy shift. Like something massive dragging itself an inch across the carpet.

I froze in the kitchen doorway. The bear wasn’t in the bedroom anymore. He sat just inside the hall, half-shadowed, his belly wide as a barrel. The knock came. Right on time. Ren, smiling, flash drive in hand. “You look tired,” he said, voice warm and familiar.

I laughed, too loudly. “Don’t you have anything else to say?”

He blinked at me. “What?”

“You always say that. Every time. Then we watch a movie, and you leave, and then I-” My throat closed around the rest.

He frowned, concern flickering. “Hey. You okay?”

The bear loomed in the corner of the hall, visible just over Ren’s shoulder. His shadow stretched long across the carpet. I wanted to scream. Instead, I let him in.

The movie blurred. Ren laughed at the same parts again, though I couldn’t remember what the joke was. I stared at the bear. He had followed us into the living room. Sat just beyond the glow of the TV, bigger now, seams creaking with every faint shift of his body.

When Ren left, I didn’t walk him to the door. I couldn’t take my eyes off the bear. I went to bed with him watching from the corner, his stitched smile enormous in the dark. Sleep swallowed me whole.

I woke up already exhausted.

The light through the blinds felt too sharp, like it was cutting across the room instead of just shining in. My head ached, my mouth was dry, and every part of me felt bruised, though I couldn’t remember hitting anything.

I rolled over and froze.

The bear sat against the pillow.

Only he wasn’t a bear anymore. His body had stretched into something grotesque, longer arms, a round torso that bulged outward, stubby legs dangling over the edge of the bed. He was the size of a ten-year-old child now, slumped in place but impossibly solid. His head tilted, crooked grin tearing wide across his face, stitches straining.

I clutched the blanket to my chest and whispered, “You weren’t this big yesterday.”

I made the bed around him, barely touching him, dragging the sheets up while my hands trembled. He was too heavy to move now, too large to pretend he hadn’t changed. My breath rasped shallowly as I backed out of the room.

In the kitchen, I fumbled through breakfast. Burnt toast. Tea too bitter to drink. My hands shook so badly I spilled jam across the counter.

The phone buzzed.

*Ren: Morning. You around later?*

I laughed. Same as yesterday.

I typed *No*, but when I looked again, the screen showed: *Yeah. Movie night again?*

Sent. My hands shook harder. The puzzle waited. I didn’t want to touch it. I sat down anyway. My hands moved without thought, sliding pieces together like magnets. The harbor sprang up in minutes, boats, rooftops, water, all falling into place as though they’d been assembled before. I slammed my fists down, scattering the pieces, chest heaving.

From the corner of my eye, I saw movement. The bear sat in the hallway, watching. His smile stretched wider now, teeth glinting through frayed seams.

I scrubbed the counters until my hands cracked. Tiny crescent moons cut into my palms where I’d gripped the rag too tightly. The lemon cleaner stung, sharp in my nose, bitter on my tongue.

I muttered as I worked, words falling out in fragments. “It’s the same, it’s the same, it’s the same…”

The air grew heavy. I swore I heard the bear breathing, slow and wet, each exhale filling the room.

The knock came in the evening. I opened the door too fast, Ren startled by the motion. He gave me his easy smile, flash drive in hand. “Hey. You look tired.”

I snapped.

“You always say that.”

He blinked. “What?”

“You say it every time. Every single time. ‘You look tired.’ Then we watch your stupid movie, and you leave.” My voice cracked. “I wake up and it starts all over again.”

He frowned. “Amaya, slow down. What are you talking about?”

“I’m talking about him.” I pointed toward the hall.

The bear sat in the doorway, child-sized, seams creaking as his round belly shifted. His button eyes gleamed in the dim light, grin splitting wider than ever.

Ren turned, looked at the hallway, then back at me. “It’s just a stuffed animal.”

“No, it’s not,” I hissed. “You don’t get it. He’s bigger. Every day he’s bigger. He’s eating something. He’s eating *me*.”

Ren stepped forward, reaching for my arm. “You’re scaring me. Maybe we should-”

I ripped my arm away. “You don’t believe me.”

“Because you’re not making sense!” His voice snapped sharply, louder than I’d ever heard. His face twisted in anger. Or fear. For a moment, silence sunk between us. Only the faint creak of seams broke it, the bear’s swollen body shifting in the hall.

I felt the anger rise like bile.

“Get out,” I whispered.

Ren stared at me. “What?”

“Get out! If you won’t believe me, then leave!”

He opened his mouth, closed it again, then shook his head. “Fine. Whatever this is, I’ll come back when you’ve slept.”

He grabbed his shoes and slammed the door behind him. The echo of it rattled the walls. I went straight to sleep.

I woke up and my chest was tight, my head pounding like someone was hammering inside my skull.

He was there. The bear. Bigger. Always bigger. Slumped against the headboard, his grin wider than I remembered, one button eye dangling like a tear. My hands trembled. I pressed my palms to my face, trying to force myself awake. Trying to tell myself it wasn’t real.

It was. I could feel it. The air was heavier than yesterday. Every part of me screamed that this was real. I grabbed my pocket knife from the nightstand before I even thought. My hands shook so badly I could barely hold it. “This is a dream,” I whispered, but the words rang loudly in my ears. “This has to be a dream.”

I pressed the blade to my palm. The metal bit into my skin, sharp and cold. I pushed it down deep. Blood pooled up, warm and almost black. Fat swelled around the blade as I dragged it across my palm. My knees buckled, and I sank to the floor. 

I scream, a high, jagged scream that made my ears ring. “Not a dream… not a dream… not a dream!”

The blood dripped down my wrists, staining the sheets, the carpet, the floor. I traced lines along my arms, over my chest, desperate to feel that this was real, desperate to know that I wasn’t trapped in some endless, repeating nightmare.

I didn’t eat. I didn’t care about breakfast. I didn’t care about anything. The bread sat rotting on the counter. Dishes teetered in the sink. My hands left smears of blood wherever they touched.

The puzzle. I couldn’t even look at it. My fingers shook too violently to try. I slammed my fists onto the table, scattering pieces across the carpet.

Everywhere I turned, he was there. The bear. In the hallway. On the couch. By the window. Always closer, always larger, always watching.

Ren came over later, like always.

I opened the door, and the second he stepped inside, I screamed.

“You! You brought him! Look!” I pointed, voice trembling, raw. The bear was there, now human-sized, massive, looming. It's seams strained, stitches splitting open.

Ren’s eyes widened, but he stepped closer anyway. “Amaya… what is that? That’s not the bear I-”

Before he could finish, a tearing sound ripped across the apartment like a chainsaw.

The bear’s chest split open. A sharp, wet ripping that made me want to gag. Then, cotton. White, soft, endless cotton poured from the bear’s chest. It surged forward like a tide. Rushing out of its body like an army of rats. An infestation.

It hit my legs first, creeping over my feet, climbing higher, pressing against my stomach. I flinched as it clawed at my mouth. I scraped at it, panicked, but it kept crawling. I could feel it moving beneath the surface.

I was swollen, cotton breaking down and filling all the pores in my skin. I felt it wiggle around the hairs on my arm and push deeper. It flooded my blood like an IV. My mouth tried to scream, out of instinct, but nothing came out. Stuffing had wormed its way deep into my throat, spreading down my body. It filled my eyes, drying them out. I could barely see. My nose was completely clogged.

Ren screamed beside me, his hands trying to push it away. It filled his mouth, his ears, his eyes. I could see him struggle, his chest heaving, and then cotton started crawling into him too, moving like it had a mind of its own, spilling from the bear’s open chest, endlessly.

We both contorted as the cotton burrowed its way through us, swallowing us whole. My own body felt foreign, swollen, unreal. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move.

Then nothing.

Black.

I opened my eyes.

I couldn’t see. Couldn’t feel. Couldn’t breathe. There was only nothing.

Ren stood across from me. His lips moved, but no sound came out. We locked eyes. A dark abyss sprawled out ahead of us, darker than anything I have ever seen. 

In the distance, I could see a small opening just sealing shut. In the glimpse of light I saw, myself. It was me, and it was Ren. Ren was convulsing, shaking in the arms of a girl who looked just like me. 

It couldn’t be him. He was standing right next to me, terrified. Ren, this Ren, my Ren, had small bits of cotton stuck to the wet parts of his eyes. I held his hand. We looked deeper, deeper into the void, and we heard a voice. Maybe, two voices. I don’t remember what they said.

I still have access to my phone, and I can still post. Ill keep you updated with what happens next.
