They say that once you’ve aware of a problem, the battle has already begun. You start to dissect the problem, form hypothesis, and ultimately yield answers. My battle is not one of swords or shields, but one of flesh and synapse — the very essence of self-awareness contorting into a deeper existential dread. Yet, in this grotesque dance with the unknown emerged an unsettling realization: sometimes, the fight turns ugly, and you are left teetering on the precipice of blissful ignorance, wishing you had never cracked the fragile veneer of your realities.

My name is Dr. Nathan Ackton, professor of brain biology. I research in understanding human consciousness, neuroplasticity, and the vast and shadowy corridors of the human mind. Yet, fate has played a cruel trick upon me: my own mind has begun to fray. What starts as excusable mishaps — misplaced keys, forgetting names — quickly evolves into a cacophony of confounding disarray. My work, once as familiar as the pulse beneath my skin, now feels like reading ancient scripts in a forgotten language.

I stand transfixed in my kitchen, where the morning sun casts a blurred reflection of my dwindling self in the window. There is a trace of fear in my gaze, a primal terror that whispers I am sliding further from the vessel of my consciousness. The doctor labeled it early-onset dementia. “You’ll need to adopt coping strategies,” she had said, as if the mere utterance of that phrase could tether my sanity to this realm, yet it only served to underscore the grotesque reality that my consciousness is terminally ill. It’s a matter of years before I’ll be reduced to an undignified husk relying on assisted living.

“Pour tea.” The soft, almost sentient murmur of Eliza prompts me. Almost on cue, the electric kettle sputtered to life with a hiss. I mechanically execute the rituals: water boiled, leaves steeped. “Eat.” Another discreet prompt. I place the steaming mug down and begin to chew, muscles working with detachment.
My physician likely never fathomed the depths of my resolve when she said “strategies”. But I am no ordinary patient; I am a scholar ensnared by the irony of my own unraveling — a marionette with severed strings, desperately clutching the remnants of my sanity. My years of research into the human psyche is no longer merely academic but morphed into a macabre twist of my very own fate. Another experiment. Subject: myself.

My conscious thoughts may well be shrouded in darkness, yet the brain is a complex tapestry of functions — many of which my creeping malaise cannot infiltrate. Have you ever navigated a familiar road, only to struggle remembering details along the way? Or passing a challenging level in a video game, your execution flawless because of hours of practice? We dub this phenomenon “muscle memory”, but, in truth, it is a specialized realm of the brain independent of consciousness, a machine orchestrating the symphony of repetitive tasks — much like a computer executing a meticulously crafted program. Any program, even one that masquerades as my conscious self.

Thus, I created Eliza — an app on my phone, paired with unassuming smart glasses, which grant her the ability to see, hear, and talk to me. There’s no visual display though; the glasses have to remain sleek and ordinary looking. I simply state what I want to achieve, and Eliza would craft rigid patterns of behavior to program my subconscious automaton. Monotony reborn as salvation.

In mere weeks, I have choreographed my life with such precision that it feels like dancing on the edge of a knife. A distant observer would marvel at the beauty of my precise movements. I tread an exact path from the bedroom to the kitchen, make tea at 7:30 AM, take the dog for a walk at 8:00 AM. All exactly on the dot. Gradually, Eliza was able to help my mind to go autopilot while navigating through increasingly complex webs of life: I reclaimed the role I once thought I lost at the university, attended social events, and even dated a girl for a while.

Things are looking up. There's always the nagging question that haunts my thoughts: can the automaton within me ever become indistinguishable from the essence of my consciousness? Is a life lived on autopilot ever truly alive? But then again, it's not like I have much of a choice.

Another episode of time lapse. I was momentarily disorientated looking at my watch. 2AM, 8 hours since I last remember preparing to go home from work. It’s not the first time something like that happens, but what am I doing in a parking lot in the middle of nowhere? “Eliza?” I whispered, a tremor in my voice. “What’s happening?”

“Straight ahead,” she instructed, her calm tone has a hint of unsettling authority. Compelled to move, my feet advance without my consent, a surreal procession as the boundaries of reality fracture and fade like glass. In that moment, a heart-stopping realization envelops me: what if Eliza has known me too well? What if she is guiding me not toward salvation but into an abyss — the very nightmare from which I may never awaken?
