I used to think camping was boring. Trees, bugs, silence—what was the point? But now, I'd give anything to go back to that kind of boring.

It started three days ago.

Dad and I had driven up to Black Hollow Ridge, this stretch of wilderness in the Sierra Nevadas. He called it a "bonding trip." I called it "dad trying too hard since Mom left." But I didn’t complain. We hadn’t done anything together since the divorce, and he seemed… desperate.

The first night was normal—crackling fire, half-burnt hot dogs, stars like diamonds. The second night… that’s when everything changed.

We heard something in the woods. Not the usual rustle of deer or raccoons. This was heavier. Measured. Like it had a purpose. Dad went to check it out with his flashlight. I stayed by the fire, watching his beam vanish between the pines.

He didn’t come back.

Not right away, at least.

When he finally returned, his face was pale, and his voice was off. Like someone trying to sound like him but missing the rhythm. Too calm. Too... smooth. He smiled too much. Blinked too little. I kept asking what happened. He said, “Just a raccoon,” but he wouldn’t look me in the eyes.

That night, I didn’t sleep.

By morning, I noticed the skin on his neck was… shifting. Like it wasn’t sure what it was supposed to look like. For a second, I saw a shimmer, like heat rising off pavement. Then green scales. Just a flash. Gone.

I ran.

Now I’m three miles from camp, hiding in a ranger's cabin that smells like mold and regret, and I'm writing this because I need to remember who I am, and what I have to do.

My name is Liam Suarez. I'm sixteen. And something wearing my father’s skin is hunting me.

But I’m going to hunt it first.

I didn’t have a weapon. Just a pocketknife, a half-dead phone with no signal, and the ranger’s cabin map tacked to the wall. I traced the route back to camp with my finger, heart thudding like a war drum. He—it—would be looking for me by now. The thing pretending to be my dad.

I wasn’t going back to reason with it.

I was going back to end it.

I grabbed an old hatchet from a rusted emergency box, wiped off the cobwebs, and stuffed a flare into my jacket. I don’t know why—felt like I’d need fire.

The woods felt different as I moved through them. Too quiet. No birdsong, no snapping twigs. Just this weird, low hum in the air, like something barely out of hearing. I crept down the trail, every shadow twitching in my periphery. Then I heard it.

My dad’s voice.

"Liam! Son, where are you? We need to go home!"

It was too perfect. Every syllable exactly how he used to say it. Not like last night, when he talked like a bad actor. This time, he sounded like him.

That was worse.

I crouched behind a boulder and watched.

There he was—kneeling by the fire pit we’d built, face buried in his hands. Shoulders shaking. Sobbing.

“Please, buddy. I don’t know what’s happening to me.”

And for a second—I almost believed it.

Until he looked up.

His eyes were the giveaway. Not brown anymore. No whites. Just a kaleidoscope of colors, swirling like oil on water. And his skin rippled again—shimmering green, then tan, then something with feathers, then back to Dad.

I stepped out from behind the rock.

“I know you’re not him.”

The thing froze. Its head twitched like a lizard scanning for prey. Then it stood. The sobs stopped. It smiled that wrong smile again.

“I was hoping we could avoid this,” it said, and its voice shifted mid-sentence. A chorus of sounds underneath. Like it hadn’t decided which voice to use.

I lifted the hatchet. My hands were shaking, but my stance was solid. “Where is he?”

“Still here. Somewhere,” it said, tapping its skull. “He’s strong. Fought back harder than most.”

I lunged.

The hatchet struck its arm—but the skin split and slid away like liquid glass, reshaping instantly. It hissed and knocked me down with a single, inhuman swipe. I rolled, came up bloody, but alive.

“You can’t win, Liam,” it whispered, standing over me now. “But you can join him. You don’t have to be alone anymore.”

I fumbled for the flare. Pulled the cap. Scratched it to life.

A burst of red fire.

The thing shrieked and flinched away, skin convulsing in a cascade of colors. Smoke hissed off its body where the light touched it.

So light hurts it.

Good to know.

I didn’t wait. I ran into the woods, flare in one hand, hatchet in the other, breath ragged in my lungs. I wasn’t just going to survive this.

I was going to find a way to burn that thing out of my dad’s body.

Even if it killed me.

I ran until the trees blurred, my legs screaming and lungs on fire. When I finally stopped, I was deep in a ravine choked with fallen logs and thornbrush. The flare was dying—just a red ember now. I shoved it into the mud to keep it burning a little longer, then pulled out the ranger’s map, lit by its dying glow.

There was a spot about half a mile north: “Miller’s Drop.” A cliffside overlook with a sheer edge and a firewatch platform built into the rocks. It gave me an idea.

If I couldn’t beat the thing head-on, I’d outsmart it.

I made my way there under cover of darkness, keeping low, staying quiet. Every few minutes I’d hear it—branches snapping in the wrong rhythm, or my dad’s voice calling from too far, too fast.

It was toying with me now.

When I got to the overlook, I worked fast. I found an old ranger supply box near the firewatch platform—inside: two flares, rope, and a busted propane lantern. Jackpot.

I set the trap on instinct, like I’d done this a hundred times in games but never in real life.

I looped the rope around a thick tree trunk, then tied the other end to a metal support beam on the edge of the cliff. I soaked the platform in lantern fuel, doused a trail leading into it, and made a pile of dry pine needles at the center. A perfect ignition point.

I’d be the bait. Lure it in. When it stepped onto the soaked wood—light it up.

And if that didn’t work?

The drop was 200 feet straight down into rocks.

I crouched behind a thicket, flare ready, waiting. The forest was holding its breath. Then, like a knife through velvet—

“I’m proud of you, son.”

He walked out of the trees like he belonged to them. Calm. Confident. Like a shadow wearing my dad’s skin. Except now, it didn’t even try to hide. Scales flickered across its face. Its jaw unhinged just a little too wide when it smiled.

“You’re smarter than most,” it said. “But this ends now.”

“Yeah,” I said, standing up, backing toward the platform. “It does.”

It followed.

Step by step.

Onto the fuel-soaked wood.

“Where’s my dad?” I asked, fingers tight around the flare cap.

It grinned.

“Closer than you think.”

I lit the flare.

The fire leapt across the trail like a living thing. Flames engulfed the platform instantly—orange and red tearing through the dark. The thing screamed, a high-pitched shriek that split the trees, clawing at its body as the fire danced over it. I saw the skin writhe, break, and change—eyes becoming slits, then orbs, then something insectoid. Its whole form glitched like it couldn’t decide what to be.

Then—

The platform collapsed.

It plummeted into the dark, trailing smoke and sparks, vanishing into the abyss.

Silence.

I stood there, flare still burning, breathing smoke and disbelief.

“Dad?” I whispered.

No answer.

But somewhere down there, buried in the wreckage or maybe still alive inside that thing, he might be waiting.

And I wasn’t done yet.

I’ve never been this deep into the earth before, and now I understand why people say it’s like being swallowed. The walls of the cave were alive—or close enough. They pulsed with a faint, wet glow that wasn’t natural, wasn’t human. I moved deeper, flare in one hand, hatchet in the other, every step pulling me further from the world I knew.

The trail of black, tar-thick blood twisted ahead of me, like it was guiding me. Or daring me.

I kept thinking: What if he's still in there? What if it’s not too late?

The cave narrowed and widened in strange intervals, like I was walking through the veins of some enormous creature. The air grew hotter, thicker, and the ground beneath my boots felt soft. Almost spongy.

Then I heard it again—his voice. My dad’s. Faint. Echoing off the stone.

“Liam…”

I broke into a run.

Turned a corner—and stopped cold.

The chamber opened wide. At its center, a mass of something alive and wrong pulsed like a heart. Dark tendrils stretched from it to the walls, anchoring it like roots. The creature—the alien—was part of it now. Embedded in it. Half-absorbed, half-fighting.

And wrapped in the tendrils, like a cocoon or a cage, was him.

My real dad.

He was still whole—barely. Pale, unconscious, mouth slack. But he was alive.

I stepped forward—and the creature responded. It peeled itself from the wall, dripping with fluids that hissed as they hit the floor. Its form shifted again, bones cracking like dry twigs. For a heartbeat, it looked just like me. Then like my mom. Then like something that had no face at all.

“Leave,” it gurgled, voice not one but many, layered and broken. “This form is claimed. You cannot win.”

“You took my father,” I growled, lifting the hatchet, the flare burning bright and angry in my fist. “I’m taking him back.”

It lunged.

I dodged. Barely.

It moved like liquid—no weight, no pattern, just raw instinct. I swung the flare in an arc, the light burning a gash across its skin. It shrieked, backing into the wall like a wounded animal, smoke pouring off its body.

I didn’t hesitate.

I charged.

I buried the hatchet deep into its chest—if it even had one. It screamed again, louder this time, and the cave walls trembled like they were in pain. The cocoon around my dad twitched, then split, spilling him out onto the floor.

I yanked him up, dragging him away.

“Dad!” I shouted, shaking him. “You have to wake up!”

His eyes fluttered open.

“L-Liam…?”

He barely got the word out before the ground buckled beneath us. The heart-like mass was rupturing, leaking black ichor and shrieking in a dozen alien languages. The creature was dying—but not fast enough.

I shoved the last flare into the split in its chest and lit it.

Fire exploded across its body, catching the tendrils, the mass, everything. The cave lit up like a furnace. I threw Dad over my shoulder, turned, and ran like hell as the walls began to collapse.

Behind us, the alien howled one last time—then went silent.

We reached the surface just before dawn.

My arms ached. My lungs burned. But Dad was alive.

And whatever had come down in that ravine… was staying there.

For now.
