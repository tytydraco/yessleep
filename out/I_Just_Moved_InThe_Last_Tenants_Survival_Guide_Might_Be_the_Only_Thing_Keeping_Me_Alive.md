I’d only been living in my new apartment for a week when I found the note. It was folded and wedged behind the breaker panel in the hallway—a place I never would’ve looked if my lights hadn’t gone out that night. The handwriting on the envelope was shaky and thin, and it was addressed simply to: “The New Tenant, Apt. 4C.”

I should’ve tossed it. But I was still feeling out this new home, still unsettled by the shape of it, the odd angles of the walls, the musty scent that came and went with no pattern. The people next door—when I caught a glimpse of them—moved as if uncertain how human bodies should work. And then there was the old woman I sometimes spotted by the mailboxes, muttering about “the time coming ‘round again.”

I wanted answers, so I sat on my dusty couch under the flickering emergency lamp and read.

Dear Tenant of 4C,

I lived here before you. If you’re reading this, I never came back for my things. Good. Don’t search for me. Just know I’m sorry to leave you with this burden, but no one warned me, and I believe you deserve a chance.

This building has rules. They’re not posted anywhere official, but you’ll understand why soon enough. Follow them carefully. If you don’t, you’ll regret it. We all do.

1. Never acknowledge the knocking at your door if it happens after 2:17 a.m. It starts softly—a gentle tap-tap-tap—and escalates to something desperate. No matter how human it sounds, do not open that door. You may hear a familiar voice. Ignore it. They want in. Don’t let them in.

2. If you take the elevator after midnight, don’t look at your reflection in the metal doors. If you catch its eyes, it will smile. Do not smile back. Press your floor button without blinking and do not look up until the doors open again. If you look too soon, you might find yourself stepping out onto a hallway that doesn’t belong to our building—or this world.

3. On the third Wednesday of each month, a man in a green jacket stands at the end of the hall near the fire escape. He will tip his hat at you and hold out his hand. Do not give him anything—no spare change, no greeting, not even a glance. Lock yourself in your apartment, turn the bathroom tap on full, and hum a tune until you hear him leave. The humming helps. I don’t know why.

4. Sometimes, you’ll smell something sweet and wrong in your bedroom—like overripe fruit and spoiled milk. If you wake to that smell between 1:11 and 1:33 a.m., don’t turn on the lights. There’s something perched on top of the dresser, watching. It hates sudden brightness. Just close your eyes and pretend to sleep. It’ll leave before your alarm rings, I promise.

5. The letter you received from management (I’m sure they gave you one) mentions no pets are allowed. That’s for your own safety. Strays come to the hallway sometimes—hairless cats, or so they seem. If one follows you inside, never let it be alone with any leftover food. That’s how they get stronger.

6. If you run into Mrs. Dalton from 5B, and she tells you about her grandchildren visiting upstairs in units long abandoned—ignore her. Smile, nod, and move on. Those units are empty. Have been for years, since the fire. Anyone claiming otherwise wants you to join them. Don’t.

7. Lastly, if you find a note like this one and think it’s a joke, that’s your choice. But you’ve probably already noticed things: The damp patch on your ceiling that changes shape nightly, the way your reflection sometimes lags in the hall mirror, the whistling you can’t quite place. The whistling is worst of all. When it starts, you must not investigate. Let it pass. To acknowledge it is to invite it closer, and you don’t want that.

I’m sorry. I tried to follow the rules and failed. I left in a hurry. I don’t know if you can make it here, but maybe you’re stronger than I was. Maybe you’ll adapt, like some tenants do. Perhaps you’ll learn the rhythms of this building’s strange night life, find a way to coexist, even thrive.

Good luck. Truly.

—C.

I read the letter three times. With each reading, my heart pounded harder. The silence in the apartment pressed in. Outside, the old radiator hissed, and somewhere above me, something heavy scraped across a floor. I remembered last night: the faint knock at 2:20 a.m. I’d assumed it was a drunk neighbor, lost in the wrong corridor. I hadn’t answered. Now I realized that had been the right choice, though purely by luck.

A quiet whistle drifted through the door. My blood turned to ice. Just a few bars of some unfamiliar melody, and then silence again. I clenched the note in my hands so tightly the paper crumpled. The rules spun in my head. Don’t investigate. Just let it pass.

My phone buzzed. A text from my boyfriend, who was working late shifts across town. He joked about loving our new place, told me I should get some rest. But how could I sleep, knowing what I knew now?

The whistling started again. Longer this time, the tune winding through minor keys, almost mocking. I shut my eyes. It’s just a sound, I told myself, just a trick of acoustics in an old building.

The ceiling creaked overhead. The damp patch above my bed—would it be darker tonight, maybe tinged red like the note suggested? My mind conjured horrors I never would’ve imagined before moving here. I forced myself to breathe slowly, evenly.

The whistling stopped.

Then something scratched at my door, so light I almost missed it. I checked the time on my phone—2:14 a.m. Not yet the forbidden time. The note said after 2:17. Did I have time to turn out the lights, hide in bed? Or would acknowledging it now be as dangerous as acknowledging it later?

The handle rattled softly, a patient test. A faint voice followed—my boyfriend’s voice, calling my name. He was supposed to be at work, miles away. I knew better. I’d just gotten a text from him seconds ago. My real boyfriend wouldn’t be home for hours.

My heart hammered. Don’t let them in, the note had said. I turned off the lamp, crept back to my bedroom. The boards creaked under me, and outside, the voice whispered softly, “Please… please open up. It’s raining out here. I forgot my key.”

My phone glowed in my hand, screen lighting my trembling fingers. No new messages. I thought of calling the police, but what would I say? A stranger’s at my door, imitating my boyfriend’s voice. Rules about hairless cats and midnight elevators wouldn’t help my credibility.

Footsteps in the hallway. The handle fell silent.

Then came the humming. A melody that matched the whistling’s shape, but hummed deep and low, like a lullaby from a throat not made to sing. I clenched my jaw so tightly it hurt.

They want in. Don’t let them in.

I curled under the blankets, knife from the kitchen drawer in hand (the note never mentioned a weapon, but it felt right). I waited, stomach twisted in knots. The humming wavered, as if something pressed its ear to the door, listening for my breath, my heartbeat.

Eventually, it moved away. The silence returned, heavy and wrong. In that silence, I knew two things: I wouldn’t sleep a wink tonight, and I couldn’t leave. Leaving would mean crossing that hallway, waiting for the elevator, risking a glance at that metal reflection. It would mean daring the late-night world outside, full of shadows and unanswered questions.

So I stayed, eyes wide, mind racing. I tried to remember the exact melody of the whistling, how it began, if it ended on a note that promised resolution or discord. I couldn’t recall. At some point, I must’ve dozed off, because I woke to the pale light of dawn, heart still pounding, the note still crumpled in my hand.

I survived one night. Just one. The building stands quiet now, as if waiting to see what I’ll do next. There’s a subtle scrape in the wall behind my bed, and I think I hear the faint echo of laughter from upstairs. The letter said the first few weeks are the worst. I can’t imagine this lasting weeks, but I have no choice. I must learn. I must adapt.

Before I put down my phone, I glance at the note one last time, memorizing its rules. They might save me, or they might just prolong the inevitable.

And now I understand the previous tenant’s warning: once you know the truth, once the melodies and voices and knocks start, there’s no going back. This place has claimed many before me, and it’s patient. So patient.

They want in. I won’t let them.

I hope.
