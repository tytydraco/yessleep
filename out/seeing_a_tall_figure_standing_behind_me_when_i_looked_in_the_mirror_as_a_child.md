This is something I witnessed about 12 years ago as a child when i was about 10-11 y/o when i was still in our family's previous house that backed onto bushland on the out skirts of Sydney.

I once had to get up during the night to go to use the toilet, the closest toilet to my room was the in the bathroom attached to my parents bedroom.

just to set the image here's a description and laid out of our house: it was 2 story house and all the bedrooms were in the second story of the house, my room was closest to the stair case and my parents room was all the way at the other end of the hallway of the second story, their door looked down the length of the hallway and in my parents bedroom there was a big dresser that had a large mirror attached that faced the door and looked down the hallway when their door was open.

one night when i was walking down the hall way to use the bathroom my parents had their door open and when i got close to their bedroom door way i looked into the big mirror i just mentioned and i could see a tall dark figure standing behind me, when i saw it all i remember doing was sprinting as fast as i could and jumped into bed with my mum and dad and i was wide awake all night and struggled to sleep for the next few nights.

It had no fascial features or any detail at all, it was like a tall shadow was standing behind me. i know it wasn't my reflection, as i said i was 10-11 years old at that point so i would have been only a meter tall at the time and the thing that was behind me was about 6 foot/1.8m tall at a guess so it would have towered over me.

i have no clue what it was, knowing all the stories i know now the best way i can explain it is it looked the same as how people or depict shadow people, i don't want to jump to any conclusions or say it is shadow people just to sound clich√© or to make the story sound like a shadow people encounter because i hate when people use that term to try to make their story sound relevant and more mysterious but  thats the best way to explain what it looked like, it just looked like a tall all dark figure behind me. the house was dark at the time because we had no lights on so of course it did look completely dark

I don't know if it was something or it was just some sort of hallucination from just walking up but i have never had sleep paralysis or any type of hallucination so i can write that theory off.

that house always had a creepiness to it, it wasn't an old house but i always had a strange uneasy feeling as a child there that i never felt when sleeping over at friends houses or anyone else's houses, it was only at that address.

Im 23 now and to this day im slightly shy about looking into any mirrors during the night worried i might see it again

has anyone ever had a similar experience let me know as I do find it interesting

as creepy and mildly traumatising it was at the time as a child.



thank you!
