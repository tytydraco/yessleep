Hey, everyone. It's Bennett. Since I got such positive feedback on the last post, which I've linked above, I've decided to share a few more stories about some of my experiences from working for the NYC subway. Some of you asked me about specific things that have happened, and they actually made me recall some specific encounters I had, so I'll also be including those this time around. Like last time, feel free to ask any questions or add any comments below. I do read them.

One of you asked me if I had had any strange run-ins with the infamous New York rats. Obviously, the subway tunnels are absolutely infested with those little bastards. Typically, my relationship with the rats has always been one of mutual disregard. I don't like them, and they don't like me, and we don't acknowledge one another. It's not that I find them revolting. I just generally am not fond of them. Once you've seen a giant rat drag a Sicilian slice from one end of the tunnel to the other, you tend to lose your appetite.

However, I did remember one specific instance where a group of rats acted rather erratically. Those of you who live in New York City yourselves might know that there are marked difference between rats of different city districts. Brooklyn rats are distinct from rats in Queens or the Bronx, and even downtown Manhattan rats are pretty different from uptown Manhattan ones. One day on the job, I ran into a group of rats that didn't look *anything* like the ones from any of the five boroughs, however.

These rats were fat little things, with hindlegs that extended far beyond their tails. Their legs were bent upward in an unnatural fashion, appearing almost like a grasshopper's legs would. It was unnerving. Their fur was a stark white, tinged with a nauseating hue of yellow that made it look like each hair on the rats' bodies were beginning to decompose and fray at the ends. Their whiskers, too, ended in the same disgusting yellow. And their tails... they were this dark, bruised purple. It was as if they had earthworms crawling out from beneath them.

I ran into a small cluster of them while patrolling the subway one night. I had the night-to-morning shift, so there weren't terribly many people in the tunnel at the time. Obviously, there's *always* a few people hanging around the NYC subway, even if they aren't necessarily taking the train. That was the case that night; there were a few homeless people scattered around. Usually, they stick close to the columns and corners of the subway platforms if they're just there for change or food. Otherwise, they'll stand with the others and wait for the train.

Anyway, I ran into this cluster of weird ass rats, right? Things were nasty little buggers. Everyone else in the tunnel were a a few dozen feet away from them, at the least. It wasn't like they were straying away. I don't think anyone had actually noticed them. The rat-things were all gathered around something on the floor. Their wide, grasshopper haunches up, they were all gnawing on something in the center of their cluster. I figured it was a slice of pizza or some scrap of food left behind by one of the previous passengers.

I took my flashlight off my belt and made as if to shoo them away, but... they didn't immediately leave like other NYC rats would. Instead, they all froze *at once*. It was as if a singular collective command was spoken to them at the same time, and they all froze in exactly the same way at exactly the same time. Then, they all turned to face me. Their eyes were pale yellow, as if they were filled with a light noxious gas, and their teeth were *far* too long for their heads. Some of their incisors nearly met the ground, like a poor imitation of a rat-walrus hybrid.

They sat there for maybe five seconds before all scuttling off at once. They ran down the side of the tunnel onto the tracks, and that was the last I've ever seen of those kinds of rats.

When I looked down to see what they had been eating, I felt my blood turn to ice. It wasn't a slice of pizza at all. It was a human hand, half of it gnawed away to skeleton and sinew. Some flesh still clung in clumps to parts of it--the fingers were mostly untouched--but the rest was raggedy and torn.

I immediately called it in and the police arrived to check it out. They weren't able to find out when the hand had been torn from its body, but apparently it hadn't been long before I came across it. As far as I know, they never found a body and they never named a suspect. I'm honestly not sure if it had even *been* a person who did it. After all, whose to say what those rats were and weren't capable of? I'm not.

I also got a question from a u/leomonster about out-of-place stairs in the subway tunnels. While I've never heard anything about stairs that weren't supposed to be where they were, I have heard some weird stories about stairs leading to the wrong *place*.

I've never had this happen to me personally, but a few of my coworkers over the years have sworn up and down that they've walked down a set of stairs that was supposed to lead to their assigned station and somehow ended up in an entirely different section of the tunnels.

Take Joey, for instance. Joey is one of my closest friends and coworkers, having worked with me now for about 10 years. I love the guy, but if I'm being honest, Joey's kind of a piece of soggy bread. He's not really one for jokes and, as long as I've known the guy, he's always been pretty serious about his job.

Anyway, one day, Joey comes into work in this panicked state. He was late by nearly an hour and a half. I had *never* seen him as manic as I had that day. I asked him what was going on, and his response was almost entirely incomprehensible. It was just a string of nonsense with some occasional words sprinkled in. I told him to take a seat and calm down while I grabbed him a coffee. When I came back, he was significantly calmer and was able to actually speak real sentences, but he still looked freaked out. I asked him what was up, and this is what he told me.

According to Joey, he had been going through his daily routine like normal and was perfectly on time for his shift. At that time, we were assigned to a stop in lower Manhattan. As he started walking down the steps to our station, he noted that it was darker in the tunnel than usual. He couldn't actually see the bottom of the staircase from the top. As he kept walking, and as it kept growing darker, he realized that he should have reached the bottom ten or twenty steps ago. Then, the light from the surface vanished *completely*. Joey whipped around to see what had happened, and he was shocked to find that he couldn't see a *thing.*

Then, said Joey, he raced back up the steps. This is where his explanation gets a little hard to describe. Somehow, in that dark corridor where Joey couldn't see his own hand in front of his face, he went from running upstairs to running *downstairs.* All of a sudden, the light from the tunnel was illuminating the staircase again, and he had somehow reached the bottom.

Except he wasn't in the station he had started at. He was in a random stop in Brooklyn. And, even weirder, when he looked at his watch, nearly 20 minutes had passed by. Joey swore up and down that he had only been on that staircase for 2 minutes, tops.

Normally, if someone told me this kind of yarn, I'd think they were trying to pull one over on me. But Joey never jokes. That's what makes this one worth telling. He's not the kind of guy to pull pranks, and from the way he had looked when he came into work, he didn't *look* like he was joking.

A few other MTA workers and even some passengers have reported similar things over the years. Once or twice someone will walk down a set of stairs and end up one station over from the one they had entered, or at the station they had intended to take the train to in the first place, or just some completely random station. There's even been some talk of one woman walking down a flight and just never reappearing, but I can't confirm that one. Still, it's not something I would immediately discount.

Oh, I remembered another weird guy I see in the tunnels every once in a while. This guy has been around since well before I started working here, and he still shows up occasionally. I'm just gonna call him Guitar Guy.

Guitar Guy is just... well, he's interesting. I'll give you that. When I first saw him, I thought he was some sort of wannabe shock act that had wandered in from Times Square. He was wearing nothing but a pair of underwear and a guitar strapped onto his bare chest. He looked just like the Naked Cowboy, if you've ever seen him around the city, so I naturally assumed he was just some copycat looking to get attention. I moved to go over and kick the guy out, but then all of the other MTA workers stopped me and said that I should let him stay and play his song.

I thought they were pulling my leg, but I decided to stop and see what Guitar Guy was capable of. I'm glad I did, too. When he started strumming the strings of his instrument, the air around him seemed to sort of... shimmer. It was if God Himself had turned up the saturation and brightness of the very space Guitar Guy inhabited, because all of a sudden, this guy looked *beautiful*. It was like he walked right out of a Salvador Dali painting or something. Everyone around him--passengers, some homeless folks, and even a few of us workers--stopped what they were doing and looked at him, a sense of awe sketched onto their faces.

He sang a song, and it was just gorgeous. I wish I could describe what it was like, but I can't. Because I don't remember. I've heard his song some twenty or thirty times during my career, but I can't for the life of me ever recall it once I've heard it. All I know is that it sounds amazing, and that I always grow excited once I see him. I don't think I've ever seen him do anything other than walk in, play his guitar, and then leave. Never seen him talk. Never seen him get onto a train. Now that I think about it, he looks pretty much exactly like he did from the day I first saw him. It's like he doesn't even age. Ask anyone from MTA about Guitar Guy, and they'll probably just get a big old smile on their faces.

Finally, I did a little bit of digging on the guy in the bowler hat and big overcoat. You guys really seemed to want to hear more about him, so I headed over to the New York Public Library to look for anything that caught my eye. And what I found honestly shocked me.

I used the computer search near the front desk to find any matching texts to my description of the guy, but besides a few red herrings in some fictional novels, I wasn't able to find anything. Then, I headed over to the microfilm readers and asked a librarian for help looking through older New York newspapers.

I probably spent five whole hours scouring those papers, but I *found something*. Obviously, there were mentions of the guy and a description of what he was wearing from all of the recent instances that I mentioned. But I also found something that I don't think anyone else has.

I was looking over an old newspaper copy that was published March 3, 1957. I honestly can't even believe that I spotted this; it was so out of the way. The headline of the "weekend edition" of the New York Post read "Music Man Opens to Applause at Majestic Theatre," but I was far more intrigued on the front page sidebar, just a small snippet of an already obscure part of the paper:

**Mystery Man Pushes Child onto Subway Tracks, Causes Commotion**

"*On this day, at approximately 4:30 p.m., a mystery individual pushed 10-year-old Charlie Jones onto the tracks at the Times Square-42nd Street subway station. The individual was unfortunately not apprehended and has not yet been spotted by the authorities, but Jones did fortunately survive. Thanks in no small part to his quick thinking and reflexes, young Charlie grabbed the edge of the platform and lifted himself back up only moments before the oncoming train entered the station.*

\*When questioned about the man, who slipped away during the resulting commotion, Charlie could only say this: '\*He was really tall, and he had on a funny round hat. I didn't see his face. He was covering it with the part of his jacket that comes around his neck. It was a really long coat, too. I hope they can catch the guy. Honest, I'm real sorry that I couldn't catch his face.'

*If you have any information regarding this dangerous individual please be sure to contact...*"

The rest of the article went over the standard fare of the times. In fact, there wasn't any mention of him in the rest of the issue, or in any other papers that came out the same day. Trust me, I checked.

And then, I pored over all of the issues of that paper to come out in the next few months. Nothing. I asked the (rather frustrated) librarian if they could call me if they heard or saw anything in other papers after that date regarding the man. I haven't gotten any calls yet. It might be that the librarian just decided they had had enough and didn't do it. I guess that would be fair. Either way, I'll be back soon to look more at the papers.

That was *66 years ago*. 66 years, and then presumably nothing, and then boom! Back again. No explanation. No differences from before. I want to believe that it's a coincidence, or someone else following in the original's footsteps, but I'm not sure that's the case. Who else could have seen this besides me? I barely was able to find anything, and I was actually looking for it.

Anyway, that's all I have for now. I'll be back in a bit with some more stories. Again, if you have any questions or comments, leave them below. I'll try to respond to as many as I can. For now, seeya!
