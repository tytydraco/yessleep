Working full time in a hospital for seven years, I knew the familiar and unmistakable stench of blood. I had grown so used to it that I stopped giving it a second thought. But this time, it was different. The smell was far too strong, as if I was breathing it in far too closely.

I tried to open my eyes, realizing that I was not blindfolded. I squinted against the bright light emanating from the dangling tube lights overhead. My vision blurred for a second, and I thought I was hallucinating at what I saw next.

Strewn across the floor were around seven bodies, all of them in a grisly state. Mutilated. Some were so distorted and mangled, it was hard to make out their gender. Organs and body parts were everywhere. I saw three heads. One belonged to a woman with purple streaks in her hair. I recognized her instantly—an intern, evident from her uniform.

My mouth opened to scream, but no sound came out. I turned and ran toward the door, but my feet slipped on something wet, sending me crashing to the floor. Groaning, I pushed myself up and looked at what had caused me to fall.

Something small. Bloody. Shiny.

An earlobe.

This time, the scream came out. It tore through the silence, raw and animalistic, echoing through the cold, sterile walls of the hospital corridor. My hands trembled as I scrambled backward, trying to distance myself from the severed piece of flesh. The blood beneath me was thick and sticky, clinging to my palms as I pushed myself up. My stomach churned violently, and I fought back the urge to vomit.

This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real.

But the coppery scent of blood was undeniable, saturating the air so thickly that I felt like I was drowning in it. My head spun, my breaths came in short gasps, and my pulse hammered wildly against my ribs.

Then I noticed something else.

Footsteps.

Not my own.

Soft, deliberate, coming from the end of the hall.

I froze, my body going rigid. My mind screamed at me to run, but my legs refused to move. The footsteps grew closer, measured, unhurried—as if whoever was approaching had all the time in the world.

And then… the lights flickered.

The fluorescent glow above me buzzed and pulsed, casting eerie shadows that stretched unnaturally across the walls. The temperature seemed to drop, an icy chill creeping along my spine. My breath came out in short, shallow gasps as I turned my head toward the sound.

A figure stood at the far end of the hallway, partially obscured by darkness.

Tall.

Unmoving.

Watching.

The flickering lights gave me only glimpses—a face wrapped in something dark, features hidden beneath layers of stained fabric. Their hands, however, were unmistakable. Red. Dripping. Fingers twitching slightly, as if eager… waiting.

A deep, guttural whisper slithered through the silence, sending a violent shudder through me.

“Rosa.”

My name.

They knew my name.

The paralysis broke. I turned and ran, feet slipping on the blood-slick floor as I barreled toward the exit. My heartbeat pounded in my ears, drowning out all sound except for my own ragged breathing. The door was just ahead—

But as I reached for the handle, it wouldn’t budge.

Locked.

“No, no, no—” I gasped, yanking at it desperately. My sweaty fingers fumbled at the knob, clawing at the wood as panic swallowed me whole.

A sound behind me.

Not footsteps this time.

Breathing.

Slow. Heavy. Right at my ear.

I whirled around, but before I could react, something cold and slick wrapped around my throat. A hand. Fingers pressing into my windpipe, squeezing just enough to make my vision darken at the edges.

I tried to scream, but no sound came out.

The last thing I saw before the world faded to black…

Was a pair of gleaming eyes staring down at me. And a smile. A wide, jagged smile that didn’t belong to anything human.
