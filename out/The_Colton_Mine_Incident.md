It started with a rough voice being played through the low-quality speakers of a laptop. The voice is deep and gives the impression of someone trying to sound professional. In the background you can hear men talking as well as the faint screeching of heavy machinery.   
  
Sept 12th, 2024, 9:16 AM Foreman's log 1: The days started typically no incident. Rodgers of sick so Johns come in to cover. Mining on vein 1 and 2 continuing as planned however the boys at vein 1 have detected a large cavern with the seismic scanner due northwest 30 yards of the current tunnels. Plans have been sent to head office to blow open the northwest wall to explore the new cavern. Hopes are that it's a new vein but it's too soon to say. Will start a second log when the situation develops.   
  
Sept 12th,2024, 10:43AM Foremans log 2: Ok so permission has come through to blast the cavern open so we’re just waiting for the explosives to be rigged and then we’ll be ready to go. I'll make another log once we know what's inside. Personally, I hope it's nothing. This mine is overcrowded as it is, and I don't think a few hundred more miners coming from all over to work on a new vein would help. Anyway, I'll try and be more optimistic the men sure are. More minerals in this mine means one thing and that's plenty of overtime. I'll start another log when we’ve set of the charges.   
  
In the background of the recording men can be heard talking excitedly as heavy crates are dragged across jagged stone floors. The heavy machinery that was heard in the previous recording had stopped and was replaced with frequent radio chatter and occasional static.   
  
The third recording started differently to the last, all that could be heard was heavy breathing and the faint calls of men in the background. Then the same rough voice speaks once again.   
  
“d..dear god....wha..t have we done. It s..sounded so human”   
  
The audio recording ends, and the screen of the laptop went black. Silence fell on the room as everyone collectively tried to comprehend what they had just heard. People began to fidget uncomfortably in their chairs and some people looked rather pale all except for three men who stood at the back of the room. They had deadpan expressions on their face and their arms were folded. The awful silence was broken by a stern voice that came from a woman standing behind the now closed laptop. She stood with a straight posture and addressed the room.   
  
“That final audio recording was taken a few hours ago at 1:02 PM and was the last sign of contact that was had with the miners. Since then, they haven't answered their radios and no SOS pings have been sent out. Since that recording it's been total radio silence. Initially we assumed a cave in however the entrance tunnel is intact, and the mine elevator is in working order also again no SOS pings. So, you're here, company executives, off duty miners and search and rescue specialists to figure out what's happening and how to rescue the men trapped down there. Are we all clear”   
  
The room nodded in nervous agreement   
  
“Right the time is currently 2:11 PM so we only have a few days before food and water will run out, so we need to act quickly. What are our thoughts on what could be happening”    
  
There was a temporary silence until a man's voice spoke out.    
  
“The mine might be flooded. That cavern that was spoken about in the audio logs could have been connected to a lake or a stream. Mabey when the charges went off water rushed in and flooded the mine. If that were the case, then...” He trailed off but the implication was clear.   
  
Another voice spoke out in protest to this theory. The voice was smooth and belonged to a well-dressed man in a grey suit.   
  
“What a load of rubbish. If that were the case the central elevator wouldn't work, would it. Also” He continued but as he did a clear uneasiness came over him “Also the final audio recording showed that the Foreman was still alive after the detonation.”   
  
“What did he mean when he said it sounded so human” A voice called out in a somewhat frightened voice.   
  
At this a flurry of people began to ask questions nervously. The talking was frantic, multiple conservations were happening all at once.    
  
“Listen we need to cooperate if...”   
  
She was cut off by the man in the grey suit   
  
“I'm sorry” He said in an unconvincing and condescending tone “But who put you in charge. If I remember correctly, it's our mine and those miners are our responsibility” As he said this, he indicated to the other people wearing suits that were sat together on metal chairs in centre of the room. Around them were worn, rough looking men who were wearing grey overalls and blue jeans.   
  
“My name is DSI Clara Barkley and search, and rescue co-ordination falls under the jurisdiction of Northumbria police so if you don't mind, I'm in charge” There was a cold loathing in her voice that wasn't to be reconned with. “John what's the situation regarding the power to the mine? Does the central lift work?”   
  
At this point I had just been sitting in the corner of the room on my laptop. The question caught me off guard for a second, but I soon said.   
  
“All good gaff powers just fine, lifts are working but the lights are off. They were turned off manually at 1:12 PM nothin I can do about it without access to the mine's breaker box.”   
  
At this final remark one of the three men who had been standing at the back of the room spoke for the first time. His voice was low and matched his tall unshaven appearance.   
  
“Why would they turn of the lights?”   
  
The room went cold. The question expressed what everyone was thinking. Why would miners trapped in a mine willingly shut of their only source of light. No reply was given to the question, so the man spoke again.   
  
“How many miners were working?”   
  
This question took people's minds from the troubling detail and was answered promptly.   
  
“Quite a f..few” The young man who had just spoken was skinny with a nervous completion. Judging by his jeans and outward appearance it seemed clear that he was a miner. This detail wasn't lost on the man at the back of the room who then asked.   
  
“How well do you know these mines. Very?” The miner nodded quickly. “Good then you'll be coming with us. You” He pointed at the man who had suggested that the mine could have been flooded. "What do you do?”   
  
The man having expected the question responded promptly.   
  
“My names Arthur, I'm a rescue caver and part time paramedic I also...”   
  
“That’ll do. With your permission gov I’d like to take these two” He indicated at Arthur and the miner who were both still seated “and my two” He then indicated to the two men at the back of the room who were still standing solemn faced and unmoved “into the mines and do some basic recon and we’ll radio in what we see.”   
  
“Very well. Anything you need, just ask.”   
  
The man nodded and without words he and the other two men left the building with Arthur and the miner following suit.   
  
Sept 12th, 2024, 2:59 PM Captain Thatcher: “Have we got coms yeah? Alright, this is Captain Thatcher speaking, we are about to head into Colton mine through the central elevator. Smith's stayin behind to ensure we don't lose signal so it's just Me, Umber, Arthur Wells a local Paramedic and some minor kid called Rodger Caine. The time is 2:59 PM I’ll keep in contact to the best of my abilities, but I need to be focused so expect some long pauses. We ready? Ok. Team follow my lead and don't deviate from the path, if you fall behind call and we’ll all stop. We stick together. The goal is to move in see what's happening and turn the lights on. We clear?”   
  
Clara watched from the window of the small building as the team of four walked into the entrance tunnel. It was large and reinforced with long wooden and steel beams. The word “Colton” was written in large golden letters above the entrance and before long the men were out of sight. She turned around and joined the group of people who were huddled around a metal table that was covered with radio equipment operated by a gaunt looking man who had previously stood at the back of the room.   
  
On the laptop Infront of me I saw that the lift had just been set into motion and I said as much to the rest of the room. I was then met with a snappy.   
  
“Keep us updated and tell us when they get the lights on” From Clara   
  
I can't really remember what I said, probably something stupid like “Aye will do gaff.”   
  
At this moment the radio on the table received a message from team.   
  
“Just reached the mine, its fucking dark. Flashlights aren't doing a thing. Movement will be slow. Will radio back when I've got something to say Thatcher over”   
  
The man operating the radio replied “Rodger that boss awaiting your call. How's connection? Smith over”   
  
“Decent, over”   
  
There was silence as the radio communications ended. The room that they were in was a small brick building that was on the edge of a clearing in a thick forest. The building was typically used as both a communication hub and a meeting spot for the miners as it was situated only a few hundred feet from the entrance to the mine.   
  
The silence persisted. As it went on it grew unbearable. Nervous fidgeting began to set in as the room sat around the radio waiting for a response. Some people unable to bear this excruciating silence went outside while others kept asking the man operating the radio whether it wouldn't be wise to try contacting the team, but whenever it was asked the operator, Smith would always respond with the same “If he has something to say he report back” This response worked for a time to satisfy the unrest but soon it grew infuriating and the general unrest became anger and before long people were in a riotous mood with people demanding that the radio be used and just as the tension reached a pitch the radio lit up and Thatcher's voice could be heard.   
  
“Ok so we’ve gone pretty deep in and have made it to a transformer looking thing, how do I get the lights on? Over"   
  
This again took me of guard. I was not paying attention to the job at all. I was probably still cringing at the fact that I called my boss gaff Infront of the whole fucking room. But eventually I comprehended what he asked and I said.   
  
“Right describe to me exactly what you see Infront of you o..over”   
  
“It's a big white box with cables coming out of it. There's a panel covered in buttons and a rubber lever thing. Over"   
  
I then probably went on to describe how to reset a transformer which basically equates to turning it off and on again. When I was done there was a temporary silence then my laptop pinged.   
  
“Ok the lights are on, cheers mate. Right, we’ll continue to explore but so sign of any miners so far but as I said you couldn't see shit in here, the lights will help. Everyone's ok so far if not a bit unnerved. For a mine there aren't many miners. Thatcher ov...”   
  
The transmission had ended abruptly which had taken the room by surprise. After all the hysterics of earlier they had learned not to overreact to details such as long silences and they shouldn't be worried about this as well. Initially this was the thinking, and it was helped by the calm and collected nature of the radio operator who had been correct previously. However as before this detail festered at the back of people's mind. However, unlike last time people restrained themselves waited patiently for the next response and it came much sooner than expected. After only a few minutes the radio lit up and an unnerved voice began to speak.   
  
“Something terribles happened down here. I can't figure it out though. Nothings objectively wrong with it but...” He trailed off in frustration “I can't describe it. It's just off” It was clear by his voice that he was frustrated at his inability to convey the uneasy feelings that he had.  “Ok right, we’ve just left tunnel 12 and we are in an open bit. In the corner there is a small office that I'm told it used to be the foremen's. The door is intact, the desk inside is neatly organised hell even the football posters on the wall are fine, but it's just deserted. I don't know I think that the emptiness is getting to me. We are going to head to the central lift and head back up. We haven't seen any signs of the miners. They must be deeper in the mine. If we want to find them then we need a plan and proper search equipment. Thatcher out”   
  
The crowd gathered around the radio looked at each other worryingly. Fantastic thoughts were swirling through their heads as to what could have been the cause of all of these miners' disappearances. By now the team had been in the mine for a few hours and the time was now 4:02 PM and by quarter past the team had risen out of the mine and were back in the stuffy room. They received a hearty welcome when they returned though it was clear by the look on their faces that they were disappointed that they hadn't found any sign of life and somewhat shaken by the experience. Despite this they were committed return tomorrow with better gear and a proper plan. By now TVs had been set up showing live feeds of the surveillance cameras that were in the mine. Cam 1 showed the central mines elevator. Cam 2 showed the main passageway from which the path split to vein 1 and vein 2 while Cam 3 showed the open area where the Foremans office lay. However, everyone on in the room was huddled around a map of the mine discussing where the miners could be. The live feeds were completely unattended when just for a moment something fast moved from one of the passageways in Cam 3 and into the Foremans office.    
  
Come the morrow the air was damp. It had rained the night before, but this hadn't deterred anyone, now more than ever the people in that small stuffy brick room were determined to find the miners. The plan that had been made yesterday evening was for the same team to head into the bowels of the mines with proper safety equipment and find the miners. Each of them was given high visibility vests, industrial strength flashlights and radios.    
  
The time was 8:12 AM and at 20 past the team was set to head back into the mine, however before they did so Umber, the third man pulled Thatcher aside and they spoke in a hushed voice. After a short conversation Umber left the building and entered a black van that had been parked outside. He re-entered a few minutes later and said nothing.   
  
DSI Clara Barkley was talking to a small group of worried looking people in the centre of the room. They were the families and loved ones of the lost miners. They all looked distressed, and it was clear by the looks on many of their faces that they had been crying. At this moment Smith the sullen radio operator walked up alongside the group of people.   
  
“Ma’am, are we ready to send in the search party”   
  
“Yes, right away.”   
  
At this Smith turned around and made a signal with his hand. The search team grabbed their bags and left the building. By now it was 8:19 AM and the team was ready to enter once more. So once again they walked forwards into the darkness and once again everyone in the small brick building gathered around the radio operator as the team descended. They watched through the TVs as the team stepped off the elevator and began to walk deeper. They moved a lot faster now as with the lights being on as well as their powerful flashlights, they weren't worried about walking into machinery or falling into mineshafts.    
  
Over the radio Thatcher's low voice said    
  
“Alright we’re at a split in the mine and we’re going down the left path to vein 2. Will radio in if the situation changes. over.”    
  
Sure, enough on cam 2 the team was seen to head left down into vein 2. All was going smoothly, team was making good progress, in 25 minuets they had nearly reached the deepest part of the mine. However, at 8:56 AM a message came through the radio from a different frequency. It was the low voice of Thatcher.   
  
 “Right, we’ve reached the bottom of the mine. We found the miners. More men will be needed to get them out.”   
  
“Rodger that Thatcher what condition are they in? Over”   
  
There was silence over the radio until a different voice came over the radio. It was a softer voice, and it was unmistakably Arthurs.   
  
“Ok so we have reached a stoppage. There's a locked door that Thatcher's trying to jimmy open it might take a while. Urhh over”   
  
“The miners what condition are the miners in over!” Smith sounded concerned. There was a trace of suspicion in his voice.   
  
“Miners? Oh yeah, the miners. We still haven't found them, but we are hoping that they are beyond this door. Over"   
  
“Arthur, get Thatcher on the radio. Over"   
  
Rustling was heard on the over the radio as it was handed over to Thatcher.   
  
“Yeah, what is it? Over”   
  
“You just radioed me. You said that you’d found the miners so what condition are they in? Over !!!.   
  
“What are you talking about. No one's radioed you. Over"   
  
Smith looked confused. He looked around the room for confirmation. He gestured towards the radio equipment and mouthed the words “You heard it right” The room nodded in nervous agreement.   
  
“Make sure that you're on channel 11. Over.”   
  
Smith sat back in his chair and looked blankly at the radio. There was a long pause before the next radio transmission. It was from Thatcher.   
  
“We got the door open and have continued to descend. We’re not far from the bottom now, should be there in the next 10 minuets. Over"   
  
“Rodger that” Smith said in a slightly supressed voice.   
  
Following this exchange there were a few minutes of silence as the radio team waited for more news. Then the silence was broken by the jittery voice of Rodger. He was speaking in a hushed voice and sounded frightened.   
  
“I d..don't think we can trust these men. They bought guns with them. Umber pulled them from his bag a few minutes in. Me and Arthur are too scared to protest. Search and rescue missions don't need sub machine guns.”   
  
In the background the voices of Thatcher and Arthur could be heard talking. The transmission ended suddenly.   
  
Smith's back straightened as he readied for the questions that he was going to be asked. The first to break the silence was the man in the grey suit who asked coolly.   
  
“Who is it exactly that you work for again”   
  
“Thatcher, Umber and I work for the special operations unit of the royal marines. When we heard of the situation, we volunteered to help. Now I want to make it clear that I didn't know that Umber had bought weapons into the mine.”   
  
The next to inquire was DSI Barkley who asked.   
  
“Why would he want to bring guns with him on a rescue mission”   
  
Smith sighed and stared blankly at the radio.    
  
“I have no idea, as I said this is the first I'm hearing of it but” He paused “It. It sounds like something that he’d do”   
  
The room fell silent. For the most part the other people in the room were satisfied with his response.    
  
The radio on the table crackled to life and Thatcher's voice could be heard.    
  
“We’ve made it to the bottom of the mine. The miners are here. We need more men to get them out. Send in another team. At least thirty men.”   
  
“Urr right what condition are the miners in. Over" There were notes of unease in Smiths voice as he said this.   
  
“Miners are trapped. We need more people. Send down more people.”   
  
“Thatcher, I want you to tell me what condition the men are in. Over” Smith sounded resolute, and his voice was firm.   
  
A sharp silence filled the room as there was no response over the radio. This standoff persisted for a few minutes until DSI Barkley cut the tension.    
  
“Is he ok?”   
  
Smith didn't respond. The radio crackled to life once more and Thatcher's low voice spoke over the radio. He sounded frantic. It was clear that he had been shaken by something. He was breathing heavily.   
  
“There's nothing left of them. We reached the bottom of the mine and t.they were everywhere. Torn to bits. We are leaving. Somethings down here with us. The lights have gone out, everyone's...”   
  
He was cut off by the sound of fully automatic gunfire. An unholy screech was heard in the background. The transmission ended but the radio remained illuminated. Then the cool low voice of Thatcher spoke over the radio.   
  
“Where are the men. The miners are calling out in pain. We can't help them alone we need more men. MORE FLESH, MORE FOOD. WHERE ARE THEY !!!”   
  
The voice of Thatcher screaming into the radio filled the small brick room with the horrible noise. Smith was now sat bolt upright with his hand gripping the arm of his chair. There was silence. Nothing was heard. Smith spoke for the final time into the radio, his voice was weak, and he sounded disturbed.   
  
“Thatcher. Mate, do you hear me.”   
  
The silence was telling. Smith slumped back in his chair. He held his head in his hands and said nothing.    
  
For the rest of the day nothing was heard through the radio. Others tried to reach the team but were met with no reply. Since then, nothing has been heard from the Colton mine system. No one has been permitted to enter the mine and the incident was written off as a chemical leak that asphyxiated the miners killing them immediately. The rescue team were never mentioned in the official report, to the families of the five men three different stories were told. The off-duty miner was said to have been in the mine come the chemical leak whilst the three royal marines were said to be KIA. As for the paramedic Arthur he was just another missing person destined to be a forgotten file at the bottom of a dusty, coffee-stained filling cabinet. The mines entrance was blocked off in the months following the incident. Everyone just forgot about the event and went on like it never happened. But I didn't. I was technician working under DSI Clara Barkley. I didn't do much, I helped get the lights on but apart from that I was just an observer but what happened in that mine was far different from what they said happened in the public report. I can't stand by while they lie to the world. This is my account of the true events that happened in Colton mine on September 12th, 2024.
