( This is a project I've been working on for a couple of years. Are you a fan of realistic psychological horror stories about experiments on the human mind? Wondering how strong a man's will to live is? What it takes to corrupt a man's mind? How much is a man willing to sacrifice for knowledge? )






It's been 3 years. 3 years since I escaped this hell. I thought I was saved but it's still after me, it somehow got inside my head, the whisper is getting louder day by day. I must hide. I must warn you about this place, it has to stay sealed forever. No one must ever go there. Consider the following story as a warning…

PART 1) Preparing.

Me and my cousin have always been fans of urban exploring. Since we were kids we used to explore every abandoned house we came across in our city. Places frozen in time with hidden treasures waiting to be found. It felt as if each one was unique in its own way, having its own story.

Growing up we moved to the next level. Exploring abandoned factories, hospitals, hotels, water parks and military bases. We encountered many weirdos, drug addicts and all kinds of dangerous People. We weren't really scared, no matter how dark or creepy the place was, we're both strong physically and mentally and trust each other with our lives.

We even had a YouTube channel documenting our adventures and it was going rather well. We would often collaborate with other urban explorers and visit dangerous places together. We were truly having the time of our lives.

But well… all that belongs to the past… after what happened to our last trip. I decided to delete all of the video and never get into this shit again. Consider the following story as a warning.

As i mentioned we had this discord server dedicated to Urban exploring. It was last winter when an unknown user named Miller, informed us about an abandoned military facility, a laboratory located inside a forest near his village. He mentioned it's only known to the locals and no one ever bothered to go in there.

For obvious reasons I'll keep the location a secret. I don't want anyone finding this place again. This underground hell must be kept sealed forever.

We decided to get in touch with this “Miller”. He gave me his phone number and we quickly got in touch, he seemed like a big fan. He talked pretty formally for someone living in a small village but there was something weird in his voice. I don't know how to describe it but I felt a bit weird.

We spent half an hour planning this trip since he was living a couple of hours away from us.

He agreed to host us for a night or two at his house. 

The next day we packed our equipment and  after a tiring amount of driving we reached the village around 11pm. It was an old traditional village. Houses made out of stone and wood, spreaded around a flat field with hills and mountains visible in every direction you looked at. There was dead silence by the time we arrived and only a few street lamps seemed to be working. 

We parked our car right Infront of Miller's house, took a deep breath, smiled and knocked the door. A man around his 40s welcomed us. His house looked old, but old in a good way. Most furniture was made out of wood. There were logs visible inside the house, holding it together.

Miller gave us a tour of the house, then we unpacked our equipment and we all gathered at the living room. There were two small couches, a brown carved wooden table in the middle and a big fireplace. We sat there, drank some tea and ate some amazing boar ribs.

-so Miller. Do you have kids? I asked while taking a bite.
-no, i never got married, i never had time.

Miller looked like a very intelligent person, there was a big library in his bedroom with biology and medical books, human and animal anatomy, the functionality of the brain and more.
There were also many random books laying around the house. Some with extinguished candles next to them. Others had notes on them.

We continued talking about our personal lives and hobbies. As I guessed Miller was a biologist with loads of medical knowledge too.
He used to live in a big city but moved to the countryside to find peace. Since then he's been living here on his own studying the local wildlife.

At this point it was getting very late. Miller went to his bedroom as we were getting ready to go to sleep.

“What do you think of him?” I asked my cousin
“He's chill, living by the nature, enjoying life”
“Yeah I guess so”
“Lets go to sleep, we've got a lot of walking tomorrow”

By that time there was a light rain outside and thin fog had covered the village's streets.

I woke up in the middle of the night from a sound. The noise was coming outside the house and it sounded like a fading scream. A deep distorted voice of a man screaming in pain and slowly disappearing.

While still sleepy I got up and walked to a nearby window to take a look. For a fraction of a second I saw… or I think I saw a humanlike figure running across the dirt path into the forest. It was skinny with some strange bulges.

I shook my head and looked closer again but there were no signs of movement. A wolf maybe? We're near a forest after all. I've gone camping before and I've got to admit these animals make some really weird noises. Have you ever heard them crying?

Without giving it much thought, I turned the other way and headed back to get some more sleep.

We've got a lot of walking tomorrow…
