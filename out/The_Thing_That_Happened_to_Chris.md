I never met my cousin Chris. 

The family didn’t talk about him much, and the only memories I have of him are through dusty, candid photos on my aunt’s walls and posed Christmas and Easter pictures that mark my grandparents' halls and mantel. 

He disappeared when I was three, gone in the night, leaving remnants of a boy in my aunt’s solemn house. 

During Christmas, my mom told my aunt about my newfound interest in VHS and camcorders. When Mom told her, Aunt Janelle's eyes went misty and nostalgic, and I realized that what I first thought was a touch too much eggnog was a shared interest with my cousin.

“Chris loved filming when he was your age,” she’d said, voice choked up with emotion. “Your Uncle Don and I got a camcorder one year, and, *God,* he and his friends, they filmed everything.” Her head was shaking as she went on, talking about all the bike tricks and attempted parkour and other pre-teen buffoonery captured forever by Chris and his friends. 

When she’d called Mom today, I expected the usual neighborhood gossip and middle-aged shit talk, but Aunt Janelle said she’d found Chris’s camera. She asked if I wanted to come and see the videos, to get to know my unknown cousin in a way I hadn’t before. 

She left me with the boxes in their basement, and I settled in front of the couch as the first clip played. 

The usual still form of my cousin takes up the old TV. He’s smiling, laughing at something his filming friend had said before the camera rolled. The next few minutes are Chris and his friends goofing around; shoving each other, attempting skateboarding tricks, lighting firecrackers. The four of them are thirteen or fourteen, and it’s easy to see the similarities between them and my group of friends. 

The next few hours pass in a blur of clips. It’s almost addictive, watching my cousin and his friends  — Jay, Alex, and Marcus — do stupid things together in the concrete monotony of my town’s bridges and underpasses. One tape, labeled 13/11/98, opens on a different scene. 

Instead of a tunnel, a road, or even someone’s yard, it’s the woods. 

The camera quality makes the probably golden woods look yellow, and the shadows of trees long and foreboding. For a few seconds, it’s only a pair of worn sneakers pushing through piles of dead leaves. 

“Jay, you dick!” Is the first audible thing over white noise and the crunching of leaves underfoot. The camera flicks upwards just in time to see Chris shove Jay into a pile of leaves. Jay gets up and shoves back, and they start to wrestle as Alex’s voice cuts in. 

“Guys, come on,” Alex says from behind the camera. “Stop it, we have to get there before dark.” 

Chris and Jay separate, laughing as they both shake leaves off their jackets. There are a few more minutes of quiet hiking inter-cut with jokes before the trees thin out and the camera focuses on the old quarry. 

It pans across the gash in the land, the sun painting the walls as the lowest parts darken. It’s silent for a moment before Jay speaks again. 

“...nice hole in the ground. Top 10, honestly.”

The camera flicks toward him as Jay snags a rock from the ground and hurls it into the quarry’s depths. The camera tracks the stone as it falls, static taking over the view as the zoom feature loses focus of the rock. 

The static ends, and Chris and Jay’s banter takes over the audio. They’re jokingly shoving each other closer to the edge before more rocks fall into the quarry's shady bottom. 

The next few minutes are just the four of them fucking around, climbing trees and wrestling around as the surrounding woods grow darker and darker. They throw more rocks, but instead of fading into the darkness, the rocks fall until abruptly blinking out into the blackness of the quarry like shooting stars. Despite the fuzzing audio and footage, the clip is fun to watch; it’s easy to imagine myself alongside them, throwing rocks around and goofing off. 

It’s dusk when someone suggests heading back, the dying sun turning everything more sinister and alien as it lengthens shadows. The video’s already bad quality seems poorer in the dark, every shadow swimming with dark, snowy spots. More joking ensues as they turn, the trees thickening again as the woods consume the camera's view. 

More walking and talking. 

“I *swear*, Dana’s been coming onto me all week!” Jay says. Alex is filming him from behind, taking in Jay and Chris’ backs as they walk. 

“Sure she has,” Chris says dryly. “Just like Emily is in science.”

“It’s not my fault, all the ladies want a piece of the—” 

White noise obscures the audio for a moment, and dancing static overtakes the TV screen. 

“—and the—”

“—how the—?”

The static slowly fizzles out, and when the camera’s view clears, it’s on Marcus instead of Chris and Jay. He’s looking around the darkened trees, head moving in rapid motions like a bird. He slowly turns back to the group, squinting against a flashlight's beam as someone behind the camera turns one on. 

“Did you hear that?” Marcus asks. 

“Hear what?” Chris says. “I think it was wind, dude.” 

“No,” Marcus says quickly, whirling back around, “it was like…”

Marcus's voice fades off as he goes almost unnaturally still. 

“Like what?” Jay asks. 

Marcus doesn’t respond. 

“Marcus, what did it sound like?” Jay asks. Leaves crunch as Jay walks closer, gripping Marcus's arm to turn him around. “Did it sound like your mom when I—”

Jay goes silent as he turns Marcus back around. Marcus's eyes are wide and unfocused; blood that looks vividly red even in the washed-out view of the camera drips from his nose, slowly welling up over his upper lip. 

Marcus gasps suddenly, his eyes fluttering against the flashlight's harsh white beam. His eyes flick around, first to Jay, then to the flashlight, then he stares directly into the camera. The blood from his nose drips down his lip, and his thousand-yard stare feels like it's boring into me. An icy shiver runs down my spine at the sight, and Marcus’s eyes stare unblinkingly at *me*.

“...what?” Marcus asks slowly. 

“How’s it going?” comes from behind me, and I spin around with a flinch. 

Aunt Janelle is smiling widely, holding a plate of pizza rolls. 

“Um, good,” I say after a second. “It’s going good. It’s pretty fun, seeing what they did.” 

Aunt Janelle hums happily and sets the plate on the table behind me. “Oh yeah, my Chris and his friends were great, best boys I knew.”

Her eyes go misty again as she stands, the dying light of the sun outside highlighting her greying hair. She stills for a moment, looking down. 

“They were something,” she murmurs. Her eyes move onto me again, and she smiles a little. “Well,” she says, “I’ll leave you to it.”

The closing of the basement door signals her exit, and when I turn again, Marcus's thousand-yard stare almost takes me by surprise. I resume the clip and settle back down, the scorching cheese of the pizza rolls sticking to the roof of my mouth.

“...what?” Marcus asks again.

“Are you okay?” Chris asks from behind the camera.

“Yeah, you got all weird, dude,” Jay says. 

Marcus nods, wiping at the blood from his nose like it’s a second thought as he turns and resumes walking. 

“Yeah,” he says faintly, “yeah.”

“Well, what did it sound like?” Alex asks, the camera shaking as he jogs after Marcus. 

“What?”

“That noise,” Alex says.

“What?” Marcus repeats. 

“The *noise!”* Jay yells, more leaves crunching as he runs towards Marcus. “You said it sounded like something, then you got all *weird—*”

The clip's audio goes fuzzy for a moment, and the visual quickly follows. The visuals return, and the camera shakes as Alex turns around. 

“—what—?”

Static overtakes Alex’s words as the camera turns to Chris. He’s also looking around, the flashlight in his hands flickering and sending sporadic bursts of light at trees and the ground. The audio clarity sharply returns right as Jay yells, but the view continues to shake as Alex rapidly moves. 

“What the *fuck—”*

The camera spins, trees and the greyness of the woods blurring past before it abruptly stops. 

It’s on the ground now, at an angle as it leans against a rock or something. Dirt smudges the lens, and the dark woods cause part of the image to look static and swimming; however, my cousin and his friends appear somewhat clearer.

Jay is shoving Marcus back, but instead of friendly and teasing, it’s harsh and angry. 

“Did you fucking grab me!?” Jay yells, Marcus spilling to the ground as Jay pushes him again. 

“Chill out!” Chris yells, running into frame and pulling Jay back. Alex’s boot enters the frame’s edge as he moves forward, stopping short of the other three. 

“He was grabbing at me and shit!” Jay yells, shoving Chris off. “Seriously, what the fuck—”

“—guys—” Alex’s voice cuts in, but Jay interrupts it. 

“—stop being all weird—”

*“—guys—”*

“—fucking *what*—?”

“Did you hear that?” Alex’s voice is quiet and hesitant as he turns to look at Jay, Chris, and the now standing Marcus. 

“...hear what?” Chris asks. 

“Like someone running,” Alex whispers harshly. “Like not one of us.” 

They descend into hurried whispers, Jay looking frustrated as Alex and Chris get closer and quieter, and Marcus looking around hesitantly. 

They separate with a sigh from Chris as he walks out of ‌view, coming back with the flashlight that’s still weakly flickering. Alex picks up the camera, staring into the lens and carefully wiping the dirt with his sleeve. Jay and Marcus are whispering over Alex’s shoulder as he messes with the camcorder. The unfocused woods behind them are still static and bubbling. 

Jay scratches at his chin as they talk, eyes rolling as Alex’s magnified eyes peer into the camera and me. 

Alex spins suddenly, the camera jolting as he turns to look into the woods behind him, and the view erupts into static. The movement makes me jump, and I blink rapidly, trying to calm back down. Rewinding the clip a few seconds, it looks like Alex turns to nothing, only Jay and Marcus arguing. 

I slow the clip, locked on the dark, distorted woods as they move in slow motion. A slow, grey movement peeks out among the trees, but it honestly looks like the camera is just picking up movement in the trees.

By the time the static ends, they’ve resumed walking. The camera, now with shitty night vision on, is angled on Alex’s feet as he walks, trudging through piles of leaves and debris. No one is talking now. 

The camera twitches up a bit, showing Chris and his flashlight leading the pack. Someone mumbles something, Jay, maybe, and he’s quickly shushed. 

Suddenly, they pause. The camera flicks up, showing Marcus looking into the trees behind them, white and green and ghostly in the night vision. Wind ruffles his hair, and Chris’s flashlight highlights his face as he turns, whispering: 

“*Run.*”

Then it’s just leaves and the ground and static. The camera swings every time Alex moves his arm, showing the upside-down woods, black now, interspersed with distorted grey. The audio goes into static, then the view too. 

“—keep go—”

Then; 

“—who—”

Then; 

“—*what*—”

More distorted noise. There’s a high, sharp noise, then a brief view of something grey and long, and then a slam. 

The camera slowly focuses again, and Chris is locking a door, the sliding glass door in the kitchen that leads into Aunt Janelle’s backyard. The night vision is almost blinding in the kitchen's light, highlighting Chris’ dirty knees and wide, rolling eyes. 

“What the fuck!” he says. “What the—how—*Marcus*—”

“Downstairs, downstairs now—” Jay yells, and the camera turns down again, and they stumble down the basement stairs. The door slams, and it sounds nearly like it’s happening *now.* Like if I were to turn around, I could see my cousin and his friends sprinting down the stairs. 

A noise snaps me out of the trance that the video put me in. The room is dark now, darker than it seems like it should be for this time at night. The only thing giving light is the green-white glow of the night vision on the TV. Another noise from the TV ropes me back in. 

Jay and Chris are crouching beside the couch, heads snapping around to look at the windows. Glancing over my shoulder, I can see where they’d be, right between the couch and the bookshelf. 

Marcus is nowhere to be seen. 

The night-vision is off, and the only noises are the creaks of the house, their panting breaths, and the quiet popping of static. 

“...what did it do to Marcus?” Alex asks, his voice a rasp behind the camera. 

“I dunno.” Chris mumbles. “The flashlight stopped, and he—”

“It grabbed him.” Jay breathes. “Do you think it followed? Did you close the gate?” 

The hair on the back of my neck prickles, my breathing speeding up to match theirs. The high noise might’ve been Marcus’ scream, but what is *it*?

There’s a thud over the video, drawing my attention back. Chris’s neck snaps around to look at the window above the TV; the camera follows. More bubbling, static-filled darkness, then, a slow blur of grey. 

Someone gasps, someone swears, and the camera falls again. It’s quickly picked up and refocused on the window. 

“It’s—”

“No,” Chris says, “no.” 

Silence flows through the speakers, the popping of static accompanying it. 

A light flicks on outside the window just as the light in the basement flicks off. It illuminated the top of the TV, then the rug, then the tips of Alex’s sneakers and Chris’s legs. It slowly gets brighter, then lights up like the sun, bathing everything in the video in a cold light. 

Someone screams, and Alex frantically scoots backwards, dropping the camera as Chris grabs a bat and approaches the window. He’s yelling, but static overtakes the audio as the light abruptly flicks off. 

A shaking flashlight beam turns on, skating over the couch and slowly up Chris’s back. 

It’s quaking as it slowly climbs the wall and hits the window. It glints off the glass, blinding the camera. 

“...a car?” Alex mumbles. 

“...maybe—” 

A massive grey face takes up the window, big, black, blank eyes sitting in its oval skull as a greasy palm slams into the window. The camera falls again, and I jolt back as the TV abruptly turns off. 

The house is unnaturally still. No Aunt Janelle upstairs, not even the rattle of pipes in the walls. 

My panting breaths seem like an intrusion, too loud and unnatural. 

I stand on shaking legs, looking around the dark room at the alien bumps of furniture. 

Slowly turning, nothing is out of the ordinary. The room is silent. 

A slow exhale leaves me, and I turn back to the TV.

In the window above it, a greasy, three-fingered handprint is pressed against the glass.

The TV turns back on, showing a crooked view of the empty basement as a white light outside flicks on through the window.
