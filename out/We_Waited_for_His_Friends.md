There’s a kind of silence you only find out here you know the type, flatland silence. Heavy. Wide. The kind that doesn’t end, just settles around you like dust.

I’ve been working the 'site' going on five years now. Middle of nowhere, out past the grain elevators that haven’t seen a train since before I was born. One building. One fence. No signage. Just a rusting radar dome, half-buried in prairie grass, like it was built to listen to the stars and then got forgotten when nothing answered.

My dad worked here before me. Two decades, give or take. Before that, he was Army ya know ... back when the wars were in jungles and deserts. He never talked about it unless there was whiskey in the glass and the lights were low, and even then, you’d get more out of the cigarette smoke than his words.

I followed him in, did my own time. Different war. Different jungles, different desert. Still sand in the boots.

When I got back, I drifted for a while. Picked up work where I could—warehouses, truck stops, road crews. Nothing that stuck. Then the site called when pops knees started hurtin. No interview. No questions. Just a badge and a rotation sheet with my name already printed.

Folks say it was a listening post, or maybe part of some old satellite program. Cold War stuff—back when the government still thought the stars might be talking. It’s decommissioned now. “Structurally intact, externally monitored,” or some such nonsense. That’s what the forms say. They don’t say what’s inside. I don’t have the keys.

But they pay on time, and that’s more than most.

Nights are long out here. Nothing but the wind moving through the wheat and the odd coyote who hasn’t figured out the fence doesn’t buzz anymore. I walk the perimeter, log my rounds, sit in the shack with a thermos and pop's old flashlight. I keep it pointed toward the dome, even though nothing ever happens.

That’s the funny thing about places like this.

Nothing ever happens… until something does, and usually when it does, it ain't worth logging.

The shack’s about the size of a garden shed. Tin roof, two windows, a little desk with warped corners, and a folding chair that wobbles when you lean the wrong way. There’s a space heater in the corner, but it only works when it wants to. Most nights I just layer up and drink hot coffee slow.

I’ve got an old radio out here. Doesn’t pick up much besides grainy AM talk shows and church music from across the state line. Sometimes I leave it on for the company, just low enough to mix with the wind. There’s a kind of comfort in half-heard voices, like listening to ma and pops talk in the kitchen while you're in bed half asleep.

The logbook’s still the same one my pops used. His handwriting’s there—tight, all-caps letters from a time when he still cared enough to write neat. I don’t keep it that clean. Just scribble the rounds, time stamps, anything that looks out of place. Not that anything ever does.

I park my truck behind the shack where the wind won’t sandblast the paint. Keep a cot in the back in case I want to stretch out during the slow hours, though I rarely do. Sleep doesn’t come easy out here. Not because it’s scary—just... too quiet. Too still.

Out beyond the dish, the land just keeps going. Flat and brown in the cold months, green and waving in summer. No houses. No lights. You could walk a mile in any direction and still feel like you’re standing in the same spot. It’s beautiful in that hard, indifferent way some parts of the country are. The kind of place that doesn’t care if you’re here or not.

I don’t see people much. There’s a guy named Morris who handles daytime site checks—makes sure the fences haven’t caved in or caught on fire, I guess. We nod when we pass on shift change, maybe share a word or two about the weather. That’s enough.

It’s not much of a life, maybe. But it’s clean, it’s quiet, and it’s mine.

Some nights, I think about taking a break.

I’ve got a cousin down in Clearwater—runs a garage, fixes up old boats when the tourists aren’t breaking down on the interstate. He always says I oughta come visit, see what saltwater smells like. Says he’s got a spare room with a view of some palm tree he’s named Sheila.

Lately, I’ve been thinking he might be right.

Maybe take a few months. Let him show me the boardwalk, buy me a beer, let the sun bleach the quiet outta my bones. I’ve even considered asking if he’d want to cover a few shifts out here. He’s got the discipline for it. A man who can fix a carburetor in August heat can probably handle the silence.

It’s not that I’m sick of it out here. It’s just... the days don’t change. You line enough of ‘em up, and the years start to go blurry. Like fence posts out a truck window.

So, yeah. I’ve been thinkin’ about shaking the dust loose a little.

I was leaning back in the shack chair one night, mid-thought about the taste of grilled snapper and whether I even own swim trunks anymore, when I noticed it.

Not a noise. Not a bang or a crack or a shift in the wind.

A glow.

Faint. Yellowish. Barely there.

It was coming from inside the building under the dish.

Now, that dome’s been dark since I started here. Long before, too. The outer glass is caked in dirt and prairie dust so thick it’s like looking through pond water. But there it was—a flicker, way in the back, like someone struck a match in a room they weren’t supposed to be in.

I blinked. Sat forward. Waited. Nothing.

No movement. No follow-up.

Just the night. Just the wheat.

I told myself it was the moon catching on a scratch in the glass. A trick of reflection. Hell, maybe the radio tower two counties over finally threw a signal strong enough to bounce.

Still...

I kept the flashlight pointed that way a little longer than usual on my next round.

I told myself I’d mention the light to Mo in the morning.

Not that he’d care. He’s more likely to shrug and blame it on moonshine reflections or my flash light's reflection. But still—felt like the sort of thing you’re supposed to say out loud. The kind of note that clears your conscience, just in case.

“Hey, saw a flicker in the dome last night. Might’ve been nothing. Thought you oughta know.”

That was the plan.

I sat back down, rubbed the sleep from my eyes. Thought about grabbing another cup of coffee, but I was warm, the air inside the shack still carrying the last breath of the heater’s sputter.

Maybe it was the quiet. Maybe it was the way the wind had settled. Maybe it was just the kind of tired that doesn’t come from doing anything—just being somewhere for too long.

Either way, my eyes shut.

Not all the way. Just that heavy-lid kind of doze you get after midnight, where you can still hear the hum of the walls and feel the weight of the thermos in your lap.

That’s when something beeped, not my casio reminding me of my next shift—sharp, mechanical, and way too close to my ear.

I opened my eyes.

But what really woke me…

…was the sound.

I blinked a few times.

The shack was just as I’d left it. Heater ticking in the corner. Radio murmuring static and gospel.

Nothing had moved.

But something felt off. That prickling behind the ears kind of wrong. Like you’d missed a step in the dark.

I rubbed my face, reached for the thermos—then paused.

Outside, just past the fogged glass of the shack’s north window, the radar dish was no longer facing west.

It had shifted.

Barely—maybe a few feet. But enough that I noticed the change in silhouette.

I stared at it for a long while. Tried to convince myself it was an illusion. A trick of the eyes. Maybe the wind nudged it.

But the night was still.

Too still.

And then I heard it—low and bone-deep—the metal-on-metal groan of something heavy turning against its will. A sound thick with rust and age, like teeth grinding on ice.

It crawled up the back of my neck, settled behind my eyes. Made my teeth ache.

The dish had moved. Not by storm. Not by accident.

Something had turned it.

The staircase groaned under my boots as I climbed toward the module tucked beneath the dish. It sat about ten, maybe fifteen feet off the ground—suspended, like it had been dropped there and forgotten.

The glow was coming from one of its windows.

The module looked just like I remembered—steel-plated, dull with rust and prairie dust, its sides streaked with the kind of grime you only get from years of wind and sun. Cables spilled from its underside, disappearing into the dirt like veins feeding something that should’ve died a long time ago.

One window caught my eye. Caked in dirt thick enough to write your name in. Behind it, a faint yellow light—uneven, flickering like an old flashlight in a drawer nobody checked anymore.

I stood there, staring.

Nothing moved.

Out of habit, I reached for the walkie. Gave it a tap, tried the switch again. Still dead.

So I climbed. The metal steps rang under my boots, each one louder than it needed to be. The air changed as I got higher—heavier, tighter. Like walking into a room that’d been sealed off for decades.

At the top, I leaned toward the door’s little window. Wiped the grime with my sleeve, squinting through the streaks.

Inside looked like a time capsule. Console panels, dust-choked monitors, plastic chairs nudged just out of line. Every surface was buried in age. Except—one screen was on.

Pale yellow. Flickering. Barely enough to see by.

Then something moved.

Across the room—cutting the light from the monitor. A ripple. A shadow. Just enough to pull your gut tight.

I stepped back. Slow. Cold air slid down my collar like a warning.

Something—someone—was in there.

And for the first time in five years of nothing ever happening… Something happened

…I wasn’t sure I wanted to open the door, I was unarmed.

I stood there with my hand near the latch, half convincing myself I hadn’t seen anything at all.

Just shadows. A monitor glitch. Dust on the glass.

Then I heard it.

A voice.

Not loud, not shouting. Just... speaking. Clear and calm, like it belonged to someone who didn’t need to raise it to be heard.

It wasn’t local. Had that strange, clipped rhythm I’d only ever heard overseas—like those British liaison guys we worked with once in Ramadi. Real proper. Smooth, like their words were polished before they let them out.

“Hello?” it said, polite but too still. “Is someone there?”

I didn’t answer right away. My brain was still catching up.

Then, finally—“Who are you?”

A pause, long enough to hear the low hum inside the module.

“That’s what I was going to ask,” the voice replied.

It sounded almost amused. But not quite. Like someone trying on a smile they didn’t know how to wear.

“I’m site security,” I said, hearing my own voice come out too flat, too slow—like the job never really expected me to say that out loud. “You’re not supposed to be in there.”

A pause—long enough that I started thinking maybe it was done.

Then:

“I know.”

The words were soft. Precise. Like they’d been polished on the tongue for years before they were allowed out.

“I won’t be here long. I’m just waiting.”

I stepped closer to the door, boots crunching on the frost-laced platform.

“Waiting for what?” I asked.

“For friends,” the voice said.

That stopped me cold. Something about the way it said friends—like it meant more than me. Like I’d already lost some kind of race I didn’t know I was running. The voice itself was a low rasp, almost ancient—like a man too old for the world he’s still standing in.

“Do I have anything to worry about?” I asked, my hand itching toward the drawer back in the shack where I kept a short Colt Python.

“No. You’re… incidental. But my friends won’t cause trouble.”

The air tightened around me.

I swallowed. “So what are you doing here?”

“I was brought here,” it said. “To observe. To wait. And now… to bear witness.”

“Bear witness? Witness what?”

A soft whirring started up behind the door. Mechanical, but off-tempo. Like breathing. Like memory.

“To you,” it said.

I blinked. “What are you doing in there? Why are your friends coming?”

A long silence.

Then: “They are coming… so I can leave.”

My throat dried out. “Where are you from?”

No hesitation this time.

“Far.”

I leaned in, ear near the door, and heard a shuffle. Something breathing. Something real.

“They will be here soon.”

I stood frozen, heart hammering dull and hollow in my chest.

Then, like a shrug wrapped in words:

“But while I wait… we could talk.”

That shouldn’t have sounded like an invitation. But it did. Like someone offering a chair beside a grave.

“…About what?”

“You, of course.”

Something shifted inside. Like a chair dragged gently across linoleum. The air seemed to breathe back at me.

“What’s your name?” it asked, curious—not invasive, but interested. As if my name were an ingredient in a recipe it was trying to learn by heart.

I hesitated. “Why?”

“I’d like to know who I’m speaking with,” it said. “You know of me. Seems only fair.”

“…Bill,” I lied.

A soft chuckle. Nearly human. Nearly.

“Hello, Bill. You walk here often. I’ve seen you.”

I blinked. “…I work here.”

“Yes. That’s what I meant.”

It spoke like someone who’d only heard human voices through speakers. There was a nearness to it, but always just a few steps off. Like an echo too eager to sync up.

“Do you enjoy the silence?” it asked.

“No,” I said. Honest.

“Then why stay?”

“Pays the bills.”

“I see.”

A moment passed, and I tested it.

“…Can I open the door?”

“No.”

Firm. Final. Not unkind.

“Why not?”

“Because I’m not done getting to know you, Bill.”

I looked down at my boots. Frost clinging in soft spirals.

“You always ask strangers this many questions?”

“I don’t meet many strangers. Just you.”

I didn’t know what to do with that.

After a moment: “Not much to tell.”

“I’d still like to hear.”

“Grew up near here. Dad had this job. Then I went to war. Different war. Came back when he got sick. Took over. That’s about it.”

“You were a soldier,” the voice said. “Did you enjoy war?”

“No.”

A pause.

“Did you feel proud?”

“…Sometimes. Got some medals.”

Another pause. Then:

“Were the medals worth what it cost?”

That landed hard. Not judgment. Just math.

“I didn’t come here for therapy,” I said. “You with the VA or something?”

“I mean no harm,” the voice replied.

The wind brushed the dome like a question.

“Why do you care?” I asked. “Why know me?”

Soft movement inside.

“Because they are coming. And they’ll want to know if you’re my friend.”

That hit something deep and strange.

“Why does it matter if we’re friends?”

Long silence.

Then, quietly:

“Because friends aren’t afraid of each other.”

I cleared my throat, trying to steady the air between us.
“Where are your friends? When are they arriving” I asked.

“They are coming,” the voice replied. “They are here ... look above.”

I felt a flicker of tension tighten my chest.
“Above? What the ... ?”

Silence.

Then, faintly:

“There are a few steps before they land. Not everyone is a friend.”

The words caught me off guard. Land? In a place like this?

My head snapped up—toward the sky, toward the edge of the dome’s shadow.

And then I saw it.

A light. Faint at first, like a distant star plucked from the heavens. But moving, descending, threading between clouds and prairie wind.

My breath hitched.
“Is that—” I began.

“No, not a helicopter,” the voice said, cutting in calmly. “My friends do not travel like that.”

The star cut through the darkness, swift and firm—wrong, but not anything I'd ever seen.
Within seconds it was above the dome—directly overhead. A massive round object of shimmering color, wobbling, humming with an energy that pinned me silent.

Inside, the voice softened.

“They are here, do you see them? Do you see my friends” it repeated.

I didn’t answer.

I couldn’t.

The thing—whatever it was—hovered like judgment itself, silent but alive, pressing the air down until my ears ached and my teeth hummed. It was like standing beneath a storm that forgot how to thunder, but remembered how to watch.

Something ancient in me cracked open.

I dropped.

Not from pain. Not from any push.

I just… dropped.

Hit the platform knees-first, hands flat against the cold steel, forehead soon after. My breath came in shallow gasps, chest heaving.

And then I did something I hadn’t done since my second tour—since the firefight that pinned us under a shattered minaret—I prayed. Quietly. Stumbling words. Scrambled ones.

“Please, God, just let it pass.”

I don’t remember how long I stayed there, whispering apologies and pleas like a child with a monster under the bed.

Then—just as sudden as it came—the hum stopped.

Gone.

Like someone had flipped off the sky.

Silence rushed back in, and with it, another sound.

Click.

The door opened behind me.

Soft. Careful.

Then it closed.

Another sound—footsteps. Not boots. Not heavy. Just... light. Measured. Barefoot, almost.

My body went stiff. Breath caught in my throat.

I felt it behind me. Presence.

Then something touched my back.

A hand.

Not heavy. Not aggressive.

Just... a touch.

I flinched, eyes still shut tight.

But something in me cracked open again, softer this time. I opened my eyes—just a sliver—face still turned downward.

What I saw...

Three long toes. Pale grey skin. No shoes. No sound.

The feet turned. Walked away.

I didn’t dare lift my head.

Then—a low whir, like a mechanism shifting into place.

And it was gone.

I don’t remember standing. Just the cold cot under me. My legs moved like they had their own orders—half-drunk, half-dreaming.

I sat there in the shack, staring at nothing.

The stars still hung above. The dish still loomed. And the silence—deeper now—settled back like nothing had happened.

Then came the crunch of boots on gravel.

“You okay?” Mo’s voice. Closer. Warmer. Human. “What the hell happened out here?”

He stepped into the doorway, eyes squinting against the sunrise. “Looks like a damn storm blew through. Debris everywhere. Fence’s bent. One of the warning signs is hanging upside down.”

I looked up at him, slowly.

He stared at me for a second, like he was deciding if I was pulling his leg.

“You alright?”

I opened my mouth before I had a plan.

“…I think I met someone,” I said.

“Someone?” Mo blinked. “Who?”

I paused. The words felt too strange out loud. I rubbed my face, trying to ground myself in something normal.

“I don’t know. I think it left.”

He frowned, took another step in. “Left? Who left?”

I met his eyes for the first time and gave him the only truth I had left.

“A friend,” I said quietly.

Then, after a breath—

“At least… I hope a friend.”
