Hi,

My name is Josh, and I don't think that you're going to believe me. Hell, I'm pulling my own leg just by thinking anyone will read this. It's more for my sake than anyone else's, kind of like shouting  into the void, if that makes any sense. Maybe some of you horror junkies will stumble upon this. At the very least, I hope you find my plight entertaining… back to the point; something strange is going on and i'm going to hope that if it reaches anyone that they reach out, maybe let me know what to make of this situation.

It was two weeks ago, when it all started, Halloween night when *they* first arrived (I know very cliche, stay with me) . I wasn't expecting anyone. I live in the woods, my driveway is a mile long which does me a lot of good when it comes to keeping the Mormons and the Jehovah's witnesses and the girls scouts out of my way. No offense to any of those groups, I just want to be left alone. I'm not a big cookie or organized religion kind of guy (sorry). It also means no Trick-or-Treaters . Every year is the same. I watch some horror movies, eat the candy I bought for said absentee Trick-or-Treaters and go to sleep. I've Lived here for five years so I had expected a calm night and it was calm, until about ten . That was when I heard my dog Winifred start growling. Then I heard it, the knocking. I probably would have opened the door right then and there. If my dog wasn't as worked up as she was. So I told myself that it was UPS or something, they saw that my lights were on and started knocking to let me know that there was a package (post people do that right?) I wasn't about to let Winnie trample this person just because they spooked her. So I stayed on the couch, and continued watching  Lifetime. But the knocking didn't stop. It got louder and louder and louder rapidly drumming on my door for twenty minutes while my dog barked and barked until I couldn't take it any more.

“Just leave it at the door!” I called. The knocking and barking stopped for maybe a solid minute before it started back up again. I didn't know if this was a prank but with how late it was I was starting to feel uneasy . I don't own a gun or any weapons for that matter but at that moment I felt like I needed one. I preface now that I'm not a violent person and I've never felt the need to defend myself while I've lived here, but This was starting to get fucking creepy. So I grabbed a knife from the kitchen block. I wasn't expecting the person at the door to have my best interests at heart. so, knife in hand went to the door and stood there for a moment hesitating, as the knocking stopped. (Not a surprise considering all the lights were on in the house they probably saw my shadow.)

I finally got the courage to open up the door.I cracked it open hiding my body behind it. What was standing on my doorstep at first was a relief, *kids*. Impatient kids! A girl who looked to be about ten with shaggy bangs that covered her eyes. She wore a light pink sweatshirt and jeans that looked dirty. Holding her hand was a boy who looked to be about seven, maybe eight. He had on a green tee shirt with green shorts and a bull cut. He was looking at his feet.

“Can we come in?” the girl said before I could muster anything. The relief left as quick as it came. This pit in my stomach grew,  not necessarily because of her question but rather the peculiarity of it all. I looked over the kids shoulders. There wasn't a parent in sight. I don't have kids but I have never understood letting children go out alone on Halloween at least not in my area. It just doesn't seem safe. Not only that, but if I haven't said it enough yet, it was ten-ish at night and my driveway is ONE MILE LONG UPHILL. Meaning; that these kids would have had to without a parent climbed up my one mile driveway, uphill, in the dark, all for a fun-size pack of m&m’s. They also weren't in costume–

“Can we come in?” she asked again

“No” I said a little more blunt than I intended “but I can get you guys some candy” without really waiting for their response I closed the door and went into the kitchen to get the candy. I looked down at the knife in my hand as Winnie snarled at the door. This was weird but despite my nerves they were just children. At the moment I felt awful for even grabbing the knife to begin with. So I put it back in the block grateful that no one got hurt. If only I knew what I know now I might have acted differently. As I got the candy the knocking started again as impatient as before, loud and  rapid . I told myself that they were probably just excited to get a treat.  As soon as I opened the door the girl said through gritted teeth in a voice that I've never heard a child use said

“**We do not want your candy.**” then she and her brother and I stood there for a second-maybe two. Until in that same tone

“**We want to use your phone. Can we come inside and use your phone?**” she asked firmly in a kind of tone that made it clear that this wasn't really a question. I can't tell you why (because I still don't know,) but something inside of me felt more wrong than before. Like the pit in my stomach had become a gaping hole.

“Why do you need to use the phone?” I asked with a nervous quiver in my voice. It felt hard to move in that moment.

“To phone our mother. We are lost.” The girl responded with the same nails- on-a-chalkboard voice.

“I left my phone inside. You can give me her number and I can call her for you” I responded I wanted them to leave, I just wanted them to leave. To stay out of my house and leave.

“No. it would be easier if we just came in and called her ourselves.” I'd never seen kids so eager to get into a stranger's house. Whoever their mom was, she certainly hadn't told them about stranger danger.  If it were any other circumstance I would have let them in but something in my gut told me not to.

“Well I can bring my phone out to you if you want.” I offered

“No” she said I was starting to get frustrated, if they really needed the phone wouldn't they be okay with just using the phone outside?

“I can bring my phone outside for you or you two can leave.” I said. putting my foot down. I felt a flush of guilt as I said it as if I was engulfed in a strong current. What if there was someone else outside and they didn't want to be alone? What if they really needed help? If they needed help they would have told me right? It had been silent for a while. We were all just staring at each other. I think I had waited because even if I didn't feel comfortable I would feel much worse if something bad were to happen so I asked again firmly “Should I get my phone?”

“No.” she said again “can we come in?”

“No” I closed the door. I promise that I'm not this blunt normally and if I truly thought that these kids were in danger that I would have let them in. They looked well, calm, almost menacingly so.  I know that they were just kids but I still locked, dead-bolted the door, and turned on the outdoor light more for my sake than theirs so I could see them if they decided to outstay their welcome any longer. They did.  It was silent for a while, Winnie standing at the door no longer growling but still protective.

“It's okay, it's okay ”I said while petting Winnie. I turned out the lights near the doorway so that if they were still outside they wouldn't be able to see me. I found myself checking to make sure all of the doors and windows of my house were closed and locked as Winnie followed close behind me. I decided it was time for bed. I went upstairs, got ready and went to sleep Winnie on my feet.

It was roughly 4 AM when I abruptly woke up to Winnie growling at my bedroom door then I heard it. The sound of knocking had come again rapidly, again impatient and again louder. Winnie let out another low growl while pawing at my leg. I thought it might have been a dream until I looked out the window and it became real.

“Holy shit” I muttered they were still out there. I decided this had to be a prank someone had put them up to. That was the only logical explanation and it was the one I clung to oh so dearly. I didn't feel like sleeping, couldn't sleep actually because that wretched knocking continued for the rest of the fucking night.

Winnie stood alert ceaselessly responding to the knocks with barks. I knew all of the doors were locked but something compelled me to stay in my room, as if I was safer there. I stayed there until daybreak. By then it had become too much so I went downstairs and shouted through the door that I was going to call the police unless they left my property. They didn't. *Yeah*, instead of leaving, the knocking became ceaseless for the next hour. So, I called the police.

Needless to say, these kids were deeply disturbing me. obviously. There was however this feeling, the kind of feeling you get right as you're caught in a lie, the adrenaline rush that makes you feel like you're falling for a split second. I was shaking as I dialed the number. Before there was even a reply I felt that there was some kind of futility to the call, I felt as if I knew that nothing would come of it.“911 what’s your emergency?”

“Hello” I said “there are two kids on my doorstep, they’ve been standing there all night asking to come in when I said no but they’ve refused to leave and they’ve been knocking on my door all night” the operator asked what my address was and told me that they would send some officers over to see what they could do.

I stayed on the phone with the operator, locking myself in my bedroom once more as we spoke. Although it was silly, it brought me the slightest tinge of relief. The operator spoke with me for a while. I kept reiterating that it didn't feel safe, but, I don't think that they were taking me *that* seriously, they must have thought that they were listening to the ramblings of a madman whose mind was unfurling on the other end of the line, I think that the operator was just trying to calm me down. It took about 30 minutes for the police to find my house. I heard the sound of wheels on gravel. I listened. Silence. The din of that effervescent pounding drum on my door was gone. It had stopped for the first time since it had started again. I unlocked my bedroom and slowly came down the stairs. The creaks under my feet felt as if they were booming, thundering, and blaring, as if it were the sound of gunfire loud and menacing. But what came next must have been an atomic bomb in comparison; the slew bangs on my door. I swear I almost had a heart attack right then and there. I crept to a window peering through the blinds, to my relief there were the officers. I came to the door and opened it, Let them in, and told them my story again.

“Well sir ” one of the officers said “there wasn't anyone at your door when we got here,”

“-that doesn't mean-” I started to protest but I was cut off

“-I’m not saying that they weren't here, I'm just asking if you would have any idea where they might be.” he continued “this is probably just some kind of joke, but you said they were young ”

“Yes” I responded “they were really young”

“And they were knocking all night?”

“Yes”

“And there was no way for them to get inside of the house?”

“Not that I know of” (I had made sure of that.)

"If these were teenagers it would be a different story, but kids as young as you're describing, someones probably missing them. May we search the woods?."  I told the officers that they could look, I gave them a better description of the kids and they were off. They told me that they'd let me know if they found anything. I wish they had.

Some time after the officers had vanished into the woods the knocking began again. pounding. It was combated with a chorus of barks from Winnie. I couldn't exactly call 911 again and there wasn't anything I could do until the police got back. I peered out the window and there they were, the same two kids. I knew they were there before I had looked but something about my eyes' own conformation made my heart pump faster. As before I took Winnie by her collar and went back to my bedroom. locking myself in. the knocking kept going and going and going and *going.*  When the police came back the noise stopped and I told them what had happened. They told me that they hadn't seen any children, but to call them if I needed anything else. It's been two weeks since then and in that time I've called the police over fifty times. I think they have my name on a list now because every time I call  they ask me to stop. The reason is because as soon as the the police left, the last time they visited, one week ago (right before I got fucking blacklisted), the knocking started again and it hasn't stopped since. I haven't slept since it started, and I don't know when or if it will ever stop or how to get them to just leave. I am truly and sincerely asking for anyone whoever reads this to give me some way to get through it.

please,

help.
