Ok, I honestly don't know where to begin,  
I guess at the beginning lol, so before I was born my mom told me a story on when I was about to be born, she saw a huge spider with a bunch of spiderlings in the corner of her room, it scared her so bad that she had a panic attack, then the doctors detected something wrong with my pancreas, which was supposed to be fixable by a simple surgery after birth, so they did just that, but they screwed things up, and since then I had multiple surgeries fixing the problems that came after that mistake, and I have been sick over and over again, in and out of hospitals (currently in a hospital as I'm typing this)  
I then moved to Ecuador, at 13 years old, since then my life has gone spiraling down, I have lost my faith to the Lord, despite the amazing experience I had at 11, felt like going to a completely different continent, different country, really was a tough experience, not long after that, my aunt died at 29 years old, within a week. But life went on, during that time I was living in my grandparents house (from my dads side) and since I stepped foot in the 40 year old house I felt this overwhelming darkness, a feeling like something was preying on my anxiety, my fear and my depression, it felt draining. but when I went outside the feeling slowly dissipated and my energy was returned to me, I was living in that house for a few years, during my teenage years there I had a room with no windows, my bed in the corner my desk beside my bed, and a closet in front of my bed which used to hold generations of old toys from my great grandfather to my own toys, one night as I woke up to use the restroom I saw the closet door fling open, and two kids, pale as snow, with sunken eyes, one girl and one boy, dressed in old timely clothing were playing around with a ball, they looked at me and asked my directly if I wanted to play, I couldn't scream I couldn't move, I was paralyzed with fear, I managed to cover myself with the blanket and force shut my eyes....  
As I grew up, I grew used to the negative energy and heaviness surrounding the house, it was bearable, however 2020 came, and just before the pandemic my grandmother died, she was the light of the house that kept the suffocating darkness away, she prayed every morning and blessed the house every night and before dawn. So, she died suddenly going to church, she had a heart attack with no prior warning. since then the house grew darker, suffocating, it was hard for me to breathe, cabinets kept opening, plants kept moving on their own without any windows open, I heard footsteps, I have seen "duendes" tiny small men out in the patio but that gave off a neutral feeling, not bad, but not good either.  
during this entire time, I was in and out of hospitals constantly with liver infections and IV antibiotics, I was weak, both physically and emotionally.  
Come 2022 I got really sick, my kidneys started failing for no reason at all, and I stayed 5 days in ICU, and bout 40 more days in the hospital, receiving dialysis, and plasma, and blood transfusions, every day.  
After I got discharged, I looked for therapy because my depression was over the roof, so I went with a "holistic" psychologist recommended by my uncle, because she treated my cousin and got him out of a deep depression as well, so during one of our sessions I mentioned the overwhelming heaviness that has been draining me from inside of the house, I was 19-20 at the time ( for time reference I'm currently 21 Turing 22) so she brought in a medium who was also a psychologist, and my folks and I sat in a circle in the office, and repeated some dumb chants the women made us do "for protection" and then the medium needed my dads "permission" to psychically travel to the house to see what was in there, she reported that she saw a black shadow, a masculine presence, old, and that is dominating over the energy there,  
then, the attacks started, I started having recurring nightmares of a horrible creature with a horse skulls face, long limbs and goat hooves, always chasing me throughout that house, I woke up with bruises, and three scratch marks on my back, stomach and neck, every day, so we called in a pastor from my folks church (they are protestant) he basically affirmed it, there was not one but multiple negative entities inside that house, and inside my room.  
One night during the middle of a praying session and a blessing session, I felt burning on my skin I went to the bathroom and it attacked me in the middle of prayer, three long scratches across my chest, I had a full blown panic attack, I was terrified to keep praying because I could hear it mocking me, mocking the prayer, insulting my mother, (she heard the thing too, so did my uncle who was living downstairs at the time) I could hear it getting angrier, so I stopped praying and, my mom and sister and I fled immediately and stayed for months at my moms moms house. Since then my folks and I moved to another apartment 2 blocks from that wretched house, and have put it to sale, it hasn't sold yet...  
I refuse to set a foot inside that living hell of a house, my folks say its gone, but once I did try to go in, up in my old room, and I felt it, I felt it saying in a horrible mocking way "look who is back." thankfully that time I got the hell out before anything else happened. since then I haven't stepped foot inside that house.  
the reason why im writing this is last night during the little sleep I got, I had a nightmare of a demon again, it was as if I woke up, in my hospital room, and a billion spiders came out of the darkest corners of the room and formed into a horrible human and toad faced spider bodied being, and something in me told me that that THING has been the root of my sickness from before I was born, I told my mother this when I awoke, and she thought it couldn't be a dream because she recalled seeing a big black spider the size of a dinner plate covered with tiny spiders in the corner of her room before I was even born.  
So, the house entity hasn't been able to harm me any longer, but I think the thing that has been making me constantly ill has finally revealed itself to me, I need your help on finding out the name, and how to get rid of it.  
characteristics of the house thing:  
shadow, horse skull face, long limbs, sharp claws, goats hooves and horns, drains energy, feeds off of fear, despair and depression.  
characteristics of the spider demon  
human face with 8 black and sunken eyes, a spiders body made up of black spiders, sharp teeth, withered face toad face,
