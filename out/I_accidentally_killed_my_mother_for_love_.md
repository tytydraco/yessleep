I lived in a house where darkness seeped through every crack, a place suffused with the oppressive weight of my Mother’s cruelty. Mother's abuse was a daily torment, leaving my siblings and I battered and broken, both physically and emotionally. Mother’s rage was a storm that never ceased, her voice a constant barrage of venomous words, her hands instruments of pain.

The beatings were relentless. My older brother, Jacob, bore the brunt of Mother's fury, his body always covered with bruises and scars.

My younger sister, Emily, cowered in corners, her spirit crushed under the weight of our Mother's hatred. 

I, the middle child, tried to shield them as best she could, her own body often absorbing the blows meant for them.

One night, while huddled at a sleep over. My friend whispered about a man who lived in the forest who could save us from this with a simple drug. 

The next day, I sneaked away into the dense forest surrounding our home. The deeper I ventured, the darker the forest became, as if the trees themselves were swallowing the light. Finally, I stumbled upon a clearing where an eerie figure stood, shrouded in shadows. His name was Lucian, a tall, gaunt man with eyes that gleamed like polished onyx, and I think I fell in love with him. 

Lucian listened to my story, his expression unreadable. "I can help you," he said, his voice a soft, sinister whisper which was somewhat trusting and attractive. "I have a potion that can change your mother, but magic comes with a cost."

I was too desperate to question further, so I agreed. Lucian handed me a small, ornate vial filled with a dark, viscous liquid. "One drop," he instructed. "No more."

That night, I waited until the house was silent, my siblings asleep. I tiptoed into Mother's room, my heart pounding in her chest. In the pale moonlight, Mother's face was a mask of cruelty even in sleep. With trembling hands, I uncorked the vial and let a single drop fall onto her mother's lips.

For a moment, nothing happened. Then Mother's body convulsed violently, her eyes snapping open wide with terror. She clawed at her throat, skin blistering and bubbling, a horrible gurgling sound escaping her lips. Her flesh began to melt away, revealing a grotesque, skeletal form beneath. The stench of burning flesh filled the room as Mother's body disintegrated into a pile of ash.

My scream tore through the night, a sound of pure, unadulterated horror. I fled the house, her mind reeling from what she had done. She ran back to the forest, to Lucian, my only hope of understanding the nightmare I had unleashed.

When I reached the clearing, Lucian was waiting. "She's dead," I sobbed, collapsing at his feet. "I killed her."

Lucian knelt beside me, his touch cold and comforting. "You did what was necessary," he whispered. "Now you are free."

But freedom came at a terrible price. Guilt gnawed at my soul a relentless torment that consumed me. Even though i hated Mother i never wanted her to die. 

I clung to Lucian, drawn to his dark, enigmatic presence.

Days turned into weeks, and my obsession with him deepened, the lines between love and madness blurring.

Lucian revealed his true nature gradually, his humanity peeling away to reveal the monster beneath. He was a shape-shifter, a creature of ancient evil who fed on the souls of the damned. I was blinded by love and guilt, agreed to bind myself to him torever.

The ritual was performed under a blood-red moon, deep within the bowels of the earth. Lucian carved ancient symbols into my flesh, each cut a promise of eternal devotion. She chanted forbidden words, my voice mingling with the anguished cries of the damned that echoed through the cavern.

As the final incantation left my lips, a surge of dark power ripped through me, tearing my soul from my body and binding it to Lucian's. 
I felt myself dissolve, my essence entwining with his, a dark symbiosis that promised eternal love and damnation.

I never knew what happened to my siblings. I was stuck with Lucian for the rest of eternity and every day regret still formed deep within but with him blissfully by my side, everything seemed ok. I trusted him. He even let me see Mother in hell.

Hey reader! Thanks for reading my story. this is one of the first ones i wrote when i was 12. It was supposed to be a mixture of the story from Brave where Merida gives her mom the cake to change her and Beauty and the Beast where Bell falls in love with her capture or the guy that helped her basically. Reading over this story it’s extremely morbid but i really wanted to share with you all this story.
