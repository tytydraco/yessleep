you are probably wondering why I chose a such a silly name for this post but I assure you its not so silly once you know the truth.

I was in the middle of Class when my friend Rick Asked ''you wanna have a Sleepover at my place after school?

I responded with ''Sure lets invite Aaron also'' 

As I finished my sentence Rick asked ''Can we invite Jennifer''

I wanted to say ''Why this bitch'' But to be nice I said sure.

We decided to meet at Ricks house. On the walk home I over heard about a story of The Poopy Monster. I laughed it off.

I arrived at Ricks house I always thought there was something creepy about his house. It was probably the fact that his house was close to a dense forest.

The second I walked in his house It seemed oddly uneasy. I walked up to his room and sat down. Shortly after Aaron walked into the room carrying a 12 pack of mountain dew. As we were playing video games Jennifer walked into the room me and Aaron looked at each other and gave a look of disgust. 

After a While we decided to tell scary stories. They were all Pretty mediocre. So I decided to tell them about the story I heard earlier about The Poopy Monster. They all laughed it off except of Jennifer She told us she saw it outside these woods.

We all Thought it would be funny to explore the woods to look for it. As we were preparing to find it we hear screaming coming from Jennifer saying to look out the window and we see that The Poopy Monster staring at the window.

We immediately close the curtains and we put barricades on the door and find anything to use as a weapon and places to hide. As we are doing that we hear pounding from the front door. Aaron said ''we should let him in he's just shit''

We hear the door blast open. We all scatter to find hiding spots. We all hide on the roof outside the window while Aaron hid in the near by closet Aaron jokingly said'' It smells like Shit'' The second he said that We heard another pounding noise coming from the bedroom door.

The Poopy Monster Was in. We hear as Aarons scaring last words are '' he's right behind me isn't he''

We all jump off the roof to run to the woods. I ran with Rick and we both lost sight of Jennifer. As we were catching our breath we hear screaming coming from far away Jennifer was dead. In the distance we found an abandoned house in the distance.

We enter the house and find shelter. I saw in a cabinet 2 guns me and Rick grab both and decide to look for HIM. as we are leaving the house we got ambushed by THE POOPY MONSTER. Rick got bit by The Poopy Monster he told me to shoot so I did. Then I ran to a gas station that was empty then I passed out and I woke up in my bed thinking it was a dream then I turned on my phone to call Rick Then he answers only to say POOPY FOREVER PART 2 COMING 2026
