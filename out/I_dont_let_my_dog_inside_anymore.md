**Day 1** I didn't think anything of it at first. I was in the kitchen, filling a glass at the sink; it was late afternoon—that heavy, quiet part of the day where the house feels like it's holding its breath. I had just let Winston out back. Same routine. Same dog. While the water ran, I glanced out the window and saw he was standing on the patio, facing the yard. Perfectly still. What caught my attention was his mouth. It was open. Not panting—just slack. It looked wrong, disjointed, like he was holding a toy I couldn't see, or like his jaw had simply unhinged. Then he stepped forward. On his hind legs. It wasn't a hop. It wasn't a circus trick. It wasn't that clumsy, desperate balance dogs do when they beg for food. He walked. Slow. Balanced. Casual. The weight distribution was terrifyingly human. He didn't bob or wobble—he just strode across the concrete like it was the most natural thing in the world. Like it was easier that way.

I froze, the water overflowing my glass and running cold over my fingers. My brain scrambled for logic—muscle spasms, a seizure, a trick of the light—but this felt private. Invasive. Like I had walked in on something I wasn't supposed to see. Winston didn't look at me. He kept moving forward, upright, his front legs hanging limp and useless at his sides. His mouth stayed open. Like a man wearing a dog suit who forgot the rules. I dropped the glass. It shattered in the sink. The sound must've snapped him out of it because he dropped back down on all fours instantly. He whipped around, tail wagging, tongue lolling out the side of his mouth. Same old Winston. I didn't open the door. I left him out there until sunset.



**Day 2** Nothing happened the next day. That almost made it worse. Winston acted normal; he ate his food, barked at the neighbors walking on the sidewalk, and laid his heavy head on my foot while I tried to watch TV. If you didn't know what I saw, you'd think I was losing my mind. I told my wife, Brandy, that night. She laughed. Not cruelly—just confused. Asked if I took my medication. Asked if I'd been watching messed up horror movies again. She said dogs do weird things, that brains look for patterns where there are none. I laughed with her. I even agreed. But I started watching him. The way he sat. The way he stared at doorknobs—not with confusion, but with patience. The way he tilted his head when we spoke—not listening to tone, but studying words like he’s really trying to understand us. I started locking the bedroom door.



**Day 3** I know how this sounds. But I needed to know. I went down the rabbit hole—not casual searches. Specific ones. The kind you don't type unless you're scared. *"Can demons inhabit animals"* ... *"Mimicry in canines folklore"* ... *"Skinwalkers suburban sightings"*. Most of it was garbage—creepypastas, roleplay forums—but there were patterns. Stories about animals that behaved too correctly. Pets that waited until they were alone to drop the act. Entities that practiced in smaller bodies before moving up. I messaged a few people. Friends. Then strangers. I tried explaining that it wasn't funny—that the mechanics of his walk was physically impossible for a dog. They stopped responding. Winston started standing outside the bedroom door at night. I could see his shadow under the frame. He didn't scratch. He didn't whine. He just stood there. Listening. As if he was a good boy.



**Day 10** I installed cameras. Living room. Kitchen. Patio. Hallway. I needed to catch this little shit in the act. I needed everyone to see what I saw so they would stop looking at me like I was a nut job. I'm not crazy. I reviewed three days of footage. Nothing. Winston sleeping. Eating. Staring at walls. Then I noticed something. In the living room feed, Winston walks from the rug to his water bowl—but he takes a wide arc. He hugs the wall. He moves perfectly through the blind spot where the lens curves and distorts. I didn't notice it until I couldn't stop noticing it. He knows where the cameras are. That bastard knows what they see. I tore them down about an hour ago. There's no point trying to trap something that understands the trap better than you do. Brandy hasn't spoken to me in four... maybe five days. I can't remember. She says I'm manic. She says she's scared—not of the dog, but of me. I've stopped numbering these consistently. Time doesn't feel right anymore.



**Day 47** I don't live there anymore. Brandy asked me to leave about two weeks ago. Said I wasn't the man she married. I think she's right. I've stopped recognizing myself. I lost my job. I can't focus. Never hitting quota. Calls get ignored. I'm drinking too much, I'll admit it. Not to escape, not really, just because it's easier than feeling anything. Food doesn't matter. Hunger doesn't matter. Everything feels like it's slipping through my fingers and I'm too tired to grab it. I walk past stores and wonder how people can look normal. How they can go to work, make dinner, laugh. I can't. I barely remember what it felt like. I still think about Winston. I see him sometimes out of the corner of my eye. Standing. Watching. Mouth open. Waiting. I can't tell if I miss him or if it terrifies me. No one believes what I saw. My family thinks I had a breakdown. Maybe I did. Maybe that's all it is. Depression is supposed to be ordinary, common, overused. That doesn't make it hurt any less. I don't know where I'm going. I just can't go back. Not yet. Not with him there.



**Day 82** dont remember writing 47. dont even rember where i am right now. some friends couch maybe. smells like piss and cat food . but i figured somthing out i think . i dont sleep much anymore. when i do its not dreams its like rewatching things i missed. tiny stuff. Winston used to sit by the back door at night. not scratching. just waiting . i think i trained him to do that without knowing. like you train a person. repetition. Brandy wont answer my calls now. i tried emailing her but i couldnt spell her name right and gmail kept fixing it . feels like the computer knows more than me . i havent eaten in 2 days. maybe 3. i traded my watch for some stuff . dude said i got a good deal cuz i "looked honest." funny . it makes the shaking stop. makes the house feel farther away. like its not right behind me breathing . i forget why i even left. i just know i cant go back. not with him there . i think Winston knows im thinking about him again. i swear i hear his nails on hardwood when im trying to sleep.



**Day 88** lost my phone for a bit. found it in my shoe. dont ask. typing hurts . i drink a lot now. cheaper than food. easier too. nobody asks questions when youre drunk. when youre sober they stare like youre cracked glass. got lucky last night. Same guy outside the gas station. said he "had extra." said i could pay later . real friendly. i told him about my dog for some reason. he laughed but not like it was funny. like he already knew. Winston keeps showing up in my head wrong. standing too straight. mouth open like hes waiting to speak . sometimes i cant remember his bark. only breathing. Brandy mailed me some clothes. no note. just my name in her handwriting. i cried over socks. pathetic . there was dog hair on one of the shirts. tan. coarse. i almost threw up . i think i already warned her. or maybe im still supposed to . hard to tell whats before and after anymore. everything feels stacked wrong. like the days arent meant to touch each other.



**Day 91** im so tired . haven't eaten real food in i dont know how long. hands wont stop even when i hold them down . i traded my jacket today. its cold. doesnt matter. cold keeps me awake . sometimes i forget the word dog. i just think him . people look through me now. like im already gone. maybe thats good . maybe thats how he gets in. through empty things . i remember Winston sleeping at the foot of the bed. remember his weight. remember thinking he made me feel safe . i got another good deal. best one yet. guy said i smiled the whole time. dont rember smiling . i think im finally calm enough to go back. or maybe i already did. the memories are overlapping. like bad copies.



**Day 121** i made it back . dont know how long i stood across the street. long enough for the lights to come on inside. long enough to recognize the shadows through the curtains like old friends . the house looks smaller. or maybe im bigger somehow. stretched wrong. the porch swing is still there. i forgot about the porch swing. Brandy answered the door when i knocked. she didnt jump. didnt look surprised. just tired. like she already knew how this would go . she smelled clean. soap. laundry. normal life. it hurt worse than the cold . she wouldnt let me inside. kept the screen door between us like it mattered. like that thin mesh could stop anything that wanted in . she talked soft. slow. said my name a lot. said she was okay. said Winston was okay.

i asked to see him.

she didn't turn around. Down the hallway, through the dim, i could see the back of the house, the glass patio door glowed faint blue from the yard light. Winston was sitting outside. perfect posture. too straight. facing the glass. not scratching. not whining. just sitting there, mouth slightly open, fogging the door with each slow breath.

i almost felt relief. stupid, warm relief.

Brandy put a hand on the doorframe. i noticed her fingers were curled the same way his front legs used to hang . loose. practiced.

she told me i should go. said she hoped i stayed clean, said she still cared.

i looked at Winston again. then at her.

the timing was off. the breathing matched.

and i understood, finally, why the cameras never caught anything. why he never rushed. why he practiced patience instead of movement. because he didn't need the dog anymore.

Brandy smiled at me. not with her mouth.

i walked away without saying goodbye. from the sidewalk, i saw her in the living room window, just like before. watching. waiting. something tall, dark figure stood beside her, perfectly still.

she never let Winston inside. because he never left.
