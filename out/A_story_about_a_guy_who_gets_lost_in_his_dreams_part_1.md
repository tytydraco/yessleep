That's 1/10 of the story. Message me down in the comment if you like it and if you want part 2.

Chapter 1 (the new beginning):
Have you ever thought of people who don't care about anything at all? About people who don't pay attention at school and the only thing they want is to get other classmates into trouble? We could sit and think together for some time and I would tell you all the bad stuff I was doing while being in school, but it would take literally forever. I'll try to be brief. “My name is Alex and I am a terrible student. I mean, not terrible in the way you would probably think. I am significantly better than most of my classmates when it comes to being clever. The thing is that everything has two sides. I can be a great example. 

“Alex is the name of the best person who you can ever meet. It's me.” (Alex speaking in an egoistic way) “Okay, just kidding. So where did I stop? Oh yes, my behaviors aren’t as good as many people would think. My classmates and teachers find me as the “school bully” because I don't care about anything. I mean, I don't have any boundaries and I like to fight other students. School fights are a very interesting way to chill out and filter your thoughts, you know, right? So that's probably it. Let's get to the mysterious part of my life, something that happened to me.”

The whole thing started on May 10, 2037. It was the first period of the day and we were solving really hard physics problems with forces. The teacher, Tyler, asked me if I could say the correct answers. At this time, I was wondering what it would look like if I just stayed at home all day doing nothing. And also, I had nothing solved. I just said, "I don't care about these problems." My teacher, Tyler, sent me to the principal's office, but I escaped. First, I just wanted to go back to the class, and I wanted to tell Tyler that the principal sent me back there, but somehow, I grabbed my car keys, unlocked my car, went inside, and put something in the navigation. I didn't really know where I was going. All the places that were known to me were just parks and the houses of my friends. 

I left the school and drove to the nearest highway, and then my journey started. At this time, it started to be really dark, and it was like eleven in the morning. One thing was scaring me. There was no final destination or time of arrival on the display of my navigation. After some minutes, the weather became worse and worse. There were huge clouds in front of me. I couldn't see through the massive fog. One thing about that was really interesting. Everything beside me was completely bright, and the road was so shiny. I didn't understand that. All I wanted was to go back. Turn around. Please. I wasn't thinking about anything else. "But how?" I was asking myself, and then I heard something. 

Someone talked to me. I had never been confused that much. There was no one in the car except me. Just me. Also, there were no people on the way. " It's just a dream... "Please wake up." I was repeating it in my mind twice. Then something happened. Another weird thing at first, I heard a huge boom and then that voice. Again. "Find me," it said. I fell asleep.
May 12, 2037: Some birds awakened me, chirping around me near a gas station. I was lying near the road on the grass, and my car was unlocked. The weather differed completely from yesterday. Everything was so green, full of nature, and full of life. I was wondering... what's that? My confusion was getting bigger, but one thing was superb about that. The people. There were so many people. I took my stuff, locked my car, and said again, "That's just a dream." Alex, that's just a dream. Nothing else. Nothing unusual. You are still in bed, and it's not even Monday. Then I grabbed my phone, looked at it, and opened the calendar. 

There was written: "Today is Wednesday, May 12, 2037." "No way..." I spoke. "I can't believe." Let me live this absurd dream. It can't be Wednesday. No chance. I will wake up. "I am sure." Then I put my phone in my left pocket and walked to that gas station just a few meters away from me. There were some people. Everyone was smiling. I was trying to talk to them. I couldn't. All I did was open my mouth. Nothing was possible. My feelings were really strange. It was the first time I felt like a ghost. Like someone who is there, next to you, but you can't hear him or even see him. Some people were buying drinks from the fridge. One was opened. I tried to get some water. I had never felt that thirsty before. A miracle occurred. 

I was able to open the bottle of water I took. Then I drank some. It was the best feeling of my life. Nothing was better before. I had really mixed feelings. After a few seconds, some parts of my memories flew in front of me. I wanted to go home. "Please." My anxiety was getting worse. It was getting much worse. I ran back to the car, opened it, and made it go full speed. My journey continued. "Okay, so... I am turning back on the next turn." Now it should be possible. There's no chance that I can't escape. "Everywhere and every time is a way to go back." Even if you made a really bad decision, the problem was that I did nothing. It just happened.

There it is. It was just the last two hundred meters before I turned back. I dreamt. One hundred meters... ten... five... three... I tried. I used all my energy to turn that wheel to the right, but something blocked that. I couldn't make a turn. I pushed the hand brake. Nothing happened. It was stuck. My car was still going in the same direction, with no change in speed. "Please, Mom. Dad? 

"Where are you?" That was the only thing happening in my head. My mind was out of this world. "PLEASEEEEEE. PLEASEEE." Then I said, "If it's just a dream, then I can crash and nothing will happen." "The only thing that can happen is that I will wake up from this incredible nightmare." I grabbed the wheel with both hands and then I heard something again. The voice of that man was, "Alex, do you really want to do that?" I wouldn't recommend you. Nothing will change. Crashing into a tree or anything else won't solve your problem. "Just find me, and then we can talk," he said and then disappeared. I don't care. You are just a man in my mind. "I won't listen to you." "I was screaming all the way I could, and then I did what I wanted to."

May 13, 2037: Another day is here. I was so happy when I woke up. That was a really bad and long dream. "Now let me go to school." But that day, something was wrong. It happened a second time. I grabbed my phone, opened the calendar, and it wasn't Monday morning. I don't know how, but it was Thursday. After that, I knew I was still in the dream. "What would happen if I went to school and behaved like I would on a normal day?" I was wondering. "There must be something that I can go around, like the point of the dream." It's all in my head. There's no one who is fighting with me; it's just me. My mind." I had to fight with myself. No one was at home in the morning. The house was all mine, but I didn't care. I changed my clothes, made breakfast, put my shoes on, and left the house. I unlocked the car, went inside, and tried to drive to the school. The traffic was really bad. There wasn't enough time to be at school on time. 

My first period was just math with a substitute, so it wasn't a huge problem, but the traffic was really bad. My speed was like the average velocity of a chill biker. The surroundings were changing all the time, like in a game. One thing was still the same. The road. But the people—that was so terrible. Most of them were honking all the time. Everyone was upset. I just wanted to have one morning with no stressful situations. There was so much pressure from all sides, and I was already twenty-five minutes from the school. I opened the maps on my phone. Something was wrong. Another time. I didn't even set the navigation, and my phone wanted to turn me back and go the same way I went some time ago. I didn't listen to my phone. 

This time I could go my way, and there weren't any blockades. I tried to pretend that I wasn't feeling so confused and didn't know what was happening around me. But one thing surprised me so much. I was completely free. The voice of that man wasn't talking to me. At least I didn't hear him. After thinking so much, I was almost at school. The traffic was getting smaller, and there were fewer cars on the road. Somehow, I made it to my final destination and parked my car, but one thing was scaring me. There was no one. only parking spots and the school. Zero people are around me. I have never felt like this before. alone without anyone. Or maybe yes, there were some situations in which I felt even worse. But still in this dream. My life was beautiful until this happened to me. 

I was thinking while I was walking to school. There were like five minutes left until the end of the period. I didn't go to the class because it wouldn't be worth it. I just waited on a bench in front of the classroom. The bell rang, but I was still sitting there because no one was leaving the room. I was wondering, "What's happening?" Please stop kidding me. "That's not a good joke." My tears were moving down my face, and then I saw my math teacher leaving the class. She wasn't in any mood, and she didn't even say hello or ask me how I was doing. 

That was very unusual for her. We had the best relationship between the student and the teacher. I left her alone. One thing was telling me that wasn't a dream, so I was falling into that. I couldn't defend myself. Someone wanted to destroy my life. I was pretty sure about that. The bell rang. Another period started. I used all my energy to go from one side of the school to the other side of the art class. Also, none of my friends or classmates are here, only me and my art teacher. She was behaving like a non-player character. The movements of her hands, legs, and whole body were strange. 

Everything was so strange. It wasn't only about the teachers. She told me to paint my ideal dream life. I took the brush and started with no colors because she didn't give me any. The only thing I was doing for like fifteen minutes was just moving the painting brush across the canvas. Then my teacher asked me how I was doing. I told her, “Come here, come look; that's a life I am dreaming about." "Oh, I see," she answered. The palms and the beach are looking wonderful; is that Hawaii or the Bahamas? Wait for what? That's me at home. Both of us saw that there was something we were thinking and dreaming about. I was wondering, "Why would she do that?" Wait, but there wasn't anything. It was blank, like the last days of my life. I asked her, "How?" What? I don't understand. 

"Please, isn't there anyone who can explain to me what's happening right now?" "Alex, I need to talk to you." Sometimes you might think the canvas is completely blank, with nothing painted on it, but it really isn't. It's about what you think, what you wonder about, and what you imagine at a particular time. You may think I am just a mad old woman getting paid to teach kids to paint. But remember my words. What I told you isn't just about the paintings. You can compare art to the real world. It's a method to show your impressions and feelings by saying anything. You can take as many people here as you want and ask them what they think about the painting you created. It's guaranteed that everyone will think and talk about very different things. "Some of them may talk about broken hearts, and some about happiness or an interesting life."

My art teacher's monologue impressed me so much. All the students, including me, thought that she was really strange just because of her looks. The way she was looking was kind of gray, with curly hair, circle glasses, and so many rashes on her face. Prejudices are the things that change our minds all the time, no matter what. By this time, I had started to understand how and why particular people behave and express their emotions. I also started to think that's not a dream; maybe that was all just in my head and I can't take the situations in real life; who knows? The bell rang. 

There was no time for more overthinking. I had to move ahead. "Thanks, Miss, thank you for everything," I said, and then I left the classroom. After this hour with my art teacher, I was entirely changed. Literally. Everything was different after that, but as I said, I had to move. Something in me told me to find that guy who was talking to me some time ago. I left the school. Nothing really matters. I thought. I came into my car and did something unexpected. Meadow was the word, the place, and the thing where I was lying all summer when I was finding answers and reasons why. 

This time, the road was perfectly clear. There was no one except me and my darling, my beautiful car. It really didn't take me so long to get to my favorite place on the side of our city, but at some point, the road ended. Dead ends meant so much to me because where some gates close, others are opened. I was full of interest, and I left the car without thinking about anything, and I kept the door open. That's how much I was engaged in that meadow. Also, there wasn't anyone. 

I used to be alone so many times. Then I remembered what my art teacher was talking about. Life isn't just about having a lot of money and being the favorite person of the people, you know. It's about something quite different. You will remember something. It's mostly about your family, and in thee second place are the memories. No wonder I enjoy laying on the grass next to a tree while watching the beautiful sky and its colors. Clouds probably interested me the most. Every time you look, they are quite different. The best thing about it is that they are never the same. 

Oh no, I think I am completely lost in my dreams. Why am I always thinking about things that are hard to believe?
Hey, Alex, don't you think you are lost? The voice appeared again. Wait, that's what I was wondering about
some moments ago. How? Tell me... How could you listen to my thoughts? You still don't know? "You are not ready to know the truth," the man said. Then he disappeared. My life was moved to another level of depth by being deceived. I won't listen to you; I don't even know you, old man. I had to move. not just staying and crying; that's not my style. I entered the car and looked at the navigation. It was still navigating me somewhere. a place where no one knew what it was. If I can't do anything, let's just follow the way my phone wants me to go. Nothing can be worse than now. 

Nothing. My life is going in both directions at the end, so why take care of that? I made it at full speed. Nothing really matters. My journey had officially started. The car's speed was almost at its maximum. It couldn't go any faster. I was laughing like never. I appeared to enjoy this vast, non-living life. The biomes were changing one by one every hour on my ride. After seven hours, I had to take some rest. I found a pull-in, where I stopped and took some rest. The state of Georgia was welcoming me. 

The weather was much worse than in Florida. After drinking some water, I continued on my dangerous ride. I had to find that guy, no matter what. My speed had no boundaries. Dangerous was the adjective that I could use as my new name. By that time, the sky had gotten really dark. It was around eleven at night. I really wanted to go to sleep. Really. just some rest. Again. But the thing was, there weren't any turns on the highway. I speeded even more than before. My darling was being used beyond its limits. Then that voice occurred another time. 

He said, "Speeding won't help you solve any of your problems." "I don't have any problems." I was living my best life before. Hey. Do you hear me? Give me it back. "I want to be back with my family, friends, and also my dog." That mysterious name spoke: "No." You need to find it yourself. As I told you before, no one can solve your problems. "That's all about you." "Can you at least please tell me your name?" I tried. "It has to be someone I know," I was wondering. "Alex, you should be more modest and polite." Change your way of living, and then I may tell you, my name. After that, he disappeared. Somehow, on the road, a turn appeared. I grabbed the wheel so hard and made it. The turn led to an abandoned motel. Everything looked so scary there, but I didn't have any other options, and I didn't want to sleep in the car, so I entered the building and stayed there for a night.
