**A wave tumbles playfully into my face, rocking me back and forth. The ocean bubbled in jubilation. I scanned the horizon in all directions and saw nothing but an endless expanse of water.** 

**Where am I?** 

**Who am I?**

**These questions lit my mind on fire and I racked my mind in search of an answer which could extinguish the flame but I found nothing and my mind remained inflamed as even more questions bubbled up, each more thought provoking than the last.**

**Water rose and fell all around me, my feet failed to brace against anything solid and salty water covered me completely, occasionally pulling my head under. The horizon remained equally empty in everyF direction consisting of nothing but an expansive ocean which seemed to consume everything in my sight.**

**I put my head below vigilantly observing the water which surrounded me. Through the darkness, I can vaguely see a sandy surface with a pattern carved by the flow of water deep below the surface. Stone cylindrical pipes spiraled out of the sand with twists and turns on its surface resembling a snake. The pattern in the sand remained undisturbed with nothing growing out of the ocean floor, and besides me, I saw no movement in the waters. I realized that there was no life here - no fishes, no coral, no algae… nothing. This ocean was abandoned, all life either jumped ship or didn’t exist here to begin with. The oddity of my situation puzzled me but I lacked the pieces to see the full picture. Above me, the desolate night sky was tall and distant. Stars were missing and the melancholy moon sat alone in a deserted sky.**

**A few days pass and during that time I wonder how I came to be here. I can’t find any memories in my head of a time before I had awoken here. I wonder if I have any loved ones, if so, did they miss me? Are they searching for me? I imagine the face of someone I love and see nothing in my head which makes me cry but the ocean wipes my tears for me.**

**Although I have not eaten for a few days I don’t feel hungry and even though there’s water surrounding me, I’ve not drank any nor do I feel thirsty.  The water gives me no moment to be still. A current or wave constantly rocks me. Perhaps the ocean is fearful that I may leave it too.**

**I’ve chased the horizon in every direction and found a disappointing amount of nothingness. The restless ocean has pushed me around constantly and I’ve not slept since I woke up - not like I feel tired enough to sleep in the first place. The moon sits unmovingly in the same spot every day. I’ve yet to see the sun rise -  is there even a sun here?**

**I’ve gotten much better at swimming because the ocean and I began playing together a lot more. If I tap my hand twice against the water, it would bring a wave that would sweep me away before crashing on my head. I would dive and the water would create a current around me that would propel me incredibly fast. Our playing lasted a few days.**

**The playful waves suddenly stopped and the music of water bubbling, rising and crashing was cut, creating a silence loud enough for me to hear a slight humming coming out from the water. I dived and swam in the direction of the hum which led me above one of the stone cylinders. Along the cylinder there were rocks which glowed with a dim shade of blue.**

**I’m drawn to the glowing rocks and my arms attempt to propel me in it’s direction but as I approach a pressure builds in my head. My skull feels like it’s being crushed and is moments away from shattering and reflexively, I resurface.** 

**Over a couple days the glowing intensifies and I’ve made attempts to get to it, resurfacing each attempt due to the same intense pressure. The lonely ocean remains silent and dejected. And I attempt to play again but the water ignores my attempts. A pain grows in my stomach, one which I recognise as hunger and my lips become cracked and rough from dryness.**

**The glowing intensifies more, and the audible hum becomes a shaking buzz. The glowing rocks beckons to me strongly and my attention becomes centered around the rocks alone. I try again to swim down but the pressure sends me back up again. My eyelids become heavier and my sluggish limbs begin to get cold.**

**Solemnly, the glowing rocks and I share glances, their look an inquisitive one almost as if asking, “Your time is almost up, what’s your move?” I knew my time was near its end, so in a final attempt, I pushed beyond the pressure. My head exploded with an almost crippling pain, the back of my eyes radiated pain through my face and my headache felt like my brain was being stabbed each time my heart beat. Each stroke was difficult, the water became viscous around my arms, increasing in viscosity by the second until it felt like swimming through molasses. My diaphragm began battling me, trying to force me to take a breath as my hollow lungs cried out from being stabbed with pins and needles.**

**Time was obscure but I eventually got close to the rocks. With my arms outstretched, I felt a comforting warmth penetrate my fingertips. The warmth grew my determination and with extreme difficulty, I made one final stroke and touched the rock with my fingertips and in an instant all of the pressure vanished, the pain was gone. I found myself at the surface of the water and I filled my lungs with air as soon as I could.** 

**In an instant I knew that everything was different. I saw cloudy skies, birds were singing, the ocean played joyfully, ignoring my presence this time. Looking under the water, I saw a school of fishes wandering around together, I saw calm jellyfishes floating carelessly and almost meditatively and I saw a shoreline not too far away from me.** 

**I swam over to the shoreline and in an instant a chubby carmel man with frizzy hair, wearing blue shorts ran up to me.**

* **“Roy, I’ve been looking everywhere for you man, where were you? Are you ok?” He asked, his voice high and frantic.**

**I didn’t respond, not aware that he’s speaking to me as I’ve still not remembered anything.**

* **“Holy shit, you look horrible! Your lips are all dried up and your skin looks  like you have been in the water for days - it’s soo wrinkly...”**

**At this point I pieced one and two together and realized he was talking to me.**

**This man turned out to be named James. We’ve been best friends since childhood but my memory has still not returned. I did have loved ones, and they did miss me. Doctors say that I have amnesia. I’ve also told them about the ocean but they’ve tried to convince me that it was a hallucination, but I can’t get that ocean out of my head, I think about it often. I wonder if it’s found any new friends or if it’s still alone.** 

**Sometimes I go back to the ocean that I resurfaced at and search for the rocks, but I never find them. My heart aches of guilt, having abandoned that ocean. I miss it, although there was nothing there but the water, within that endless expanse of water, there was peace.**
