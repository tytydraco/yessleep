Hi, everyone from the channel. My name is Luís… well, I’d rather not reveal my full name. I’ve been a subscriber for a while, and today I decided to share a story that still gives me chills every time I think about it. I’m a registered nurse now and currently work at a private hospital that’s part of a big network in my city. But back in 2014, I was just a nursing technician. I had just finished my vocational course, full of hope, resume in hand, walking all over town, dropping off paper wherever I could—clinics, private hospitals, tiny corner offices.

When I got a call for a temporary position at Santa Efigênia Public Hospital, I almost cried. It was an emergency contract, nothing solid, but with the night shift bonus, it was enough to pay rent on the small room I shared with a friend, buy food, and hold out until something better came along.

I started on a Monday in May. They put me on the 11 PM to 7 AM shift—the dreaded overnight. I was what they called a support tech, the go-to guy for everything. I’d run from one floor to another with medications, adjust oxygen levels, help transfer patients, change IV bags, check vitals—I didn’t stop. The hospital was old, built with 70s concrete, but it was still standing thanks to a handful of professionals who worked miracles with what little they had.

The first few nights were exhausting, but uneventful. Nights in a hospital are long. You start recognizing the sounds: the beeping of heart monitors, the echo of footsteps on cold tile floors, the muffled snores of patients in the hall. Sometimes the silence is so loud it feels like it’s screaming. And like every old building, Santa Efigênia had its creepy spots—creaky doors, flickering lights, footsteps where no one’s walking. You just learn to ignore it. Comes with the job.

But since my first night, something bothered me: the annex.
Behind the main hospital, separated by a covered walkway, was a smaller building. A two-story annex that used to house the old men’s ward, some observation beds, and the old pharmacy. All of that is now on the hospital’s top floor. The annex had been shut down for about two years after a fire. No one went in there anymore. The gate was sealed with a thick chain and two heavy padlocks. The sign, already faded by rain and time, read: “ANNEX – CLOSED OFF.”

It was weird thinking that, in a public hospital where space is always tight, a whole wing had been abandoned for so long.
But even closed off, it never felt truly deactivated.
At night, especially after 3 AM, it was common to hear creaking noises from that side. The janitor said it was the concrete settling. But I’d passed by and heard something else: a bed being dragged, a nurse call bell going off—other sounds.

One night, as I walked in for another shift, I looked at the rusted iron door of the annex and got the strange feeling something was behind it. It gave me chills.
In the main ward, the system showed all beds—occupied, free, being cleaned, etc.
And that night, at exactly 3:13 AM, a new admission popped up:

João Elias de Almeida – Bed 313.
But our hospital didn’t have a bed 313. The last one was 309.

I deleted the name. Thought it was a system glitch.
But the next night, same time, it came back.
I took out my phone, snapped a photo of the screen, and went straight to the night supervisor. She looked at it and took a deep breath.

“Just let it go, Luís. It’s happened before.”

“What do you mean?”

“We’ve already filed reports with I.T.… they say it’s an old bug. A database issue. Sometimes it pulls data from wings that don’t exist anymore. Just an old echo in the system.”

“Do you know who João Elias de Almeida is?” I asked.

She looked at me. Took a while to answer.

“It’s a public hospital, kid... what do you think?”

The third time it happened, the intercom rang. It was the front desk extension. But the screen said: EXTENSION 313.

I answered. Silence. Then—labored breathing, like someone out of breath. I hung up immediately.

Next shift, while sipping weak coffee in the cafeteria, old Mr. Silvio—the night security guard—started talking to me. He caught me staring at the hospital floor plan on the tiled wall.

“You’re curious about the annex, huh?” he asked, straight to the point.

I nodded, a bit sheepishly. He sighed.

“That place caught fire one night two years ago. Started on the top floor, the men’s ward. They said it was an electrical short in one of the rooms, but no one really believes that. Two patients died. And the weird thing… was the condition of the bodies.”

Silvio looked down, as if reliving the moment. Then continued:

“I was here that night. One of the first on the scene when the alarm went off. The smell of smoke was intense. The fire had already taken most of the men’s ward. The extinguishers weren’t enough. Firefighters arrived quickly, managed to get almost everyone out. All but two patients.”

He paused, gripping his paper cup tightly.

“When the firefighters found the bodies… one of them was untouched. The bed was intact. No soot, no burns. Not even the sheet was scorched. But the smell… it was like burnt death. Like the fire had happened inside him.”

I tried to laugh, call it an urban legend, but I choked when I heard the name of the dead: João Elias de Almeida.

Silvio squinted, like he was watching the scene all over again. His cup trembled, spilling coffee over the sides. He didn’t even notice.

“I saw him,” he whispered, like afraid someone else might hear. “Not back then. Months later. Maybe five months after the fire.”

I sat up straighter, trying to act skeptical. But my skin was crawling.

“I was walking down the main hallway, coming back from X-ray. Another quiet night. Just the hum of the A/C. Then I saw someone walking slowly, his back to me. Wearing a hospital gown, thinning hair. Barefoot. Looked lost.”

Silvio looked sideways, like watching the hallway again.

“I called out. ‘Sir, are you okay?’ Nothing. He just kept walking. But the way he moved... it was weird, like his feet touched the floor but didn’t really step. Like he was gliding.”

“You followed him?” I asked.

He nodded.

“When I turned the corner, he was gone. But the floor was stained. Like someone had just come from a coal furnace. Footprints. And they ended in the middle of the hallway. Just stopped. And that smell—” he wrinkled his nose, “the same as during the fire. Smoke and burnt flesh.”

I stayed quiet, a bitter taste rising in my throat. Silvio set his cup down, like he’d said what he needed to.

One time, I saw it with my own eyes.
It was a night like any other. The system beeped. “BED 313” lit up on the screen. And I decided to go to the annex.

I left my station, walked down the cold corridor. Outside, the sky was clear, no wind. But the hall to the annex felt freezing.
The gate was ajar. The chain on the floor. No padlock.
I pushed it open slowly. The building was fully lit inside. Like it was working. Fluorescent lights buzzing. The hallways were clean, like freshly mopped. The smell… that old hospital smell.

The annex elevator was working. The panel lit up. I went up to the top floor.
The doors opened with a dry clack.

In the middle of the hallway stood a hospital bed with a sheet over it. I walked toward it. My whole body shook with each step.

On the ID tag, it read:
BED 313
The sheet moved. Like someone was breathing underneath it.

With a trembling hand, I pulled it off in one go.
No one there. But the mattress was sunken, like someone had been lying there.

Footprints on the floor led to the wall. And vanished.

I ran to the elevator. It wouldn’t move.
I was stuck there for almost ten minutes. The bed stood between me and the stairs. I didn’t dare cross.

When I finally made it down, I went straight to the main ward. Grabbed my stuff, turned in my badge, and quit right there, hands still shaking.
The supervisor didn’t even ask why. She just looked at me and nodded—like she already knew.

In the following days, I tried to forget. Told myself it was exhaustion, lack of sleep, the pressure of night shifts. But something kept bothering me, nagging in the back of my mind: what really happened in that hospital all those years ago?

I did some digging on my own. Looked through public archives and found an old newspaper article.
The fire at the hospital killed two men.
One of them was João Elias de Almeida.
The other… was Silvio da Costa.

I just stared at the screen for a few minutes. Same face. Even the badge was visible, pinned to the burned uniform in the photo. Same security outfit. Same tired eyes.

I had spent months talking to a ghost.
A dead man.
A lingering echo of what remained in that old wing of the hospital.
