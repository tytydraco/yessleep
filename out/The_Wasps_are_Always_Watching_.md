So, I'm not going to get into great detail about my life, as it's just semi-relevant to the experience that the past few years have been. Let's just say I've had an abusive childhood, and an unstable life for the majority of it, which caused me to dissociate from it, and tunnel vision focus on other things around me. 


One particular fascination, insects and spiders. The laws of insects just doesn't seem to apply to the laws of humans. Their social structure, hierarchy, physics, life cycle, reproduction, etc. Everything is different, though it appears humans have tried to adopt some of their knowledge and attempt to replicate it with technology. 


They're smarter than us, more advanced than us, even outnumber us. Not a lot of people like hearing or accepting that, but it's true. 


My particular fascination with predatory insects, started with a spider. One morning I woke up and saw it on my window. Dew drops decorating an elaborate web with a zig zag design. Macrame, just like the owl macrame my grandmother made for us to hang.


The spider itself, looked frightening, but gorgeous. Her black and yellow body with unique little designs. Shiny spindly legs delicately holding onto this web, whereas a human holding that position would certainly struggle and fail. They have to eat too. I realized this as I witnessed a moth get stuck in the web and the spider capture it. 


For that reason, I've used them as natural pesticides in my homes and gardens as an adult. Same with mantis. I adore those with their cute swivel heads, like E.T. 


I generally leave predator bugs alone, as long as they're not aggressive. Very few people can tolerate living with me due to this. Spiders set up camp in a small corner of my room? To me, it's a blessing. Someone built a home next to my dish rack? Awesome! Catch those ants for me please. 


Having dealt with roach problems before, I found mantis are best for that, but those guys are so hard to find. So when I find one, I spoil the Hell out of it. It gets it's own window, houseplant that's misted multiple times per day, and free range of the house plus outside time. 


Which brings me to now. Still have a huge spider chilling in my bathroom. I figure, if there wasn't something for it to eat, it wouldnt keep building it's webs in that spot. Same with the big girl by my kitchen window. 


A problem I ran into here in my new place though, was yellow jackets. They were getting into the foundation and very vicious. I could be sitting around the corner about 50ft away from their nest and they would start getting all up in my face trying to be all intimidating. 


They never stung me, but I couldn't help but feel like they were testing my boundaries and pretty much trying to provoke me to swat at them or get me to run away all scared for a laugh. I was getting quite annoyed with them. 


I was stubborn though. As I sat on my front porch, complete opposite side of my house from the stupid yellow jackets one day, I started resenting the fact that I avoid my favorite part of the outside over a bunch of territorial assholes. I was willing to be peaceful. I didn't bother them. Like I said, I generally live and let live unless it's some invasive pest species IN my house. 


Just then as I was taking a drink of my water, a wasp landed on my porch table. It looked very tired, but it was looking at me. I was thinking, "Great, the last thing I need is to be ran off of my front porch too!" Yet, as I slowly placed my cup down, it watched that, then looked back at me. For a brief moment, I understood. 


I took a bottle cap sitting on the table and filled it with some of my water, and slowly put it near the wasp. It immediately went to it and guzzled down for a good solid minute. It started to look much better, and quickly flew off. Cool! I understood a wasp.


So I thought. I started walking around to the back of my house where the yellow jackets were, to contemplate my best course of action to get rid of these thugs, and noticed a couple of wasps swarming around me. 


A sarcastic "great", I uttered out. Thinking there were more wasps than just the one that I helped bf I must have pissed it off and walk past IT'S home or something. However, they weren't swarming AT me like the yellow jackets do.


I stand there, feeling defeated at this point. Staring at the swarm of yellow jackets, pouring out of a ventilation hole in my crawl space by the hundreds. The wasps flying nearby, watching me... 


But... then I see two dark red bodies fly to the wall close to the yellow jackets nest. Then a few more come, then a whole pack. It was wasps. What I watched transpire, was absolute chaos. The wasps went to war with these yellow jackets. I didn't get close enough to see what exactly they were doing to them, but soon I just saw little red wasps and only a couple yellow stragglers.


I was absolutely flabbergasted and thought this nothing short of a miracle of true understanding between two completely different creatures. I sat out some water and fruit exactly in the same spot that I stood, and went inside for the night. 


I didn't see any wasps the next day, and I was kind of sad thinking they possibly may have died fighting those yellow jackets, but delayed perhaps?


The following day, there was the start of a small wasp nest on both corners of my front porch. This made me happy. Wasps are territorial as well, but in general, if they don't feel threatened, you really won't have to worry about them. I've made this a strict role for visitors, to leave my wasps alone. Just ignore them. Don't swing at them. Don't try to knock down their nests. 


The nests have grown and spread over the years. You would probably be as shocked as everyone else is, the first time you see them. You're thinking, maybe one or two little wasp nest right? Not a whole community. Well, it is. 


As you can imagine, people who visit usually have a huge problem with this. So in turn, I've studied greatly, into wasps. They're actually a sought after pollinator. All wasps are predatory, either by means of diet, territory, or even by reproduction. By reproduction, think about the Alien movies by Ridley Scott. 


They're generally not aggressive with humans unless they get scared. Just treat them with respect because, here's the REAL fun fact... They recognize faces! 


They have brain cells dedicated to facial recognition that processes the faces of their peers and even humans, just like primates do. They can read emotion on your face as well as smell your pheromones. And... The can process all faces at once! Which means they can point out a face they recognize in a crowd. 


They also associate some faces and smells, with either reward or bad experience. So that probably explains why they attacked those yellow jackets. They didn't even build their nests anywhere near the yellow jackets' nest. It sounds delusional, I know, but I've gained a whole respect for my wasp neighbors.


I stop and admire them every day. They're always watching. I walk in and out of my front door multiple times per day, and see hundreds of little faces pointing directly at me. I take it as their "hello, how are you?" They do on on alert when someone new shows up or someone who doesn't visit frequently. I'll notice one or two watchers from every colony pop out about 2 ft in front of their nest. 


I'll remind the visitor to just be cool and they'll leave them alone. So far, everyone has respected them, though disgruntled about it. One, in particular, was my ex. He constantly griped about how I need to knock their nests down and get rid of the damn things. Mind you, they were never flying around, they just stayed on their nests. Luckily, he never swung at them. 


We eventually broke up. He cheated. Though, ironically, HE didn't take the breakup well. Months later, after not talking to him at all because I blocked him, he showed up randomly in the middle of the night. Like 3am... He was drunk and belligerent. "it was a mistake! You're really going to give up on us over this? I bet you have a man in there with you right now you whore!"


I didn't come out, didn't even come to the door. I watched him from my ring camera, until he finally gave up and started walking down the ramp of my porch, to his car. Right as he was almost to his car, he yelled out, "I better never see you or with another man, I'll kill him and you both! I swear on my life!"


Suddenly, I started seeing hundreds of white bodies fly across my screen with the night vision ring camera. Oh crap... I turned on the speaker for my camera and yelled at him to run. The dumb ass wouldn't. Him finally hearing my response, he started coming back up the ramp giving me a piece of his mind. The wasps dove in on him. 


He started swatting, cussing, running off to his car and finally peeling out of my driveway. I ran to my door and watched from the door window as the wasp swarm started to return and calm down. I slowly opened the door. They all, collectively, went back to their nests, and turned to look at me. Hundreds of shiny little black eyes.


He lived through the attack. I know this because two days later he made an alt account to message me, "I told you that you need to do something about your damn wasps. You're lucky I don't sue!" 


Nah.. I think I'll keep them. My Army, my friends. The wasps are ALWAYS watching...
