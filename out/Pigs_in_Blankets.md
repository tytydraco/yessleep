On Christmas Eve of 2023, a mantle of black vapour blew into our village from a strange storm above a nearby coastal town. *It’s happening again*, was all Harold managed to say as hell rode on a powerful gust into our village. My old neighbour scampered into his house, and I followed his lead. I felt lucky for managing to retreat indoors before breathing or blinking in any of those dark watery particles.

After all, most villagers met horrible fates upon doing so.

I witnessed something beyond explanation; and I saw a ghost when I was a young boy, so I’d long believed in the existence of the paranormal. Spirits and others planes of existence. But I’d never believed in anything like this smog which was drowning my village in black. Plaguing my neighbours and friends. Turning them against one another. Painting their faces with black veins and putting monstrous words on their tongues. They spoke vile things as they pulled one another apart with fingers and teeth.

But those of us who stayed out of the black smog were not as lucky as we imagined.

I was chased out of my home by infected neighbours. They battered down my front door and shrieked that they would rip me apart, sending me scarpering into the night; a winter shawl knotted around my face to prevent me from inhaling the black substance hanging thickly in the air. I dashed through my back garden and skirted around the edge of my neighbourhood back to a street filled with smog and violence. Then I darted for Harold’s side gate, ignoring the screeches coming from the black mist, and I ran headfirst into my uninfected neighbour, Jane, on the old man’s front lawn; she had the same idea as me.

See, Old Man Harold was a known doomsday prepper. He had spent years kitting out his parents’ Second World War shelter at the back of his property, and the man chewed off townsfolk’s ears by nattering about it at any opportunity. Well, it seemed a few villagers had paid attention to the old man over the years because Jane and I ran down the side of Harold’s house to find two others in the garden, banging on the door of his bunker, half-submerged into the garden. Millie, the corner shop girl, and Ruben, a family lawyer.

All four of us were covering our faces and shouting for the old man to let us in. Then there came the grinding of metal and a muffled voice, and the bunker door swung open to reveal a stern-faced Harold decked out in a gas mask and a hazmat suit.

“Shut up and get down here, or they’ll find us!” Harold ordered.

The four of us scurried through the doorway and down the stairs into the bunker as Harold pulled the metal door shut behind us. Inside was not a rusting and dilapidated shelter from the Second World War, but a refurbished fortress with soundproofed walls of steel reinforced concrete. The bunker was ten metres in length and four in width, with a bunk bed up against one side wall and shelves of supplies against the other. A wide sofa sat against the far wall, and a dining table stood in the centre of the room.

“Two of you in the bunk. One of you on the sofa… Someone will have to make do with a sleeping bag on the floor, and I’ll join ‘em. I’ve got plenty of supplies, but we might struggle down here with five people,” said Harold. “Took three weeks for the vapour to pass last time.”

“Last time?” Ruben replied.

Harold nodded. “Aye. Every twenty years, a dead rainbow hangs over the coast, bringing black rain and a person’s worst self.”

“How do you know all this?” I asked.

He held his head in shame. “Because I lived there most of my life. Saw it strike that town two times, but I… I ran away the third time. The last time. I ran here.”

“Didn’t run far, did you?” Ruben scoffed.

Harold shook his head. “I suppose I always wanted to keep my old stomping ground within reach. That town is a special place. Sure, this village is idyllic enough, but you don’t understand. My old home was—*is* a paradise. The 20-year reaping is a small price to pay. The older folk around these parts understand that. Most of them flee when they sense the storm approaching.”

“It wasn’t enough of a paradise for you to stick around, was it?” Ruben said. “And I wouldn’t call any of this a small price. I saw… I saw Mrs Craw *eat* Mr Craw’s face.”

Harold nodded solemnly. “Well, you’re safe now. Come. Sit at the table. We’ll eat well tonight, and then we’ll start rationing tomorrow.”

“Three weeks down here…” gulped Millie. “Maybe we should just make a run for one of our cars? Drive out of the village.”

“Too many of those fuckers out there,” said Ruben.

Harold nodded. “And you’d have to drive three miles out before getting clear of this. But maybe you’d make it. You’re free to try. The door’s right there.”

“Let’s just regroup,” suggested Ruben. “We’ll eat some food, get some sleep, and decide what we ought to do in the morning. I vote we stay until the smog clears, but… who knows? Maybe there’ll be an opening for us to escape tomorrow.”

“Maybe,” Harold said, but it was an old man’s maybe; one that says, *I’ve been around longer than you and know better*.

The doomsday prepper lit a tall candle at the centre of the table, then fetched canned lentils and rice. The old man then handed them out to each of us at the table and apologised for not having plates, as space was limited in his bunker. None of us were complaining; not aloud, anyway. We had food in our bellies. We had shelter from the horrors of the fighting villagers above. We were fortunate. But something wasn’t quite right.

I just didn’t know what.

I knew only that my head was throbbing, and my eyes were being continually drawn back to the entrance of the bunker at the top of the tall staircase. In that cramped space, lit only by a single swinging bulb above our heads, everything seemed black and shaded; but the barrier between us and the outside world seemed blackest of all. A blackness painful to eyeball, yet I didn’t look away.

I don’t know how long I was absent-mindedly staring at that door, but I tuned back into the conversation to find an argument breaking out.

“… just bad people,” Ruben finished. “They were bad before this black smog infected them.”

“Don’t be so cruel. We’d be just the same as them if we’d inhaled it,” argued Millie.

“No, we wouldn’t,” Ruben said. “We’re good people with morals. With decency. The Craws were bigots. Fascists. Ugly stuff came out of their mouths long before the rain, or smog, or vapour put ugly words in their mouths.”

“Okay, but… they’re still people!” Millie protested.

“Not anymore,” interjected Harold. “Listen, sweetheart…”

“Don’t ‘sweetheart’ me,” she huffed.

Harold rolled his eyes. “Millie, if you want to make a break for it in the morning, I won’t stand in your way. Maybe the light of day will make a getaway easier. Maybe not. The black rain clouds the sky at all hours, from my memory. But if you *do* go out there tomorrow, you’ll need to realise that those things aren’t your neighbours or friends anymore. They’re not the villagers you used to know. They’re possessed.”

Then an added layer of strangeness unfolded.

“*Terrorists?*” Millie asked with eyes swollen; and voice too, as if something were lodged in her throat.

Harold frowned. “What? No… I think you misheard—”

“You old bastard!” growled Millie, seeming changed. “I don’t care if things were different back in your day. There’s no need to call our neighbours ‘terrorists’. No need to bring race into this. The Craws are good people. The colour of their skin doesn’t matter.”

I was so confused. Harold and I shared a look of concern, but Jane and Ruben seemed disinterested in this bizarre miscommunication between the old man and the young shop worker. They were tucking into their lentils and rice with eyes downwards. There was a pummelling behind my eyes, as if someone were trying to chisel through my brow, and my focus kept returning to the dark bunker door deeply entrenched within the shadows.

“Millie,” I started, “Harold didn’t say whatever you think he said… Are you feeling okay?”

Harold shook his head at me as if to say not to bother, then he stood up from his chair. “I think I’ll just head to bed, Eric. Tensions are high tonight. We aren’t in our right minds.” The old man slipped off to the corner of the room, presumably to fetch his sleeping bag.

*Right minds*.

Those words replayed in my own not-right mind.

“You should leave Harold alone,” Ruben said, looking up from his meal and locking eyes with Millie. “The old man saved us, you ungrateful bitch.”

I raised my hands, which felt weak and limp even with a full-ish meal in my stomach. “Calm down, Ruben.”

Millie gasped. “What did you just call me?”

“Nothing as terrible as what you called Harold,” spat Ruben. “His family died in the holocaust, and you’re really going to use bigoted slurs like that?”

*Bigoted slurs?* I frowned. Millie had neither said nor implied anything of the sort\*. What is happening?\*

More chiselling behind my brow. And the shadowed recesses of the bunker were seeming deeper, darker, and longer by the second. Tendrils of shade were slinking across the ceilings like vines over a trellis, reaching towards the lightbulb at the centre.

My head wasn’t working. It was in too much pain.

*Wrong*. That was all I managed to think. *This is wrong*.

Millie ran away from the table in tears, broken so deftly by Ruben, and the young shop worker clambered into the top bunk at the side of the room.

“That’s just like you,” scoffed Jane at Ruben disapprovingly.

I tried to look at her, but my eyes were welling with tears, and the room was blurring.

“What’s just like me?” he asked.

“To virtue signal,” she answered. “To pretend to care about Harold and his family’s heritage. All you really care about is tearing down Millie. Tearing down a young woman, you chauvinistic pig.”

Ruben rolled his bloodshot eyes. “It has nothing to do with her gender. She’s just an idiot. A bigoted idiot.”

“And so are you,” hissed Jane. “A woman-hating bastard. I hope you die sad and alone, you fuck.”

“Whatever,” grumbled Ruben, standing up. “I’m going to bed.”

Then only Jane and I were at the table.

I didn’t want to do it. I didn’t want to do what the others had done. But as I wiped away the tears from my eyes and blinked in an attempt to see clearly in that shadowy shelter, I turned to face my neighbour. My friend.

“Jane,” I said, “why? I didn’t expect that from you.”

She scowled at me, eyes red and face pale. “Oh. Standing up for your fellow man, are you? Part of the boys’ club, eh?”

“No,” I wheezed, finding myself unable to breathe. “I… I can’t…”

“Can’t what?” murmured Jane in a new voice; whispery, and slight, and not-quite-there.

I rubbed my eyes fiercely with my sleeve, and when I opened them, the overhanging lightbulb seemed blindingly bright for a moment.

Then I saw everything.

Clearly.

I caterwauled at the sight around the dining table. None of the guests had left for bed. Harold, Millie, and Ruben were still sitting in their seats. But they weren’t moving. Weren’t breathing. They were nude corpses sitting with heads rolling back across their headrests, and the bare skin they wore, from the neck down, was not their own; Millie’s flayed flesh blanketed Ruben’s own flayed body, and Old Man Harold’s flayed and wrinkled flesh blanketed *Millie’s* flayed body. Each corpse was swaddled in skin not belonging to it.

Harold was different. He had been the first casualty in the chain, so he wore no flesh on his mutilated body below the throat; instead, a yellowy underlayer of hypodermis was displayed.

Worse yet, and impossibly so, he was still alive.

“Cold…” he wheezed at me, bloodshot eyes boring into my own as he massaged his flayed flesh with degloved hands.

I remembered the truth of it. Harold had been mauled by Millie. Millie had been mauled by Ruben. Ruben had been mauled by Jane. And I was supposed to maul Jane. I felt the calling to do it. Felt something worming into my mind. We weren’t infected with the black vapour in our veins, but that didn’t mean we were *in our right minds*, as Harold had put it.

I realised what my subconscious had been trying to tell me.

*Something was in the bunker with us*.

Something in the corner of the room.

I could see it dancing around the outline of Jane’s body, as if puppeteering her from the shadows. Puppeteering her from whichever dimension it came. As Jane eyed me coldly and unseeingly, I knew that she wasn’t behind those eyes; and I knew also that there was no hiding from the dead rainbow or its black vapour. Good person. Bad person. It didn’t matter. It had come for us all.

“I guess if you don’t want to wear me,” whispered Jane in a fractured voice, as she rose shakily to her feet, “then I’ll have to wear you, Eric. And then comes the feast.”

Her hands were swift, clawing at me as if she were an animal. I cried out in agony as her nails lashed my face, scarring me, and I threw myself backwards in terror, with arms sprawling outwards; in turn, knocking the candle over. That tall candle with its long wick. It made quick work of setting the table, the bunk beds, and the sofa alight.

Far too quick work.

Unnatural work, like everything else. The fire spread as rapidly as the unnatural vapour through our town and the black shadow through our bunker. There were no rhyme or reason to the blaze. But I was thankful for this. Thankful as Jane and Harold were engulfed by flames, despite neither of them letting out cries of pain. They would die, and I would be safe. That was all I thought as I staggered backwards through the bunker.

Millie and Ruben were already long dead, of course, but the flames roasted them all the same. And as I backed up the stairs, too afraid to look away from the possessed form of my once-friend, there came one last frightening spectacle. Jane and Harold were still, impossibly, alive; and she was peeling strips of her cooking flesh from her alight body, before wrapping them around the old man’s charred and fleshless form.

“Thank you,” I heard Harold whisper as I opened the bunker door.

The blazing man thanked the blazing girl for coating him in her own flesh as the pair of them burnt alive.

I ran out into the garden, returning to a night of black vapour, and bloodshed, and screaming. It’s a miracle I didn’t inhale any of the smog myself, and a greater miracle that I escaped the burning bunker before the thing inside managed to crawl into my mind. At least, that’s what I tell myself. *I got out in time*.

Truthfully, however, I don’t remember the following month. Don’t remember what I did as I waited out the black smog from the dead rainbow. I like to imagine I hid from the monsters outside. Hid from the flaming wreckage of the bunker at the bottom of the garden, which only fully extinguished two days later. Another impossibility. The only memory I have is one of fear when the flames fully died out, because that plunged the outer world fully into darkness. There was no longer anything to see from Harold’s windows. Just black and more black.

There is a blank spot in my memory. I woke on the floor of Harold’s bathroom in January of 2024 to find sunlight pouring in through the window. The black vapour had cleared, and there were no corpses in the street. Signs of destructed property, but no bloodshed. The few villagers who survived told me they had watched the monsters become vapour themselves and transcend into the sky, perhaps readying themselves to return in another twenty years.

But our village has not returned to being idyllic in the meantime. Maybe Harold’s old coastal town is different, but I doubt it. There is no such thing as “utopia”. There is no joy to be found in those quiet periods between the horrors. There is no such thing as forgetting. Not really.

I know that, like me, the other surviving villagers are simply choosing not to remember.

We’re choosing to believe that we did not, for weeks on end, become monsters too. But we did. I know we did. We didn’t become infected and disappear into the sky with the rest of the vaporised monsters, but we became monstrous all the same; controlled by whatever darkness I saw down in that bunker. Whatever darkness slipped through cracks in the reinforced door and hid in the shadows among us, driving us to tear into one another.

The other villagers will have stories like mine. Stories of a thing that stole their bodies to commit terrible and terrifying atrocities until the black vapour finally lifted. You see, what I keep trying to forget, most of all, is Harold’s bathroom.

I woke on the floor surrounded by blood, and grime, and strips of flesh. Some of the filth was on my clothes and under my nails.
