"What?" Chris responded in a raspy, tired voice. "What forest? Why?" He added after a moment.

"Grab your gun too." I grabbed my keys and headed for the safe in my closet.

"My gun? Are we hunting?" He sounded confused.

"For protection." After inputting the combination, I grabbed my gun, ammunition and my gun holster.

"Protection?" Chris said in disbelief. "Dude what's going on?" His voice was clearer now.

"It's-" I paused, searching for the right thing to say. How would he react if I tried to tell him the truth? To explain what was happening? I'd sound like a crazed man. My wife already thinks I'm a nutjob.

"Complicated, I'll try to explain it in person, there's no time now." I finished speaking and quickly descended the stairs. A sigh resounded from the receiver. "Meet me near my grandmother's place, but make sure she doesn't see you."

"When? When are we meeting?" Chris sounded impatient, maybe upset.

"See you in thirty minutes." After hanging up the phone I began walking towards the kitchen, I could hear hushed whispers inside.

"*on't tell daddy okay?*"

I peered inside, Liam was nodding to my wife, Alice.

"What's going on here?" I announced my presence. Alice's eyes showed a momentary glint of surprise, before she composed herself.

"Nothing, I'm helping Liam with his legos." She answered, Liam wasn't looking at me, his eyes were fixed to the floor.

"I heard you." I said, trying to gouge out Alice's reaction. She showed none.

"Heard what?" Her eyes narrowed and she scratched her head, trying to look oblivious.

"Don't tell me what?" She bit her lip. Liam shuddered.

I slowly aproached my wife and son, but stopped when Alice took a step back. Her hands looked shaky. *Was she afraid of me?*

I took a deep breath and turned back around and began walking out. "I'm leaving, I'll be back by dinner." After one last glance towards the open kitchen doorway, I bolted out the front door and into my car. So many things were running through my head right now, I just sat there, taking steady breaths.

I lifted up my shirt to inspect my chest. There were no scars, no stitches, nothing. My organs were there, otherwise I wouldn't be alive. I wouldn't be breathing, I wouldn't be feeling my rapid heart beat.

*How did I get them back? How did I survive? How was I even alive without them? Iris said it took all of them.*

After switching the car into gear, I began driving to my destination.

A short fifteen minute drive later, I parked a couple blocks down from my grandmother's house. I sat there just waiting impatiently, tapping my fingers on the steering wheel. Then I felt something in my jacket's pocket. It was hard, rectangle shaped, and thin like paper. I carefully pulled it out of my pocket, only to sigh a sigh of relief when I realised it was just a business card. It was grey with a familiar face decorating it.

"Private detective Lucifer." Was written on the back in big red letters, and under that a number to call. It looked too simple to be a business card. How did it get into my pocket?

With some spare time to kill before Chris arrives, I decided to call him.

One ring later, someone picked up. "Hello?" His deep voice called out.

"Hello, this is Marc? We met-" I began saying, but he interrupted me.

"I've been waiting for your call, Marc." He spoke slowly, as if I were a five year old.

"Waiting? Why?"

After a pause, he spoke again. "You're in danger."

"Danger? What danger?" I hoped he wouldn't hear the desperation in my voice.

"The offic-" He began speaking, but a knock at the driver side window startled me. It was Chris.

"I have to go." I said into the receiver and hung up before he could say another word. I'm tired of everybody telling me that I'm in danger, I have a gun, if anybody tries something, they're the ones that are in danger.

I climbed out of my car and locked it behind me. I greeted Chris with a hug and I began leading him towards the forest.

"So? Will you begin explaining?" He was a couple feet behind me, I could feel his eyes piercing daggers at the back of my head. What was I supposed to tell him? I didn't know. I couldn't think. And then it clicked to me. Everything sounds crazy- out of this world, except the bodies that I found in the basement of that cabin. That was real.

"On thursday, I ventured out into the woods, to that old cabin behind my grandmother's house." I let the words speak for themselves. "It had collapsed in on itself, but there was a basement. A foul stench was coming from inside."

After a glance back, just to make sure he was still following behind me, I continued. "There were bodies, body parts." My phone buzzed in my pocket. I ignored it.

"Marc- jesus man." Chris whistled.

"Do you remember when I went missing? Twenty years ago?"

"yeah?" He replied with a hint of a question on his lips.

"I think.. that whoever did that, they took me." We finally arrived at a drive in into the forest, the road goes about a half a dozen miles deep to a park ranger's cabin. If you want to camp out here, you have to let them know.

"Is that why we're going to the forest? Surely you don't think they're still out there?"

To answer his question, I began explaining. "Of course I called the police, and once they got there, the basement had collapsed too. The strangest thing was, there was no sign of dead bodies or any organs, the only thing that remained was the stench of rotting bodies."

I glanced back, Chris gulped his saliva. "So what? We're here to hunt them? Is it them? As in multiple? or is it it?"

I shook my head. "I don't know."

"Shouldn't we leave this to the police? I mean we're not equiped for this-"

"Just- just trust me this once, please." I interrupted him. No matter how much I wanted to tell him the real reason why we're here, I couldn't. I could only pray we wouldn't encounter whatever was lurking in this cursed forest.

After a quiet five minute walk down the road, we plunged into the trees, not following any marked path.

We were both on high alert from the get go and my hand was on my holstered gun at all times.

It was still fairly early in the morning, my face was basked in the streaks of warm sunlight that got through the tree tops. Birds were chirping all around us.

However, the deeper we ventured, the quieter it got. We made small talk along the way, and I could tell Chris was stressed. He didn't like any of this. Maybe I shouldn't have lied to him, although it technically wasn't a lie.

After about half an hour we stopped at a clearing to take a breather. My legs had begun aching, walking through a forest is no easy task when you're a trained keyboard warrior. My profession is programming, I rarely go out.

"How long are we going to wander in here?" Chris asked, he wasn't tired, but I could guess he also didn't expect to spend his sunday morning wandering through a forest.

"Until we find what I'm looking for." I responded.

"Man, we have no water, no food, no supplies, and we keep going deeper." Chris sighed.

"We'll get lost." He's right, I know he is. But still, I can't just leave empty handed. It's like my spirit is being pulled into the forest, I don't know when I got this strong urge to learn, to understand what happened to me.

I made a decision then, "You can go man, I won't force you to come along."

Chris looked at me wide eyed, like I had just cursed him out. "I'm not going to leave you alone."

He stood up and took a deep breath.

"But if we get lost, I'll kill you myself." We both laughed at that.

I stretched my arms to the sky. "Alright let's keep walking." Chris nodded and we walked side by side, the mood now much lighter between us.

We hadn't realised when the forest grew silent. Each twig snapping and leave crunching appeared to be much louder than before. The birds had grown silent too, as if the slightest sound made would mean their death.

"Do you hear that?" I ask chris.

"Hear what?" He glanced at me, his eyes betraying a glint of confusion.

"The birds."

"What birds?"

"They're gone." He looked around us and listened in.

"You're right." We both stopped in our tracks and thats when I felt it. A presence, it felt hostile. My hair stood on end and my muscles tightened.

"Do you feel it?" I asked Chris.

His hand was over his gun. "Yeah."

We were both on high alert, looking around for whatever was stalking us. "We should move." Chris whispered into my ear. "Yeah."

Our feet slowly carried us through the forest for what felt like hours. The feeling of being watched- of being stalked never disappeared. It only grew in intensity the deeper we ventured. I fliched at the slightest sounds, pointing my gun in that direction, but I wasn't able to spot anyone or anything that could've made those sounds.

Have you ever been in such a overwhelming situation that it felt like you were on the verge of an anxiety attack? That's how I felt in that moment. My hands were shaky and my palms sweaty. I don't know why I was so afraid of what I couldn't see, but I could feel it. And it made shiver.

"What's that?" I looked to where Chris was pointing.

It was a staircase. A staircase in the middle of the fucking woods, leading up to nowhere. I swallowed hard. This is what I came here for. "Let's check it out." I whispered back to him, and we slowly inched towards it. It looked like concrete, taken straight out of an apartment complex, only about a dozen steps. The last step looked like a platform of sorts, but there were no more stairs that would connect to it.

I heard a faint growl a couple of yards behind us. "Did you hear that?" Chris was panicking.

We both stood still as statues as we looked towards the direction that the growl came from. And then it finally showed itself.

It stepped out from behind a tree that was much to small to hide it's large and tall body. At first glance it looked like a wolf/bear hybrid that stood on its back paws, but the more I stared at it, the worse its appearance got.

In place of what should be paws, were human like hands covered in scales, with long and sharp claws instead of nails. I would've called it a skinwalker if not for the two large horns portuding from the sides of its head, like a bull.

It had dark red eyes, which started at us intently, instilling fear into our souls, it's head resembled a snake, with a long flexible neck covered in scales.

It's body was half covered by fur, and half by scales which looked hard enough to reflect bullets. It wasn't only standing on what appeared to be its back paws, it was walking towards us, as if trying to immitate us.

It sped its pace up. "Chris, RUN!" I yelled at him and began sprinting towards the staircase.

A moment later I heard a gunshot and another growl, louder than the last one. I glanced back, Chris had shot at it. It was completely unharmed.

"Chris!" I screamed at him. He turned around and bolted towards me.

The thing behind us growled again, after another quick glanced to make sure Chris was following me, I noticed that the creature was running towards us on all fours. It's human like hands with claws had transformed into paws.

The staircase was just another yard away. When I got to it, I took the first step and then heard Chris scream in pain behind me.

Just as I was turning my head, I suddenly felt lightheaded, something shifted in my vision and I fell onto my back. I tried to blink the darkness out of my eyes and found myself in a familiar place. The forest. I felt a tight clutch on my right hand. It was Iris.

He began walking up the spiral stairs, tightly clutching my hand, as if my fingers would slip out at any moment.

The stairs were creaking under our weight. Once we got to the top, something unfathomable happened. our surroundings suddenly shifted, light appeared above us, illuminating the spiral stairs we were on. I shielded my eyes from the blinding light.

The light breeze vanished next, replaced by a comforting warmth.

I blinked once, twice, and the forest was gone entirely, replaced by tall walls, they reminded me of the walls you'd see in a log cabin. Iris walked up the remaining steps, dragging me along. We were in some sort of cabin. It was warm and cozy, the fireplace crackled peacefully.

"Where- where are we?" I spoke up. Iris's grip had lessened. He released a deep breath he'd been holding.

He turned around to look me in the eyes, half of his face covered in the warm light coming off the fire. "Home."

I could feel the confusion on my eight-year-old face. He finally let go of my hand and got on one knee. "Take off your shirt." Iris instructed me, and I obliged.

He placed his palm on my chest, I could feel the warmth radiating off of it. "It'll take some time to grow them back." He whispered under his breath.

"Grow what back?" My eight-year-old self asked.

"Your organs." He retracted his hand. "Follow me." We walked out of what must've been the living room and into what must've been the kitchen. He grabbed two wooden cups and poured us some clear liquid from a glass jar. It looked like water.

I took a sip, it wasn't water, it was sweeter than water. "How can I grow them back?" I asked.

"By drinking that, and a lot of other things." Iris took another sip.

"Did it take your organs too?"

"No, why would it have?" Iris was looking at me with a confused expression. I had grown a little more accustomed to his red eye color.

"Because you're drinking that too." He chuckled and shook his head.

"How did those stairs take us here?" I let my eight-year-old curiosity run wild.

"Because of me." Iris responded.

"What are you?" Iris smiled at that question, looked me in the eyes, and after a pause spoke up, "I'm your friend."

My vision grew blurry and I could feel myself falling, even though I wasn't. It was so dark that I wasn't sure if my eyes were open or not. Eventually I felt sunlight on my eyelids and opened my eyes. The soft grass below me had cushioned my fall, but I still winced in pain. Then I remembered Chris, and thanks to the adrenaline, I quickly recovered and stood up, doing a full 360 to examine my surroundings.

I sighed in relief when I noticed him collapsed just a few feet away from me. But gasped in surprise and horror when I got closer, and noticed that his head was gone.

"CHRIS!" I whailed out loudly, dropping down on my knee's next to his dead body, not caring if that monster heard me. *This was all my fault. My fault.* Tears were dripping down my face and onto his shirt.

Through my blurry vision I noticed that the staircase was still there, looming over us. Maybe, just maybe this could work.

I stood, picking up Chris's headless body and began limping towards the stairs. If I survived back then, maybe Chris can survive now.
