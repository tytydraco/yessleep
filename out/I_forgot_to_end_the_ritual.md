This started as a joke. It was only supposed to be a joke.

I am a college student so I feel like I have the right to be curious about the world, you know? Like everything I'm doing can be overlooked and forgiven. It sounds stupid but I feel that way because I still feel like I am a kid. 

You know how when you're a kid no matter what you do you will be forgiven at some point. I mean as long as you don't break the law your parents are the only people who hold any power over you. And they punish you by putting you in time out and just reprimanding you in a way where you will be okay in a day or two. Maybe some trauma but nothing too serious. Well this thought is what got me into this deep mess.

Last weekend my friends and I were coming home from a drinking party some college seniors threw to celebrate their last summer as a college student because they were all graduating in the winter. They were officially entering the workforce after December. I got invited simply because my apartment was off campus and my friends needed somewhere to crash after and I don't drink so I guess I was a chaperone as well. 

We all got back to my apartment late and we were taking turns showering when one of my closer friends Julie told me she did a ritual last week in the bathtub. It was a ritual she heard from one of her friends where if you succeed you will be granted 7 days of insane luck, but exactly on the 7th night you have to end the ritual and cut ties with the "luck" or else bad luck will strike. 

I just looked at Julie like she was stupid because this was stupid. I am a horror maniac and I always try dumb rituals. When I was 8 or 9 I played Bloody Mary countless times and nothing happened. Once I got older especially in college I did more daring ones like The Elevator Game, Hide and Seek, and most recently I did the Corner Game with my other horror maniac friends and sure enough nothing happened. So to say I was a believer was a long stretch.

But Julie never likes any of this stuff because both her parents have passed away from a freak accident that the police refuse to give information about and her house is right next to a morgue and cemetery. So she hates it when I talk about horror or ghosts. She feels as if she has a higher chance of encountering these "things" since she's so close to dead people.

So when she brought up this game I was a little confused since she looked dead serious. But she was also dumb drunk so I just decided to humor her and told her that we could do it tomorrow after she's not so drunk.

She just sat in her little green bean bag chair giggling. Everyone else was in either my room or my spare bedroom knocked out, so I was the only person seeing this, and I just sat there really confused on what to say. 

Julie eventually gathered herself together sitting up and looked me dead in the eye. She no longer has the playful glint in her eyes when she jokes. Even the room fell silent, even though just seconds ago it was shaking with Julie's giggles. 

"No listen. I am dead serious. I tried it myself last month." Julie said, falling back into the beanbag chair. 

"You did what?" I whispered back, like I was trying to stop others from listening in on our conversation that just took a very eerie turn. 

"I asked my friend how and I tried it. She said it was completely safe as long as I ended the ritual on the 7th night. It has to be exactly at 11:59pm. I did and everything turned out fine." She said staring up into my ceiling that was decorated with glow in the dark stickers in the shape of stars. I even used special colors to draw out the constellation of the big dipper and a few other ones. 

"So what happens if you don't end the ritual exactly at 11:59pm?" I asked. 

Julie had her eyes fixed on the ceiling not saying anything. 

"I don't know. I didn't ask. I didn't want to know." Julie said calmly, closing her eyes this time. 

" I was desperate." She muttered before falling silent again. 

Not knowing how to respond I just sat there in silence with her. 

I opened my mouth to ask her another question and before I could get a word out a low snore floated across the room. 

I heaved out a sigh knowing I won't get anything out of her tonight so I went to clean up myself and went to bed.

I woke to chattering in the kitchen. I knew my friends were up and getting ready for school. I went to join them after waking up and they all came together to make me breakfast since they crashed at my apartment last night making it into a mess. I appreciate the effort but no amount of pancakes and fluffy cheesy eggs will bring back my silk linen pillows that's now covered in drool, alcohol and some throw up. 

But I'm never the type to hold a grudge. Friendship means way more to me than a few pillows. 

All my friends left one by one after breakfast to go to their respective classes and by noon it was only Julie and I. 

I was still plagued with curiosity and I really wanted some answers but Julie was rushing to finish her homework before class and I didn't want to interrupt her for a few stupid questions. 

Julie started packing up to leave and I was just watching some TV, deciding that I would ask her to come over after her class or something to ask some questions. 

My phone buzzed and it showed that Julie had left me a message.

Julie: I left a note on your desk.
