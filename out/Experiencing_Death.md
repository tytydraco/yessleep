Nov 11 last week started like any normal day. I was getting ready for school, taking my time, and everything seemed fine. I got out the house and rode my bike on my way to school. Then, out of nowhere, it happened, I got into a car accident. It was brutal. I could feel my bones breaking, my lungs collapsing and it was the most real and painful thing I’ve ever felt. Then suddenly, this weird vibration hit me, starting in my head and running through my whole body. Everything went black for a second.

When I came to consciousness, I wasn’t in the car anymore. I was standing on the side of the road, watching the accident happen. I saw someone, lying there in the wreck—bloody, covered in glass, not moving. It didn’t feel real. I stumbled over to a window to check myself out, and I looked fine. No blood, no scratches, nothing. I convinced myself it was all in my head. Just some crazy, vivid illusion or something.

But then I noticed the crash scene, my bike, my backpack, all my school stuff scattered everywhere. That was definitely my stuff. But I was standing there, holding everything. It didn’t make sense. I didn’t know what else to do, so I just went to school and ride my bike like nothing happened.

The day went by as usual, but when I got home, the house was empty. It was around 5:30 PM, and I figured Mom was just out buying something for dinner. No big deal. I killed time by reading my notes in my class earlier, but by 8 PM, she still wasn’t back. That’s when I started getting worried. I tried calling her, but my phone wouldn’t get a signal, not even when I went outside. I knocked on the neighbors’ doors, but no one answered. It was like the whole world went quiet.

I tried to stay calm and told myself she’d be back in the morning. I went to bed early.

The next morning, my alarm went off at 6:30, and I finally heard noises in the house. I was so relieved. I ran out to see her, but she was busy packing bags and crying while talking on the phone. I asked her where she’d been, but she ignored me. I thought maybe she was too upset to talk, so I just followed her to the car and asked if I could come along. She didn’t respond, so I hopped in the backseat.

She drove us to the hospital, crying and yelling, I don't really remember clearly what she said but it's somewhere along the lines of “Why? Why did this have to happen?” I didn’t say anything, I didn’t want to upset her more. When we got there, she rushed inside, and I followed her. That’s when I saw it.

I saw me. Lying in a hospital bed, looking dead.

That’s when it hit me. I didn’t survive the accident. I wasn’t alive. The crash I’d seen on my way to school? That was me.

I broke down. I couldn’t believe it. My mom hadn’t been ignoring me all day she literally couldn’t see or hear me. Watching her cry and seeing her so heartbroken made it even worse. For three days, I just stayed in the house, trying to process everything. It all felt too real, the breeze, the smell of candles from my funeral, the floor beneath me. I thought maybe I was dreaming, but it didn’t feel like a dream.

Then, on the third day November 14, things got even weirder. This orb thing with a bunch of eyes came out of nowhere. It scared me so much and it was a horrifying sight. It was covered in light silk clothing and it has a bunch of different colored eyes and it had no mouth but somehow spoke. It kept whispering, “Do not fear,” over and over. I couldn’t move due to intense fear and even if I wanted to move, I can't. It got closer and closer, and then some warm hands picked me up and started carrying me into the sky.

For a second, I thought I was being taken to heaven or something. But we stopped, and everything changed. The warmth turned cold, and the orb’s whispers became angry. It charged at me, and time slowed down, like a scene in a movie.

I noticed an airplane flying overhead, getting closer and closer until it completely covered my vision. Then everything went black.


Nov 15 I woke up, I was back in my hospital bed. I was inserted with a bunch of tubes and my head hurts with every heartbeat and it feels like a knife stabbing my head a bunch of times. But now I don’t know what’s real anymore. Was it all just a crazy, vivid dream? Did I actually die? Am I still dreaming right now?

I can’t shake the feeling that I’m stuck between two worlds. It’s like I’m alive, but at the same time, I’m not. And honestly, I don’t know what to believe anymore. I feel really weird and the worst part is I accepted my death and bid farewell on everyone I loved. I don't know if I should feel happy or sad.

It's November 16 now and I still can't comprehend what had happened to me.
