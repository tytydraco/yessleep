I don’t know how much longer I have left, but in these last moments before I’m rendered still; I want to warn those I can. If you are in Stási, Idaho, get to high ground. If you aren’t able to reach high ground- whether it is because there is none for you to reach or is inside the Still- then I can only urge towards one option.

Don’t bother trying to call your family. It is either a tremendous waste of time because the towers near you are already Still or utterly pointless as your family may already be Still. Or both. Don’t run to the east side of Stási as that is where it started. I know this because the college dorm I’m currently bleeding out in; rests 2 miles west from the city edge and everything due-east of the front half of my room is still. Do not run west either. My family lived a mile away from the west border and are unreachable as they are Still. I can only presume both south and north are the same. So run to the center if you feel like prolonging what I assume to be inevitable. Otherwise, do the smart thing and kill yourself.

This evening seems to have been cursed. Whatever sins this world has committed I believe are beginning to catch up with it; only now, God isn’t sending plagues. At least not by modern standards. An essay due the prior night was sitting unfinished on the laptop I type on now. The screen had burned itself into my eyes; my brain- suffering some affliction of the writer’s block strain- was stacking pebbles to build a mountain and failing. My gaze only broke from my screen to track a chirping bird’s flight across campus. “Don’t be late for class.” I joked to myself then returned to attempting to cure my affliction. 

It didn’t last long as my eyes drifted back to the dorm square. The grass out front building 2 was standing haphazardly tossed, each blade tipping its head in a different direction from its neighbor. The position was held stolidly and impossibly. The day was windy and the grass was long enough to be blown about in sweeping bows as the wind-tide passed over again and again. Not long enough- however- to remain bowed after the wind departed; especially not in such varied positions. Then I caught sight of the bird. 

Its neck was snapped open and drops of blood floated just below. The wings were splayed out and one was flopped terribly over its back; like it had had its head caught in a trap and fought so hard to escape it broke its wings in the panic. It floated there. Sat. Still. 

I approached the window and slid it open. A visceral, ear piercing silence infested the square. It was the silence of absence. Peering down below I saw: A third of the lawn in front of my building- number 4-  was in the wild omnidirectional bow and a trail of blood. Following it led me to a girl. Her arm floated a few feet away from her, tore off at the shoulder. She laid crawling, one ankle dislocated, trapped in a state of frozen terror. Her face was carved into an expression that contained more pain and fear than I dreamed had been possible. 

I began to retreat from the window. My head suddenly tickled in pain as a few strands of hair pulled out, as if grabbed by the air itself. I fell back, my back driving hard into my bed frame. Only after I sputtered to my feet and reached for my laptop did I notice red paint along my 8 fingertips. Moments later- approximately 2 moments after the pain came- did I realize that this paint was in fact the red meat and my degloved finger tips. The first quarter inch of my fingers had been completely torn off, the nail and an inch of skin had gone with.

My second thought was probably most people’s first: go for the door. My bloody hand wrapped around the knob, but as I’m sure you can infer. It didn’t budge.

A few short minutes of panic later we find ourselves here. I can’t feel my legs anymore as I sit on the farthest wall in the bathroom of my dorm. My keyboard is sticky with blood, but I need to finish this. People need to know. I don’t know if the rest of the world is like this. But I hope it isn’t. Sending this via satellite will hopefully stop any complications with towers being Still. I doubt many people in Stási are on a Satellite network but those who are, I hope you find this. 

If the world beyond Stási still moves. Send help. The sleeping pills are settling into my system now. 19 of them should be enough. I refuse to feel my brain progressively go Still so I see this as the best idea. Goodbye, friends and neighbors. 

Final note: My hips have gone Still but I managed to google “Stási frozen” and only got a result for German ministry security. I can’t find us. How did we disappear? How so fast?
