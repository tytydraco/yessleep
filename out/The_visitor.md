It was a dark and stormy night. Emma was home alone, curled up on the couch with a good book. The rain was pounding against the windows, the wind howling through the trees outside. It was the perfect night for a horror story.

But as Emma read, she began to feel uneasy. It was as if someone was watching her, someone lurking in the shadows just out of sight.

She tried to shake off the feeling, telling herself it was just her imagination. But the feeling persisted, growing stronger by the minute.

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Emma jumped, startled by the sound. She hesitated for a moment before getting up to answer it, wondering who could be out in such terrible weather. As she approached the door, she could see a figure standing outside. It was a man, tall and thin, with a hat pulled low over his eyes. Emma couldn't see his face, but she could sense his malevolence.

The man introduced himself as Mr. Johnson said he was looking for shelter from the storm. Emma hesitated, but something about the man's voice made her feel uneasy.

Despite her reservations, Emma let the man in. He seemed harmless enough, but as the night wore on, Emma began to realize that there was something off about him.

He talked in hushed whispers as if he were hiding something. He kept glancing around the room as if he were searching for something. And every time Emma tried to leave the room, he would block her way, insisting that she stay with him. As the hours ticked by, Emma became increasingly unnerved. She wanted to kick the man out, but she was afraid of what he might do if she tried.

Finally, when the storm began to die down, Emma summoned the courage to confront him. She demanded that he leave, but the man refused.

"I can't leave," he said. "I need to stay here with you."

Emma was taken aback. "Why? What do you want from me?"

The man smiled, a chilling smile that made Emma's blood run cold. "You'll see," he said.

And with that, he lunged at her.Emma tried to fight back, but the man was too strong. He overpowered her, tying her to a chair and sealing the windows shut. Emma was trapped, alone with the man.

As the days turned into weeks, Emma began to lose track of time. The man never left her side, never spoke to her except to utter threats and taunts. Emma was alone, with no hope of escape.

But then, one day, the man did something unexpected. He let Emma go.

Emma didn't know why, but she didn't question it. She fled from the house, running as fast as she could, until she finally found help.

The police arrived at the house, but the man was gone. He had disappeared without a trace, leaving behind only a few pieces of evidence.But Emma knew better. She knew that the man was still out there, still lurking in the shadows, waiting for his next victim.

As she looked out into the darkness, she knew that she was never truly safe. The visitor had left his mark, and Emma would never be the same.The police searched for the man for months, but they found no trace of him. Emma tried to move on with her life, but she couldn't shake the feeling that he was still out there, watching her.

Years passed, and Emma grew old. She had a family of her own now, but she never forgot about the man who had terrorized her all those years ago.

And then, one day, she received a package in the mail. Inside was a single sheet of paper, with a message scrawled in messy handwriting.

"I'm still here," it read. "And I'm coming for you."Emma's heart raced as she read the message. She knew that the man had finally found her, after all these years. But she had no idea what he wanted from her or what he was planning.

She tried to call the police, but her phone was dead. She tried to run, but her legs wouldn't move.

And then, as she stood frozen in fear, the door to her house creaked open.

Emma turned to face the darkness, her heart pounding in her chest.

And then, everything went black.
