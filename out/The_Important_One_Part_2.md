II. 

It was like that for many days. I would leave for work with no worms and return with the slithering, curling body in the corner and its mantra lulling me to sleep. The only change I’d see in it was when those fucking neighbors fought. It seemed to excite it. The body of worms would quiver and its mantra would get earnest and quick. 

Then, it occurred to me one day at the factory. Really a brilliant thought, if I don’t say so myself. None of it was real. Not the worms. Not the worm body. Not the voice. I had lost my mind and not just a little. By simply knowing that, I could take control of it. Perhaps, stay sane or at least approximate sane. 

I put it to the test that night. I took a breath outside my front door. “It's all in your head man, it's not real,” I reminded myself and then entered the door. I came around the couch and there it was, its gangly body spiring to the ceiling. Already, the disembodied mantra rattled deep in my ears:

*“Heya Barry. What’s with the shovel? You need to go over there. They won’t believe you. Non est momenti unum.”*

I yelled, angry almost unhinged, “Shut the fuck up. You are not real!”

It did not shut the fuck up, but I felt it's power over me diminish almost immediately. I was not invisibly coerced into my chair. Nor did I have to stare at it mindlessly until its words put me to sleep. I was free to move about. Proud that I had made such a significant breakthrough, I fried some spam, my first dinner in weeks.

That night, I pulled my shoeboxes down from the closet and closed my bedroom door, the mantra of the worms now dulled by the stained walls between us. I opened each bag, one-by-one with care, deeply taking in the sweet smell of dead pheromones. Unique. Important.

Turning out the lights, I undressed, laid down on my sheets, and positioned the bags of hair on my naked body like a blanket. Don’t judge too harshly. We all have our habits deep in the night when nobody else is looking. The glorious scent of the hair wafted up and felt as if it was filling my entire body, a deep connection I can’t quite explain. All these important people here with me, all mine.

I closed my eyes and t realized the full extent of what I had discovered. I, a poor schlub from the eastside, had found the cure to insanity. I had conquered it. Sure, I could still hear *it* from the other room droning on and on about shovels and people not believing me and all, but it no longer held sway over me. I could be here naked with my hair, where I always have and always will belong.

And as I climaxed, I could see the future, a future unlike anything I’d had or been told I could have before. I could write a book and tell the world about my discovery. Sure, I wasn’t the greatest writer, but when you have a message worth sharing people will read it anyway. I would be both pitied for my insanity and revered for my ability to overcome it. First, would come the talk shows. Hell, maybe even the Today Show. That Jane Pauley has the most beautiful golden hair. Then, a book tour. They would all clap when I spoke. With the money and fame, I could leave this shitty duplex and head to California. All the celebrities would want to know me. I would be one of them. I would collect them. 

I would be the important one.

III.

I assure you, I am not a fraud. The summer days came and went and with each I employed my strategy, reminding myself that what I saw and what I heard was not real. And each day the body of worms grew smaller and the mantra of worms grew quieter until they barely existed at all – only a small cone-shaped pile, those cursed words only a whisper, if that. I was convinced that soon they’d be gone all together. I even returned to my couch in the evenings to watch my shows and enjoy the cool breeze. At bed, I’d retire to my collection. Soon, I’d start my book, when I felt the inspiration of course.

This brings us up to the night that you keep asking me about. The one you seem singularly focused on, though I can’t tell why. I’ve told you so many important things. The clouds rolled off the lake and blotted out the moon so that it was only a faint far away halo. It was so dark I tell you, as if the very air was liquid and all that existed was that cursed duplex. With it came the rain, the type of thick, gusty rain us eastsiders are accustomed to. 

I had just sat down in my recliner, but the rain was blowing through the open window, wetting the floor and the small curled pile of worms beneath it. I went to close it, but I guess something happened next door. I heard a loud thud against the wall, louder than I’d ever heard in all their nights of fighting. Then, something like glass breaking and then again. There were yells and screams too, less muffled than normal but I still couldn’t quite make out what they were on about.

This had gone too far and I was tired of the noise. I grabbed my snow shovel. I would bang it against the wall until this stopped. I’d put a fucking hole in the wall if I had to if it’d make them stop. 

That’s when I heard it, no longer a whisper but as booming as it had always been, maybe louder.

*Hiya Barry. What’s with the shovel?*

I came to the wall. Maybe it was the pitch or perhaps it was the sheer volume and terror, but I heard as clear as if there were no wall between us a woman scream, “Somebody help me.”  And then another crash and the dull knock of something hitting the floor.

*You need to go over there.*

Now, I’m no hero and I already explained none of this is my business, but the noise had to stop one way or another. So I listened. When I got to their door, it was wide open. This was a bit of annoyance because just a few gusts of rain and they could have a mold problem which meant I would have a mold problem. It’s just that easy and I didn’t want something else wrong with that cursed duplex.

I stood for a moment considering if I’d go in. The noise had stopped after all. Though it was dim, I could tell from the doorway that something significant had happened. A shelf had been knocked over and shards of glass littered the floor.  There was other stuff strewn across the floor also, but it really was too dark to tell you what all of it was. You know anyway.

I called out a few times. Nothing. Had they left? If so, they might have something valuable in there. I know it’s shameful, but I’m a capitalist. You need to take advantage of the opportunities God gives you.

“Fuck it,” I told myself and went in, but kept my shovel close in case someone was still inside.

I scavenged through most of the house - the drawers, the closets, even the cabinets and furniture broken on the floor. They didn’t have shit worth my time. The only thing interesting was a leather-bound scrapbook of sorts filled with newspaper clippings, some recent some from over 15 years ago. It was mostly crime stuff. A series of rapes on the northside. Four or five murders. All women. Most involved strangulation with some sort of unknown ligature from the best I could tell. Was this guy some sort of cop or reporter?  This I’d keep.

I’d forgotten to check the bathroom. As I came to the closed door, I stepped in a liquid, viscid and slippery . It was dark, so I could not tell what it was, but it’s pretty obvious to me now. The light was on in the bathroom, so I knocked and then opened the door slowly. And oh Jesus the scene that opened up to me. It’s still visceral even now as I tell you. 

She was there on the floor, twisted, unnaturally twisted. Her limbs were bent, probably cracked, almost crab-like. Was it Ashley? I’m still not sure because her face was completely caved in. It was only bloodied meat and shattered bone. Was it Ashley? You still haven’t told me.

I was understandably frightened, jumped backwards, and slipped on what I knew now must be blood. This threw me forward right on top of her so that we were  face-to-bloody cavity. The shovel and scrapbook fell fully into the blood. In my horror, I slipped and struggled to get to my feet under me, so much so that I was covered with warm sticky blood. I never knew it was so sticky. And the smell, so strong like iron or something. You folks probably know it well, but for someone like me who isn’t around it all the time,  it was surprising. Shocking even.

I picked up the snow shovel and scrapbook. They were heavy with blood and I ran back to my side of the duplex and straight into my recliner.

They had returned, the worms that is. I’d never seen them build up so quickly and so tall. Its legs alone rose to the top of the wall and its upper body was now bent completely on the ceiling, towering over me, leering again with its eyeless face. I reclined all the way so we could see each other fully. Just me and the man of worms. And for the last time, the booming voice.

*“They won’t believe you.”*

*“He is the important one.”*

And as I saw your red and blue lights through the moth-eaten drapes of my open window, I knew it to be true and I no longer cared what happened to me.
