What more is there to say, a giant mosquito killed my dog. I’m a total idiot and left my gun inside when I took him out. It was calm for a little bit but they’re just so bad this year, we got swarmed pretty fast. Fuck I loved that dog. Rest in peace Bubba.

The guy that usually takes care of the massive mosquito larva had a heart attack or something over the winter and I guess no one else in town knew how to deal with it so we’re a little behind this year.

These fuckers get massive too, like their bodies are the size of a slug bug and their bloodsuckers are like fucking flag poles. They’ll go after anything and it’s typically a death sentence if they get you. If you miraculously manage to survive being impaled by a gigantic needle, they’ll drain your blood pretty fast. Definitely more of a hassle than a little itchy bug bite.

Honestly, these days, for us it’s less of a safety concern and more of an economical one. When they get bad like this it really fucks with our local businesses. We rely pretty heavily on seasonal tourism but who wants to come up north to their cabin for the summer when you gotta worry about your kid getting turned into a husk by mosquitos. I mean don’t get me wrong, half the reason people get property up here is for the “unique and diverse” wildlife but the giant mosquitos, people don’t usually care for. 

One guy in town built a massive bug zapper in his shop to try to slow them down or at least keep them away from town. It worked pretty well but unfortunately every time it killed a mosquito the whole town lost power. The air would also smell like a fried mosquito for days too which kinda smelt like charred meat but was still unpleasant to deal with every day. It worked well but maybe too well, so much so our infrastructure couldn’t handle it. 

We found out pretty fast that, duh, guns are very effective. You can take one down in a shot or two, maybe three depending on what you’re carrying. You learn pretty fast up here it’s best to just always be packing some heat. When you do find yourself shooting down one of those fuckers you have to be careful where you shoot because if you hit a full blood sac good luck. It ends up being a huge disgusting mess, it stains the roads and sidewalks, oh and you’re gonna look like one hell of an idiot. Locals will give you shit but if you buy a round at the bar people forget pretty fast.

Right now we’re working on building pretty much a giant thermacell to hopefully put up kinda like a "forcefield" in the air around main street. If that works we’ll build more closer to peoples lake properties. Us locals have picked up volunteer shifts throughout the day to shoot down mosquitos. It’s not glamorous but it’s proud work. Hopefully they’ll start slowing down soon but who knows. All I know is with massive mosquitoes comes the massive shit that eats the massive mosquitos. The dragonflies are already getting bad and those fuckers are even worse.
