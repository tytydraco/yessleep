I don’t know what to do.

My roommate Jake is missing. He was here about a week ago. I heard him. We even talked for a bit before we went to bed. But now, it’s like he was never here at all.

Let me back up.

Jake and I share a two-bedroom apartment. Nothing fancy, but it’s home. He’s a chill guy—leaves dishes in the sink sometimes, but otherwise, a good roommate. Last night, we were both in our rooms, winding down for the night. Around midnight, I heard him moving around, probably getting a late snack.

I yelled, “Yo, bring me some chips!”

He laughed, said, “Get your own, lazy ass.”

That was the last thing he ever said to me.

I woke up this morning and his bedroom door was wide open. His bed was made. Like… perfectly made. Jake never made his bed. Ever. His shoes were by the door, his phone on the nightstand, his keys in the bowl by the entrance. Everything normal—except he was just gone.

I called him. His phone rang from his nightstand. I checked with our friends. No one had seen him. His car was still in the lot.

I started freaking out and called the police. They came, looked around, and asked me a lot of questions I couldn’t answer. There was no sign he had left. No texts, no calls, nothing packed. They acted like I must’ve just missed him leaving, like I was overreacting.

But I know Jake. He wouldn’t just vanish like this.

Then I checked the security camera in the hallway.

At 2:13 AM, the camera shows our front door. It never opens. No one goes in, no one goes out.

But at 2:14 AM, his bedroom light turns off.

And at 2:15 AM—

The door to his room slowly swings open.

That’s it.

No one comes out. No one goes in.

Just… the door opening.

Jake never left. But he’s not here anymore.

And no one believes me.


Update:

It’s been a week since Jake disappeared. The police have officially labeled him as a missing person, but without any leads, the case seems to be going cold. I’ve been staying at my parents’ house since it happened; I can’t bear to be in that apartment alone.

Last night, I had a dream—or at least, I think it was a dream. I was back in the apartment, standing outside Jake’s room. The door was ajar, and a dim light spilled out. I could hear a faint whispering, like multiple voices speaking in hushed tones. I pushed the door open, and the room was empty, but the whispering grew louder, more urgent. I felt a cold breeze, and then I woke up, drenched in sweat.

I don’t know what to make of it. Was it just my mind playing tricks on me, or is there something more sinister at play? I can’t shake the feeling that whatever took Jake is still out there, and it might come back.

I’m considering going back to the apartment to look for more clues, but the thought terrifies me. What if I end up like Jake?
