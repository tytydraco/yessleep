The gentle pitter patter of rain against my face woke me up, sending me into a slight panic as my senses were dull. I opened my eyes, only to be met by the extreme darkness of a stormy night in Vietnam. I tried to speak, but my ears rang so loudly that I couldn’t hear myself, or anything for a matter of fact.

As I lay entrapped, my body mangled by the crash, I tried to gaze around at my surroundings. My head throbbed, and if it wasn’t for the constant bursts of sparks and small flames covering the mud, I would have thought myself blind. The helicopter was hung up in thick foliage, suspended by many branches piercing the thin metal body. I looked to my left, to see both pilots dead. To my right, I saw out of the chopper, and its contorted and deformed tail. 

Such a crash was uncommon, usually our air cav went up in flames when engaged by AA. I nervously ran my tongue over my lips and the thick, metallic liquid told me that I had sustained a nasty head wound. I had no recollection of the crash, or any part of the mission before that. As my hearing slowly returned, the jungle came alive. The sounds of various birds and insects began to fill my ears.

To my left was Sergeant Owens, who was horribly mangled in his seat. In shock, I reached for his hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. He had a two year old daughter, it was a shame to see him like this. As I looked at the corpses suspended in the trees with me, I noticed that there were no bullet holes present in the helo. We weren’t downed by small arms, we weren’t downed by AA, so what could have taken us down?

As I pondered what had happened, I considered that maybe the weather had done us in, there was a storm after all. Just then, I heard a sound that always terrified me. The heavy “thump” of artillery. Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump. I closed my eyes and waiting, considering in my panic, that maybe I was the target of such fire. However, the thumps didn’t stop, and the shells never landed. The adrenaline began to wear off, alongside the shock, and a horrible pain rose in my legs. I hadn’t noticed that my legs had been terrible mangled by the crash. I couldn’t tell where the chopper started and where my legs ended. 

As I felt myself beginning to get nauseous, I noticed the most shocking sight I’d seen my whole time in the Nam. On the right side of the helicopter, just directly next to me, was a line of clawmarks, each of the four massive tears in the metal was at least four inches wide. I looked to my left, and noticed that the scratch had gone across the entirety of our transport. My eyes met the grim pile of gore that was Sergeant Owens, who I now noticed was missing his left arm, the clean cut hidden by his intestines. 

Meanwhile, the steady “Thump, thump, thump…” continued, and felt as if it was getting closer. The fuel that had spilled onto the ground had been ignited by the sparks, illuminating the base of the trees that suspended us in the air, and a little bit of the jungle. As the terrible ruckus got closer, I noticed two massive feet come to a stop roughly 30 feet away from the base of the crash. 

I must have not inhaled a single breath for a minute, as I slowly looked up at the beast for what seemed like an eternity. Its body was covered in matted fur, scales, torn flesh, and it’s giant, asymmetrical face wore an evil look of joy. It’s teeth gnashed, its eyes sat a few inches apart, and its massive head was scarred and dirty. As I stared at the abomination, it looked inside the helicopter. I felt it’s breath which smelled like the decomposing bodies we come across after air strikes, specifically napalm strikes. 

In that moment, its eyes met mine, and it slowly unhinged its jaw to release a guttural sound, that of a massive boat horn. I felt concussed. It lifted its hand and grasped the helicopter, yanking us from the tree with little effort, and began to turn in the direction it came from. As it walked, it spoke in a tone of a frenzied whisper, occasionally raising its voice in various languages. It mimicked many voices, the cries of young Vietnamese soldiers, the pleading and begging of French veterans of the Second World War, the cursing and frantic begging of Aussies, and the screams of my fellow Americans.

I eyes the doorgun, a massive M60 suspended for easy use. With my right hand, I aimed at the creature and pulled the trigger, but it was too badly damaged to fire. My vision grew blurry and the pain was overwhelming from the constant movement, and I blacked out.

I awoke in complete darkness, unable to see my surroundings. Suddenly, a bright light filled my vision, and I felt no pain. The thought that maybe I had been lucky enough to die excited me, but when I felt cold steel against my flesh below my knee, I began to panic. I gloved hand covered my mouth, and a needle was slammed into my right arm. Almost instantly, the pain went away, and the face barely illuminated by the flashlight held in my face gave me a smirk, as the soldier patted my shoulder.

I looked down to my legs, which had been applied tourniquets, and amputated just below my knees to free me from the helicopter. I was taken out of an extensive cave network, loaded onto a medevac helicopter, and watched the sunrise while various medics worked on stabilizing me. When I landed, I slept for what felt like weeks, on and off. When I finally regained some function, a few men dressed in fancy suits with clipboards told me that I’d never speak of this again, and that if I did, I’d be institutionalized. Now that I’m nearing the end of my life in sickness from Agent Orange, I’ve decided to recollect what I remember from the night of September 7th, 1969. VC wasn’t the real target of the US government, horrors you could never imagine lurk deep in those jungles.
