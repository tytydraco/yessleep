I love having tea parties in the warm sunshine, especially when Mummy and Daddy are free to join me. I like hearing the birds singing and the quiet away from the other kids.

"Here you go, one cup for Mummy, one cup for Daddy and one cup for me, marvellous." They love my tea, they say I'm the best at making tea. That I know just how long to let it stew in my favourite big red teapot. "Drink up Mummy and Daddy, before it goes cold. Oh no, it's OK Mummy, I will clean it up." Mummy and Daddy sometimes knock their cups over. They are small cups, but Mummy and Daddy's fingers are so long. Mummy looks upset about spilling her tea, even though the cups are empty. I like that they still play along. 

I know what will cheer everyone up, a big slice of chocolate cake. This is a special day after all, we can't sit here all day being moody about spilt tea. 

"Look  Mummy and Daddy, isn't it the biggest chocolate cake you've ever seen?. Here's your favourite plate and a big slice of cake for you Mummy. You're so thin now, you don't need to diet anymore. A big slice for Daddy and a very big slice for me, mmmm mmmm."

Mummy and Daddy sometimes say I'm so sweet that I would probably taste amazing. They laugh when they say it but I hope they don't really want to eat me. 

"Shall we have more tea Mummy and Daddy? More cake?"

Well my tummy is so full it could burst. I think we'll do some drawing now. "I've brought my favourite crayons with me Mummy and Daddy. Shall we draw a picture of us having a tea party and eating the biggest cake in the world?" Mummy and Daddy aren't very good at drawing, so I just do it. They'd only waste the paper.

"What do you think Mummy and Daddy, isn't it the best picture you've ever seen?"

The sun is smiling on us and I don't even have to colour in Mummy and Daddy. Not since they look as white as paper now. A happy family tea party, marvellous. 

Oh no, that's Miss Waters shouting me, she's calling me back inside to get washed up ready for tomorrow. Mummy and Daddy aren't allowed inside the big house. Miss Waters says they aren't real and doesn't like me talking to them. Mummy and Daddy would be very mad if they heard, so I don't tell them. They get mad at me if I forget they are real. They just sneak in when the lights go out. I usually see them standing at the end of my bed. They just watch me quietly with their big black, button like eyes. Miss Waters says I will have a new Mummy and Daddy tomorrow anyway. She says this could be my chance to finally leave and have a real family. I will miss old Mummy and Daddy but they do creep me out sometimes. They're just so tall and skinny since the accident.
