[Seek the highest hill.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16saedq/how_to_survive_college_thrift_stores_have/)  How was I supposed to do that when everything around me was flat?  Though for the first ten minutes or so, it didn’t really matter.  My priority was putting some distance between me and the battling inhumans.  The laundry lady had a weapon now, but the flickering man was winning the fight when I’d finally abandoned Plan B.  He was tearing the laundry lady apart and worse, he now had the intermittent rain to help him.  It was merely spitting from the sky, but it seemed to be enough to give him the ability to teleport.

It was rather unfair, I thought.  The sky didn’t even have clouds.  It was an unbroken gray expanse that radiated light in a diffuse haze, like sunlight through fog.  I tried to avoid looking at it, for my eye was unwillingly drawn to the horizon each time and I did not want to see what resided just beyond the curve of the earth.

Besides, I had to watch where I was walking.  I’d run until the laundry island was out of sight, focusing only on moving straight ahead to put the most distance between me and the flickering man.  I ran through mud and standing water alike, trying not to look at it, trying not to think about what the laundry lady had told me.  The water was tepid against my skin as it soaked through my shoes and splashed on my bare calves.  It was like the world had been drained of all extremes.  Nothing was too hot or too cold, too bright or too colorful.  It was a drab, dull world, devoid of life.

But it was also a blank canvas.

The thought came to me abruptly, after I’d stopped running forward and was instead trying to pick my path more carefully.  Back home, we all thought that the gray world was unique to the campground.  Just another strange bit of the inhuman that had wedged itself in among the trees and picnic tables.  But between the master of the gray world and the things Kate had found in it - the fact the Lady of Stories was in it before Kate even knew anything about that - makes me believe that the gray world exceeds the campgrounds.  *Far* exceeds it.

The laundry lady’s realm was a world unto itself when I first visited, with laundry stretching as far as the eye could see.  But it started *somewhere* and that place was apparently here.  It returned to the gray world when it was shattered and she was now rebuilding it inside the gray world.

What if… what if this was kind of like the inhuman central station?  The intersection between all other realms?  Perhaps I could find something that connected to the steam tunnels, since those doors don’t always open up to where you think they will.  Or perhaps - there *was* the traveling river.  I’m not a strong swimmer and I certainly haven’t been practicing, not after my encounter with the swimmers that one time, but it was better than wandering through the gray world for eternity.

The only problem was I didn’t have anything near me that even remotely resembled a door.  Or even a symbolic door or archway.  Anything that represented crossing from one point to another.

There was nothing.  Nothing except the water.

I stared at it for a long moment, debating hard with myself.  The laundry lady had warned me away from it, but perhaps that was because it posed more of a threat to her than it did to me.  Maybe each pool reflected a different place and I just had to find the right one.  One that led to the steam tunnels or the traveling river or - and the thought made my skin crawl - the black slab of water in the power station basement.

There was plenty of standing water around me.  I just had to pick some.

I crouched, ready to jump up and run, and peered down into the water.  It was only a few inches deep.  I could see the muddy bottom.  But there was something else, in the corner of my eye.  I tried to focus on it without looking at it directly.  If I could make out what it was - if it was a place - then perhaps I could tell if it was safe to use this water as a portal, I guess, to get back home.  I admit this was a flimsy theory, but Plan C wasn’t working out so great on account of, oh, *there being no hills*.

The image rippled in the water, eluding my efforts to figure out what it was.  I squinted, trying to find a stable point that might anchor the image.  Was that a hallway?  Did I find the steam tunnels?

It’s funny how our minds betray us.  We get a theory in our heads and are so convinced it’s right that for a moment, it becomes our reality.

The ground beside me shifted, almost imperceptibly.  There was something near my foot - something long and thin like a worm.

Startled, I shot to my feet and stumbled backwards, away from the water.

Away from the thing that was crawling silently out of it, the thing that had placed its hand right next to my foot.

It had only half a face, one side twisted up in a leering grin with a single eye the size of a raisin.  The other half was a swirling mass of clay-like flesh, roughly shaped into the form of a cheek and the hollow of an eye, curling around to form ridges where the ear should go.  Like a bowl on a potter’s wheel, I thought, before the potter is done giving it form.

Its body creaked and cracked as it rose from the water.  I stumbled backwards in horror, unable to tear my eyes from the sight.  Metal cables hung loosely from its shoulders and back, like the feathers of some tropical bird.  One arm was longer than the other.  For a moment it stood there, knee-deep in water that I could see the bottom of and it was only an inch, it *should* only be an inch.  Then it tilted to one side, there was a sharp crack, and it straightened again.

Its arms were now symmetrical and its veins bulged, splitting the wet skin and pushing to the surface with a metallic shine.  It took a step toward me.

I think I yelled ‘shit’ at the top of my lungs and then I took off running.  I didn’t have any destination in mind because there was nothing to run to in this featureless wasteland.  I was frantically trying to get away from it.  If only I had some kind of weapon, I thought desperately.  I hadn’t brought the charm bundle because I felt it was best to leave it with Cassie, to keep our dorm room safe while I was gone.  Besides, it probably wouldn’t work - not if this creature was something *new*.  But if I had a shotgun like what the folks back home carried when pursuing something inhuman… then maybe I could slow it down.

“This was a terrible idea!” I shrieked to an uncaring sky as I ran.

Okay so the master of the gray world is a horrifying creation beyond any inhuman.  It’s mere presence threatens to wipe away my very sense of self, rendering me as insignificant as a single speck of dust.  However, when faced between encountering *that* again and being torn apart by… a construction site’s dumpster trash… I knew which I’d pick.

There was no hill.  But perhaps the hill was merely an artifact of the campground.  I was still on campus, enough that the rain was present here, so perhaps I had to find something symbolically important on campus.  The administration building?  Not only was it important, but it was also one of the taller buildings on campus.

No.  Screw that.  The administration is part of the problem.  I didn’t really care to see what kind of a realm they had in the gray world, if they had one at all.

Then where else?  Where else is significant enough on campus to exist both here and there?  The library.

Of course.  The devil had shown it to me and I thought it was for one purpose, but this is the devil in his trickster role, and there are meanings upon meanings.

The cemetery.  The *tree*.

So I began walking as quickly as I dared, no longer trying to carefully pick my way through the mud and between the gray, leafless trees.  The creature was pursuing me, but it wasn’t following me very fast.  It was dragging its steps through the earth, buried up to its ankles in mud.

Like the ground was trying to swallow it up again.

There are no monsters protecting the gray world.  Kate’s uncle had spoken of a creature that stalked him and the wayward campers but it wasn’t a singular entity prowling around, watching for intruders.  It was these things, the half-formed remnants of our nightmares and our stories, crawling their way out of the morass as they catch the scent of something human.

Is killing one of us how they become real?  Or are they driven by impulse, like a muscle that will twitch when attached to a live wire?

I’m going to keep a close eye on the campus discord next year.  See if anyone says anything about spotting a creature with metal cables buried in its arms in place of veins.

I walked until I felt like I would collapse, my legs burning with exertion.  I knew that I had to keep going, though.  I didn’t bother to look back.  Either I’d outdistance the creature or I wouldn’t.  And even if I did, even if it got sucked back down into the morass, there was always a risk of something else coming crawling out.  I had to focus on my goal and keep going, because if this world recognized intention, then I would *make* it take me to my exit.

I might be scared all the time and have the world’s worst panic reaction, but you can’t say I’m not determined.  I escaped my hometown, I went to college, I turned my grades around with a little help from the devil.  I’ve done more than anyone else has to figure out these creatures on campus and do something about them, when most people just put their heads down and try to quietly finish their four years so they can move on and pretend it was all just a bad dream.

I had a will and I would use it to compel the gray world to take me where I wanted to go.

Ahead of me I saw a tree rising out of the ground, larger than all the others around it.  Its bare branches were sharp against the gray sky, blending one into the other so that the entire thing looked like a paper cutout.  And I stopped worrying about the monsters and the water and everything else, because the master of the gray world was there, staring down from the tree’s massive branches.

I don’t remember much about approaching the tree.  It’s like I saw the master of the gray world and then I was there, standing amongst the tangled roots of stone and wood, braided together like rope.  Creatures ran among them, scuttling about on thousands of legs, but I ignored those too, and they paid me no heed.  Perhaps they didn’t exist in the gray world at all, but some other place where the tree was but was also here and also in my world.  It didn’t matter.  I was here for an audience with their master.

It spoke to me.  It said that it would make no offer or bargain, for it could tell my intent already.  Even if I knew my death, I would not stay, and so it would not burden me with such knowledge.  It only made such an offer to those that would choose one way or the other.  I had already decided.

I think I may have said something in response.  I’m not sure.  I’m not sure if I spoke or if it heard the words as they vibrated in my lungs, unable to escape underneath the crushing weight of its presence.  And this was it being polite.  This was it diminishing itself, simply so I could stand before it and not fade away into nothingness underneath the gaze of the entire world staring down at me.

It sent me back.  There was a sensation like being carried, like being swept up in palms or wings, so massive that I was a mere insect but it held me so carefully, and then I was placed back in my world.  Back in the cemetery, and it was gracious enough to place me away from the tree so that the groundskeeper wouldn’t come for me as soon as I was back in my world.

Finally, all the adrenaline that had kept me going for however long I was in there started to seep out of my blood.  I was left shaking and weepy, but it was okay, I was done.  I just had to leave and go back to my dorm and I’d worry about who won the laundry lady vs. flickering man battle tomorrow.

I did not need to wait until the morning to find out.

The flickering man met me at the gate.

He… did not look great.  His shirt was torn in a few places and the skin was blackened and blistered, as if with a chemical burn.  One arm hung limply by his side, his fingers curled inwards and fused together.

“Looks like the laundry lady threw some detergent on you,” I giggled.

It just kind of slipped out.  I was lightheaded.  Nearly delirious.  The flickering man’s scowl deepened.

“I’m done with this shit,” he said.  “You know way too much.  I’ll make my apologies to them later.”

I faltered, standing in the open gates of the cemetery.  This was it.  He was breaking the rules. I wasn’t soaked through with rain, he had no right to touch me. The laundry lady had said that would be enough to force the administration to act.  I held my breath.

A raindrop hit my cheek.  I wanted to shrivel underneath it, curl up and sob right there on the sidewalk.  Of course it was starting to rain.  Of course.  My determination had gotten me out of the gray world, but this was my reality now, and reality isn’t so accommodating.  Just because I wanted to graduate, to *live*, didn’t mean it would change a damn thing around me.  It was just me, the rain, and the flickering man who was now able to follow me wherever I might run.

Then he paused.  The rain had struck him, but his corporeal body remained exactly where it was.  He didn’t vanish into the raindrops.

“W-what?” he stammered.  “I don’t understand.”

He stared up at the sky and I felt like he wasn’t just talking out loud.  He was speaking to it.  To the rain.

“But I’m only trying to help!” he shouted, his eyes desperately searching the sky.  “That’s what I’ve always done.”

He flinched as rain struck his damaged hand.  Hissed in pain.  I stared at him, watching incredulously.

I was the one that assumed the flickering man worked for the administration.  I’d given it that name and the laundry lady had just gone along with it because that is the right of humans, to name things.

But it was the rain.  It was the rain all along.

“I was doing this to help you!” he shrieked, jerking away as if he were burned when another raindrop struck him.  “You don’t know that this will work!”

He jumped from raindrop to raindrop because *the rain* allowed him to.  Now it had not only taken away that gift, but it was also rebuking him.  He fell to his knees, raising his arms to protect his face, my presence entirely forgotten as he pleaded with the rain falling all around us.

“You… you just had to do what you’ve always done,” he sobbed.  “Please.  Let’s just… keep things the way they are.  There’s still time.  We’ll find another.”

He crumpled, falling sideways to lay on the ground, panting heavily.

“I don’t want you to leave us,” he whispered.

I didn’t know what would happen if I walked away.  Perhaps the rain would consider this warning sufficient and let him live and then this would all start over next year.  I took a step towards him, not even sure what I was thinking of doing anymore.  The flickering man’s gaze tracked my movement, staring up at me weakly, his entire body trembling as the rain continued to fall.

“You can’t do anything without running for help, can you?” he rasped.  “I don’t know why they picked you.  I don’t know what *anyone* sees in you.”

He might be dying at my feet, but it seemed he still wanted to make me hate myself.  And something in me cracked.  I was tired of it.  I’ve done enough of that for a lifetime, I think.

“Okay, I’m sick of this!” I shrieked, my voice breaking.  “You’ve been insulting me since the moment we met.  I might just be a weak little human but I know - I *KNOW* \- that we humans are what *created* you!  I don’t think you hate me - I think you *resent* me because I-”

I took a deep breath.

“I can change,” I said quietly.  “And you can’t.”

No more hesitation.  I was afraid, yes, but I couldn’t keep letting that fear stop me from protecting myself, from protecting the people I cared about.  I glanced up and down the sidewalk.  No one was around.  It was so early in the morning that there would be almost no one still awake.

Good.  I sucked in a careful breath and then… I stopped thinking.  Stopped thinking about anything.  I felt my body moving, felt myself dropping to one knee beside the flickering man.

And I grabbed his hair.  I pulled his head up.  Then I slammed it down, into the pavement upon which he lay.  He made a strange, gasping noise, but I wasn’t listening, I wasn’t even *looking*, I just pulled him forward and slammed his head down again until there was a crack.  Until water like raindrops spread in a puddle beneath him.

Until he was dead.

And I left him there and the rain washed him away.

I threw up when I returned to the dorm.  I just went straight to the bathroom and threw up.  Then I went back to my dorm room and found Cassie was still awake, waiting for me.  She asked if our plan worked and I said that yes, it had.  It worked.

I told her that I’d killed the flickering man with my own hands.  Then I took off my socks and shoes, still wet with the water from the gray world, and crawled into bed.

There’s not much more I need to say.  I finished up my finals, had one last dinner together with Maria and Cassie.  I saw Grayson and while we didn’t talk about anything important, we did promise each other to keep in touch over the summer.  He had to stay here to keep an eye on his dad and I was going to be busy with my summer job - yes it’s exactly what you think it is.  Taking sweaty boob money from campers that forgot to bring limes for their gin and tonics.

Maybe I was imagining it, but Grayson seemed more cheerful than he had been when I talked to him.  I didn’t tell him I used him to trick the flickering man into angering the rain.  I feel guilty for keeping that from him.  I think Cassie is right - we’ll need to work through our secrets at some point if we want this relationship to work out.

Next semester.  When we’re not long-distance.  This is the kind of thing you do in person.

There is one more thing I need to tell you.  I didn’t unpack for a few days after I got home from the dorms.  When I finally got around to it, one of my younger sisters helped.  She was unpacking the box that contained mostly my cheap dorm decorations and maybe some electronics - charger cables, mostly - when she held up something and asked why I had a funny rock among my things.  I had a number of funny rocks now, on account of being a geology major and all, so I turned to see which one it was and maybe throw in an impromptu lesson on how to identify a sedimentary rock, I dunno.

It was a piece of petrified wood.  One that looks like a heart if you squint a little and apply enough imagination.

The piece of the petrified tree that belonged to my geology professor.  The one stolen out of his locked office.

I have no idea how it got into my belongings. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
