It was a normal night like any other. I spent the day with my friend, getting our nails done before she left for England to visit her long distance boyfriend. I saw some friends and hung out way too late, before one of them offered to drop me off at the train station so I wouldn't have to walk.

This late at night, the station was a ghost town, with just a few people nursing bottles held in brown paper bags. I made my way into the desolate train station, looking for the correct platform, but there were so many. It looked like the station stretched off into the distance, there hadn't been that many platforms when I arrived earlier in the day, had there? 

My anxiety really ramped up when the screens weren't working; they didn't show where the trains were going or coming from on any of the platforms. I brushed it off since I'm already an anxious person, I figured I was just confused so I chose the platform I thought I came in on and asked a conductor of another train company if I was on the right platform. He said I was but my train was unusually late. He told me to go to the other platform across the way if my train didn't show up 10 minutes before it's departure time. 

A few minutes after that train left, my train arrived. The doors opened, so I figured I could go and sit down early before anyone else showed up. It struck me as odd I didn't see anyone leave the train, but I just figured nobody was in this particular train car coming out this specific door. Too late for anyone working, too early for anyone to be coming home from the bars.  

I had made my way up the stairs to the second level, sat down next to one of the screens, hoping it would tell me where I am in my journey, but it was blue screened with the words "He's dead, Jim!" Scrawled across the screen, along with some other font that was too small for me to read without my glasses. It was weird, but I thought I could just listen to the loud speaker and actually pay attention to figure out where I was. My phone had no service under ground in the subway, so it was just an expensive paper weight at that point.

The train began moving but the voice over the speaker was wrong. Demonic, one might say. Full of random beeps and blips. I brushed the worry off and started looking out the window, watching for the station signs to start passing us by. None did, it was all just a blur of darkness outside the window. Shit. 

I heard the speaker come on again, unintelligible noise assaulted my ear drums before the transmission ended in a hiss that sent chills down my spine. 

I could hear someone laughing in the distance, but it sounded wrong. Rather than being full of mirth, it sounded panicked, the way someone laughs when they're nervous. 

This was when I began to truly realize that something was off. I looked around, trying to catch a glimpse of the other passengers. Mostly to see if any of them looked as freaked out as I felt. The train car was mostly empty at that moment, but I could see a woman with tears streaming down her face while she smiled. A man was staring very intently at the wall, rivulets of something dark slowly dripped down the back of his neck from under his baseball cap. It was in that moment, I knew, I fucked up. 

A girl walked by me, long black hair completely covered her face and she wasn't wearing any shoes, she trailed thick black streaks with each step she took. 

More people had started filing in at that point, but we hadn't made any stops yet. I didn't know where they were coming from. A man walked in and sat down across from me. His eyes were practically glued to his phone, but when he did look up to see the passengers around us he startled. A pitiful squeak escaped his lips, causing everyone else in the train car to turn towards him. He was staring at someone down the train who I couldn't see, as panicked sobs started to escape his lips he managed to croak out, "her eyes, what the fuck is wrong with her eyes?!" I didn't know what to do, I simply made eye contact with him and tried to slyly shake my head, to tell him not to draw attention to us. The passengers didn't stop staring at him until a conductor with a strong stench of decay and burning plastic showed up and led him away. He didn't fight it, just let the conductor drag him away while seemingly frozen in fear.

So now I'm sitting here, trying to control my face and not let on that I shouldn't be here. I can hear voices further down the train, almost like stage whispers that I can't quite make out. 

There have to be other normal people on this train. There's plenty that look normal, but they all seem unfazed by what's going on around us. 

I'm scared, and now that I'm on the train, I don't think it's taking me home.
