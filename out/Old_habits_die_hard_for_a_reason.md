July in Portugal is usually very hot and unless you're near the river or by some park resting under some tree shadows, Porto feels like climbing a mountain, with all it's hard up and downhill streets. Like many others at the end of their workday, I went for my usual cocktail with some friends and  stayed by the caf√© until it was time to go to the bar.

I wasn't exactly looking for hookups but I managed to caught this blond white, bulkish guy looking at me from time to time. Not my type, with his muscles showing, but the alcohol was lowering my guard and my flesh is weak. Made some eye communication back and, fast forward some bar flirt, he went to my place for some fun.
I opened the living room so air could circulate, started kissing him on the hallway and locked the bedroom door behind me as we were getting in.

Two weeks later I managed to meet up again with blondie, at my place, for the casual hookup with some wine and snacks. Woke up the next day during the afternoon with a regular hangover and him already gone. 

- We hitting on the gym rats now? That's new. - said Filipe, my house mate. - Your recent hook-up was walking around the house looking for the bathroom and opened my bedroom door by mistake. I pointed at it and he got so jumpy he just said 'sorry' and went back to your room to dress and leave the house. You know I don't lock my room, I'm always scared something might happen to me and no one will noti-
- Yeah, yeah, I know. I'll warn you next time at least, I promise! - I interrupted while grabbing my coffee.

It's the end of the month and it's the hottest day ever. Am not quite ready for more fun since I only want to melt away on the couch but the hormones kick in when I last want them to, so I invite my blond guy over. We first go for some groceries and then we head back to my place. Since he was carrying most of the bags, I offered to help carrying what looked like a gym bag but he abruptly shook his shoulders so I couldn't touch it. Paid it no mind and just kept going up the stairs.

We're watching a documentary on something but I'm barely hanging on to anything that is happening, it's too hot.
- Ok I'm done, I'm really not in the mood, I'll take a nap. You can crash if you want, I just don't feel like sleeping together with this heat, sorry. Filipe won't be home for the night so it's fine if you want to stay on the couch. - I muttered as I started to leave to my bedroom, quite drunk and sweaty.

- I'll go home then. I'm done for the day too. - he said while dressing up. - I'll tidy up and leave, give me a kiss.
- Just make sure the door is shut when you do, thanks blondie!
Kissed him goodbye and heard the main door being shut as I walked to my room.

While closing the door, I suddenly felt less drunk and goofy for some reason and ignored the laziness of it all. Locking the door didn't seem like it was due to force of habit.

- Open this door, RIGHT NOW!!!

I woke up in a flash, shaken by the sudden bang and just looked for my phone. There were sounds of something that looked like plastic bags coming from the living room so I tried to join Filipe to ask what was going on.

- OPEN THE DOOR, NOW!

More awake now, I realized the sounds didn't come from the neighbours but from outside my door. I swallowed so much dry air as I was trying to say something that I started coughing and trembled, gasping for air. I stopped mid way to the door as soon as I got back into my senses. It wasn't Filipe, it was blondie. He was still in my house.

The door was now being kicked and pushed and I could see the knob moving. I couldn't move. I was trying to make sense if it really was him or if I was just still sleepy and hangover or if the door would hold. 

- I'LL BREAK THE DOOR. I'LL DO IT. OPEN. 

I clutched my phone to my chest as my expression changed and my heart went into survival mode. The boy I've been sleeping with was trying to barge in and now I was locked inside my bedroom, on a 4th floor. 

- What's going on? How- How are you still here? You're scaring me, wtf?!

More accurately now, I heard some ruffling plastic sounds and him going back and forth.

- You have 15 seconds. - his voice went back to a normal level now, but faint. Casual bangs on the door, as if he was giving up or just tired. 

- I have my phone with me. I'm calling the cops right now, are you insane? I'm not leaving this room! - I lied as I only looked at the door in shock, fearing it would open at any moment, imagining it was my last few breaths.

- Open the door, please. PLEASE. - He proceeded but without banging, just normal knocks. His voice was very calm but somehow desperate. 

- The police is on the line now! - I shouted hoarsely as I went back to the phone. - Hey I need help. Someone is inside my house trying to get in my room. I'm locked inside and he's screaming. Please help me, I don't know what to do.

All the sounds stopped. No more weird rustling, kicks or begging to come in.

I must have been in total panick because I managed to call for help without remembering how exactly I did it, I just noticed the call was still on after a couple of minutes. I was pumped with adrenaline trying to figure out if it was really happening to me and what could I do while help was or not on the way.

I was too afraid to even get to the door and check through the peeping hole so I just stayed back with my phone in one hand still connected to 112 and the bed lamp on the other hand that I grabbed to defend myself.

I don't know how long it was untill I heard something again but I only came back to my senses after someone on the other side insisted with my name.

- Are you okay? We're here now, can you hear me? You called for help, I'm with another agent. It's safe now. My colleague is still on the phone with you, you can ask her to identify us if you don't feel safe yet.

As my heart started racing again, I wiped some tears from my eyes and slowly went for the door while trying to answer the lady on the phone.

- You're safe. It's all ok now. - The other officer said while rustling something that sounded like plastic bags again.

The sounds made me shiver once more since it was what I heard before with blondie there, making me question if it was a trap while being sure it wasn't. Being rational was giving me an headache. I agreed to leave and started moving towards the door. 

- Before you come to us, we must warn you. We can clean this up, you don't have to see anything. You just need to wait a little longer. We don't mean to scare you but it's up to you to decide to leave or wait. If you think you can handle it, feel free to leave. There's nothing gruesome, however, we promise. 

Curiosity mixed with adrenaline made me go to the door right away to give a slight peek at the keyhole, just to make sure, just in case. I could see someone with a dark uniform walking around some plastic wrap that was on my floor, making those sounds I heard before. 

Having confirmed it was the police, nothing could prepare me for the biggest thud I was ever going to feel in my stomach. 

My floor, couch and table were protected by a giant transparent plastic wrap. Next to the table, blondies gym bag, open. On top of the table was, very carefully organized, some surgery material like some scalpels, small metal plate with more utensils inside, folded towels and some rope. I couldn't make sense of what else was there because tears started filling my eyes as one of the officers came to me very slowly and the other talking unintelligibly on his walkie-talkie. 

- We believe he wanted your organs. - the officer said as he got closer to me and pointed at the table. - The house is empty, all the doors were open when we arrived. No one suspicious around the building, neighbours didn't see anyone leaving for the past hour. It's all ok now. 

I moved to a different house after 2 weeks of staying at my parents. The guy was never caught. 

All my doors are double locked now.
