My brother, Mike Tetro, disappeared on March 4, 2022. His car was found by a remote trailhead, about fifty miles northeast of Denver, but despite a lengthy search, he was never found. The official explanation was that he got lost in the vast Colorado wilderness, but I didn’t believe that.   


  
Mike was a journalist for a local paper in a small Denver suburb. He reported on all the happenings in the sleepy town—from the town council meetings to the high school football games—but he wasn’t satisfied. He tried to get positions at larger newspapers but had no luck. So, to try to make a name for himself, he decided to infiltrate the Mob.   


  
Most people are surprised to learn that the Italian Mafia, the Cosa Nostra, exists in Colorado. But it does. During prohibition, two brothers, Pete and Sam Carlino, controlled much of the bootlegging operations in the state. Following their assassinations and the repeal of prohibition, the Smaldone brothers took over. They ran some gambling houses, engaged in loansharking, and controlled a portion of the drug trade in the state, but were never very well known, especially compared to the East Coast crime families. The 2006 death of their crime boss, Clarence Smaldone, was believed to mark the end of the Colorado Mafia.

  
However, there were whispers that they were still active in some mountain towns. My brother heard the rumors and decided to investigate. I warned him that doing so would be dangerous, that if the Mob was somehow still around he’d likely get himself killed, but he was undeterred. He was always a stubborn one, never listened to me.   


  
After I heard about his disappearance, I knew that he had been murdered. I tried to get the FBI involved but they just laughed at me, insisting that the Mountain Mafia was defunct. After over a year of trying, I decided to take matters into my own hands. This past June, I headed to the mountain town of Silver Ridge and rented a one-bedroom cabin under the name John Towson. 

  
It was a small settlement of about 500 people. In the 19th century, it was a prosperous mining town, but the silver’s long gone and the town was now impoverished. Unlike some of the other mountain towns, there was no ski resort, and it subsisted largely on the revenues from the few tourists who came by during the summer. 

  
Mike hadn’t told me much about his investigation, but he did say that a pizzeria owned by two brothers, Sal and Stanton Granito, was a front. That was where my investigation would begin. I began driving for Uber Eats. As the pizzeria was the only eatery in town, I was there several times a night. 

  
It was located on the outskirts of town, next to an auto body shop which was apparently also owned by the Granitos. The inside of the pizzeria was filthy—the linoleum tile was yellowed, the vomit-green paint was flaking off the wall. Flies were constantly buzzing all around. There were only three tables inside, all of which were invariably empty. The parking lot was always full though. I’d see people walk into the restaurant and head for a door in the back marked ‘Employees Only.’ It was guarded by an oversized goon named Donny. He was dressed like a rent-a-cop, in a black jacket emblazoned with ‘Security’ on its back and a plastic badge dangling from his neck, but he carried himself well. Looked to be ex-military, clearly several notches above the average security guard. And he was armed. With a Glock 19. 

  
Donny always seemed to be watching me while I waited for the order. I’d done my best to change my appearance—I had grown a beard, shaved my head, and bought colored contact lenses, but I was scared that he would see through my disguise, that he would notice my resemblance to my brother. 

  
I occasionally saw Sal and Stanton. They were nearly identical—fat middle-aged men who wore ill-fitting sports coats and flared pants. Sal was always nice, he’d get me a complimentary slice of pizza and some zeppole while I waited, but Stanton (I have no idea why any Italian would name their kid Stanton) never said a word to me. They didn’t spend too much time in the dining area, they were usually in back. 

  
I had hoped that I would overhear some chatter, but the front section was always deserted. I needed to find a way to the back. Two weeks after I first arrived, I asked Donny if I could use the bathroom. 

  
“Can’t you read?” he growled. “Employees only.” 

  
Sal, who was wiping down one of the grimy tables, came over. “Don’t be like that, Donny. Let him in.” The goon swung the door open and I entered a narrow corridor, Sal following close behind. 

  
“So you’re new to town, aren’t you?” Sal asked me.   


  
I nodded. “Yeah, renting a place here for the summer. Live in Denver. I’m a writer, working on a fantasy novel. Thought that escaping the city, spending some time in the mountains, would be a cure for writer’s block. Drive for Uber to pay the bills.” That was the best story I could come up with. There weren’t many good reasons why someone would move to a little mountain town.

  
“A writer, eh?” Sal said. “We get a few of those every year. Forgive me if I already asked, but what’s your name?”   


  
“John Towson.”

  
“John Towson,” Sal repeated. “I’m not trying to be nosy, Johnny, but do you mind if you show me your ID? I know you’re not a G-man, but I just like to know the people I’m dealing with are who they say they are.”  


  
I had come prepared. I produced a fake Colorado driver’s license and handed it to Sal. He looked it over, smiled, and handed it back to me.   


  
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Johnny. Bathroom is down the hall on the left. As you may have guessed, we do a little more than sell pizza here. Directly across from the bathroom is a little casino. Not much, but there are a few slot machines, a roulette wheel, and a poker table. Feel free to stop by after your delivery. Restaurant closes at 8, but we’re open all night for gambling.”  


  
I thanked him and said that I’d stop by later that night. After I completed my delivery, I returned to the pizzeria. The restaurant was closed, but Donny was standing by the door and let me in. Without saying a word, he escorted me to the gambling den. 

  
It was a small room, maybe 200 square feet. Four slot machines were pushed up against one wall. A handful of people were clustered by the roulette wheel, which was being operated by Stanton. Next to it, Sal and five other men were playing poker.   


  
Sal stood up when he saw me. “Johnny, my new friend, get over here.”

  
I sat down and bought some chips. It was a blue-collar crowd—there was a mechanic, a truck driver, an off-duty policeman, an electrician, and a maintenance man. We played for hours. There was talk about plenty of illegal activities, ranging from bookmaking to drug trafficking, but nothing about my brother. Sal kept getting drunker and drunker, and I was sure that he, in his inebriated state, would say something to the new guy, brag about how he and his brother had sniffed out a rat, but he didn’t. 

  
The crowd began to disperse around two. Soon, it was just me and the Granitos. I said goodbye and started heading out when Sal called out to me.   


  
“Hey, Dave, you forgot something.”

  
I was beginning to turn around when I realized that he had called me by my actual name, not my alias. I ran towards the door. Waiting outside was Donny. The goon tackled me, yanked my arms behind my back, and handcuffed me.   


  
Sal and Stanton stumbled over to me. “You didn’t think you’d fool us, did you now?” Sal asked. “You may have gotten a fake ID, but we had that cop you met run your plates, and guess what, it was registered to a Dave Tetro. What a coincidence.”

  
“I just wanted to know what happened to my brother, that’s all. I won’t tell, I swear.”

  
Sal chuckled. “Yeah, we are going to guarantee that you won’t. Don’t worry, it won’t be as painful as your brother’s death. We shoved a rat in his mouth, took a blow torch to his eyes, cut off his dick, and let him bleed to death. Took several hours for him to die. Then we dissolved his body in acid. That’s why he was never found. It’s called a *lupara bianca*, a clean killing.  Donny, put him in the trunk of my car.”  


  
“You want me to come with you, boss?”   


  
“Nah, we can handle it ourselves. Stay here, guard the place, I don’t know if he told anyone else.”  


  
“Are you sure you don’t need help?” Donny asked.

  
“Jesus fucking Christ,” Sal exclaimed. “Yes, I’m sure we can handle it.” 

  
Donny picked me up, ignoring my kicks, and carried me around to a black sedan. One of the brothers popped the trunk and the goon threw me in it. A few minutes later, we were off. I tried pulling the emergency release latch, but it had been disabled. My attempts to kick the trunk open similarly proved ineffective. My only hope was that someone had seen my kidnapping, or that one of the inebriated brothers would be pulled over, but I doubted that. Even if we were stopped, I had a feeling that the police in this town were in the pockets of the Granitos. 

  
\*\*\*

  
After an hour, the car came to a stop and the trunk popped open. The full moon revealed Sal aiming a revolver at my chest. “Get out,” he ordered. 

  
I had no choice. We were high in the mountains. A narrow trail, alongside the edge of a steep cliff face, winded up to a cabin about two hundred feet above us. The cabin where I was going to die. 

  
We set off. Stanton was leading the way. I was behind him, the barrel of Sal’s revolver pressed against my back. It soon became clear that Stanton was having trouble keeping his balance. This was my chance. About halfway to the cabin, Stanton stumbled over an exposed root. As he was struggling to regain his footing, I kicked out with my left foot. I didn’t think it would be enough, but it was, and Stanton went tumbling off the cliff, screaming. 

  
If Sal had decided to shoot me, I’d be dead. But he turned his attention to his brother and let go of my handcuffs. My heart pounding, I took off, sprinting up the path. A few seconds later, I heard gunshots. Either Sal was too drunk, or he was just a bad shot, but the first five missed. The sixth bullet grazed my left shoulder. Fueled by adrenaline, I kept going. It wasn’t easy, especially with my hands cuffed behind my back, but somehow I managed to stay upright.

  
I had no idea where I was. I ran through the spruce and fir trees for what seemed like hours, trying my best to ignore the pain. Finally, when I thought my legs were about to give out, I reached a narrow gravel road. I didn’t think anyone would be driving at this hour, but about twenty minutes later, I saw the headlights of a truck. They slowed as they passed but didn’t stop.

  
Unable to keep going, I waited by the road. At times, I thought I heard voices coming from the forest, the sounds of footsteps, but no one showed up until an hour later, when two state troopers and an ambulance pulled up.  I was still nervous, thought that these might be crooked cops, but I had no choice but to go with them.  I was loaded into the ambulance and we took off. 

  
At the hospital, I learned that while Stanton’s body had been found, there was no sign of Sal or Donny. I don’t know where they are, but I have a feeling that I will see Sal again. He killed my brother and I killed his. One of us will die. That is the only way this will end.
