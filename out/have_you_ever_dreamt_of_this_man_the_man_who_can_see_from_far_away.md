Writing and posting this here out of sheer curiosity if anyone else had a similar dream when they were a kid. This dream would scare the ever living F out of me. The man in these dreams also stated that he does this to many children and visits them too, so I’m genuinely curious if anyone else has seen him. 

When i was really little I used to have this recurring nightmare and it was almost episodic, starting out where the last dream had ended off. I dreamt I was laying in bed in my bedroom and everything was the same except the entire wall across from my bed where my feet were pointing down to was entirely glass, floor to ceiling it was just one giant window. I grew up in a bungalow so our house was all on street level. I lived in on a quiet dead end street and had a small grassy front yard. From my bed I would see my whole front yard and driveway and little side street illuminated by the streetlamp outside. I remember in the dream I was always wanting to fall asleep but was always too scared to, being forced to just stare out the giant creepy window instead. 

Then I would see a man slowly walking up my driveway and then cutting through my front lawn until he stopped dead centre at my window wall, getting as close to the glass as he could. My memory is hazy but I remember him looking like a tall, pale bald man in his mid to late 40s. He always had the creepiest smile on his face, which was almost pressed against the window. He would proceed to speak to me telepathically, his mouth never moving but we would have an entire exchange in my head. 

He would remind me that no matter where he was in the world, near or far he could always see me and was always watching - hence why I named him the man who could see from far away. He reminded me that he knew everything about me and my life and there was nothing I could hide from him. His presence was so menacing and filled me with so much dread. I knew that he knew that my parents didn’t know about him, and that even if they did they would never believe me anyways. It was like he took so much pleasure in this sick understanding between us that I was stuck with him, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. 

The details of all the different episodes are very hazy, but the one I remember well I will share with you. One night he comes up to my window and does his usual spiel, telling me about the other children he can see and what will happen to them. I tell him to go away, that Inwould yell and that my parents would wake up and come and see him. He laughed and then very mockingly said “Speaking of your parents, I know they’re going on vacation next week. I know they’re going to (random exact hotel location and country) and I know that you’re going to be all alone.” 

My stomach dropped and I just felt pure terror. There was this immediate sinking realization that I knew that meant he was going to murder my parents on their vacation and finally break in and come for me.
