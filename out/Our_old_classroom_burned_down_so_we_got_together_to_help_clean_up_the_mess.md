The President smiled at us from his pedestal in the sky - there, in a distant capitol where the long angular shadows of buildings loomed over you like hungry giants. He smiled upon us with an air of enduring dignity, and the two rows of white teeth glinted on the cheap, plasticky material his portrait was printed on.   

*I bet his house is air-conditioned*, I remember thinking to myself as the sweat on my back glued the fabric of my uniform to my skin. During the early afternoon, the stuffy homeroom classroom of my sophomore year felt like the inside of an oven - a crematorium of sorts - and smelled nearly rotten with sweat, body odor, and the excrement of the bats that dwelled in the trees of the school grounds.  
I went to a public school - not the well-funded, big city kind that even the rich kids went to sometimes. No, I went to a public school in a village that was mostly fields and forest, tucked away from the rest of the province behind steep hills and trees that clawed their ways up to the skies.   

There were barely a thousand of us living in the village, so it came to no surprise that our school was underfunded. The single, creaking ceiling fan that tried its best to keep all thirty two of us comfortable during the equatorial summers was enough proof of that.   
High school - a time spent mostly praying for rain that wouldn't come the entire afternoon - is a thing of the past now. I graduated six years ago - the discomfort of humid afternoons in that classroom now survived only as the faintest shadow of a memory.   

I was digging through my second plate of rice, seated before the grainy box TV in the common area of my boarding house when Sarah, an old childhood friend, called me. From ages six to sixteen, I can count on my fingers and toes the number of days when she and I didn't walk to school together.   
"Remember our second year classroom?" she asked me on the phone, "It burned down last week. I was wondering if you were free this weekend - they still haven't gotten around to cleaning it. Maybe we could all chip in and help get it in order again? No, the other classrooms are okay."   

Looking back, it seemed as though the news barely disturbed me at all. If anything, I was annoyed at the fact that I had been interrupted in the middle of dinner.  
I considered the invitation, however briefly. There was nothing for me to do that weekend - I had no work. All I did was lie in my little bedroom while a fan blew hot air in my face. I didn't want to spend my weekend like that, so I agreed.  

The trip from the city I worked in to the little village I grew up in was not a particularly scenic nor dramatic one. I spent most of the one-hour commute sleeping in the bus with my mouth hanging open, and when I arrived I wasn't greeted by a band of family members who were surprised, but ultimately overjoyed, to see me. I still came back home every other weekend to save up on a few meals and to gain some much-needed freedom from all the noise.   

It was the arrival of Sarah, and the rest of my batch, that was met with warm smiles and open arms. Some of them hadn't been here since they were whisked off to college, and a few of them had flown back from their jobs abroad to lend their aid in our little act of charity. Meanwhile, I stood there, observing, and occasionally offered a cordial handshake or comment about how much this and that had changed.  

I felt myself shrinking inwards as everybody talked about how much their lives had changed since they left our village. I can kid myself into thinking I was free - I found myself a job at a call center in the nearest city - but I was still very much a part of this awful, mind-numbingly dull village. Nobody really asked about what I did or where I worked. It was almost as if they could smell the sour, sickly rot of my stagnation - like a waterway clogged with sewage and dead rats - from miles away.  

Still, the excitement of being there overpowered the self-pity that welled deep inside me, and I soon warmed up to my peers as well. We were all invited to dinner at our barangay captain's home, and one of our old teachers, Miss Lubayo - who was now married, and legally a Mrs. - came to say hello. The evening was a pleasant affair, and sleep came to me softly much later that night.  

Our little "clean-up drive", as we decided to call it, started at 6:30 a.m.. We came dressed in jogging pants and long-sleeved shirts, with sun hats and several gallons of water loaded into the back of an old pickup truck. There were only fifteen of us, but we were all eager to start the task of hacking down the weeds surrounding the classroom.  

Our old high school was small - if you're picturing it now, I need you to think even smaller.   

It consisted of two buildings - one L-shaped main building where the shared principal's and faculty office stood in one end and the common restrooms on the other, and a smaller, newer building that was perpendicular to the school's main gate.   

Separating the gate and the buildings was a small school yard - a field of unkempt carabao grass pocked with puddles of dark brown mud - where the flag pole stood right in the center.   

The old classroom, the one that burned down, was in the second, smaller building, on the end farthest from the gate. Miss Lubayo tagged along, and during one of our water breaks we asked her exactly how the fire started.  

"Well," she began, "do you remember Manong?"   
My first instinct was to ask her which one, and then I remembered that she was talking about a very specific Manong - one we all remembered. He was the old school janitor.  

My first impression of him when I was twelve was that he looked so much like a tree - his arms were thin, dark branches that ended in the twigs of his knobby, rounded fingers, and his skin had the withered, leathery quality of someone who had spent his days working in the sun. I mean all of this with no prejudice, as my parents' skin had looked similar as they aged, after years of toiling for me and my siblings to live well. Our school was small, so I ran into him often. He was quiet - and moved around with the imperceptibility of a ghost - but was pretty hard to forget.  

"His life has been very difficult - it's complicated and I don't think we have the time. I only heard this story from rumors - he never did tell us much about his life from the start…" she was beginning to trail off, so she pulled herself back for a moment, before continuing:   

"Anyway, his life got difficult, they say. His wife died of a stroke, his son died in a motorcycle accident -"  

Sympathetic *Oh dear*s and *Oh god*s rose up in whispers, momentarily interrupting her, and when everyone had the chance to interject, she resumed: "He was quiet before, but then he got quieter. He stopped greeting us in the morning, stopped volunteering to do things - it's the small things, you know. We tried cheering him up - tried talking to him - but…"  

He tried setting the school on fire, apparently. His nephew, who moved in with him after the death of his only family, showed up in tears to the scene of the crime the following morning. "He got drunk," he told them breathlessly, "He threatened to set the school on fire, he said he got tired of everyone minding his business. I thought he was just drunk, and raving - he's old, you see - so I got him into bed and thought he'd just fall asleep."  

There was something so uncanny about finding out that the timid man who glided through the corridors with a mop and broom tried to commit arson in a drunken rage - and yet he did.  

The tale ended with him disappearing - it was assumed that he ran away, and was probably wandering the next village with his eyes glazed over, his only connection to reality being the fact that his feet were on the ground.   

We were all sad to hear the story, but when the shock died down fifteen minutes later, we started with our other tasks.  

The charred remnants of the classroom were covered in soot, dirt, and melted plastic. Chairs lay crumbled and blackened on the floor, and flakes of burnt paper tumbled about in the breeze like feathers. We began to pick up the larger pieces of debris, tossing them into sacks as we went.   
It was then that I heard a dry, croaking voice from somewhere behind me - it was groaning, or mumbling something. I turned around, facing the old chalkboard. A huge crack appeared along the upper right corner, creeping down towards the center before finally ending just before the bottom frame. Whatever parts of the chalkboard hadn't been burned off looked very brittle, as if the slightest touch could send it toppling over.  

The voice was faint, but I knew it came from behind the chalkboard. I hesitated, looking back to see if anyone had heard it too. Nobody seemed to - maybe it was too faint for them to hear.  

I stepped a little closer, if only to hear what it was, "...may their harvest be little, and their children grow sickly. May their pockets run dry…"   

More wishes for misfortune were uttered, solemnly. My breath hitched as I tried to step backwards, but the temptation of having my curiosities granted was too irresistible. Instead, my body drew nearer to the source of that demented prayer.  

"May their women be barren, and their sons and daughters full of hate…"  
Instinctively, I dug my fingers in between the cracks of the chalkboard, and pulled the sheet of burnt wood. It gave way easily, and my heart sank to the ground.   

Behind the burnt chalkboard was a frail, thin, burnt body crouched in the small crevice of the wall. It shuddered, as if still alive, its hands clasped together in prayer. The parts of it that I assumed were burnt were blackened, like coal, but the rest of it looked like it was made of wood. It looked like a tree. Then I realized -  

It was Manong - whatever little flesh and fat he had was consumed by the fire, his gray hair nothing more but wisps of white on top of his charred head.   
His prayer came to an end. He muttered an amen as he looked up at me, through jaundiced yellow eyes, and for a moment I felt myself drowning into the vast emptiness of his irises. I tried to breathe, but choked on the air, and fell back, landing on my backside with a hollow, aching thump. From the looks of it, he set the classroom on fire, and tried to burn himself with it too.  

When everyone gathered around to ask if I was alright - to see if I was hurt - I could only feel a bubbling hatred rising up my throat - for them, for Miss Lubayo, for the rest of this godforsaken village that would never leave me alone or mind my own business.  

\*May their sons and daughters grow full of hate…\*  
Would you believe me if I told you that I could still smell damp, burnt wood in my room at night? When I closed my eyes, those deep black eyes with its yellow sclera still leered down at me.   

I can sense him creeping behind the thin walls of my bedroom. It grows hotter every night - maybe his fire is drawing nearer.
