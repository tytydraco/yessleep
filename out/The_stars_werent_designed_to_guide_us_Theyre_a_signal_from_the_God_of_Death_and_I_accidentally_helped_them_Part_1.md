Humanity has always looked towards the stars for guidance. Since the moment our lungs could draw breath, we’ve deciphered meaning from the cosmos. Time, agriculture, mathematics, social identity, religion; they all have roots within the night sky. Rivers and tributaries that carved their own unique path through this world, but their tides lead back to the same centralized body of water. You just have to walk back up the riverside far enough to see where they connect.

Because of that fact, I’ll forgive you if you are someone who equates *the celestial* with *the divine*. I mean, that association is a goddamned cultural infestation. Most religions believe God lives in the sky. Many staunch atheists trust in the mysterious power of the zodiac. Even the scientifically inclined among us believe the explanation to existence is hidden somewhere within the black depths of space.

I used to be one of those scientists, actually, and that brings me to the point of this post. Partially, it’s a message; I need to speak to someone, and I know they'll read this. Mostly, though, consider these words to be my solemn, heartfelt confession.

I was wrong, and God, I'm sorry. The stars only bring death, and for the last one hundred and forty years, I’ve acted as their conduit.

They hold power. They generate understanding. They drive ambition. But that’s all part of the design. *Its design.* It wants us to dig deeper. It’s begging us to untangle the directives that its penned with the faint blue light of incomprehensibly distant planets as its ink. If there truly is a God that cares about us, they created space to separate humanity from what lurks in the darkest recesses of existence. 

I don’t know its name yet, but I’m very close to finding it.

For now, we’ll just call it Sallow. The word fits nicely for the time being; it has the correct flavor. Whatever you want to call it, all you need to know is this: Sallow is a bloodless apostacy made of pale death that churns unseen, watching our every move from the shadows created by the stars, waiting for someone foolish enough to take the bait it so carefully laid out.

One hundred years ago, I was that someone.

Circuitry, as with most technology, was born clumsy. In the 1920s, electrical currents were wired *point-to-point*. In very basic terms, we had a lead that carried current to a conductive metal that connected it to another lead, so on and so on. Awe-inspiring, but decidedly inelegant. Costly to produce and fragile; not an ideal combination for a developing industry.

So, the race was on for someone to invent a better alternative. A 2.0 to the prototype. As a young man, that elusive evolutionary step was my obsession. The boundless pursuit kept me from thinking of Charlotte and Nathanial, my wife and son who died in a house fire while I was overseas, pushing Germany back from the Western Front. Despite my rigorous education prior to the draft and my near-infinite free time, I couldn’t crack the puzzle. Not without help from above.

Whenever my frustration with the task hit a boiling point, I would lay down my pencil, walk outside, and gaze up into the sky, searching for answers.

As a boy, I always had a soft spot for the natural world; the celestial in particular. The vast beauty of space captivated me. God’s gift to mankind, my mother would tell me; a heavenly kaleidoscope that the almighty would slide over the sky once the sun set. Look through it, and the bleakness of this world is briefly overwritten by the shimmering radiance of the stars.

Sometimes, if the earth was quiet enough and the night sky was clear enough, I could hear Nathanial’s voice curling into my ear like a whisper.

*“Look,”* is all he’d ever say. Or maybe that’s all I could ever hear. Maybe that was the part he said the loudest, even though it reached me as a wisp.

He was very far away, after all; hopelessly imprisoned within Sallow. But I didn’t know that then. 

Years passed. My grief accumulated like a frugal investment, which only made my pursuit of innovation more frenzied. I thought if I could invent a better circuit, that would rectify my loss. The fire that took my family was electrical in origin; a failed insulator. Everything would be right in the universe if I succeeded.

One unassuming night, I followed Nathanial’s voice. When I did, my eyes landed on a very particular constellation. A collection of stars that has served as the bridge between Sallow, my mind, and the rest of humanity.

Gemini.

As it all clicked in my head, I finally heard what my son was *actually* trying to say. And this time, it wasn’t a gentle whisper slithering into my ear from the great beyond. It was blood-freezing wail projected from the blackest pits of hell.

***”Look Away.”***

But at that point, it was too late.

I could only open Pandora’s box. I couldn’t close it.

\------

By the next morning, I had created the first printed circuit board ([see here for my schematics](https://imgur.com/gallery/gemini-circuit-board-PuoTDUC)). Back then, I believed that I had just been *inspired* by Gemini. In reality, my design was identical to the constellation.

I hadn’t invented anything; I just transcribed its profane message when the time was right.

Once I had submitted my design to the patent office, Sallow was done with me. My role was to be a catalyst and nothing more. I released the contagion. From there, the pandemic was slow but inevitable.

And since Pale Death had no more use for my mind, they did not feel compelled to spend their energy protecting it from the onslaught.

Once they arrived, I could see the maggots everywhere. 

Sickly white worms the size of sausages crawling over everything and everyone. Burrowing into them. Influencing their actions. Writhing and squirming through their brain, making them believe that reproducing Sallow’s insignias was *their* idea. The more technology advanced, the more of them that I'd see. 

They're slinking over my fingers as I type this. 

If I’m honest, the delivery system is undeniably brilliant. Modern circuitry is just an infinitesimally small fraction of Sallow; a portrait of the devil hiding within every electronic, from cell phones to FM radios to the batteries in a sedan. Every constellation, in reality, is a visage of Pale Death, and that visage runs rampant within circuitry. 

They are tendrils shaped like stars, reaching out from the abyss, offering humanity a Faustian Bargain. The gift of power, with a catch lingering in the fine print.

I was just the one who channeled it. 

In my first life, I didn’t know any of that. I thought I had just lost my mind. I was convinced that I had succumbed to the eventual insanity that surely comes with inescapable melancholy.

The patent didn’t make me wealthy. Never fell in love or married again. I died under a bridge, alone, alcohol swimming in my stomach, thousands of phantom maggots crawling over me that only I could see.

A long, fetid exhale billowed from my lungs, and I felt my consciousness become weightless. It fell from my body and into the sky, towards the stars; towards Sallow.

Before I could get too far, however, my soul regained its gravity and plummeted back down to the earth.

When it landed on my corpse, I *molted*, and I know how that sounds. There’s just not a better way to describe it. I shed my cadaver like a cocoon, and it fell to dust around me. When I sat up, I was much younger. The same age I was when I first discovered Gemini, wearing the same clothes I was in when I delivered the design to the patent office.

I don’t know what exactly kept me here. Not yet, at least. I have a guess, but that’s an explanation for another day.

For now, I need to pause my story. It wouldn’t be smart of me to reveal my full hand all at once. Primarily, I’m using this post to get someone’s attention.

Avery, I know you’re reading this.

More than that, though, I know what you did to Charlotte and Nathanial.

Meet me where they died - Sunday at 7 PM.

I need you to give me [Sallow’s name](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/s/SwTyCChXJc).
