>!Cordyceps fungi are a group of parasitic ascomycetes that primarily infect insects and arthropods, with some species known for their potential health benefits in traditional Chinese medicine and as dietary supplements.!<


"I'm back from the pizza place"

"Hey Matthew, did you get a call back after your interview?"

"No not yet Stacy, did you take your meds yet?"

"... yeah..."

"Did you take them twice?"

"..."

"Stacy you need to take your meds"

"I know, its just that whenever I take them I feel more sick"

I felt saddened, knowing the pain Stacy has been going through, after her diagnosis I sadly could only watch as she slowly deteriorates, she was only five when she was diagnosed, I was 12, I was the same age she is now "I know, I'm just worried, you only seem to be getting more worse"

*Ring* *Ring*

Our interaction was cut short as the phone ringing cut through the otherwise empty apartment, I quickly went over to answer it, hoping its the news I have been waiting for. I picked up the phone, only for my face to fall as I heard the voice on the other end "Yeah sorry, we had a better canidate, but tell you what, we'll keep your resume open, and we'll put a good word in for wherevery you apply next"

I put down the landline, Stacy could tell from my expression what the interviewer said, the person who I hoped would be my future employer.

"Did you apply somewhere else" I could hear the sadness in her voice, "Yeah, but the only place I haven't a response from is some run down entomology place, looking for assistants"

"You used to want to be an entomologist, I remember you told me about how ants have 2 stomachs, and that the reason why wasps sting more than bees is because they have barbed stingers"

"That was a long time ago, though I guess I applied to there, I was just clining onto a long forgoten dream."

"But you still kept the colony of ants you got 3 years ago"

"First of all, its not just a colony of ants, is a thriving colony of Weaver Ants, it's extremely difficult to keep them. that reminds me, I need to refil their water sources"

"Oh don't worry, I did it for you already, I thought you might've been too tired when you got back"

*Ring* *Ring*

Me and Stacy jumped as we heard the landline twice this day, I quickly ran over to answer it "Hello, W residence"

The person on the phone replied, I guess they were in a area with bad reception I believe they said my name after they introduced themselves"Uh yes this is Matthew W"

"Oh good, we're calling from the >!@$%#%*^!< Entomolgy research company, we have reviewed your resume, and after careful consideration, we have came to the conclusion that you are what we're looking for, the only thing is, you'll need to sign a NDA, also, you say you kept a few colonies of ants?"sss

"Uh yeah, wait what will I be working on that requires a NDA?"

"Excelent, we can't disclose much yet, but you will be working with ants, now tell me more on the colonies you kept"

This seemed odd, they already asked me these questions on the interview form

"I'm sorry, Mr >!@#@$%&,!< but I believe somebody asked me these questions during the interview"

"Ah yes, I guess my memory fades after all the years, anyways, as I see on your resume, you said you can work as soon as possible right?"

"Yes thats correct"

"Wonderful, you can come on Monday for training, then you'll sign the NDA then you can start working officially hopefully on Friday"

>!Entomologists, due to their work with insects and arthropods, are at a higher risk of experiencing allergic reactions, venom reactions, infections, infestations, and even delusional parasitosis!<


"Hey Stacy, I need to go to work, make sure you take your pills" I stop and pause "Twice remember"

"Wait do you have your keys?"

"Yes, also make sure you check on Mrs Arbore today, I think her memories getting worse"

"Ok. . ."



"Goodmorning Mr. W, I see training went well"

I paused, it was Max, the guy who trained me, why is he asking me this?

"I guess so..." I didn't want to seem rude by ingoring him, wait, was this just a joke? I guess it flew over my head. Brushing off that encounter I went into the room I was instructed to so I can put on my labcoat, and then I had to go through the Decontamination process, during my training, I learned on how this place was studying all kinds of diseases and parasites that effect insects, they haven't let me see the exact things they do, they say it's because I haven't signed the NDA yet, but now they told me to walk towards the main lab door where I'll find the room in which I'll assist the entomologists, I mean, it's probably easy, I mean, whats the hardest thing I'll need to do, help disect an ant? If so, I'll need a small scalpel!



This is not what I expected, what are they doing, why are they doing this?! They're bio-engineering the disease's to infect other things, I thought they were joking until they brought out the obviously sick anteater, I asked why they're doing this, they told me it is a goverment funded mission, they say that it will be usefull for warfare, holy shit, isn't there a section in the Geneva convention that against this?!
