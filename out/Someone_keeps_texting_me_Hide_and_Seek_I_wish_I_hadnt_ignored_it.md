I received the first message three days ago. I was on my break at work, and I got a text notification. It was odd, it was from an unknown number. Normally I ignored those sorts of messages, spammers and the like usually showed up with those types of auto texts. But this one was different. It was so strange because no number showed up at all, just the message,

“Hide and seek?”

I thought someone might have the wrong number for a friend they were trying to get in touch with to play a game apparently, so I responded,

“Think you have the wrong number, not sure who you are trying to reach but they are not here.”

I went about the rest of my workday and was just wrapping things up. When I pulled my phone from my bag, I saw I had another text waiting for me, same number, or lack of number. It was Just another blank line where a number should display and the message,

“Hide and seek?.......”

I was confused and slightly annoyed, so I responded again,

“Like I said before I think you have the wrong number. Who is this? Who are you trying to get ahold of to play hide and seek?”

I waited, staring at the screen for a minute and I was about to put it away when I saw a response,

“You.....hide and seek?”

My patience had reached its limit, and I figured if they would not answer then I would just block the non-existent number and hope it would work. Despite the lack of a visible number, the option on the message thread still presented itself, so I was relieved when the weird conversation vanished.

I got in my car and started to drive home. I got another notification as I got on the road and used my cars text to speech to read it to me. It was Mike my roommate. He was asking me to pick up more beer from the store, since he had apparently finished off what we had left.

I groaned at the message and the fact that I was always the one to buy it for us. It was getting old, but I needed a drink after the night I had, so I sent him a message back saying,

“I can this time, but if you are going to keep drinking everything we have then you better start paying for it.”

I stopped by a nearby gas station close to our apartment and grabbed a case of Miller and continued home. As soon as I got back in the car, I received another text. I was getting annoyed already since I figured it was Mike complaining about being out of something else. But instead as the text to speech read out the message, I knew it was something else,

“Seek...drink?”

It made sense now and I immediately called Mike.

He answered after several rings and sounded stoned.

“Hey man what's up? Did you grab the beer?”

“Yeah, I did. Are you messing with me? How are you sending those messages? When I call you, I can see your number, but not when you sent that weird text. What kind of app are you using? Also, what is the point? I am not home yet I can’t play hide and seek, never mind that I’m not five years old. The seek drink thing was a bit of a giveaway for whatever weird game you are playing.”

There was a brief pause, and he responded,

“Not sure what you mean man. I didn't send anything like that. Weird, who wants to play hide and seek? Anyway, get home man, my buzz is fading.” He hung up on me and I was even more confused. If he had not sent the message who did? I drove home, feeling a little on edge.

When I got back inside Mike greeted me at the door. Of course, by greeted, I mean he took the case of beer and walked to the fridge, removed two and sat back down on the couch.

“Nice to see you too.” I mumbled under my breath. I wanted to ask again about the weird message, but I just shrugged and grabbed a drink for myself and lumbered to my room.

I was tired, so I decided to call it an early night. When I stepped into my room my phone buzzed, and I saw another text from no number,

“Almost......time.......hide........or.......seek?”

I was getting creeped out at that point, I did not know how the messages kept getting through after blocking it. I decided to respond again,

“Stop messaging me, I do not know who this is, and I do not want to play. Leave me alone!” I hit send and tried blocking it again. This time I turned my phone off for good measure.

I tried to settle down and just go to sleep.

I managed to nod off for a bit, but after a while I heard a knock at my door. I jolted up and heard the slurring voice of Mike.

“Hey man, I dunno what the hell, but I think someone is trying to get ahold of you. I just got a trippy message, and it sounded like what you were talking about earlier, check it out.”

I rushed to the door and saw Mike looking at his phone in a confused stupor. I grabbed it from him and looked at the message,

“Last.....chance......hide......or......seek?”

My heart sank and I felt a wave of panic rising in my chest.

I asked Mike,

“When did you get this?”

He shrugged his shoulders.

“A while ago man, I don’t remember exactly. I was not looking at my phone, what's going on?”

I stepped back into my room and turned my own phone back on. Sure, enough I had a missed message,

“Okay......you.......hide.”

I stared at the words in mounting fear. I had no idea what to do but I felt suddenly exposed. I considered calling the police, but I did not know what I would tell them. Nothing had happened, only a creepy text thread. Yet something felt wrong, like something bad was about to happen.

I looked over at Mike and he looked confused and a bit paranoid as well. Before I could try and explain things the lights went out. At first, I thought it might be a power outage. Then I heard the slow creaking sound of the front door opening, despite being sure I had locked it when I got home.

Terror gripped me and I knew something was very wrong. I crouched down in the dark and whispered to Mike the only thing I could think to say,

“Hide.”

I crawled on my floor and under my bed. I was about to call 911, when my phone suddenly died as well. It was on one moment and then just lost power, despite having over half a charge left.

I put the useless device in my pocket and tried to see if there was anything I could use as a light source. I froze and thought better about moving when I heard a strange shuffling sound.

Then heavy footsteps, much heavier than Mike’s. I noticed the temperature in the room had dropped suddenly and it felt like it was freezing. As the footsteps resounded and moved closer, I smelled a fetid tinge in the air as well, like something rotten.

I crawled as far back and huddled up as small as I could make myself under the bed and held my breath. I heard my closet door gently shutting and thought it might be Mike hiding in there. Then the heavy footsteps picked up the pace. I suddenly realized if I could hear the door closing, whatever the hell was in here with us could hear it too.

I considered calling out to Mike to move, but fear froze my voice.  The heavy footsteps were in the room now. Despite my efforts to try and see what stalked us, I could not make anything out. I sat there, silent and immobile, holding my breath and waiting.

After several long moments I thought we might be safe, then I heard the door to the closet break and shatter. Then Mike screamed, a haunting and nightmare inducing shriek. Something had found him. The cry of terror was suddenly silenced. I did not hear anything violent, just the scream and then utter silence. I had no idea what the hell had just happened.

For a long while I sat there paralyzed with fear, until finally the light came back on. When I summoned the courage to creep out from under the bed and see what had happened, I was shocked when laying on the ground was the shattered remains of my closet door.

Despite the ruin of the door, there were no traces of anyone or anything else. Mike had vanished. I slowly called out, louder and more emboldened as I moved into the hall where the light was on again. No one responded, no one else was there. I stumbled through the apartment searching for my roommate, but he was gone. Worse still, I had no idea just where the hell he had gone.



No trace of Mike has shown up in the last couple days since it happened. I don’t know if anything will. I think he can finally be declared missing, but I don’t know if it will do any good. It was impossible, but whatever had broken into our place had found him and now he was missing. He had lost hide and seek and that thing, whatever it was took him away. The entire nightmare is unbelievable, yet even now as I write about my friend's impossible disappearance, I am shocked when I receive another text,

“Hide and seek?”

I don’t know what to do, I don’t know what this is.

Maybe I should respond again, a different way this time. Maybe it might help, might keep me safe from whatever, or whoever is doing this. Perhaps I can find out. My reply is one word,

“Seek.”
