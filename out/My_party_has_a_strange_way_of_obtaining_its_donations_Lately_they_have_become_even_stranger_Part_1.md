It is no secret that most major parties receive illegal funds, either to stay afloat or simply to line their pockets. The favor that is then done for the donors is usually always the same.

For example, in parliamentary votes, they vote against phasing out coal, and in return, the coal producers pay abnormally large sums of money, which are then divided up within the party. The amounts paid for simply “not standing up” are beyond imagination; it would be impossible for me to comprehend them.

Of course, all this takes place behind closed doors, and the donors want to remain anonymous, which is why a bank transfer is unfortunately never an option.

That is why each party has different ways of handling these transfers.

We have a “cash service” – each member of parliament has one week in which they must collect the funds from a pre-arranged location – and it is important to follow certain rules, which vary from job to job.

These rules must never be discussed, under any circumstances.

If anyone in a high position within the party hears that the rules of the job have even been discussed, then you can be sure that the consequences will ruin your life or, in some cases, even end it.

I have seen many colleagues come and go—some left voluntarily after their first “money service,” while others broke or betrayed the rules and were kicked out as a result.

 After that, you had to endure numerous smear campaigns in the party-affiliated media.

Every now and then, people would disappear overnight, there would be no trace of them, and the party would come up with an excuse as to why a colleague was no longer coming to work.

For us low-ranking politicians, it was already clear what exactly was happening to our colleagues, but no one wanted to talk about it or address it.

Ultimately, we were and are interchangeable.

We are well paid to keep quiet, distribute votes, and bring new representatives into the fold.

Our pay is so high that we simply close both eyes and turn our backs on these cases. I mean, what other choice do you have in such a situation?

If you speak out against it, you will either be declared a corrupt asshole within the city and the state, or you will disappear from the scene.

In some cases, anonymous tips were sent to the local authorities by the other parties, and they then showed up in front of the party building.

Only Mr. K, our chairman, was ever interrogated. He never allowed anyone to talk to us—the risk was too high that someone would start talking.

Of course, nothing ever came of it—our party has money to burn, and money can buy you any distortion of the truth.

The cases of my missing colleagues range from unsolved disappearances—which, coincidentally, were closed a few years earlier—to suicides that were then dismissed in public as the result of burnout.

I kept quiet and turned a blind eye for 10 years, but it has all gotten so much worse.

In the period before my last “mission,” more and more colleagues either jumped ship or disappeared, more than usual.

The Jobs we had to do were always a little weird - sometimes these money missions could really creep you out but they have never been that much of an issue. So I couldn't comprehend why exactly so many of my co-workers quit or vanished recently.

The missions rarely differed. Drive to a building, pick up the package, and deliver it to a mail slot in the party headquarters. 

The only thing that ever changed were the rules you had to follow.

My close friend, whom I'll call Jason here, was assigned the week before me.

Jason was always a very loyal member of the party; he never questioned anything, worked hard, and you could say he bled our party colors.

He was an extrovert, the kind of person who would approach you on the street without any embarrassment and talk to you as if you had been friends for decades.

We met while studying politics, and he made it his mission early on to bring me out of my introverted bubble—I was, and still am, a very reserved person.

That didn't change after we graduated or after we joined the party. Jason only became quieter when he was no longer able to cope with the task of contraception.

When his son was born, this man turned into a completely different person. However, he never lost his social streak – he was particularly good at campaigning, he won over a lot of people for our mission within the party, and he also won over many voters.

Jason was the last person you would have thought could be broken by anything.

Two weeks ago, he was on “money duty,” and when he came out of the briefing room where he had received the rules, he was pale as a ghost.

When I asked him if everything was okay or if he had gone back to drinking after five years, he just remained silent and gave me a frightened look as he walked away.

That was the last time I saw Jason. 

He didn't come to work the next day, and his face was never seen inside the party building during the rest of the week.

That wasn't like him at all—Jason had never been late since he became a father. Sick leave was also a rarity for him; it always seemed to me that his job kept him healthy.

At the end of the week, we were called together by the party leader—usually we just briefly summarize the week and discuss plans for the coming week, but this time it was completely different.

Mr. K, an old, grim man, stepped out of his office. His glasses, which felt like they were 20 cm thick, caught the last rays of sunlight and shot them into the middle of the room.

His expression was as cold as ice – you always had the feeling that the room got 2 to 3 degrees Celsius colder when he stepped out of his office once a week.

He cleared his throat and informed us with his authoritative gaze and still emotionless voice that Jason and his family had moved away and we would now be filling his position.

He tried to deliver this news as if he cared even one percent—but he failed repeatedly.

You could always tell that his employees were just interchangeable numbers on a piece of paper to him.

His rough voice carried through the large building, and he mentioned casually, as if it were information that didn't deserve more than two words, that he would be looking for a replacement and expected us all to be in the office on Monday as usual.

Mr. K glanced around the room once more, turned around, crept into his office, and said goodbye to us with a loud slam of his door.

This news had to sink in first, and it took a really long time. It wasn't until I got home that I realized Jason had been removed by the party.

A tear rolled down my cheek, and I wondered what Jason had done wrong.

What rule had he broken? What exactly was his task this week? My head was at war with itself for a long time, and it proved extremely difficult to think clearly.

For some reason, after a while, Jason's wife, Maria, popped into my head.

I just had to call her; even if it was only to get confirmation on the moving theory, that would have been enough for me to at least tell my head that Jason was still on this earth.

I picked up the phone and called her, and after a short delay, she actually answered the phone.

“Maria? Maria? Are you there?”

“Why are you calling, Mike?”

"Why am I calling? Are you kidding me? What about Jason? Why isn't he coming to work anymore? Why am I hearing from my boss that you guys are moving out of nowhere? Maria, what the hell is going on with you guys?

She was silent for what felt like an eternity—at one point I thought the connection might have been broken, but then I heard a quiet sob.

"Mike, we're *moving*; just understand. We don't want to be here anymore; this place, no, this party is ruining our lives... has already ruined our lives. What do you think this is all about? Make sure you do the same and leave the country, and make sure you don't leave the party like Jason did."

“What the hell are you talking about, what do you mean?”

“Goodbye, Mikey, don't ever call here again.”

I shouted her name a few more times into my phone, but unfortunately there was no answer on the other end. Maria didn't respond to any further calls. 

Jason's number no longer worked.

There was no voicemail, just an automated message from his phone provider informing me that the number was no longer in service.

Shock is a term I wouldn't use to describe this situation.

I couldn't even begin to describe how I felt—I sat motionless in my living room, and slowly my brain began to process the conversation with Jason's wife.

The phrases “ruined our lives” and “do as I do” ran through my head until I slowly came to a decision.

Jason had been eliminated, and Maria fled the country because she feared for her well-being.

I trembled as a new thought entered my mind—when is my next “money service”?

As if remote-controlled, I got up and moved toward my kitchen.

My calendar was on the dark dining table, and when I turned on the light in the room, I saw large red letters smiling at me on the row for the next week, letting me know that it was my turn to earn money.

It may have been paranoia, but I could have sworn that this entry in the calendar wasn't mine.

I never wrote with a red pen, especially not on my calendar, because the color bleeds through.

I also felt like I was being watched.

You probably know that feeling when someone is staring at you from a distance, so much so that it gives you goosebumps. Were those the first warning signs?

Maybe, but my mental overload did its best to prevent me from noticing these signals.

The weekend flew by. I didn't relax, and if someone had asked me what I had been doing, I probably wouldn't have been able to give an answer that was even remotely credible.

I hadn't been in the party building for a minute when I was summoned to the briefing room.

This room was a small chamber with a black armchair and a small coffee table in the middle, on which layed an envelope labeled “Rules.”

The air was thick and the atmosphere, even though I was the only one in the room, was tense. The letter and I engaged in a duel in which I was already destined to be the loser.

My hand trembled as it made its way to the envelope, and when I pulled it off the table with a jerky movement, I felt something in the back of my neck.

A cold breath, as if a corpse were standing behind me. Terror overwhelmed me and robbed me of the ability to move my legs. The breath on my neck came rhythmically and slowly spread through my entire body.

I had probably only been standing in that room for a minute, but time passed much more slowly for me.

I hadn't regained control of my body; my legs switched to autopilot and turned me toward the door against my will. There was nothing behind me—a loud sigh of relieve escaped my lungs and I slowly began to calm down.

“It's all in your head, it's all in your head.”

These words keept running through my mind. I hardly slept at all, so of course I was just imagining everything. Right?

As I grabbed the door handle, I felt that cold breath on my neck one last time, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something or someone was reaching for my shoulder. I lost my balance slightly and tilted to the left, the cold moved from my neck to my shoulder, and I felt as if I were freezing to death.

It all became too much for me, I pushed the door open and slammed it behind me, I sank slightly to my knees and was greeted by the questioning and judgmental looks of my colleagues. A few of them even giggled.

If I had been in my right mind, I would have grabbed them and locked them in the briefing room so they could experience for themselves what it was like in there, but I didn't. On the contrary, I forced myself to my feet, put on a fake, feigned laugh, and left my workplace.

The letter never made it out of the building; I threw that damn piece of trash in a garbage can. I don't care about any of it, let the party demonize me across the country. At that point, I didn't care about anything anymore. I'm not going back there. Why should I?

The thought of taking the whole thing to the press flashed through my mind and fought with the thought of simply leaving the country and starting a new life. Nothing is keeping me here anyway.

For the first time since Friday, I was overcome by a calming feeling—as if all paths were open to me.
