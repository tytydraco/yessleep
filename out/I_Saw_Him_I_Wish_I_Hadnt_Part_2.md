[Link to part one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/KaeUw2f4e2)

I don’t even remember the drive home. My hands were locked on the wheel, knuckles white, sweat dripping down my forehead. My stomach churned, but I didn’t stop, didn’t pull over—I just needed to get away. Away from the gas station, from that parking lot, from him.

The name echoed in my head like a goddamn curse. He said it so casually, like it was supposed to mean something. Like it was supposed to stick. And it did.

The smell of burnt flesh lingered in my nostrils, thick and acrid, no matter how many times I rolled the windows down. Every time I blinked, I saw that man’s face—twisted in shock and pain, the glowing red beams punching through his chest and leaving nothing but smoke and silence.

By the time I got back to my apartment, my legs were shaking so badly I could barely climb the stairs. I fumbled with my keys, dropped them twice, and finally shoved the door open. The second I stepped inside, I locked the door, bolted it, and pushed a chair under the handle for good measure.

I collapsed onto the couch, my heart pounding in my chest. My hands were still trembling, my palms slick with sweat. My brain kept screaming, This isn’t real. This can’t be real.

But it was real.

I grabbed my phone, desperate for… something. Answers, maybe? I don’t know what I thought I’d find, but I started searching. “Man with glowing eyes.” “Laser vision kills.” “Sonic boom sound.” Every search brought up nothing but comic book characters and fake conspiracy theories.

The world didn’t even know he existed.

I didn’t sleep. Not really. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw his face, that goddamn smirk, those eyes that burned like molten steel.

In one dream—or maybe it was real—I was back at the gas station. The parking lot was empty, silent, except for the hum of the neon sign. I turned, and there he was, standing just a few feet away, his hands shoved into his hoodie pockets.

“Still scared?” he asked, his voice calm, almost playful.

I couldn’t move, couldn’t speak.

“You should be,” he said, his grin widening. “This is only the beginning.”

I woke up drenched in sweat, gasping for air. The room was silent, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone. I sat there for hours, staring at the door, waiting for the knock I knew was coming.

The next day, I tried to go to work. I thought maybe if I could get back to some kind of routine, I could forget about him. But nothing felt right.

The fluorescent lights in the gas station were too bright, the hum of the coolers too loud. Every time a customer walked in, I flinched, expecting to see him standing there, grinning at me from behind the counter.

By the time my shift ended, my nerves were shot. I drove home in silence, every shadow on the road making my heart jump.

When I got back to my apartment, I found the door unlocked.

I stopped cold, my breath hitching in my throat. I knew I’d locked it—I knew I had.

Slowly, I pushed the door open, my hands trembling. The apartment was quiet, but something felt wrong. The air was heavy, the kind of pressure that makes your ears pop.

“Hello?” I called out, my voice barely above a whisper.

No response.

I stepped inside, every nerve in my body screaming at me to turn around and leave. But I couldn’t. I had to know.

The living room was empty. So was the kitchen. I checked the bathroom, the bedroom, every closet. Nothing.

But when I came back to the living room, I saw it.

Scrawled across the wall in black marker, messy and uneven, were two words:

“Still watching.”

I didn’t sleep that night. How could I? He was in my apartment. He was here. He was playing with me, watching me, waiting for the right moment to show up and ruin my life all over again.

The next morning, I packed a bag. Clothes, cash, a flashlight, anything I could think of. I didn’t have a plan—I just needed to get out.

As I was stuffing the bag into my car, I heard it again. That low, rumbling sound, like a sonic boom in the distance.

My blood ran cold.

I turned, my heart pounding in my chest, and there he was.

He was standing across the parking lot, leaning casually against a lamppost. His eyes weren’t glowing this time, but that smirk was still there, sharp and cruel.

“Going somewhere?” he called out, his voice carrying easily across the lot.

I froze. My hands clenched into fists, my entire body trembling with a mix of fear and rage. “What do you want from me?” I shouted.

He pushed off the lamppost and started walking toward me, his hands in his hoodie pockets. “You know,” he said, tilting his head, “you ask that a lot. It’s almost like you think this is about you.”

“It’s not?” I asked, my voice shaking.

He laughed, shaking his head. “Oh, man. You really don’t get it, do you? This isn’t some grand plan, some master scheme. This is just me… having fun.”

“Why me?” I demanded.

He stopped a few feet away, looking me up and down like I was some kind of joke. “Why not?” he said, grinning.

I don’t know what came over me, but I snapped. “Fuck you,” I spat. “I’m not your toy. I’m not going to keep letting you do this to me.”

His grin widened, and for the first time, his eyes began to glow, faint but unmistakable. “Oh, you’re not? That’s cute.”

Before I could react, he reached out, grabbing the bag from my car. He cocked his arm back and threw it across the lot like it weighed nothing, the contents scattering everywhere.

I stumbled back, my heart pounding.

“You’re not going anywhere,” he said, his voice low and dangerous. “Not until I decide I’m done with you.”

“Bud, if I wanted you dead, you’d be dead by now.”

His voice was calm, almost bored, but it hit me like a punch to the gut. He tilted his head, that smirk never leaving his face. “And I see you tried to tell my story on Reddit a few months ago. Too bad it didn’t get much attention, huh?”

My heart sank. My chest tightened, and it felt like the air had been sucked out of the parking lot. How the hell did he know? My mind was racing, trying to make sense of it. Who was this guy? What was he?

Before I could even open my mouth to ask, he cut me off with a mocking laugh. “I have an iPhone, dumbass.”

I froze, staring at him. That… made no sense. What did that even mean? My confusion must’ve been written all over my face because he leaned in closer, his smirk widening.

“Oh, come on,” he said, rolling his eyes. “What, you think I don’t keep up? You think I’m some, what, ancient cryptid who doesn’t know how to Google his name? Newsflash: I love seeing how people talk about me. Keeps me entertained. And you?” He pointed at me, his tone dripping with mockery. “You, my little chronicler, didn’t exactly light up the internet with your story, did you?”

I stammered, trying to find words, but nothing came out.

He laughed again, shaking his head like I was some kind of joke. “Oh, don’t feel bad. It was a good read. A little melodramatic, but hey, points for effort. I mean, you really tried to make me sound scary.” He stepped closer, his eyes narrowing. “But do you know what’s actually scary?”

I swallowed hard, my throat dry. “What?”

“This,” he said, and in a blur, he was standing inches away from me, his face so close I could see the faint glow of his eyes reflecting off my own. “The fact that I’m standing here right now. That no matter what you write, what you think, or what you do, I’ll always know. And you? You’ll never know what’s coming next.”

I stumbled back, my heart pounding in my chest.

“Don’t bother trying to delete the post,” he added, his smirk returning. “I already screenshotted it. Thought it’d be funny to keep for the memories.”

I couldn’t speak. My mind was spinning, my legs trembling.

“Relax,” he said, stepping back and shrugging. “I’m not gonna kill you. Like I said, if I wanted you dead, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation. But you’ve got potential, bud. You’re entertaining. And I like entertaining things.”

I couldn’t stop myself. “Why? Why me?”

Lavoix let out an exaggerated groan, throwing his head back like I’d just told the lamest joke in history. “Why do you always say ‘why me’? Seriously, bud, you sound like a fucking broken record.” He stared at me, his smirk widening into something sharper, more condescending. “Do you think if you keep asking, I’m just gonna suddenly go, ‘Oh, you’re right! My bad, wrong guy!’ and fuck off? Is that the plan here?”

I opened my mouth to respond, but my brain was too scrambled to come up with anything. Finally, I just mumbled, “I don’t… I don’t know what else to say.”

Lavoix snorted, shaking his head like I was the most pitiful thing he’d ever seen. “You don’t know what else to say? Really? Out of all the words in the English language, that’s what you’re going with? Christ, you’re even more boring than I thought.”

He started pacing lazily, hands in his hoodie pockets, his voice dripping with mockery as he continued. “You could’ve asked me literally anything, y’know. Like, ‘What are you?’ Or, ‘How do I make you leave me alone?’ Hell, even a ‘Please don’t hurt me’ would’ve been more original than why me.”

I felt the heat rising in my face, equal parts fear and humiliation. “I don’t know!” I snapped, my voice cracking. “I just… I don’t know why this is happening. I don’t know what you want from me!”

He stopped pacing and turned to face me, his smirk softening into something… different. Almost pitying. Almost. “Oh, buddy,” he said, shaking his head. “That’s the thing—you don’t get it. I don’t want anything from you. This isn’t some cosmic karmic punishment, or some secret destiny bullshit. You’re just… there. And I’m just… bored.”

He paused, letting the weight of his words sink in before leaning in slightly, his glowing eyes narrowing as he spoke. “You’re not the main character in some grand story. You’re just the poor schmuck who happened to walk into mine.”

My stomach twisted, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might break through my chest. I couldn’t tell if I was angry, terrified, or both.

And just like that, the smirk snapped back onto his face. “But hey,” he said, his voice light and teasing, “if you keep asking ‘why me,’ I might just laser your fucking head off for variety. At least that would be something new, huh?”

I gritted my teeth and forced the words out before I could stop myself. “If you were gonna ‘laser my head off,’ you would’ve done it by now. So what do you achieve by saying this? Do you think you’re scaring me? Because I’m not afraid of you anymore.”

The moment the words left my mouth, I felt the air change. Lavoix’s smirk froze for a split second before it shifted—wider, sharper, like a wolf spotting its prey. He tilted his head, his glowing eyes narrowing as he stepped closer, slow and deliberate.

“You’re not afraid of me anymore?” he repeated, his voice low and mockingly soft. “That’s a big statement, bud. Really big. I mean, I’d clap for you, but…” He raised his hands, fingers twitching slightly. “I might accidentally crush your tiny little ego.”

I stood my ground, even though my legs were shaking so bad it felt like they’d give out any second. “Yeah,” I said, forcing the words past the lump in my throat. “You keep talking about how much power you have, but all you do is threaten me and play these games. If you’re so untouchable, why not just do it?”

His eyes flared brighter, and for a moment, I thought I’d crossed a line I shouldn’t have. But instead of exploding—or, you know, lasering my head off—he laughed. Loud, sharp, and so sudden it made me flinch.

“Holy shit, you’ve got some balls after all!” he said, doubling over as if it was the funniest thing he’d ever heard. “Man, I almost feel bad for what’s coming next. Almost.”

He straightened up, wiping an imaginary tear from his eye, and leaned in close, so close I could feel the heat radiating off him. His voice dropped to a whisper, deadly calm and dripping with menace. “Let me explain something to you, buddy. You’re not not afraid of me. You’re just stupid enough to think this is bravery. And you know what? That’s fine. I like it when people try to act tough. Makes it so much more fun when I break them.”

I didn’t move. I couldn’t. My chest was tight, my heart pounding so loud I thought he’d hear it.

“Not afraid of me,” he muttered, shaking his head with a grin. “That’s cute. Really, it is. But let me give you a little reminder.”

Before I could react, he reached out and grabbed the chair I had been sitting on. With zero effort, he squeezed it in his hand, the wood groaning and splintering until it collapsed into a pile of broken pieces. He let the remains drop to the ground and leaned in even closer.

“You don’t have to be afraid of me,” he said, his voice low and ice-cold. “But you’re gonna wish you were.”

And with that, he stepped back, that smirk plastered across his face again. “Anyway, I’ll see you around, champ. Don’t get too comfortable.”

He was gone in the blink of an eye, leaving me standing there, staring at the pile of broken wood and shaking like a leaf.

I wanted to believe what I’d said. I wanted to believe I wasn’t afraid anymore.

But deep down, I knew I was lying.

The next day, I dragged myself to work, desperate for some kind of normalcy. My shift at the convenience store was mind-numbing as always—ringing up cigarettes, stocking shelves, cleaning up spilled soda from aisle two. It was the kind of monotony I used to hate, but now, I’d take it over the constant feeling of being hunted.

For most of the day, nothing happened. Customers came and went, oblivious to my barely-contained anxiety. I started convincing myself that maybe, just maybe, he was done with me. That what he said yesterday was just more of his twisted games.

Then, with about thirty minutes left in my shift, the door’s bell jingled, and I froze.

It was him.

He strolled in like he owned the place, his hoodie pulled over his head, his hands stuffed casually in his sweatpants pockets. That smirk—the one that made my stomach turn—was plastered across his face.

“Afternoon, champ,” he said, his voice cutting through the silence like a knife.

I swallowed hard, forcing myself to keep my expression neutral. “What do you want?”

“What, no ‘welcome to the store’? No ‘how can I help you today’? Man, your customer service sucks,” he said, chuckling as he wandered down the aisles.

I clenched my fists, my palms slick with sweat, and kept my eyes on him as he lazily browsed the shelves. He picked up a pack of gum, turning it over in his hands like it was the most fascinating thing in the world.

“You know,” he said, not looking at me, “I’ve been thinking about what you said yesterday. About how you’re not afraid of me anymore.”

I didn’t respond. I just watched him, my heart pounding in my chest.

“I gotta say,” he continued, tossing the gum back onto the shelf, “that was ballsy. Stupid as hell, but ballsy. So, I figured I’d stop by and see how that new ‘fearless you’ is holding up.”

He turned to me, his glowing eyes faint but unmistakable. “Spoiler alert: you don’t look fearless.”

“What do you want from me?” I said through gritted teeth.

He grinned, walking up to the counter and leaning on it like we were old friends. “I told you already: nothing. You’re the one who keeps asking that dumbass question. I’m just here for the vibes, man. To hang out. Keep you on your toes. Y’know, make sure you don’t get too comfortable.”

I stared at him, my hands shaking as I gripped the edge of the counter. “You can’t keep doing this.”

“Can’t I?” he said, raising an eyebrow. “Who’s gonna stop me? You?” He laughed, loud and sharp. “Yeah, sure, buddy. Go ahead. Stop me. Right here, right now. I dare you.”

I didn’t move.

“That’s what I thought,” he said, his grin widening. He straightened up and gestured around the store. “Relax. I’m not here to burn the place down or melt your face off. I’m just… curious. Wanted to see where you work, what you do. And now that I have, I gotta say…” He glanced around at the dingy shelves and flickering fluorescent lights. “Wow. This is depressing as hell.”

I clenched my fists tighter. “If you’re just here to insult me, you can leave.”

“Oh, but then I’d miss all the fun,” he said, leaning forward again. His voice dropped, low and taunting. “Here’s the thing, bud. You don’t get to tell me what to do. This is my world. You’re just living in it.”

I opened my mouth to respond, but before I could say anything, a customer walked in—a middle-aged man in a business suit.

“Afternoon,” the man said, glancing between me and Lavoix before heading toward the coffee station.

Lavoix didn’t take his eyes off me. “Tell you what,” he said, his voice soft but menacing. “I’ll let you finish your shift. I’m feeling generous today. But don’t get too comfy, champ. I’ll be back.”

And just like that, he was gone. One second he was standing there, and the next, the door jingled as it swung shut behind him, though I never saw him leave.

The customer came up to the counter, a cup of coffee in hand, and gave me a weird look. “You alright?” he asked.

I nodded stiffly, forcing a weak smile as I rang him up.

But I wasn’t alright. Not even close. Because I knew he meant it.

Many of you might not believe what I’m about to say next. Hell, if I were reading this, I probably wouldn’t either. But I swear on my life, on everything I’ve ever known, that this happened. It sounds impossible—like something ripped out of a comic book or a bad movie—but it’s real. And it’s terrifying.

When I was walking to my car after my shift ended, I saw him again. Lavoix. He was leaning against my car like he’d been waiting for me, his arms crossed and that ever-present smirk on his face.

“Long day?” he asked casually, as if we were friends meeting up after work.

I stopped dead in my tracks, my heart racing. “What do you want now?”

He pushed himself off the car and started pacing in front of me, his hands in his hoodie pockets. “You’re always so tense. Relax, bud. I’m not here to mess with you—well, not just to mess with you. I figured it’s time we had a little chat. A heart-to-heart, y’know?”

I didn’t respond, just stared at him as he continued.

“You’ve probably figured out some of my tricks by now,” he said, his eyes faintly glowing as he gestured toward himself. “But let me lay it out for you, just so we’re clear. I’m not like you. I’m stronger, faster, tougher. I can fly, I can shoot lasers out of my eyes—you’ve seen that firsthand—and if I wanted to, I could break every bone in your body before you even blink.”

My throat went dry, but I forced myself to stay calm.

“And here’s the fun part,” he continued, leaning in slightly. “Time isn’t exactly… linear for me. If I want to, I can go back, forward, sideways—whatever. Your little ‘clock’ doesn’t mean shit to me.”

“You can… time travel?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

“Bingo,” he said, grinning. “But it’s not as simple as hopping into a DeLorean. You’ve gotta hit a certain speed—fast enough to break the rules, y’know? And lucky me, I’m just fast enough to make it work.”

My head was spinning. This couldn’t be real. It just couldn’t.

“So, here’s the deal,” he said, stepping closer. “You’ve got questions, right? About why I do what I do, why I picked you, all that ‘why me’ crap you love so much. Well, let’s go find some answers. Let’s take a little trip.”

“A trip?” I asked, frowning. “To where?”

“To when,” he corrected, his smirk widening. “January 21st. A couple months back. You remember that day, don’t you?”

I froze, my mind racing. January 21st. That was the day I first saw him. The day everything started.

“Why?” I asked.

“Let’s just say I have a feeling you’re gonna find it… enlightening,” he said, his tone dripping with amusement. “Now, you can come willingly, or I can drag you along kicking and screaming. Your call.”

I wanted to tell him to go to hell, but something in his voice, in the way he said it, made me hesitate. Against my better judgment, I nodded.

“Alright,” he said, clapping his hands together. “Buckle up, champ. This is gonna be a wild ride.”

“Buckle up, champ. This is gonna be a wild ride,” Lavoix said with a grin. Before I could ask what the hell that meant, he grabbed me—literally scooped me up in his arms like I weighed nothing—and the world vanished.

It wasn’t just fast. It was incomprehensible.

One second, I was standing on solid ground, the cold night air on my face, and the next, everything around me dissolved into a blur. It wasn’t like running or even falling—it was something entirely beyond explanation. I couldn’t move, couldn’t scream, couldn’t even think. The sheer speed of it was overwhelming, like my body had been ripped out of reality itself and hurled into some impossible void.

And that’s when I saw it.

The tunnel.

At least, that’s what my brain wants to call it, but nothing about it made sense. It wasn’t a tunnel in the way you think of one—it wasn’t cylindrical, it wasn’t confined. It was infinite. A kaleidoscope of colors, shapes, and patterns stretched out in every direction, folding and twisting in ways that shouldn’t be possible.

The colors… I don’t even have words for them. They weren’t colors you’d see in a sunset or a rainbow. They weren’t colors you could paint or recreate on a screen. These were hues that didn’t belong in this universe, shades that made my eyes water and my brain ache just trying to process them. They shifted constantly, blending into each other, forming new colors that I didn’t even know could exist.

And the shapes. Jesus Christ, the shapes. They defied logic. They defied reality. Some of them looked solid, others looked fluid, and some were both at the same time. They’d stretch and compress, fold into themselves, and then unfold in ways that made my stomach churn. It was like looking at geometry through the lens of madness.

For a moment, I thought, This is it. I’ve lost my mind. This is what it feels like to go insane.

The only thing I could compare it to was an acid trip—but no, that doesn’t even come close. I’ve dabbled with psychedelics before. I’ve seen the swirling colors, the melting edges of the world. But this? This wasn’t like LSD, or shrooms, or DMT, or any drug you could find in this life. No substance on Earth could make you feel what I felt in that tunnel. It was like I was staring at the raw fabric of existence—seeing reality stripped bare, its guts on full display, and it was too much. My brain wasn’t built for it.

I couldn’t breathe. The air wasn’t air anymore; it was something denser, thicker, like the pressure of being miles underwater. My chest felt like it might implode. My eyes watered, not just from the wind whipping past us but from the sheer wrongness of what I was seeing.

“Hang tight!” Lavoix yelled, his voice cutting through the madness, smug and carefree like this was nothing to him. His grip on me tightened as he sped up—sped up—and somehow, impossibly, it got faster.

The shapes started folding inward, spiraling toward a single point ahead of us. It was like we were rushing toward the center of the universe, the very heart of time itself. I wanted to close my eyes, to shut it out, but I couldn’t. I was transfixed, terrified, and helpless.

And then, just as quickly as it had started, it stopped.

The colors vanished. The shapes were gone. And we were standing in the parking lot of my apartment complex.

The cold air hit me like a slap to the face, and I stumbled, barely catching myself before falling to the ground. My legs felt like jelly, my chest heaving as I tried to suck in breaths.

I looked around, my heart still racing, and that’s when I realized it wasn’t March 15th anymore.

It was January 21st, 2025. Though, I had no idea yet.

“Where the fuck were we?!” I gasped, doubling over as my knees threatened to give out. My voice was hoarse, my chest heaving like I’d just run a marathon I didn’t sign up for.

Lavoix, of course, looked completely unfazed, standing there with his hands casually stuffed in his hoodie pockets, his smirk plastered across his face like he’d just finished a Sunday stroll.

“You liked that?” he asked, tilting his head, his voice smug. “Pretty trippy, huh?”

“Trippy?!” I snapped, my voice cracking. “What the fuck was that? Where the fuck were we?! That wasn’t normal! That wasn’t fucking… anything!”

He laughed, shaking his head. “Man, you humans are so dramatic. Alright, fine, I’ll explain it, but you might want to sit down. Not that it’ll help your little pea brain wrap around it.”

I glared at him, but I didn’t argue. My legs were trembling so badly I half-considered actually sitting down.

“Okay, so here’s the deal,” he said, gesturing with his hands like a teacher explaining quantum physics to a kindergartner. “That place we just went through? That’s… let’s call it the time tunnel. Sounds cool, right? Basically, it’s what you get when you break the speed of light and start fucking with time itself.”

I stared at him, my mind struggling to catch up. “The… time tunnel?”

“Yeah,” he said, rolling his eyes. “It’s not a real tunnel, genius. It’s more like a… layer of reality. When you move fast enough—like, really fast—you stop playing by the normal rules. You punch through space and time, and what you saw back there? That’s the in-between. The guts of reality. The place where all the boring shit—like physics—stops working the way you think it should.”

I felt my stomach churn at the memory of those colors, those impossible shapes. “That… that was the in-between?”

“Bingo,” he said, snapping his fingers. “Most people can’t handle seeing it, but lucky for you, I kept you in one piece. You’re welcome, by the way.”

I wanted to throw up. “It felt like I was gonna… I don’t know, fall apart. Like my brain couldn’t even handle looking at it.”

“Yeah, that tracks,” Lavoix said with a shrug. “It’s not meant for you. You’re like a cheap phone trying to run next-gen graphics—you overheat just trying to process it. But me? I’m built for it. I can zip through that place all day and not even break a sweat.”

I stared at him, the weight of his words sinking in. “So… you can just do that? Anytime you want?”

“Pretty much,” he said, grinning. “But it’s not like I take a scenic tour every day. It’s a tool, y’know? A way to get from now to then without having to sit in traffic or deal with your stupid human concept of time.”

“This is insane,” I muttered, shaking my head. “This is completely fucking insane.”

“Welcome to my world,” Lavoix said, spreading his arms dramatically. “Or, y’know, the timeline I let you live in. You should feel special. Most people don’t get to see that place and live to talk about it.”

I didn’t feel special. I felt small. Insignificant. Like I was standing next to something so far beyond me that it could crush me without a second thought.

And the worst part? He knew it.

“But why January 21st?” I demanded, my voice shaking with frustration. “What’s so special about this day? Why’d you bring me back here?”

Lavoix’s smirk widened, his glowing eyes narrowing just slightly. “Well,” he said, drawing out the word like he was savoring it, “you haven’t made a part two to your story yet. And so many people asked you to do so—figured I’d give you a little creative inspiration.”

I blinked, my confusion quickly boiling into anger. “So this is all about you?”

He raised an eyebrow, amused. “Of course it’s about me. Who else would it be about? You?”

“That’s… pathetic,” I snapped, cutting him off. “You just want attention? That’s what this is? You’re screwing with my life, dragging me through some psychedelic nightmare, just so you can get your ego stroked? Jesus Christ, you’re worse than I thought.”

For a moment, his smirk froze, and the air seemed to thicken. His eyes flared briefly, the glow intensifying, and I felt a shiver crawl down my spine. Then, to my surprise, he laughed.

“Pathetic?” he repeated, his voice sharp with mockery. “I’m pathetic? You’re standing here, in the middle of time itself, because I brought you here. You wouldn’t even know what pathetic is without me, bud.”

He leaned in, his face inches from mine, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. “You’re not wrong, though. I do like the attention. But don’t get it twisted. This isn’t about needing anything from you. This is about me choosing to make you squirm because it’s fun. And right now? You’re doing a great job of entertaining me.”

I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms as I glared at him. “So what happens now? You just keep playing your little games until you get bored?”

“Bingo,” he said, grinning like a kid who’d just won a prize. “But hey, look on the bright side—at least your story has a part two now.”

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t. The sheer arrogance, the cruelty of it, was suffocating. And yet, deep down, I knew he wasn’t lying. This was his game, and I was just a piece on the board.

“Anyway,” he said, stepping back and cracking his neck, “we’ve got some time to kill. Let’s see if you can make it interesting.”

I don’t know what came over me after that. Maybe it was exhaustion, or maybe I’d finally reached the point where fear just didn’t have room to live in my head anymore. But instead of arguing, instead of yelling or throwing more insults, I just sighed.

“Fine,” I muttered.

Lavoix blinked, his smirk faltering for the first time. “Fine?”

“Yeah, fine,” I said, rubbing my temples. “You win. I get it. You’re stronger than me, smarter than me, faster than me, whatever. You’ve made your point. So, what now? Are we just going to keep bouncing around time while you stroke your ego, or is there an actual plan here?”

For a second, he just stared at me, clearly caught off guard. Then, to my surprise, he laughed—a real, genuine laugh, not the mocking kind I was used to.

“Holy shit,” he said, shaking his head. “I didn’t think you had it in you. Looks like the little human’s finally growing a backbone.”

“Yeah, well,” I said, crossing my arms, “if you’re going to keep dragging me into your bullshit, I might as well make the best of it.”

“Make the best of it?” he repeated, his grin returning. “I like that. Alright, bud, let’s call it a truce. For now.”

“Truce?” I raised an eyebrow. “What does that even mean with someone like you?”

“It means,” he said, shrugging, “I’ll stop messing with your head as much. And in return, you stop whining about ‘why me’ every five minutes. Deal?”

I hesitated, trying to read his expression. As much as I hated him, I couldn’t deny that he wasn’t exactly what I’d expected. He wasn’t just some mindless monster. There was… something else.

“Deal,” I said finally.

He clapped his hands together. “Now we’re talking! Who knows, this might even be fun.”

I rolled my eyes, but I couldn’t help the small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth. “Yeah, fun. Sure.”

For the next few hours—or maybe it was minutes, or days, because time didn’t seem to mean anything around him—we talked. Not about anything serious, at least not at first. He’d crack jokes about how slow humans were, or how boring my job was, and I’d throw back half-hearted jabs about his need for attention.

It was… strange. Almost normal.

At one point, as we sat on the curb outside my apartment, he looked up at the sky and said, “You know, it’s not all bad being me. Sure, I could crush everything around me if I wanted to, but… sometimes it’s nice to just sit and watch.”

“That’s the first non-asshole thing I’ve ever heard you say,” I said, half-laughing.

“Don’t get used to it,” he shot back, smirking.

It wasn’t friendship—not exactly. But for the first time since I’d met him, I didn’t feel like he was going to destroy me at any moment. And that was… something.

“So, what happens now?” I asked, looking over at him.

He leaned back, his hands behind his head, and grinned. “Now? Now we figure out how to make this timeline interesting.”

“No,” I said firmly, standing up and brushing off the curb dirt. “You brought me here for a reason. You want me to tell people about you. Admit it—this is your chance to become known in the world, to stop hiding in the shadows like some… cosmic prankster.”

Lavoix snorted, rolling his eyes so hard it looked like they might get stuck. “If I wanted to be known, I would’ve been already,” he said, his tone dripping with condescension. “Trust me, bud, it’s not exactly hard to get attention when you can blow up a building by blinking.”

“Then why all this?” I snapped, gesturing wildly. “Why bring me here? Why mess with me in the first place? If you’re not trying to make a name for yourself, then what the hell are you doing?”

He stood up lazily, brushing imaginary dust off his hoodie. “What am I doing? I’m living, man. That’s the whole point. You think I need the world to know my name to feel validated? That’s such a you problem.”

I clenched my fists, frustrated at his nonchalance. “Then why me? Why any of this?”

Lavoix leaned in closer, that smirk back in full force. “Because I like you, bud. You’ve got… potential. You’re boring, sure, but you’ve got that spark. The way you fight back, even when you know you’re outclassed? That’s entertaining as hell. You think I’d waste this much effort on someone I didn’t find interesting?”

I took a step back, trying to process his words. “So, what? You’re just keeping me around for laughs?”

“Pretty much,” he said with a shrug. “And because, whether you admit it or not, you’re learning. Every time you push back, every time you try to figure me out, you’re getting stronger. Smarter. Maybe even a little… like me.”

The thought sent a shiver down my spine. “I’m nothing like you.”

“Not yet,” he said, his grin widening. “But who knows? Maybe you’ll surprise me.”

I shook my head, sitting back down on the curb. “You’re insane, you know that?”

“Yeah,” he said, sitting beside me again. “But at least I’m honest about it.”

“I’d rather you be honest than sugarcoat it,” I said, exhaling sharply.

Lavoix grinned wider, leaning back like he was basking in my reluctant acceptance. “See? You get me! This is why you’re still around. There’s potential in you, even if you don’t see it yet.” He stretched his arms above his head like this whole situation was nothing more than a casual hangout.

“Anyways,” he continued, standing up with that same effortless swagger, “I’ll leave you be for now. Go write that second part. Post it, get your clicks or whatever, then come talk to me. We’ve got more fun ahead.”

And just like that, he was gone. No dramatic exit, no flash of light. One second he was standing there, and the next, he wasn’t.

I sat there on the curb, staring at the spot where he’d been, my head spinning. How do you even process something like this? The fact that I’m writing it all down right now feels… absurd. But I need to, because if I don’t, I think I’ll go insane.

It’s January 21, 2025. I don’t know how to explain it, but somehow, Lavoix brought me back here—back to this date, months before my reality. He told me to write this, to post it, and I know how ridiculous that sounds. I know no one will believe me.

But it’s the truth.

I don’t know why he’s keeping me here in the past, or if he even plans on bringing me back to where I came from. Hell, maybe he doesn’t even know. To him, it’s probably just another game, another way to screw with me.

The thing is, it doesn’t feel like a game to me. If I’m stuck here, if I’m forced to live these next few months over again, it’s going to feel… wasted. Like I’m running in circles, watching my life play out with the knowledge that none of it is really mine anymore.

But here’s the kicker: I don’t think he cares. To Lavoix, I’m just a passing amusement, a distraction. And maybe that’s all I’ll ever be.

So, here it is. Part two, like he wanted. Believe me or don’t—I don’t care anymore. Him and I are still in our past, and I don’t know if I’ll ever get back to my present.

If Lavoix lets me, maybe I’ll write more. But for now, all I can do is wait. And wonder. And hope that, somehow, I’ll find a way to escape this nightmare.

But honestly? I don’t think I will.
