My family is “blind”. I put quotation marks around blind because it wouldn’t be the type of blind your thinking of. They don’t have impaired vision or total blindness/loss of vision and can’t see anything, instead, they can’t open their eyes at all.

After moving to the new house, within 5 days, they all ended up catching this condition where they can’t open their eyes, one by one, and after waking up. First  was my brother, who woke up not being able to open his eyes. Then the next day it was my sister, the day after my sister was my mother, and the rampage ended with my dad also catching the condition the day after my mom caught it.

Friends and family don’t have a clue. Medical professionals suggested by close relatives don’t have enough information  to identify the clear cause of such a condition.
I was the only one who wasn’t affected, which came with pros and cons. Obviously I can see, but now I have to live with the guilt with receiving the luxury of being able to have the gift of vision, and I have to be questioned by practically every single person.

2 months pass since we moved in. The whole family is absolutely miserable and depressed. We hired attendants and my dad had to switch from his high paying job and one he had a position in, for a job that pays way less but one he could perform under his eye problem. 

We ended up getting used to it, and I wasn’t so sad anymore, until yesterday. I was playing a video game and battling against another player out of ego when my family’s attendant came in. She didn’t waste time getting to the point. “Your mother said to get the spare red blanket from the basement”.
“Alright, I’ll do it in a bit” I responded.

However, right as she was about to leave to go to her house, she quickly turned around and told me something odd.
“Oh, I almost forgot. Your mother told me rules you must follow. You must only get the blanket from the basement during the day, in fact, anything you wish upon doing relating or in the basement must be in the day. Don’t go to the basement at night.” 

I told the attendant thank you and farewell as I am in a state of confusion from my mother’s words, but I didn’t let my mothers message dwell to much as I was playing my game. A couple hours after I finish battling players and boosting up my virtual pride, I go to the basement. At this time it was 11:35 pm, obviously night time, but I forgot my mother’s words from playing my video game.

As I head down the steps to the basement, a shiver runs down my spine. I was nervous and scared to see the basement for some reason, since I never previously visited  the basement. It looked like every other basement. As I reached down to grab the blanket, the lights go off. I immediately get goosebumps, not only am I scared of the dark, I don’t know where the light switch is at.

I finally find it, and I turn it on, but only a feint glint flickers from the basements ceiling. I grab my phone and turn the flashlight on, and stand on nearby boxes to reach the “lightbulb”. I touch the light source, but it didn’t feel like an lightbulb at all. I touch the surrounding matter around it, and it felt like rough fur. My heart explodes and my eyes widened as I come to a realization, I’m not touching a lightbulb, I’m touching an eye. 

The demon could probably tell I realized that I knew he was a demon, so he let out a silent but hearable chuckle and he grabbed hand with a tight grip. He breaks my fingers and twists my hand before throwing me like the Amazing Hulk. I throw an empty can of soda around him before I hide in one of the boxes. 

I am in a corner box terrified. My heart was louder than a drum, my breath was louder than a wolf howling, and I was shaking so hard a bystander could probably infer it was a signal for someone to catch me. He wastes no time playing with his victims, he lifted the box and smashes my head against the concrete wall. I hit my head so hard, I see cows chasing stars. I grab nearby tweezers and stab him with it which did absolutely nothing, and immediately ran to my room terrified. 

I go on my bed and hide  underneath my sheets, putting some of the blankets in my mouth in an attempt to silence my breathing and think about calming activities to slow down my heart rate. I hear footsteps. By the third step he’s somehow in my room. He comfortably tucks me in as he reaches for my eyes. I try to put my hand over my face to shield my eyes but he swats my hand  down in half a second and uses his long nails to pull my eyelids down.

He growled before saying “I like your eyes they’re pretty. Tell you what, I’ll let you keep them if you can do a challenge. Don’t open them ever, and you can keep them! It starts now”. He said in such an enthusiastic voice that it convinced a part of my brain we were just playing a twisted game.

The lights turn on. I look at the lightbulb and then back where the demon was standing, but he wasn’t there. I immediately realized, I open my eyes. I already lost. Me typing all this will be the last thing I’ll ever see.

No one knows why my  family and eventually me went blind in 5 days without a reason except them, me, the demon, and YOU.
