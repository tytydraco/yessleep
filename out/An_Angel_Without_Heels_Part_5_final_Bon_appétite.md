Hello. I hope you’re doing well.

If you’ve followed my story up to this point—which I’ve tried to recount as I remember it, and perhaps in a somewhat restrained way—you’ll see that I’m going to set the drama aside and try to be more relaxed, without straying from the truth. We’ve reached the present day.

The ointment is still working to soothe my symptoms, even if only as a palliative. My skin falls apart, the larvae arrive, it regenerates little by little, and the cycle repeats itself. I must admit it’s almost laughable to think that this curse—if that’s what it is—isn’t held at bay by talismans, amulets, or rituals, but by a plain, ordinary ointment. Made from the very same infection, yes: the raw material that dear Gabriel mentioned. I haven’t seen him again; I suppose he’s… free?

The pain is more manageable now, but even so, nothing can make up for the disgust and discomfort I cause myself. Dark clothes, long-sleeved shirts buttoned all the way up, sweaters that make me look ready for Mass or some kind of religious service, scarves and other accessories—they cover what must not be seen and give me the appearance of a traditional, well-behaved boy. Luckily, I’ve managed to contain the infection, and it hasn’t spread beyond my knees, my fingers, and my head; I suppose that’s to be expected at this stage. I can pass for a healthy person.

But… how is it possible that while I suffer, the world goes on as if nothing were wrong?  
Sorry—I promised zero drama, haha.

I’m still working at the dessert shop; I’ve even learned a few recipes. My progress has been good enough that I now help prepare the frostings on some cakes, including those for our favorite customer. A week ago, he placed an order for today: a cake for his wife’s birthday, an occasion when their whole family will gather. What a happy event!

I made the frosting myself. I piped the red letters that read *Happy Birthday, Martha!*, surrounded by flowers in the same color over a white background—a very typical cake for a lady. The bitterness of the frosting, the flavorings…

When the customer came to pick up his order, I was delayed for a minute in the refrigerator, because I had to remove a small larva that was peeking out from the frosting. I need to be more careful. With a friendly smile, I handed the order to our favorite customer.

“Thank you for choosing us! Please give my regards to your wife.”

Once he left and I was alone in the shop, I felt the urge to take off my shirt, stretch, feel free—and dance. Why not?

I moved slowly, recalling the steps of a dance I learned in my art class back in high school. I try to coordinate myself as best I can; despite the pain from the friction, the yearning for freedom takes over. I feel as if I have a pair of wings urging me to take flight. I touch my chest and a strip of skin comes loose. That doesn’t stop me—I take it playfully and place it under my nose like a mustache, full of larvae, but functional.

I have to take advantage of this moment, while I can still keep my feet on the ground.

And you, dear reader—who has surely already tasted some of my creations without realizing it…  
did you enjoy them?

Bon appétite!.
