The summer had been longer than it should have, a heavy, clinging heat that made the air itself seem to sweat. Jay, thirty years old and still living not far from where he was born, found himself walking the back paths of his home parish after dark because the main road had flooded again.

The mix of oak, pine, and a few cypress trees leaned overhead like crooked old men, their beards of moss trembling with each ripple of the night breeze. 

His flashlight beam jittered on the mud, cutting a thin slice of the dark. The frogs were louder than usual, their calls layered and urgent, and beneath them he thought he heard something…*deeper*. A wetter clicking, something foreign and unsettling.

He told himself it was nothing. He’d been hearing things all his life in the bayous. Snapping branches, strange lights, silhouettes that shouldn’t be there. The trick was not to look too close and to keep moving like you don’t hear anything.

Jay had always felt bound here, tied to this soil like the rows of sugarcane that drank deep from the land. He’d left once, gone north for a year to Baton Rouge, but the city felt starved of something he couldn’t name. He came back and told himself it was for his mother, but she’d died two winters later. 

Still he stayed, renting the same old house off the parish road where the walls sometimes seemed to sweat out of its paint at night.

As he walked, he passed the clearing. Folks said it used to be a churchyard before the river shifted course, but now it was just a low patch of grass where nothing seemed to grow right. He saw them there, figures bent low, moving in rhythm. At first he thought they were cattle, but no, too many limbs, too pale against the dark grass. He clicked his light toward them, and the beam only caught mist. 

A trick of the shadows, he told himself. 

He kept moving, faster now. The air seemed to pulse with the croaking of the frogs, louder now like some strange concert. Their throats swelled huge, as if the swamp itself was straining to sing. A smell of sour milk rose, filling his nose and clinging to his tongue.

When he reached the old bridge, he stopped. Someone had chalked symbols across the wooden planks. Crude loops and branching lines and circles that bled into one another decorated the old bridge. They weren’t letters, but they pressed on his eyes like some language remembered from a dream. He stepped over them without meaning to, legs moving of their own accord. The frogs went silent the moment his foot touched the far side.

There was a tree just beyond the bridge, older than the parish, folks said. Its trunk split into too many roots writhing out in all directions. And at its base, something gleamed pale in the dirt. He crouched, hand reaching before his mind could argue. It was a kind of fruit, wet and soft-skinned, the color of curdled cream. When he touched it, it gave a shudder, and he swore he felt it pulse back against his palm.

The frogs began again, louder now, as if rejoicing. He dropped the thing and staggered back, and in the corner of his eye the tree’s roots seemed to twist, to arch upward like limbs raised in supplication. He heard the wet sound again, that low, sickly clicking, and for a heartbeat he thought he saw something vast and many-limbed moving just beyond the treeline, its edges blurring into the night.

Jay ran then, stumbling back toward town. He couldn’t remember the path, only the chorus of frogs that swelled and guided him, croaking as one voice, until the houses’ lights appeared like candles in a dark room.

Later, lying awake in his sweating house, he thought he could still taste that sour milk in the back of his throat. Outside the frogs sang on, endless and unbroken, their call blending to sound like bleating.

Like goats.
