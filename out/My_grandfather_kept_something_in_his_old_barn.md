When I was young, I often spent the summer at my grandparents’ farm, like I’m sure many other kids do. And as far as I can recall, the barn was always in the exact same shape. The large, red wooden building with the melting paint stood steadily near the treeline.  And the bull was also there.

 

One of the first (and only) rules my grandpa had me memorize was ‘Never go near the barn!’. He said that Frederick, the bull was living in there, and he is really mean, so I should avoid that place. And sure enough, I often heard the bull stomping around and huffing in the building.  

 

I remember, when I was around six or seven, I started gaining courage, and after my grandfather still refusing to show me Frederick, I wanted to see him for myself, so I crept closer to the barn. There was a relatively large hole in one of the planks, and my goal was to peek through it. However, before I could get close enough, something moved in the shadows on the inside, and I became the one being observed. A large, yellow eye appeared, its pupil constricting in the sunlight, and then something heavy hit the planks. Then again. A loud hissing followed, and I ran back to the house, crying. I wasn’t a particularly brave child.

 

It was around two or three years later, when my grandpa got a new bull. It was vey young, and had to be handfed, because its mother refused it. I think my grandfather’s original plan was to raise it up, breed it with his cows, and then send it to a slaughterhouse, but because of being raised by humans, this bull became such a sweet and playful animal, that no one would have had the heart to kill him. It was a surreal sight when I ran out from the house, and this gigantic, black bull with huge horns was speeding towards me, bouncing like a playful puppy. Despite his size, Otis was very gentle, and never harmed me when we played, despite the fact that one flick of his horns could’ve costed me my eye, or much more. (And yes, I got to name him. I was ten years old, so you don’t need to judge me).

 

Life was great for a time. I spent one moth of the summer at my grandparents’ farm, exploring the large house, and all the old trophies that remained from the hunting days of my grandpa. My grandmother baked cookies, and read me bedtime stories, and during the day, I could always go outside to play with Otis. I completely forgot about the old bull in the barn, but he was still there, stomping around, huffing, and sometimes charging the walls of his prison. I noticed that neither Otis or the cows liked going near the barn, and when I asked, my grandfather told me that old Frederick wasn’t the best behaved even with his own kind. I left it at that, and didn’t really investigate any further. I mean, I knew what a good bull was like now, so why would I care about the old one with anger issues?

 

As I grew older, my visits to the farm got shorter, at first reducing to one week of the summer from two or three, then only weekends. I still loved my grandparents, and the calmness of the countryside, but I staret growing up. I wanted to hang out with my friends, and eventually, girls, and my elders didn’t really have a place in this fast phased new life.

I was around sixteen when my grandmother died. She has been fighting cancer for months, before it won over the old body. It was a foggy autumn day when we attended the funeral. Sadly, things only went downhill from there for my grandfather. He loved grandma to death, and after sixty years of marriage, everyone silently assumed that he would soon follow her. But somehow, he managed to beat the odds. Although, it didn’t do him any favour.

 

He was now alone In the large house, only the plastic eyes of the stuffed animals following him. After my grandmother’s death, my grandfather started selling her stuff, and eventually more and more things. He got rid of many of his trophies, and eventually, he even let go of his cows, as he started feeling his age, becoming weaker by the day. At last, only Otis, and the old bull remained. Everyone understood why he didn’t sell Otis, since all the family loved him, his refusal to get rid of Frederick was unexplainable. That bull was a visibly a burden to him, and yet he didn’t even let anyone else take care of it.

\-He tolerates me, but I don’t want any of you to end up on his horns! -this was his response to all the offers to take care of Frederick.

 

Some years passed, and after being alone for so long, my grandfather’s health suddenly started going downhill really fast, which made everyone shut up about the bull. Most of the family forgot about it, and since the barn became quiet, everyone assumed my grandfather forgot to feed him, and he starved to death, but since grandpa still refused to let anyone near the him, we just left it as it is.

 

This went on for some time, until one day my phone rang while I was preparing to an exam at the uni. It was my father.

\-Hi! Do you have time to speak now?

\-Yeah.

Some small talk followed, before eventually he got to the subject.

\-So, how much free time ya got?

\-Well, my afternoons are usually free. Why do you ask?

\-You know, grandpa got a bit worse in the last few weeks, and I was thinking, could you go visit him sometimes, and help out at the farm? You know, you are the closest to him, so it wouldn’t be as long as a travel for you.

 

I almost said no. At the time I had enough of my father never wanting to take responsibility. He always asked someone else to do tings for him. They were usually small things, like asking mom to tank the car, or sending me or my sister to walk the dog, but eventually he started to ask bigger favours, like taking mom home from the hospital after a minor surgery, and it was becoming too much for me. But then I remembered the summers of my childhood. The memories came flooding in. Grandpa lifting me up to pet a cow through the fence. Us going to the near creek in the forest to fish. Me, running around in the yard, Otis playfully charging after me, while he watched us from the porch, smiling. This was not the moment to teach dad a lesson by protesting. He probably wouldn’t have understood it anyway.

 

\-Of course, I’ll do it.

\-Thank you so much! Call if anything happens!

\-Okay, bye!

 

And so, the next day, after my lectures ended, I went to visit my grandfather. The farm stood pretty far away from everything, so it was already late in the afternoon, when my old motorcycle’s tires tore into the dirt of the muddy driveway. As I got off the Honda, I heard the sound of galloping hooves and happy moos, as Otis ran out from his shed to greet me.

\-Hi big boy! I missed you too! Who let you out? -I asked, as I scratched his head.

Otis wasn’t in a talkative mode, so I didn’t get my answer, but he happily followed me to the house before he retreated to his shed.

 

The first thing I noticed after stepping inside was the smell. The house smelled old and ill. And also, the hall was dark. Usually the whole house was bright, but as I looked around, I noticed that all the curtains were drawn. After letting some light in, I walked upstairs. I noticed that even though grandpa sold most of his trophies, the house was still filled with the remaining ‘few’. A stuffed black bear standing on its hind legs in the hall, which was the first thing to greet whoever entered the house. A lion trophy in the living room. A buffalo, a moose, and some sort of gazelle hanging above the stairs. A jaguar skin rug upstairs. When I was young, these things filled me with awe, but as I grew older, I found them more and more disgusting. And even now, as I walked towards the bedroom, they were still a sad sight, and as the light danced on the glass eyes, it started to fill me with unease. It was like as the dead animals long gone eyes were following me. I finally reached the bedroom. Fortunately, there weren’t trophies here, apart from some sort of alligator or crocodile skin nailed on the wall, but at least it didn’t have eyes. 

 

My grandpa was hidden under a bunch of heavy blankets. He seemed so small, alone in the large oakwood bed, which he shared with grandma, until she was no more. But also, he seemed old. It has been a while since I saw him and time wasn’t easy on him in the meantime. His skin was hanging on him like only the skeleton remained underneath, and as he opened his eyes to look at me, I thought that they started to look like the glass ones of his long dead animals, as if his soul was halfway out from his body.

\-Josh? Is that you?

\-Hi gramps.

\-Come closer, I haven’t seen you in ages! How’s the university?

\-It’s going well. How are you? Do you need help with anything?

 

Although he clearly wasn’t in a good shape, at first, grandpa still refused any help, but after a while and some chatting, he asked for some soup. I was never a good cook, but I tried my best. When I returned to his room with the steaming bowl in my hands, I saw hi fell asleep. I left the bowl on the nightstand, and went on to do some chores around the house, and then cleaned Otis’ shed, and gave him some fresh hay. After that, I went back to the house, but grandpa was still asleep, and it was getting late, so I hopped back on my motor and left.

 

After the first visit, I set a routine of visiting every third day. These visits usually went pretty similar to the first. Until, about two months later, something was off. As I rolled up to the driveway, Otis didn’t come to greet me. I hopped off the motor, and ran to the house. Otis was waiting in front of the door, shaking his head, and huffing. He turned towards me in a weirdly aggressive way, which I never seen before, but luckily, after recognising me, he went back to his usual friendly self. As soon as I got past the bull, I teared the door open and ran upstairs.

 

Grandpa was in his usual spot, but he was sitting up in the bed, laying his back on a pillow. I didn’t think it was possible for him to get any worse, but now I saw that I was wrong. If he looked like a zombie before, now he was a skeleton. His head turned towards me as I entered the room.

\-Josh? You came again. No one else cared about me, but you did. Come here son, keep me company.

Have you ever saw a leaf at fall, just before detaching from the branch, and descending to the ground? It comes with a feeling of inevitability. You won’t be able to make that leaf stay on the tree. That was how it felt, looking into his whitening eyes, holding his dry, shrunken hands, and listening to him telling me things about his life. How he met grandma, who was as beautiful as the sunset over the sea. How they bought their first home, and raised their children. His hunting trips. The farm. The cows and the bulls he raised over the years. How they grew old together with grandma, and how he cried over her deathbed when cancer took her. How happy he felt when I was born. And then, after some time, silence. The leaf fell from the tree.

 

I can’t really recall what happened after this exactly, but somehow, I managed to call the hospital, my parents, and write to my friends at the university that I’ll probably won’t go at all next week. The following morning, I was sitting in the kitchen, eating a sandwich, while I didn’t really know what to do. The ambulance car took the body sometime at noon, but it was clear to everyone, that my grandfather isn’t going anywhere but the cemetery. My parents said they are coming as soon as possible. I was left to organize the remaining belongings. I spent the nearly the whole day tossing the trophies into a pile in the living room before I got to the bedroom. As I was trying to take the gator skin off of the wall, I noticed something on the nightstand. It was an old little leather-bound book. I don’t remember when grandpa got his diary, but he had it with him most of the time. When I asked about it, he often said that he has his hunting stories written in it, and he’s trying to make a book out of them. When I got older, he said he was collecting memories. I sat on the bed, and opened the diary.

 

At first, it really was mostly hunting stories. They honestly became kinda boring after like the third one, so I jumped ahead. The second half of the diary was much messier. There were just little memories, like grandma’s smile one morning, and also stuff like to do lists. As I was reading, a picture fell out from the book. I picked it up from the floor. On the pic, I saw grandpa, much younger, standing over some scaly thing with a gun in his hand. Probably the croc on the wall, I thought. I tried to find where the picture fell out from, and as I was looking, I found another thing tucked between the pages. It was an old newspaper page. “A new dinosaur, named Carnotaurus was found in Argentina with a nearly complete fossil.” -read the lead article. I smirked. Like nearly all young boys, I was fascinated with dinos when I was small, and knowing this, grandpa often bought me little plastic toys, and stuff like that. He probably wanted to show this to me as well, but then forgot about it. I spent some more time reading the diary, until I heard a loud moo from outside, which made me realise I completely forgot about Otis the whole day.

 

As I rolled in the last bale of hay into his shed, a sound caught my ear. It was coming from the barn. I thought it was probably just the wind or a rat, but I got curious. What things are left there? And what happened with the old bull? After it died, did anyone care enough to remove the body?

 

As I got closer to the barn, I realised I didn’t have the key for the door, and neither did I know where it was, so my only option was the gate. It was simple, opened by lifting a plank, and it led directly to the open part, where the bull lived. I turned on my phones flashlight to see better in the dusk, and then made one of the biggest mistakes of my life.

 

The gate was extremely heavy, but I figured it needed to keep in an animal weighting around a to, so it was kinda logical. As I pushed it open, the first thing that hit me was the smell of rotting flesh.

\-Great. So, nobody took care of that poor animal. -I thought.

And then my light eliminated something in the corner. A large, scaly body started moving, while two yellow eyes stared at me. The creature stood up, and I realised its size. It was big. Nearly twice as tall as me. It started sniffing the air, and let out a loud hiss. That was the moment I turned, and started running towards the house.

 

After moments, I heard heavy footsteps behind me, approaching quickly. Way too quickly. I started zigzagging. And then, I slipped on the wet grass, nearly reaching the house. I got up, and started running at the same time. The beast bit the air behind me. I started gaining speed, but I knew it won’t be enough. I felt its warm breath on my head, and I heard the sound of the jaws opening again, and then, a loud slam, and surprised hissing. i probably did the stupidest thing by turning, but apparently, it was my lucky day. Well, kind of.

 

Otis and the beast were circling each other in the yard. The moon spread light on the two animals, and I was able to take a better look at the beast. It was taller than Otis, but its body wasn’t really bulky, the muscular hind legs gave the creature most of its height. Its face was short, and two small horns were poking out of its head over the eyes. At first, I thought it had no forelimbs at all, but then I noticed the two sausage looking things next to its body. To be fair, it would’ve looked really stupid if it was a bit smaller. Some of its scales were bigger on its side, forming little bumps on the skin. The creature’s tail was around as long as the body.

 

As I watched them, I noticed, that the beast seemed familiar somehow. Suddenly, it came to my mind. The newspaper article in grandpa’s diary about the fossil. Carnotaurus. But what the hell was it doing here, looking way too alive? I couldn’t really think more as the Carnotaurus found an opening. It struck forward, but fortunately, Otis was prepared. He was in full fight mode, I never seen him like that before. As the dinosaur charged in, he turned, and headbutted it. Blood started raining from the Carnotaurus’ nose. It groaned in pain, and took a step back. Otis saw the opportunity, and as the predator retreated, he rammed into it, his horns tearing into the chest of the beast. The Carnotaurus screeched as the bull turned to face it again. Then after a short pause, it took a step back. Then, another. And then, with its next step, it lost its balance for a moment. It didn’t take more than that for Otis to come charging at the Carnotaurus. And then, as I startec cheering, and Otis victoriously lifted his head for the killing bow, the dinosaur stepped sideways. As the bull ran beside it, trying to turn, the Carnotaurus slammed its head into Otis. Then, as the momentum and the push made Otis fell to the ground, the beast stepped over him, and ripped his neck with a massive bite. With Otis’s last screams in my ear, I finally snapped out of my frozen state, and ran into the house as the Carnotaurus took the first bite from its kill.

 

After I got into the house, I raced to the living room, and frenetically started searching the drawers. I knew there have to be some left of grandpa’s hunting ammunition. At last, I found it. His old rifle was hanging above the fireplace, and my hands were shaking as I lifted it from the wall, and loaded the bullets in. The gun felt cold and heavy in my hand as I opened the front door and aimed it at the dinosaur still feasting on our beloved bull’s body.

 

You know, when you’ve never fired a gun in your life most of the time, you’ll miss. Well, I also missed, but since my target was so large, I still hit it. The only problem was that instead of killing, or even really harming it, the bullet only made the Carnotaurus way more annoyed. It growled as the bullet bounced off one of the large scales on its back, then turned towards where the gunfire came from.

 

I slammed the door as it started racing towards me, then tried to think of something. Moments later, the door flung open after a heavy thud, and the dinosaur lowered its head, as it tried to get into the house. To my fortune, the door was way too small for it to fit through, so I won more precious moments, while the Carnotaurus tried to figure out a way to get to me. The jaws snapped centimeters from me, and blood and salvia rained on my jacket as I ran to the kitchen.

 

I tried to push the old window open, but after three failed attempts, I simply threw a pan through it, then I climbed out, and ran to my motorcycle, which was parked on the driveway. Relief filled me as the engine came to life, but moments later, I heard heavy footsteps approaching. There was no time to think. I couldn’t turn around, as the Carnotaurus was coming from my left side. I simply started racing towards the forest.

 

For some time, I thought that I escaped. The sound of the footsteps faded in the roaring of the engine. There’s no way an animal this size can keep up with me. I turned as I reached the forest so I could keep staying in parallel with the treeline, and wouldn’t end up running into a tree. Then, just for good measure, I looked into the mirror.

 

The Carnotaurus was only a few meters behind me. Its jaws were slightly open, as its massive hind legs carried the agile body at such a speed that shouldn’t have been possible. The beast was now silent, only focusing on its prey. I tried to gain speed, but the mud and grass slowed me down too much. I soon heard the footsteps and the panting of the dinosaur clearly behind me, getting closer and closer. And then, the bike shook under me, and I flew into the woods. The last thing I hear was a victorious growl.

 

I don’t know what happened after this. I hit my head on a branch, and only woke up an hour later, deep in the night. My bike was thorn into shreds. This is probably what saved me. The only explanation I got is that I flew so quick into the woods that somehow the Carnotaurus didn’t notice it in the dark, and assumed it got everything. Now I’m back in the house. The body of Otis is mostly gone. It was like this when I got back. I didn’t see any sign of the dinosaur since, but sometimes, deep rumbling calls are echoing from the depths of the forest. Calls, which I now realised were part of my childhood. Only back then, they were coming from the barn at late night, while I was shivering under my blankets.

 

I don’t know how I’ll be able to convince anyone this is real. I checked the barn. Nothing, apart from huge chunks of rotting meat on the floor. Grandpa’s diary? Not a single mention, apart from that article, and maybe the photo. I can’t call the police or any other organization I know of. There aren’t any visible tracks left after the battle, and then my bike’s wheels tearing up the mud. I guess I’ll have to go and hunt down a dinosaur now.
