I wandered through each chartered street. The usual buzz of the city was muffled by a sonorous silence which left my ears ringing. No cars, no street lights, no houses awake. The city slept like it was hibernating - and in some ways it was. No technology meant the residents of \[unnamed\] City were dead to the world. There was the expected panic for the first few hours; but then a strange hush stifled the city. Quietude was anticipated, it was true, yet it was too quiet for comfort. This curious revelation shook me to his core - yet I was uncertain why. I mean, it made sense. Why wouldn’t everyone be silent when the power was cut off? But I was unsatisfied with this explanation. 



The next house I saw was a lanky house built from brawny bricks, which were supported by chocolate-covered oak beams. Not even candle light could be seen from the outside - did they even have a candle lit? Curiosity gnawed at me until it chewed its way through. Reluctantly - yet intrigued - I walked towards the window. All that was visible was nothing. There were no figures, no source of light, no discernible shapes. Just an inky abyss which began eddying its way out of the house. Without another word, I turned and left just as quickly as I arrived. Now, my mind was left disturbed, and I hastily found my watch to see the time. Only 7pm! Although dawn was approaching, as a promise of starlight, it wasn’t late enough to go to bed. Yet, it wasn’t dark enough for utter blackness. Perhaps they had black curtains - but no. That house was distinctive for their ochre curtains, which clashed with the brick-red colour of the house. It was as equally disturbing as it was fascinating.



After passing a few more houses, dawn began to trace the day, painting charcoal on a red-yellow canvas. But, in the distance - still perceivable - a raven silhouette. It was motionless, but it was definitely there. Two thoughts crossed my mind simultaneously; one, I should turn around and go back; or two, I should investigate. The latter was dangerous, yet enthralling in a morbid way. Immobile, the figure stood, menacing and bewitching. I knew I should turn back - I wasn’t an idiot. But there was something about the figure that tempted me. Like a chicken tempts a fox. There was an acknowledgement of danger, but no real threat has been posed yet. With an eager reluctance I pursued. 



The figure grew larger and larger, yet it was still unmoving. It was like a movie put on pause, it remained static. And although my heart was leaping, there was a strange placidity that urged me forward. I was certain as I approached it was a human, and possibly a man. Broad shoulders, no visible hair, and a tall frame. Incredibly tall in fact, he overshadowed me by at least 2 feet. Unnerving, yes. But impossible? Definitely not. This conclusion ultimately compelled me forward. Now, he was only 10 feet away. Despite the silvery moon irradiating everything around me; the man remained black and unintelligible. It was like a cardboard cutout, which was irrational.



I was at an arm's length when an astute realisation came crashing down. What was I going to do when I reached him? If it was a man, I’d be in danger. But if it was something else - something unfeasible - what then? Unfortunately, it was much too little, much too late. The man was revealed. It wasn’t a man, it was like some damned creature. A silvery effulgent body which looked moist yet dry. Large holes for eyes, no pupils, no iris. Hollowed cheeks which were accompanied by pudgy lips. Inside these lips, keen teeth coated by an incarnadine red. Long limbs which contorted implausibly. A crisp croak left its mouth. My senses were thrown into disarray. A deadly pang poisoned my veins. Then, nothing. It was gone. I threw my head around, left, right. Nothing. Without another word I turned on my heel and left for home.



So, here I am now, writing this post. The deadliest terror sits beside me, and I’m terrified of its return. I still hear its dry rasp behind me, but when I turn around there’s nothing. My laptop is the last thing I have charged and it’s nearly dead. Once it dies I’ll be plunged into darkness, where I am sure it will find me. The darkness is creeping closer.
