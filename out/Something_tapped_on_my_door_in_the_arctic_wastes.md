Hello, my name’s Cole. That’s not my real name and it’s probably a pretty bad idea to post this, but I’m sending it to a friend of mine so he can post it on his account. All that might ease my trail a bit. They’re talking about shipping me out on another assignment, so if I disappear, I want someone to be able to confirm this is real, say my real name, and tell the name of the company I work, or worked, for.

I’m from Canada, Ontario to be a bit more specific. You all don’t need my life’s story, and giving it would be a bit more identifying than need be. I’ll say this: I’m in my late 20s, I used to be a roughneck on an oil rig, and I caused a major accident. I won’t go into detail, but I’ll just say my mistake caused a top drive to snap, and I was very lucky I only caused the near million dollars of damage I did, instead of getting someone killed. After some tense negotiations, and the concerning excitement someone in upper management showed when they found out I didn’t have a wife and kids, I was given a choice: face prosecution and black listing from work, or take a special job for a couple years to pay off my debt. I chose the latter.

I signed some Bible thick stacks of paperwork and eventually I was set in a van, then a truck, and finally a boat on my way to a remote island in Nunavut. When I got to the dock a tall man with a strong Newfoundland accent greeted me. He flew his arm out to shake mine tensely and quickly. I turned around to see the man who’d driven me through the arctic sea quickly turning his boat around and sailing away. I heard my new friend chuckle in a slow dark manner behind me.

Right some cold, eh b’y?”

What is this place?”

Hell if I know.”

He turned around there on the spot and I followed him into the station, setting my bag down at the entrance. I was pretty surprised when I walked in. I was expecting something a lot more advanced or unique. But it just looked like they’d cut out a room from the oil rig, and set it right here in the arctic circle. There was machinery in the middle that looked like some sort of small scale drill or pump. Not really sure. Again, basic. Although, as my eyes were adjusting to the dim light of the room, I could swear the hole the machine was drilling into was giving off some odd rich glow. My friend didn’t seem to care about my interest in my new surroundings. He just jumped right into showing me how to work. I tried to engage him with pleasantries:

“Where are you from?” | “How’d you end up here?” | “How long have you been here?” )

Every time he’d ignore me and go back to showing me my daily tasks. Finally, while he was explaining some manual labor, I asked him one more question.

Yeah listen b’y. Very simple like. Just take this here cart, replace these purple filters in this machine here, and then write the number on this gauge in that terminal. Simple, eh?”

He was referring to an odd machine whose shape might be compared to a circulatory system: One large block in the middle with a few dials with lots of gauges, a slot for the filters he was talking about, and then at least a hundred thin tubes attached to it. He swatted a few of them to show me they weren’t fragile. I would also like to note that I am *heavily* tuning down his accent so it’s readable

Yeah no problem. So-”

“And like I was showing ya, you can move these wires or tubes or whatever they is, but don’t haul off and rip em. The scientist fella won’t be happy. Got it?

“Yeah, yeah. Don’t worry about it. So, listen, what’s your name?”

He paused, every other question just got a quick smirk and then silence, but he actually replied after a tense wait.

“Ya can call me Doyle"

“Is that your real name?”	“No.”

I didn’t ask him much for the rest of the evening. It was starting to get dark, and then a tall man, who looked like he hadn’t seen sunlight, a meal, or any sleep for months scurried into a room Doyle was explaining to me

“Oh, hello.”

“Who are you?!”

He was clearly paranoid.

“Calm down b’y. He’s a new roughneck, though I ‘spose the titles not official.”

My second coworker was still looking me up and down and scanning my face, it was very disconcerting.

“Doyle, where did he come from?! Did you see him come off the dock? Do you remember seeing him come off the dock?”

“Yeah I did. Don’ worry so much. If it was anythin like that I’d have dealt with it. Besides, it’s never happen’d yet.”

I saw him slowly force himself to loosen up, and then he actually looked bashful.

“Sorry. This place gets to you after a while.”

Doyle cut in.

“Wouldn’t if you’d get some sun like I keep tellin ya. Eh b’y?”

The other man ignored him. He reached his arm out and we shook hands.

My name’s Lucas. I’m this base’s researcher. Sorry for being so discerning, but it’s better than being careless.”

My name’s Cole, and you’re all right. Worried about spies or something?”

Spies?!”

He started laughing in a loud and wild manner. I saw Doyle shuffle out of the room from the corner of my eye, he signaled a pack of cigarettes at us.

No no. Spies would be fun!. That would be a welcome change.”

I think Lucas caught himself and his odd behavior by the nervous look I was giving him.

Sorry, I didn’t mean to freak you out, I was ju- Sorry nevermind.”

He shuffled off and started writing down some numbers on some other machinery in that room. After a few minutes I decided to venture some questions on him.

May I ask what this place is? And what are we even doing here?”

Ah yes. I’m sure Doyle is giving you his regular silent treatment. He never quits doing that, you know. But-but he’s a good man don’t get me wrong. I think. I have no idea why they put him here really and every time I’ve tried to ask him about it he just smiles in that odd way he always does. Really I don’t-”

Lucas seemed to barely be attached to our conversation and was just enjoying that someone was here who he could actually talk to. He went on rambling about life there at the base for 2 hours as I followed him, collecting his data in his notes across the base. In between filler conversation and STEM muttering, the kind of STEM talk that gives you the impression the person is trying to show off their knowledge, I learned a bit about him and about the base.

I asked him why he was there, he vaguely hinted that it was government work, and that if he makes some “advances” in his work he’ll be assigned a more comfortable post with lab assistants. I learned his mother was Canadian, but his father was Brazilian, and that if we are lucky with our ration requests that he’ll make us some Brazilian food like his father used to cook, of course we’ll also have to eat jiggs dinner with Doyle first. Finally, I pushed and asked about the whole operation again.

And do you see this gauge here? I want you to at least brush by it once a day. If it’s making these normal oscillations, then that’s fine. Now! If you ever see it start flashing red and beeping, that’s also fine and please let me know about it. However, if it ever goes flat, run to your dorm and let us know on the radio.”

Yeah for sure. I’ll keep an eye on it. But, listen, I really just want to know what we’re even doing here? Like, what’s going on?”

He gave me an odd side eye. 

You wouldn’t understand if I told you everything, and be grateful for that. I’ll just say a… *well* of… *something* was discovered here. A well of something that doesn’t make sense, but is **very** useful if extracted, *carefully.”*

He was very deliberate with his words.

Don’t ask any more questions about it, just be afraid of it. Okay? The last fellow you’re replacing made the mistake of being curious.”

What happened to him?”

I was expecting silence, as if Lucas had realized he shouldn’t have told me that. But he replied almost casually, save for the visible concern on his face.

He fell in. There was an issue with the seal at the pump. Doyle was asleep, and I warned him to wait until morning, but he didn’t listen. I swear, looking back and reflecting on the way he was talking those last few days, and how odd the “malfunction” was, I think he opened it deliberately. I rushed out of my dorm when I realized I should have been there to caution him, and I came into the room right as he fell in.”

Lucas had stopped completely and was giving the floor a 1000 yard stare. He got quieter. 

He was stiff as a board, and staring straight down into the depths. This… terrifying but beautiful glow was coming out of it, and he just leaned over and fell through.”

Lucas’ eyes darted across the various terminals and gauges in the room with us.

I managed to activate the subterranean seals, as he should have done in the first place to make repairs, but the numbers have been *very* different since then. Almost organic. I warned the company to halt operations for a few months, but they just ordered Doyle to fix the seal and they ordered me to run everything back up.”

He stared back at me, it made me uncomfortable.

Watch out for anything unusual okay? We have to keep this place running, I’m not sure what would happen now if we didn’t keep the pressure regulated, but just keep a watch out, for my job’s sake, but really for *all of us.”*

He was still staring through me with his dehydrated bug eyes, and then his face suddenly popped back into reality.

Oh! Has Doyle explained the living arrangements to you? I just realized you may not know what I meant by ‘dorms.’”

Un, no he didn’t.”

Well, come on then! I’ll show you, besides I’ve made my rounds and it’s getting late, it’s time to eat!”

I grabbed my bags and followed Lucas to the back of the building. I hope I didn’t make it sound like it was a very large building, compound, or outpost, I’m not really sure what to call it. I’ll just call it a base. The base itself consisted of only the main drilling room, a diagnostic room (data chamber as Lucas liked to call it), a supplies room, and the room with the main generator and fuses. I was able to follow Lucas around for so long, however, because each room had at least 5 different gauges he took long, scattered notes on. The data chamber itself had at least 30, I never counted them all.

At the back of the base I put my heavy coat back on and we went outside and across a thin bridge into a smaller building. When we stepped inside we found Doyle had already begun cooking dinner. They explained these were our dorms. We had a shared kitchen and living area, but we had separate bathrooms. I’d dealt with worse conditions. It was almost cozy really. Doyle made us some kind of spicy chicken soup with spaghetti noodles, our rations were being delivered in a few days so he had to get creative with what we had left. We ate and talked about life in the arctic wastes. 

After dinner we smoked cigarettes and played rummy together and I tried getting them to open up more, but I quickly realized even they didn’t have much information for me. Lucas headed out first, said he had to send his report in. Me and Doyle played a game of chess. He beat me badly, but he was a good sport about it. And I tried a couple more times to get some more info:

“What’s the creepiest thing you’ve seen out here?” | “Lucas seemed worried about the machines, are you?”)

Everytime he either grinned and didn’t reply or he just waved his hand. I started to get the feeling I was asking him to talk about things he was trying not to worry about, so I quit. He showed me around the dorms a little bit more; there was a closet with first aid supplies and we had some old movies and NES games, for killing free time. If I wanted books or anything like that I’d have to request it. He finished his tour at my room.

And this is where you’ll be sleepin, cozy eh?”

Yeah, thanks.”

The room was basic, but the bed was clean and the blankets were thick. It had an alarm clock on a small night stand, an oak armoire, and then I finally realized it had a solid metal door. It finally dawned on me to ask why the living arrangements were so strange.

Hey Doyle, why are the dorms separate from the building? And what’s with the metal doors?”

Ah I dunno, to protect against radiation or somethin. Don worry about it b’y.”

And then, as casually as you would hand someone a towel, he opened the armoire and handed me a shotgun.

Lucas requested ‘em, but the only way ya’d ever be hurtin for it is if a polar bear broke in.”

I was flabbergasted.

Uh, thanks.”

He left and the door made a satisfying, cold chunk. I remember it was hard to sleep that first night. So much had just happened; I had a whole new job, new coworkers, a new place to live, something unknown and dangerous being pumped out below me, and all the 50-something other odd specifics and circumstances. And then, there I was, in a cold sterile cell of a room with a shotgun, trying to make sense of it all. 

I did sleep that night, eventually, and I got better at getting over everything. Life at the base was straightforward and uncomplicated, for me anyways. It took some time to learn the new machinery and the syntax on the terminals, but after a couple weeks I got the hang of it. It was a lot like working on the rigs, you forced yourself to get over the looming sense that if one thing goes wrong you’re dead or injured, and at least here the danger was a little interesting. 

I was there at the base for just two and a half months, and I was told it would take at least two years to pay off my debt. I’m not sure if recent events will lower or raise that time, but I suppose we’ll see. 

It all went down at the end of my short time there, but there were some instances of note before then I suppose. I began to have the same dream every night: floating across a thick purple ocean with sparks of blue light overhead illuminating odd twisted creatures floating around me. I tried to brush these dreams off, but then the little things around the base kept me on an ever sharpening edge. On smoke breaks with Doyle I noticed there was no wildlife around the base, but the ocean life was very active. Fish would wash up on shore constantly, and whales would constantly surface close to us. I asked Doyle about it once, but he just ignored me and kept smoking. 

Lucas was right about the data. Most of the time it was without note and the digital notes that accompanied them were rhythmic and bland, but suddenly the beeps would quicken and begin to sound like some low pitched wailing. Like a whale’s call or a dying cat. There was also Lucas, I liked him quite a bit, but if you didn’t stop him he’d start theorizing all these terrible things that were about to happen, or happening, with the “substance” below. And he’d always mutter something like “I’m not so sure we should have messed with something beyond our scientific understanding.”

Still, though I was somewhat disturbed, life was straightforward at the base, and I got close to Doyle and Lucas, or as close as I could to such an odd pair. Doyle was quiet, but I enjoyed our smoke breaks and the hopeless competition of trying to beat his record on an NES game called Ghosts and Goblins. Lucas was strange, but beneath his spastic intelligence I could see a kind man. Also, we did end up getting some slack from the ration requests and they sent Lucas the ingredients he needed to make pão de queijo, I think the only unique one was tapioca flour. It was really good.

I miss Lucas, and it disturbs me to think about him. I remember, just a couple days before it happened he said something very concerning to me.

You know, Cole, I really hope we get out of here soon enough. If I get assigned to a nicer lab, like I know I will, I’ll put in a request for you to have a job there with me. A body guard or something, or maybe you could have a nice job in one of those massive warehouses they have! We just gotta keep it up, keep a watch out. We won’t end up like the last crew.”

I was smiling about the prospect of working with Lucas in a fancy government lab, but his last words hit me. I’d been under the assumption we were the first crew this whole time, and not the successors to some tragedy.

There was a crew before us?”

Lucas just nodded at me with his bug eyes.

What happened to them?”

I wish I knew Cole. When I got here they just told me there was an “incident.” And when I, as nervous as you are now, asked what happened, they just told me not to be negligent and I wouldn’t have anything to worry about.”

He closed the distance between us and was uncomfortably close.

I’ll tell you this though, the whole base smelled like bleach and cleaner, like they had to scrub *every inch* of it down. If you look behind some of the machinery and below the keys on the keyboard, where they wouldn’t have cleaned, sometimes you find *dried blood.*”

He scurried off after saying that, and I got the impression he’d been wanting to say it for a while.

My dreams had intensified slowly. By this point, I had already assumed these dreams were of the well below us, and against my rational doubts I really began to assume they were caused by some unknown psychic force. The liquid I floated in and the creatures around me, slowly night by night, became restless. That sea of darkness was almost boiling with anticipation, and these maddening creatures around me were howling and contorting in such a gross fashion. I could swear I could hear their bones grinding against each other, and the noises that came from their mouths, if you can call such disturbing orifices mouths, will be with me for the rest of my life. I became aware of myself as well. I wasn’t some invisible spectator floating along, no I was one of them in my dream, but whatever form I was assuming was greater. The things around me feared me, and they were in such anticipation for what I was about to do. 

The final night, before it all, I remember in my dream, when the noises and chaos around me were long past unbearable, I looked up and saw a metal hatch. It had the company’s logo. I felt I was about to pass through it.

But I woke up. That day, something was wrong, and we could all feel it. I didn’t believe that Doyle’s face could show fear, but the wear lines had shown through and his eyes were squint and blood shot. We took more smoke breaks than actual work, and everytime, those whales and other marine life were all there, but they weren’t agitated. They just circled our island. Waiting. 

Lucas, he was quiet and his eyes were as wide as loonies. He was skittering around the whole base, hunched over and muttering. I was working on one of the filters when he suddenly ran up to me. He looked terrible.

COLE! Forget all that, do you remember that monitor I told you to keep checking? DO YOU?!”

Yeah, man I-”	“FORGET ALL THIS BUSY WORK. I need you to watch that monitor for the remainder of the evening. NOW!!!”	I put down the filter I was holding and rushed out, he yelled back to me, his voice cracking with fear.

IF THE MONITOR’S FLAT RUN, AND TELL US!!! *YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT COLE!!!* ***PLEASE!!!***”

I busted into the room, and there was the monitor. It was fluctuating wildly, wilder than it ever had before. I remember standing there in the doorway, staring at it. I only checked my watch a couple times, I was so tense. I was there for at least an hour. I kept hearing Lucas and Doyle shuffle past me, and alerts began to go off all around me. The room I was staring into became a terrifying kaleidoscope of flashing lights and pressurized tubes that were flying loose and wild. After a long agonizing wait, the monitor began to stutter loudly, finally, like the ekg of a heart attack victim, it had just a couple more heavy loud signals, and then it did nothing. The monitor went flat.

I reached for my radio just as it happened, but a loud metallic thud from the main drilling room reminded me to run. I was flying across the base when I radioed:

LUCAS, DOYLE, GET TO YOUR DORMS!!! THE MONITOR WENT FLAT!!!”

I think they responded, but just when I got done with my call I burst out the back door. I don’t even think I had my coat on. I just booked it across the bridge and into the dorms. I remember glancing to my right for just a moment, and there on the shore was a washed up whale. I stumbled through the kitchen and down the hall, and I pushed that iron door shut as fast as I possibly could.

I heard running past my door. 

COLE! Did you get into your room? I saw your door was closed.”

The radio screaming up at me like that, I swear it almost did me in. I was still catching my breath:	“Yeah -*HUFF-* I’m good.”

Doyle!?”

*HUFF HUFF-* Yea -*HUFF-* here.”

I realized Lucas was the only one who wasn’t out of breath. I guess running around the base everyday was good cardio.

The radio was still on but me and Doyle just sat there catching our breaths for the next five minutes. 

What the hell happened?”

Doyle answered back.

I was in there ya know? The drillin room. The damn thing blew out the floor. That purple whatever was leakin all o’er the stuff b’y.”

He sighed and his voice dropped.

I turned tail, but I’swer, looked back and there was an arm comin from below Lucas.”

God.”

We didn’t speak again for awhile, but finally I had to ask.

You alright Lucas? And what was all that?”

I’m alright Cole, I was last out, but I’m a good runner. I didn’t see whatever it was, but I heard it open the back door right as I got into the dorms.I don’t know what it was Cole, I wish I did. Maybe then I could advise us what to do now. But I don’t know.”

I remember Doyle and Lucas talked things over for a while. I just got lost in my memories of the dreams. I didn’t want to sleep another night in that room and I was terrified to think about what horrible dreams were waiting for me, if something didn’t manage to bust in here and kill me first. Had they drilled too deep? Drilled too long? Was this inevitable from the moment this reservoir of unknown power was tapped? I don’t know. These thoughts, they were ancillary. Really, I just didn’t want to die. Not there.  

Lucas said something that snapped me out of my stupor.

I’ve already sent an SOS to HQ. But we need to get back out there.”

What?”

I was afraid the seal would burst, but I didn’t ever think the APMS would get fried. It’s not a hard fix, but it needs to be done soon.”

What happens if we don’t? Can’t we leave it for a couple days while HQ gets back to us?”

Lucas explained, in simple terms, that once a reservoir of this substance was tapped it had to be heavily regulated, and normally an AMPS (automated pressure modulated system) took care of it. If it wasn’t repaired, within, at most, 12 hours we’d be blowing up with the base, not to mention exposed to that substance.

I’ll do it.”

Doyle said it with an emotionless cold tone, I guess it took him a bit, but he’d found his composure again.

Listen, Doyle, I’m the fastest runner-”

Replacement part’s heavy sn’t it? Listen b’y, I can keep cool better and all that. Just let me handle it.”

There was some arguing, and I was surprised Lucas seemed genuinely willing to let me and Doyle stay here while he repaired the system himself. I even offered, and I was serious, but Doyle was adamant, besides his door was closest to the entrance. We were going to wait a couple hours, and then Doyle was going to head out.

I wish we’d talked during those last two hours. I wish I’d have finally tried to get Doyle to tell more about himself, and maybe it was better he didn’t, but still. I wish I learned more about Lucas’ family. I wish I told them how much I’d come to enjoy their company, and though it was an odd job that wasn’t good for the mind, they made it enjoyable. But I didn't, we all three just sat there holding our breath. Waiting. Eight words were spoken in those two hours, I spoke the first six.

We’re going to be okay guys.”

Doyle had the last two.

We’ll see.”

Time ran out, and it was time for Doyle to get it over with. We asked him to keep his radio on the whole time, and he did. He put on his coat, grabbed his shotgun, and opened the door. I had a horrible feeling that as soon as he’d opened the door we’d hear some demonic howling and Doyle’s screams, but there was just the slow metallic grind of the opening door and Doyle’s cautious breath.

Okay, nothins here. From now on out, I don’t want yall to speak unless I call, eh?”

Got it.”

Of course.”

He passed through the rest of the dorms and we heard the sharp cold wind blowing through the microphone. 

Nother whale’s washed up.”

The snow on the bridge was crunching under his feet, and I was beginning to become so tense I could barely breathe. I’m sure I didn’t even blink the whole time. We heard the door open. He didn’t say anything, but his breath had quickened as soon as he entered the building. It must’ve looked awful. From there, it was, I counted, 13 minutes of slow footsteps, sometimes footsteps on something that sounded wet and thick. Finally, we heard careful work begin. Another six minutes later, and a satisfying chunk was heard through the radio followed by whirring. The AMPS was working again. Doyle put in a few inputs, and then we heard him turn around to leave. I was feeling hopeful at this point, if he’d gotten through all that, surely he could be lucky enough to get back to the dorms. 

An obnoxiously loud buzzer suddenly rang out and an auto voice followed it:

**AMPS SYSTEM RESTORED. PRESSURE DE ESCALATION AT 58%.”**

Whatever was there in the base with him, suddenly it busted something open and started howling. I don’t even know if howl is the right word, it would be better described as the conjoined moaning of a man and some alien marine creature beyond rationality. You could tell, even over the radio, it was getting closer and it was getting closer *fast.*

Doyle began to run. He was pushing it, and his boots hitting the floor sounded like claps of thunder over the radio, but that howl was close behind and getting closer. All the way out the building, scrambling across the bridge and crashing through the front door of the dorms, it was getting closer. He must’ve been in the kitchen, and I could barely hear it through my door. 

***AHHHHHHHH! NO!!! HELP M-”***

His radio was thrown through the air and the feed turned to static as it made impact. Lucas was crying out.

DOYLE!!! HOLD ON!!!”

LUCAS WAIT!!!”

Too late, he cut his feed, and I heard him run across the hall and past my door, cocking a shotgun. I was pressing my ear against the door frame, more so trying to push my ear through it, and I heard him get to the kitchen, scream, get a shot off and turn around to run back to his room. Caution had left me, and I turned around and grabbed my shotgun and I ran for the door. As I did, it got Lucas, whatever it was had caught up to him. 

I heard him screaming in a way I didn’t know men could scream, and there were so many wet, loud thuds against my door, even after he’d died. Whatever that thing was, it was still howling, and it was right outside my door.

After a while the sound of it ripping and smashing flesh apart had died down. I couldn’t hear anything at first, but I cautiously pressed my ear against the door once more. I heard shuttered slow breathing. I just backed away slowly and sat on my bed, shotgun towards the door.

Once again, I didn’t hear anything for a while, of course I was still tense, but I was hoping this was how it would be until HQ arrived, but then it started.

*tap tap tap\**

It was tapping on my door. This violent abomination which had just slaughtered my two friends was knocking on my door like a cat asking for food. I was shaking then, violently shaking.

*TAP TAP TAP\**

The walls seemed to be closing in around me and I realized too late I wasn’t breathing. I overcorrected and tried to catch my breath too much. My head started spinning and I dropped the shotgun on the bed with me. 

***TAP TAP TAP\****

Things were getting fuzzy around me and I was choking on air. I heard that monstrosity tapping away as I faded into darkness. It was a short dream after that. I saw myself with multiple twisted arms, dragging the corpses of my two friends back through the base, though by that point only a broken spine and some stubborn organs were left. There were so many whispers around me that I couldn’t hear before. Telling me of a new world. A planet of unending chaos and therefore equality. In this world there would be no gods and no devils. It would just take time. All these dark omens, I continued to hear as I lowered myself back down the seal, bodies in tow.

I awoke to the sound of my metal door opening, and I began screaming, but on the other side I saw men in hazmat suits pointing at me, one of them was even laughing, I faded back out of reality, though thankfully the nightmares were over. I didn’t dream after that. I awoke again, being flopped down into the back of a van, surprising the man who laid me there.

Oh hey, I thought you’d be out for a few more hours. Feeling any better?”

Where am I?”

We’re sending you back to HQ. Gotta tell you son, you better be grateful you weren’t awake to see all that mess in there. I mean there was every part of the body everywhere, know what I mean. In the same spot there was brain matter, a tooth, and- oh there you go hold on pal I got you.”

I passed back out again. I finally awoke, for good, back at the headquarters. The higher ups were still chattering over the “pipe failure,” and they barely noticed I was there. Someone had a little empathy for me and directed me towards some facilities where I could get myself together to some degree. I showered, changed, and ate, but I barely remembered it. I was still in shock I suppose. Maybe I still am.

I came back out to the same worried, but shockingly casual, discussion. One of them pointed to me, and even suggested I would be a good candidate for the next crew, but then the same man from before argued that I’d been through enough, and that I should be allowed the option, after that he kindly put his hand on my shoulder and told me that head on home and get some rest, that they’d contact me in the next couple of weeks. As I was walking out the door, one of them, one who looked barely interested left me with a note:

Don’t forget those NDAs boy, know would believe you, but you don’t want to get yourself into trouble, eh?”

I stormed out. And here I am. I didn’t renew my lease as I thought I’d be working at the base for a long time, so I’m staying with a friend. I filled him in on some details, but just enough to know what to do if I disappear. 

There’s no making sense of things. What can I gain from all of this? Fear, that’s all. I don’t know what to do now, and this is still a bad option, but I want to do something. If this is the last you all hear from me, then just watch out for “special jobs” from corporate overlords, and stay away from arctic research bases.
