It was a cold, quiet night, just me and my girlfriend Megan, cruising down the backroads. The stars were barely visible through the snow that gently blanketed the earth, and the hum of the car was the only sound filling the air. Everything felt peaceful… until my phone rang. It was an unknown number—no name, just the vague "Unknown Caller" label on the screen. I figured it was spam and ignored it.

A few minutes later, the phone rang again. Still "Unknown Caller." I didn’t pick up.

Megan gave me a sideways glance, laughing. “Persistent for Christmas night,” she said, half-joking. But then, the phone rang for the third time.

By this point, I was getting frustrated. Why couldn’t these telemarketers just leave us alone on Christmas Eve? I grabbed the phone, ready to tell off whoever it was. But when I answered… everything changed.

“Hello, Josh.”

I froze. The voice was strange—low, calm, but with a tinge of something unsettling. It was like they knew me. But how? They started listing off personal details—my full name, my address in Evanston, even the name of my high school. I looked over at Megan, trying to keep it together. This was way too weird.

Then came the moment that still chills me to my core.

“I’m not here for you, Josh. I’m here for Megan.”

My heart dropped. I glanced at her, trying to make sense of what was happening, but she looked just as freaked out as I felt.

I tried to brush it off, telling the caller they had the wrong number. But then came the soft, unsettling laugh, followed by, “She’s sitting next to you.”

At that moment, I slammed the brakes and pulled over. My hands were shaking so hard I could barely hold onto the phone. Before I could even speak, Megan, without a word, ended the call.

I turned to her, panic rising in my chest. “What the hell was that?” I shouted.

She didn’t answer right away. Her gaze was fixed on the dark road ahead. My heart was still racing.

I tried calling the number back, but the phone showed no signal. Again, I tried, but nothing.

Megan finally spoke, her voice barely above a whisper: “I didn’t know what else to do.”

From there, the car ride was silent. No music, no conversation. Just the eerie quiet stretching between us. When we reached her place, I sat in the driveway for a long time, trying to process everything that had just happened.

That was over a month ago. We’ve asked everyone—both families—no one knows who called us, or how they could’ve known we were on the road that night. And Megan? She insists she has no idea who it could’ve been. But sometimes I catch her acting strangely… distracted, quiet, like she’s hiding something.

I haven’t gotten another call since then. But I can’t shake the feeling that it’s coming. And when it does, I’m not sure what to expect.
