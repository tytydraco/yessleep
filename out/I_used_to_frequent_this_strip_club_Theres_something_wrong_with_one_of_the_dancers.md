I laid back and closed my eyes. *Yep, another weekend started right.* I opened them again when I heard the loudspeaker come on.

**"Now coming to the floor, you know her name and you see her face everywhere, awake and in your dreams..."**

I hear the clack of platform heels on the linoleum approaching the pole. I leaned closer, checking my watch. It was 8:30 P.M. It was *her* time. Three purple spotlights surrounded the pole; one directly overhead, and the other two on either side of it.

**"Scarlett Widow!"**

The entire room around me went into an uproar, briefly drowning out the music. The click of heels were right on top of us now, and the perfectly slender waist of Scarlet Widow came into view, bathed in radiant velvet LED. She looked out at the crowd, face chiseled in a cold, stoic sort of expression. You know the type; the dead in their concern, "fuck life and the horse it rode in on" look. The look that let each and every rock hard drool monkey in the room know that *she* was now in control, and that they better behave themselves, and that they'd be thinking of her *long* after she got off the pole. In a word, the "Bad-bitch" face.

The music kicked in, some techno-cyberpunk themed shit, and for the first ten seconds, she just stood there, gripping the top of the pole, still gazing forward with doll's eyes, before quickly going full vertical by throwing her gorgeous legs up and around the top of the pole. From there, she did this graceful sort of upside down ballerina twirl, sliding down the pole. The entire way down, time seemed to slow down, drawing out every second as she descended, piercing everyone with her cold stare.

Like everyone else there, when her eyes met mine, I came two seconds from losing my damn mind. Here's the thing about this place, *"The queen's lounge"* , down here in Charlotte; it may be the most expensive club in town, but you bet your bottom dollar it's worth every penny and more. The girls are the best I've ever seen around; perfect top to bottom ratio -- not too big on top or bottom, but just enough to be fun, you know what I mean? All of them could've been contenders for cover models for *Maxim* or *Cosmopolitan*, but NONE of them held a candle to the genetic paragon of fucking beauty like Scarlet was.

She had looks that would've made an old man get hard again, coupled with her powerful glare. Her movements were like if you made a seasoned ballerina get on the pole; graceful and sleek, fluid, and artistic in a way. Watching her under the lights was like watching paint bleed onto a canvass to just run freely. Every guy that ever went there on a Friday night would always try to tip extra at the bar, claiming it as a "Complimentary drink" to Scarlet. Most of the time it was to convince her to get them in on a private session in the back room, usually getting thrown out of the club before five minutes was even over because they couldn't keep their pants on and their hands off. It's always funny as hell, too, because they'd come running out of the back, white faced and wide eyed like they were being chased by a lunatic, talking about "I gotta get outta here, there's some fucked up shit in there, man! I'm finally free!"

Let me clarify something real quick. I said *every* guy did this shit, but I should've specified something, every guy did this shit *except* me. Now, obviously, you'd probably think, "But Eddie, why the hell haven't you taken your shot, man? What, you ain't got no game or somethin'?" Well, to start, I'll say don't you worry about "game", buddy. Trust me, I had game -- ask my wife, plus her three friends. And second, while me and her *are* in an open relationship, that doesn't mean I'm always gonna go and pork every nice piece I come across. I went to the *Queen's lounge* to have a little fun, sure, but more times than not, I was just there to look, fantasize, have a couple drinks and then go home and have my own fun with my old lady.

This Friday night was a different story, though. I wasn't sure why, but I'd decided that night that I was gonna take a shot with it, see if maybe I could be the first to actually get lucky with her and "tame the beast" so to speak. That I think about it, I'd probably just had a little more to drink than I should've when I had the idea; and so again, it was nothin' I was necessarily gonna lose sleep over if it went haywire. If nothing else, though, I'd probably get at least a funny story out of it. Well, wish *half* granted. I got a story out of it, but I'm not sure it's something I'd call "funny".

Anyway, so she puts on her little show for us before the lights and music die away and the next dancer is called to the stage. This was also the point where "Happy hour" was called, when all drink tabs were ignored and you could hit up the bar as much as you wanted for an hour, and where you left the payment for the aforementioned private sessions with any of the previous dancers. Another reason I had this idea, also, was the fact that I'd just recently gotten a raise at work, and this was the first check with that increase -- and a beefy fuckin' increase it was, too -- so naturally, I thought I'd have a night to splurge a bit.

After raiding the place dry of their stash of *Guiness*, I decided to take my shot, slamming two hundred dollar bills on the bar. Phil, the junkie dropout from high school-turned-bartender, raised his eyebrows at me. I raised my right one back at him.  his eyes glanced back and forth between me and the bills on the table, a small smirk splitting the right corner of his mouth. He knew what was going on, and he was probably thinking the exact same thing I was, *"Jesus Christ, the boy's actually about to take the plunge."*

"How long?" he asked. I shrugged, chuckling.

"Eh, till either I come out screaming "Sweet Jesus" or "Oh SHIT!" He and I both laughed at that.

"She ain't easy, brother, I'll tell you that much." I downed another swallow.

"Well yeah, what fun would it be if she were?" This provoked a blurted, donkey laugh from him while I finished my last swallow and slammed the glass face down on the bar, indicating I had enough in me to pull of this little stunt without any more liquid courage. He took up the glass and told me that he'd page Scarlet Widow and to wait at the bar before running off to the back.

I sat for about another twenty seconds before I heard the clacking of platform heels coming straight for me. I looked over to my right and there she was, standing tall and dominant, staring down at me. Now, despite what I'd just said about not needing any more to drink before pulling this little stunt off, I found myself almost wishing I could throw another shot or two back. Regardless, I stood up and she said, in a surprisingly lower pitched voice than what I was expecting, "Are you ready?"

Clearing my throat, I replied, "Um, yeah, shit, let's go." She held out her hand, locking her eyes onto mine, trapping me in her grip of cold dominance. I knew that as soon as the door to the champagne room closed, *she'd* be taking charge of the situation. *Well, I did say I wanted the challenge.* I said to myself while simultaneously praying to God I can still walk out from this without having my ass handed to me by her as we walked down the hall to the champagne room. "Right this way." she said, turning to the right in the dark.

At first I was confused. Either because of how dark the hallway was or because there was no sort of sign or doorknob to mark the doorway, I couldn't help but stand there, wondering what the hell she was talking about. Suddenly, though, I watched her push against the wall and from it came this violet glow that painted itself throughout half the hallway. She looked expectantly at me again before stepping into the room. I closed my eyes and drew a deep breath. *Come on man, you can do this...*

I slowly approached the light in the doorway. Before I was even able to reach the door itself, an intense wave of heat passed through me. It wasn't a sort of heat like you'd feel from the sun, per say, but maybe like what you'd feel coming from an oven, if that makes any sense. It was controlled, dry, artificial in a way, at least the way I felt it. It was strangely soothing, if not a bit ticklish.

"Come on, darling." said Scarlet. "It's much more comfortable from deeper inside." Looking inside the room from the doorway, I found her on her haunches like a lion about to pounce on me across a queen size mattress with the most beautiful, expensive looking, and most comfortable looking red silk sheets and quilt I'd ever seen. I was mesmerized by the room, unable to even fully take in everything I was seeing, despite it overall being an average sized room.

She raised up on the bed, her eyes still fixed to mine, and began running her hands seductively over her body. "Don't be nervous, sweetheart." This was when I noticed that her voice had this weird sort of buzz to it, a sort of hypnotic droning to it; one that started making me feel sleepy for some reason. I heard her chuckle amusedly, the way a parent does when their child gets stage fright. "Come on, I thought you wanted a challenge..."

She began kneading her breasts through the tight hot pink leather suit she was wearing, letting her tongue hang out a bit, twitching fervently to draw me closer. My foot stepped forward of its own will, completely unaware to the rest of me. The other then followed. I was at least 5 or 6 steps in the room before I realized I was actually approaching the bed. The door shut behind me. Scarlet continued swiveling her hips on the bed, curling her finger at me.

In another two seconds that felt like they'd passed even quicker, as in microseconds, I found myself at the edge of the bed. For the first time I'd ever seen, a small smirk parted the right corner of her mouth before she leaned forward, almost touching noses with me. My heart froze in my chest, my hair stood erect, and my body went completely numb. Her slim index finger touched the bottom of my lip and she spoke again, this time her voice being almost unrecognizably distorted.

*"You want me baby?"*

Her finger slowly slid down from my lip and down the front of my chest. The overpowering warmth from the room focused itself directly in the center of my chest. Then her hand slid down further, the warmth spreading with it as it went.

*"Will you beg me?"*

In the upper edge of my vision, I watched her other hand reach up and begin unzipping her suit. Bit by bit, the zipper parted, exposing more and more of her heavenly, milky white cleavage. My eyes remained choked by hers. About midway down her suit, she stopped and pinched the upper right corner, tugging at it, teasing me into thinking she'd reveal her bare naked breast. Her tongue came out again, making a licking motion at me.

*"Beg me like a little puppy?"*

She gasped in ecstasy.

*"I wanna hear you squeal for me, big boy. Will you do that for me? Will you squeal like a good boy?"*

Warmth spread all throughout my body now. I couldn't properly breathe, with my lungs feeling like a red hot metal vice was clamping them together. Her other hand snaked down from my stomach and down to my legs. Immediately, I felt something akin to hot coals being pressed against my crotch the second her hand reached my hips. *What the fuck is this? Why does it burn so much?*

*"You feel that, baby?"*

the back of her hand gently touched my thigh, causing the burning to worsen. I heard her chuckle, seeing me wince.

*"What's the matter? Can't take the heat I see in your eyes?"*

My body was on fire now. Her hand hovered over my crotch. From the bottom edge of my vision, I watched her hand move in this weird, snake-ish motion, like she was bending some sort of energy from it. I say that because I noticed as she did this, the heat started flaring tremendously from my crotch. She was essentially setting them on fire, only without any flames to speak of. Yet.

*"Is it too much, baby? Can't take it?"*

She laughed again. She rolled out her tongue again to lick my lips teasingly.

*"Your skin tastes so good. So moist and tender..."* 

She moaned softly. Just then, a feeling as though she were reaching down my throat and pulling something out of me had me gasping for air. Imagine how it'd feel to have your intestinal tract get pulled from your throat like party ribbons, then imagine that once it's forced all they way from your throat, there's no intestines, just a large white cloud or mist. What the hell it was or how it came out of me were things I couldn't hope to answer until she said what she did two seconds later.

*"God, I can't wait to taste your soul."*

My heart went haywire after that. She threw her head back, opening her mouth, before making this weird sort of screeching or howling sound; one similar to the way a rushing wind might sound like, that sucked the white mist into her mouth, devouring it. That was when everything went dark. 

Everything around me was pitch black, though not entirely the way you're thinking here. Imagine a color somehow even darker than the color black. "Blacker-black", if that could ever be a thing. Maybe I should put it like this, imagine that darkness itself somehow had a digestive system and was slowly, painfully -- excruciatingly so -- crushing and breaking you down. That's what this was. The darkness was eating me.

While this happened, I felt heat flare up from beneath me. *What is this, where am I? Am I dead, where--*

The heat transformed then into searing pain. It's difficult for me to describe the pain, as it wasn't so much a physical pain, if that makes any sense. It was almost spiritual. It was as if my soul was... was...

*Oh God, my soul is being digested! I'm in her fucking stomach!* Looking downward, I saw that while I kept the overall *shape* of my body, I was no longer actually *in* my body. Everything on me was a wispy, cloudy mist like aura, floating in a black sea of absolute nothing. I reached out to grab onto... well, I guess nothing, but when I did, my hand was immediately scorched. 

I looked upward to see a shining light, bright and blinding. Figuring it for the exit, I started jumping and reaching up for it, only for it to do me absolutely no good. Funny enough, though, just a second or two after I'd given this up, I found myself getting forced upward toward it. Equally ironic was the fact that as this happened, I was fighting like hell to keep myself anchored. Regardless, though, I found myself in the light. 

I looked out and found that I was looking at myself. In front of me, standing up from having apparently fallen, I stared right back into my own eyes, except no, they *weren't* mine anymore. It was my face, my body, but it wasn't me anymore. "I" had a look on my face of utter shock. A look of relief, in a twisted sort of way. "I-I..." he stuttered, "I'm free! I'm finally fucking free!" He began cackling before running out of the champagne room. 

I -- the *actual* me, I guess -- remained on the bed. I wanted to go out after him; see what the hell was going on, why the hell he was in *my* body, and what happened to me, but whenever I tried to move my arms, nothing budged. I was a statue, staring into the empty champagne room as two of the bouncers walked in and looked at me. Even if I had control of my limbs in that moment, I was so shocked, confused, afraid, and just plain scrambled at that point that I likely wouldn't have moved anyway.

Imagine then how much *more* my heart was thrown into high gear when I watched the two men's eyes start glowing a bright shade of dark red. One of them opened their mouth and said in an impossibly deep, echoing voice that also had a buzz in it similar to Scarlett, "So, you let another one out, huh?"

From my mouth, though not through my control or with my voice, I replied, "What can I say?" The right arm then raised and rubbed her stomach. "This one is so much more delicious." 

The other bouncer then said in a deep voice, "You realize the more you do this, the more you risk word of us getting to the outside world."

"He's right. You have *got* to be more careful."

A giggle came from me before saying, "You guys *always* worry too much. You know I can just make sure their mushy little minds don't remember a thing after a night with me back at home." A snicker, and then, "After all, you always say it yourselves, they see me, awake or asleep."

The two men, one of which I actually recognized to be the bartender, both rolled their eyes before turning and leaving the room, leaving me... *us,* I guess, alone. I tried screaming out, but it was no use. This body wasn't mine, therefore it wouldn't answer to me. I was simply trapped, her little belly slave, trapped forever to never be digested, but instead tormented, until she'd let me out in favor of someone else. Obviously, I'm not even going to try guessing how long I was forced to stay like this, but suffice to say, I was in there for a good while. Long enough where I can safely empathize with Jonah in the fish's stomach.

Actually, no, I think I can safely say that I had it *worse* than Jonah. At least with him, sure it smelled like rancid carcasses and every different type of shit imaginable, but at least that's *all.* He didn't have to experience that, plus constantly writhing in unimaginable searing pain from flames that weren't even there, plus get tormented by the voice of his captor, reminding him what a pathetic excuse for an act of creation he is, PLUS not be able to move his own goddamn body! And to top it all off, he only had to spend *3 days*! Again, don't know how long exactly I was trapped, but it sure as hell was longer than 3 fuckin' days. 

Well anyway, finally, I guess I *was* boring her out because one day I remember watching her as she led another poor horny bastard just like me into the back room. This dude, young and obviously athletic, was eager for Scarlett. Part of me, despite knowing that I was about to be free at last, couldn't help but feel bad for the guy, knowing what was about to happen to him. *Poor, poor moron...*

To make a long story short here, the process for him was more or less the same as it was for me before -- if only the fact that it took even *less* time for his soul to get snatched from his body than it did me. As for me, well, like last time, one moment, I'm watching this guy's body fall to the floor while his soul gets snatched from his body, and the next, I'm seeing absolutely nothing until a second or two later when I'm once again looking at Scarlett Widow on the bed with her head thrown back. 

I looked at my hands, the hands that *were* someone else's only twenty seconds ago, before attempting to move my legs. They were stiff at first, wobbly and crooked, but soon I managed to work my way back to my feet before stepping backward. I was out. I was free.

I turned and stumbled away as frantically as I could out of the champagne room and out of the club altogether. I wasn't a screaming, raving lunatic about it (even if I w*asn't* too far from having the mind of one), as my mind was now just far too entangled with questions -- least of all, funny enough, having to do with how to get my body back or even if I could. I was more concerned now with what the hell those things were, why they were doing this, and how to warn anyone else from falling into her little trap. 

That brings me here. I'm reaching out, both to ask if anyone here knows anything about who or what Scarlett Widow *really* is, and/or if it's possible and how to reverse what she's done to me and God only knows how many others. That, and to warn others to stay away from *The Queen's lounge* while I still can. See, thing is, she wasn't kidding when she said that I'd see her in my dreams, and that she'd slowly strip me of my memory. I'm starting to forget more and more of who I even am, or maybe *was*, as a person before. What I've told here is about all I have left as far as my memory goes. I'm almost willing to bet money, though, that after tonight, I won't even have this much to remember...
