*Out of every one-hundred men, ten shouldn’t even be there, eighty are just targets, nine are the real fighters, and we are lucky to have them, for they make the battle. Ah, but the one, one is a warrior, and he will bring the others back.* \- *Heraclitus*

I found the quote in a library book when I was eleven. Someone had dog-eared the page and circled it. Page 47 of “*Warrior's Philosophy By L. Duat”*. Why was an eleven year old sat reading about war?

It’s what you do when your step-father forgets you exist and your mother’s too busy shooting up. I tore it out and kept the page through Basic at Catterick, through P Company, through the Hills at Brecon.

Through three wars that mattered and five that didn’t. Even when I went private. 

By the time we were dropped into a jungle somewhere in Venezuela, the page had dissolved and it was practically carved into my soul.

“*one is a warrior, and he will bring the others back.”*

Martinez looked back at me as we moved in a formation across the sea of green, “still repeating your lullaby Marcus?” 

“Same one I read to your mother every night Martinez.” I threw him a smile. He threw me back a “Fuck you.” 

The mission was simple. We’d been contracted by a company, Duat Security, to eliminate a cartel that had set up shop in the jungle. The harsh reality of the world is that some people don’t belong and we were paid to correct that. 

Me, Martinez, Williamson, Thornberry & Chen. That was the squad. We’d completed missions in countries so far gone, you’d think we were dropped into hell to take out the devil himself. 

Intel said midnight was when the guards crossed over. Four targets who never left the main building. Duat’s sources had been watching them for weeks. After 3 hours of hiking through the jungle, we found it.  

It stuck out, a dark stain on the beauty of the jungle. A grey, concrete block. Single storey. It’s tinted windows hiding their sins from God's prying eyes, not that he fucking cared.

**10pm.**

We set up camp, and went over the plan. Martinez & Chen would circle round and enter from the back.

Thornberry would take out any that escaped from a distance. Me and Williamson would conduct the frontal assault.

“Four guards visible. Should be more for an operation this size, but maybe they were counting on the jungle to hide them?” Chen lay flat on the ground, studying the compound through his scope. “Who is this guy?”

Martinez took a sip from his canteen. “Some local fuck and his cronies who thinks they’re Pablo Escobar & Sons. Set up shop six months ago, moving product for some big guns from the south.” 

“Six months? That’s a fast come up” Williamson spat his tobacco into his empty canteen.

“They've been hitting Duat's mining crews for protection money, so they want him out of the picture.” I logged in and pulled up the aerial view on the tablet. 

“Weapons free once we breach. No collateral if possible, but priority is completion. If we get split up, the extraction point is 3 clicks to the east. If you’re not there by 4am, you’re getting left behind.” I pocketed the tablet and turned on the night vision. 

“Well, who knows. I might like it here after we’re finished”. Thornberry picked up his rifle and started towards his nest.

“See you on the other side boys.”

“I'm off to take a leak, I suggest you do the same. We're not stopping till we hit the extraction point once we're done” I turned, stepping deeper into the jungle. 

**11:55pm.** 

Martinez & Chen radioed that they were in position. 

**11:58pm.**

Thornberry whispered he had eyes on the building. 

**11:59pm.**

Williamson placed the charges. 

**Midnight.** 

“Go.” 

This is what no one gets right in the movies. There isn’t any background music. There aren’t any internal debates or villains giving monologues. No flashbacks to an origin story. 

There’s simply a moment before you breach, where you can taste copper, feel your heartbeat slow, hear the jungle going silent. That's how you know you’re moving from the world of the living into the world of the dead. 

The doors blew inwards. We rushed in.

Clear.

I go left, Williamson right. Both rooms are clear.

“Back is clear. No guards here” Martinez came in through the ear piece.

“Something’s off. Where the fuck is everyone. We saw four of ‘em.” Williamson whispered, his barrel searching for a target. 

The four of us met in the middle. 

“Do you smell that?” Chen sniffed the air. It smelt like rotting flesh, and ash. I held back a gag. 

“It’s coming from below.” Martinez pointed towards the rug, someone had done a shit job of covering their tracks.

We rolled back the rug. Chen & Williamson gently lifted the doors a crack, I threw in a flash-bang. 

Waited, opened, aimed. 

Clear.

Nothing but darkness, even the rats were hiding. 

We descended down the stairs. The tunnel below had been carved recently - tool marks still fresh on the earth, pickaxes and shovels abandoned against the walls.

The walls were covered in markings. They were carved deep enough that shadows pooled in them like black water. The air grew thicker as we went deeper.

Martinez traced his fingers near one of the markings, careful not to touch. "What kind of weird cartel shit is this..."

We inched ahead slowly as the ground tilted downwards. Water seeped through the ceiling, but it smelled wrong - metallic, like pennies but worse. A few minutes later, it opened outwards into a large cavern.

“Hold, switch off your night-vision ” Martinez pointed two fingers ahead. “Got a visual on targets, two o’clock, 20 metres”

Through the green wash of my night vision, I saw it - a bright white bloom of light.

“Fucking amateurs” Chen whispered.

My eyes slowly adjusted back to the darkness as we made our way forward. “Permission to take out targets, oh great warrior” Martinez took aim.

“Gra-” The fire went out.

“Fuck, get off me - someo-” Chen shouted as  he fell backwards. One of them had snuck around, surprising him from the back. 

I aimed, single shot.

The robed figure fell, a red circle forming on his chest.

Two more followed from the side.

Two shots.

Martinez & Williamson took them out.

I never saw the one from above.

How the fuck he’d got up there, I don’t know.

He landed on me, whispering something as he pinned me down. I thought he was begging for his life. 

Before I could even get my knife free, he raised his and slit his own throat. Showering me in his blood. 

“What the fuck were these guys smoking” Chen scrambled to this feet. 

“And how the fuck did they clear that distance, that fast?” Martinez kicked one, checking for life. 

“Let’s just confirm the kills and get out of here.” I stood, wiping the blood from my face.

“Oh fuck. fuck” Williamson stumbled back, crashing into Martinez.

We aimed, expecting combatants. 

I followed the others eyes to the body.

Lying there, unmasked, was a child.

We removed the hoods from the others.

All of them.

They were all children.

“What the fuck, that makes no sense. We scouted, there were four guys. We saw them. They matched the intel.” Martinez paced.

“Don’t lose your shit, they’ve probably hidden somewhere, or escaped. We need to stay focused.”

I radioed Thornberry.

“Thornberry, come in.” 

Static.

“Let’s get out of here first, there’s no fucking signal.”

I moved back towards the cavern entrance. We searched the building twice, no one.

“Thornberry, do you read?” I made my way to the doorway.

“He’s not responding, switching back to night vision.” I led them out, back into the sea of jungle green.

*“One is a warrior, and brings the others back.”* 

We made our way to Thornberry's marked position, 

He’d never made it to the nest, we found him lying in a pool of his own blood. Throat cut.

“Fuck, they knew we were coming.” Martinez shakingly lit a cigarette.“

This doesn’t make sense, he confirmed his position” I took a nervous swig from my canteen, the humidity of the jungle felt heavier. Wrong, somehow. I spat the water out. It tasted like copper.

The fucking blood had gotten everywhere.

“We need to move. Now.” Chen  moved deeper towards the treeline.

“Agreed. Extraction point, 3 clicks west.”

I checked my watch.  

**01:30.**

We had time.

We moved in a tight formation through the green. My head pounding - a remnant from bouncing my head off the floor in the cavern. 

“Movement, ten o’clock!” Martinez hissed. I spun, and saw nothing.

“Where?”

“It was right-” Martinez froze. 

“CONTACT!” Chen's rifle erupted.

Muzzle flashes in the dark. We scattered and took cover. 

“Where are they?” Williamson blasted through my earpiece.

“I can’t see shit!” Martinez was firing blind. 

Then nothing. Just our breathing and the silence of the jungle.

“Chen, report”. 

Silence.

“Chen!”

**02:15**

We found Chen face down in a creek, 200 meters from where we took cover.

The back of his skull caved in with a rock.

“They’re fucking with us” Martinez smoked his sixth cigarette. “Jungle Psychos”.

Williamson pointed at the tree ahead. “Look at that”

Carved into the bark: five stick figures. One standing, four lying down.

“What the -” 

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath.

I had to focus.

“*Nine are the real fighters, but the one, one is chosen, and he carries them home* “

The quote. Why couldn't I remember it right?

Fucking concussion. 

I kept trying to blink away the spots in my vision. I stumbled. I began to gag, as if something was crawling it's way out from deep within, up my throat.

“Hey you good?” Williamson  started walking over to me. 

I looked down at what I’d thrown up, it was Thornberry and Chen’s dog tags.

“Yeah, fine, just a bad head.” I stumbled up.

I was starting to hallucinate. We needed to get to the extraction point. Fast.

**02:45**

“We’re being hunted. They’re fucking hunting us”. Martinez kept checking our six. “That wasn't a cartel. There wasn’t any fucking product in that compound.” 

My vision kept swimming. The jungle floor seemed to pulse. The tree branches squirmed around me. The heavy air of the jungle felt like it was slowly constricting around me.

“Marcus, you good?” Williamson grabbed me as I stumbled.

“Fine - I’m fine, let’s  keep moving.” I closed my eyes, counted my breaths.

Martinez stopped. “You hear that?”

He crouched, squinting at something in the distance.

It was distant but audible.

You could just about hear it over the silence of the jungle.

Children singing. 

“There’s fucking kids out he-”Martinez gurgled. 

A knife was in his throat.

My knife.

But I was five feet away.

I looked down at my hands, why were they covered in blood?

Why was I pulling Martinez’s head back?

He looked up and his eyes met mine. Stretched wide, questioning. 

“What the fuck!” Williamson pushed me to the ground. “You just-” He tried to stop the bleeding.

*"Out of every hundred men, ninety-nine are taken, and one is chosen to bring them inside."*

I lay on the floor, heaving, catching my breath.

I turned and Martinez’s eyes met mine. He’d already taken his last.

**03:30**

“Stay the fuck back, Marcus.”

He kept his rifle trained on me as we walked.

“I - I didn’t - You saw the hostiles -”

“There were no fucking hostiles. You fucking killed him. Did you kill Chen? Thornberry? ” His voice cracked with rage.

“I was there the entire -  I  “ And that’s when I saw them.

The four guards we spotted when we’d arrived. 

They hung from the trees. Their tongues swollen, blue. Their eyes staring down at me, questioning why?

"Look, Williamson! The guards -"

"There's nothing there, you psycho fuck." He pushed me forward.

The children from the cave sat there on the branches, swinging their feet.

I watched their mouths move, but no sound reached my ears.

"*One is chosen. One brings them. One carries them. They're all inside the one."*

**04:00**

"Wheres the rest of your team?” The pilot looked around nervously.

“KIA. Ambush.” I stumbled inside.

“Jesus, You good? You’re covered -”

“Not mine.” 

I fell into the darkness.

\---

I'm not sure how long it's been since Venezuela. I'm back home now.

There was a debrief when I got back. Duat paid handsomely.

Lisa handled the paperwork while I was still getting patched up. She always handles the paperwork.

Mission successful, I guess.

I don't remember when Lisa started living here. She was here when I got back, there’s pictures of us on the wall I don't remember taking. 

They say the amnesia is part of the trauma.

There's even one of my old squad from Kandahar. She's in the background, out of focus. I never served with a woman in Kandahar

She says I've been sleepwalking. Every morning she washes the dirt from under my nails, tends to the scratches.

She hums while she works. The same tune the children sang, but she stops when I stare too long.

And sometimes, I can see them. Through the corner of my eye, in my shadow.

Thornberry, Chen, Martinez, Williamson.

And sometimes, if the light's right, the children too.

All of them standing behind me. Waiting.

Lisa never looks at my shadow. She says there's nothing there, but she's never looked. 

Not once.

This morning she made me eggs. Over easy. While I ate, she opened her laptop.

"Duat emailed," she said, not looking up. 

"They want you to lead another team. Four men. Fresh squad. I've already confirmed your availability."

I never told her my login credentials.

She's had my favourite quote framed on our wall. I watched her hang it yesterday. 

*"Out of every hundred men, ninety-nine feed the one. Ah, but the one, he feeds* [god.](https://www.reddit.com/user/sovereignweaver/comments/1njo347/the_duat_corporation_files/)*"*
