*Okay, so usually I don’t like to actually get involved in internet drama, I usually prefer to just watch the train wrecks, but this one is getting pretty weird and I really want some advice. It all started about a year ago, I have been following this influencer, Shayla, for a while. She is the most vapid, entitled brat of a woman I have ever seen but I don’t know if I can claim to be any better because really I just follow her so I can take screenshots of her ridiculous posts and laugh about them with my friends. Anyway, she mostly just posts workout updates and pictures of horrible-looking green smoothies, but things have started to feel a bit more serious lately. I have included a bunch of her blog posts below, can you all please read over them and tell me if I am being crazy?*

Hey guys, Shayla here!!!!

How are you all doing? As you know I have been patiently (more like impatiently) waiting for Jase to propose and I honestly think this might be the day! Eeeeeeek! He has been super secretive lately and he just sent me a text this morning, guess what he said??! “We need to talk”. Eeeeek I am just about bursting! So of course I left work early, I was way too buzzed to concentrate. Just trying to decide what dress I should wear for him tonight. Have a look through some of my insta photos and let me know your favourites.

Anyway, love you all and will keep you updated!!!! xoxo

Hey guys, Shayla here again!

A bunch of you messaged me saying that I need to get my nails done ASAP and I can’t believe I didn’t think of it. What good are insta ring pics if my nails look like crap? So I called to get a last-minute appointment and oh my god the woman at the salon was such a bitch. She said they were fully booked and there was no way they would be able to fit me in at such short notice but I let her know how many followers I had and made it clear that they would regret a bad review from me and what do you know they found a spot for me. I will let you know if they are any good.

Anyway, have to head out. Will put pics up for you all xoxo

&#x200B;

**09/04/2022 - 05.47pm**

Hey guys, Shaylah here!

Super quick update. Nails are done (honestly not the best I have had and the staff there were total dicks, they didn’t even offer me any coffee while I waited, ugh!) would not recommend “Serenity Nails” :( but they look OK enough for pictures. I went with your recommendations and I am in the green dress I wore last Christmas and I have a nice light pink nail polish and I did some of that subtle eye shadow from that video I did last Valentine’s Day… oh shit I think I heard his car. Omg!!!

Will update soon babes xoxo

&#x200B;

**09/04/2022 - 8.16pm**

WHAT THE FUCK? YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FUCKING BELIEVE THIS. HE FUCKING LEFT ME. HE SAID HE WAS IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE AND HE IS MOVING OUT. I CANT FUCKING EVEN DEAL. 

&#x200B;

**09/05/2022 06.00am**

Hey guys, Shaylah here!

So sorry about my last update. I was feeling a little out of sorts that day. Anyway, I need my amazing gals to help me out with something. I need to find out where someone called Jane Tallerson lives. Google has only gotten me so far and I need to narrow down the deets a little bit more. I know you all have such amazing networks and connections going on out there and you have pulled through for me in the past, so either leave a message on this post or PM me.

Love you all xoxo

&#x200B;

**09/07/2022 - 07.38am**

Hey guys, Shaylah here!

Appreciate all the love and support coming through but honestly, I am trying not to dwell on anything. I know Jase has just made a huge mistake and this bitch has obviously tricked him or brainwashed him or something. I just need to find out where he is so I can go and talk some sense into him.

Keep those PM’s coming please ladies! We can crack this one xoxo

&#x200B;

**09/07/2022 - 10.18pm**

Hey guys, Shaylah here!

Great work everyone! We now have an address and I am in my car right outside! So excited to see Jase and remind him of where he belongs and who he belongs with and to give this Jane a piece of my mind.

Anyway, will update soon babes xoxo

&#x200B;

**09/12/2022 - 9.29am**

Hey guys, Shaylah here!

So sorry for my lack of posting lately. I have so many PM’s from you all checking up on me and I so appreciate it. Honestly, massive love and kisses to you all xxx I have just been so swamped dealing with my lawyers and trying to get in touch with Jase. Anyway, if any of you are lawyers please get in touch! I could so do with some extra advice on how to get out of this restraint order. My lawyer said that because I physically attacked this Jane bitch that there is no way for me to appeal the order in court and she won’t even listen to me when I tell her she totally deserved it and I didn’t even pull any of her real hair out, it was just some nasty as extensions.

Anyway, as I said any advice is much appreciated, love you babes xoxo

&#x200B;

**09/17/2022 - 2.06pm**

Hey guys, Shaylah here!

Thanks again for all your lovely messages. I am working on a bunch of your suggestions including buying a new sim so I can message Jase (I think that bitch must have blocked my number on his phone? Honestly who does she even think she is?) Anyway, I have been messaging from the new number, I have posted and hand-delivered letters to his work (I am not allowed within 60ft of him so I have to be careful with this one, lucky I have seen Charlies Angles enough to know how to be sneaky!) and I have been emailing him from a bunch of new email addresses I have made. Still no reply though, she must be intercepting everything. Ugh, I just need her out of my fucking life!

Keep the suggestions coming guys! Xoxo

&#x200B;

**09/27/2022 - 04.28am**

Hey guys, Shaylah here.

Ugh, I don’t know what is going on with me lately. All this stress is messing with my body big time. I have been spewing like heaps and have had these awful headaches. I have been sticking to a total plant-based diet and have started on vitamin B12 because it’s meant to help with stress (thanks for the suggestion u\_babe\_1991) but I am still feeling like total shit :( Any home remedies for this nausea ladies? Willing to try anything right now!

Love you all xoxo

&#x200B;

**09/27/2022 - 3.17pm**

Hey guys, Shaylah here!

Ok all my ladies with medical qualifications, I need you to put your thinking caps on. If my last period was on the 2nd August and me and Jase did ‘you know what’ on the 16th August, is there any way I could be pregnant? No, I’m just being crazy, right? Right guys?

Help please, I am freaking out!!!!

&#x200B;

**09/27/2022 - 4.52pm**

Hey guys, Shaylah here!

Oh. My. God! You were all messaging me like crazy that it was totally possible and that I absolutely had to take a test so I raced straight down to the store and brought a whole bunch and I did like 6 of them already and girls, you are not going to believe this. I AM PREGNANT! This is the best news ever!!! How is he going to stay with her now? He will have to come back. Eeeeeek I can’t even believe this horrible nightmare is going to be over soon. Can not wait to get back to normal and to start planning my forever life with Jase again.

Start sending your baby name suggestions though please! I want to have a good list by the time I tell Jase!!! xoxo

&#x200B;

**10/09/2022 - 02.04am**

Hey guys, Shaylah here!

Sorry again for the lack of updates! Things have been just absolutely crazy! As you know from my insta stories I have had the biggest nightmare of my life trying to get past that bitch and talk to Jase. They have this new alarm system set up so the last time I went there the police showed up and I was given a second warning. They said that if I show up again they will arrest me! They didn’t even listen to me when I said it was of vital importance that I speak to Jase. Like why don’t they go and chase actual criminals? I am just a helpless pregnant woman trying to fix things with the love of her life. Anyway, I have been chatting to a few of you in the comments and it seems like the only way forward is to go ahead with the pregnancy without him knowing, then once the baby is born I will show up at his door step and he will have to take us back. Who would pick that skank over me and our perfect baby?

Oh also, do any of you have any good holistic midwife recommendations? This has all come as such a surprise I have not had any time to plan or research like I would have liked but you know I will be having a home birth of course and no medicalised quack doctor is going to touch me!

Thanks again for the amazing love and support and the amazeballs recipes you have all been sending through! The ginger cookies to help with nausea worked a charm (thanks to get-it-gal for that recommendation and you were right, the fresh ginger totally made it) and thanks for the idea to start putting Shea butter on my belly now. I definitely want to keep away from those nasty stretch marks so any suggestions will be tried.

Love you babes xoxo

&#x200B;

**12/20/2022 - 7.34am**

Hey babes, Shaylah here!

5 months today! Can not believe how quickly time is flying in this pregnancy. As you all know I have been posting a bunch in my stories on insta cause it’s a little quicker than posting here and I have been so strapped for time with the legal issues, the Jase issues (still haven’t made contact) and keeping up with the online store. Anyway, the pregnancy is going perfectly! My nausea has totally gone and I am feeling amazing. My belly is constantly greased up and not a stretch mark in sight even though my little bump is getting bigger every day. I haven’t had any luck finding a midwife I trust. They all say I should deliver at the hospital because my family history makes me high risk but as if. I know my body and I know what’s right for my baby and me. If I need to do this on my own then so be it.

Check out insta to see a video of her doing a little jig in there. She is such a wriggly little boo ( no scans of course but I can just tell she is a girl).

Keep the name suggestions coming! Rose is top of the list at the moment, but of course, I won’t confirm anything till I have talked to Jase.

&#x200B;

**01/31/2023 - 2.06am**

Hey gals, Shaylah here!

Sorry again for the lack of updates! Things have just been so crazy with the business and you know growing a whole baby! For those of you who have been pregnant, did you find the baby moved less when you got to 7 months? She must be running out of space in there!

Can’t wait to meet her and of course to introduce her to you amazing ladies.

Couldn’t be doing this without you all xoxo

&#x200B;

**04/02/2023 - 9.17pm**

Hey gals, Shaylah here.

I think I am getting sick :( So not the right time for this! I have about 50 orders to get out and I am still doing my meal prepping for when baby arrives. I don’t want Jase to come home to a house of chaos. Just because I am having a baby doesn’t mean I can’t keep a good house for him. Ugh, I think I have a temperature and I feel like my heart is racing out of my chest.

Does anyone have any good smoothie recipes for these symptoms?

Love you all xoxo

&#x200B;

**04/03/2023 - 1.07am**

Guys,

Could I be going into labour? It’s 5 weeks early but you all know I was never very sure about my dates. I am feeling even more rubbish and still have a fever but paracetamol isn’t safe for baby so I am using cool cloths on my forehead. Just feeling really crampy and (total tmi!!!) but I there was some sticky stuff when I wiped after peeing before with some blood in it. A bunch of the baby books say that’s often how labour starts.

Let’s hope this fever breaks soon. And come on baby girl, I am ready to meet you and I know your daddy will be too xoxo

&#x200B;

**04/03/2023 - 6.54am**

Guys,

This is it! My waters broke about half an hour ago. The stuff that came out was a bit funny-coloured and (sorry more tmi!!!) honestly didn’t smell amazing. I looked in the books and couldn’t find anything about that but I am trusting in my body and the process. Feeling a little lonely though so keep your messages coming in.

Did any of you have waters like this? xoxo

&#x200B;

**04/04/2023 - 7.32pm**

Hey gals,

Um, I am getting a lot of messages saying I need to go to the hospital and stuff like that and I honestly just really don’t appreciate it. I know my own body and I am trusting in the process and all of this negative energy is messing with my head. For all of you sending your love and positive vibes though I am so feeling it, mwah! Things are getting stronger now so fingers crossed it won’t be too much longer xxx I will be filming it and posting the video once she is here. Eeeep!

Kisses x

&#x200B;

**04/05/2023 - 10.15am**

Hey gals, Shaylah here!

Oh my god, she is here guys. I can’t believe I did it! It was definitely the most difficult thing I have ever done and I was so sad not to have Jase here to support me but I am stoked I had time to get the camera on so at least he will be able to watch it later. It was different than I thought. I was still feeling really sick and when I started feeling like I needed to push there was lots of blood and stuff coming out. I was pushing really hard but it still ended up taking ages for her to come. I think I was pushing for like 5 hours but when she arrived it was so worth the pain! Guys, she is just so amazing. She is perfect like an angel and so well-behaved. She hasn’t even cried once.

Quick question for all the other mommies out there. How soon can you give a baby their first bath? She is a little stinky and I think she could do with one (I thought that new baby smell was supposed to be amazing but I am not getting into this!).

Photos to come soon babes xxx

&#x200B;

**04/05/2023 - 5.32pm**

Hey babes,

A bunch of you have been saying not to give her a bath yet but I already did! The smell was just getting to me :( Anyway, I made sure the room was nice and warm and she didn’t fuss at all. When do babies first open their eyes? So excited to see what colour hers are gonna be! There was a little blood in the bath water, is that normal?

Thanks for the help mommies! I’m not finding the parenting books super relevant or helpful tbh, even the ones you all recommended.

Gonna be heading out to Jase’s soon so he can meet his gorgeous girl for the first time. I was gonna wait and tell him first but you have all been so amazing this past year so I’m gonna let you know, I’m calling her Lola <3

Family pics to come soon!!! xxx

*Okay, it's me again. So I’m not going crazy, right? I’m really worried about her and the baby but she hasn’t posted in a while. Do I need to call the cops or something? A bunch of us have been commenting and private messaging her but no replies since her last update. Anyway, maybe I am just too deep in this. Let me know what you think I should do.*
