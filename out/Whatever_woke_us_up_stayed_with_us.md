I (18f) was spending the night at my boyfriend‘s (17m) place, since his mom was out of town and he needed help watching his little brother (12m). It was only us three in the house and the house has an advanced security system, not to mention we locked all the doors and pulled down all the blinds before heading to bed. There was no way anyone could have entered. 

It was around 2 am, when I was roughly shaken awake by my boyfriend‘s very frightened brother, who told me that he heard me screaming loudly, like I was being hurt. He’s talking about those classic horror movie screams you hear when the main protagonist finally sees the ghost that’s been pestering them. At this point I am genuinely confused because for one, I merely talk in my sleep and have never been told that I actually scream or shout and for two, wouldn’t my boyfriend have heard it as well since he was right next to me? I asked my boyfriend‘s brother if maybe he only imagined it, but he assured me that it was my voice and coming from this exact room. After he told me that, my boyfriend started to stir right next to me, just as confused as we all were from the situation. 

I explained the situation to him and he told me, that he didn’t hear anything at all. My boyfriend then started arguing with his brother, accusing him of lying and using creepy shit to get my attention. For context, me and my boyfriend‘s brother have always been close and get along really well, my boyfriend is the typical annoyed older brother, who loves to tease and torment his younger sibling. Ever since we got together my boyfriend‘s little brother has been wanting to hangout with us more than usual, which lead my boyfriend to become slightly jealous every time he hung out with us, even if there’s no actual „danger“ of me leaving him for a 12 year old. 

Anyways, after they were done arguing, my boyfriend kicked his younger brother out of our room and went back to bed. I was completely rigid and was still sitting in bed, frozen in my spot, because I am someone who believes in paranormal shit and actually get scared easily. My boyfriend on the other hand was completely chilling and convinced nothing was wrong, putting his arms around me and telling me, „He will protect me from any ghosts“. Then when I slowly calmed down and started to doze off, I heard footsteps in the hallway. At first it was the normal kind, then it got louder and heavier to the point my boyfriend snapped up from his spot. I told him, that this wasn’t a joke and that something was actually wrong, but he brushed it off again by telling me, „it’s just my brother playing tricks again“. 

We both got out of bed and opened the door to the hallway. Outside in the hallway, my boyfriend’s little brother was also standing in his doorway, looking for the source of the sound. My boyfriend‘s little brother thought it was my boyfriend getting revenge on him and my boyfriend thought it was his brother, still playing pranks on us. Guess they were both wrong, since we all stood frozen in place and the footsteps were walking around right between us in the hallway. For context, their hallway is big af, the distance between my bf‘s door and his brother‘s door is maybe 6 meters and the top of the staircase leading downstairs is also from where the footsteps were coming from. It sounded like someone was walking circles right in front of us, without someone actually being there. I was completely taken aback and immediately opened my arms for my boyfriend’s brother to come to me, as soon as the brother leaped into my arms the footsteps stopped and we froze in place. 

Finally, my boyfriend regained his logical thinking and immediately rushed us into his own room, locking the door. As he shoved us inside I saw a tall, shadowy figure enter the en-suite in my boyfriends room. I told them, that „it“ is here and pointed to the en-Suite. My boyfriend was in denial of an actual ghost or paranormal being haunting us and confidently stepped into the en-suite. Me and the brother went to look into the en-suite as well, clinging to each other like our life depends on it, but we didn’t see anything except my boyfriend turning around, shrugging and holding up his arms, telling us „I told you so“. After that we debriefed the whole thing for about an hour straight, my boyfriend comforting both me and his brother like he invented Ghostbusters himself. 

In the end, his brother ended up spending the night with us in bed and nothing unusual happened. Then in the next morning, my boyfriend got up from bed and I noticed one big scratch on one of his arms, which definitely wasn’t there when we went to sleep. It wasn’t even red, it was faint but obvious enough to notice. Yes, I have long nails but those don’t scratch deep enough to leave marks like that. And no, my boyfriend never had scars on his arms before, so it can’t be a reopened wound or something like that. 

Safe to say, my boyfriend’s little brother slept in his room three more days after the incident, but nothing else has happened. This happened about two weeks ago and I visited him even after the incident and even I didn’t notice anything unusual. I just don’t know what that was, that scratched my boyfriend or walked around the house. For the main part I am freaked out because of my apparent scream that woke his brother up. If anyone knows what this could be, feel free to tell me.
