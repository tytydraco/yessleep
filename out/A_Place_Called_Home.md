Thomas Wolfe once said you can never go home again. That's not always true, though. Sometimes you can go home again...if you're determined enough. And brave enough.

I finally summoned the courage to go home after twenty-five years. Twenty-five years of fleeing from the past and my memories of Allison.

I took the day off and left my apartment in the city around nine that morning (last Friday) and made the two-hour drive out into the country, and the further I got from the city, the closer I got to the house, the more I felt myself slipping slowly back into the past.

"As you can see, it needs a little work," the realtor had has told us.

Allison flashed me a sly smile behind the man's back. 'A little work' was an understatement. The old farmhouse was extremely run-down, which was why it was on the market at such a low price. The paint was peeling, the floors were rotted, the wiring was shot, the plumbing was rusted out, and most of the window frames had been eaten through by termites. I had told her rather dryly on the drive that it would have been more practical to bulldoze the place and rebuild it from the ground up, but she would not be swayed by my arguments. She had been steadfast in her drive to renovate the old house, as long as it took and however much it cost. A place out in the country, away from the chaotic, fast-paced crush of the city with its crowds and pollution and noise. A nice quiet place just for us, and the family we planned to someday raise.

I learned early in our relationship it was wise not to fight Allison when she set her mind on something; she was a very determined young woman. That was only one of the qualities that had attracted me to her in college.

In the end, she had won...although I suppose I had only been putting up a front in order to try and maintain a facade of masculine assertiveness. Token resistance in a vain and feeble bid to preserve my precious role as the Dominant Male. Macho posturing. And I think we had both known that. In truth, I would have given her the moon if she had asked for it. I had loved her that much...

I felt tears begin to seep down my cheeks as I drove on the interstate, remembering.

We had bought the old house and the four acres of land it sat upon with the money we had been saving together for the three years we had been married. We had spent the next year fixing the place up, doing most of the work ourselves. Allison's father had been a carpenter, and she'd learn a lot of the trade from him growing up. I vividly recall the days we had spent hammering and sawing and painting, the smell of sawdust and fresh paint and varnish...

The city was behind me now, I drove through the suburbs, recalling our mutual elation when the work had been finished, the old house now looking as if it had been newly constructed. New floors, new windows, new roof, new plumbing and electricity. The two of standing outside, admiring the house's pristine white paint and green trim. Allison laughing.  Our embrace and kiss.

Out of the suburbs, driving on a rural highway through the country. Woods, then cornfields.

To break the silence, and to take my mind off the past, I turned on the radio. I listened, transfixed, hearing the haunting, melancholy guitar chords that open an old Goo Goo Dolls song. A song that had come out the year we had married.

I listened, numb, as the familiar first lyric came out of the speakers:

*"And even though the moment passed me by...I still can't turn away..."*

Tears blurred my vision, and I had to pull over until they abated. I forced the tears to stop, wiping my eyes, disgusted by the mental image of myself; a fifty-three-year-old man moved to tears by a stupid song from nearly thirty years ago. Pathetic.

I sat there for a while long, contemplating my motives for this journey. What the hell was I doing? What was the point of this? What did I hope to accomplish going back to that house? The past was long gone. As dead and buried as Allison was. Why was I stirring up memories that were best forgotten? Was I trying vainly to recapture the essence of a time that was irrevocably lost, trying to live in my recollections of the past? Or was I just attempting to confront my past once and for all, to fully come to term with what had happened so I could finally and truly put it behind me once and for all, to heal and move on?

I considered just turning back and heading home. But I was only a couple miles from my objective now. To admit defeat and retreat when I was so close, when I had already come so far, would be to acknowledge my own cowardice to myself.

I pulled back onto the road and continued driving.

Allison was in the seventh month of her pregnancy when it happened. She had shaken me awake in the middle of the night, panicked. Even though my brain had still been half asleep, I had been instantly aware that something was wrong. The sheets were wet and sticky. For a brief instant I had wondered if she had gone into an early labor...but only for an instant. Turning on the bedside lamp I had seen it hadn't been water the bed was soaked with. It was on everything; the blankets, my pajamas, most of all Allison. Her nightgown was saturated with the awful red wetness that was seeping from between her thighs...

I only recall the rest as a rush of blurred, dream-like impressions that can't even rightly be called memories; just hazy mental snapshots. The ambulance. The hospital. The waiting room. The anxious hours. The solemn-faced doctor in blood-spattered scrubs and his routine words of consolation and regret. The funeral. They had been buried together, in the same coffin.

There it was, just half a mile distant. The house I hadn't laid eyes on in a quarter century. The house I had left after burying Allison, fleeing for the city, determined to leave behind all vestiges of the man I had been, to bury my past with Allison and the child and become someone new, someone different. I had returned to school, earning a master's degree in Business Law. I had shaven my beard, had traded my paintbrushes and canvases and easel for a suit and a briefcase. I had thrown myself into my career, rising up to the position of Senior Partner. A brief, loveless second marriage to a woman who had been the opposite of Allison in every way (intentional on my part). No children had come of it. Private golf courses and yacht parties and business trips. My hair had thinned, my stomach had widened, I had developed an ulcer and hemorrhoids.

And through all those years, I had still retained ownership of the house, dutifully paying the property taxes each year, even though I had never returned...until now. Why had I held onto it for so long when everything else had been left behind, cast to the winds? I had burned all the pictures, destroyed all the souvenirs of the five years we had been together.  Everything that had even the most tangential connection to the only woman I had ever truly loved, desperately trying to spare myself the pain of remembering, as if by denying Allison's entire existence, I could convince myself that she had never been a part of my life.

But why had I kept the house? Why? Because Allison had loved it, that's why. Had put so much effort into restoring it. And I couldn't bear to dishonor her memory but selling it to strangers. I owed her that much, anyway. The house was a monument to her, a testament to my love for her.

I turned into the driveway, pulling up to the house and shutting off my engine. I sat there for a while, just staring at it.

It had fallen into a state of disrepair in the twenty-five years since I had left. The paint was peeling, the windows dirty, the lawn heavily overgrown. I felt my heart sink at the sight of it. It looked just as bad as it had when we had first purchased it. I had let it fall into ruin. Allison would be ashamed of my neglect.

I got out and stepped up the porch. I took out my keys, sorting through them until I found the one that hadn't been on the ring until this morning, the one I had kept in a shoebox in the back of the closet for so long. The one that unlocked the front door. The lock turned with surprising ease, as if I had only been away for a short time. In my distracted state, I attached no significance to this fact.

With a brief hesitation, I turned the knob and opened wide the door.

The smell of mildew and stale air assailed my nostrils immediately. The smell of...well, a long-vacant home that hasn't been aired out in ages. Once again, I momentarily hesitated. Then, gathering my courage, I stepped inside.

I was in the mud room that opened up onto the living room. It was gloomy; the lights were off, and the only illumination came through the windows. I instinctively flipped the light switch before remembering that the electricity wasn't paid up. It didn't matter; there was enough natural light for me to see my way.

I entered the living room and looked around with sad wonder. It was like a time capsule; everything was exactly as I had left it on that long-ago September afternoon, a week after the funeral. Newspapers and magazines dated 2000 (now yellowed and faded with age) still covered the coffee table's surface. The concave screen of the CRT TV reflected the room like a dead eye. Dust lay in a thick layer over everything.

I peered through the kitchen entryway. A bowl of ancient, petrified oranges still stood on the table, shriveled into effigies of themselves. Dusty plates were still stacked vertically in the drainer beside the sink. A dirty coffee cup that still had a scum of dried residue at the bottom stood on a saucer atop the counter next to the Silex.

I turned and headed into the hallway that led to the stairwell. This was the difficult part, the part I had been dreading. But I had to see this through. I had come all this way. Now was the time to confront the demons of my past; to exorcise them. Like a condemned man climbing the gallows, I ascended the stairs to the second floor.

A huge water stain on the hallway ceiling from where the roof had leaked. I entered the bedroom I had once shared with Allison. I stood regarding the bare mattress, where everything had gone horribly wrong, for some time. I glanced around. The framed *Eraserhead* poster on the closet door had been almost completely bleached white by the sunlight that slanted through the windows in the east wall. The dresser drawers still stood open from when I had hastily packed the few necessary belongings I had taken, abandoning everything else. The surface of Allison's vanity table was bare; I had thrown out all her cosmetics and perfumes. But yet...

I sniffed the air.

Strange. For a few seconds I seemed to detect some familiar scent in the stale air. The phantom scent lingered just long enough for me to identify it. The lavender perfume that had been Allison's favorite. No sooner did I recognize it, the scent was gone from the air. I must have imagined it.

I left the bedroom, going down to the last room at the end of the hall. I stood in the doorway.

It was the nursery we had set up. The crib stood empty, the mobile above it hung motionless. The walls were decorated with characters from *The Rugrats.* A stuffed pink bunny sat on the windowsill like a lone sentinel unaware that it was standing guard for a cause long since lost. I looked into that awful room, the room I had been avoiding for twenty-five years, the room I hadn't set foot in since the day before Allison had died. My mind conjured a vision; laid over this barren room like a double image I saw a past that had never been. A future that had never come. I could almost hear a baby crying.

That did it. I was besieged by a flood of memories, long repressed. I remembered everything with perfect recall; sounds and smells and colors.

I broke down. My knees buckled. I slid down the door jam and began to weep deeply, from the depths of my soul, my body wracked with the forceful sobs I was emitting, sobs from a well of grief and loss that had stood untapped for so many years.

At long last it ceased. When I had myself back under control, I forced myself into a standing position. I felt empty now, but not in a good, cathartic, spiritually cleansed way; just a sort of cold, blue numbness. I felt like a dead man in a tomb.

The tomb was this house.

I shouldn't have come here. This whole trip was a failure. All I had done was re-open the old wound.

I left the nursery, went down the hall, and started back downstairs to leave.

At the bottom, I halted, confused. I smelled the air again. I smelled...fresh coffee. Fried bacon. Maple syrup. I followed the scent of breakfast into the kitchen. I stood in the door, transfixed, completely nonplussed by what I was seeing.

The dust and dinginess were gone. The lights were on. The kitchen had been transformed, restored to its former immaculateness. The oranges on the table were fresh. Two plates were set out, their contents half-eaten, next to two half-drank cups of coffee.

I whirled around, started, at the sudden sound of the TV coming to life behind me. The *Today* show was on the screen, not Savannah Guthrie and Craig Melvin, but Katie Couric and Matt Lauer. The living room had likewise changed, reverted back to how it had been back in 2000, when Allison was still--

I jerked my head up at the ceiling. I could hear music upstairs. The stereo system in the bedroom was playing an old Sinead O'Connor song that Allison had loved. "Nothing Compares 2 U."

This wasn't happening. It *couldn't* be happening. I was hallucinating, or dreaming, or insane.

With dreamy slowness, I began to climb back upstairs.

In the hallway. I passed the open bedroom door without a glance, Sinead O'Connor still singing.

*"Cause nothing compares... Nothing compares to you..."*

I could hear other voices now, coming from the nursery at the end of the hallway. A woman's voice, singing a lullaby, and the high-pitched giggle of an infant.

I could smell lavender perfume.

I felt fresh tears well in my eyes and roll down my cheeks. I choked back a sob. Slowly I approached the nursery door.

She was sitting in a chair beside the crib. She was facing away, her back to me, but I recognized her long blonde hair. She was wearing her old pink bathroom. She was holding something on her lap; something bundled in a blanket. I couldn't make out what it was.

I took three steps into the nursery, then could go no further. I stood there, trembling. She continued to sing the lullaby, unaware of my presence.  I spoke her name; my voice choked with emotion.

She fell abruptly silent. A moment of silence, an eternity of silence, passed.

"Ryan," she said, without turning around, and her voice was exactly as I'd remembered it. "You finally came home. I always knew you would. We've been waiting for you for so long."

"Allison," I repeated. I seemed incapable of saying anything else.

"I missed you so much," she said, standing from the chair. "But now you're finally here, where you belong, and we can finally be the family we were always meant to be."

I held out my arms, preparing to embrace her, again, after all these years.

She turned.

I saw her face.

Or rather, the lack thereof.

Her vacant eye sockets, above the black, triangular cavity of her nose, peered at me. When she spoke, articulating syllables that shouldn't have been possible due to her lack of lips, I could see the decayed muscles and tendons that controlled her fleshless jaw moving.

"Am I still beautiful after all these years, Ryan?"

I stagger back, my mind reeling with blinding, freezing white terror, unable to think coherently.

She -- it -- took a step towards me, holding the blanketed bundle up for my inspection. A squirming, nearly indistinguishable mass of tiny bones and putrid flesh.

"Don't you want to hold our daughter, Ryan? She's missed you too."

"Stay away from me," I gasped.  I backed away from them, the grisly apparitions of my dead wife and child.

"Why? Isn't this what you've always wanted? To have us back?"

"You're dead!" I wailed.

"And so are you, Ryan," Allison replied. "You've been a living dead man for twenty-five years. You killed your own heart when we died, because you decided loving anyone else was too painful. You've been a soulless, joyless shell of a man ever since. You left us behind. In this house. The life we had together. You never allowed yourself to grieve for us. To mourn us. You never let yourself heal and move on and live again. Love again. But still we waited for you. Because we knew eventually you would come back home to us. Because we knew deep down you couldn't truly forget about us."

The smell of lavender was gone, replaced with the rank smell of decomposition. 

"Please," I whimpered, crying again. "Please stop. Can't you be like you were? Like I remember you?"

"We can't, Ryan. This is what death has reduced us to. The past can't be changed. That which is dead cannot be restored to life. But if you want to be with us...truly be with us...you can kill yourself. Get a knife from the kitchen. Cut your wrists. You'll be dead like us. And we can be together. In death. Forever."

*"NO!"* I wailed. I turned around and fled, running, fleeing once again from that house. I looked back once, certain they would be coming after me, those awful specters of my past, those tragic, ghastly parodies of Allison and the baby.

But they didn't follow me.

I ran outside to my car. I sped away, my heart racing. But before I did, I took one last look at the house. In the upstairs window I saw the figure of Allison, watching me.

\*\*\*\*\*

That was a week ago. I called in sick on Monday, telling my secretary I had the flu. I haven't left my apartment since I got back home late Friday evening. I want to believe it didn't really happen, that I experienced some kind of psychotic episode in that house and imagined the entire thing.

But I know I didn't.

Allison won't let me believe that. She keeps calling me. Even though I turned my phone off after the first call, it still keeps ringing, the number coming in on the ID as "UNKNOWN." She leaves me voicemail, begging me to come back to her and our daughter, to commit suicide.

I keep smelling her lavender perfume.

And I keeping hearing that Sinead O'Connor song playing throughout my apartment, coming from no apparent source. It's playing constantly now, gradually driving me insane.

Even in my dreams I cannot escape Allison. The first couple nights they were nightmares. But, the past few nights, the dreams have changed. Become somewhat rather pleasant. Allison and the infant are gradually appearing less and less decayed. Allison is appearing more and more beautiful and vibrant, as she was in life. She promises me we can be happy together in death, all three of us. We can be the family we were always meant to be.

And oh dear God, I'm beginning to think she may be right. I have a gun I keep in a safe in the back of my closet, for home protection. Lately I've been thinking of taking it out. And then going back to that house.

I think next time I go home, I'll be home to stay.
