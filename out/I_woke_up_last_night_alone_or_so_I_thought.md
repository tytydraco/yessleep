I don’t know why my friend told me to post this here but whatever honestly. I just need to tell this to someone, I had written out what happened one night after some personal events in my life about a couple months back. I’m currently 24 and I was just 23 when I woke up one night alone. For context, at the time my girlfriend and I were living together for a bit since she got kicked out of her previous place of residence. That night she was working the overnight shift so she was gone around 4 pm until about 7 to 8 in the morning. Anyways here’s the note I wrote about it in my phone maybe an hour after what happened, am I crazy?

…..

What the heck was that! I swear there was this massive dude in the corner of my room, he stood in front of my bedroom door. I yelled at him to identify himself, I didn’t have my pistol anywhere near me. I had gotten back from the range with a friend so I don’t know where it was, I had my rifle under my bed so I tried to quickly dive under my bed. Crap! Wait back up. 

Okay. I woke up from some strange dream I think? Yeah. I was having this weird dream being a rabbit and I could like feel this weird presence from afar, it was watching me. Finally after a few minutes I smelled this scent of like woods and wet dog so I turned my head and a wolf the size of a Cane Corso was about an inch away from chopping my head off with its massive teeth. I jolted awake and I saw this shadow in the corner of my room, my apartment isn’t very big but this man made everything look so small. 

His head scraped the ceiling and I could still smell that scent of the forest and wet dog, I didn’t realize it was raining outside till just now. He just stared at me and this is going to sound nuts I know but it was like his eyes were glowing in the dark. All I could see were two blue dots in the darkness and the silhouette reminded me of one of those old school bodybuilders, he was massive! He took a step towards me and I leaped for the rifle under my bed but as I hit the ground and spun, he grabbed my ankles and I was being pulled away. 

I was so scared, I didn’t know what was going on or who was in my apartment, I can’t figure out if he broke the lock or if he busted a window to get in. The strangest part was even though he was dragging me all I could hear was my stomach dragging across the ground but not his foot steps. Suddenly my ringtone was going off on my phone and it was like I never left my bed, I was just sitting up on my bed. That doesn’t make sense, I could see where the sheets were and they weren’t like in a way where you know you’d toss em over if you were getting up like they were against the wall like I had thrown them off me. 

I don’t know what is happening but Savanna had told me she was coming home early so I guess that’s good. I must’ve had some wicked night terror or something. I’ll probably tell Ken about it tomorrow.
