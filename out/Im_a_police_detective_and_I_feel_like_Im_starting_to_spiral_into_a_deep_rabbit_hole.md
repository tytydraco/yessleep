Hey, all. Oz is here, I've got an update on this bullshit, and I think you guys will want to hear it.

If you didn't receive the previous one, I'll summarize the case for you.

I was investigating a harassment and theft charge involving a strange man wearing a blank mask, only to discover that the situation was much more complex than I had anticipated. The man was part of a bizarre satanic cult. I witnessed them disembowel an innocent man in an alleyway, and they nearly took me too if I hadn't hidden in a porta-john and called for backup.

Despite having very little to work with, I decided to press on with the case, relying solely on the description from the photo I had taken on my phone.

The lead cultist, whom I will refer to as "Alice," appeared to be significantly more intelligent than her brutish and almost animalistic companions. Unlike the others, who exhibited extreme rage and aggression with their hissing and growling, Alice remained calm and composed.

The man, presumably the brute of this team, I shall call him "Ted", Ted was the one who helped to restrain the victim they gutted, he's dangerously strong, given how his grasp combined with the other was so strong that not even adrenaline could help the victim shake their hold.

The other male, whom I refer to as "Oscar", was the most unhinged of the group and seemingly the thinnest.

I saw him banging his head against the porta-potty I was hiding in, like he was listening to an amazing rock song.

The other 2 seemed to be twins, I shall call them "Gem" and "Ini".

They were almost indistinguishable, partly because of their blank masks, which resembled the others so closely that I’ll likely use those terms interchangeably.

So, I have a skeleton of a description regarding the cult. Great...

Now that I knew how to identify them, I kept an eye on California and waited for another occurrence.

Only this time, I was thrown for a loop when I figured out that a kidnapping had happened in Arizona.

Sure, this wasn't my usual area, but they brought me onto the case because it was clear the suspects were the same ones I'd been tracking before.

A woman claimed that the same group of five people seen in California had also been spotted in Arizona.

When she was pushing her baby's stroller in a rural, less populated part of the place, she was jumped by the criminals.

I remembered that interview, she said through quiet tears that though she had pepper spray on her, she couldn't spray both of them at once, so Ted pulled the older woman to the ground and choked her into unconsciousness.

It seems they weren't clean with the job, because she awoke later to an empty stroller, and only then could she call the police.

No signs of blood or violence apart from the initial interaction could be found, but I have doubts that the poor kid is going home safe and happy.



I told the mother that my team and I would do whatever it took to find the monsters responsible for this crime and bring them to justice. However, my professional and gentle words did little to lift her spirits. She walked out of the room almost robotically, as if the pain of losing her baby to a group of freaks was too much for her heart to bear.

There’s no relief in sight for the case or me, with my nights still as broken and restless as ever. To top it off, the chief has given me just two weeks to solve the case, or the investigation is getting shut down for good.

I asked him why, but he replied that it was an order he wasn't allowed to discuss. 

I pleaded with him, expressing my desire to know the reason, but he insisted it was classified and told me to leave his office.

So yeah, the whole damn case is on borrowed time now, so I've got that bullcrap going for me.

I've spent the past week miserable; I had nothing to pursue.

The woman did allow us to check her, but as usual, those creeps are smart enough to wear gloves, so I've got no information on that front.

I did get something from that case, though, because at some point in their escape, one of them ran through a bush. 

After all, on it, I found that the clothes they all wear belong to a specific brand.

 I contacted their company to ask if they remembered selling to these individuals. They informed me that the clothing they all wore resembled the uniforms of certain churches dyed black. 

It's information, but it ultimately adds only another sentence to the criminal profile, which makes it less significant.

I hate this case more than anything that has haunted me in my years of being a detective, but things got a whole lot more convoluted when I found myself the victim of their violence, again.

This time, it happened at home.

I was sitting in my room, drinking a certain beverage that gives you wings, doing some paperwork regarding an unrelated case, when I heard my dog howling downstairs.

Knowing that mutt wouldn't shut up on his own, I grumbled and went down the stairs, entering the kitchen, and my heart skipped a beat.

Alice was on the floor, gently petting my dog as she cut open the now-dead canine's stomach, but I wouldn't let her defile my pet, so I rushed forward and wrapped my arm around her neck.

Even though this maniac was smarter and smaller than her chatel, she still put up a fight, thrashing around and even slamming my back against the refrigerator. 

But my grip was iron and I was determined to avenge my furry friend.

But whatever came next must have been something stronger than that, because my vision blurred and my grip released as a brawny fist collided with my head.

The world span, and I managed to return to my feet just in time to see that Ted had joined the action, and enraged by the attempted strangling, Alice said the 2nd thing she had said to me since I met her.

"HERETIC!"

Those words acted like a thorny whip at their backs because Oscar revealed himself and blocked off my escape into the dining room, and Ted charged me.

But this time, I was more ready and I drew my gun, firing twice at Oscar, once at Ted, and once at Alice.

Oscar was hit in both legs, causing him to fall backward down the stairs to the basement and out of my way. Ted was shot in his knee, making him double over and abandon his charge just a short distance from me. Alice, however, was missed; she seemed to anticipate that she would be shot, so I hit the window instead as she was my last target.

Nonetheless, not wanting to do this in the small room I called my dining room, I rushed into the dining room and phoned dispatch, the perps were here, they needed to be as fast as possible.

The cops would be here in 5 minutes.

Alice whispered something into Oscar's ear and slipped away, retreating to my house and disappearing into the trees. 

Ted attacked me again, now armed with a chef's knife from my kitchen; he was stronger, but I was quicker.

When he tried to stab me, I dodged to the side, the blade collided with the wooden wall behind me, and the blade became embedded in the wall.

Ted had to stop pursuing me to yank it back out, but I had already made my aim, but it was dissuaded by  Oscar, who jumped on my back like a pouncing cat and knocked me to the floor.

If Ted had grabbed me, it would probably be all over, but I was stronger than Oscar by a margin, which allowed me to resist him and sent my forehead flying into his mask, and that headbutt stunned the psycho and allowed me to roll out of his grasp.

4 minutes.

I tried again to make a shot, but Oscar charged me again and disarmed me, not wanting them to have access to the gun, I discharged every remaining bullet into the wall nearby before he finally pulled it out of my grasp.

Seeing the gun was mostly useless now that it was empty and I had the other bullets in a safe, Oscar threw the gun to the side.

Ted got the knife out of the wall, and came at me again, it was a strong knife and Ted too was strong, so I knew I couldn't let myself get within poking range, I grabbed a chair and threw it at him.

The chair didn't seem to hurt the bulky man that much, but it did force him to stop in his tracks and lift his hands, allowing me to shove past Oscar and make my way to the bedroom.

I locked the bedroom door.

3 minutes 

The door shattered under the blows of the hulking monster that was forcing it down. 

I knew the door was old and wooden, but I didn't expect it to give way so quickly.

This is bad, there's less to fight with in my room.

I picked up two ornaments from my nightstand, a gift from my girlfriend, and threw them at both of their heads.

(Thank god she doesn't live with me yet.)

Both shots hit, and Oscar was left stunned, while Ted hissed and shrugged it off.

I jumped over my bed, dodged the slash of Ted's knife, and ran past Oscar, going to the bathroom, and hiding inside there.

2 minutes.

I was less shocked to see Ted break down this door, given how it didn't even have any lock outside of the chair I put under it.

In the only time I had to react, I picked up the broken chair leg and I hit Ted as hard as I could with it.

The already damaged piece of wood split, but Ted stumbled back enough for me to push past him and make my way down the basement stairs.

But Oscar threw something at me, I never saw what, but it made me fall down those stairs instead, I didn't hit my head too hard, but I was bruised up and dazed by the time I hit the next landing, thank fucking god the middle of the stairs had one.

I went down the last stairs and waited.

1 minute.



Ted and Oscar seemed to know this was the last time they had left to get me, so they ran down the stairs like children faced with the prospect of a sugary treat, but what baffled me was hearing them finally speak, albeit in a hoarse and guttural voice.

"You know too much, but you also know so little."

Ted hissed at me as he sprinted down the stairs multiple at a time, but as soon as I heard him speaking, I began recording on my phone in secret.

"Could you... Repeat that?"

"What is there to say? You are prey, and I am a predator."

He said coldly, but it was quite enough.

You never stop being a detective, and that moment showed the fact quite well; we would soon know a rough estimate of who he is based on his voice. Assuming he isn't wearing a voice-changer.

Ted was faster this time, before I could move, Oscar threw another object at me, and this disoriented me long enough for Ted to grab me by the throat.

Mercifully, he was too angry to shank me with a knife; he wanted to make it last.

0 minutes.

My world spun and flashed as my head collided with the wall. 



But I lasted long enough, because as soon as Police sirens could be heard, they both took off, entering the only room in the basement I knew had a window, and the police came down here fast, but by the time they did, all that could be seen was Ted's back fading into the trees.

I found my way to my feet and went back to the station to tell them.

We overlooked the recording of Ted's voice and attempted to connect it to any database, but we came up empty. 

Whoever this guy was, he and his fellow criminals were clearly off the grid. 



Whether they were born that way or managed to erase their digital footprints, I can't say for certain.

We did determine a few things: Alice is somewhat older than Ted, and Ted is around his 20s or so.

Once again, this is just a few sentences in the criminal database. 



I'm not sure what to do, but now that they've become more openly violent, we can persuade the boss to extend the case.

I'm at a dead end here, but what do you guys think? I'll probably update this when something else happens, and with how desperate those guys were to take my life, I'd say something will in a bit.
