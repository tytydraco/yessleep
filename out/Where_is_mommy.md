The completely dark road, endlessly stretched in front of my car. Only barely lit up by the front facing lights. I’ve never been the type of guy to get scared easily by the type of environment I was inside of. But something about the tight and eerie atmosphere made me uncomfortable. The trees stood stately on each side of the road, bending over my car as I slowly made my way through the tough snowstorm. The terrain itself made it extremely tough to navigate and find my way through the narrow road. 

I live far away from any civilization. I don’t have social anxiety or anything, I just prefer not being around people. The nearest grocery store or gas station, is around 6 miles away from where I live. And in my 13 whole years of being that far away from civilization, I’ve almost never encountered a human being on this particular road, so seeing any form of human life here is extremely abnormal. 

After approximetly 15 minutes of trying to navigate trough the tough conditions and the vast amount of snow, I've came pretty close to my final destination. When i suddenly saw smething. My heart dropped. I slammed on the breaks as hard as I could’ve possibly done. Only about 2 meters at most away from my truck, sat a little girl, playing with some kind of toy on the road. She looked to be around 2-4 years old. 

Without a second thought, I opened the car door and ran towards the girl to see if she was okay. I sat down beside her and softly put my hand on her shoulder, she was cold, ice cold. I asked if she were okay, I wasn’t immediately met with a response. 

But after what felt like an eternity, she slowly turned her head around and I was met by her eyes, dangling out of her skull, with the support of only a couple thin blood vessels. I was paralysed. I couldn’t move a muscle. I managed to slowly look down, and a large mouth, the size of a fully grown adult, opened up for me. 

She leaned towards me, and whispered “where is mommy?”. She started smiling hysterically and absurd amounts of what looked like black blood, gushed down her mouth. Without a second thought, I ran back to my car and turned on the engine. When I looked up, I realized that... She was gone. Not a single trail of blood, or any kind of sign that could indicate that a human being was just there. Or maybe not a human being….

I stepped on the gas pedal as hard as I could and got out of there as quickly as possible. I looked behind me and was to scared to keep my eyes on the road. As soon as I looked back I realized that I needed to hard turn left. I didn’t have enough time to react, so naturally, I crashed into a tree on the right side of the road.

“Thank you, Mr.Williams.”  
“We will do everything in our power to try to find out what happened to you that night.”  
“Thank you sir.”  
“You’re free to leave.”

(End of police interrogation)

Mr.Willams was later found lifeless in his apartment.
