*Dispatcher #3 received a call at approximately 11:47 PM, Francene Foster (Female, 34 years old) reported that her husband had been missing since the morning after the June 8 incident. She noted that it had been well over the 48-hour requirement before reporting a missing person. Sheriff James Alder and Deputy Aaron silver conducted a search 5 miles around the Foster residence which was covered in forestry. During this time Leo Foster had returned home safe and sound albeit covered in a black substance. He claimed to be fine and that it was just from his work at the factory. When questioning him on his location he was very hesitant to answer, dodging questions. Deputy Silver asked Mr. Foster if he had seen the suspect seen a few nights before, to which Mr. Foster replied by turning aggressive and demanding both officers leave his house immediately.*

*Dispatcher #2 received a call at approximately 2:11 AM, Jared Foster (Male, 13 years old) reported that the suspect had tried to talk to him, before retreating once again into the woods when Jared had threatened to phone the police. Sheriff James Alder immediately dispatched to the Foster residence, where he questioned Jared Foster. The following interview was recorded through Sheriff Alders radio which was active at the time:*

Sheriff Alder: This has been quite a ride the past week and a half for you, hasn't it? A man breaks in, your pa goes missing, and on top of that the suspect came back.

Jared Foster: It hasn't been right. An hour ago, before the man had left, he showed me something, something that I don't think dad should hear about.

Sheriff Alder: What did he show you son?

Jared Foster: He showed his face, he pulled off his hoodie, he really was.... he really was my uncle, at least he looked like it.

Sheriff Alder: Son I understand your uncle was a big role model in your life, but we identified his body in the woods that day, he couldn't have survived.

Jared Foster: But that's not all! He also told me that dad wasn't right, that he wasn't...

Sheriff Alder: Son? What is it? Spit it -

*The interview ended here when a loud thumping sound followed by a scream was heard over Sheriff Alders radio. Sheriff Alder has returned to the department but has since acted distant and has not followed up on what was heard on his radio.*

*At approximately 4:53 PM a man calling himself Carl Foster had arrived at the department. Deputy Aaron Silver confronted the man who was very aggressive and took him to a room to question him. He admitted to being the suspect who had broken into the Foster residence, stating that he really is Carl Foster. The following interview was recorded by the audio in the room's camera:*

Deputy Silver: You sick son of a bitch, you pretend to be a man's dead brother, break into his family's home, attempt to assault his only child, then you come here and act like you didn't just commit several crimes?!

Carl Foster: You don't get it! That wasn't me who died that fucking day! It wasn't me goddamn it! It was a fucking imposter! Why do you think no blood was found at the scene of the crime? There was only that black substance that pumps through their dead corpses.

Deputy Silver: Son, am I going to have to add substance abuse to your charges?

Carl Foster: Look Deputy, all due respect, I called the factory my brother works at, they hadn't seen him since he left his shift on June 7. He hasn't shown up to work, that thing... that FUCKING THING at my brother's house, sleeping with my brother's wife is not my goddamn brother! That thing killed him, just like the thing that looked like me was going to kill me, you don't understand, we got to stop this!

Deputy Silver: \*Laughs\* That is one hell of a story, and by God if you weren't convincing for a short while there.

Carl Foster: No... no... you're one of them... you're fucking one of -

*The interview ended here when screaming was picked up by the camera's audio followed by loud banging sounds. The camera's video footage is not available as it was deleted by the system by Sheriff Alder shortly after it was recorded.*

*What the fuck happened to this town* I mutter to myself; my two brothers don't contact me in a month and now I read... whatever the fuck this is. I think I got to visit the town's department then the house, I need to find out what really happened there. If I don't access my phone in the next few hours this audio recording and case files will be sent straight to headquarters. Wish me luck.
