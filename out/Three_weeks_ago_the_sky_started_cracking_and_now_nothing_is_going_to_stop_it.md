I live in a small town in Massachusetts. Greystone is an apt name—it wears the same color 360 days a year: a dark, oppressive gray. I moved here with my son James five years ago. He was too young to understand what we were running from. What his father became when he drank. And he never will.

Greystone is quiet. The kind of place where neighbors keep to themselves, businesses huddle behind rain-streaked windows, and the roads seem more traveled by ghosts than by people. If not for the slow crawl of cars over our rocky colonial streets, I might believe I was the only one left.

I didn’t even notice the crack at first.

That afternoon had been as beautiful as it gets here—the cloud cover had thinned just enough for us to almost see the sun. James was playing in the yard, his laughter cutting through the silence of the street. I let the sound wash over me as I stood at the sink, scrubbing dishes and enjoying the rare light.

Then—nothing.

No rustling in the bushes. No battle cries from imaginary soldiers. Just silence.

I turned off the faucet, my hands frozen in the soapy water. “James?” I called, trying to keep the creeping panic from my voice. I leaned over the sink, peering out the window.

He stood motionless in the yard, his Nerf football forgotten at his feet, staring at the horizon.

I rushed outside, my heart hammering. James was never this still, never this quiet. I skidded to my knees in front of him.

“James? Honey, what’s wrong? Say something.”

His eyes were distant, his breath slow. Then, without looking at me, he raised one small hand and pointed.

“Someone hurt the sky.”

I swallowed. “What?”

“The sky,” he said, his voice light and dreamlike. “Something’s hurting it. It’s bleeding.”

I turned, following the line of his finger. I expected the same dull, endless gray I had seen every day for five years. But instead, I saw it.

A thin, jagged wound in the sky. A hairline fracture slashed through the clouds, glowing with a faint, reddish-orange light.

For a moment, I just stared, my mind scrambling for something—anything—to explain it.

“What do you think did it, Mom?” James asked, voice brimming with excitement. “Was it a big knight? With, like, a humongous sword!?” He swung an imaginary blade through the air, already lost in his own story.

I forced a smile, nudging him gently toward the house. “No, sweetheart. It’s probably just… a trick of the light. A heat shimmer, maybe.”

I didn’t even trust my own words.

That night, after tucking James into bed and listening to his excited ramblings about giant space knights and laser swords, I sat alone in the living room, a half-empty glass of wine in my hand.

I told myself not to look. That by now, the "heat shimmer" would be gone. That in the morning, I’d wake up to the same old sky, unbroken and dull.

But the unease gnawed at me, slow and insistent.

I crossed the room and pulled back the curtain.

The crack was still there.

And in the dark, it was even clearer. The glow was deeper now, pulsing—slow and rhythmic, like something breathing. Like something alive.



…

The crack only got worse after that first day.

At first, people assumed it was far off in the distance, some atmospheric anomaly beyond our reach. But as it widened, its red glow began to stain the rooftops of our town. The houses closest to it were bathed in its eerie light, their windows flickering like they were reflecting something that wasn’t entirely in our world.

And then, people started hearing things.

“It’s like something far above me is tapping on my roof,” my friend Stacy murmured, dark circles etched beneath her eyes. Her family lived directly under the crack.

“What… what do you mean?” I asked.

“I don’t know. It’s not loud. Just this… pattern. A slow, rhythmic beat. Like a heartbeat.”

But that wasn’t the only thing wrong.

She told me that every time she stepped inside her house, she felt sick.

“It’s like being dead drunk,” she said, rubbing her temples. “Like the floor isn’t where I left it. I can’t focus. I’m constantly on edge, like I’m about to throw up.”

“Oh, God, Stacy… I’m so sorry. That must be awful for the kids.”

“It hasn’t been fun,” she admitted, “but the strangest thing is… we’re all feeling the same way. Even the dreams.”

“Dreams?” I asked, unsettled. “What kind of dreams?”

She hesitated, staring at the crack’s glow in the distance.

“Every night, we feel like we’re being lifted. Like we’re floating out of bed, carried gently into the sky… like a fish on a hook.”

It wasn’t just her family.

Birds stopped flying toward the crack. Dog walkers changed their routes after their pets began thrashing, trying to escape their leashes whenever they got too close. The world around us *knew* something was wrong. The only ones blind to its danger were us.

Until the disappearances began.

Hikers and travelers started vanishing near the horizon. Their campsites were found exactly as they had left them—food still packed away, fires reduced to embers, bags untouched. The only thing out of place was a long smear of something dark red, stretching toward the crack like something had *dragged* them inside.

We stopped the search parties after the seventh one never came back.

And then, someone tried to look inside.

A local news station decided it would be a great idea to broadcast a live attempt. A drone enthusiast—grinning ear to ear at the chance to be on TV—agreed to fly his machine directly into the crack. He wore VR goggles, his hands steady on the controls as the drone buzzed forward, its camera relaying the feed to the live broadcast.

The moment it crossed the threshold, he started convulsing.

I heard the scream from inside my house.

By the time paramedics arrived, he was blind. He never saw anything again for the rest of his short life.

The footage recovered from the drone was nearly all static, washed in a blinding, crimson light.

All except for a single, clear frame.

An eye.

Colossal. Vast beyond comprehension, its iris a deep, writhing black, its pupil contracting as if adjusting to the drone’s presence.

It dwarfed the camera by hundreds of times.

And it was watching.

…

In just two weeks, Greystone had become unrecognizable.

The land warped. The buildings buckled under the red glow, their frames creaking as they were lifted inches from their foundations, as if something unseen was trying to pull them away. The roads, already rough, had become treacherous—jagged rocks jutting higher, shifting beneath our feet. Everything in town tilted slightly toward the crack, like the entire world was leaning into it.

Stacy’s family was falling apart.

It wasn’t just their house—the crack had begun affecting *them*.

I found her one night, miles from home. She was standing in front of my door at 2 a.m., barefoot, shivering in the glow of the horizon. She had sleepwalked three miles through the twisting streets. When she woke up on my couch, I told her that much.

I didn’t tell her what I had seen before she woke.

How, for a moment, her veins pulsed with the same dull red light as the crack. How, when she blinked in her sleep, I could have sworn her eyes flickered like LED bulbs, the glow struggling to stay contained.

Then, the sky bled.

At first, it was just a drizzle on the roof. Rain wasn’t uncommon here, so it didn’t set off any alarms. Not until the screaming started.

One voice, then two. Somewhere in the distance, long, ragged wails of pain—drawn out impossibly long, as if the breath never ran out. Then five. Ten. A *chorus* of agony.

I rushed to the window.

Crimson droplets pattered against the glass.

The news blared in the background, scrambling to rationalize it. An *atmospheric anomaly*. A freak weather event. But no amount of false reassurance could wash away the broadcast’s final warning:

**“Stay inside if you value your life.”**

I took a step back. I wasn’t going anywhere near that *thing* falling from the sky. Not when I had already seen what it did to the pavement—how the sidewalks *sank* under its weight. How the neighbors who had been caught in the open were shrieking, clutching their faces as steam rose from their skin.

Then my stomach dropped.

James.

I had let him outside that morning. It had been weeks since he’d played beyond the walls of our house, weeks of shutting out the red glow, of pretending we still lived in a world where children *could* play. But that day, the light had dimmed, if only slightly. And I had convinced myself that maybe, *just maybe*, it was safe enough for him to be a kid again.

I should have known better.

I should have never trusted the world with my son.

I ran to the front door, praying—**God, please let him be waiting there. Please, please let him be smart enough to stay put.**

He *was* waiting.

I swung the door open.

What greeted me was no longer my James.

Just the remnants of what the sky had turned him into.

I wanted to reach for him, to pull him inside, to whisper that everything could be fixed. But the way his translucent skin sagged around his face, barely clinging to the softening skull beneath. The way his legs had melted into a quivering mass of flesh below his sinking torso.

I knew.

It was too late for my boy.

I will never forget the way his fused fingers stretched toward me. The way his torn, melting vocal cords forced out one final insult to my ever-growing injury.

**“Help me… Mom.”**

**…**

I am writing this because I heard a sound.

Sleep hasn’t come for me in the week since I lost James. Night after night, I see his body dissolving in the rain, washing away in crimson rivulets, vanishing before I can reach him. Even in sleep, the nightmare doesn’t let me forget. I started locking my bedroom door—not to keep anything *out*, but to keep myself from running blindly into the street, chasing after a ghost.

Tonight, as I lay there, forcing my eyes open, refusing to slip back into that waking torture, I heard it.

**Thump.**

A slow, rhythmic beating.

Like Stacy said, all those weeks ago.

The crack is no longer just a fracture in the sky. It has spread so far, so wide, that the dark of night no longer exists. The soft glow of the moon is gone, swallowed by an endless, seething red. The thing that stole my son has taken the sky itself.

I rose to my feet. My laptop sat on my desk, next to my draped window. As I pulled back the curtain, my fingers trembled.

The crack loomed directly over my house now.

Even as I type, I can *feel* it pulling at the foundation. A silent, invisible hunger, slowly lifting my home—my last refuge—toward the thing waiting on the other side. The dull, wet *thump* pounds in my skull, in my bones, rattling through the walls like a second heartbeat.

I am bathed in the red light that devoured my town, my home, my son.

And there is nothing I can do to stop it from taking me next.

Do not come to Greystone.

If it even still exists.

Something has infested us—an endless, starving god. Its crimson rain has soaked into the earth, its glow reminds us of its presence every second of every day.

The sky is open.

Something is coming through.

And its eye is staring straight at me.
