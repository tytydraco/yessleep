Do you remember or go to real churches?

Let me preface this by saying I haven’t lived in a city for too long. I used to live in a small village in norther Quebec until I was 18 and was sent to live through my first pilgrimage. The village was small and rustic. We did have electricity and internet, but honestly, power went out all the time and there were so many sites blocked that I might has well have had no internet at all.

I was never really religious, or at least I thought I thought I wasn’t, but the city stresses me, scares me, so I’ve started praying again. I say city but I haven’t been to Montreal yet, my dreams won’t tell me to go there yet. I’ve moved from town to town, each of them bigger than the last one.

With that being said, here is why I’m writing this post. Praying on your own can only get you so far, so searched the web for a catholic church nearby. I arrived there and I was terrified. It’s like someone found a notebook detailing all the ways to anger Gor and build an effigy to it. A man in robes was standing at the altar, speaking a sermon in English, with none of the proper equipment. I could hear everyone pray (again, in English) without drawing blood and their last prayers ended without a new martyr.

Now I know what you’re all about to say. I’ve probably stumbled into a church of some heathen new wave cult or something like that. But looking at the stained glass and the statue, I could almost recognize some of the deities depicted. I’m a very tolerant person, Gor knows I had to become one when I left the village, but this is defacement, disrespectful and more importantly, blasphemous.

I talked to the priest (that’s what he calls himself) and he tried to comfort me, or rather gaslight me into thinking this was all normal and every catholic church was more or less like that. I didn’t want to argue about it. He seemed nice enough and I knew that if we kept talking heresy, something bad would happen to him. 

I haven’t been able to sleep since then. I tried praying again, but rats only do so much. If I want to help, to really help, I’m going to need bigger donations. I’m scared to ask help from the elders too. They warned me many times that I had stretched my pilgrimage for too long, that I was going to do something irreversible sooner or later. I’m afraid I’ll bring his wrath back home.

I’ve already started to see signs. The sliding door to my balcony is covered in a sheet of locust, scratching at the window day and night. I can’t go anywhere without birds plummeting to their deaths, right at my feet. The dreams are now empty of kindness.

So, I’m asking again. Do any of you remember real churches? Because these people need help, and I don’t think I have the strength to render all of this flesh alone.
