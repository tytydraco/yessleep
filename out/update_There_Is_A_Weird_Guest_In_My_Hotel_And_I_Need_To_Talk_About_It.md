[\[FIRST PART\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ia0egw/there_is_a_weird_guest_in_my_hotel_and_i_need_to/)

Hi guys, I just wanted to start this post off by saying thank you for the comments on the last one. I really thought I might have been over exaggerating how weird this guy was. I told my sister about it yesterday as well once she got home and she didn’t think it should have freaked me out as much as it did. She said, “if the worst that happened was a bad phone call, then I think your day went pretty fine OP.” But reading all of your responses being equally weirded out by the guy made me feel a bit less crazy. I mean, today has been... a day. Kind of starting to feel crazy again, but you know, I’ll get into it.

As for if my manager ever updated me on anything the guy did yesterday… No? I mean she did text me about him today, but I’ll talk about that in a second. So I guess after I checked him into his room, he just stayed there all day. 

We have a passdown system here, so basically we have a log where we put all our notes for the day, including things like strange behaviors from guests. Usually it looks something like this:

**\[ROOM NUMBER\] - guest had issues using the shower. Work order entered.** 

Or:

**Cops were called on lady in lobby, lady did not have a reservation and refused to leave. She is trespassed, if she shows up again, call cops. \[DESCRIPTION OF GUEST\].**

I think you get the idea. They are usually pretty short and sweet. There really isn’t a need to gum it up with information that doesn’t really matter. I was reading the passdowns from our overnight girl this morning though and it was a bit longer than her usual entries. I copied it here for you guys (a bit redacted, sorry, privacy policy stuff):

**\[ROOM NUMBER\] - Mr. \[GUEST LAST NAME\] was in the lobby for a while last night. I asked if he needed help for anything but he said he was fine. I asked for his room number to make sure he was staying with us (he is). Called \[SECURITY GUARDS NAME\] and asked him to stand up at the desk with me. Mr. \[GUEST LAST NAME\] went back to his room once \[SECURITY GUARD\] got here. Got a call from his room too, but I think his phone is broken. (\[OP\], can you have \[MAINTENANCE\] check it out in the morning?).** 

I read it after she clocked out so I wasn’t able to ask her more about the phone thing, like if she felt the weird breathing thing that I did yesterday. 

There weren’t any other notes about him in our passdowns, but one of my housekeeping girls today did text me saying that when she went to give him room service he was really weird. The thing about that is, the room has to be vacated for someone to do housekeeping. It's a safety policy thing. It’s been a while since I’ve read it, but basically it’s for the safety of our housekeepers. Well, Mr. Weird was in the room while she was cleaning. 

I’ll copy our texts here so you can see what she had to deal with. (Also, sorry but another note here. She doesn’t speak English, and I don’t speak Spanish, so our texts back and forth can read a little weird. We are just doing rounds of google translate to the other person's language and it doesn’t always go well.)

\[Housekeeper\] - Our guest in \[ROOM NUMBER\] is strange.

\[Me\]                 - Yes! I noticed yesterday at check in! How did he behave with you?

\[Housekeeper\] - He is standing in the room as I cleaned. He watched me as I cleaned.

\[Me\]                 - Ew! I’m so sorry! \[long apology about the situation\] He didn’t do anything else 

though? Just looked?

\[Housekeeper\] - He only looked as I cleaned. 

\[Me\]                 - I’m so sorry. 

\[Housekeeper\] - It is okay! I won’t enter that room again.

Then a bit of time passed, maybe 5 minutes?

\[Housekeeper\] - Can I tell you something about \[ROOM NUMBER\]? 

\[Me\]                 - Yes

\[Housekeeper\] - I left his room and I hear him talking. He sounds behind me. 

\[Me\]                 - He sounds like he is standing behind you?

\[Housekeeper\] - yes

\[Me\]                 - Do not go near his room again. 

\[Housekeeper\] - ok

I’m pretty sure she got an early lunch, and my housekeeping manager came down to talk to me about it. I told her what I knew, which isn’t a lot. That, apparently, he had requested housekeeping (but I really can’t find any notes about this literally anywhere), she had gone to the room and entered, then texted me that he was in the room when she was cleaning. I want to double down that the housekeeper that went in is 100% not the type to do that. All the housekeepers know not to go in the room if someone is in there, but her especially. So now I’m thinking, like, what did he say or do to get her in the room? 

The housekeeping manager said something about going up to tell him we would not be cleaning the room if he was in it, but he’s set to check out tomorrow so it shouldn’t be a big deal. I just told her we shouldn’t send anyone up to that room alone, but she thinks I’m being a bit dramatic about it. But I never got a message from her saying she went up there to tell him anything so maybe she decided against it. 

So about my manager's text. She sent it to me like halfway through my shift (it was actually during my lunch break), and it’s not all that weird on its own but, you know. In addition to everything else, it's pretty weird. She texted me and asked if he’d called the desk again. And obviously I was confused because she didn’t have anything in her notes about him being weird and calling the desk. I’ll copy these messages as well for you:

\[Manager\] - Did \[ROOM NUMBER\] call the desk again today?

\[Me\]          - Not yet. Why?

\[Manager\] - He kept calling last night, and I know he called during \[OVERNIGHT GIRL\]’s shift 

too. 

\[Me\]          - Oh, well he hasn’t called again. 

\[Me\]          - Did he say anything weird?

\[Manager\] - On the phone?

\[Me\]          - Yeah

\[Manager\] - No, I think the phone in that room is broken.

\[Me\]          - Did he say anything on the phone?

\[Manager\] - No, I think it’s the phone in that room. We just need to go in and change it. I texted 

\[MAINTENANCE\] about it and he said he would check it out. 

\[Me\]          - I’m going to tell him not to enter the room if the guest is in there. \[GUEST NAME\] 

really creeped me out last night, and \[HOUSEKEEPER\] too this morning. 

\[Manager\] - Just let me know if \[MAINTENANCE\] can fix the phone when he’s done. Text me if 

anything weird happens. 

I mean guys, I don’t know but this phone thing is really bothering me. Like really really bothering me because I checked the call logs and he called the front desk like 32 times. It looked like twice an hour every hour from around 3pm ish till 6am ish. That is crazy right?? I’m not crazy for thinking that's crazy? No one tried to call back and tell him to stop? No one went up to the room to tell him to stop? Because there is no way that 32 times is an issue with the phone. I mean unless some techy person on here can tell me some super obscure way that causes phones to call one specific number over and over again like that. I don’t know, I feel like it's really weird. 

Anyway, this is the most exciting part. I’m sorry it took so long, these other things were just a bit too weird to not include them. I saw him again. 

So I was going back to the kitchen to refill the coffee, and it was like almost the end of my shift so I was sort of losing hope that I was going to see him today. So I fill the little coffee container, and walk back up to the desk, and turn the corner. Who do I see? Mr. Weird standing right in front of the coffee station.

He wasn’t making coffee or anything, just looking at it. So I walked up beside him and tried to talk to him. Kind of went something like this. 

“Hello Mr. \[LAST NAME\], do you mind moving over just a bit so I can set down some fresh coffee for you?”

“Fresh?” Which is the first question I’ve heard him ask. Yesterday when he came to make the reservation to begin with he just said ‘I need a room’ or something like that. I don’t know, maybe I’m reading into it too much. 

“Yes Mr. \[LAST NAME\]. I just roasted a new pot of coffee, so I just went to the back to refill it here.”

And this whole time I was trying to like, observe him without making it obvious. A couple of comments yesterday made me think that I should like, maybe try to see if there is something off about him, looks wise. 

So another baby interlude here, when you are behind the desk and helping someone out, it's hard to fully realize the scope of how tall someone is. There's just space between you, so it makes a height difference seem less intense. I don’t know the science or psychology behind it, just know that's how it feels.

So I walk up to the guy, try to get him to scooch over while also trying to see if he looks ‘off’ somehow, and suddenly I notice that he’s like Really Tall. I’m not that short either. I mean, I’m only 5’8 but this guy is dwarfing me. Not like, “he’s 6ft omg!” but like, “This is freakishly tall and I have no idea how I didn’t notice yesterday” kind of tall. I don’t think it helps that he was standing so straight, like he had a rod up his back or something. It was freaky. 

And then, he looked at me, which he was not doing before and I fucking felt his eyes in my skin again. I’m sorry, I tried to keep cursing out of the post, mostly because it’s not really necessary but oh my god. I swear, I could feel his eyes in my skin. 

I… I really don’t know what else to say. I don’t know how to describe it. He was just… Looking At Me. Staring at me. I really don’t even have words close enough for how it felt when he looked at me. I felt so bad, did my housekeeper feel like this? Like, guys, did I somehow, inadvertently, send my poor housekeeper into this fucking guy’s room???? Because this staring is just… it feels awful. I feel awful. Like sick or something I don’t know. Like when you are so anxious you start to feel sick, even if nothing is really happening. That’s kind of, a little bit like what being watched by this guy felt like. Sort of. 

The really unfortunate thing is that his… fucking staring, god christ it was awful, sort of distracted me from trying to notice much else about him. I know I had mentioned in one comment that I would try to see if he looked as normal as I remember him and I really couldn’t tell you. I kind of felt… frozen. Or maybe more, paused? Like I couldn’t get myself to move. I don’t know. It’s really hard to describe. Maybe it’s just fight or flight (or freeze). 

Anyway, he stopped looking at me eventually. I set up the coffee for him, and like, apologized for staring (I kind of was staring at him), then went to hide in the back office. 

Saying I was recovering from him staring at me sounds a little stupid, but hey that's what I was doing. So I sat in the back and watched on the camera monitor. I’ll do that sometimes if I’m really not in the mood to be at the desk or if it's really slow. 

Well anyway, there he was on the camera. Standing in front of the coffee station, the funny thing is, he did not look as tall as he felt. He looked tall but not freakishly tall. Maybe my anxiety was warping the height in my brain or something. 

There really isn’t much more to tell you from there that isn’t the same as yesterday. I was looking at the camera, there was some camera fuzz, I looked under the desk to try and see if something wasn’t plugged in properly, and by the time I looked up, the guy was gone. The coffee station was messed up too. Like, coffee all over the table, coffee cups half filled, sugar packets kind of, everywhere. A huge mess that I had to clean in the last like, 30 minutes of my shift. So that’s cool. 

I looked back in the camera recordings again for when he was in the lobby before I hid in the back. It sort of just looked like we were having a staring contest when he was looking at me. He didn’t… move or anything. I kinda didn’t either. Looking at it from that perspective kind of tripped me out, I don’t know. On the camera it sort of looks pretty normal. Apart from having a staring contest. 

I didn’t tell my manager about it, I just wanted to get home and type this all up so I can get it off my chest. I also told the agent following me to text me if literally anything weird happened with him. Anything at all. Hopefully he doesn’t freak her out. 

Also a couple of notes for some of the comments. 

1. The only thing reported missing was a set of car keys that ended up being found later in the guest's room. I also didn’t notice anything missing from the desk, and housekeeping didn’t mention anything missing either. 
2. The only other ‘disappearing act’ situation that happened with him today (so far) was him being in the lobby and then being gone, but that could have been the camera malfunctioning, and also I was away from the desk to fill the coffee containers so he could have just walked up like normal.
3. I haven’t rewatched the ‘men in black’ episode of unsolved mysteries/buzzfeed unsolved yet. Felt like just coming home, changing into pajamas, and watching tiktoks in bed for a bit. 

Again, if any other front desk agents or anyone has dealt with this guy or someone like him, some help or advice would be really appreciated. He should be checking out tomorrow so I will update you if anything happens at that time. Hopefully not though.
