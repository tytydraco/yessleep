When you propose to the (hopefully) love of your life, you *really* need to be sure that they’ll say Yes. It’s not supposed to be a gamble, and with Sofia it never had been. That’s why my heart dropped when she just looked at me and said “Huh?”



A few thoughts split into a few more and then folded on themselves, spiraling into pure dread. I’d never been unsure whether I wanted to marry her, nor if she wanted to marry me. We’d talked about it a thousand times, and the trip to Sicily was - at least to me - an obvious sign the question might be coming. 



I repeated the question, and for a moment she just stared at me. I think I lost my heartbeat for a second there. Then, like sunshine peeking through the clouds, her face lit up. She started to laugh and laugh, and soon she was running out of breath. The moment was so uncomfortable that I began to laugh with her, hoping that whatever was so funny wasn’t going to be something that would destroy my life. Take her away. Make me look like an idiot.



After what felt like an eternity - but was probably closer to thirty seconds - she looked at me with soft eyes, her head cocked sweetly against the calm ocean spreading out behind her. 



I realized I was still down on bended knee, holding the ring between my fingers. Asking the question for a third time felt silly, so I went with “What’s so funny?” 



“Oh, it’s nothing,” she said with a smile, “just that I was watching a seagull have diarrhea while it was eating french fries on the beach as you asked me to marry you.”



“So, will you?”



“Yes.”



\-\*-



That’s the memory that kept playing in my head during her funeral. Just an agonizing loop of the fright, the humor, and the pure and astounding love that I went through during those few minutes. In my mind, it was all that was left of her. Nothing else came up. 



We had a good ten years together. We'd planned for many decades more. 



Grief is a cruel thing. For the next year, that same loop kept playing in my head. When I cleaned out her stuff. When I visited her parents. When I cried myself to sleep, wishing for just one more day. One more fresh memory to add to the catalogue. It was all tainted by that five-minute-memory.



Perhaps I’d conditioned myself to relive that moment each time I thought of her, the link becoming stronger each time I did so. Soon I began to wonder how much the memory had deviated from reality during this time. Was she wearing white or green shoes that day? Was it actually sunny, or perhaps overcast? Did the seagull thing even really happen, or is that from some other memory stored next to this one, bleeding over from the spot next to it?



Sleep was difficult, and it was taking its toll on me. I couldn’t concentrate on anything, but I was lucky enough to finally get a few months off work to get my mental state in a better shape. I saw a therapist once a week, which helped for the exact amount of the sixty minutes we spent talking. Once I closed her office door, I fell back into the darkness, my tired mind looping through that same memory, my life held together only by the daily rituals I’d accumulated in the past ten years: make the bed, brush your teeth, eat lunch, eat dinner, brush your teeth, go to sleep. 



I came to the conclusion that I needed some type of closure. To stop my mind from running these destructive loops. To focus on something other than the pain. 



Incidentally, I’d come across lucid dreaming on social media around that time. At first I thought it was quite stupid, since most of the content centered around “astral planes,” “out-of-body projections” and the like. That was until I formed an idea: what if I could lucid dream Sofia? I could talk to her again. Form new memories of her. Perhaps even find something in my subconscious to soothe the pain. 



I decided to give it a try. 



The following night I laid on the bed and did breathing exercises to calm my nervous system down - inhaling for one… two… three… four…



And exhaling for seven slow seconds.



It was difficult to keep my mind from wandering, and slowly time began to lose all sense. I began to feel my limbs tingling, falling asleep. But my mind was sharp, and with my eyes closed, I began to imagine a rope hanging from the ceiling. It was thick and coarse, seemingly providing excellent grip, and I knew I could climb it with ease. 



Once the rope had cemented itself as something almost as real as everything else, I took it into my hands.



*And I could actually feel it.* 



The sensation was odd and magical. I could feel my physical body laying down, my limbs unresponsive and limp, yet an *idea* of my own body was beginning to climb up the rope, leaving the sleeping sack of flesh behind. It hurt my head a bit to see and feel myself being in two places simultaneously, but a wave of comfort and euphoria washed over me as I ascended the rope towards the ceiling. 



I pulled myself closer and closer, and everything began turning blurry. I was falling asleep while being aware of the act itself. It was odd and scary and awesome all at the same time.



A hurricane of colors and dark lines wooshed by me, and the next thing I saw was my own body, peacefully snoring away. I was floating above it like a ghost. 



The excitement almost overpowered the dream, so I had to calm myself down so I wouldn’t immediately wake up. To achieve this, I decided to fly around a bit - because of course the first thing you do in a lucid dream is to fly - until I’d come up with a plan. 



I headed out into the street, and the weather was warm with a decent overcast. It seemed like the air had no effect on me: no drag, no coolness, no scent. I flew around the neighborhood simply exploring, fascinated by the experience. But weirdly enough, flying around lost its charm quite quickly. Perhaps it was too easy in my dreamstate, and knowing that I could manipulate the dream as I wished made it less novel. 



The neighborhood was gray and quiet. Nobody was around. My mind got too used to the dream, and the memory of my proposal to Sofia began to play in my head again. I tried to shoo it away, but it became stronger and stronger and more vivid in every aspect, until it began to shift my perception of the dreamworld itself. The ground began to shake, and the sun came out with a hot fizz. Sand poured in from the sky to form a beach, and luscious waves of sky-blue water rose up from somewhere deep within the earth to form an ocean stretching to the horizon. The buildings slowly collapsed into clumps of wood that grew into lemon trees. The dream was being taken over, and I could do nothing but watch it happen as my heart shrunk into a shrivelled, scared fist of flesh and blood.



Something snapped, and I began to fall, unable to control myself. I thought I was going to die, but when I hit the ground, it was as if I’d already been there. 



There, on one knee, with Sofia looking at a seagull shitting itself and eating french fries



The words came out of my mouth like the whole thing was a play, the line carefully rehearsed down to the breaths before and after: “Sofia, will you marry me?”



She turned to look at me with wide, dead eyes. The memory was different now, I could feel it. I tried to think about what I should do, but my mind refused to form thoughts. I realized I was sobbing, and I could taste the salty tears in my mouth, but they would evaporate from my mouth without swallowing.



Sofia kept staring at me, not saying a word. I couldn’t form words, and a deep despair took me over. This was worse than the memory. This was wrong. Why had I decided to do this? *Had* I decided to do this?



“What are you doing here?” she said, breaking the silence. 



“I… I don’t know,” I said. 



“Why have you come here? You shouldn’t be here,” Sofia replied, her voice trying to stay firm as it quivered. 



“I just wanted to see you again,” I said, the words blurting out without thought.



“You really shouldn’t have come here,” she said, turning to face the ocean.



“I *wanted* to come here, I think,” I said. “I’m here to… to fix things. I miss you so much, and I can’t live like this anymore. This memory keeps playing in my head, and it hurts so much. I had to do something.”



“Andrew, you need to listen to me,” she said, her voice rock-hard. “I gave that to you. But you shouldn’t have come here.”



“What?” I said.



“I gave you the memory. I gave you the loop. I am within it, and as long as you had it, I could be with you. But now you’re here, and I don’t know what’s going to happen. I wanted you to be happy. I’m so, so sorry.”



“I don’t understand.”



“Andrew, I ––”



The truck came from nowhere, like it had blipped into existence right then and there. It hit Sofia from her blind side, first bumping her skull free from the tendons on her neck, and then dragged her body across the sand, leaving a trail of blood and viscera along its way. 



The shock was just like it had been on that day, a numbing fire breathing fire over the world, choking me just enough to still keep me conscious. The light had been green, but the truck driver had been drunk. It was a matter of inches that I hadn’t been under that truck as well. A matter of seconds and dumb luck that she had. 



The world began to move away from me, or I from it. The truck and Sofia’s corpse and the lemon trees of Sicily were sucked into the horizon until they were just a black dot within a canvas of light. Then the black dot began to grow and grow, spreading itself into a sky of darkness that took over the world.



I woke up staring at the dark ceiling above me. 



\-\*-



The memory of my proposal is gone now. I can describe it with vivid detail, yet I can’t see it. I can’t picture it. I can’t feel it. It’s no longer mine, just a phantom circling the circuitry of my mind.



But the loop continues, replaced now by the death of my Sofia. Each and every day it plays in my head, and I can see and feel each and every injury she suffered, and all the flashing thoughts that she felt as the last remnants of her soul were ripped from this world. Sometimes I can see her torn body on the street, superimposed over the asphalt. 



I was an idiot for trying to find something to cure grief. It can't be cured, and now something has changed within me and outside of me. Something happened to her in that dream, I'm sure of it. Something happened between *us*.

And that I regret. But perhaps there's still a way to fix this. To find my way back and reverse what I have done. To find that sweet memory once again, wherein we can both still be together under the scorching sun of Sicily.
