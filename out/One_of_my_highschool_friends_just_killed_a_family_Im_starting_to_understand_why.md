———

I didn’t plan on posting again so soon, but I don’t know how much longer I can hold this inside. Something has changed since my last entry. The whisper hasn’t stopped—it’s grown more deliberate, sharper, like it knows exactly where I am at all times.

I’ve been trying to keep busy, hoping exhaustion will dull it, but it only follows me. It waits, patient, bending the air around me so I can feel it.

I’ve barely slept since I last posted. The nights are longer, heavier, and I can hear things I shouldn’t. Not just in the walls, though that’s happening too.

The floorboards creak even when no one is walking. The vents breathe. My apartment hums with anticipation. And every time I say “yes”—even silently in my head—the air shifts, like a door opening somewhere behind my eyes.

I’ve gone back to the book. I shouldn’t have. It sits on the nightstand, unassuming, but I can feel it watching me. The leather is warmer now, almost pulsing beneath my fingertips. 

I flipped to a random page last night. The words weren’t the same ones I’d seen before. Some were in Latin, some in Hebrew, some I didn’t recognize. 

But in the margins, in neat little letters, someone had written: The ear that listens shall not close. And underneath that, scrawled in my handwriting, a line I didn’t remember writing: Say yes, or be unheard.

I tried to convince myself it was stress or sleep deprivation, but then I started searching online, looking for references to Azazel in the context of obedience and listening. The results were sparse and scattered. Most were religious forum posts, half-deleted pages, and blogs that claimed only fragments of the Book of Enoch survived translation. 

One forum post stood out—someone had typed: Azazel was cast into the wilderness for obedience. He heard the sins of all men, and he listened. He still listens.

It was just one post, buried in a thread about angels and fallen watchers, but my chest tightened when I read it. The whisper responded immediately. It circled my head, quiet at first, like it was chuckling under its breath. The words weren’t audible, but I felt them vibrate in my ears, in my skull: Yes…

I left the computer and went to the kitchen, needing air. The apartment was cold, sharper than usual. The condensation on the windows looked like frost, but it moved against the grain of the glass, as if something invisible was brushing against it. I reached to wipe it, and my hand froze. There, written faintly across the glass, were the letters Y-E-S. I hadn’t touched anything.

I slammed the window open. Cold air rushed in, carrying the faintest smell of sulfur and burnt iron. The whisper followed, circling the room, coming from nowhere and everywhere. Yes… yes… yes…

I tried calling my mom, my friends, anyone, but the voice isn’t on the line; it’s in the space between words. In the silence after each ring, it waits, and I can feel it listening, judging. I can’t look at anyone for long. Their words echo, warped. If someone asks me a question, the answer escapes me before I even realize I’m thinking. Yes. It’s always yes.

I’ve been scouring scripture alongside my research. Some lines make sense in the way I hoped: He who has ears to hear, let him hear. Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. But others twist when I look back later, corrupting themselves.

Yesterday I read: Blessed are those who hear, for they shall open the ear that knows. I could swear that wasn’t written that way before. It pressed against me, the cadence of the sentence like it wanted me to repeat it aloud.

The book shifts more each night. Pages curl toward me, edges darkening, ink trembling like a heartbeat. One page had a drawing of an ear, encircled and crowned with a goat-like figure, scribbled over and over: Azazel listens through the willing ear. I can’t stop thinking about that line. The whisper repeats it now, looping, sinking into my thoughts, into the gaps between heartbeats.

I’ve stopped leaving the apartment. It feels safer here. But that’s a lie. The whisper has started to move objects. Not violently, not yet, but subtly. My chair shifts slightly when I’m not looking, the lamp tilts toward me when I pass. The refrigerator hums in sync with my heartbeat. I can feel it in my skin, the vibrations, the pressure building. My hands tremble even when I try to write.

Last night, I tried speaking a prayer. Nothing formal, just a desperate string of words from memory, fragments: Lord, keep me safe… hear me… do not let me fall into obedience… The whisper answered in my own voice, low, closer than my ear should allow: You have already heard.

I dropped to the floor. My head was spinning, the apartment stretching and shrinking, the shadows pooling like ink in corners. Every surface seemed to lean toward me. My phone vibrated on the nightstand. I hadn’t touched it. A single line appeared on the screen: Listen.

I can’t explain how, but the book moved too. I opened the page with the ear drawing. The ink shivered, dark veins spreading outward like roots. I tried to close it. Tried to push it away. The whisper surged louder, now nearly intelligible: Yes… speak… hear… obey…

My chest heaves, my limbs feel like lead. The lights flicker, dim, and pulse with the rhythm of the word. I can feel the air thickening around me, pressing in. Shadows twist and stretch toward me from every surface. The window glass curves slightly as if the room itself is breathing.

I tried to stand, to flee, but the floor seemed sticky, holding me in place. My fingers graze the book’s cover and I feel a heat beneath the leather, pulsing in rhythm with my heartbeat. My own reflection in the window doesn’t move when I do. It watches me, mouth opening in a silent yes.

I can feel it now. Not fully, but it’s there—a presence just beyond the edge of vision, coiling through the air. The whisper has become a low roar, vibrating in my chest. Every object, every shadow, every line of scripture and corrupted verse merges into a single intent. It’s listening, and it’s reaching. I can’t stop it, and I don’t know if I could bring myself to not.

I can feel it now. Not fully, but it’s there—just beyond sight, pressing against the edges of perception. The whisper has thickened, layered, repeating in overlapping tones. I can’t tell if it’s coming from the walls, the book, or my own head.

And then… words start to form. Not sentences, not coherent language at first. Just flashes of understanding. Symbols, numbers, letters in ways that feel wrong but meaningful all at once. The book hums under my fingers. My vision tunnels toward the page. I know, I just know, that it’s offering me knowledge I was never meant to have.

Every instinct screams at me to stop, but the whisper presses harder. Yes… yes… yes… yes… it says, layering over itself until it’s a physical pulse in my skull. My hands shake. My teeth chatter. My chest tightens.

I can almost see it in my mind’s eye: a figure crowned with goat-like horns, a great ear stretched wide, listening. Not angry, not malicious—just patient. Offering. Teaching. Waiting for me to obey.

The knowledge flows into me like lightning through the veins, and I understand things I shouldn’t. Names of angels I’ve never heard, words of power I can’t repeat, truths about obedience, consent, and the weight of hearing. My head spins. My stomach twists. I feel as if I’m about to split in two.

The word comes back. Yes… yes… yes… yes… yes… It pounds through my brain, unrelenting. I can’t stop it. Every fiber of my being trembles with it.

And then, in the deepest, rawest part of myself, something breaks.

A scream rips from me—not a word, not a sentence, just a guttural, primal NO!

It reverberates through the apartment. The book falls silent. The hum in the vents ceases. Shadows snap back into corners. My heartbeat slows. My limbs feel like my own again. I collapse onto the floor, gasping, drenched in sweat, trembling from the rawness of shouting back at it.

I stayed there for hours, afraid to move. Afraid to breathe too loudly. Afraid to think too clearly. I waited for it to return, waited for the whisper to come back and press me into obedience again.

Morning comes. Light spills into the apartment. The air smells normal, but the faint pulse of the whisper lingers. Not as strong, not as insistent. It scratches at the edges of my mind, curious, waiting, like it’s testing whether I’ll obey next time.

I can’t tell if it’s learning from me, or if I was always part of its lesson. I don’t know if shouting no will matter again. But I do know this: it hasn’t left, and it won’t stop watching.

I’m posting this now because I have to. I have to tell someone what’s happening. I don’t know how long the calm will last, or what it wants next. All I know is that when it comes back—and I know it will—I have to be ready to resist again.

If anyone reads this, please understand. The voice is patient. It listens. It waits. And it knows when you are ready to say yes.
