I had just moved back to Texas after graduating from college when I met my future roommate, Liza. We were both broke 22-year-olds with liberal arts degrees, struggling to land jobs in our desired fields. But, as they say, the world needs plenty of bartenders. 

I was back under my parents’ roof, sleeping in the same creaky bed that had once belonged to my great-grandmother—the same one I’d slept in throughout childhood. After four years of glorious independence, the return felt like a massive regression. I swore to myself I would save enough over the summer to move out. 

I got hired at a buzzy new steakhouse that had quickly become the place to work in our suburban town. I met Liza during bar team orientation. I’m socially anxious and was zoning out as the trainer rambled about our POS system when Liza caught my eye and feigned a dramatic yawn. We giggled quietly, and I felt instantly at ease. She was striking—long black hair, almond-shaped eyes, a magnetic energy. Everyone loved her. The men at work bent over backwards for her attention, not that it mattered—Liza had a long-term boyfriend, Tai.

That summer, we slung martinis and hoarded our tips. Tai often joined us for after-shift drinks, and like Liza, he was warm, funny, easy. It felt like I had known him forever. The three of us quickly became inseparable. Despite blowing too much on bar tabs, by summer’s end Liza and I had saved enough to get a place together. At first it was just us, scavenging Facebook Marketplace and yard sales to furnish our perfect little two-bedroom. Tai was over all the time and eventually, inevitably, he moved in.

I might’ve been annoyed—except Tai was the ideal roommate. Tidy, considerate, and an amazing cook. If our lives had been a movie, the next few months would have been a montage of 20-something bliss. One particularly debaucherous night, after one too many fernets, we decided to get matching tattoos. Liza insisted we place them somewhere hidden. So, we each got a tiny yin-yang just below our hip bones.

Eventually, burnt out on the elusive dream of a journalism career, I pivoted to esthetics school. I’d always been obsessed with skincare. Popping zits in a spa all day? Yes, please. I’d clear off our curb-rescued dining room table and have Liza or Tai lie down so I could practice facial techniques. Neither of them ever had a single blemish, adding to their annoying perfection. 

About a year in, I stepped out of my bedroom one morning just as Tai emerged naked from the bathroom, having spaced on bringing his towel. We both yelped. Instinctively, my eyes darted down—and then quickly away. But in that fleeting glance, something caught my attention.

The tattoo.

It was there—but wrong. Faded, distorted. It looked like a temporary tattoo half scrubbed off. I remembered fuzzily how we’d all held hands as we took turns in the chair. It was real, but his looked like the skin was slowly absorbing it. Like his body was swallowing the ink.

I waited until Liza and I were alone after work to bring it up. She laughed off the awkward run-in, but when I mentioned the tattoo, something in her face shifted—tightened.

“I haven’t noticed anything,” she said flatly. “You’re imagining things, and I’d hope you weren’t staring long enough to even notice.”

She’d never spoken to me like that before. Her tone was cold. Foreign.

I shut down and dropped it.

Weeks passed. The air in our once-happy apartment had curdled. Liza and Tai were always in their room. I’d barely see them except when Liza would creep out of their room to microwave ramen, avoiding eye contact. I was hurt, but I hoped it would pass. 

One Friday night, I thought I had the apartment to myself. Liza was working, and I was on the couch, numbing out to trashy reality TV when I heard their door open. Tai stepped into the living room.

“Hey,” he said casually, as though nothing had happened. “Glad you’re here. There’s a spot on my back that’s been bugging me. Thought maybe you could take a look, since you’re almost a licensed professional?” Relieved, I nodded. Maybe this was our olive branch.

“You know the drill,” I said, and Tai lay face-down on the dining room table, shirtless.

The lump on his back was unlike anything I’d seen—a raised, purple-gray mound the size of a small orange, but cold to the touch. No signs of typical inflammation.

“Is it bad?” he asked.

“Typical guy,” I joked, masking my unease. “Ignore it until it’s terrifying.”

I gloved up and began to press the sides gently. No fluid came out, but something did: a dry, yellow strand poked through the surface.

Straw.

I froze. Then, carefully, I pinched it and tugged. A finger-length piece of straw slid out. “Have you and Liza been rolling around in a barn or something?” I joked, uneasy.

Tai chuckled into the table. “Not that I can remember.”

There was more. I pressed again. The opening widened, revealing a dense, matted cluster deep under his skin. I grabbed a pair of tweezers and worked in silence, lost in a trance-like focus. I needed to fix this. To fix us. Tai never made a sound. 

The front door opened. I barely registered it until—

“What have you DONE?!”

Liza’s scream shattered my focus. I looked up. The table was soaked—not with blood, but with wet hay. Straw spilled in heaps across the wood and floor.

Tai’s face was turned toward me. Eyes open. Vacant. Mouth slack.

He was dead.

Liza lunged, sobbing, fists scooping up straw, shoving it back into the gaping crater in his back.

“He’s not—” I started, but the words dissolved.

There was no blood. No tissue. Just straw and skin and the terrifying reality before my eyes:

Tai was not human.

Liza turned to me, eyes wild.

“Get out,” she whispered.

I couldn’t move.

“GET THE FUCK OUT!”

I ran. Purse in hand, keys fumbling, heart pounding against my chest. I don’t remember the drive—just the sound of gravel as I pulled into my parents’ driveway at 2 a.m., the creak of my old bed as I collapsed into it.

Somehow, I slept.

When I awoke, my purse had tipped over off the foot of my bed. Among the spilled contents on the floor was a folded piece of paper. One I didn’t recognize. I picked it up with shaking hands.

Genie,
I don’t know what’s happening to me, but I’m afraid it will happen to you too.
I’m sorry you had to be the one to stop it.
When it’s done, leave as quickly as you can.
Your friend to the end.
Love,
Tai

The note fell from my trembling fingers.

I tried to replay every moment from the past year. Had I ever seen Tai leave for work? He drank with us but never got drunk. He cooked. Cleaned. He was our therapist. He was… perfect. 

What did he mean, it would happen to me?

I called out sick for a week. Liza didn’t respond to any of my texts. When I returned to work, our manager told me she had no-showed her last three shifts. Everyone assumed we’d skipped town together.

I returned to the apartment, but it was empty. No furniture. Just a few pieces of straw scattered across the floor.

Fortunately we’d been on a month-to-month lease so it was easy to walk away, if not to forget. 

⸻

That was several months ago.

I never took the esthetics exam. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to touch another person’s skin again. Some nights, I think I see Liza’s silhouette in the corner of my eye as I polish glassware or peek in my rear view mirror in the parking garage. I dream of Tai’s empty eyes on that dining room table. His mouth. Was he smiling? 

I try to convince myself it was all in my head, but when I looked at my body in the mirror this morning I could swear my tattoo is beginning to fade.
