I’ve always been a seeker. Not for money, or fame, or any of the things most people chase. I’ve been looking for the truth. The real truth. The kind that hides in the shadows, written in dead languages on brittle parchment. I’m talking about magic.

And no, I don’t mean the fantasy crap you see in movies or read in novels. I’m not some kid who thinks waving a stick and saying fake Latin will make sparks fly. I’m talking about the real thing. The deep, dark, and often ugly underbelly of human belief. The mechanics of the unseen world. Witchcraft, goetia, theurgy, demonology. That’s been my life’s work, my obsession.

My small, one-bedroom apartment is less of a home and more of a private library. I’ve spent every spare dollar I’ve ever earned from my soul-crushing day job on books. Not just the popular stuff, either. Anyone can get a copy of the Lesser Key of Solomon. I went deeper. I have a fragile, translated copy of Shams al-Ma'arif. I’ve poured over the hateful, fearful prose of the Malleus Maleficarum. I’ve spent months trying to decipher the complex, coded rituals in The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage. I know the names, the sigils, the hierarchies. I know which spirits govern which domains, which incantations are meant to bind, and which are meant to loose.

I have all this knowledge, a universe of it, crammed into my head and onto my bookshelves. But for all my study, it’s always felt… academic. Theoretical. I’ve tried things, of course. Small rituals, scrying attempts, simple evocations in the dead of night. And the result was always the same. Nothing. Just the silence of my apartment, the smell of burnt herbs, and the bitter taste of my own failure.

It was like being a master mechanic who had memorized every schematic for every engine ever built but had never once managed to actually turn a key and hear an engine roar to life. I had the theory down cold, but I was missing something. The spark. The conduit. The “real sauce,” as I’d started calling it in my head. I was beginning to think it was all just… folklore. Intricate, fascinating, but ultimately powerless stories told by people in the dark to scare themselves. I was on the verge of giving up.

And then I found the book.

It was a total accident. A fluke. I was in a vast, old public library downtown, looking for something completely unrelated in their reference section. I took a wrong turn and ended up in a dusty, forgotten corner of the stacks marked “Archaic Philology.” It was a dead zone. The books looked like they hadn’t been touched in a century. And there, shoved horizontally on top of a row of linguistics textbooks, was a book with no markings on its spine.

Curiosity got the better of me. I pulled it down. It was heavy, bound in a plain, deep maroon leather that was worn smooth and felt strangely warm to the touch. There was no title on the cover, no author, no publisher’s mark anywhere. The pages were thick, creamy-colored vellum, and they were filled with handwritten script. The ink was a faded brown, and the handwriting was a precise, elegant, but unsettlingly sharp cursive. There was no library card, no stamp, no barcode. It didn’t officially exist.

I sat down on the floor in that dusty aisle and began to read. And I felt a thrill, a jolt of electricity that I hadn’t felt in years.

This was different.

The language was direct, plain English, but the concepts were… astounding. It wasn’t filled with the usual cryptic allegories or dogmatic warnings. It read like a practical manual, a textbook for an impossible science. It spoke of reality as a series of overlapping membranes, and of magic as the act of learning how to vibrate at the correct frequency to pass through them, or to pull something through from the other side. It was everything I had been searching for. The theory, but also the application. The “why” and the “how.”

I knew I couldn’t just check it out. It wasn’t in the system. But I couldn’t leave it there, either. This was the discovery of a lifetime. So, I did something I’ve never done before. I slipped it into my messenger bag, my heart hammering against my ribs, and I walked out of the library. It felt like a transgression, a sacrilege, but I couldn't stop myself.

Back in my apartment, I devoured it. For two days, I barely ate or slept. The book explained concepts that had always been vague in other texts. It talked about demons not as horned, malevolent entities, but as beings of pure, focused intent from adjacent realities, things that could be drawn to a specific emotional or intellectual frequency like a moth to a flame. It described rituals not as complex ceremonies with candles and circles, but as simple, focused acts of will and vocalization designed to create a specific resonance.

It was late on the third night when I found the passage. It was a simple chapter, titled “On Reciprocal Observation.” The text leading up to it explained that the simplest way to establish a connection with an entity from an adjacent membrane was to make it aware of your existence. To let it see you, so that you, in turn, could see it. It was, the book explained, the most basic and most dangerous form of invitation.

Then, there was a small, neat paragraph, indented from the main text. It read:

**The following passage, when read aloud with sincere intent, will create a resonance sufficient to attract the attention of a nearby, non-corporeal entity. It will summon a demon. Read it at your own risk.**

I scoffed. I actually let out a short, quiet laugh in my silent apartment. Read it at your own risk. It was the most cliché, boilerplate warning imaginable. I’d seen variations of it in a hundred different books. It was occult window dressing, designed to create an atmosphere of danger and mystique for the uninitiated. This book had been so practical, so direct up to this point, that this sudden dip into melodrama almost felt insulting. It was like reading a brilliant physics textbook that suddenly included a chapter on dragon-slaying.

I was jaded. I was tired of the failures. I was convinced that this, like all the others, would result in nothing. But the rest of the book had felt so right. So, with a feeling of weary, cynical curiosity, I decided to do it. What was the harm?

I took a deep breath, focused my intent as the book instructed, and read the short passage aloud. My voice sounded thin and foolish in the quiet room.

"That which is without may now be within.  
The door that is closed is the door that is open.  
I see you.  
See me."

And that was it. I waited. I listened.

Nothing.

Of course. The familiar, crushing weight of disappointment settled on me again. It was all just words. All of it. I sighed, rubbing my tired eyes. A whole life spent chasing ghosts, and all I had to show for it was a stolen library book and another failed experiment.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

The sound was so clear, so sudden and unexpected, that I physically jumped. It came from my front door. It wasn't a frantic banging or a weak tap. It was a firm, solid, perfectly normal knock.

My mind raced. Who could possibly be at my door at nearly two in the morning? I don’t have friends who drop by. I hadn’t ordered any food. Maybe a neighbor, complaining about me talking to myself?

I felt a surge of irritation. I got up from my chair, leaving the book open on the table, and walked to the front door. I looked through the peephole. Nothing. The hallway outside was empty, bathed in the sickly yellow glow of the flickering fluorescent light.

Probably just kids, I thought. Playing a prank. I unlocked the door, swung it open.

The hallway was completely, utterly empty. I leaned out, looking both ways. Silence. The elevator at the far end was still. All the other apartment doors were closed. There was no one there.

I shrugged, a feeling of anticlimax washing over me. I stepped back inside, closed the door, and slid the deadbolt into place with a heavy, satisfying thunk. A weird coincidence. That's all.

I walked back to the table, back to the book. My eyes fell to the page I had left open, to the passage I had just read. And I saw the next line. The line I hadn't read yet. The line that was directly underneath the summoning passage. My brain registered the words before their meaning truly hit me, like seeing the flash of lightning a full second before hearing the thunder.

**Please, when the door knocks, do not open it. Do not open it for any reason. Do not open it under any circumstances. It must be invited. Do not invite it in.**

I read the words once. Twice. A third time.

And the blood drained from my face. My breath hitched in my chest. A cold that had nothing to do with the temperature of the room began to seep into my bones, a deep, cellular cold of absolute, irreversible horror.

The knock wasn’t a coincidence.

The ritual had worked.

I hadn't seen a demon. I hadn’t heard its voice. It hadn't materialized in a puff of smoke in the center of my living room. That was the fantasy version. This was the practical version. The book was a manual, and I had followed the instructions perfectly. I had created a resonance. I had attracted its attention. It had come to my door, the threshold between its world and mine.

And I, like an idiot, like a fool blinded by my own arrogance and disappointment, had opened it. I had given the invitation.

I am writing this now, sitting here in my chair, not daring to move. The book is still open on the table in front of me. I can’t bring myself to touch it. I can’t bring myself to close it. The air in my apartment has changed. The silence is no longer empty. It's thick, heavy, and watchful. It feels like the silence of a room right after someone has entered and is now standing perfectly still, just behind you, waiting for you to turn around.

What do I do? Is there another ritual? Do I burn the book? Do I run? Can I even leave? Or is it attached to me now? Did I invite it into my home, or did I invite it into my life?

Please. If anyone out there knows anything about this, about this kind of reciprocal magic, about what happens when you open the door… please, tell me what to do. The silence is getting heavier, and I have the terrible, unshakable feeling that it’s not going to stay silent for much [longer](https://www.reddit.com/user/gamalfrank/).
