From: Lieutenant Lennon Aberdeen  
  
7th of October 1915.  
  
\[  
  
Hello Professor Martin, I understand that your profession in the unknown is profound and you are internationally well known. If this is true, I beg of you to take my word and investigate.  
  
At section 7J of the Mid South Atlantic, around 81 miles off the coast of Brazil. The Brazilian navy reported a large object floating on the water. They estimated it to be around half a football field long, and did not specify how wide it was. Mysteriously, the cruiser boat they had sent to investigate did not report back. The Brazilians felt an ocean quake and promptly left. This envelope shall have a translated report of the incident.  
  
No matter anyways, as the Brazilians deemed the object to be a German U-boat. Now it is important to note the consistency of our fleet. Our cargo transport consisted of two freightliners, the UCV Havana and the UCV Nassau, two cruisers, The USS Welsh and the USS Plano, and a destroyer called the USS Thunder. Due to our small flotilla. Our commanding officer requested that the USS Welsh deviate slightly from the route to intercept the object.  
  
...  
  
It took about 3 hours for the Welsh to report back to us. They reported that the object was cruising at around 10 knots an hour, and its trajectory would have it sailing South towards the Antarctic continent. The object did not fire back, nor did anything special happen. However, it was identified as a German U-boat. The cruiser had fired warning shots, yet the U-boat did not respond. The Welsh waited an hour, and then proceeded to fire its cannons at the back of the U Boat, attempting to destroy the propellers. Eventually a shot made it through, and the German boat halted. Still however, the boat made no activity. Then after about 10 minutes, it sunk into the ocean.  
  
The Welsh began its course to reconnect with the convoy. When the stern was facing where the U Boat once was, a hole appeared below the engine. First, it was only a few centimeters small, but it slowly grew to a few inches, then a foot wide. The engine room was filling with water.  
  
The Welsh still managed to make it back to the convoy, and the captain allowed for the cruiser to make a route to Rio De Janeiro before it fully sunk. We took some of their ammunition supply and assisted in pumping out water before they changed course.  
  
...  
  
At 0150 at night, we heard a rumbling noise. There was no foul weather predicted for this region of the ocean. I went out of my bunk to inspect the noise, and the ocean was shaking. The waves reached meters high, and the boat began to rock wildly. I spotted a crewmate and ordered him to fire a flare above the ocean to raise the visibility. After being ordered to do so, the man shot a red flare. It contacted the clouds, which were suspiciously low, and faded. I then told the man to come to the bridge with me. Reaching the bridge was a treacherous journey, the waves rose higher, and each step felt like walking on a rope bridge in high winds. I come from Maine and have experienced many storms at sea. None was as terrible as this.  
  
Upon reaching the bridge, we checked our speed. There must have been a strong current dragging us, as we were going twenty knots above maximum speed. I radioed the only other cruiser, the USS Plano. The Plano reported that the entire crew was awakened by the storm, and their reported speed was forty knots. From the bridge, I saw the radio operator on the deck. He was waving towards us and was making his way up. The poor soul should not have been so careless. A large wave converged over us and threw him off the boat. The man next to me had a look of horror on his face. I told him to sit down and hold himself down. The captain radioed us, saying that the weather was causing both freightliners to bring on too much water. He informed us that the fleet will be heading towards a port in Southern Brazil to wait out the storm.  
  
I contacted the Welsh to report the weather in Rio de Janeiro, but they did not respond.  
  
One of the crewmates in the bunk, who was from Argentina, had once told me of a creature with many similarities.  
  
I diverged from the path we were taking, but the current kept dragging us in one direction. It took much frustration to eventually take the boat out of the current.  
  
The waves screamed at us and yelled its insults. Every mile that we moved, the waves would lower by a meter. Eventually the convoy was out of whatever foul force had started that monsoon. I went back down to check the damage. I found that other than a missing tool kit that remained untethered. The boat was almost untouched.  
  
I went back into the hull and left the man with me to rest. I checked in with the captain and reported what was missing. Captain Winston was not happy, he bluffed the unusual weather as a hurricane passing through and doubted that we really needed to go off course. A freightliner had lost its communication with the convoy and was left isolated with no protection. The captain complained how he would be discharged from the navy and could only hope that the freightliner would make it to Argentina.  
  
...  
  
At the port of Alegre, I decided to ask the locals if there was any severe weather lately. Everyone I asked said no. However, when I detailed the occurrence to an old man. He told us a story.  
  
Long ago when the man was in his early adulthood, he worked for a fishing company. One day, he saw an empty canoe about twenty miles from the coast. His captain thought of looking into the canoe to see if there were any leftover fishing supplies.  
Once their small fishing boat came parallel to the empty canoe. A strong wind began blowing. The waves got choppier, and the canoe sank with the waves. A cloudless day had suddenly become an extreme monsoon. The captain of the fishing boat immediately ordered the vessel to return to port.  
The old man, who was working on the deck, was told by the captain that a large hole had been created below the engine. Water flowed into the engine compartment. By the time that the boat sunk, the captain and the old man were the only ones remaining. The two of them remained in place until a passing by fishing boat rescued them.  
He and his captain tried to warn everyone of a great danger at sea, but to no avail. Their story was mocked and believed to be a lie.  
I asked where the captain of the fishing boat was, the old man said that the captain had passed away many years ago from old age.  
I thanked the man for his time and headed back towards the destroyer.  
I found it odd how the man referred to the monsoon and the whole event, as if whatever caused it was a living creature.  
I met the captain, and as we readied to leave Porto Alegre, I told the captain about the old man's story.  
Obviously, the captain was skeptical, believing it to be some folk tale.  
...  
  
Our convoy was back on the original route. We needed to head about seven hundred Southwest before we reached our end. We kept a steady pacing of twenty knots Southwest.  
  
There was nothing unusual to report.  
  
...  
  
We spotted a figure in the distance, and we received a telegram.  
  
\[USS WELSH\]  
  
\[HELLO USS THUNDER. BACK FROM BRAZIL. REJOINING CONVOY.\]  
  
We sent back  
  
\[USS THUNDER\]  
  
\[WELCOME BACK USS WELSH\]  
  
It was a welcome sight to see the Welsh back in its whole. Though through the binoculars, the Welsh was considerably further than anticipated.  
  
About 30 minutes later, the Welsh could finally contact us via radio.  
  
The captain and the Welsh talked back to each other, eventually, everyone on our ship was telling the captain to ask the Welsh about what happened 2 days ago.  
  
The Welsh responded that there was indeed a light rain, and a small current heading South at about 2 knots.  
  
The Welsh was about 15 miles from the Brazilian coast during the monsoon.  
  
..  
  
Around 1540, The USS Plano, which was about a quarter of a mile ahead, reported a spotting of the missing freightliner, the UCV Nassau.  
  
The captain sighed loudly as if the UCV Nassau was the only thing on his mind.  
  
We contacted the freightliner's bridge, but there was no response. I was immediately suspicious. The freightliner was not moving, and the captain decided to investigate.  
  
He sent me and a group of 3 others to board the freightliner.  
  
The group consisted of an engineer, a soldier, a radio operator, and me.  
  
The Thunder and the Plano would continue with the UCV Havana while the Welsh would remain with us.  
  
As we boarded, the boat was unusually creaky. I was already used to tuning out the ambience of the ocean and the ship. This, however, was loud and unusually hollow sounding. The ship had aged considerably in the last 2 days. I would say it aged for about 2 years, but that simply could not be right. The ship's fence was rusted and had completely corroded in most parts. Nevertheless, I led the group towards a door.  
  
The door's handle did not budge, so I requested the soldier's handgun. I aimed at the door, and with a bang, the door handle fell off. The door swung open, and we turned on our lamps.  
  
It was a short hallway with two doors on both sides. At the end of the hallway was a stairway down. Each door opened to a damp bunk room. Within one of which, we found a journal. The engineer read aloud the most recent log.  
  
\[Fin's journal\]  
  
\[9th of December 1915.\]  
  
\[It has been a considerable amount of time since we lost contact with the convoy. Admiral Seth told us that the ship had finally exhausted all food sources. We had used all the cargo to sustain us and extend our chances of being found. We had run out of oil a few days ago already. Our chances of surviving are slim to none. I have spotted no boats in the previous month, aside from the fisherman that gave me a fish.  
  
We are at least capable of catching water. There is currently a large storm outside, probably a monsoon or a hurricane. Hopefully, the rain will last a while\]  
  
I recall that when we read that journal, it was the 10th of October 1915. Either they were not aware of the date, or something sinister is at play.  
  
We stood around in confusion, the journal made no sense to us. It explained why the boat had no power, and why the cargo was gone. However, it did not explain why the ship was in such ruins.  
  
I would prefer not to think about it too hard.  
  
The soldier turned around quickly. It scared us, but nothing was behind us. He said that he heard a noise near the brig. He was the only person to have noticed anything, but he seemed insistent to investigate. Before we could make a vote on it, he walked out of the room, and down the stairs.  
  
The rest of us were hesitant to go down, but once the light no longer reached him, his footsteps were void. I did not want to go down, and neither did the others.  
That was the last that we heard from the man.  
..  
After searching the rest of the bunks, we found nothing of interest.  
  
We stepped out of the boat. We were still uneasy from the disappearance of the man, but after the last man left the interior. We met with nothing. It was pitch dark outside, so I checked my watch. It was midnight, and the Welsh was nowhere in sight.  
  
Suddenly, a blinding light switched on. The Welsh was right next to us.  
  
We jumped, but then realized it must have been a cruel joke.  
  
They laughed as we stepped back onto the Welsh. However, as we left, the UCV Nassau right behind us was no longer in sight.  
  
This concerned me, and I remembered the first part of the old man's story. I tried to bring up my concern to the captain, and he seemed slightly concerned as well.  
  
It was too late to do anything though.  
  
As the wind blew, the crewmates chattered their teeth. The wind turned to a sour freezing temperature, and hail began to bombard the ship.  
  
The crew headed inside of the deck. It was odd. We were near the equator, it was highly unusual for it to hail.  
  
The waves were now as high as the deck. The deck began to ice over, and the hail grew to the size of tennis balls.  
  
Our attention was turned to the brewing storm, and all the while.  
  
I tried to focus on the outside of the left end of the bridge window.  
  
Whatever it was, it was large, and it rammed into us with the might of a tsunami.  
  
We were all thrown across the bridge, and I realized the danger. I called for the admiral to send out an SOS and to leave the ship.  
  
...  
  
The crewmates were lined up at the life rafts, a line of arms up to the sky.  
  
Eventually, I managed to board a raft.  
  
We dropped down, and rowed away.  
From the raft, I saw the interior lights of the Welsh.  
The Welsh had multiple large holes in the hull and whatever large thing that had rammed the Welsh, was bringing the Welsh down with it.  
  
...  
  
The power cut off from the Welsh, and the Welsh went dark. From where the ocean and the dark sky meets, I could see the silhouette of the Welsh angled halfway in the water.  
  
...  
  
...  
  
I guess I had blacked out. It was morning when I blinked. My body was bruised up from the hail. I looked around, there were seven others on the wooden raft. It was a gloomy scene, the sky was overcast and the ocean was rigid.  
  
...  
  
After several days on the water, a rescue boat was dispatched.  
It turns out that our small raft was closest to when the Welsh was last seen.  
We were the only ones they found, for when we arrived at Buenos Aires, we did not find the rest of the crew.  
Captain Winston told us that when the convoy arrived, they had been waiting for the USS Welsh to appear. Once a day had passed, they dispatched a rescue boat.  
...  
This near death scenario has brought me to write to you Professor Martin.  
I urge you to investigate this hidden force. I do not believe it was a natural monsoon, and the waves that night were far from natural.  
I believe the thing that rammed the Welsh to have been the freightliner we had previously boarded.  
Once again, I urge you to investigate.  
  
  
May this letter find you well, and I hope to see your letter back.  
Lennon Aberdeen.
