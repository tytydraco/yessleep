They say mirrors reflect who we are. But what if one day… they didn’t?

It started small. The kind of thing you brush off. I’d be brushing my teeth and think, Did I just move a second too slow? I’d shrug it off. Everyone gets weird vibes sometimes, right?

But then I saw it happen.

I was washing my face before bed. Water dripping, eyes stinging with soap. I blinked. And my reflection didn’t.

It just stood there. Still. Watching. Its mouth curled into a grin I definitely wasn’t making. I stumbled back, heart pounding, and when I looked again—it was back to normal. Copying me perfectly.

I didn’t sleep that night.

Over the next week, things got worse. I caught it staring when I wasn’t looking. Eyes just a little too wide, smile a little too sharp. Once, I turned my back for a second and felt breathing on my neck—only to spin around and find no one there.

Except my reflection, staring with open, eager eyes.

I covered the mirrors. Every single one. Bedsheets, tape, cardboard. But it didn’t stop.

One night, I woke up to the unmistakable sound of glass cracking.

The bathroom light was on.

The mirror I had covered was now uncovered. The sheet was folded neatly on the floor, like someone had gently removed it.

And he was there.

My reflection.

But not me.

He waved.

Then he stepped forward.

And pulled me in.

It was like falling into freezing water, only I didn’t stop falling. The cold wasn’t on my skin it was inside my bones, hollowing me out. My body twisted, time blurred, and when I could see again…

I wasn’t in my bathroom anymore.

Not exactly.

It looked the same at first. But the light was off. The colors were dull. Everything felt flat. Dead. I stepped out into the hallway my hallway and it was the same story. Furniture in the right places. Doors in the right spots. But no sound. No warmth. No life.

And then I saw the mirror.

Only now, I was behind it.

I watched my doppelgänger walk into my bathroom, stretch, yawn, and grin. He was me. Perfectly. But too perfect. His movements were smooth, confident like someone playing a well-rehearsed role.

He looked right at the mirror. Right at me.

And winked.

I screamed. I pounded on the glass until my fists bled. He didn’t flinch. Just walked away, humming my favorite song.

That was… I don’t know how long ago. Days? Months? Time doesn’t work the same here.

This world is hollow. There’s no outside. Every door just leads back to more silence. No clocks, no people, no sound except my own breathing. I can eat nothing. I can touch nothing. And I am always… alone.

Except for the mirror.

I watch him live my life. Flawlessly. Sometimes I catch him smiling at someone I used to know. He’s charming, funny. Better than I ever was.

He took my life.

And left me here.

Forever.

Sometimes, I wonder… was he always the real one?

Or was I just his shadow from the beginning?

If you’re reading this, do yourself a favor:
Never trust the mirror when it smiles.

Because one day, it might want more than your reflection.

It might want you.
