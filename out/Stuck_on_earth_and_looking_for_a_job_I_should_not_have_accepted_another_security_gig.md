My roommate returned home not long after I had come back from the beach. She wore a triumphant smile, but her face fell when she saw me. I was sitting on the couch in a fresh pair of pants, applying ointment to the wounds on my cheeks, nose and forehead with the help of a hand mirror. Kit Sutton hastily deposited her musical gear by the door before rushing to my side. 

"What the hell happened to you?" she blurted out, waving her hands about as if she wanted to wipe the injuries from my face.

"Nothing, nothing at all." I inspected the three long, deep scratches. They weren't burning as much anymore, but they'd undoubtedly turn into scars. Then again, there was not a trace left of the bullet wound on my shoulder, so perhaps my immune system would take care of the aesthetic side of things. A shame, really—I'd imagined it would have looked intimidating and mysterious. I set the mirror aside. "How was your day?"

"Everything went well, actually… Eva, really, are you okay?"

"Yes. As you can see. What happened after I left?"

"I performed the rest of my program, of course. It was good. People clapped. Frankie kept rolling his eyes at me, though; I don't think he likes my style all that much. I'm still sort of… amazed at what you've got going on there. You have a weird taste in men."

"You said he was nice."

"He's friendly enough. Well, he clearly thinks he's better than me, but so do you and *we* get along famously. So that's actually not the issue here." She pursed her lips and shook her head slightly. "I probably sound like a cow right now, but I could never overlook the aesthetic side of things. He gives me the creeps. I know him now, but still. It's just… beyond me, why you're so… smitten."

"You sound just like Nettie. I don't get it; Frankie is gorgeous. What is it that throws you off about him?"

"You really don't see it?"

"Obviously not."

"Nevermind then. I'm sorry, it's none of my business."

I huffed. "I bet you have a far weirder taste in women. I'm lucky I haven't encountered any of those elusive creatures you've consorted with so far."

"That's what you think," Kit said. 

"What?"

"Oh, nothing." She scratched the shaved side of her head. "Hey, you, uh… you fought a deep one again, didn't you? I thought I'd caught, like, a glimpse of one of them earlier, but they were gone before I… And then so were you…" Bright blue eyes came to meet mine and I sighed. 

"I tried to be discreet," I mumbled. "I didn't wanna ruin your set."

"Eva, you… I can't even begin to tell you how much I appreciate this. Set be damned. But we can't keep doing this, can we? You're not my bodyguard! I don't want you to—" Her voice cracked. 

"You weren't this concerned when you summoned the crab."

"That was different. They show up on their own! I don't want them to hurt you."

I cracked my knuckles and flexed my arms before comfortably sinking back against the worn backrest of the sofa. "They can't. They won't. I can handle it."

"Yeah, *now*. But what if this happens more often? What if it doesn't stop? You have limits, too, don't you?"

I allowed myself a grin. "None that I've discovered yet." 

"Right; the one time *I'm* serious you gotta turn cocky." She grunted, her shoulders sagging. "Hell, you could actually have a point. You might be more powerful than *a lot* of the deep ones, but the thing is, they're like an inexhaustible resource. They're minions, and for as long as they're ordered to chase me, they will."

"Why don't we take it to the source then?" I suggested, my voice low. "Your father."

My roommate chuckled mirthlessly. "That's the one thing we absolutely can't do. It's actually a problem that can't be solved. You might not be human, but there's things you could never go up against. Things here, on earth. He's one of those. I'm not talking black holes and dimension eaters, but there's… there's still nature, Eva. Dad's got a way with the elements. You couldn't beat him, ever."

I stared up at the ceiling in thought. "If you say so," I conceded at length. "You probably know about that better than I do. I don't mean to underestimate any force I'm unfamiliar with, but I'm… well, intrigued, at any rate."

"I know."

"Any chance you could tell me what *Chandra* means? The deep one kept saying that."

"It doesn't have a meaning, actually. Chandra, that's… it's a name."

I drew myself up. "Is it your old name? From before?"

Kit Sutton gave me a sad smile. "Not really. It's what they used to call me, yes, but that person wasn't me."

This morning, I got a call from Elijah Carter, asking to meet up for burgers. I agreed and he came to pick me up. When we had finished our lunch around an hour later, he opened up about his motive for inviting me.

"So, we earned a bit of cash the other day."

"I recall."

He smirked. "I had a feeling you would. Look, don't tell Nettie I even brought this up, she'll have my hide. The Collective reached out with another job. They said I'd be free to bring someone else, and they're offering *double* of what we got last time."

"Eight thousand for each of us?"

"Yup. We need to make our decision fast, because they need us right away—tonight."

"Seems they never leave much time for contemplation," I remarked. 

"Chances are that's on purpose." He took a long slurp of his soda, holding my gaze from across the dirty table. Sarcasm and weariness mingled in his dark eyes. An odd combination if ever I'd seen one, but somehow, it was distinctly *Elijah*. "So what do you say? Are we gonna do this again?"

"You shouldn't be asking *me* that," I replied. "The last time was hard on you, wasn't it?"

"Sure it was. But think of the money."

"Is it worth it?" I asked, searching his features. 

Eli growled and set down his cup. "Don't baby me, Shirley."

"I'm not," I hurried to tell him. "It's only that you were in a bad way back there. I think that's worth considering. If you decide to go, I'll come with you. If you still want me to. You gotta be certain, is all."

He was certain. Certain enough to drive us out to the warehouse come nightfall. I wasn't particularly worried about being recognized by the masked people. I doubted that the person who'd paid us and the one who'd cleaned up the blood were one and the same, so with any luck, we'd be okay. Still, I stayed in the car while Elijah received the warehouse keys. Once we were by ourselves, we entered the building and I immediately went up the stairs to check the door leading out onto the fire escape. It was locked this time. They did learn.

"Have a look at this," Eli called out, and I joined him down in the hall. 

The big red container had been replaced by a much smaller, narrow crate. It was of the same heavy, metallic material, with a big lock hanging from it. I circled it warily, getting a good look at it from all sides. Something about it caused the hairs on the back of my neck to bristle, some suppressed instinct urging me to stay away. And yet I couldn't avert my gaze. A misplaced sense of curiosity sparked within me.

"They've downsized," Eli muttered.

I gave him an absent nod. "You know what; we should check inside."

I don't believe I've ever seen Elijah Carter look at me the way he did in that moment. He'd turned to face me fully, his whole body tense and ramrod straight. His eyes were blown wide, his brows had wandered nearly all the way up to his hairline and his jaw had lowered only a bit. "'Scuse me?"

"We should open it up and see what's inside."

"Shirley, are you outside of your mind?"

"I'm not. Think about it, we should know what we're looking after here. Especially with what's been happening."

"We won't get paid. They might come after us; there's gonna be consequences."

"Not if they don't find out. Can you pick locks?"

"No, of course not. Look, this is a really bad idea. Just leave it," he insisted, his tone getting sterner and sterner by the second.

"Aren't you curious? Don't you think we should know?"

"No, I sure as shit don't. Goddamnit, this is, like, *slutty dumb girl in a horror movie*-stuff."

"What do you mean by that?"

Eli hummed and scratched his brow. "Don't you watch horror movies?"

"Not regularly, no. I get scared far too easily. I can never sleep afterwards."

"You're kidding, right?"

I looked at him with a straight face and shrugged.

Elijah sighed. "There's a trope in these flicks; the girls who are the most promiscuous are usually the stupidest. They make brainless decisions and get the whole cast killed; themselves first, usually."

"That could never be me," I told him. "Nettie says I'm very intelligent. Also, I don't have sex."

At this, he sighed again for a long time. We left it at that, though. I didn't want to argue with him. He seemed genuinely convinced that it was for the better if we left the crate alone. Instead, we spent some time chatting, then we huddled up and watched a movie on his phone. Every fifteen minutes, we'd get up and walk around the warehouse to make sure nothing was out of place. The atmosphere in the old building was just as uncomfortable as last time, but at least there were no unusual incidents to speak of. There were no strange sounds or bodily fluids coming from within the box we were guarding. I couldn't shake my nervous curiosity, but I didn't act on it either. It was a weird feeling, nothing more. A thought that kept pushing itself to the forefront of my mind, pointless and unfounded but irritatingly hard to ignore.

*It would be best if you knew what's in there, it would be best if you knew what's in there…*

It was driving me crazy. I brought it up to Eli again after a couple hours had gone by, and it sparked another animated discussion. He gained the upper hand once more, though. Finally, our thankfully uneventful shift came to an end. The same masked person from before came to join us inside the large hall. They inspected the crate before turning to us, their posture relaxed and their hands clasped behind their back.

"How'd it go?" they asked, their voice as unreadable as I remembered.

"Uh… good, fine. Nothing happened," Elijah replied.

"Hm," the stranger uttered, walking past us towards the door. They held it open and my friend and I hurriedly followed them outside. The air was clear and fresh, and while darkness still laid heavy over the roofs and treetops, I could spot the first rosy gleam of sunrise in the distance. The masked stranger made a show of taking in a deep breath, their flat chest visibly rising and falling. Rolling their shoulders with a satisfying crack, they came to face Elijah Carter and me once more.

"This is shaping up to be a wonderful morning, don't you think?" 

The remark wasn't directed at either one of us in particular. Eli and I traded uncertain glances, coaxing a chuckle from our mysterious employer. Reaching into the pocket of their motorcycle jacket, they produced a large, thick wad of cash which they handed to Elijah. "Thank you very much. We might come to rely on your services more often, if it always goes this well."

"We won't mind," Eli assured them, starting to flick through the bills with sharp eyes and the edge of a smile.

"Sure you wouldn't." The person took a step closer to me, their chin lowering and lifting again as they inspected me. I held my head up high, not daring to show my discomfort with their scrutiny. They stepped around me, eyeing me up from behind before coming to stand right before me again; very, very close. I stared at their mask with what I hoped to be a hardened expression, clenching my hands into fists to hide their pesky quivering. 

"You have beautiful eyes," the stranger said softly. 

"Oh, I don't know." I didn't feel very flattered.

"You do. Your hair is nice, too. You wouldn't mind if I touched it, would you?"

I glanced over at Eli. He was still busy counting our money. I silently willed him to look over at me, but I couldn't seem to draw his attention. I genuinely didn't know how to react. "Go ahead," I finally muttered. 

The masked person let out an amused snort before pulling off one of their leather gloves and proceeding to run slender fingers along the side of my head, trailing the braid until resting their palm flat atop my hair. I could feel their thumb pressing against my scalp. A shiver ran through me, causing my entire body to quake. This time, I couldn't hide it. My throat worked and I rolled my lips together, briefly looking down. This felt wrong. It was such a casual touch, but it made me want to disappear. I mean it. I would have preferred for the ground to open up and swallow me than to stand this close to the stranger any longer. 

Finally, *finally*, they withdrew, fumbling their glove back on. Then, they playfully nudged my side, causing me to take a step back. "Yeah, you're cute. You have a mean look about you, but you're cute. I was wondering about that the first time I saw you, you know; I kept asking myself what use you'd be on a security shift like this. I mean, you're just this… this teensy little bit of a thing. No offense." They raised an arm to indicate my lacking height. 

"None taken," I said slowly.

"So how come? Why are you here?"

"To keep my friend company and earn some cash."

"Right. Company." They sighed. "And that's the truth? Your final verdict? There's nothing special about you?"

"Nothing whatsoever."

"Alright. Sorry, I didn't mean to be weird. It's just that I constantly gotta watch out for strange stuff, considering what I'm doing here."

"Right," I answered, trying to keep my tone as polite as possible. "So… what exactly *does* your Collective do?"

A chuckle came from behind the mask. "Wouldn't you like to know. We do have a greater cause, believe it or not. We're not just a bunch of idiots holing themselves up in abandoned buildings and dancing around boxes. But as much as I’d like to share, you’re gonna have to take my word on it. I really can’t tell you.”

“That’s too bad.”

They tilted their head. “Yes. Yes, it’s a shame.”

“Are you coming?” Elijah Carter called out to me, having already unlocked his car and holding the passenger side door for me. 

“I should go,” I told the masked person.

“You should,” they echoed, not moving out of my path.

I frowned and made an attempt to step around them, but they mirrored the movement, blocking me off. I bumped into them, briefly connecting with their chest before stumbling back. I narrowed my eyes at them. “What are you doing?”

They didn’t respond.

I tried to push past them again, but they still wouldn’t let me. I could hear Elijah slam the car door shut once more before approaching us in large, heavy strides. “What’s going on?” he asked loudly, and I took note of the unsettled edge in his tone. The masked person shot a quick look at him over their shoulder, humming to themselves. “I oughta hurry,” they told me, reaching into the pocket in the side of their jacket and whipping out something dark and slim. An object that I realized far too late was a large folding knife. My eyes registered the movement, but it happened way too fast for me to process, let alone react. With a flick of the stranger’s wrist, the blade snapped out, and before I could even blink, it was buried in the pit of my stomach. 

I didn’t scream or cry out. I simply looked down in utter disbelief, my vision blurring as I struggled to train my eyes on the hand twisting the knife in my stomach. I was frozen in place, my brows raised and my mouth agape. Astonished, I looked up at my assailant. The pressure of their weapon was unrelenting. Their other arm moved to encircle me, keeping me in place. Their features remained veiled, obscured behind that plain black mask, completely hidden from sight. Weirdly enough, right at that moment, I found myself wondering what they looked like. After turning the blade inside of me, they dragged it to the side with such force that my body nearly moved along with it. It tore through skin and flesh, slashing me open before finally withdrawing. The stranger folded the knife back up in a single, swift movement before stepping around me and walking off to their motorcycle which was again parked near the treeline. I let my gaze trail after them before turning back to face Elijah. 

He was standing a few feet ahead of me, completely paralyzed. He was staring at me, his face a grimace of shock and horror. He gagged when I felt something *shift* in my belly region. Looking down, I saw something red and oozy swelling out of the gushing fresh wound. *That can’t be right.* I grabbed it and tried to carefully push it back in, where I assumed it belonged. It felt odd; both firm and squishy at the same time. I didn’t like touching it. The blood that came streaming out of the gash had made it slippery; I couldn’t get a proper grip on it. *Come on, get back in there…*

More and more of the weird stuff curled out of my stomach. It reminded me of a snake poking its head out of a burrow. I stifled a laugh at the sheer absurdity of the mental image, still attempting to fold the fleshy masses back into the newly torn hole. Suddenly, Elijah was at my side. He removed my arms from the wound, gently guiding me to the ground and kneeling down behind me. He pulled my back into his lap, supporting my weight as my head lolled back.

“Stop that, don’t shove it back in,” he instructed, his voice cracked and frail. He sounded close to tears. “Just hold it, hold it up… Your legs, you gotta bend your knees and kinda pull them up. Yes, like that. It’ll be okay, I promise, you’re gonna be fine…”

And that was when the pain set in. I don’t know why I hadn’t felt it before, but there it was. It rolled over me like a wave, blinding me, making me arch my back and howl like an animal. Somewhere in the distance, I heard Elijah Carter make a phone call. I wanted to keep quiet for him, but I found that I couldn’t. That first scream had opened the floodgates, and now I absolutely couldn’t stop shrieking. My voice rang out again and again, until I felt Eli’s large, cold palm covering my forehead. 

“Can you hear me? The ambulance is gonna be here real soon, in just a few minutes. You can take it until then, right?” His voice was right there by my ear, his breath pleasantly fresh on my searing hot skin. His arms moved past my shoulders to join my own hands in covering the wound. He grunted, then leaned back again to shrug off his zipper hoodie. He pressed it onto my bleeding stomach, and soon enough, the blue fabric darkened as a red stain forced its way through from below. “Just a few more minutes,” he told me, firmly placing a kiss on my forehead. “You can do it, okay? You can do it.” 

The warmth seemed to be seeping from my body together with my fluids. I pushed myself flush up against Eli’s chest, trying to absorb some of his body heat. He thankfully understood and tightened his arms around me, combating the oncoming chill. Before long, it wasn’t enough anymore. I began to shiver like mad, the cold so strong that it was almost a pain of its own.

“Fuck… Look, I got an emergency blanket in the car, can you hold yourself up if I just—” He didn’t wait for an answer, instead carefully moving me into a curled up sitting position before sprinting to his station wagon. I watched him tear through the interior before returning with a small package. He threw himself onto his knees beside me, fumbling open the bundle and producing a shiny, crinkling material. He proceeded to swaddle me in the noisy tissue, working around my clothes and the blood-soaked sweater still covering the wound. It was getting harder and harder to keep my eyes open, and by the time he was done and came back around to sit behind me, I could feel myself falling asleep. Elijah kept lightly slapping my cheek. “Hey, hey, stay up. Come on,” he coaxed in a strained energetic tone. “Talk to me.”

“About what?” I murmured, blinking at him.

“What did you eat today?”

“I don’t know…”

“I know. We had burgers together.”
“Right,” I remembered, nestling deeper into the blanket. “Are you gonna call Nettie?”

“Yeah, sure. Sure.”

“Don’t tell her about the burgers. She doesn’t believe in fast food.” 

I’m not sure if I finished that sentence. I merely rested my head against Elijah Carter’s shoulder and drifted off to sleep.
