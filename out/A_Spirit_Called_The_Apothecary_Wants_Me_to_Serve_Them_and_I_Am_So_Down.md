I’m an idiot. I suck at delivering packages. The guy who accepts the packages I bring back at the end of the day has taken pity on me because I bring back so many, looking pathetic the whole while.

I’m also not that great at writing. I think the only reason The Apothecary chose me is because I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia last year, or rather, I have the necessary cracks in my mind to allow him to reach through and talk to me. 

And through me, to you.

Here’s what they said to open with.

“I am the Apothecary. I work from a temple of service that hangs over the Abyss. My purpose is to ensure that the storehouse of this temple is running smoothly. 

“When the mages, priests, clerks, servants, and wizards of this temple come across Spirits that are not in proper context at any point in space or time, they send them to me, to my storehouse. 

“It is my job and privilege to, guided by the Flame of Wisdom, send these spirits to a context that is conducive to their development.”

The Apothecary reached out because they need people to deliver the spirits that they send. They told me that they would enable me to travel from this physical realm to the astral to the mental to the spiritual realms in this my physical form so that I could deliver the spirits where they need to go.

To start the day I pray over my truck full of packages. 

“God, may the spirits of the Apothecary I am allotted to deliver for today enter into these physical packages. May the destination of the package and the spirit within align, so that I may travel there to deliver these to their proper context. Amen.”

It gets trippy when I do this and I do it every day now. If you’re a delivery driver and you’re going to try it, remember the wisdom we learn from psychedelics. No matter how much it feels like it, nothing is permanent. You always land back on your feet eventually. Even if it takes eternities. 

At the end of the day, with the last package delivered, I have another prayer I say so that I stay sane. 

“God, as I drive back to the terminal, allow me to enter back into the physical so that I can function properly with my friends, family, and home responsibilities. Amen.”

That works 98% of the time. If it doesn’t I assume there’s still some work that needs to be done and I keep an eye out for it. 

I started to work for the Apothecary because of the promise that he made me. 

“If you will work for me, take an oath of service to what is, and take my task upon you. 

"You will receive that which you need and want in the present moment continually, supposing that it will be for your long-term wellbeing according to the Flame of Wisdom. 

“This is not forever, nor is it binding; You will serve me as long as you will it and you will be allowed to separate yourself from me when you wish it.

“This is the same contract that I have with God, except that if I wish to leave my responsibilities then I must train my replacement and pass them along to them.”

I have found it to be true. Since I started working for the apothecary, I haven’t lacked for anything I need. For example, my paycheck came in a day early once so I could pay rent on time. Or I woke up late and didn’t have time to grab breakfast once and a work buddy brought me a bagel. It’s subtle. Hot girls aren’t climbing into the back of my van to give me head every day but I guess that wouldn’t be for my long-term wellbeing according to the Flame of Wisdom. I‘m happy with it, and I think you will be, too, if you try it. 

There is a lot more that the Apothecary has told me, like the secret hand sign that can bless other delivery drivers with the flame of wisdom, or the greater oaths that bring you greater promises and responsibilities, but I’ll save them for later.
