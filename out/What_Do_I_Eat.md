Mother always taught me what to answer when someone asked that question, which was strange. Not only did no one ever ask me that question, I didn't even know what the word in asking meant.

The answer(s) to the question was weird too.

“Grains" - What are those? 

“Fruits" - Same goes here.

“Veggies" - Another weird word.

“Meat" - What kind of?

But since nobody ever asked that question I never bothered to learn about those answers.

As the years went on, mom stopped talking about that question and given that she was the only one to ever bring that up, I had not learnt about what that term meant either.

I don't remember when the phenomenon started. Was it when I got into double digits? Teenage years? Even later on? Frankly speaking, I don't think the particular experiences popped up on just one random day, even though I think I do remember the very first singular occurence. The emptiness began as a momentary thing before eventually transforming into something of permanence and the gradual transformation might've took months if not a few years.

Although I think of it as a gradual process now, I was absolutely shocked when I saw I lacked a finger on my left hand on a random morning. I immediately rushed to my mom, who looked shocked yet prepared. She prepared something called a “meal" and then inserted it into me through my mouth. It felt weird but good on my tongue at first, although it wasn't great overall. In the end though, it didn't make my finger reappear.

Few days went by, during which mom made sure to regularly repeat the same thing at uniform time intervals. I learned how to do the process myself as well and kind of enjoyed that little time period. I could see bits of my finger reappearing but soon I began to be frustrated about it not regrowing fully. She asked me to have patience so I obliged, not knowing of any better solutions.

By the time my finger grew back, I had another problem. Half of my right ear had gone missing. I wasn't shocked as much as I was disappointed. I went to my mom again who repeated the same process again, although the taste was a bit different.

Even before my finger had regrown completely, I noticed that part of my ear had gone missing. Mom kept repeating the same process but soon I found myself missing multiple parts at a time. The parts misssing weren't so important as to hinder my daily life but they were a cause of great frustration. Mom's medicinal meals weren't swift enough to keep up with the pace of absentees. Soon the vexation took over and I thought of looking for better solutions. 
I didn't have to though.

“Here, take these" I heard father say. 

The things were... revolting to say the least. 

A toe, lower left portion of a tongue and part of a lower lip. 

“What am I to do with these?"

“Eat them of course"

“How to...?"

“You already know how to"

He was right in that. What shocked me was that almost immediately after I ate them, my body parts had regrown. They felt itchy at first, but soon it felt seamless. I didn't eat mom's meal that day.

But just a day or two later I saw that my heel was gone. Although I was going to call for mom at first, I went to dad first this time. He had it ready on the plate to serve. Walking wasn't inconvinient anymore.

Losing body parts wasn't an issue anymore as he always had the exact thing of need prepared to perfection. Mother's meals were a thing of the past then.

Things didn't stay rosy throughout however. One day I woke up feeling oddly light. It wasn't until I went to instinctively get hair out of my eyes that I noticed that I had no fingers. Or hands. Or the entire arm for that matter.

This was the first time I lost such a big part at once. I couldn't muffle in my scream and hearing that mom immediately rushed in. Understanding my situation she immediately went to prepare one of her medicinal meals. While mom was busy I went to father to see if he could help me again. He already had an entire arm that I then went on to feast upon. I never saw mother with her meal.

A few days later I woke up feeling so incredibly uncomfortable that I shouted for my dad while laying on the bed. He came in with a really revolting piece of meat but I didn't waste any time. Things felt alright after eating it.

Soon I began losing numerous body parts inside a single day. But they didn't worry me much as dad always had all the things I needed to have them regrown. Gradually I began spending most of the day eating skin, limbs and pieces of meat I didn't know location of. 

On one random day, I woke up while already sitting and saw my dad cleaning up a plate I didn't remember saying out of. When I asked dad about it, he told me not to worry about it. Since I already had the next meal prepared, I didn't have any issues to worry about.

Life was going on great with delicious meals surrounding me every moment. I wasn't even aware of what parts I was missing or what parts I was eating. I felt filled and I felt well, so I didn't care to think about it much.

And to come to the present day, life still goes on great. Dad always prepares the perfect meals as I never go a moment without being content. There's nothing in my life that feels out of place, there's nothing that I think of as missing. Sometimes I actually eat multiples of the same stuff even though I can't have possibly lost that much of the same physical parts. But they taste great so I don't question about it. Why would I ever?

I did ask my dad about something yesterday. There was a picture of a random teenager with my parents in my house who I never remembered meeting. The picture made me think that the kid must be someone close to my parents which prompted the question.

“Dad, who is this kid?"

“Don't worry about it"

“Alright, dad"
