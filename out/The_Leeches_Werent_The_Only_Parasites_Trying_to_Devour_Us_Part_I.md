It had been exactly three weeks since I’d moved out of Claudia’s apartment and into this crumbling, half-condemned corner of Los Angeles. The kind of neighborhood people warned you about on online forums and true crime podcasts. Stray dogs howled at night. Power flickered if you dared to microwave something. The streets had more cracks than pavement, and the buildings leaned like they were whispering secrets to each other.

But no matter how hostile or decayed this place felt, it was still safer than where I came from.

We were supposed to start a new life here. Me and Claudia. A life in California, under big skies and second chances.

It’s not something I talk about because who would believe a 5’10 man over a 5’1 woman?

She didn’t hurt me with fists. It was all with words—meticulously cruel ones. She had a gift for it. A scalpel for a tongue. She called it “just being honest,” but honesty doesn’t leave you crying in parking lots, questioning your entire worth.

Claudia humiliated me every chance she got. She weaponized my vulnerabilities, the ones I gave her willingly, lovingly. She called me pathetic in front of her friends. She laughed at me in text threads she forgot to hide. And when I tried to leave, she got worse. Spiteful. Vindictive. She emptied my bank account under the excuse of needing money for her singing career, which never took off. Because let’s face it, the woman has about as much discipline as a wet sock.

Now I am here. Three weeks in. Barely surviving.

The only thing holding me together was the tiny gym in the basement of my crumbling apartment complex. The weights were rusty, the air was stale, and the mirrors warped. Strangely, there was a considerable number of weights. And there was enough weights here to complete my circuits. Since I couldn’t afford BJJ classes, lifting plates and doing reps was all I could do against the creeping madness of being twenty-four, broke, and completely alone.

I had nothing to show for anything but an associates degree and an academic dismissal record from UCLA, another one of Claudia’s many legacies. I had done well in community college back home in Florida, getting high marks. But all of that was over now.

As I finished my final overhead press, a deep tremor shook the building. The plates on the rack rattled like teeth. It was the third one that week. They had to be earthquakes. This city was after all sitting on the San Andreas fault.

The scientists on the news speculated it was subsidence. That they were “shifting fault lines,” they and “underground instability due to water tables.” But these tremors felt too light, too sporadic, and too deliberate to be natural.

Squishy, writhing sounds were reported to have been heard along with the tremors by utility workers both on the surface and below ground. There were whispers of shadows moving in sinkholes, of screeching that didn’t sound human. But nothing was verified.

Before I could contemplate any of this further, I heard the door open.

I looked over and saw tanned skin, twin braids, black yoga shorts and a burgundy sports bra that framed her like she was carved from marble. Her eyes were soft but alert, deer-like. Her body was chiseled and toned, like that of a CrossFit instructor. Abs were slightly visible on her midriff.

She didn’t notice me as she walked past with her air pods in, stretching absently. As I moved through my circuit, I caught her reflection in the warped mirrors and caught her glancing at me too.

Thirty minutes later, I was done. As I made for the door, I passed one last mirror.

Our eyes locked. I then caught a ghost of a smile as I glanced into the mirror.  Was that directed at me? I didn’t see anyone else besides the two of us in that tiny gym.

I didn’t think too much of it as I hauled myself back up the stairs and let myself into my apartment, muscles sore from all the weightlifting. The next morning, I was up early. Not that I could sleep very well, let alone need an alarm clock. The nightmares did a better job waking me up.

The tremors continued, still not showing patterns typical to earthquakes. They came in pulses, like breathing. Like something under us was stretching, waking up.

A baby’s cry jolted me upright. The sound came from outside my apartment.

I stepped out onto the narrow balcony. And there she was. The CrossFit lady from last night.

She sat on the porch next to mine, holding a softly crying baby close to her chest. No makeup now. Just sweatpants, a faded tank top, and those same braids trailing down her shoulders. Her tattoos were more visible now: a winding snake disappearing under the waistband of her pants, a mandala design on her shoulder, and just beneath her collarbone, a compass inked in black.

We locked eyes.

I braced for the usual gestures I get from girls. The eyerolls, turn aways, maybe a muttered “what are you looking at?” as they glared at me.

But I was stunned when she smiled at me. Her expression was warm and welcoming. Her nose piercing glistened in the dawning light. She raised her tiny hand in a gentle wave.

“Hi,” she chirped with a slight pink hue washing over her cheeks.

I blinked, returning a crooked smile while waving back awkwardly. “H-hey.”

“You new around here?” she asked, voice low, almost lyrical. She sounded American, but something in her tone hinted at roots further south.

“S-somewhat.”

She held my gaze, and her smirk. “Me too. Moved in two days ago.”

Her phone slipped from her pocket. “Ugh.” She leaned over to grab it, and I caught another tattoo along her spine. It was some kind of text. Foreign. Faded. Like a scar she made beautiful.

The ground trembled again—more forcefully this time. A soft *crack* echoed nearby. Somewhere close, maybe beneath us, something shifted.

She flinched. Just slightly.

“You feel that?” I asked.

She nodded slowly. “Yeah. I have.” She said slightly rocking her baby.

We stood there in silence; the air was tight with a hint of unease.

I rubbed the back of my neck and adjusted my tie. “Please excuse me. But I must get going.”

Her mouth curved into a wider smile, teeth glistening in the light. “Have a good day, Papi.”

I nervously glanced back and peeped a silent thanks as I walked away. I felt my cheeks flush a dark shade of red. If she called me Papi one more time, I swear I was going to melt into a gooey puddle on the floor. I walked to work like I always did. Four miles through a city that seemed to sag more with every step. The sidewalks had new cracks. Light poles leaned slightly further. Somewhere in the distance, I saw a patch of sidewalk that seemingly dipped into the ground.

A city utility truck was parked next to it, but no one was working. The cones had just been haphazardly placed there seemingly without thought. The caution tape attached nearby was fluttering like poorly poled flags.

I didn’t stop. I never did. When your life is unraveling, the best you can do is keep moving forward and pretend you’re still part of the world.

My job was at a massive, two-story building on the edge of the industrial district. It was a plain, mostly windowless two-story building located at the middle of assfuck metropolitan nowhere. The building is made of faded stucco and industrial concrete. It was designed more like a prison than a place where people worked eight hours a day.

From the outside, it looked like a cheaply built, square-shaped building with brutalist architecture. But inside, it was a labyrinth of cubicles stretching into fluorescent infinity. Dozens upon dozens of people sat in their little gray pens, their voices rising and falling like radio static as they answered calls, took complaints, and tried not to scream.

Thank God I didn’t work on the phones. I had my associate’s degree, which meant I was just qualified enough to be buried under spreadsheets instead of voicemails.

The front doors slid open, doors screeching slightly against the floor. I was immediately hit with the scent of burnt coffee and printer toner. The hum of bad lighting and worse ventilation in this makeshift warehouse-like building settled into my bones like it always did. This place didn’t just feel like a prison—it *was* one. A beige coffin they paid us to climb into for eight hours a day.

I remembered what one of the phone reps had once joked that working at a call center is like being in a prison they pay you to be at.

“Bout time you dragged your sorry behind in here, Martin,” chuckled a voice from behind the receptionist's desk.

It was Angela.

The office secretary—and unofficial queen of sarcasm. A short, sharp-tongued African American woman in her twenties with perfect eyeliner, impossibly long nails, and a voice that could cut through drywall. She had a gold tooth that glinted every time she smiled.

“You tryna set a record for ‘most zombies avoided during a morning commute’ or what?” she said, raising one painted brow.

“Maybe.” I muttered, cracking a smile despite myself.

She nodded once. “Mhm. You look like you fought off three sinkholes and a bad haircut on the way here.”

She wasn’t wrong. I nevertheless gave her a mock salute and headed toward the accounting corner. My cubicle was in the back left corner of the building, away from the worst of the call center noise but close enough to hear it leak through the thin walls. The overhead fluorescents buzzed like dying flies.

I sat down at my desk, logged in, and opened my first spreadsheet of the day. Line after line of vendor totals, expenses, revenues, balance reconciliations, and overdue reimbursements. The kind of mindless repetition that blurred the hours and dulled your soul in equal measure. $16.50 an hour. No benefits. No 401(k). Just the soft promise that if I stayed long enough, I might get a .50 cent raise.

My boss, Martha, made her appearance around 9:30 AM. I heard her before I saw her—heels clicking down the linoleum like gunshots. Martha was Jamaican, in her early fifties, with close-cropped hair, brilliant earrings, and a laugh that came out like a punchline to a joke you weren’t sure you wanted to hear. She had a gold tooth like Angela, but hers caught the light like a warning. She had a wicked, dark sense of humor that made some people uncomfortable—but I liked it.

“Martin,” she said, peeking over my cubicle wall like a cat scoping prey. “You still alive?”

“For now,” I muttered, fingers tapping numbly at my keyboard.

“Good. Keep it that way. Dead men don’t process expense reports.”

She laughed to herself and sauntered off, leaving the faint scent of her cocoa butter lotion.

The day dragged on like it always did. Coffee. Data entry. Boring emails. Then more spreadsheets. But sometime around noon, the power flickered. The monitors blinked. The lights overhead dimmed for a heartbeat.

No one said anything. Everyone just froze for a moment. A few of us glanced around the low ceiling and suffocated claustrophobic walls around us, eyes darting around. After a minute or two of eerie stillness, the murmurs and mutterings between friends and coworkers continued as people resumed their calls and activities.

Eight hours later, my shift ended, and I went over to my locker in the common area where you had to surrender your belongings before being let into the facility. I took out my bag and changed out of my work clothes into athletic wear. I immediately hit the streets and began my two-mile walk; I wanted to get home before sunset.

As I proceeded down the street, I walked up a rather steep ramp that had a view of both the overpass, along with the beach and the green hills just below the horizon. As I passed by one intersection, my eyes twitched slightly at the sight of what I was seeing as my eyes scanned the horizon below. The homeless camps looked as if they were bunched further together, as if they were somehow being pushed together.

It was subtle. The kind of change you'd only notice if you saw the place every day like I did. Tents that once stood apart now pressed shoulder to shoulder, like frightened animals. And where there had once been trash fires and voices, there was now silence and smoke that curled in tight spirals.

I stopped walking. Something about it gnawed at the back of my brain. Then the ground beneath me *twitched*.

Not a quake. Not the full-body shake of tectonic plates rubbing together. This was sharper. Quicker. Like something huge had just *moved* underneath the concrete—shifted its weight and went still again.

I looked around. A few cars passed by on the overpass above, indifferent. A cyclist swerved wide to avoid a pothole and didn’t even flinch. I rubbed my eyes. Maybe I was tired. Maybe my brain was trying to make sense of the caffeine crash and the flickering lights from earlier.

As I kept walking, the sky was melted into a deep orange, then red, the kind of sunset that looked like the world had been dipped in fire. Shadows stretched out in strange ways—longer than they should’ve, curling and jagged, bending against the grain of the buildings.

I treaded up the sidewalk, the soles of my sneakers tapping softly against the cracked concrete. The sun had nearly dipped behind the hills, bleeding amber and violet across the sky like bruises. The air smelled faintly of salt, sweat, and ozone.

And once more—I saw her. The Hispanic woman from the gym.

She was coming down the slope toward the apartment complex, her hands lightly gripping the handles of a black stroller. Her infant daughter was bundled inside, tiny fists rising and falling as she dozed.

She wore yoga shorts and a fitted sports bra, her figure lean and powerful, like someone who worked hard for her peace. Her long dark hair was braided into two tight plaits, and her skin glowed golden in the dying light.

She tilted her head just a little, and her mouth curved into a warm, quiet smile. A genuine one. The kind that felt like it didn’t get used enough but hadn’t forgotten how.

“Hey,” she said softly, her smile brightening.

“H-Hey,” I stammered, nearly tripping on a raised section of sidewalk.

“Just getting back from work?” she asked.

I nodded. Too hard. “Yeah.”

She didn’t flinch at my awkwardness. Didn’t look away.

“How was your day?”

I forced a smile. Tried to hold myself together like I hadn’t been unraveling all day.

“It was… predictable, I guess.”

She let out a small laugh. It was light and real and made something flicker in my chest I didn’t want to name.

“Predictable means stable,” she said with a ghost of a smile tugging at her lips.

“I-I-I…” I rubbed the back of my neck, heat crawling into my cheeks. Jesus. Me and my neurodivergent slow brain. Hesitating, flailing, stammering like a car with octagon wheels,

She tilted her head again, studying me. Not with judgment, but curiosity. Like she was waiting for me to catch up to myself.

“I should get going,” I said. I didn’t mean it, not really. I just didn’t know how to handle standing in front of a woman who looked like she walked off the cover of Vogue and spoke to me like I was worth her time. But instead of brushing it off or saying goodnight, she looked at me and asked looking up at me with a pouty lip and puppy eyes: “Do you want to walk with me?”

I blinked. The baby stirred slightly in the stroller.

My brain tripped over itself, repeating old advice: *Don’t date single moms. It’s complicated. You’re not ready. She’s out of your league.*

Then, the voice that had been whispering in my ear for months—*You’re broken, no one wants you, you’re not enough*—suddenly fell silent.

“...S-sure,” I said.

Her smile returned, cheekbones pressed higher on her face. She turned, and I fell in beside her.

The sidewalk curved gently toward the complex, and as we walked, I noticed how quiet the evening was. No dogs barking. No traffic. No laughter from the playground up the block. Just the crunch of gravel beneath our feet, and the low creak of the stroller wheels.

“So… what do you do?” she asked.

“I’m in accounting,” I said. “At a call center. Not glamorous. What about you?”

“I work full time at a warehouse. I’m a supervisor.” she said.

I nodded. “You seem like you’re… good at it.”

“I try.” She looked down at her daughter with a quiet affection. “She’s my ‘why.’”

There was a silence after that, but not a bad one. A soft one.

Then, just as we reached the gate of the complex, the ground beneath us gave a sudden, short *jolt*. The stroller’s wheels bounced slightly. I reached out instinctively, steadying it before it could tip.

Her eyes darted to me. “Another one?”

“Yeah…” I said slowly. “Felt that one under my feet.”

“That’s the third time this week.”

“It’s weird. Doesn’t feel like earthquakes. More like… movement.”

We both turned and looked back toward the hill, toward the horizon where the last sliver of sun dipped beneath the horizon.

And for just a second, I thought I saw something *shift* in the asphalt far up the road. Like the street itself had *breathed*. Her hand tightened slightly on the stroller.

We sat on an old wooden bench near the entrance to the apartment courtyard, just beyond the iron gate that never quite latched right. The stroller was parked beside us, the baby asleep and swaddled in a soft yellow blanket, her breathing slow and even.

The air had cooled just enough to raise goosebumps, the pavement still radiating the day's heat in long, tired exhales. Above us, the sky had gone a shade darker, stars struggling to break through the haze of city light. She leaned back on the bench, braids falling over her shoulders. She then tilted her face to the sky like someone trying to remember what peace felt like.

“My name’s Rosa,”

“Martin.”

She let off a light toothy smile.

I tilted my head and asked. “Where are you from?”

“I’m from El Salvador,” she began. “My family… they weren’t safe.”

I sat still, letting her speak, Tilting my head slightly.

“My cousin was murdered when I was seventeen. Shot in front of our house by some gang guys. I think it was a message. Something about turf. No one ever explained it, not really.”

My eyes widened slightly.

“A man offered to get me out. Said he would sponsor me. That I could send money home. He made it sound like salvation.”

“But when I got here,” Her lips pursed, and her voice got heavy. “It wasn’t long before they started shuttling me around to various hotels around California. They drugged me, tattooed me, beat me.” I could see the tears coming down her cheeks.

I tilted my head as a breeze moved through the park. The leaves rustled just slightly.

“His name was Diego. He’s MS-13. A shot-caller, I think. Women were like currency to him.” She then looked down at her stroller. “I got pregnant, and he got worse. Possessive. Violent. I left when I was seven months in. Hid in a homeless shelter for weeks.”

I held a hand to my mouth. “God.”

She took a breath, steadied herself. “They helped me file for something called a T visa. For survivors of trafficking. I had to tell them everything. About Diego. About the others. I still get calls from law enforcement sometimes, asking for more names.”

I just stared at her. I didn’t say a word. I didn’t know much about immigration laws. I just knew that many of the workers at the call center spoke broken English and I’m highly confident many were not here legally.

“Those let you stay for four years. After three, you can apply for permanent residency if you’ve cooperated and stayed clean?” I asked.

She nodded. “That, and my daughter was born here.”

Another silence passed, this one thicker. Then she turned her gaze to me. “What about you?”

I shifted on the bench. “What about me?”

“What are *you* running from?”

I frowned and furrowed my eyebrows. “Her name was Claudia. She… she said a lot of things. Most of them stuck.”

I stared down at my hands. The words came slowly in a tone that was laced with both sorrow and grief. “She’d call me names. Said I was broken. That I wasn’t enough. That no one would ever want me. Said I was too weird. Too robotic. That my voice made her want to scream. She used to make fun of the way I stim. Or the way I go quiet when there’s too much noise.”

Rosa’s jaw dropped slightly.

“She said I was on the spectrum and that no one would love someone like that. Like me.”

Rosa tilted her head, raising an eyebrow. “L-like you? On the spectrum?”

I let off a deep sigh. “I’m … on the spectrum.”

“That explains a few things. So let me guess, she weaponized it?” Rosa said, her voice a blade.

“Yeah. But I thought it was love, so I stayed. I kept trying to be better. Quieter. Less… me.”

Rosa reached out and touched my hand. Her fingers were rough with calluses but gentle. I looked over to her and we locked eyes. She wore no makeup, eyeliner, or blush, not that she needed it. God, this woman was gorgeous. I just stared at her, feeling her hand on mine. I then placed my hand on hers. Rosa’s smile grew wide and glistening.

The ground beneath us tremored slightly. We both looked around frantically. Rosa held onto the stroller a little more tightly.

I shook my head. “I'm no geologist, but that didn’t feel like an earthquake.”

She took her hand off mine and held it to her head. “I-I have a lot of laundry to do. I need to get going. Ill see you later!”

“Hey wait!”

She looked back at me, grip maintained on the stroller.

“I actually have laundry to do to. Would it be okay if…” I struggled to get the words out.

Her frown quickly turned into a smirk. “Join me? While doing laundry?” she then laughed.

I felt my cheeks flush. “Forget it. It was a dumb ques-”

“No, it’s okay. It can get pretty lonely at the laundromat. I could use the company.” She said with a glistening grin.

Later that evening, we both went to the laundromat. We both had a large stack of clothes we needed to take care of. The TV in the complex laundromat window glowed blue through the entire room. We were both loading up laundry into the machine.

Just then, a breaking news banner crawled across the bottom of the screen.

**"Violence in South L.A. linked to suspected MS-13 resurgence—multiple stabbings, one missing person, bodies found near riverbed."**

Rosa turned her attention away from the thong, and me. Her eyes locked onto the screen, her lips pressed into a thin line.

Her voice was quiet. Controlled. “They’re moving again.”

I looked at her. “You think it’s Diego?”

She didn’t answer right away. “It could be him. Or someone he knows. If he knows where I am...”

I saw it. Just for a second. The crack in her armor.

We stood there under the flickering laundromat light, the hum of bad wiring vibrating faintly in the silence. Then she turned to me, her expression different now. Measured, careful.

“Would you... feel comfortable staying with me tonight?”

My brain stuttered. “Wh-what?”

She rubbed her arm. “If you, you wouldn’t mind. Its just… so I can feel safe.”

I stood there and stared at her for what felt like hours. The memories crept inside my head like a parasitic amoeba.

“Martin?” she tilted her head. “Are you alright?”

I shook my head. “Y-yeah I’m fine. Are you sure you’re okay with that? I-I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable.”

She giggled. “I’ll be fine. I don’t bite.”

She gave a small nod and motioned toward the stairwell. We moved quietly, the creaking of the old stairs somehow louder in the dark. When we reached her apartment, she unlocked the door, nudged it open, and stepped aside for me. It was small but clean. The baby was still asleep in her stroller. Rosa gently lifted her into a small bassinet tucked in the corner of the bedroom.

“You can set your stuff down anywhere,” she said, slipping off her sandals.

I hovered awkwardly just inside the doorway, my eyes flicking to the bed. It was modest, with a thick comforter and a small lamp on the nightstand.

“Do you...” Rosa said slowly, turning toward me, “feel okay sharing the bed?”

I hesitated. “I—I’ve never done that before.”

She blinked. “You’ve never shared a bed with a girl?”

I shook my head. “I mean... I’ve dated. But I was always guilted into sleeping on the couch. She said I breathed too loud."

Rosa stared at me for a long moment, her face unreadable.

“She made me feel like a parasite,” I added quietly. “Even when I wasn’t doing anything wrong.”

She looked like she wanted to say something but didn’t. Instead, she came from the other room after setting Sofia in her crib. She climbed into her side of the bed. “There’s space,” she said, patting the spot next to her.

I stood frozen for a second longer, then moved slowly, sitting on the edge of the mattress like it might give out under me. I kicked off my shoes and lay back stiffly, arms crossed over my chest like a mummy. Rosa wrapped her arm around me, snuggling up to me closely, burying her face in my neck.

The ceiling was dim. My breath was too loud in my ears. I could feel Rosa, however, soundlessly giggling and smiling into my neck.

Then, the flashbacks came.

*“You’re just... so needy all the time, Martin. It’s exhausting.”*

*“Do you even know how to be normal? Like, just for a day?”*

*“You should be grateful someone like me even talks to you.”*

My jaw clenched. I felt like I was underwater again, drowning in the echoes.

I blinked and saw Claudia’s face in my mind, twisted with scorn. The smell of wine on her breath. The way she used to smile *after* the cruelty.

“Martin?”

Rosa’s voice pulled me back, but I didn’t answer right away.

I was still there—on that couch, arms wrapped around my knees, hoping silence would make the yelling stop.

“Martin,” she said again, softer this time. Her hand gently touched my arm. I flinched.

“Sorry.” I breathed, moving to the edge of the bed, back facing her.

“Sorry? For what?” she asked, lying towards me.

I pressed my fingers to my temples. “I-I-I-” I couldn’t get the words out.

“It’s okay. It will be okay.” She said tightening herself to me like a koala bear. “Just hold me please.”

I sighed and turned around to face her. Slowly. We lay there for a while in silence, both of us lying there, eyes closed, lights off. A distant siren echoed, and underneath it...A *low* rumble. Deep. Faint. Like something was dragging itself slowly beneath the city’s skin. Neither of us spoke. But we both heard it.

She gently pushed me onto the bed. I swallowed hard and adjusted myself accordingly. She slid next to me and clambered onto me like a koala bear, burying her face in my neck. I could feel her breathing into me as she giggled.

The next morning, the sky was chalky, bruised yellow. I gingerly let myself out the door, glancing over my shoulder at a sleeping Rosa, and then over to the nursery where baby Isabella was. I carefully walked down the uneven stairs of the apartment complex, trying not to wake the baby.

“Please come home.” I faintly heard her mutter under her breath as I left the room.

But upon traversing onto the street, my eyes set upon the streets before me, and a creeping dread settled into my gut.

The roads, tarmac and pavement before me warped like old skin, looking a lot more disjointed than they did yesterday. Cracks widened overnight, becoming jagged, dark, and *wet*. The asphalt peeled back in long, curling strips like snakeskin. Trash cans, mailboxes and other utilities lay toppled over. Their contents spilled over onto the streets or otherwise half-swallowed by shallow depressions and potholes in the ground. Pigeons, crows and other birds picked at food wrappers, then flew back into the sky. As the familiarity of my surroundings settled into my senses, a cold dread settled into my gut as the realization about my usual route fell upon me like a ten-ton anvil.

**There were sinkholes, everywhere. A lot more than yesterday.**

But three of them had appeared near the bus stop I normally passed, gaping like open mouths.  
One was filled with murky water while the other two were just dark. But the most unsettling thing about the area was that there were no signs, no cones, or indeed, the presence of very many utility workers. There was just spray paint on the concrete in orange that read “TEMP CLOSED” in a rush-job scrawl. I nevertheless resumed my walk to the call center, treading carefully along the pavement.

I arrived at the call center a half hour later.

Security gates didn’t buzz open anymore; they were just left ajar. I just walked on by. I immediately noticed the parking lot only had a fifth of the automobiles that were normally there. When I entered, the fluorescents inside flickered like the pulse of something sick. It was hot, scorching hot, like the air conditioning stopped working. It was like walking into an oversized oven.

It also felt eerie. Namely because there was no good reason to miss work or school today. There were no incoming natural disasters or orders from the state government to evacuate. Yet people were seemingly bolting without permission from anyone. I didn’t even need to swipe my badge to get in. The call center’s main lobby, normally buzzing with noise, energy and life, today was empty.

There was no receptionist. No coffee machine hum. No quiet morning chatter. Just silence.

I made my way to the second floor where most of the windows were. The overhead lights buzzed faintly. Only a few desks were occupied, scattered like survivors. Of the forty or so people who normally made up the floor, I counted **less than ten.** And close to all of them were not their usual selves. Even the loud, cheerful ones looked haunted.

I noticed one woman with pale, sunken eyes. Another woman was visibly shaking, hands wrapped around a Styrofoam cup that had long since stopped steaming as she stared mindlessly at her screen.

I passed by Mitch from sales. Normally boisterous and rowdy what being he was in sales. Always showing off sports stats. Today, he stared at his screen like it was the edge of a cliff.

“Mitch?” I asked.

He glanced up at me, then his attention went back to the screen.

“You hear about Greta?”

I shook my head.

“She saw the ground swallow a whole house. Right near her condo. She said she could hear people screaming, but there was nothing she could do. The road looked like soup. She quit. Took off last night without even a notice. She didn’t even pack her stuff.”

He turned to me, slowly. His eyes were *red*. Not just tired—bloodshot and threaded like something had broken in him.

“This place… it’s not safe anymore. Not this city. Not this building. You feel it?”

I nodded. It was becoming painfully obvious.

Later that morning, I passed by the security desk again. The guard—Camilla, a usually chipper girl—was slumped forward in her chair, watching grainy camera feeds twitch with static.

I asked her about the missing people. About the roadblocks, and the sinkholes. She didn’t answer at first. Just kept watching the feed.

Then, without looking at me, she said: “We can’t stay here.”

I blinked. “What?”

She finally looked at me. Her eyes were *too dry.* Like she hadn’t blinked in hours. She turned back to the monitors.

“Get out while you can.” She said in a low, yet unassuming voice. “Tomorrow. Preferably tonight.”

I shook my head. “The paychecks get processed tomorrow.”

She glanced over at me, expression hardened as he slowly shook his head. “Another hundred dollars doesn’t mean shit when you’re dead. I know what I’m doing. Mama lives in Nevada.”

I didn’t pay too much heed. I just went over to my desk and resumed my duties as usual. I was busy as usual. But I noticed that new work was not coming down the pipeline and into my inbox. My boss wasn’t looking over my shoulder or sending me emails like she normally did. Indeed, I haven’t run into her at all since I came in this morning.

Before I knew it, it was five. I clocked out and headed out the door. The security guard I passed earlier wasn’t there, and the building felt even more empty than this morning. It was so quiet I could hear my own voice bounce off the walls. I felt the ground below me lightly shake, but it was followed by a slithering, writhing sound. The rumbling intensified.

The lights then went out. It took me about a half a second to register that the power just went out.

I then heard loud crashing sounds coming from outside.

The automatic door was jammed, and I had to force it open. As I stepped outside into the midday sun, I came into a parking lot that was now completely empty. This was when I got the emergency alert on my phone:

UNUSUAL SEISMIC ACTIVITY DETECTED! TAKE SHELTER! EVACUATE IF POSSIBLE!

My heart fell in my chest as I witnessed the two-story building next to ours collapse into the ground, falling into a massive sinkhole. Cement crumbled inward like paper. A cloud of **dust and screams** billowed into the air. And through it – I heard it.

**The writhing, and the wet slapping. The friction of something unnatural squeezing through bedrock, coming from directly below. It had to be massive.**

I didn’t need a second invitation. I quickly made my way out of the plaza and onto the main road. I normally took an hour to get home, but I was determined to reach Rosa, so I decided to move as fast as I could.

I got another buzz on my phone. Another emergency alert? Maybe it was Rosa?! I took it out of my pocket to check for any possible updates. But I was surprised to see who it was.

“Hey! Martin? It’s Claudia. I heard the reports and wanted to know if you were doing alright! Are you still in Los Angeles? Are you alright? Are you safe? Please let me know! I worry so much about you.”

Unbelievable. It was Claudia. Now of all times she decides to reach out to me? After three months of total silence? I sighed deeply, looking down at the text, completely dumbfounded. I regardless ignored it and phoned Rosa.

She picked up—*thank God*—but she was already mid-sentence, voice frantic.

“Martin—it’s a madhouse here. I don’t know what’s happening. People are—”

*“What? Rosa, slow down—”*

“A car just sank outside. *It was just parked*, and the whole street opened like a zipper, and-”

**I then heard a scream from her end of the line.** It was a raw, **soul-ripping sound** that made my blood run cold.

“SOMETHINGS DOWN HERE! IT’S-”

The call cut off. And what followed was an eerie, unsettling silence. I shook my head and made my way onto the tarmac.

Then it burst through the road before me. Chunks of asphalt flew like thrown bricks and debris. And from the earth rose **what I could only describe as a grotesque splice of giant earthworm, tapeworm and leech.** **It was a massive, fleshy, annelid. The best image that comes to mind is that of the sandworms from Dune, the graboids from Tremors and the carnictus from King Kong**

**It was covered in slime and glistening mucus. It was as long as a charter bus. Its maw was lined with spiraling, grinding teeth. It had no eyes, just a large, gaping, open mouth aligned with razor-sharp teeth, wide enough to look like it could swallow a car whole.**

**It was writhing slowly through the air.** It reared up from the street with a screech like tearing metal, flailing about like a baby bird clamoring for food. The creature then **slid back down** into the road, tunneling **just below the next building.** The sidewalk connected to it cracked like glass.

**Then it hit me. There were little to no sinkholes at the foot of the buildings laden on solid cement. I deduced the giant worms couldn’t break through the concrete foundation.** But the **tarmac**?

The **roads**? The **sidewalks**? Or even the tarmac? **They were risky.**

I moved around the building to the side exit, across the narrow strip of cement walkway.  
**Not the road.**  At that point, I wasn’t walking anymore, I was running or otherwise jogging towards the apartment, being extra careful to avoid the more brittle and fragile parts of the road.

I was exhausted by the time I finally reached the apartment half an hour later, careful to avoid the roads and tarmac, practically sprinting from building to building.

The door was ajar, and a chill ran down my spine. Knowing what I knew about Rosa, it wasn’t like her leaving the door open like that. It was too quiet. I heard nothing coming from the apartment. No baby cries. I heard no humming either. The light was on but barely. I couldn’t see anything through the closed blinds.

The door creaked faintly as I nudged it open with my foot. Inside, the lights were dim—barely flickering from a loose ceiling fixture, casting everything in sickly yellow hues. Something wasn’t right. Of the handful of times, I’ve been here, it’s never been this eerily quiet. The fact that the door wasn’t even closed furthered my unease.

“Rosa?” I called softly.

“Martin?” Came her voice. But she didn’t sound like her sprightly self.  It was flat. Measured. Like someone reading from a script. **Her tone was off**. No trembling, no relief, no panic. The tone was far too calm considering the circumstances.

I stepped inside cautiously, trying not to make a sound on the creaking laminate floor.

She was kneeling in the living room. Rigid. Shoulders high. Her eyes met mine, wide and glassy, like a trapped animal. Her lips mouthed “you came,” but her eyes were pleading with me not to take another step forward.

That’s when I heard a gun cocking and something cold being pressed to the back of my head.

“Hands up, güero.”
