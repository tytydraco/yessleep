Every town holds its own secrets, its whispers of the strange and unexplained. From the infamous "Mothman", a humanoid entity with glowing red eyes and wings, to the dreaded "Bloody Mary". A spectral figure summoned by chanting her name before a mirror in a darkened room. Yet, this story speaks to another kind of evil, one so profound, so horrifying, that it has never dared to surface in folklore or campfire tales.

My name's Steve. I am a construction worker living in a small town nestled somewhere within the heart of the Alaskan wilderness. This story is meant as a warning. A great darkness is believed to stir deep within the mountains of the Alaskan wilderness, and awareness may be the only shield humanity has against it. And for the love of all that's good, don't go hunting it. Don't make the same mistake I did.

It all began with a sound - a dreadful, ominous tapping at the door.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I awoke to the sound of tapping. At first I thought it was a tree tapping against the window. Then my eyes adjusted to the dark, and I realized it was coming from the door opposite the room.

I glanced over to my alarm clock and saw the red numbers "12:30" glowing back at me. Midnight.

I slid out of my bedsheets and walked over to the door. I stopped, hesitated, and wrapped my fingers around its handle.

The outside hallway, just beyond my bedroom door, was as it had been before I slept. A muted stretch of of drywall and carpet leading up to the kitchen door, a vast nothingness.

"It's just the house settling" I told myself, "it's probably nothing."

I retreated to deceptive comfort of my bed, unable to go to sleep. My thoughts raced with the possibilities of what lurked behind that door, the reason for my discomfort. Could it be bears? Mountain lions? Armed thieves?

Then I was blinded by light. One moment the room was void, the next, a hairless arm was flailing around the mattress of my bed, from some unseen "shoulder" hiding behind it. I screamed.

I tried leaning over the bed to get a better look at it, but the room was once again plunged into darkness.

I turned on the overhead light to see if it was still there, but there was no sign of it.

After what felt like hours, I finally drifted off to sleep.

That night I dreamt of a giant face, with wide yellow eyes and razor sharp teeth, dragging me into its hole-like mouth with pink, fleshy fingers.

Just as my body was about to fall into its deep, dark mouth, I woke up.

The sunlight gleamed through the window like a beacon of safety in this otherwise treacherous house.

The day was pretty uneventful. I worked around the house, eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner without any trouble from anyone or anything.

Then the last rays of sunshine dipped over the horizon. My only line of safety, now gone.

"Here we go again" I said through gritted teeth.

It was going to come back tonight, I could sense it. The tension in the air was palpable. But now I was determined to find out what this thing was, and end it once and for all.
