Almost two years ago, I made a post here about [a book I found online.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13t3q7a/the_book_with_only_one_rule/) About a week after I posted that, I started looking for a roommate to help with rent, and found one within the month. Nice guy, didn't even question why I kept the study locked, he just chalked it up to superstition.

I ended up locking the book in my study and never touched it, or that room again. I didn't want anything to do with it. I kept hearing that steady tapping on my bedroom window. It's been going on for two years now, and not one night did I find solace from it, but it just became part of my routine. It just became the white noise I fell asleep too. I never looked outside at night. I never turned on the light. I always kept the curtains drawn.

u/Traditional-Tell1089 encouraged me in one of the comments on the original post to research the book, what happened to people that did read it. Of course, I ignored that comment. I tried to move on with my life. There's no point engaging with whatever this... thing is. They begged for part 2, but I had absolutely no intent on writing a part 2.

And yet, here we are. Recently, my roommate moved out because he found a better job in a town over. There was some stuff in my study that belonged to him, so we had to unlock the room to get it. The room was filled with dust, cobwebs, spiders, and so on. It was clear this room had been abandoned for a while. I figured that I'd clean it while we were in here, find some other place to lock the book so I could actually use this room again.

And that was my first mistake. While cleaning out the room, I picked up the book. I don't know why, but curiosity got the better of me. I flipped it open again, and a chill ran down my spine. I froze in place, trying, failing to rationalize what I just read.

If you read the first post, you'll know the single rule, on the first blank page. And yet, it was no longer there. It was scribbled out, and beneath it, written in scraggly letters from a black pen, was the following;

"In memory of the damned. Remember always one simple rule, your name is among them."

I was infuriated. I got in a fight with my roommate. I thought this was some sick joke, he found the book, put two and two together, and tried to prank me in some twisted sense of humor. He denied it, of course, I didn't believe him. I left the book on the desk and went on a walk to a local hardware store. To calm down, clear my head, whatever you want to call it.

This time it wasn't just a walk for the sake of it, though. I had a goal. I bought a small safe from the hardware store and brought it back home. My roommate and I cleared up the misunderstanding, even though some part of me still wants to believe that he was responsible. I know he wasn't. I locked the book in the safe and set it in the corner of the room, covering it with a duvet. Out of sight, out of mind, right?

Over the next few days, things repeated as normal. Tapping at my window when I try to fall asleep, wake up the next day, breakfast with the roommate, go to work, get back, play a few games, go to bed. Rinse and repeat.

Almost a week ago now he moved out. The tapping continued. In fact, it got worse, I started hearing this grating scratching noise every night. It kept me up. I couldn't sleep. I felt like I was going insane.

For some reason, I went back through my post history one night as I tried to ignore the scratching. I found the first post, I read the comments, and I figured it couldn't hurt to follow Trad's advice.

I went to my study, I caught a glimpse of a dark, shadowy figure, almost human, but not quite, out of the window. As I turned on the light, it vanished. I quickly drew the curtains and turned on my computer. And then it started again. Scratch, tap, scratch, tap. I tried my best to ignore it as I researched the book. I tried the title, I tried the writer, every single term I could thing of that even remotely related to this book, I tried. And the result was similar every time. [Nothing.](https://i.imgur.com/M0j8FUe.png)

Having exhausted every possibility I could think of, I tried searching 'books that are haunted', and this gave me a lot of results. I went through sites upon sites, searching for this particular book. And again, nothing.

Until I found an article on page 4, [Cursed Books You Should Read at Your Own Risk.](https://puzzleboxhorror.com/cursed-books/)

And there it was, the last one on the list. There was a small blurb along with reports to several incidents involving this book, and I went down the rabbit hole.


Adding to the enigmatic nature of the codex, the supposed author, a figure known only as [Redacted], is said to be long dead, although some accounts claim he never even existed. Despite extensive searches, no obituary records for [Redacted] have ever surfaced, leaving his very existence an enduring mystery. The pictured version, a disturbingly ornate facsimile, can reportedly be found on certain obscure online marketplaces.

The reports are as follows:

Elias Thorne, a reclusive bibliophile, was discovered dead in his study, his body bearing deep claw marks. Neighbors reported an unearthly, wolf-like howl just before his screams abruptly ceased, leaving a chilling silence and the lingering scent of ozone. He'd been utterly consumed by a newly acquired copy of the [Redacted], often reading late into the night.

The acclaimed historian, Dr. Cody Thorne, met a grim end in his locked apartment, his demise tragically mirroring that of his brother, Elias. A jagged claw mark was found carved into the wall beside his research notes, and the only sound witnesses recalled was a terrifying, guttural howl that echoed through the building. He had openly scoffed at the "superstitious" warnings surrounding his brother's obsession, only to fall prey to the very same unseen predator after acquiring his own copy of the [Redacted].

Isolde Vance, a young, eager occult enthusiast, was discovered lifeless in her dusty attic, her last moments marked by profound terror. Forensic teams noted inexplicable, deeply scored claw marks on her person, and emergency responders recounted a strange figure, almost like a banshee that seemed to pass through the walls. She'd been diligently documenting her unsettling experiences with a borrowed edition of the [Redacted], convinced she could control its malevolent power, often describing strange sensations preceding her demise.

Professor Alistair Finch, a distinguished expert in ancient languages, was found brutally dismembered in his university office, surrounded by open, archaic texts. Campus security reported a spine-chilling howl piercing the night just before the gruesome discovery, and strange, deep claw marks marred his sturdy oak door. He had been meticulously translating what he believed to be the long-lost original preface to the [Redacted], often expressing a growing unease about the text's contents.

Clara Jenkins, an aspiring investigative journalist, mysteriously vanished from her home after posting increasingly frantic updates about her deep dive into the [Redacted]. Her last digital entry, chillingly brief, spoke of "shadows moving in the periphery" and "a distant, hungry howl." Only her digital tablet remained, claw marks drawn across a cracked screen.

Lena Petrova, an antique dealer specializing in esoteric items, was found slumped over her shop counter, her eyes wide with frozen terror. Deep, unnatural claw marks were embedded into the antique wood around her, and police noted a pervasive, sickening scent of decay. A customer swore they heard a single, bloodcurdling howl just moments before discovering her. She'd been excitedly showing off a "new acquisition" to a friend just hours before her death, an item strongly believed to be the [Redacted].

Detective Inspector Ben Carter, a seasoned and notoriously skeptical officer, was found dead in his home, his demise seemingly linked to his intensive investigation into the bizarre deaths plaguing Glasgow, Montana. His body bore the familiar, deeply unsettling claw marks, and his frantic last call to dispatch was abruptly cut short by a horrifying, howl, leaving only static. He had been meticulously compiling a confidential file on what he internally termed the "Thorne-Vance disappearances," all of which were chillingly linked by the presence of the [Redacted], drawing him into its deadly orbit.

Marcus Finch, a struggling online bookseller, was discovered in his apartment, his throat savagely torn out with claw marks. A neighbor reported hearing a distinct, predatory wolf's howl moments before a blood-curdling scream. When they went to investigate, they found him dead at his desk, the computer still open to a confirmed listing.

The most unsettling part of all of these occurrences is that they were stories in the book. The fifth chapter in the book was written as a horror story about a strange, savage wolf-like shadow hunting people in the town of Glasgow. The book, of course, wasn't mentioned in these stories, but all of these names, and events, lined up.

Before I could read anymore, a streak of scratch marks appeared on my screen, as if something invisible was clawing it from the top to the bottom. It cracked with every inch, and my computer flickered out. I tried turning it on, no luck.

At this point I wasn't playing games. I wasn't even going to try to fix it. I left the study and locked it again. As soon as I did so, I started hearing knocking from the other side, and what sounded like a child screaming for help. Begging to be let out.

I hesitated, but I was alone now. There was no child here, this was a trick, so I left. And I mean that in every sense of the word. I grabbed a few important items, some clothes, some canned food. Only the necessities and my phone and laptop, packed up a suitcase and walked to the local bus stop.

Around eleven PM, a bus pulled up. I boarded it and found only two other people, aside from the driver. A man in a black suit sitting near the front, and an old lady at the back of the bus. I went to sit next to the old woman. I heard the tapping on the window behind me, followed by that scratching. I didn't turn around, I knew what it was.

The old woman turned to me and asked if I've been hearing the wolves at night. That terrified me, but I tried to shake it off. This last stop of this bus is just outside town. I'm writing this as a way to distract myself while I get there. Once I reach the edge of town, I'm going to hike to a friend's place, probably gonna crash there until I figure something out. The book is still in the safe at my old place. I hope it stays there.

Whatever happens, don't buy the book listed below the Lesser Key of Solomon. In fact, I'd advise even going to that site. Please, stay safe out there. Whatever this is, it isn't friendly.
