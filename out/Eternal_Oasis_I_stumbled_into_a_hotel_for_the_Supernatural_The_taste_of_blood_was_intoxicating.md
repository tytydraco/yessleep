I've had weird dreams before, but ever since stumbling into Eternal Oasis, they had grown increasingly strange. 

This was one of those times. 

Ever since moving into the master bedroom, an ancient suite converted into a more modern aesthetic, I had been plagued with nightmares. But it wasn't the "clawing at the walls" kind, like back at my dorm. I wasn't sure what had caused it. Maybe it was the parade of strangers who had saved me from certain death, or hey, maybe the place was haunted. I have never felt much of anything in my dreams, except fear. But this was different. It felt… Strangely intimate. It didn't feel like me; like my feelings. It was someone else's. 

I can't put into words what experiencing someone else's feelings is like. It's like being a parasite in someone else's mind, a buzzing, unwanted thing latched to the meat of their brain. And it's not like I wanted to stay there, trapped, glued to someone else's consciousness. Someone else's emotions, memories, and emotional memories. Their likes, dislikes, hopes and dreams. No. I wanted out. But it's not like I could retract myself. I didn't have a self.

I just existed as a lingering thought, entwined with a stranger. 

People have spoken of out-of-body experiences, but this was full throttle catapulted out of my body, and thrust, forced, into someone else's. 

The dream started hazy, like I was flying. There was an odd sensation that I'd never felt before. Like riding a wave that never fell, only rising and rising… and rising… until… 

Warmth.

It was all-encompassing, drowning my mind until my brain was on fire. Everything was on fire. It felt like an addiction. Nicotine, with maybe a smidge of dark chocolate— rich and fragrant and bitterly sweet. But then something else crept up on me, something oddly reminiscent of sweat? I'd smelled this before. I’d sprayed my dorm room to chase the stale scent away… Sex. But it wasn't just the smell. It was the feeling. 

The feeling of fingernails on skin, flushed and feral, a carnal desire so strong that it was suffocating. It was the feeling of that rising wave burning hotter and hotter, until it bloomed across my skin. This wasn't sex that was supposed to be good though. I could sense it in heavy breaths and a tight chest, a raw throat, and lips craving something much, much better. The desperation for something I couldn’t quite grasp blossoming and unfurling deep within me.

It was sad, and lame, and over in barely a few minutes. In that minute, however, I felt him. I felt the sting at the back of his throat as he held back a breath, and then… Released it. By the time they were finished, the girl lying beneath him didn't even offer a cigarette, her own lips perched around one, puffing the smoke in his face instead. It was almost like she was mocking him. When he finally tugged on his pants, his hand came out to snatch up a damp twenty dollar note. 

"That's it?" His voice was a croak, rough, almost a whine, the curl of his Australian accent slipping out. He got no reply. She just wrapped the blankets around herself, groaning into her privilege-scented pillows, and shooed him off like he was some stray cat.

So, he left, slamming the door a little too hard, and a little too loud and a little too angry. Bitch. The house was the kind he'd always wanted; a modern apartment sitting on the top of a skyscraper that his mangy ass wasn't allowed two steps in front of. 

So, I'm going to explain this the best way I know how. This guy was in my head. Or I was in his. Either way, I had just witnessed and felt exactly what he had. And from that point on, I got to know the stranger in my head, but with that came the realization that this wasn’t a stranger at all. 

In fact, he was one of the people residing in the hotel with me, and I didn’t know what scared me worse. The fact that I could see his past, or the fact that I was in his present. His past was black and white, a blur of nothing. When there was color, it came in the form of quick highs—and even those colors were muted and dim. 

The guy was a street kid, and had been alone since he was 17, so despite being in his early twenties, he was almost as naive as a teenager. But most of that was hope. Hope that he would actually get a roof over his head. Hope that he'd get a warm meal, and fuck, hope that someone in this cruel, shitty world, actually gave a semblance of a damn about him. So, when the suited man quite literally appeared out of nowhere on sketch alley, peeking into his makeshift home, he wondered if this was the moment his life would finally turn around. 

Yeah, he found himself saying that phrase a lot. 

*Sure, mum left us, and dad was an asshole, but it'll get better, right?*

*Sure, dad won't text me back and has locked me out of the house, but it'll get better, right?*

So, sticking his head out of the flap in his tent, and peering at the suited man, he expected either his life to come to an end at the mercy of a psychopath, or an Uber Eats for a personal high. Like heroin. For now, Conrad’s only solace were drugs, and heroin was his drug of choice. The warm, tingling ecstasy that he experienced when that needle found a vein, the drug seeping in and exploding in his system, was a pleasure that was indescribable. 

Oftentimes, he would just lay there, eyes glossy, staring up at the ceiling and smiling. This was one of the few times he was happy. In fact, there were only a few times when he wasn’t using drugs. And when he wasn’t partaking in one escape, he was partaking in another.

The afterglow following a night with someone who's name never left his lips gave him a different type of euphoria. It wasn’t quite like heroin, but it was his own personal drug. Something he always had access to. 

Conrad had never been interested in their names– only that they were a good enough fuck. He never looked at their faces, either. That was far too personal, and feeling alone was almost as bad as the withdrawal he felt when he wasn’t high. When he was high, the evening went by in a vaporwave, and it was almost enjoyable, until he realized that he was doing this to survive. Until he realized that he was a prisoner within his own skin.

"Hello." The man's smile was friendly enough, though the boy couldn't stop staring at his suit, and wondering how warm it was. He had been shivering in the same thin shirt for who knew how long, and he’d been actively looking for a coat; whether that was stealing one off of someone's back, or a clothing store—he didn't know. 

When the suited man, who appeared to be his dad's age, maybe a little older, with graying hair and slight stubble, leaned closer to him, rocking back and forth on the heels of expensive leather shoes, the boy couldn't resist leaning away from the stink that caused him such a visceral reaction. 

What was that? It smelled like chlorine, or maybe bleach. Whatever it was, it burned his nose, causing him to wrinkle it up in disgust.

"Urgh, are you makin' meth or something?" He was well aware of just how sketchy this whole situation was, but he was just happy to have a cigarette comfortably sandwiched between his lips.

"No," the man chuckled. "I'm actually a professor at Westwood College of Science and Research." He pulled out a nametag, and sure enough, there was his ID. 

"And… Why should I care?" He didn't mean to be rude, but his body was tired, and if he didn't sleep soon, the rain would keep him up all night. 

The man's smile didn't falter. "What is your name, young man?"

‘*Ooh, a Brit?’* Now that the man was talking louder, he detected a slight accent. His –our– lips curved into a smirk. 

So many jokes in his hazy mind, but none of them would come to fruition. The guy's teeth were actually pretty perfect, very Hollywood. So, not like the stereotypes. Too many teeth, though. Like a shark was grinning at him. *‘All the better to eat you with, my dear.’ *

‘*Wait, fuck.’* His thoughts whirled, and he took the time to inhale the sticky, toxic nicotine right into his lungs. ‘*Wrong movie.’*

He was thinking of Shark Tale. 

"Conrad," he said through a plume of smoke. "You ain't gonna steal my liver, are you? Because mine isn't any shit you'd want."

The man looked mildly horrified, before shaking his head. "No, it's a… project I'm working on. That I'm currently writing a paper on…" he started, his gaze flashing over to the needle sticking out of Conrad's pillow before saying, "the effects of drugs and opioids on our youth." The man straightened his suit jacket, studying the boy with an amused grin.

Conrad didn't feel embarrassed though. He stopped feeling things like embarrassment, along with pride, which disappeared a few months ago, right around the time that he started having to sell his body to buy drugs. 

"I'm intrigued," he murmured. "So, what, you're taking street kids from their crack dens, to… what?" He smirked. "Rehabilitate them? Save them from the big, bad world?" Conrad couldn't resist a scoff, but I felt the burn, the pain in his chest. ‘*Oh, now they wanted to give a fuck?’*

"Some could call it rehabilitation," the suited man hummed. "However, I call it a fresh start, a home cooked meal, and a chance to provide me with data. I like to think of myself as helping children in need, while also collecting much needed data."

"I'm twenty three, but I'm flattered." Conrad sucked his teeth, considering it. "So, this thing, are you saying I'll be compensated?" 

The man nodded. "Of course! 100 dollars a day. Cash.” He paused. “Would you like to take me up on my offer?” He shoved out a hand, finally introducing himself. “Oh, and where are my manners? My name is Dr. Finn Carlisle."

He thought about it. A weirdly dressed man offering him 100 dollars to take part in a science experiment? On one hand, it was the shadiest offer he'd ever received. However, money meant drugs, and drugs meant the ability to not feel and think, to be completely, inexplicably numb for a short while. And Conrad liked those short whiles. 

So, he jumped to his feet, swaying a little, and offered the man a shaky two fingered salute. "Suuuure." His voice slurred a little. "I'll be your guinea pig, man. S'long as 'm getting compensated."

That was his first mistake that night (one of many).

He realized that having hope of an actual home cooked meal, and a chance at a fresh start was naive, when the suited man let him crash on the couch. His thoughts weaved in and out, hard to reach. His head dropped. Then so did his arms, his body following suit, slumping onto the leather couch. 

Curled up on a stranger's couch was not peaceful though, because when he tried to actually sleep, he realized that his head was spinning. Not in a good way. Conrad was used to the slow passage of time and what it felt like to be high, the feeling all too familiar. But this time was different. He was too dizzy, too tangled and mismatched and wrong. 

Whatever that man had given him was stronger than he had ever experienced. And for the first time in his life, the thought of drugs scared him. Because this one left him spiraling into a deep, dark abyss, and nothing he did would drag him out.

Conrad had briefly been scared of overdosing. 

However, when there was nobody to stop him from doing it, whether that was going too far, pricking a certain part of his body, or sleeping with the wrong people, he stopped caring. 

But these kinds of drugs did scare him, because Conrad actually slept. This time with no rain pounding on his tent, or ambience of nightlife, as well as the ice cold breeze constantly keeping him awake, no matter the season, this kind of unconsciousness was almost… Heavenly. 

Too quiet. 

Too peaceful. 

Too dark.

Too wrapped in oblivion that felt like it stretched out forever in front of him. 

It was that smell again that had pulled him from the darkness. 

Bleach, or maybe chlorine, a sickeningly sweet scent tickling the back of his nose and throat. 

Seeping back into consciousness, the first thing that grazed his ears was screaming, and his first thought was, Oh, God, not the pigeon lady, again. 

But these screams continued, shrill, and high pitched, and definitely not like the pigeon lady, who had been his daily alarm. For a moment, Conrad stayed very still and aware, quickly gathering that he was lying on a metal table. Common sense was enough for him to know his new friend had drugged him— and, yep, his organs were definitely about to go on a trip around the world. 

His hands were strapped down, and something was burning through his eyelids. Fuck, what was that? Was it the sun? He cracked open one eye, the light blinding him, and he realized that it was the artificial glow of a lamp. Conrad blinked, his vision blurring in and out of view. Where was he? 

I knew exactly where he was. 

The blanketed darkness from my nightmares, now illuminated in light, bringing life into what I thought was my own imagination. 

I had seen others die where he–we– were lying, heard them scream for mercy. 

The cries were closer now that he'd wrapped his head around reality, and when he craned his neck, scraping his back on the table he was unceremoniously bound to, he could spy another bed, occupied, and trembling from side to side. It was the blood stained sheets and pillows—as well as the head of dark red hair matted with blood, and dead eyes staring up at the ceiling. She was screaming, he thought, panic striking like bolts of lightning. 

She was dead. Conrad saw her eyes, dead, lifeless, and yet her body was jerking from side to side. That sent him twisting back around, his stomach lurching into his throat. "Doctor of medicine and science.” Conrad almost let out a sob, before sucking it back between his teeth. More like fucking Frankenstein. Fear was a weird thing. Conrad hadn't felt it in a long time. 

He was used to feeling numb. But this was actually a feeling, one that was so powerful I could feel it too. From every individual goosebump prickling on his arms, to the searing light burning his face, and the sticky bed sheets he was lying on. 

"Whahhhthe–"

The words he'd managed to culminate in the back of his throat came out in a slur, before being cut off, by a sudden intrusion, two fingers being forced between his lips. 

"Central incisor is around 10.18," a familiar voice murmured. 

It took Conrad a dizzying moment to figure out that the doctor was looming over him, his expensive looking suit replaced by powder blue scrubs, a plastic apron, and a surgical mask showing the crease of a smile he clearly wasn't trying to hide. There were slight smudges of red on the apron. Conrad's chest grew tighter, until it was hard to breathe. He tried, in through his nose, out through his mouth. But the banshee wail screeching from the person-shaped lump on the other end of the room, was twisting his gut. 

Before Conrad could cry out, or maybe bite the fucker, the man's finger slid over his back teeth. His next words were a low mumble that Conrad couldn't understand. 

"What the fuck." This time, he spoke through the fingers in his mouth, pointedly glaring at the man. "Are you doing?" His voice muffled under his curled fingers. It was all he could think at that point. All he could say. 

His body trembled, wrists quivering under velcro restraints. Instead of answering him, the man straightened up. "I thought a lot about who I would take," he said. "Of course, I considered young and healthy people." the doctor leaned forward, still with that ghost of a smile creased in his mask. "But they would be missed." 

*Ouch*. 

That stung, and the funny thing is, Conrad never realized how much he actually wanted to live. Not until this moment anyways. But none of that mattered now. He was at this psychopath’s mercy, and by the looks of it, his chances of surviving this whole thing looked slim to nothing.

"Do you know a Homovorus is?" 

Conrad thought about answering sarcastically, but fear won. "No," he said in a shuddering breath. 

The doctor chuckled. "I'm sure you have heard of them! Dracula? Nosferatu? They are creatures of folklore."

"How bout' go fuck yourself." He said through his teeth. "You're insane." 

Perched between the doctor’s fingers was a syringe filled with some kind of inky, black substance. It seemed to bubble and ooze, writhing within the confines of its plastic cage, trying to escape. Conrad's vision blurred in and out as he twisted a very large needle onto the syringe, before flicking off the cap and thumping the side of the plastic tube until the liquid calmed. Like a real mad scientist. Dexter's Laboratory. His thoughts spiralled into nonsensical squiggles. No. Worse. 

*You've gotta be kidding me,* the words thundered in his head. 

*This can't be fucking happening to me*. 

A sharp prick in his neck, and he was jerking, twitching, convulsing. 

*Hate needles.*

His thoughts collapsed into a moan boarding on a cry. *F'kin hate needles--*

A strangled scream left Conrad’s mouth as he fought against his restraints, his body jerking from left to right, rattling the table. When he lurched forwards, his mouth opening, the doctor's gloved hands planted down on his chest. But the hands weren't enough to hold him down, because his body, our body, was being ripped to shreds. And he was screaming, wailing, begging for meth, words that were on my lips. Tears that were on my cheeks. This was enough to remind me I had a body, and I existed inside my own reality. Not just his. 

I writhed within my own bed, my body twisting and tangling. I could feel sheets and pillows, my own clammy skin soaked against blankets. 

Like sleep paralysis, except I couldn't escape it. I couldn't pull away from him, a suffocated mind full of poison, pain, agony, that had become mine. All of this pain was insanity, bleeding and blurring into me so strongly, vividly, dizzily, that I wanted it to fucking kill me. It was the kind of pain, no, agony, that was all encompassing, oblivion ripping into him–into us. *Let me die.* His panicked thoughts polluted my mind, strangled and writhing, like bugs skittering down my spine. *Let me die.* 

*Let me die.*

*Let me die.*

*Let me fucking die--*

I'll never be able to describe the feeling of letting go, allowing yourself to be plunged into that incomprehensible darkness we are all terrified of. I didn't think he would. I thought he would fight back. Because it was our pain, it was our fingers desperately clinging onto an anchor, wishing, hoping, that some faceless stranger might come save him. Dad. The word popped into his mind, quickly fading when the realization of being well and truly fucking alone hit him. Nobody to stop him destroying himself, and nobody to save him from becoming a victim of Dr. Freak-en-stein.

So, letting go was easier than he–we– thought. 

It was… Relief. Like being injected with morphine. 

Relieved, breaths twisting into labored pants and desperate cries, because part of him still wanted to live. Part of him still wanted that fantasy he'd had as a high schooler, of publishing his own noir novel, and being one of those big-shot authors living in New York City. Fantasy bled into reality when he was kicked out by his father. And the real world hit him. No time for stupid dreams. Conrad had to survive. 

Surviving now, however, felt… exhausting. 

Something wet and warm dripped down his chin, and it tickled. 

He laughed, or maybe spluttered, or maybe it was both. 

Everything was slowing, so agonizingly slowly. His body, his brain, his… thoughts. 

It was like his heart was trapped in a thick sludge, the beating growing fainter and fainter until… *Nothing*. And nothing felt good. For both of us. It lasted for, I don't know. It could have been seconds, minutes, hours. Days. Weeks. Months. Years. 

Before *nothing* spat us back out. 

*Nothing* became something, and something was different. It felt different. Lighter. His body was no longer weighed down on the table. Now, he felt like he was floating, like breaking the surface after falling into the ocean. Nothing was an odd sensation in his mouth. Was his tongue bigger? No, that wasn't it. When nothing became sudden hunger, a feral urge to lurch up, and… and do what? Conrad was confused. His name was tangled in his mind, memories slowly swirling down the drain, hanging on by only a thread. 

When he opened his eyes, he was greeted by piercing blue ones staring back at him, excitement and greed twisted on thin, wrinkled lips. Huh… Conrad had failed to see just how much blood was on the floor, caked to the tiles, splattered on the walls. And underneath him. Sticking to his mouth and chin, soaking the blankets. This shade of red was new, and dazzling, and too bright for him to fully comprehend it. 

"How do you feel?" 

Conrad didn't know how to answer that question, because he didn't know who he was anymore. 

What he was.

Where he was. 

"Young man," The doctor's voice was too loud in his ears, too clear, and his fists tightened at the sound, half recoiling, his teeth gritting. He wanted it to stop. The noise. All of it. The whirring of a nearby thing that he couldn't identify, and the thump, thump, thump of something just within his reach. "How do you feel?" 

*Like I'm dying.*

*No. Like I'm dead*, he thought dizzily.

His body jerked on the table, wrists easily breaking through restraints with a simple twitch of his fingers. The sudden stink, no, aroma, slammed into him –us– and when Conrad looked up, blinking rapidly, at something hovering over his face; it was a head, a human head, a man whose eyes were still open, wide in fright. There was something trickling down the curve of his throat, a long entwining stream of bright red. The man's throat was slit all the way across, opening him up. When warm drops hit him in the face, the smell only grew increasingly stronger, until his tongue was lazy, flicking out, and lapping up the red.

Tasted like sewer water. 

Then chocolate milkshake. 

Then liquid gold, running down his throat. 

And that caused him to sit up, and slowly, like he was being taken over, poisoned by a separate entity, he was sinking his teeth into warmth, into wet flesh mulling around his mouth. The first bite was confusing, his bite was more of a nip instead, pressing his lips to that warmth, that dazzling red, that exploded in his mouth and throat, like no high ever could. I tried to retract from his mind, once again. But I was stuck. I was stuck to him, while his second bite became a third, his moans growing animalistic, feral, ripping into the rest of the head, and then the body. 

I didn't even notice him tumble off of the table, a tangle of twisted limbs crawling, forcing his body across cold tiles, fingernails sinking into the rest, and squeezing, coming together, territorial, feasting on the torso until he was satisfied, and it wasn't just his mouth that was filled with blood and mangled flesh— it was mine. Shooting up in bed, in my body, my stomach heaving violently, my mouth full of it, wet and red, and stringy something clinging from my teeth, and then splattering my bedspread when I spat it out. No matter how many times I brushed my teeth, it was there. I could fucking taste it, the metallic, coppery tinge of it glued to my throat. 

It was disgusting, mortifying, and yet because of his thoughts, his feelings entangled with mine. I couldn't help having the same thought… 

The taste of [blood](https://www.reddit.com/u/Justhegirlnextdoor?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1) was [intoxicating](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15qvhew/eternal_oasis_i_stumbled_into_a_hotel_for_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2).
