I never thought I would be the kind of person asking strangers on the internet for help, but here I am. Either someone here knows what is going on, or my wife is going to end up in a psych ward for a long time.

It started after our trip to Red River Gorge. We are both obsessed with local mythology, caves, rock formations, and weird stories people tell about the woods. We spent two days hiking trails and crawling through narrow stone passages. Nothing strange happened. At least, not yet.

On our last evening, we picked a spot to camp. There was a small clearing, blackberry bushes nearby, and a creek close enough that we could hear the water. While my wife Heather was getting dinner ready, I went to dig a bathroom hole about two hundred feet west of the camp.

That was when I noticed a small cave opening halfway up a rocky hill.

I told Heather, and she practically dropped what she was holding and followed me. She was smiling like an excited kid while we climbed inside. I lit my lighter to check the air, then we moved deeper into the cave, our footsteps echoing in the dark.

After a minute or two, she stopped and said, What is this.

Half buried in the cave wall was a glass bottle. It looked like someone had forced it into a crack in the stone. Scratched into the rock beside it was a symbol. A serpent with horns curving over its head. The bottle did not look ancient, but it definitely was not new.

Heather reached for it right away. I told her to leave it alone. Where I grew up, superstition sticks to you whether you want it to or not. But she kept wiggling it loose, laughing like it was nothing.

The bottle finally came free.

Inside were rusted nails, ash, and dried herbs I did not recognize. The back of my neck started to crawl. I told her, firmly, to put it down and leave. She rolled her eyes, but she did, and we got out of that cave as fast as we could.

Back at camp, we tried to act normal. We cooked, talked a little, and went to sleep.

At least, I did.

When sunlight hit my face in the morning, I sat up and froze. The entire tent floor was covered in dirt. Heather’s hands and feet were scraped raw, bright red, like she had been digging with them all night.

She kept saying she had been asleep. That maybe she was sleepwalking. I did not want to scare her, or myself, so we cleaned her up, packed our things, and started hiking back.

We walked in silence for a long time. Then she asked, Can we stay another night here.

I told her no. I had work the next day, and honestly I just wanted to leave. She started crying. Not sad crying. Desperate and panicked, like I was dragging her away from something she needed.

Then she said, If you are really sorry, we will stay another night.

I had to practically pull her out of the gorge.

The whole drive home, she did not say a word. When we got back, she went straight into the bedroom and locked the door. I slept on the couch.

I woke up to scratching.

Slow, constant, repeating. Then banging.

I ran to the bedroom and burst the door open.

She was curled up on the floor in the fetal position. Her hands and feet were torn open and smeared with blood. The scratches covered the inside of the door like she had been trying to claw her way through it.

I scrubbed the blood away, but the marks are carved into the wood. I took a picture because I knew no one would believe me.

When she finally looked up at me, she did not look confused.

She looked angry.

And the first thing she said was not What happened.

It was:

Why did you take me away from it.

I do not think this is sleepwalking anymore.

I am begging anyone reading this to help me. I do not have anywhere else to ask, and if I cannot figure this out soon, they are going to put her in a psych ward.
