BAM!

The impact on my bedroom door sent a jolt of adrenaline through me.



BAM!



I sat up, my heart beating hard. The door was cracked. I looked around for my phone; the dimly lit room hid all but the largest of details. There were no streetlights coming in through the windows. No passing cars.



BAM!



The door came off its hinges, splintered wood fell to the ground, and with it came a woman. I stared in shock, unable to process what was going on.



Her head snapped in my direction, and with a single leap she landed on my bed, her legs straddling me. The blankets pinned my arms to my side.



Blood-red eyes bored into me; teeth that had long since turned green spewed a vomit inducing odor into my face.



I didn’t have a chance to scream; she bit into my cheek. The disease ridden mouth leaking its slime across my defenseless head.



I felt her teeth scrape across my cheekbone, the flesh being ripped from its location. The pain was unbearable. I cried out. I struggled.



When she bit into my neck, I felt hot blood spray from the wound. My body ached as its life carrying fluid escaped one heartbeat at a time.



My consciousness began to fade.



Suddenly I felt the weight disappear, and a scream of mortal fear ripped its way out of my throat. I flopped out of my bed and onto the floor in an undignified pile of limbs and blankets.



Blinded by my own tears, I frantically looked around the well lit room. I was alone; the hum of traffic outside was as loud as ever.



Tentatively I reached up to touch my face. I winced, but I couldn’t tell if the pain was psychological or physical. I got to my feet and crossed the small room, entering the attached bathroom. I looked in the mirror.



Had it been my imagination, or had there been a mark? I looked again but saw nothing.



With my heart rate slowing and logical thought taking over, I realized it had simply been a nightmare.



My alarm blared, nearly killing me. I checked the time: 7:00 AM.



I got dressed and made my way downstairs. The couple I rented the room from were rarely around, and today was no different.



Grabbing my bike I made the short ride to college in plenty of time. My thoughts were abstract throughout the day; I couldn’t get the dream out of my mind.



A couple of my friends jokingly asked what party I had been at. By the end of the day I was drained; I felt as if I hadn’t slept in days.



Bed never felt so comfortable. Although I have to admit I did leave the bathroom light on. It’s silly, but it did make me feel a little safer.



The second time the book I was reading fell from my hands and hit me on the nose, I decided it was time to get some sleep. Leaving the light on, I rolled over and closed my eyes.



Barely had they drifted shut before I was jerked awake by a violent impact on my door.



BAM!



The room was dark; the bathroom light was off. I desperately looked around; surely I wasn’t dreaming. It was too real.



BAM!



The door cracked, and small pieces flew across the floor.



This couldn’t be happening. Was last night’s dream a premonition?



The door imploded, and a woman's form charged through it. I threw my legs out of the bed in an attempt to run. She jumped onto my back and dug her fingers deep into my skin.



I felt her nails slide under my trapezius muscles; using her newfound grip, she pulled back while shoving her knees into my spine.



I screamed and flailed my numb arms about. I fell under her weight. I sobbed as she bit pieces of my scalp and pulled them free from my skull.



It took so much longer to die this time. I woke up lying in a puddle of my own puke. I gagged on the thick, partially dried liquid. My body ached as I crawled into the shower.



I let my alarm blare as I lay under the hot water. I cried again.



Two hours late, I arrived at my college. Professors don’t care if you show up or not; they get paid either way, so it wasn’t like my absence was missed.



I floated through class. My head jerked up; the room was empty. The lights were off; a thick layer of grime covered every inch of the place.



With my heart hammering, I tentatively stood up. It was so quiet. The room felt dead, abandoned. Like years had passed since the last human had touched the place.



One careful step at a time, I made my way down the rows of chairs. The door to the hall was open a crack; I peered out.



Like the room, I stood in the hallway, which was unlit and dirty. I pushed open the door; it protested audibly, but I persisted.



The air felt gross, like it had viscous properties normally reserved for petroleum based liquids.



Taking the utmost care, I made my way through the hallway and into the main lobby. The large windows let enough light in to allow me to see the room.



Crossing the floor were footprints; the paths crisscrossed the area. Whoever had made them wasn’t wearing shoes at the time.



Suddenly the large metal door I was peeking out from behind slammed closed on my hands.



I fell backwards into the hallway, clasping my broken fingers to my chest. The pain was so intense I didn’t notice the shaggy man with red eyes until he was on top of me.



Grabbing my hair, he slammed my head into the floor. He lifted my head and brought it down again and again. Warm liquid flowed from my ears. The hard crack of my skull striking the tile was replaced with a soft squelching.



And then there was nothing.



I woke screaming in the middle of class. People scrambled to get away from me as I tumbled to the floor.



The vomit trying to escape my throat saved me from feeling the proper mortification of my actions.



Having fought through the panicked crowd, I crashed into the bathroom. Luckily I reached the toilet before my guts heaved one last time.



On my knees with my head hung over the alarmingly red porcelain bowl, I contemplated life.



I couldn’t sleep, not if the outcome was going to be this.



With my eyes squeezed shut, I rested my head against the tank. I didn’t move until I heard the slap of bare feet on tile.



Annoyed, I opened my eyes, ready to tell the person to get lost.



The smell of the brown mold-covered toilet distracted me enough to not notice the lights were out.



I froze at the realization that the entire stall was covered in stains and biological growths.



Heavy breathing came from outside the stall, like someone was forcing air through clenched teeth. The rage was a physical presence filling the room.



Simultaneously as the man lunged for my legs, I jumped onto the toilet. His nearly scalped head looked up at me for a second, his mouth cracked into a yellow smile.



I kicked at him as hard and fast as I could. Despite his attempts at grabbing my foot, I was able to drive him back out of my stall. He hesitated then immediately tried to lunge over the stall door.



Taking my chance, I shoved the door open, slamming him into the wall. He snarled like a caged animal.



Pulling back, I threw him into the wall twice more before running out of the bathroom.



Like I suspected, he was not discouraged in the least. I pushed with every ounce of strength; my sprint was nearly impressive.



Down the hall and through the lobby led me to the small private street the college was located on. I didn’t know where to go; the sound of something coming got me moving.



I didn’t have a plan, but I had hope. Running across the campus brought the attention of two more people.



Like everyone else in this world, they began to pursue me. That is until something bellowed; it sounded like that of a bull.



My pursuers froze, then ran back to the buildings. I didn’t care; I had an idea. Reaching the campus overpass, I kept going. My path took me directly over the edge. I felt weightless as my body drifted through the air.



Then there was a crunch; I barely felt it. I was on my knees leaning over a polished toilet. The lights were on, and there was a hum of humanity all around me.



I was back in my home world. I need to figure out what is happening; I have bruises appearing. Ones that I didn’t get while awake. Small cuts as well.



I’ve even noticed smells from the rotten place drifting about the real world.



I need help
