I received this message recently from a narrator:

*Dear esteemed sir,*  
*I am a humble narrator and it would be the greatest honour if you grant me permission to narrate your stories. You may peruse my Youtube page here: \[redacted\]. Kindly revert back.*

I clicked on the link. They had only one video, which had been posted yesterday. Despite their claims, they were not a narrator. They had used a computerized text-to-speech voice, and not even a good one. It was completely flat, didn’t sound remotely realistic. 

I replied with a single word: No!

A few minutes later, I received another message. 

*Dear esteemed sir,*  
*That is a most grievous mistake. I know all about technology, especially Internet Protocol Addresses (IPs). I have already geolocated your address and am prepared to take action. Please send one (1) bitcoin to the following wallet: \[redacted\]. If you do not, I will slice your throat from ear to ear while you sleep tonight. Kindly revert back.* 

I burst out laughing; this was all so absurd. Teddy, my 18-year-old younger brother, looked up from where he was texting on the couch.

  
“What’s so funny?” he asked. 

  
“Some crazy guy’s trying to scam me on Reddit,” I said. “Says he can figure out where I live from my IP address.” That notion was so ridiculous. Even if he managed to find my actual IP address, which was impossible, since I always use a VPN, he wouldn’t have anything more than a general geographic location. 

  
Teddy chuckled. “Well, better be careful, lots of crazies out there.”

  
\*\*\*

  
I didn’t respond to the message. But that evening, the ‘narrator’ had sent me another one. 

*Dear esteemed sir,*  
 *I am most upset that you didn’t kindly revert back. I am not understanding. I told you most explicitly what would happen. I have located your house, please see the color photograph attached here: \[redacted\]. If you do not do the needful within two (2) hours, I will be forced to act. Now please send two (2) bitcoins to the following address: \[redacted\].* 

I clicked on the Imgur link. To my surprise, there was a photograph of my house, probably pulled from Google Street View.

  
How had he managed to track me down? Had I written something in one of my Reddit comments that had doxxed me? I didn’t think so, I tried to be careful, but I’ve had the account for years and had made hundreds of posts. Or was it one of my friends messing with me? I was pretty sure, again not positive, but pretty sure, that no one knew my username but me. 

  
Regardless, I wasn’t scared. This was a new one, but internet scams had been around for decades. Whoever the sender was, he couldn’t do anything to me in whatever third-world country he was in. Plus, if he tried, I had a Glock 17 loaded with hollow-points in my bedside table.

That night, I woke up around 2 a.m. to some noise outside my window. Thought it was just a raccoon or some other critter, and was about to roll over and close my eyes, when the window started to open. I didn’t know how that was possible, since I always kept it locked, but I didn’t have time to try to rationalize this. 

  
My heart pounding, I turned on the lights and retrieved my handgun. A figure, wearing a hockey mask and dressed from head to toe in black, was crawling through my window, a knife in his right hand.   
I quickly aimed my gun and fired a single shot, hitting the intruder in the chest. 

  
“Please,” he cried weakly as he collapsed. 

  
I recognized that voice. I hurried over to him, knelt down, and pulled the mask off. It was Teddy, my brother. 

  
“Goddammit, Teddy!” I screamed. “How could you be so damn stupid? You knew I had a gun.” 

  
He looked up at me with his big brown eyes. “A…a…prank,” he said. 

  
“Goddammit, Teddy,” I cried. “Just stay with me, it’s all going to be okay, we’ll laugh about this, just stay with me…”

  
But his eyes had closed. There was nothing I could do. My only brother was dead.
