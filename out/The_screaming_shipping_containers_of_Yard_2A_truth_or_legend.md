Smoke rose into the crisp winter air, mixing seamlessly into the night sky. The fire that crackled beneath it, was a pitiful thing at best. The rusted barrel that housed the flickering warmth, was surrounded by vagrants. 

Drug addict, runaway, vermin, drifter, homeless, call us whatever you like. None of the terms ever hurt my feelings, since the people throwing around such words, are just afraid of ending up like us. Personally, I would say I fall into the runaway category but that’s a story for another time. 

The tips of my finger poked out through my torn gloves. As I held them over the fire I watched as they changed from blue to pink. Sensation finally returning to my hands. Every minute or so I would flip them like pancakes on a flat top grill. 

The barrel I stood around was one of many. There were about five groups of people huddling together for warmth. A few paces from where I was, two of the older men at the camp chatted candidly. They were swapping war stories over beaten up cups of instant coffee. Stifling a few laughs, I kept my head down and continued to eaves drop. A couple of the kids from the group wandered over to the old men, and begged them for a story. 


The night before last, five newcomers arrived at our camp. Those of us who had been staying here for a while, put up signs all across town. Incase there were others, others who liked safety in numbers. If the newcomers had found the signs, and made their way here? Well, shit. So long as they don’t stir up trouble, they’re more than welcome to stay. 

You’ll find it quite funny to know, that the homeless can be more territorial than a property owner. Must be the last little shreds of hope, and pride. The NEED for something to call their own. Not us though, not here. For our little community, it’s lonely out by the docks. The more, the merrier. 

-I should probably introduce myself at this point dear reader. I apologize. But as hard as I try, I cannot remember. If it comes to me later, I promise to let you know. -

“So y’all got any local legends around here?” A thick southern drawl cut through the chatter. 

I looked around to see where the voice originated from. Eventually my eyes fell upon a man sitting on top of an old cement drainage pipe. He was just past where the fire light could reach, his face shrouded in shadow. The cowboy had that rested on his head was a dead give away. No one within a hundred miles dressed, or sounded like that. 

“Local legends? Hell yeah we’ve got quite a few.” Old man Bill chuckled. “Hmmm… let’s see. We’ve got the Long Dog, poor old Witch Sarah, Dr. Drummond who started haunting the Asylum after being brutally murdered by his patients. Am I missing anything Ryan?” 

Old man Bill turned to look at me. 

-Oh yes, Ryan. That was my name.-

My brows furrowed, a sinister look forming on my face. “Yes Bill, you forgot the newest legend to hit the Riverside Bay. How could you forget? We are reminded of it every night. I started hearing rumors of it around my 15th birthday.” I sighed. 

“Have you ever been to the container yard, just after midnight?” One of the kids asked the Cowboy, who shook his head no. 

“The containers scream, just after the stroke of midnight. To top that off, there have been countless disappearances from that area.” I pointed my eyes at the Cowboy. 

He slid down off the drainage pipe and walked closer to the group. I noticed he held something in his hands as he approached. The fire light glinted off the flat of the blade. A well worn pocket knife was being used to scrape the dirt from under his nails. 

“You mean that container yard? The one right over there?” Cowboy asked whilst jerking his thumb behind him. 

“That’s the one.” I stated with a stern tone. 

“Screaming shipping containers? You’re shitting me. Sure it’s not a group of illegals sneaking across the boarder?” Cowboy asked sincerely. 

I rolled my eyes and scoffed. “What? You a racist, Cowboy? There were tons of other things you could have come up with, but you picked that? Damn.” 

“I ain’t no damn racist. It was either that or human trafficking. I chose the less morbid answer.” 

I burst out laughing, clutching at my sides. After a moment Cowboy realized I was razzing him, and relaxed. As if in cue, the wind began to howl. I watched as the groups mood suddenly darkened. I grinned largely under the cover of darkness. 

“Wanna go check it out for yourself if you don’t believe me?” I raised an eyebrow at Cowboy. 

“Even if he doesn’t go, he’ll still be able to hear it from here.” Lou grunted as he brushed past me. He was the man Old Bill hung around with most. “It’ll be midnight soon enough. Better tuck in kids.” 

As Lou and Bill wrangled the group into their tents, Cowboy and I wandered to the edge of camp. The heels of his cowboy boots clicked softly against the frozen ground. If we took a few more paces, we would eventually leave the forest and be met with a barbed wire fence. Behind it, were stacks and stack of shipping containers that seemed to go on infinitely. 

The wind-

-it always starts with the wind. It always starts with the wind. It always starts with the wind. It always starts with the wind. It always starts with the wind it always starts with the wind it always starts with the wind it always starts with the wind 
It 
Always 
Starts 
With 
The 
Wind
It-

Began to pick up as Cowboy and I approached the humming fence. The sound that emanated from the yard was something too harsh to describe. I can only provide meager comparisons. You’ll have to let your imagination do the rest. 

The screaming starts off like the wind whipping through bare branches. A low, painful howl that sends shivers down your spine. It’s never just the moaning though. It always ALWAYS escalates into feverish shrieks. Like pigs squealing in a slaughterhouse, or the high pitched scraping of metal on metal. The screams sound guttural, and wet. Like trying to wail for help whilst being held under water. 

But, as quickly as it starts, it fades even quicker. Into soft cries that are carried away on the invisible breeze. 

“The FUCK was that?” Cowboy asked, his breath coming in pants. His eyes were practically bulging out of his head. 

“That’s them, the screaming shipping containers of Yard 2A.” 

As Cowboy turned his back to me, a slow smile crept its way across my face.
