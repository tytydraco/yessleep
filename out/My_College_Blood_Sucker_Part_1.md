When I first started college, I had an idea that things could probably get a little weird. You've all probably heard one of those weird college stories your parents or your drunk uncle used to talk about when they were in college.

Let's just say this story takes the cake.

It was the start of my first year in college when I first stepped into my room in the dorm. Immediately, I was greeted by possibly the friendliest voice I've ever heard.

"Hey there!" Came the voice of a girl who was already in the room. "Looks like we're going to be roomies!"

I set my stuff on my bed and turned to her, giving her a nod before a began taking my stuff out.

"Uh uh," I heard her say before I felt her hands on my shoulders. I was suddenly turned around to face her sickeningly sweet smile. "You're not just gonna give me a nod and call it a day. What's your name?"

I gave an amused chuckle before answering, "Doni."

Her smile turned into a grin, "Love it! I'm Amora."

I was about to respond when I noticed something. Amora's eyes were red. Like, blood red. I'm not talking about from crying or anything like that. It was her normal eye color.

I began to speak. "Your-"

"Eyes?" She responded as if she knew right away what I was going to say. She giggled. "Yeah, I guess they are kinda strange, aren't they? Well, I wouldn't have it any other way. They add more uniqueness to me." She then leaned closer and whispered, "Plus it can be fun to scary certain people with them."

That last part made me smirk. "I like you," I told her.

"The feeling's mutual," Amora replied. "We're gonna have a great time together!"

"I'm sure we are," I said. "But for right now I really should unpack my stuff."

"Oh totally!" Amora agreed. "I gotta finish unpacking mine too. I just wanted to greet you before I did."

The two of us spent the next while unpacking our things and setting them where they needed to go. After that,  Amora asked me if I wanted to go and get a bite to eat. I jokingly told her I would only go with her if she was paying. She laughed and said that it was no problem.

I guessed she was one of those girls whose parents have a lot of money. But she was cool so it wasn't a problem for me. We went and decided to split a big pepperoni pizza. It was probably the best pizza I've ever had in my life.

We spent that time getting to know each other and talking about what our lives were like before we got here. Something I noticed during this was that I was kinda talking more about myself and Amora seemed to be dodging certain questions. I figured it was just some stuff that she wasn't ready to share with me yet. We did just meet after all.

We started walking back to campus when we were done. It was dark out and there wasn't anyone else around but us after some time.

Or so I thought.

I noticed that Amora was looking back suspiciously every few seconds. 

"What's up?" I asked.

"Nothing," Amora smiled at me. "Just keep walking."

I wasn't someone who was easily fooled by an answer like that. When someone was acting the way Amora was I knew something was wrong.

I turned around and saw someone in a hood walking behind us. Amora quickly turned me around.

"Don't worry about it," She said. "I've got my eye on them."

"Who is that?" I asked. "Someone kind of stalker of yours?"

"It's just-" She looked back again. "I'll tell you when we get back to our room."

That answer didn't satisfy me. I wasn't about to just keep walking while being followed by some weirdo and act like nothing was going on.

I reached into my pocket for the knife I always carried with me. You never know when something like this will happen so I say it's always good to have some form of protection with her.

After taking it out, I turned to the hooded figure, a serious look on my face as I said, "Who the hell are you?"

The figure just stopped. No movement whatsoever. They just stood perfectly still. They titled their head. I couldn't see their face so I couldn't tell the expression they had.

If I had to guess, they were probably studying us.

Then, they finally moved their hand to pull something out. It was some kind of device that was beeping.

They then pulled something else out. It was some kind of gun.

"You didn't think it would be that easy to avoid the following, did you?" The figure asked. It was a man. Or at least I thought it was a man.

As he moved closer I got a good look at his face. Like Amora's, his eyes were red. But there was something else about him.

He had fangs. Like vampire fangs. Not those fake ones you could buy, I'm talking about the real deal.

Before I could even act, Amora jumped and attacked the man. He gave one shot that went into the air.

She punched him in the face multiple times. She then pulled some out of her pocket. It was a knife of her own, but it didn't look like one I'd ever seen. She stabbed it right into the man's chest before I saw that she had fangs too.

"What the fuck!" I let out before she bites straight into the man's neck. I watch in absolute shock as pull comes out of the man. It didn't get the chance to reach the ground before Amora drank it up.

When it was over. Amora stood up and looked at me. That sickeningly sweet smile of hers returned.

She wrapped an arm around me as she began walking me back to our room. She then said, "Interesting first day as roomies, huh?"
