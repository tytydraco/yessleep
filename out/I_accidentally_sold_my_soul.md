When I was twelve years old, I had a friend whose fascination with the devil became a consuming obsession. She frequently claimed she had sold her soul to him, and while her declarations unsettled me, they also intrigued me. It felt like she wielded a power over her own narrative, akin to a character from a story I had yet to fully decipher. One day, she brought an Ouija board to school, convinced that it would be our gateway to the supernatural realm. Her excitement was infectious, and I found myself swept up in the idea of connecting with something beyond our ordinary lives.

We decided to sneak into a dimly lit bathroom during lunch, our hearts racing with the thrill of secrecy. The peeling paint on the walls and flickering overhead lights created an atmosphere ripe for a supernatural encounter. Once inside, we turned off all the lights, enveloping ourselves in a thick blanket of darkness. Armed with only the faintest glow from the stray light peeking through the cracks, we placed our fingers lightly on the planchette, its wood cold beneath our touch.

At first, as we attempted to summon spirits, nothing significant happened. My skepticism began to rise; I couldn’t shake the feeling that my friend was somehow manipulating the planchette, moving it ever so slightly under the guise of a spirit's influence. However, the air around us felt charged, electric with anticipation, like static before a storm.

As we continued, I stole a glance into the shadows, and my heart almost stopped. There, amidst the thick veil of darkness, I saw a pair of piercing green eyes. They glowed with an unsettling luminescence, unlike anything I had encountered before; they seemed to absorb the surrounding light and radiate an almost eerie allure. Fear gripped my chest as I realized we had, perhaps unknowingly, crossed a threshold into something far darker than our innocent game had intended. These eyes weren’t the fiery red of demons from horror stories; instead, they emanated a chilling, otherworldly presence, sending shivers down my spine. Instinctively, I knew we needed to escape the bathroom. 

As I emerged from the suffocating darkness, I reached out and grasped her hand, feeling the cool tile beneath our feet contrasting sharply with the warmth of our intertwined fingers. However, as we rounded the corner, she suddenly paused, her brow furrowing and a look of bewilderment crossing her face.

“Why are we in such a hurry?” she asked, confusion clouding her features. Time seemed to stretch in that moment, my heart hammering in my chest as I hesitated, grappling with what I had just witnessed. “What about the eyes? Did you see them?” I blurted out in desperation.

Her reaction was surprising; she stared at me as though I had lost my grip on reality. “What eyes?” she replied, shaking her head with incredulity. She didn’t see anything amiss; to her, it appeared I was simply anxious. I felt a wave of disorientation wash over me; it was as though I had conjured a hallucination while she remained blissfully ignorant of the truth lurking in the darkness.

After that disconcerting encounter, it felt as if she had vanished from existence altogether. There were no traces of her at school—no fleeting glimpses in the hallway or murmurs of her name. My mind raced with unanswered questions and a growing sense of urgency as I inquired with teachers and classmates, seeking even a hint, a glimmer of recognition. Their responses, however, were the same: blank stares and laughter, dismissive incredulity. “I don’t know who you’re talking about,” they would say, leaving me feeling increasingly isolated and bewildered.

In the following nights, a gnawing sense of unease enveloped me like a heavy cloak. It felt as if reality itself had subtly shifted, leaving me trapped in a world that grew increasingly distorted with each passing day. Small anomalies became my constant companions: the paint on my bedroom walls seemed to shift hues mysteriously, a beloved book would inexplicably vanish from my shelf, or I would catch a fleeting reflection in the mirror that didn’t quite align with my own features. The most jarring experience, though, was the disorientation that came with time; days blended together, feeling strangely out of order, and I would sometimes awaken with the unsettling certainty that years had slipped by while the calendar insistently declared otherwise.

With each new day, an undercurrent of dread coiled tightly around my chest, whispering that something profoundly wrong lay beneath the surface of my life—a sinister reality unraveling around me, and I was the only one aware of this disruption in the fabric of existence.

Weeks later, I received a notification from an unfamiliar user on social media. The name sparked faint recognition, and as we began chatting, a chilling truth emerged. 

She had tricked me. The friend I once knew was not who she seemed; she was a demon. By touching the Ouija board that day, I had unwittingly cursed myself, sealing my fate. She explained that each night, my essence would drift through shifting realities, each one leading me closer to the grotesque realm of hell. 

Overwhelmed by the sheer weight of this revelation, I withdrew from the world. I barricaded myself in my room for a week, emerging only for food or to use the bathroom, too terrified to engage anyone. The faces around me—my family, my friends—seemed like hollow shells, mere puppets created by some malignant force intent on driving me mad. I had not lost my sanity; rather, I had come to accept the crushing reality of my existence. It dawned on me that one day, I would inevitably descend into hell, and there was nothing I could do to avert that terrifying fate.
