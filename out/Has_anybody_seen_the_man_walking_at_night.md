I moved to this town for work, and to get away from larger city life. My last apartment was occupied by a hob goblin of a roommate; a parasite of a human being. Only an hour away, but the calmest i have been in years, plus my coworkers and friends live here. I grew up in a swamp that can be Florida. A town named "Old Town" ran by hicks, white trash, and ghost stories. I became accustomed to strange occurrences. Shriek in the woods, random tree carvings, and murmurs through the night were all abnormally normal. Currently, I am not in a positive state of mind; I have undergone a break up as well as removing a close friend(my roommate) from my life. I assume most of my experiences have been to a poor decisions. I plan to work, from the ground up, in my company. I plan as far to move where they need me available, and their new warehouse will be in Alachua. I'm sidetracked, there is an inconsistency of how often I hear this train whistle through the week. The nights I hear the train, I receive an animal scratching at my front door. All my neighbors have animals, some not using leashes; let their animals roam freely. I have fed a few, especially cats, after my late morning 4am shifts; animals are normal is all i'm saying.

Everything is still etched into my psychi'

A couple of nights ago, 2:45ish, I was walking home after a "break up gym session". The gusty wind had a chill, for it being spring. Appreciating soft music as I walk home, attempting to call a close friend, he had been drinking, and I wanted to be sure he made it home. A shrill wale of a train horn reached through my earbuds. I turn to look where I know the train stays, the tracks are roughly a mile away, yet the sound was clear as day, in a different direction. Aware of my surroundings, the pressure that I wasn't alone fell upon me. I noticed a car passing, blinding me for what I now know was too long; my sight darted towards a figure, wearing a torn purple cloak, a mural of blood concealing the body lurking towards me. I use lurking, only for the fact he, or it, was dragging what might have been its leg, fixated solely on me. Darkness engulfed my vision; even the stars dimmed. the sliding the creature held, didn't increase speed. I turned for one look, to notice an amputee strangling the crutch, that was its leg, severed and managing a plod towards me. Every instance I turned to peak, it was closer, but still not increasing the speed past a hobble. I secured my safety inside. I posted in my bathtub listening to hymns, praying, and shivering with my .45. I'm recollecting my thoughts, in hope someone has had a similar experience. I haven't overheard the train, or haven't been home when it screamed. Am I alone?
