I am on a cruise with my wife up the North American east coast. We’ve been to Yorktown, Boston, and most recently to Charlottetown on Prince Edward Island. Each stop had its own interesting moments. Yorktown and Williamsburg were engaging, though the bookstore in Williamsburg was just one of those Barnes & Noble that doubles as a college store. I was hoping for something more authentic, more historical. Boston was a crowded, noisy mob, but the food was amazing.

I wasn’t expecting much of Charlottetown. I didn’t know anything about Charlottetown. I had no idea that Canada’s founders met there to establish their country. Or that the founders had to sleep on their ship when they showed up for the historic meeting because there were no rooms to rent because the circus was in town. I didn’t know that you could watch sailboats maneuvering together, though for what purpose I don’t know, at the end of Queen Street. And I certainly didn’t expect there to be a little area with Caribbean style canteens selling food nearby.

Painted in bright pinks, greens, and yellows, cordoned off, and set down on the water, the area looks like it should be welcoming you to Jamaica or St. Thomas, rather than Canada. The little incongruity looks out past a dock to the river and dry land hems it in on two sides. On one side, a little walking path runs out to a small pavilion. On the other is a little public seating area where people play music surrounded by restaurants, shops, and an ice cream parlor, all eschewing the bright colors of the little manufactured island. When we left the ship and passed through the seating area, I saw an older couple sitting in the central gazebo, playing “The Midnight Special” to a small crowd of families who were eating ice cream.

As we were lingering, listening to the music, there was a commotion on one of the sail boats coming into the dock. It seemed that someone had been hurt diving near the city. The crowd murmured that he had been swimming a recently discovered shipwreck. Others said that the site was a well-known wreck, mostly in shambles after years of divers picking at it. Others mumbled just to join the noise.

Two paramedics were waiting as the boat pulled in. We saw a young man lying across a bench built into the side of the hull. He writhed in the arms of another young man, their bare chests smeared with blood.

My wife insisted that we leave, and so we walked down to the old cannon battery and then to a point where the boardwalk ends across the street from a playground. We saw a little lighthouse that looked like it was on private property, took pictures, and returned the way we’d come. By the time we reached the space above the brightly colored eateries, the paramedics were long gone. A young woman on the dock was hosing down the boat’s bloody bench. Where the young men had sat was a black nylon drawstring bag that held something several inches long and uneven within. A dark green liquid seeped from the bag as the hose sprayed it down.

I remember wondering if its contents were the diver’s prize that he had paid so dearly for.

We ate lunch at a small Indian “resto,” and wandered for a bit, dipping into bookstores that were much more to my liking than the one in Williamsburg, and visiting the kitschy shops dedicated to Anne of Green Gables. When we were getting close to my “safe return time,” which was an hour and a half before the cruise required guests to return to the ship, we retraced our steps back to the little public area by the dock.

When we got there no one was playing in the gazebo, but a young woman was standing by the walking path playing a guitar. I can’t remember what the song was. I can only remember that it was familiar, and I felt the whole time as if I were on the cusp of naming it.

I walked closer to her, perhaps to hear the song better, perhaps because I found the young woman attractive, or perhaps because she was just in our path. Whatever my reasons, I was close enough to see the face of a man as he walked up to her and started to dance to her music. He looked surprised. I thought he was probably in his sixties, or maybe early seventies. There were two clear age-spots on his left cheek and temple, and his fingers were knobby. He wore a loose-fitting polo shirt, equally roomy khaki shorts with a belt, and Velcro-strap sandals. He had a long, lean, gray-bearded face that stretched even longer with a look of amazement.

His dancing was, at first, minimalistic. I thought the surprised look on his face was a put-on. I guessed he was trying to make the musician or someone else laugh. But the look of confusion grew into concern as his subtle gyrations turned into a hopping, flailing expression of dynamic exaltation. Still, I thought the look on his face was meant to amuse someone. I had seen entertainers make similar faces, feigning surprise or confusion for comedic effect as they marveled at their own performance.

It was when he dropped suddenly to his knees, his eyes blazing with pain, that I changed my mind about his intentions. This was not a joke, I thought as his bones cracked against the pavement. I heard people gasp. I might have gasped. I think that many of us who had been watching him thought that something in his performance had just gone terribly wrong. But then he stood, his knees scraped and blood starting to well, and he began to dance again. Then, after a disorienting moment, he jumped up and went down onto his knees again, slamming them into the concrete. Tears ran from his eyes and down his lined cheeks into his thick gray beard. Four times he jumped up and slammed himself back down, until the crack of bone was so loud that it snapped people’s heads around toward him.

Someone screamed.

I looked at the young woman and couldn’t imagine why she was continuing to play as the man battered himself against the stones. Tears rolled down her face as she looked past me out toward the boats. I followed her gaze and saw something sitting on the edge of the hull precariously against the silver rail above the nylon bag that now lay flat on the bench. It was maybe only a foot tall, and about the same width at the bottom, though it narrowed quickly to one side and then stretched out again at the top, forming an undulating and uneven “C” shape of dark greens and browns. It might have been wood or plastic, but my impression was of age-green metal. The top of the figure was much narrower than the bottom, extending from the upright section as a slim rod or pipe that appeared to be gold. It ran narrowly for a few inches and then flared out, like the end of a long trumpet. The overall impression was of some reclining figure holding a horn to its lips, though its details were obscured by muck, vegetation, and tarnish.

I saw the object for only a handful of seconds before my wife screamed.

I turned, suddenly certain that I would see her moving in front of the guitarist. Instead, the man who had battered himself was now bowed with his hands on the ground bashing his head onto the concrete. His mouth was open, as if he were screaming, but he was silent except for the *crack, crack, crack* of his skull against the path.

But the man’s convulsions were not what my wife was screaming about. She wasn’t looking at him. She was looking at me. Or, rather, she was trying to look at me. She flicked her eyes back and forth from me to something past me in the dock. I thought she was trying to tell me to look, but when I felt my foot tap the ground and rise again on its own, I realized that I was moving in a slow, subtle rhythm in front of the girl with the guitar. I looked down to see my feet shuffle forward and then back, as my hands moved slowly up and then down, left and then right. I looked at my wife and wondered why she wouldn’t come to me, to put her arms around me, to stop me from hurling myself to the ground. But she didn’t, even as my steps became more frantic and exaggerated. She just stood and watched with an expression of horror that I don’t think I’ll ever forget.

I believe that expression would likely have been one of the last things I ever saw, because a moment later I leapt up and tucked my legs under me, dropping to the ground on my knees. The pain was immense, and my fear was overwhelming. I stood and leapt into the air once more, certain that my legs must break under the impact. But, instead, the pavement only cut into my skin and sent shockwaves up my thighs.

I did not rise a third time. The young woman had stopped playing. A moment later, my wife was beside me, hugging me. The man who had been battering himself lay still on the ground, and the musician collapsed and began to sob. I felt only the thrumming of adrenaline and the burning in my knees.

The crowd swelled, people called emergency services, and onlookers wore expressions of troubled disbelief. As we waited for paramedics to arrive, I looked over at the boat and saw that the figure was gone. Perhaps a strong wave had knocked it into the water, or perhaps someone took it. I don’t know.

No one came to interview us, no one caused a ruckus afterward. I understand why. All that happened was that one man had convulsions and was alive when paramedics took him away. I merely fell on my knees, for which I received ice packs and bandages when I refused transport to a hospital. I can’t even find a social media post about the event. It took about two minutes, and during that time everyone affected, except me and the old man, just looked at things. I doubt it will be more than an anecdote for most people, something they saw on an idle weekday afternoon.

All of this happened yesterday. I’m writing this from my cabin on the ship as we turn around and return south. I don’t think I’ll be going up on deck much for the rest of the trip. I didn’t break anything, but bruises and scrapes are rampant around my knees.

But my injuries aren’t keeping me here, in this room. I’m not going up because of my memory of the faces around me as the music played. Faces I only glanced while the dance took me over. Faces that all looked out to the water, out to where the boat was, to where the figure perched.

They all wore the same look. They were eager.

Those faces trouble me as much as my experience of dancing, especially because I recognized one of them. I’ve seen him on the cruise. He’s a middle-aged guy, balding, soft around the middle, glasses. He walks with his head down, looking at his feet as he goes. But during the dance, he looked out at the water with the same expression as the crowd. When it was all over, I watched him wander off toward the ship, eyes on his feet.

I saw him again last night when my wife and I took a slow walk around the deck, testing my mobility after the day’s events. The sun was setting over Prince Edward Island, and the ocean to the east was already dark. I saw him leaning against a railing, his arms crossed over the top rail. His features were dark, and I only glimpsed them when a door opened and flashed a light over him.

The man was looking out across the dark water with an eager look in his eyes. And when I looked at my wife, I saw her eyes turn toward the sea, her lips parted in anticipation, wearing the same look as the man. They both looked expectantly out at the dark waters. In their eyes I could see that they were both waiting – waiting to take their turn.
