A sound. A movement in your un-vision. Your broken consciousness is an ocean under a thunderstorm. As you fade in, the camera of your mind’s eye focuses on crisp white paint, and the sound of a buzzing fly. It had followed you into your unmaking, and your awareness of it simply revealed itself to have been there from the start. You blink the built up dust from your eyes.

*How did I get in this room?*

The question flows through your mind like blood pumping through a vein. You feel it. Physically. Synapses firing. More mechanical than psychological. You bring your hands to your face and find that they are crusted over with blood. A nausea pulsates from within your skull and worms its way into your neck.  What is that taste on your tongue? Why does it taste familiar? Again the thoughts pass through you as physical objects. Threatening to burst your temples and smear themselves across the walls.

You stand. Slowly. And observe your surroundings.

Scarlet. The walls are smothered in gore. A kind of sculpture before you. It is human, almost. Was human. A skull atop a spinal column, twisted vertebrae. Bent oroborus-like. Tailbone fed into jaw bone. Entrails fed through the cervical curvature and into the Atlas C7 disk. Threadlike. You are reminded of your mother’s sewing machine. You are reminded of its needle prick sting in your forefinger. The way the thread slowly oozed out of the wound with the pus and the blood.

The sculpture speaks.

*“LIFEFORM DETECTED. SUBMIT QUERY.”*

The voice is buried in mind-fog.

The question leaves your lips.

“How did I get in this room?”

The sculpture answers.

*“SUBJECT CONFIRMED TO HAVE TRANSGRESSED THE DEMIURGE MATRIX. LOCKDOWN OF DIVINE SPARK RESULTED IN TRANSFERENCE TO THE NU-SPHERE. TEETH UPON TEETH UPON TEETH AWAIT YOU BEYOND THE THRESHOLD. DIAGNOSIS: MIND PALACE BESIEGED BY THE SKINLESS CHRIST. RECOMMENDATION: REINFORCE PROTECTIVE SIGILS AND AWAIT ASSISTANCE.”*

“Ken? What happened to Ken?”

*“DEVOURED BY TEETH UNCOUNTABLE. HER SCREAMS ARE MOCKED.”*

\[REATTEMPTING CONNECTION\]

\[CONNECTION ESTABLISHED\]

The blade dances across your chest. The sigil is not complex. Basic emergency sigil-craft. Hot flashes and stars flood forth as you peel back the skin. The trauma-form manifests. You slap your flesh against the window, blood slick, the sigil clings like a command strip. Beyond the cheap float-glass, there are stars. Beyond the stars, there is a deep, hateful laughter. There’s that buzzing again. You swat at the fly absentmindedly.

You recognize your surroundings after a time. Your old college dorm room. Bare brick walls, a slap of cheap white paint. Dull gray carpeting that crunches underfoot. There is no furniture. No faded posters clinging to the wall with scotch tape. No unwashed dishes or dirty clothes strewn about haphazardly. No smell of cheap marijuana smoke.

There is the bedroom, a barren, 12 by 19 foot expanse that is cornered by the bathroom. There is the door leading outside, locked up tightly, crisis sigils carved into its wood. There is The Sculpture, sitting in the center of the room, and there is you. Blood soaked flannel jacket, hands trembling, a feeling in your skull like a gunshot. The nausea returns and you place your hands on your knees. Again, you turn to the sculpture.

“Fucking head is killing me.”

*“ANALYZING. DIAGNOSING. THE CRACKS IN YOUR MIND BLEED WITH HOLY RADIATION. THEN UNTO THE ETERNAL LIGHT THEY TURNED, ON WHICH IT IS NOT CREDIBLE COULD BE, BY ANY CREATURE BENT AN EYE SO CLEAR. HOLY, HOLY, HOLY BE THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY. WITHIN YOU LIES AN INFINITUM THAT CANNOT BE.”*

“Wait. It worked? Why is it in *my* head? I thought Lee was the only one who could even-”

“ANALYZING. SUBJECT: LEE BENNET. STATUS: DEVOURED BY TEETH UNCOUNTABLE. HIS AGONY TRANSCENDS THOUGHT.”

“Ah.” Your eyes rest on the carpet. Right hand clenching your pocket knife to near breaking. “Did anyone actually, uh, make it out?”

*“ANALYZING. SUBJECT: SOPHIA HERNANDEZ. STATUS: DEVOURED BY TEETH UNCOUNTABLE. WITH ANGUISHED SCREAMS, SHE BETRAYS YOU.”*

*“ANALYZING. SUBJECT: WEI ZHANG. STATUS: DECEASED VIA SELF INFLICTED BULLET WOUND UPON HER IDENTITY BEING EXPOSED TO THE POWERS OF HEAVEN.”*

*“ANALYZING. SUBJECT: FLYNN TOMAS. STATUS: UNKNOWN.”*

“Flynn? Oh god, how di-”

A knock on the door.

You turn. Slowly.

A movement in the shadows beneath the door. Thin slivers of darkness that bend and twist and cut through the room from the undergap. A sound like trumpets, like weeping and hate and a shape emerges. Small. Snakelike. The crisis-sigil on the window rots and the smell of it burns in your nostrils. Within your head, white hot flame licks the underside of your skull.

*“WARNING. HOLY NIGHTMARE DETECTED.”*

The tongue from beyond the door has you before you can process it. You feel it around your ankle. Around your chest. You feel it around your throat and you feel it tightening with a strength that overpowers you completely. A cruel flash of pain and your femur is snapped. Rug burn on your arms and legs as you are dragged. The pressure on your chest is total. Complete. Something behind the eyes spits and laughs. The pressure spreads up your throat. Over your face.

For a moment you cannot see.

For a moment there is pale light and flame.

A sensation of twisting. Of pressure and the splitting of flesh.

There is something moving inside your soul.

And then it is over. In one hand, a crimson splattered pocket knife. In the other, the still wriggling tongue. Still, something is wrong. Surroundings flat and smothered in technicolor. Depth perception defies you. Slowly, you reach your hand to your face and find that half your vision is missing. A trail of gore streaming down your right cheek. You try to stand and find you cannot. There is no pain. Not yet. Adrenaline foam coats your veins. And the breath in your chest slows. And the beat in your chest calms.

“Shit.”

You glance around. The Sculpture had been knocked over in the fight. Static hiss from its mouth.

And then a voice.

*“J…ss… ames?....James can you hear me?”*

You recognize the voice immediately.

“Flynn?” And the fire returns to your skull.

“Never thought I’d be so happy to hear your voice.”

*“James, what happened? What happened when you got inside? I remember, like a song. And a flash of light. The rest of the team is dark.”*

“The rest of the team is gone. Dead, or worse.”

*“Fuck.”*

“I got it, Flynn. I’ve got it right now. Inside me.”

*“You got it? You? How the fuck did that happen?”*

“No clue.”

*“Okay, look. Where are you?”*

“In my own head, apparently. Consciousness lockdown. Imago Dei completely fucked me. It was… It was so much more than I thought it would be.”

*“It was the face of God James. The literal, actual, face of God. What did you expect?”*

“I expected anything else.”

*“Okay so, you got past the face and into the head and you grabbed everything you could get your hands on. Then what?”*

“That’s the blank space. Wasn’t good, I know that.”

*“Alright well, give me a few hours and I’ll come get you. Do. Not. Move. Not until I get there. Understand?”*

“No.”

*“No?”*

“They’re out there Flynn. Outside the room. My head. Whatever. They got past my protective sigils and I only barely managed to fight them off.”

*“Oh. Oh shit.”*

"Yea.”

*“You realize, there’s nothing we can do for you right? You have a piece of God in your head. Stolen from the bowels of heaven. Their own fucking home. They will never stop.”*

“Yea.”

*“I’m sorry.”*

“Me too.”

*“You said they got in already?”*

“Yea. Broke my leg and took my eye.”

*“Your eye?”*

“Yes my eye.”

*“The one… in your head. Where you are currently holding a stolen piece of God.”*

“Shit.”

And then you feel it. Hiding behind the fading adrenaline rush and the slowly creeping pain.

*"Well, that's it then.”*

“Looks like it.”

*“I… I need to go, James. If they've already planted something inside your head, that means they’re listening.”*

“Yea. Good luck Flynn.”

And the line goes dead.

And the shape inside you moves.
