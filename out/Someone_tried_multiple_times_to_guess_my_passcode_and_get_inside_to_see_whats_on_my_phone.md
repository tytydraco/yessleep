This happened in mid 2022, I can’t really remember.

My phone got water damaged and the LCD screen suddenly started acting strange and the colors completely went off and the screen went black. I knew the screen was on because there was still some light emitting from it but other than that, it was like a complete black hole.

I’m still a student so I didn’t have a job or money to afford to get it repaired. So I asked my mom if she could help me.

She didn’t like the idea as I broke another phone last year and she was tired of my bullshit. So she straight up said get a job and fix it yourself. 

But the screen didn’t have any cracks or scratches on it, almost like the screen went black without any reason. So I had an idea.

I thought maybe if I convince the dealers that I got the phone from that the screen went blank without any reason, they’d exchange it for a new one ‘cause of the warranty.

There aren’t many apple stores in my region and most people rely on third party repair shops to get their phones fixed.

But these repair shops have a bad reputation of accessing customers’ phone data by plugging them with data cables and selling the data they gather for profit, or to hold peoples’ dignity and self respect for ransom.

But I took the risk anyway since I didn’t have anything to hide in my phone.

I called the shop and explained the story exactly as I planned, but immediately they just knew something was off and didn’t buy it, they wanted to physically check the phone for an inspection before coming to any conclusion.

So I went there and handed the phone over to them, and the next day, they said that after they’ve checked, they spotted small droplets of water inside the iPhone circuit and that they’ve officially concluded that it’s water damaged by me and they have nothing to do with it.

I tried convincing them again and again but it was no use, and told me it would cost a 105$ for a screen replacement.

I didn’t have that kind of money so I asked them to lower the price down a bit and they agreed on 82.

It was still a significant amount to me but since they refused to lower the price further, I told them to just keep hold of the phone until I save up some bucks and they agreed.

And now this is where things get a bit unexplainable.

Months passed by and I get a call from the shop saying the screen was “restored” all of a sudden.

I was like WTF!? HOW!? I was so happy and excited over the news but at the same time, was completely at a loss as to how is that even possible.

I told them I’ll swing by the shop in the evening and sure enough, the screen was working fine and the colors were back! I was visibly smiling at the scene!

But when I tried to type in the passcode, it was locked, not just for 2-3 minutes, but for an ENTIRE HOUR.

I told them about the passcode lock and they said they know nothing about and just shrugged it off and went to answer their other customers who were there.

And then I realized what they might’ve tried to do over the past months while my phone was there.

1 hour means there were about 10 failed attempts, and God knows how much they attempts they’ve tried.

There are stories of unlucky people who’ve gotten their explicit images and videos leaked by these third party repair shop companies and taking no responsibility for their malicious intents and completely ruining their customers’ self image.

I waited in the shop until the locked time expired and checked if anything’s changed or missing. Luckily, everything was A okay.

I feared they might’ve guessed the combination now that they’ve seen me put in the code by the CCTV so I changed my passcode since.

Just goes to show how just 6 digits can protect someone’s whole self image.

But the screen suddenly turning back to normal is still a mystery…
