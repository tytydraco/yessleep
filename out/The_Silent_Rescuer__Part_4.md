Greetings, darlings.

I am back, as I promised. In here, [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helena_The_Doll_Clown/comments/1hih5qu/the_silent_rescuer_part_3/)

Yes, this post is about the same night again (It was a very long one.). I did not feel ready to go out. Was I afraid of the world outside? I was. But it was not just fear, it was like it had something pretty toxic, irritating. Not extremely irritating, but like intoxicating or irritating at the same time, as a whole, so to say. In this house, those things are present, but somewhat less. 

Helena received a DM from Ruxandra on her laptop and called me to show it to me. It was a tombstone in a cemetery from Edinburgh, it was beautifully sculpted, a bit covered in moss, to the right of the image it was a tree. The top of tombstone was like the top of a gothic arch. In the center is a medallion, a portrait of a girl sculpted in the stone. Underneath, it was my name, my birth date and the date of my disappearance as the date of death. A deep sadness took over me, as I saw the image. A feeling of unreal and detachment took over me, like the person that I used to be was buried there and it was like I was an imposter because I held on to the identity of the mortal girl I used to be and whose tombstone I saw now… 

”Your parents made this in your memory, when they returned to Scotland. Your father wanted to stay over in Romania after his mission ended, to keep looking for you. Your nanny lied pretty well that she was attacked, hit in the head and saw nobody. The police decided she was innocent. Your parents left the country, eventually, probably heartbroken, considering you dead. They build this for you. Eventually, they had another child, a boy named Brian. He died ten years ago, it is not clear if they are descendents of his.” 

I looked in her eyes, then cuddled in her arms. After a while, as I came out of the embrace, she showed me more pictures of the tombstone, with some people dressed in Victorian attire, with sunglasses and dark makeup, both males and females. ”It seems your grave is pretty well known, although not everybody knows your whole story. Even Goths like the place and come there, for photoshoots, some even for picnics.” I looked a bit abashed at this. ”Yes,” continued Helena, ”there are some people called Goths who have their own dark music and are attracted to spooky things. Odette, whom you met already, has been one of them since she was a teen. She introduced me to the whole Goth subculture and music. They seem to like Vampires a lot.”. She played a bit with the curls on my temple and smiled. I managed to give a faint smile, as she returned to finish the chores.

After finishing, Helena turned to me: ”How are you feeling? Do you feel like coming out?” I mumbled: ”I do not know…” ”Are you afraid that much? I feel you being fearful.” ”I am afraid, but not just that… Is this, how to say, something that makes me feel bad, this sort of humming of things, of the outside world, like being sunken in it… Not a sound, but a bit like a sound. It makes me feel both revulsed and nervous. In here I feel it  as well, but less than outside.” ”Did you feel it before our reunion?” ”I did, it made all the bad things worse.” Back in the day, before I was put to sleep, did you feel it?” ”I do not know… Maybe a bit, but not nearly as strong as now.”

Helena thought about it, then answered: ”I think I know what it is. I call it *the Buzz*. We live in a world surrounded by electrical things, they emit vibrations. Electricity and radio existed back then, but it was much weaker than today. Now we have the Internet that means a lot of information transmitted through a technology called Wifi that is basically, waves, similar to radio waves, but much stronger. This makes the Buzz even stronger. It uses infra vibrations, lower frequency vibrations that allow us to feel things from the spirit world more than it would otherwise be felt. Dark spirits can get more powerful around us through this.

Everybody is affected by it. You know why you feel better here? Because I have no Wifi on, I disabled it on the router. I connect my laptop using wires and I use only an old school mobile phone, with no internet connection. ”

This did not sound good at all. I said: ”I feel like staying inside even more now.” ”Well, I do not know how we can handle this. I need to go out of the house from time to time. What shall it be, would you come with me, or stay in the house, alone?” Something in my mind reminded me of the *Rescuer* and I could not escape the thought of being alone, that he may come when I am alone. Shall I tell Helena about what happened? I have not told her or anyone of my meeting with the Rescuer or anything that happened that night. I gave a sigh and sat on a chair. Shall I tell Helena? She is powerful and knowledgeable, she could know what was that.

So I decided to speak up, looking at the window: ”Do you know why I was so bad when I reached your home?” She came next to me and sat down. I continued: ”Perhaps you thought it was just the result of years living as a doll. In a way, that is true, but it was not just that. I think I could have continued to live like that at least for a while, if something did not happen\*..\*.” Helena whispered gently: ”Do you want to tell me?” I kept looking at the window and I went on: ”I was the favorite doll of a beautiful little girl called Anais. She reminded me of me, before I was taken and turned. At first, when I was brought in as a gift to Anais by her mother, it felt like a good family. And, perhaps, it really was. I was no longer an exhibit in a museum, I was in a real family, even if it was all so bitter. At least the bittersweet, not just bitter.

The parents considered me valuable in a material sense, especially the father, and they warned Anais not to damage me, or handle me too much. But she cared about me, she tried to take me with her in her bed. I often felt the need to bite her, but I always managed to stop. I drank only the blood of her father. I cared for her, I wanted to talk to her, but I did not dare. She would have freaked out, probably. I even thought of turning her into a Vampire. I may have succeeded, because she was small. Perhaps I should have opened up to her and told her I was alive, that may have avoided all, at least one day before. One day, no earlier…

I felt something was wrong, and it got worse as time passed. The parents acted weird and felt weird even when they did not act weird. Days passed and I got to sleep harder and harder, my energy getting drained, as something was coming. Anais seemed to feel it as well, becoming avoidant of her parents. Even the grandparents, when they came to visit, felt weird. If I only acted earlier…” I laid my head in my hands, covering my eyes. Helena came and gently surrounded me with her arms. I continued sobbing, although it felt really bad and I wished I was able to cry.

I told her what happened that night, what you shared with you on the first post. I trembled as I re-lived it all and, when I finally reached the point of getting down from the tree, I broke out in tears. Helena took me in her arms and held my head on her chest, caressing me. It felt better after a few minutes, when I was able to continue the story of what happened that evening, until I reached her house. Helena held me in her arms for a long time, until I was able to take my head from her chest and look her in the eyes, still in tears. Then I saw that, silently, she wept too…

”The Lord heard you. You were unable to call for Him, you did not dare to believe in Him and call Him. So terrible was it all you felt! But, somehow, you managed to call Him, He heard you and saved you. He loves you, as He loved me. He suffered alongside me, as He suffered alongside you. When we make one step towards Him, He makes a thousand towards us. I see it as obvious after what you told me.” An immense sweetness and light were in Helena's eyes.

My heart was torn in two now. I felt this incredible calling, but a part of me was not ready to accept it. Yet, because I had felt the calling, I decided to speak up.

”I remember what you told me back then that Humans are food, that it is natural not to feel anything for them. Indeed, it felt natural to prey on them, at least on some. Now, you tell me the opposite, that we need not to prey on them.” ”Yes, because they have worth as people, as persons. You told me you used to have a puppy, back in Scotland, right?” ”I did.” ”Now, you enjoyed eating cooked meat as a child, right?” ”I did.” ”How would you have felt then, after eating a delicious meat dish, if you found out you ate your puppy?” ”I think I would feel just horrible and grieved immensely…” ”You would have bound with that being, from soul to soul. A gorgeous tasty meal would not have been worth the trauma, wouldn't it?” I looked into her eyes. She continued:

”Now imagine that after that meal you found that you have not eaten your puppy, your puppy being alive and well, but that ate some other child”s puppy, a child you didn't know in person, but of whom you knew they shared a similar bond with their puppy. How would that have felt?” ”I think I would be glad that was not my puppy, I would have felt a bit sad for that child, perhaps.” ”Now, imagine that you found out that first, after one meal, you found out you ate your puppy, then after another meal, you found out that you were that child”s puppy.” I thought about it for a bit. ”I would have been really bad, it would remind me of my own pain.” 

”What would have been hurt more, if you found out you ate your puppy, your own loss or the suffering and death experienced by the puppy?” Now that really got me thinking. I mumbled: ”I think of my own loss but…” ”If you saw your puppy being tormented and slaughtered, how would you have felt?” ”I think it would have been horrible…” ”How would your puppy have felt during all this?.” ”Bad, really bad…” ”And that would have meant that *you* would have felt really bad, right?” ”I guess…”

”I think you remember how it was when you were taken and turned,” (at this point, she whispered really gently, like being handling something really delicate very carefully, in order not to break it), ”how terrible it was of you… Think that, after all that, somehow, you would have become Human again in a moment after the transformation ended, without experiencing anything as a Vampire, and you saw what happened to you happening to somebody else…” I stood silent. ”You know, when I was commanded to drink your blood then, a part of me screamed and just wanted to jump into a chasm, as I remembered my own transformation, as a child…” I looked at the ground and let her continue:

”I know how it is when you hunt, all the feeling, all the taste of it, the delight of tormenting the victim, while taking their life force by torment or through their blood. It feels not just quenching our thirst, but it feels fulfilling, it feels natural to us, it feels *right* for us. But how does it feel for the Human?” ”It is our nature, this is what we do…” ”It is. Yet, the suffering and death of the Human does not matter?” ”It does matter to some of them, I think”. ”Of whom?” ”Of those who are innocent or of those we care for.” ”That is a start. Now, how do we determine who deserves to live and who does not?” ”I do not know… If we know that they are innocent, we avoid them, if we do not know, we feed on them. This is how I always thought...”

”And what if the person you feed upon, without knowing, is someone who does wonderful things, like helping the poor, or a single parent who struggles? Or perhaps that is a bad person, a really bad person, but who still keeps something good in their soul and, if they remain alive, they shall change and become a wonderful person? Things like that happen.”

”And why should we care?” ”Well, from a moral standpoint, we should care. But ok, perhaps you do care morally but, beyond this,  you achieve a state when you care because you like it, because you enjoy it, because it warms your heart. Not just being loved gives this sweetness, but also loving somebody else, perhaps even more. And a bit of love is even when you do not love or care for a particular person, but you choose not to harm that person, even if your moral conscience does not compel you to do it or does it too faint.”

I became silent. Helena stood silent as well for a bit and then said gently: ”Perhaps you are not compelled to change, to repent, perhaps it does not make sense to you. But I can tell it is wonderful to do it. ” I managed to look into her eyes and I felt a great peace and sweetness in there. My heart was torn in two. Helena whispered one more thing: ”And, in a way, it makes sense to be consistent from one side to the other. If you are gentle with some and predator with others, you are not consistent with yourself.” That made sense and it was pretty on point.

Then another thought arose in me and said it at once: ”What about Anais? Why was she taken? Was she guilty of anything? If God is all-loving, as you say, why did this happen to Anais? Why did it all happen to me, why I was turned, why I had to exist like an object from decades, paralysed and in misery? Why were you turned and got your Human life taken away from you?” Helena closed her eyes and answered: ”God allows many things for reasons He knows. They are never without a purpose. Look at me. If I have not been turned, I may have never come to know Him as I do now. Without me being turned, my Elven friends would not have had the chance to know what they are, there may not be any Elf out there to know that they are Elves, Artanis would not be alive today, Ruxandra would still do that awful work in the mainstream media and who knows what else? *No hell is too great, if it becomes the cause for a heaven greater than it.*

(She went silent for a bit, then continued.) God is The Source of all that is good, He Is absolute in goodness and the reason of goodness. If we consider Him bad or consider something to be bad that is good for Him, we are the ones who are wrong, nor Him, no way around this. We cannot be right and Him to be wrong.”

I looked her in the eyes, I confronted all that peace, light and love and said: ”I remember the fear in Anais”s eyes, moments before they grabbed her. I remember her terror as those arms took her and that thing was taking her, like a giant, hungry, insatiable mouth, as her conscience drifted away. And now look me in the eyes and tell me it was all worth it for some greater good!” Helena suffered now, I could tell, her soul covered in deep bitterness. She looked me in the eyes and stood silent. I left the chair and went into a corner. Helena stood up slowly and prepared dinner, as expected.

The evening was pretty silent, without any arguing. She did the massage she did before, to make sure my body recovers. She was still affectionate towards me, as before. In the end, she took me in her arms, as we fell asleep in her coffin and I felt her love. I let myself drift into bitterness and had weird, twisted dreams. In the last one, it was like I was in 1930ies, when I was with the other Dolls, into that life sized doll house from the fair of Obor, where we were the decor and us were set up in an early XIXth century setup, in lace, velvet and sparkled with musk perfume, people coming to feel creeped out by us, as we rarely moved, only a twitch, just enough to startle them out, but not to sure we were alive.

I woke up close to sunset, before Helena. As I opened my eyes, I could see sunlight through the curtains and felt the weakness of daylight I knew too well. Helena was still asleep and I managed to get up without waking her up. I went towards the window, as I felt like testing if I could resist the sunlight. I went really close to the curtains, but did not pull them. I focused on the bits of light coming through the fiber of the curtain cloth. I thought of Anais, what happened to her, if she is still alive or if, if she was still alive, if it were better for her to have died, as the very thought of being immersed in that hellish light made me shiver.

As I thought of those, somebody seemed to come near the house and sit against the fence. First, I was worried but, as minutes passed by, the person, who did not seem to be anything that a normal, simple Human, seemed not to move, I continued drifting into my thoughts, still keeping an eye on the person outside.

No, I could not live with the thought of God allowing things like Anais going through all that and all that evil upon the innocent from the whole world, since the world existed. No, it was not worth it. Was I wrong, if it was not possible for God to be wrong, like Helena said? I did not care. It mattered what felt right *for me*. And, basically, how *I felt* in general. I did not care if I was wrong. So be it! How can God be all-loving of everyone of us, even of the most evil creature, as Helena said, if He can make things so that no innocent shall suffer, if He Is Almighty and able to do all that and still *not* do it? 

Freedom, said Helena, without freedom, there is no authenticity, therefore no true life, no soul. Ok, it makes sense, but only somewhat, why The Almighty did not make it, somehow, to be both authenticity and no suffering of the innocent? Then the thought that the Rescuer *may be* right in his endeavor. Perhaps not right, but acceptable and desirable, if the right way means suffering and injustice to the innocent. Perhaps God loves me and the Rescuer hates me. I did not care, why shall I not accept the Rescuer and other forces like him anyway due to this and go against God, against all His goodness, wisdom and love that causes or at least accepts all that harm? 

As I thought of all those, an emptiness took over my soul, like a sharp chasm that grew deeper and I could not stop it. Even more, I encouraged it and forced myself to like it. Yes, I wanted the Rescuer to come for me and take me, to rescue me from God who does not want to be right what I wanted to be right. Yes, I agreed with Helena in what she told me, but I hated this more and more, and I began to love to hate it, as my heart trembled more and more due to it.

I stared blankly into faint sunlight fading away, like hoping to harm me. I opened my arms wide, like an invite for something.

My soul sobbed, but I could not stop now. An *un-love* started to engulf me and feel colder and colder, as the seconds passed, an un-love that rejected love, that could not receive love, an un-love that was deep hatred, but more than hatred, and I wanted to surrender to it. Despair grew in my soul, as something drifted away and away. I focused on the faint sunlight through the curtains so much that it started to see it having a different color, more whitish, a bit blueish. I noticed it with a part of my mind, and another did not. I was deep enough by now into the un-love, that I felt the need to contemplate the love it is opposed to, personified in Helena, who was peacefully asleep in her coffin.

I went to her, as I trembled and I did not know why, as I was not ready to admit that I suspected a certain something being at work. As I was close to the coffin, I looked back at the window. There was still light through the curtains, although the sun was supposed to have set by now. I clenched my fists, as a sign of accepting the un-love and closed my eyes. Then, in my eyes something remained. Have you ever stared into a light bulb for some time then, after closing your eyes or just by moving away from the light source,  so that you could see in front of your eyes the contour of the bulb or of the filament, like a burn? It was like that, but it was the shape of a man, standing. *The Rescuer* was *here*, in the house. I fell towards the coffin.

I loved the un-love that united me and the Rescuer, as I have embraced it, although not with all my heart, even if my soul shook uncontrollably, as I knew I shall be taken to Hell or something like that. I felt, somewhat, *natural*, as I was incapable of accepting God and what He offered to me but, on other hand, I was terrified beyond any means of expression, something that grew so much that would soon reach an unbearable point for my soul.

Helena twitched, as she woke up. It is a very bad idea, for most people, to suddenly wake up Helena from her slumber, her reaction may be fatal to you, even merely contemplating her in that state may cause a heart attack for those faint at heart. But be sure that, if such a person would be there, this wrath of Helena would have been nothing more than a small ich, compared to the presence that came for me.

Helena gave a scream that could make a fierce Werewolf whimper like a puppy. She grabbed me fiercely at her chest, covered my eyes with her hands and shouted: ”Do not look at him, pray! Pray with me!” She started to pray continuously, over and over: ”Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner!”

I could not receive the prayer for me, not because I was a Vampire or a creature of the night, but because of what I have chosen. Already that being had rights over me, to take me, as I gave it to him and still left him to have them. My fate was almost sealed. Helena held me in her arms with an immense straight, I could feel a giant love for me coming from Helena now, a love that would make her give herself to be taken as the price for my redemption, a giant love and a giant sweetness that came alongside it. I did not want this or it felt like I was no longer capable of accepting it, and something from me called the Rescuer to finish the job faster.

Something started to engulf me from my feet, going from there to the pelvis and upper. My horror of it all could only make the process stronger and faster, like the spiral downwards getting narrower fast.I could feel a terrible sadness that filled Helena with a despair I could not comprehend, a manifestation of the same love I felt earlier, as she realized it was all almost in vain. She prayed now: ”Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us, the sinners!” almost not being able to breathe, but she held on with the last pieces of strength, being ready to die, but not to let go. I looked in her love and I realized: *I could not let such great love for me turn to misery*, I could let myself go, but I could not let Helena bear the fact that I shall be taken. No, no way!

I clinged myself on Helena, although the chance of reversing the process was slim. Helena on her own was surely unable to stop me from being taken and, besides, the part of me that stood up against God was against Him still, but not against Helena. Yet, He was the only hope of stopping it all and preventing Helena”s heart from being broken. The best I could do, in this situation, was to allow a part of my heart to look up, towards Him, expecting something to come.

I looked with my heart at her love and its unbelievable struggle and I realized then the love of Helena was not alone, it was supported and in communion with a much, much greater love from beyond her, a Greater Love who called up for her when the moment came, and she accepted, as she told me in detail already. And, if I could not allow myself to hurt the love of Helena, I could not allow to hurt the much greater love of God for neither. My choice was done. I started praying with Helena: ”Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us, the sinners!”

Things were turned around in an instant, a wonderful power came through Helena into me, almost overwhelming, as I knew now I belonged there, not on the other side. We both cried of happiness, as the power, in a matter of seconds, send the Rescuer away of me and pushed him, with a bang, like a bullet from a gun, into a distance beyond comprehension, like in a horizontal tunnel that closed with a bang and hellish presence was no more.

I sobbed, as we were both crying. ”I am so sorry…” I said. ”I shall not call him again… Forgive me…” She looked a little abashed at me, as she caressed my head. ”Now I know that you love me… Now I know God loves me… I can not break your heart and let myself go, and I can not hurt Him either…”

”You see,” she replied, as we kept on crying, ”He asks us to trust Him that He knows best, that He knows why, because He Is Almighty and All Knowing, but He does not force us… Yet, our heart can be deeply hurt, so deep that it may appear that it shall never heal, so we can end up giving up. But we must never give up, and not just in trusting Him, but also in fighting His fight, to love, heal and make it right, as best as we can, because He likes to work through us, to be not His mere tools, but His living icons, that in our free will His good work   be united with our good work that comes from our own freedom. And now, honestly, it feels for me that, for a heart that is hurt, this fight can, at least, relieve the pain of that heart or, even more, heal it, perhaps not at once, but with perseverance, in time.”

Her corpse eyes, her monster eyes had something in them that called me, I could not understand what to, as of yet, but it was strong, yet not forcing me at all, like the hellish force did, but it was open, like a huge openness.

”You know,” she continued, ”we can try to figure out what happened with Anais. We may be able to help her or, at least, prevent this from happening to others. Ruxandra told me earlier that there are reports of those days of several families disappearing without a trace. It makes me think that that was not just an isolated case. I think it would be a good idea to call Ruxandra and tell her all you told me about Anais and her family. She will investigate, it is her profession, she could publish online about this as well.” I nodded my head, Helena gently placed on my feet, as she stood up.

Joy and peace was in my heart now, as my soul became calmer in the early night. Helena called Ruxandra and told her there is something we all need to talk about, probably tonight. Yeet I still felt a shadow lingering, like something watching. I came towards the window and I realized the person from early on just now left. A faint whisper in my thoughts told me the Rescuer shall be back. A cold chill was on my spine, remembering what had just happened and I knew that, on my own, I had no chance in defeating that terrible and ruthless foe. Helena ended up the call and said:

”Ruxandra is on her way in. Indeed, she kept thinking about those disappearances. Last winter, there were people disappearing, we did not know why at first but, in the end, we discovered that the true reason behind it was more sinister than any of us suspected. This time it does not look the same, but it is similar enough to realize we need to investigate it fast.”

”You are right, ” I said, as I whipped my tears, ”I feel like going back there fast. I do not know if I can handle meeting him once again, but I can not let things go. I should have told you all since I was able to speak once again, when Ruxandra and Adrian brought me in.”

”Can you pray? I think you should. You were able to pray early, when he had his dirty claws on you.” ”I think I can. I mean, I want to, it is wonderful, I had no idea it could be so.”

”And it can be more, much more. We have the Face of God in us, therefore we are made to be hungry for more, and only He can satisfy this hunger, in eternity. More and more, never fully, because that is not possible for any created being, but always more and more, neverending. We are not to be satisfied.” ”You mean Vampires?” ”I mean all who come from Adam and Eve, not just Vampires. We all have this longing for Him in our own nature, in our own being.”

It made sense what she said, although I was unable to understand it completely. She looked at me and I expected something, but I did not know how to formulate it, as not even my mind could understand it. I let my heart open and waited. Helena stood down, took me on her lap spoke out what I waited:

”You told me that, when you were young, you were taken to the Presbyterian church.” ”I was but, as far as I remember, my parents took me to various churches of various confessions.” ”Have you been baptized? Presbytherians, as far as I know, do baptize babies.” ”I do not know, I suppose so.”

 ”I shall say it. You have seen the presence of God, His work. Do you believe in Him?” ”I do!” ”Do you receive my testimony on Christ? You know I am Christian.” ”I receive it, as I live it, and I live it now!” Helena's eyes shone.

”Do you know the difference between confessions, between the Orthodoxy, Catholicism and the different Protestant confessions?” ”I know they are different, but not much into them, I know the churches look different.” Helena started to explain me, starting from the Nicene Creed, about Orthodoxy and how it was different from Catholicism, the various Protestant confessions and other confessions, like the non-Calchedonian churches, pretty brief, but on point. As she explained, my longing started to take a clearer shape. It felt like coming up a hill, gently, towards the summit. In the end, she eventually said: ”You know I am Orthodox and my testimony is in Orthodoxy. I *call you* now, my little sister, to come to Orthodoxy, to the faith that our Lord Jesus Christ gave to us to His Church, the Orthodox Church.”

She pointed her hand to me: ”If you accept my calling, take my hand.” and smiled. I knew this is what was supposed to happen and, without even thinking about it, I took her hand. It was a moment of light that could have gone any other way. She embraced me in silence and whispered: ”Praise be The Lord!” I felt like, through her, a power embraced me. I felt like a baby in her mother's arms. Now, I really could not handle this moment to end, I wanted to  last and last... I wanted to fall asleep in there, as now I knew I was *happy*, like never in my life. And, yet, I felt something else needed to happen after this. 

We, eventually, break the embrace. The state diminished a bit and, at that moment, a car passed on a slow speed on the street. A strike of anxiety, not strong, but clearly visible came to me. ”What is it?” she asked. I answered: ”It felt like something passed with that car, that it was there. Faint, but I felt it. Have you felt it too?” ”I did. I do not pay much attention, I pray a bit and they usually go away or fade away. But I do try to remain conscious when it happens, as things can go bad easily, if we are not careful.” 

”You know, I felt that, when it passed, if it stopped and came to me, I would not be able to stop it or even fight on my own with it:” ”Without the help of The Lord, we would not be capable of anything at all. The smallest of Demons is powerful enough to destroy the whole Earth.” A cold chill came upon my spine, but Helena continued, smiling: ”But The Lord does not let them. They can only act as He allows them to. He can allow them to act as a rebuke or punishment for us but also to allow us to fight in Him, be victorious in Him and, therefore, be formed in Him, to be sculpted by both Him and ourselves. So, be courageous in Him, not in yourself.” 

All that sounded wonderful and empowering in a new way, but I felt I had to press on: ”When it came earlier to me, I think I felt something in you, something I did not have. I know that I do not have either now. What would it be?” ”Perhaps the fact that you have not been through the Sacraments of Baptism, Chrysmation and Eucharist. Usually, newly converts, with the exception of babies, are held in a period of learning, before going through Baptism and becoming members of Orthodox Church. Now, you seem pretty mature to me, I think you can pass through it pretty fast, but it has to be done. I shall call father George, my confessor, and give him the news about you.”

As Helena called father George, I anxiously listened to all they said. Somebody else stopped near the fence, talking on the phone. I could feel a disturbing presence outside, I whispered: ”Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me, a sinner.”. I felt better, I could hold on to it, as the presence was still felt outside. I felt power, but it was not like when Helena prayed. The man left and the presence drifted away with him. Helena finished the conversation on the phone and said: ”Father George will do his best to arrive tomorrow, to talk to you. We need to be awake during the day, but we can handle it, I think.” I told her about the presence. She looked worried at me.

”Something is going on.” she said. ”It is not strong, but it is there. I asked you about being baptized, because there are two ways in the Orthodox faith of receiving a former non-Orthodox Christian to Orthodoxy. Baptism is a Sacrament that only happens once. If that person was baptized in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, they can be accepted only having Chrysmation, according to some. Others think the solution is a full Baptism and Chrysmation. But, if the person was never baptized like that, a full Baptism is required for sure

You see, since Adam, we have fallen. Until Baptism, Satan speaks to our heart from the inside, and Christ from outside. After Baptism, Christ speaks to us from inside our heart, and Satan from outside.” ”I want to be Baptized! As fast as possible!” ”Usually, you would have to learn about Orthodoxy before but, in case of emergency, the Baptism can be performed even before. I think father George shall agree to perform it faster. In dire situations, when no clergy is present, even a layperson can perform the Baptism.”

My heart was eager: ”Can you do it? I am afraid, I feel their presence. I want it, I want to be with Christ right now! Until morning a lot can happen!” Helena looked at me thoughtfully: ”Well, my heart feels like answering your call, but I am not sure if this is a true emergency. Yet, as I look into your eyes, I feel something. Please let me pray for a few minutes.” She went into another room, while I anxiously waited. I felt the presence of demonic forces not very far. I prayed silently to The Lord to grant me my wish now, as I wanted to unite with Him.

Finally, Helena came in, smiling, holding a cup in her hand and said: ”I shall do it.” I jumped with joy. She lit a candle with her powers that was already in the room.

”Now”, she said, ”I shall unite the formulas for a potential unknown previous Baptism and for emergency Baptism. I hope it is ok. I think I shall ask you some questions before, three times, like when the priest asks the adults who are about to be Baptized, as it makes sense to me. Sit on your knees, in front of me.”

I did it, as my heart was beating fast. She asked me the first question three times: ” Do you renounce Satan and all his works?” Each time I said wholeheartedly: ”I do!”, then she asked me the second question, three times, almost shouting: ”Do you unite with Christ?” ”I unite with Christ!” 

Helena took water from the cup and sprinkled me with holy water once (I did not care of the burning sensation I felt, being a Vampire): ”The servant of God Alice is baptized in the name of The Father! Amen!” then she sprinkled me the second time: ”And The Son! Amen!”, then she sprinkled me for the third time: ”And The Holy Spirit! Amen”.

At that moment, something happened that I can not describe

. In a way, it felt like nothing at all but also, like everything happening. Myself and the whole world *turned inside-out* in such a wonderful way, I could not describe. My whole being to the smallest cell was changed. It was beyond my wildest expectations. Although I did not see or hear anything, it was like a gateway to Heaven opened above my head and The Lord caressed me, gently, yet strongly beyond comprehension. I felt so loved and fulfilled that my heart felt like exploding in my chest, and yet all was so gentle.

Helena put aside the cup and kneeled next to me. We sensed each other, that deep love and presence engulfing us and through us. Helena whispered: ”Praise be The Lord!” I  whispered back: ”Praise be The Lord!” and we went silent. Can I describe more? Not much, I feel powerless in doing it. Even the tears got dry. All I dare to say is that it was a *happiness beyond happiness*.

I do not know how much it took, it felt like both a very moment, but also something very long. In the end, it got less intense, slowly, although it did not leave us. It became a discrete peace, where we looked at each other, as we were back in our ordinary existence, albeit I was not the same and I could never be the same. Helena smiled and said: ”Welcome home, my little sister.”

This is how I end today. I have more to say, of course, but I really feel like stopping in here. Take care of you, of your soul, of your loved ones and never give up.

God bless!
