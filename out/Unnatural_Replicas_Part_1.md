I woke up with my head hurting like hell , Must be due to the damage I took while [fighting Dave](https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/s/SPgUYnIPiy)


I felt cool breeze on my head , I looked up and saw that my car that used to have a roof no longer has one. 


"Woke up?" A voice said 


I got up and saw that the man who was driving spoke to me.


"I think you guys already know enough about me , So I do not need to introduce myself." He said.


Of course, The only man who managed to wield the power of an unnatural without handing over control. There's no way we wouldn't know about him.


"Try anything funny and it's not going to end up well for you" he said , in a more serious tone. 


"Where are we going?" I asked


"To a safe place." He replied


"What do you plan to do with me?" I asked


"Nothing much , Just ask you about stuff. Actually let's start right now , Tell me about UNF" He said.


I shut up , There's no way I'm leaking anything to him. He's an enemy who's working against us afterall.


After a few seconds of silence he spoke again 


"Tough nut to crack huh, How about you tell me why you joined UNF?" 


I didn't utter a word yet again.


"Why would an academically smart student with a bright future ahead associate with lunatics who worship those weird murdering creatures?" He asked


"Unnaturals are the future. 'Academically smart' and 'bright future' mean nothing in the world they'll create." I replied. 


"I highly doubt that" He replied.


"Your investigator skills are useless in these matters. The only reason you're alive is because one of those 'weird murdering creatures' is your hand , Quite an hypocrite aren't you?" I replied.


I suddenly flung into the seat in front of me after the car suddenly stopped.


"Hey! Don't stop the car so suddenly!" I yelled at him.


His gaze was fixed on the road , as if he was looking at something. So I looked towards the road.


There was a man standing there , He didn't seem particularly threatening or anything. But something about his presence was offputting.


"I SURVIVED THE BLACK LETTER" He yelled. 


After hearing that , Tracey left the driving seat and went towards the man. They both started talking to each other , Their conversation was inaudible to me.


Suddenly a phone rang , not mine. Seemed like Tracey left his phone , The call was someone called Daniela. I picked up.


"Hello?" I said


"Who's this?" A female voice replied.


"I'm Britney" I replied.


"Where's Tracey?" The voice asked.


"He's talking to some guy who apparently survived the black letter." I replied.


"No no no. YOU MUST WARN HIM , THATS NOT-" 


Suddenly the car went backwards and I accidentally hung up the call.


When I looked forward , Tracey had gotten smashed into the windshield of the car. The man standing in front with his leg up in the air , Smiling towards [us.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnnaturalUniverse/s/DxdYzXM9C2)
