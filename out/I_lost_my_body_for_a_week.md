I’m writing this with what little energy I have left. I’m hoping that the police will find this, or someone will read, and take what I have to say at face value instead of writing me off as deranged or adding this to their file of well-kept secrets. 

Realistically, I couldn’t blame them if they didn’t listen. It was me on the house alert cameras entering his home, and it was my own body that sat as he screamed and kicked and grasped at air that couldn’t save him. 

But I did not kill Rick.

You never imagine that the things you see online in news articles or on the big screen of your local theater will happen to you. There’s always a form of disconnect, we as a species live under the impression that we are invincible. I lived under that impression. 
That feeling of being untouchable didn’t shield me. 

It was a week ago, I think, and I was sitting in my own apartment alone. That wasn’t uncommon for me, I enjoyed spending my nights isolated with whatever show or movie I was interested in at the time. After a long day of suffering through college, it’s the least I could do for myself. While I did occasionally dabble in psychedelics, tonight was not one of these nights and I know what I went through had to be real. 

What happened next was unusual at best. 
At first I just assumed there was an issue with the internet, Spectrum sucks and it isn’t exactly surprising when your TV starts to glitch and pixelate. When it switched entirely to static, I began to worry and attempted to turn the TV off and on, something that in hindsight seems idiotic.

Right around this time, the lamp on my side table finally caught my attention. It progressively got brighter, far brighter than i thought was even possible for a household lamp.

All around me, any light that was on began to grow from a low dim to a blinding, buzzing mass. My ears swam as the lights shriek grew louder, I tried to close my eyes but the light showed through my eyelids in oranges and yellows. My senses were being attacked, a heat building under the lights glow so strong that drops of sweat began running down my back and face. 

Then, the lights shattered. And I felt the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. 

My bones felt like they were snapping, just to rejuvenate and break again, my skin stretching to accommodate an entirely new organism. I felt as though my organs were being ripped out and then placed in a new arrangement, one that my body wasn’t meant for. I was Prometheus, and the form entering me was the Eagle tasked with devouring his liver. 

I tried opening my eyes, to identify what was doing this to me, to rationalize the events occurring, and found that even though the bulbs had broken the light present in the living room of that apartment had grown incomprehensibly brighter. I began to feel wet liquid trickling out of my ears and nose, I tried to scream but nothing came out. My lungs were being starved of air but somehow my body persisted. 

I must have lost consciousness at this point, I don’t know how else to explain the deep void in which my being had been transported to. There, in a sea of black, formed a being that the human mind was not intended to comprehend. Something of indescribable horror, of cosmic beauty. The scent of burnt brimstone seeped out of it, but so did the scent of rose gardens. It spoke in a form I couldn’t, or shouldn’t, understand. I heard the sound of the most beautiful music and the guttural screams simultaneously. Even still, I came away knowing that what my future held was something inevitable, something that had to happen. 

Before we continue, let me explain something. Rick was not a good person. This is something I and most people knew. He had done awful things to women, things they couldn’t have stopped if they tried. He had stolen, destroyed, colonized, the bodies of so many. He spent his time lurking at bonfire parties tucked deep into the woods, preying on College and High-School girls despite having graduated decades ago, spiking young women’s drinks and doing unimaginable things to them after. 

It was a common known fact, and even though there had been countless attempts to report his actions, it’s hard to get anywhere when the Sheriff is the one you’re reporting. He continually abused his power, and since it was in small southern town that barely hosted a community college, most followed the timeless Good Ol’ Boy system and were paid for their compliance. His hobby was a constant, it only ever ceased for a few months some time back. 

These were all things I knew. The things I learned of him in the following week, somehow, were even more horrific. 

When “I” woke up the next morning, I found that it was no longer me in control of my actions. I watched myself shuffle out of my bed and into my shirt, saw myself search around my own apartment for the bathroom. I urged my legs to listen to me, to follow my instructions and allow me to regain control, but nothing responded. I vividly remember the fear I felt as I realized that my body was no longer mine. And just as vividly, I remember the sense of an unnatural calm wash over me. 

The following week was a blur. A continuous cycle of panic forced into a box of serenity. After that first night, I know I barely slept if at all. Even though I couldn’t control it, I could feel my body begging for rest. I remember the feelings more than I do the events. But it seems that the thing controlling my corpse insisted on me remembering the worst, most deeply disturbing, parts of that week. 

It was sometime halfway through my
ordeal, I watched my body enter a car and begin driving. It was dark out, the moon watched me with careful eyes as it drove to the edge of town. It didn’t stop, it headed farther into nowhere, driving for what felt like at least an hour. The woods slowly took over as the passing corn fields grew few and far between. Eventually, amidst the sea of shabby dirt roads, my car took a right onto a pathway that I can barely count as drivable. 

I began to panic, something that seemed to happen constantly. Thoughts rushed through my mind, was it coming out here to kill me? Some insane act of suicide, where my body wouldn’t be found for decades? Or was it planning to escape my body, leaving me here alone in the woods at what had to be midnight? My car was getting low on gas, would I even be able to make it back if I tried? All of these things came to me in a flurry of fearful confusion. And all of these thoughts ceased as I watched it stop the car, and walk to my trunk. From there, it retrieved a shovel. I watched thoughtlessly as it began to slowly walk towards a patch in the dirt, one vacant of the leaves and shrubbery surrounding it. And then it dug. We dug and dug until I felt our arms burn and our fingers felt raw against the decaying wooden handle. I dug and I dug and-

The end of the shovel slowly sunk into a squishy mass and a vile, putrid smell began to fill the air. I then knew what it had come for.

Removing the last layer of dirt revealed something I thought I would never have to see. Below its feet was what used to be a girl, with long brunette hair that had once shined in the sun. A maggot filled lesion decorated her neck, her mouth parted to reveal rotting teeth and a partly eaten through tongue. Her eyes, no, her whole body had been turned to food for the bugs. The earth had begun to take back the softer parts of her body, returning them to the soil that had surrounded her. And around her wrist a bracelet twinkled in the moonlight, featuring a pendant engraved with a simple character. 

“R”.

Had I been in control of my body, I would have likely wretched and desecrated her with my vomit. In that moment, for the first time, I felt grateful that this thing had taken over my life. 

After seeing the body, it seemed satisfied with its discovery and began on its way back to the car. I was baffled—why had it come out here, just to stand and stare at a dead girl? Did it just want to traumatize me? Was it taunting me, reminding me that no matter how much I wanted to I couldn’t take control, couldn’t help the girl, couldn’t help myself? Rage boiled inside me, I tried to kick, to push, to move my finger, to look the other way. My mind screamed. 

And nothing happened.

I felt so hopeless. I watched it walk away from the poor girl in the woods—a college girl, just like me—and enter the car again. It felt cruel. It felt miserable. And yet there was nothing I could do to stop the tires from turning and my car moving farther and farther away from her.

At this point, I gave up. I knew that no matter what I did I would never have my body back. The realization that I would live the rest of my life watching the husk I belonged slowly decompose set in. I wouldn’t regain control for the rest of my life and there was nothing I could do but sit there and let everything happen. 

As I watched the farms repopulate the sides of the road and the faint lights of homes streak across my eyes like shooting stars, all I could think about was the young girl that would never again be found. 

A dull ache persisted for the next two days as I watched it go through the motions. Take psych meds, go to school, shower, come home. It was like it had no sensation of my body. It ate regardless of my appetite, starving me when I was hungry just to provide a surplus of food when I felt so sick that, had I been the one in front of the meal, I would’ve pushed it away. It didn’t completely disregard caring for me, I like to believe it held sympathy.

Why it waited so long to kill Rick is something I can’t be sure of. I can’t be sure of most things regarding it. What I can be sure of is that on the sixth night of this torture, or I guess today, I found it standing silently outside of his house.

He had a Wife, but for obvious reasons they weren’t very close. She often spent her nights at a home that wasn’t hers. There had been some local paper scandal in which she was spotted with the other man, but Rick did nothing to stop her and she continued with her affair, albeit with more stealth. 

Tonight was one of the many nights that her car was missing from the driveway. It took me into his home, the front door was locked but it found a window. I find it ironic that the sheriff didn’t check the window. Even thought he was aware of the cruelty he had set upon the earth, of the hatred his own town possessed for him, he still had such confidence in his own untouchability that he didn’t bother to check the latches on his windows.

It body slipped itself through said opening into what seemed to be a sort of library or lounge area. It made no effort to avoid noise, I guess it was aware that this wasn’t a concern. It walked through his house, passing the living room that he had left the TV on in. I watched as it walked up the stairs and progressed to a room that radiated the stench of alcohol. The door was slightly ajar, glimpses of yet another TV’s flashes seeped out of the crack. I knew that it was here to kill Rick, that was obvious. But as it calmly opened the door and allowed him to see it, disregarding any form of concealment, I began to worry. That’s when the TV switched to static and I once again watched the lamp on his nightstand began to grow brighter and brighter. 

Horror clouded my mind as I began to feel what had to be my stomach being ripped slowly up, through my esophagus, and out of my mouth. I tried to close my eyes as the light grew brighter but I couldn’t. My retinas burned, and my body began to fold into itself. I felt like a can crushed under someone’s foot, I once again felt my bones snapping as this thing left my body. My eyes stung, my ears rang, I think Rick was screaming. And then, as the bulbs cracked, this thing slipped out of my body and released such a powerful light that my eyes started bleeding even though they had only been open to witness it for the shortest second. I fell to the ground and for the first time in days, raised my own hands to cover my face. 

I can’t tell you exactly what it did to Rick, there was no way I could have seen it. But I can tell you that I heard him scream as his body squelched. I heard his flesh sizzle. I saw the light through my eyelids as it moved to touch him. I listened as his throat went hoarse, as his bones snapped as mine had. Except his would never be repaired.

After the light finally disappeared I didn’t move. I sat, rocking back and fourth with my
knees pulled to my chest and my eyes pressed into them, for what felt like hours. I sobbed, and then I’d sit in silence, just to break down into the same animalistic cries again. Why no neighbors called 911 I’m not sure. Maybe we had all been secretly hoping for this, begging for someone to finally take the revenge that we prayed for in church every Sunday but unwilling to be the instrument that carried it out.

Slowly the events put themselves together, my mind gathered the stories that had been told about the man across the room for me. I processed the girl I had seen, the pendant with that small engraving. The conclusion I came to is that the girl I found must have been more than his usual victim. The pendant suggested that they may have had a relationship, one that she must have tried to escape. And she paid the price for her attempt to return to a normal youth. 

When I finally allowed my eyes to see the light, when I blinked away the blood that clouded them and they adjusted to the scene before me, I did not hold back the bile that rose in my throat. 

Rick was in a state I cannot fully describe. I don’t know if I would even had I been given the words to relay the scene that lies in front of me. 

And now I am sitting here, next to a pile of my own vomit, writing this and hoping that someone will understand that I didn’t do this. That some soldier of revenge had come down and used my body to carry out a mission assigned to it, to bring justice. I am praying, God please hear me, praying that someone will believe me and know that I am not crazy when I say I had been possessed.
