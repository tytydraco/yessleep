I got a job as a night-shift nurse a few months ago, at the southern hospital.  
The job seemed simple: I worked in the coma patient area. I only had to keep them clean, change IVs, and check their vital signs from time to time to make sure none of them died on my shift.  
A dream, compared to what the poor nurses in the emergency room go through. One quit after a patient faked a seizure, preventing her from tending to a child with a severe allergy. The child didn’t make it. The man who faked the seizure walked home like nothing happened. Those kinds of things happen sometimes.  
It was a normal, boring job—if it weren’t for Mrs. Esposito.

She was a patient who had been in this section for over a year. I was told she’d had a domestic accident, though no one knew exactly what happened. She spent two days lying on the floor of her house without medical care until her son came back from a trip and found her there. The diagnosis: a traumatic brain injury that left her in a coma.  
Her family, like most here, rarely visits. So, in a way, I’m her only company.

Over time, I realized… she wasn’t in a coma.  
Let me explain.

On October 3rd, during my night rounds, I could’ve sworn I saw her sit up in her bed out of the corner of my eye—I even heard the bed creak. I froze. Slowly turned, but when I looked, she was as peaceful and still as ever. I thought I imagined it. Continued my rounds, nervous but relieved.  
A few uneventful days passed, and I assumed it was just my messed-up sleep schedule—being a lonely woman in a big city can mess with your head.

But on October 10th, from the desk overlooking the patient ward, I saw her through the glass. She was standing. That shouldn’t have been possible given the muscle atrophy in her legs. She stood facing the window, looking right at me. Her sparse hair exposed her scalp, her glassy eyes, dry lips, skin white as paper.  
I jumped up, thinking she might’ve woken from the coma. I walked toward the ward, her gaze fixed on me. I opened the door. Inside, she was lying down, in a coma like always.  
I checked her pulse. Everything normal.  
When I stepped out, I looked at her through the glass again. She was lying down, but her eyes were open—staring at me. She smiled, revealing a row of yellow teeth.  
Terrified, I ran to the guard booth. He gave me coffee and, after listening with a pitying look, told me about the previous nurse.

Pamela worked at the hospital for six months. She started out fine, but by the third month, she was different—said the patients moved, talked to her, asked her for impossible things, promised things. She kept coming… until one day, she killed a patient. Smothered him with a pillow.  
When they found her, she was calm. She only said, “Mr. Guzmán woke up and went home.”  
“She was my friend,” the guard told me. “She’s in a mental institution now. I don’t know why you want to keep this job, but whatever you do, don’t talk to her. Don’t listen to her. And never look back if you hear her walking behind you.”

I wanted to quit, but I needed the job so badly I promised myself I’d stay until the end of the month. I clung to my routine. My shifts. The other patients.  
On October 17th, I saw her walking again. I was cleaning up spilled IV fluid when her bed creaked. I turned. She was sitting. Her head tilted, her mouth muttering something.  
I hurried to the desk. I heard her behind me. Then she spoke, her voice like dry leaves:  
"Why are you afraid, if you’re alone too?"  
I covered my ears. Started reciting my routine out loud just to drown her out. I walked to the desk, counting to 100 until the whispers faded.  
I only heard one thing:  
“Join me.”

Days went by. Almost hypnotized and less frightened, I began watching her more closely. Studying her. Understanding her.  
It wasn’t rage in her eyes. It was longing. A deep desire. She didn’t seem to want to hurt me: she wanted me to see her. To understand.  
And I started talking to her whenever I had the chance.  
Small things at first: “Good night,” “It’s a sunny day.” Then longer phrases. Sometimes I thought she answered… not with words, but subtle changes in the room: dimmer lights, a paler patient, a shadow moving down the hall.

On October 24th, I saw her again. I noticed the pattern: she only woke on Mondays. She stood, lips moving, but no sound came out.  
I stood, crossed the ward, and entered the room. She looked at me with that expression of hers: part mother, part executioner.  
I approached.  
“What do you need?” I asked.  
She smiled.  
“Thank you,” she replied.  
She turned and walked to a new patient’s bed—a teenager who’d crashed his motorcycle two days ago. She pressed her hand into his chest. Didn’t pierce it—just merged with him. The boy opened his eyes and stood up.  
“Where am I?” he asked.  
And walked out of the ward.  
I turned to look at his bed: the body was still there... dead. No vital signs.  
Mrs. Esposito had returned to her bed almost instantly. She looked a bit more alive.

After filling out the paperwork and explaining to the doctors how a supposedly stable patient had suddenly died, I was finally able to go home and rest. That night I dreamed of her. In my dream, she looked younger, dressed in scarlet, walking to a table with three place settings. She served me a plate in the center.  
“Join us,” she said.

The whole thing intrigued me more than it scared me. I researched her file. There was only one contact: her son.  
He lived far away, so that weekend I drove several hours to a small house on the outskirts of a nearby town. A young, handsome man answered. Luis Esposito.  
I introduced myself, but he interrupted me—he seemed to be expecting my visit.  
“You’re the new Pamela?”  
I went in, and after offering me a glass of water, he started talking about his mother.  
“She’s a witch—and not figuratively. Literally. My grandfather, her son, buried her in the garden after knocking her unconscious. She was cruel and sadistic. According to my grandfather, she and her mother—also a witch—were seeking a daughter. So, when she got pregnant, they thought they’d succeeded. Something about a triple goddess, I heard once. But when she gave birth to a boy, their plans fell apart. She tried everything to have a daughter, but time was unkind. As the years passed, her mother gave up, embraced her humanity, and died. But not her—she wanted to extend her youth and fertility at any cost. Even forced my grandfather to… you know, try to give her a daughter. Must’ve been hard for him. One day, under too much pressure, he smashed her head against the wall until she stopped moving. Buried her in the garden, as I mentioned. But she kept appearing.  
Whispers at night, the stench of smoke and rot, apparitions in dreams, shadows moving in empty rooms. Every day was a new torment.  
Over time, the manifestations lessened. By the time my grandfather had my father, she only showed up four days a week.”

“Wait—your grandfather’s mother? How long has she been in a coma?” I asked.  
“She’s been in that state for over 60 years.”  
“And how did she end up in the hospital?”  
“Because she didn’t die, as you’ve seen. When my grandfather died, my father unearthed her—and her body was intact. Warm. No trace of worms. He tried treating her well, thinking it would make it stop. But she killed my siblings, caused miscarriages... she was looking for her daughter. My father realized there was no way to contain her hunger, so he faked an accident and pushed her down the stairs. That’s how she ended up in the hospital. Since then, we move her every so often. Her astral visits diminished with time.  
When I was a kid, I remember seeing her—like a rotting corpse—staring at us through the living room window, licking the glass. The image still haunts my dreams.  
We believe the longer she remains in that state, the weaker she becomes—until one day, she finally dies. Honestly, it had been so long since I’d seen her that I was starting to forget about it... until Pamela.  
And now you.”

“And why do I see her in my dreams?”  
“Because you didn’t run. Because you speak to her. Because you… listen. Tomorrow is October 31st. Tell me—what are you going to do?”

**Monday, October 31st.**  
As soon as I was alone, I entered Mrs. Esposito’s room. I sat beside her. She took my hand. Her skin was warm, full of life.  
“What do you want from me?” I asked.  
She smiled. Sat up. Put her mouth to my ear.  
And spoke of power.  
Of words that open wounds in reality, names that burn in the bones, symbols drawn in old blood, chants that make saints weep.  
She told me of temples buried in cities not yet born, of doors that turn inside mirrors, of dreams that bite.  
She showed me—without words—how souls can be emptied like cups. How a daughter can be born from the void, from hunger, from ancestral hatred.  
I saw myself: transformed. Stronger. Freer. More *me*.  
And I accepted.

**Tuesday, November 1st.**  
Ten patients dead.  
One nurse and one patient missing.  
Security footage shows Lucía Paz, night-shift nurse at the southern hospital, leaving the building hand in hand with Mrs. Julieta Esposito—who walked as if nothing were wrong.  
The footage captured her turning to the camera and smiling.  
When questioned, the guard said he heard screams that night coming from the coma ward—cries of pain from many people and chants in a language he didn’t understand. But when he looked through the window, he saw only darkness.  
When he entered, he found Lucía holding a scalpel. Calmly cutting the last living patient, like a seamstress.  
Beside her stood Mrs. Esposito. The old woman whispered a word.  
The guard collapsed, mouth full of ashes.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Friday, November 4th.**  
Massacre at Luis Esposito’s home.  
The house was invaded during the early morning.  
His body was found in fetal position—inside the oven. Signs of cannibalism and torture. He was in such a state he had to be identified by fingerprints and dental records.  
Curses were written on the walls in ashes.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mrs. Esposito is feeling much better. She eats ravenously and grows stronger every day.  
After helping her get up at the hospital—and helping the other patients go… home—I took her back to her old house where she finally made peace with her family.  
I’m so happy to help her. She’s so wise and powerful.  
We prepared an altar with boiled bones from a family member. Drew with the dried blood of forgotten saints.  
Each night we sit to read the names no one should utter anymore.  
She’s taught me to see the world differently: with my eyes closed, from within, as if flesh were just a passing layer.  
She’s promised I’ll become so powerful that people will obey with a whisper from my lips.  
To speak with the wind, read the stars, sing chants that make our will heard, summon familiars, and travel astrally.  
The time is near.  
She only asked one thing in return: A daughter.  
Maiden, mother, crone.
