Hello again.  
Sorry for the delay in updating, but things around here have been quite chaotic lately (which I think will become clear as you read today's account). For those who haven’t read Part 1, you can find it \[[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kryji9/the_word_he_wrote/)\]. Well, since that night (where he stood staring at me at the door), the boy no longer draws. He just watches. He watches me.

I simply decided to sleep (at least try) after seeing him there, standing still. I must have dozed off at some point, and when I woke up, he was still peacefully sleeping in his bed, his hands dirty with mud. I considered it might’ve been a hallucination, a trick of the light or something, but after breakfast, I found another paper under the door. A drawing. A spiral… but now made of tiny faces. Some crying. Others… smiling. It was disturbing in a way I can’t explain. Very scribbled lines, chaotic and orderly at the same time.

I wanted to leave. I asked for a transfer, but they said it was impossible: the road had been bombed. We’ll be isolated for at least two weeks if we’re lucky. The radio keeps emitting nothing but static. The generator failed twice last night, and I don’t know how long the internet will last.

Given the situation, I tried to keep my sanity by staying busy with the children. Ramires does what he can, but I know he’s growing paranoid too. He’s locked the pantry door with a chain. Says he heard "something moving inside." And to be honest, if the experience of war was already stressful, now no one really sleeps anymore.

Yesterday, I attempted another session with the boy. He agreed to come into the office. I closed the door and entered, starting the voice recorder (just as a routine), not expecting him to speak.

But he did.

**\[AUDIO TRANSCRIPT – SESSION 06 – 08:42 AM\]**

**ME:** It's okay, no pressure today. If you want to draw, everything’s here.  
\[Sound of a chair creaking\]  
**ME:** Can I ask you something? Just one thing?  
\[6 seconds pause\]  
**ME:** Why always that word? "Below"? What’s down there?

\[5 seconds of silence. Then the sound of something being dragged across the table—a pen.\]

**BOY:** (hoarse, low voice)  
— They whisper.

**ME:** Who? The soldiers?

**BOY:**  
— No… the people in the well.

\[Sound of a held breath, followed by the chair being pushed back as the boy stands up.\]

**ME:** What do they say?

**BOY:**  
— That she brought me. That they’re hungry.

**ME:** Who is “she”?

**BOY:**  
— The woman with the long hair.

**\[END OF TRANSCRIPT\]**

My blood froze. I remembered the drawing slipped under my door, the woman kneeling at the well… I had no idea what it could be, but many hypotheses worried me. Was it a delusion from his child mind? A projection of a maternal figure he developed to comfort himself while awaiting a slow death in that pit? Could there have been someone else with him in the well, someone who wasn’t rescued? Or perhaps… something worse.

That night, everything got worse.

The basement started to stink. Like rotting meat, but wetter, thicker. We sent someone to check, a caretaker named Mila. She went down alone, with a flashlight. She said she didn’t see anything, but came back white as a ghost, trembling. Said “the iron door was open.”

I didn’t know there was an iron door. In fact, no one did. The basement has shelves, sacks of flour and medicine, most of it expired or broken, but we had never seen a door. Mila locked herself in the bathroom for quite a while. When she came out, she just repeated: “that thing is still… below.” We have no more meds for breakdowns. I gave her tea and tried to talk to her. She stared blankly, her eyes wide, without saying a word.

After everyone was asleep (or at least tried to be), I went down. I took Ramires with me, he was fed up too and wanted to understand what the hell was going on. We descended into the basement and yes, there *is* an iron door, hidden behind a pile of old archive boxes. He helped me move them, and even though it was slightly ajar, it was extremely heavy.

The smell of mold and dampness hit me like a punch to the nose, making my whole respiratory tract burn. On the other side, stone steps descending into darkness. No light. No sound. Hanging from the handle on the inside, on a child’s cloth cord: a broken crucifix, dirty with soil and… some dark liquid. I went down a few steps just far enough for Ramires' flashlight to light the way. Before I could go any further, he touched my shoulder. “We shouldn’t go in.”

“But,” I protested, “what if there’s something here, or someone, causing interference with the signal? It wouldn’t be the first time a threat’s invaded the house…”

Before I could finish, though, we heard a sound echoing from below. We fell silent, holding our breath. It was a constant, rhythmic sound, and after a few seconds, I recognized it as… footsteps.

They were getting closer, and Ramires pointed his light in their direction. I saw his expression change, his eyes widening like Mila’s, his jaw dropping. The footsteps were near very near when they stopped. I could feel a presence, someone standing right behind me. I felt the hairs on my body rise, a dreadful feeling crawling up my spine. I wanted to turn around, to see what had left him paralyzed, but my colleague wouldn’t let me. He grabbed my wrist fast, pulling me up three steps at once and slamming the door shut even before I was fully out.

Something on the other side was pushing, struggling for control. It was strong and it was winning. I staggered, regaining my balance and running to help him. A few more hits nearly knocked us over, but we finally managed to lock the latch on the door. The thing stopped shortly after that. I was shaking, just gathering enough strength to look at Ramires and ask:

“What the hell *was* that?”

He didn’t answer. He just stared at me with a paralyzed, catatonic look. I wouldn’t be getting an answer anyway, so I just walked him to his room and then went to mine.

I got to my room. The door creaked behind me, and I leaned against it for a while, trying to calm my frantic heartbeat. Only the distant sound of the wind against the roof tiles and the metallic hum of the dying generator kept me company.

I couldn’t sleep, so I picked up an old book someone had left in the common room. A technical volume about geological formations (I know, nothing to do with me, but it helped pass the time). I was flipping through it absentmindedly when I stopped on a page marked by a subtle fold. It was a map. The legend indicated points of seismic instability in war zones. And among them… our region. An unnamed area stretched from the forest near our shelter to the attacked village. A blank hole where relief should’ve been. No city, no road. Just a footnote:

"Unstable tectonic depression, possibly cavernous. Access forbidden since 1971 after subterranean collapse. Mapping incomplete."

At the bottom margin, someone had scribbled a note in messy handwriting:

“It’s not just the ground that gives way. The Saint whispers her words through these airs.”

I caught myself wondering. What Saint? What else gives way besides the ground? I tried to find more notes in the book, but nothing. Only on the back cover did I find what I needed: a name. The name of the book’s former owner: **Father Laszlo Yakub**. The name wasn’t unfamiliar. I remembered a monastery nearby that used to care for the children before we got here.

I was still sitting on the bed thinking about it when the lights flickered, and for a second, everything went dark. And in that moment, that exact instant of total blackout, I felt something that shattered my convictions, if I could even trust what my senses perceived.

It was the precise sensation that the room had gotten larger, as if the walls had pulled away. The wood groaned, creaking, and the floor trembled like a growling engine. I tried to stand up—and that’s when the house seemed to tilt. I slid backward, hit my head on the bed frame, and blacked out completely.

I woke up this morning, the back of my head throbbing. I jumped up with a cry, trying to grab onto something, escape a collapsing building—but everything was normal. I planted my feet more firmly on the floor, rubbing the wound on my head and wondering if it had all been a hallucination…

Then I heard knocks at the door, followed by Ramires' voice:

“Are you okay, Doctor? Can I come in?”

“Ah… yes,” I replied.

He opened the door. His eyes were still uneasy, disturbed—but better than last time.

“We have a visitor,” he said.

“Great! Did the NGO team arrive?” I asked, hopeful that this nightmare might soon be over.

“Not exactly…” his voice grew more serious. “Father Laszlo is here, and he wants to speak with you.”
