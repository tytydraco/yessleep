When I was a kid, I wanted nothing more than whatever the newest, most popular toy was at the time. Action figures, playhouses, stuffed animals — as long as it had a cool commercial, I wanted it. My parents even had a running joke about it, that they didn’t need to ask me for Christmas or birthday lists. They’d just have to turn the TV on and see what toy commercials came on. And in winter of 2009, when I was five years old, the new hit toy of the Christmas season was Bugzzy.

Bugzzy was not, as the name suggested, a bug. No, he was a stuffed animal. I can’t really tell you what he looked like. He was a weird little fantasy creature, like if you fused every cutesy woodland animal you could think of together into one easily marketable toy. Big snout, fluffy tail, cute little fangs that were stitched into the fabric. But Bugzzy wasn’t just any toy, no.

Bugzzy could move!

This… wasn’t too impressive on its own. Toys could move around on their own for a while now. Things like Furbys could open their mouths and blink and tell you to feed them. The commercials showed Bugzzy walking and jumping and waving hello, though, so I was enthralled. Who knew a toy could do all that?

Looking back, my parents probably thought it was bullshit. But, I wanted him, and he wasn’t too expensive, so I was pleased to open one of my presents on Christmas morning that year only to find myself face to face with the adorable little gremlin himself. I was overjoyed. I opened the box as fast as I could, even before I looked at the rest of my gifts.

The box said that the batteries were included, thankfully, so I immediately flipped the switch on the back of his left foot and watched Bugzzy come to life.

At first, he didn’t do anything. I flipped the switch on and off a few more times, thinking that it would help somehow. Eventually I decided to leave it in the ON position while I set it aside and opened my other gifts.

Once I had opened the others, I was about ready to give up on Bugzzy. Just then, though, my mom pointed at it.

“Look! Look, it’s moving!”

I whipped my head around to see Bugzzy sitting up against the table leg where I’d set him down. His left arm was pointing right at me.

He started doing other things once I started playing with him. He didn’t get up and dance around like in the commercials, but he waved and kicked his little feet and nodded his head to the beat of some inaudible song. I loved it. I loved my other gifts too, of course, but Bugzzy was something else.

Before I took all my toys up to my room so I could play with them, my mom showed me the little instruction booklet that came with Bugzzy. It was all the standard stuff. Turn off when not in use, don’t machine wash, all that. She specifically pointed out that I couldn’t keep Bugzzy too warm. The booklet said that it could mess with his movement. I liked to sleep with my stuffed animals in bed, so this was important. I didn’t want to break Bugzzy.

I spent the whole rest of the day in my room playing with my new toys. I had robot battles, lined up all my toy soldiers, and most importantly, played with Bugzzy. I had figured out the key to his movement fairly quickly. Whenever I put my hand up to him, he would move. If it was close to his head, his head would bonk up against it. If it was close to his arm, he’d point. If I moved it up and down, he’d bob his head.

This new information made playing a whole lot easier. I could make Bugzzy do all these little movements on command. He could even salute all the little soldiers! I played into the night. It was one of the best Christmases I’d ever had.

By the end of the day I had all my toys lined up nice and neat on my soft and cozy carpet. I slept like a baby that night.

Bugzzy became a fast favorite of mine over the next few weeks. I showed him to all of my friends and family. I brought him to school for show and tell once, and another kid said she had one too! I ended up making a friend because of Bugzzy. We still talk all these years later.

As the months went by, though, Bugzzy started acting strange.

Sometimes I’d find him in different places around my room than where I’d left him. He’d be at one corner of my bed when I left for school, and when I got back home he’d be in the center. He’d be on the top shelf of my closet when I went to bed, and when I woke up he’d be face-down on the floor. One time I thought I’d lost him, but soon found that he’d made his way under my bed.

I asked my parents if they’d been moving Bugzzy while I wasn’t looking, but they denied it. I didn’t believe them at first, but one night I remember being awoken to a thud from the far corner of my room. I flicked on the lights to find Bugzzy laying on the floor, having just fallen from my bedside table. He was face-down, limbs splayed out to either side. It was like he was trying to maximize his body-to-carpet contact. Without thinking, I pulled him into bed with me to cuddle. I had forgotten all about the heat warning.

I fell asleep quickly. It always helped me sleep when I had something warm and fuzzy to cuddle. But once again, I woke up in the middle of the night to something strange. There was a strange tickling sensation on my arm, where Bugzzy was pressed against me tightest. I turned the light on and looked to see if there was a loose stitch or something, but I couldn’t find it. It unsettled me. I put Bugzzy back on the floor and finally got some rest.

The next night I swore I saw him slithering over to the heating vent on his belly like a snake. It was dark, but I know I saw it. It was slow. Sluggish. But he was moving.

After that, I always made sure to keep him in my toy chest whenever I wasn’t playing with him.

As the season turned to summer, we were hit with a massive heat wave. I was walking around the house in my underwear at all times. My diet consisted of 60% ice pops. All the blinds were drawn to keep the sun out, and box fans were running in almost every room. My room was the hottest in the house, much to my displeasure.

On the hottest day of the heat wave, I was up in my room melting into the carpet. I didn’t even have the strength to play with my toys, I was so hot. All I could do was lay on the floor in my undies and talk to Bugzzy.

I remember him looking… bigger than usual. Not by much, but it seemed like he had somehow gotten more thoroughly stuffed since the last time I saw him. Like he was bursting at the seams.

Delirious from the heat, I hugged him close to my chest.

I could feel him moving.

Not like usual, though. He wasn’t just moving an arm or nodding his head. No, this felt different. It was like his body was rippling, bubbling like a pot of boiling water. I rolled over onto my back and held him up over my face at arm’s length. A bead of sweat dripped down the side of my head. I wanted a better look at him.

For a moment, he just rippled there in my hands. That was, until a tiny, black spike poked out from the side of his head.

It bent in the middle and moved back and forth like it was clawing at the hot, humid summer air.

And then another emerged. And another. In an instant, Bugzzy’s body had been pierced all over by these tiny black spikes. One of them brushed up against my hand and in a moment of panic I tensed up, inadvertently squeezing Bugzzy in my grasp.

I heard a soft crunch, like crushing a piece of popcorn between your fingers. Then, a sickening pop as the seam on his neck burst open and a roiling mass of black spiders poured out onto my face like liquid spilling out of a ziploc bag.

I did not close my eyes and mouth in time.

Do you know what it’s like to feel something moving behind your eye? A sharp, spindly leg scraping at your optic nerve? Something trying to crawl down your tongue and down your throat?

In a moment of panic I clenched my jaw to try and keep the things out. I could feel dozens of arachnids pop like a mouthful of tapioca pearls in my mouth. My own screams were drowned out by the sound of these things trying to dig down into my eardrums.

These things wanted to get inside of me. They wanted my warmth. Even the ones that spilled onto the carpet quickly began crawling all over my body and into my eyes, my nose, my mouth, my ears. It felt like for every one I crushed, two more found their way inside of me.

I do not remember much of what happened next. I don’t remember screaming, and I don’t remember my parents rushing to my aid. I know it happened because they told me about it afterwards, but all that is a blur. All I remember is the sensations. Eventually, it was too much to bear and I passed out.

I woke up in the hospital feeling sick to my stomach. A very kind doctor told me that they’d taken care of everything. They had to pump my stomach and flush out my eyes, nose, and ears. Thankfully most of the spiders died pretty quickly. As badly as they wanted heat, they couldn’t handle it. This meant that thankfully, none of them had the chance to lay any eggs. I barely paid attention to what the doctor was saying. All I could think about were those spiders pouring onto me like a thick syrup.

Back at the house, my dad had called pest control to see if they could take care of any remaining spiders. The pest control people looked, but they couldn’t find any. Every single one of Bugzzy’s spiders had made their way inside my body.

It took several weeks for me to recover. Not physically — I was fine after two days in the hospital, but mentally? You don’t forget something like that. I still have nightmares. I still get flashbacks whenever I see a spider. Any bug, really. It’s awful. One look and I’m back in that room, holding Bugzzy over my face.

The toys were recalled. Apparently, it wasn’t just me. I wasn’t the only kid to find out what was inside of those things. Spiders, in every single one of them. One kid choked and died. Another went blind. The company issued a half-hearted apology statement and went under within the week. They didn’t mention the spiders at all, only talking about the incident in the vaguest of terms.

Pretty much everything about the company has been scrubbed from the internet. I can’t even remember their name. Bugzzy’s gone, too, except for a few stories and videos you can find from back before they were recalled. At least, I can only assume so. I can’t ever look at that thing’s smiling face again.

There’s no good place to end this story off. I guess I just needed to get it off my chest. I’d only told it to my parents (who saw it firsthand), my therapist, and that friend I mentioned earlier. She was the kid who went blind, actually. The spiders went straight for her eyes.

Make sure you check your child’s toys carefully around Christmas, I suppose.

I’m going to stop writing now. I feel sick.
