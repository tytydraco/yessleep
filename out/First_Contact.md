For the last two years, I’ve been secretly employed by the US government for locating and retrieving alien spacecraft. Only 4 people including me work at Site 13. Site 13 is located in the deserts of New Mexico, and is where work really gets done, not Area 51. 

The worst part is that no one knows what happens there, it’s only the 3 other guys and me, all of us have sworn to secrecy, and we’ve seen what happens when we tell anyone. Doesn’t matter how close. 

But that doesn’t matter now.

I think it was just a month after we sent out a message that we got our first response.

I was the one that was first on site.

All of us get an urgent call from our boss (whom we don’t know the name of) telling us to arrive on site immediately. I soon found out why.

We were being sent a message, a decipherable one. It was slow, and didn’t work all the time, but it was doing the job. It took maybe 2 hours for the first sentence to be deciphered.

“We’ve seen your call.”

That was when we knew it was real.

The first truly readable transmission was received on that day, definite proof that there was organisms in the universe that could comprehend things like we can.

The protocol fell under a level 4, so the three crew members went out to get more specialists on site.

I was the one that had to help decipher the rest of the message.

That first hit of adrenaline was what helped keep me awake in the beginning. But it takes 2-3 hours to decipher a sentence, and all of that is heavily dependent on a number of factors. And after a while, I fell asleep. 

Obviously not my proudest moment. But we don’t get a lot of sleep in this field of work.

I woke up at 2AM the next morning to the alarms blaring, piercing my ears the second they went off. I checked my phone to see what time it is, and immediately checked the message, trying to read it despite, the alarm. But this time, it said something different.

CORRECTED MESSAGE: 
THIS IS NOT A TEST. Your species is scaled as a 4/5 on our CPAC Scale. We are the dominant species, and therefore, must not let any threats go by. In accordance to the EDPK guidelines, we will be arriving in 1 day for your planet, where we will kill all species in your planet, and will use your home to habit our ever growing empire. PLEASE DO NOT FIGHT BACK.

I couldn’t believe my eyes. I immediately ran for the doors only to find out that the entire facility is on lockdown. After checking the files I was able to find the shutdown code, and quickly punched it in. It worked.

I ran to the firearms section and grabbed any and all weapons I could grab, and deployed an emergency exit vehicle and drove as far as possible. 

It’s been 2 hours, and I’ve just gotten a notification that my house has been broken into. I checked the footage, only to see a huge creature with 6 arms tearing apart my house, as I zoom in, the creature jerks it’s head toward the camera, before it releases its claws towards my camera, and the screen turned black.

It’s been 6 hours since the incident, I’ve ran out of gas and am stuck in the middle of nowhere. I’m writing this as a warning to anyone who sees this. They’re coming, and now all you can do is pray.
