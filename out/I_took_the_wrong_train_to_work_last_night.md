I’m a doctor. A general surgeon, to be specific. I love my job. Helping people has always been my dream, and I don’t believe there is a bigger honor than being able to help people in the way that I do. 

I work in a metropolitan area. We get cases of all kinds, from transplants, to removals, to exploratory surgeries, to everything in between. Sometimes, us surgeons get sent to other hospitals to help out if a patient is critical, and their doctors aren’t available, or can’t do the surgery.

I should have never accepted that assignment. We got the call at around 10 PM last week, the hospital on the other side of the city needed a general surgeon. A patient urgently needed a kidney transplant, as a viable donor was found, but they got slammed with a full emergency room from a massive pileup on the freeway. 

“I can take it, it’s been Q-U-I-E-T tonight.” I say, carefully avoiding saying *that* word to make sure I don't jinx my coworkers when I leave. 

“Thank you, Dr. Mills, I’ll tell them to expect you and to prep the patient” the charge nurse said to me.

I made my way to the attending lounge to grab my stuff, not expecting to come back to the hospital when I was done with the surgery. I rummaged through my messy locker, and nodded towards my friend and coworker, Dr. Laken. 

“Where are you off to? Leaving us in the dust?” he asked me, a hint of teasing in his voice.

“I wish, kidney transplant at Northside, they’ve got no one who can do it ‘cause of that accident so I get to swoop in and save the day” I explained, trying to find my car keys. 

“Ah, I see,” Dr. Laken replied, “Well, don’t bother trying to find your keys, freeway is closed in both directions ‘cause of the accident, you gotta take the metro or run there.”

“Damnit, seriously?” I groaned. I didn’t want to have to come back to grab my car when I was done. 

“I wouldn’t say it if it wasn’t true.” he said with a shrug, and left the room. 

After hearing that news, I absolutely did not want to go. Not only did I have to come back to get my car after, but I despised taking the metro. Too many freaks who’s actions you couldn’t predict. However, I took that stupid hippocratic oath, and I knew having to take public transportation was not a good enough reason to break it. 

I made my way out of the hospital and walked the short block to the underground metro station. Thank God the stations are so close to the hospitals, having to walk a long distance AND taking the metro would make me quit my job. 

The platform was empty when I got down there. Not unusual, it was half past 10 by the time I got down there, no one wants to be waiting on a train platform by themselves that late if they have a different option.

I scrolled mindlessly through my phone for a few minutes, then tried to make some sort of game plan for the surgery. After a good 15 minutes, I looked up, and noticed that I was still alone on the platform. I should’ve been grateful that there was no one to bother me down here, but it was a little eerie, even for a grown man like me. Then, I heard the distant sound of a train approaching. 

*Finally*, I thought to myself.

The train began to pull into the station, and I immediately noticed it looked different. It had no metro logos on it, and the windows, which were a lot smaller than normal, were higher up the cars as well. I noticed that they were heavily tinted as well, I couldn't see inside the cars at all. But it was on the platform that went by the other hospital, so I knew it had to be my train.  

*Maybe they finally started to revamp these old-ass trains*, I thought, trying to calm myself down.  

I waited for the doors to open at an appropriate distance to make sure people getting off could comfortably leave, but when the doors opened, no one left. I hesitantly stepped on, and noticed that no one got off because there was no one there. In fact, there were no seats in this car, just a couple of those loops hanging from the ceiling to hold on to. 

*What the fuck?,* I thought. 

I tried to rationalize it. Obviously, they’re remodeling the train. So they took the seats out to redo the floors or the walls or whatever. Of course that’s it. 

I grabbed the nearest one of those loops to hold on to, and couldn’t help but notice how cold it was in this train. It was winter currently, but trains have a little bit of heat in them. 

*The remodel*, I thought to myself, *they cut the heat for the remodel*. 

I tried to calm myself down by looking at my phone, trying to find absolutely anything to district me. I played a dumb little game I was probably too old to have on my phone anyway. After a few minutes, I looked up and realized we hadn’t stopped at the next station on the line. 

Maybe I just missed it? No, there’s no way I wouldn't have noticed the train stopping. My adrenaline is already higher than it should be on this train, I would not have noticed something that could’ve calmed my anxiety. 

I put my phone away and looked out the window. We were bound to come up to the next station soon. Maybe it skipped the last one because it was closed. Or for police activity, that happens sometimes too. If it stops at this one, everything will be okay. 

I stared out the window for what felt like forever, but I finally saw a little bit of light coming through the tunnel.

*Great, okay. Almost at the next stop*, I thought to myself. 

But as we pulled into the station, the train didn’t slow down. At all. It blew right through the station without a moment of hesitation. 

*What the fuck is happening??* I was panicking now, wondering what was going on. I had to get to that hospital, people were counting on me. We don’t have express trains in this part of the city, there’s no reason for it to keep skipping these stops. 

I didn’t know what to do. My phone didn’t have service in the tunnel, so I couldn't call anyone. The train was barreling through the tunnel, past another station. I tried to gather myself as best I could. 

There were doors on both ends of the car, I could walk through them no problem. I’ll go to the front of the train, where the conductor is, and ask them what the fuck was going on. I released the hand rail I was holding, and made my way to the door in front of me. It opened like any other train door would, and I walked through to the next car. 

This one was different from the one I got into. It had a very narrow walkway, and what looked to be a wall going down the length of the car next to it. Kind of like what a long-haul train would look like, the kind with cabins in it. It was even colder in this car, I felt it immediately.  

*Ok, so maybe this is a long-haul train. Maybe it stopped at the station by accident, and I shouldn’t have gotten on,* I tried to reassure myself. But why would a long-distance train be on city metro tracks? 

It didn’t make sense, and I knew it didn’t make sense, but none of this made sense and I was desperately trying to figure this out. 

As I slowly walked to the other end of the car, I noticed about halfway down that there was a door in the wall. 

*These must be first-class cabins, if there’s only a single door halfway down the car.* 

I stopped in front of it. There might be someone in there, but what if I opened the door, just a little bit, to see? I was sure that if someone was in there, I could explain to them my confused state and apologize for the intrusion. 

There was a small handle on the door, and I slowly pushed down. I didn’t feel any resistance that would come with the door being locked. I took a deep breath, and opened the door. 

I was blinded by a fluorescent light, it was so incredibly bright in there. There was also a horrific formaldehyde smell. I almost gagged, it was so bad, and I’ve had to have a strong stomach working in an ER. 

I finally opened my eyes, and I almost fell back from what I saw. Body parts and organs were strewn all over the floor of the car. I couldn’t move. They were human, from what I could tell. The body parts for sure, at least. I could see human arms and legs throughout the horrific mess in front of me. 

I couldn’t hold it in, and threw up on the walkway. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, what kind of fucking train is this?

I ran. I abandoned trying to find the conductor, they had to be a part of whatever this sick operation was, and I knew that if they saw that I was here, they’d make sure I join the the mess behind that wall. 

I ran into the next car. It was identical to the one I had just come from. As much as I didn’t want to see what I had just seen again, I had to be sure. I swung the door open, and the scene was the same. Organs and body parts all over the floor. They were more organized here, being thrown into piles on two sides of the car. 

I threw up again, and sank to my knees. I normally hate to admit this, but I was terrified. I had no idea what kind of sick train I had stumbled upon, and whether or not the people who did this were still here. 

I wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but I felt the train slowing down. I gathered myself and stood up, and looked out the window. We were stopping at a station. 

My station. 

This is where I had to get off to get to Northside Hospital. As soon as the trains stopped, I ran to the door and almost pushed it open. I stumbled out onto the platform and fell to my knees, gasping for air, thanking every God I could think of for getting me off the train. 

“Dr. Mills?”, I heard someone say. I looked up and saw a woman standing next to me, looking at me concerned. She was wearing nursing scrubs. 

“Dr. Mills, are you alright?”, she asked, very concerned.  

“We have to- we have to call the police. Or the FBI. Someone, I don’t fucking know!” I tried to get out between my gasps for air. As she looked at me, unsure of what I was talking about, I heard movement in the train car behind me. 

*What the hell? I thought I was alone in there.* 

I turned around abruptly, a little bit of confidence in me now that I was not the only one on the platform, and saw the door to the inside room wide open. A man walked out, holding a cooler. 

“I’ve got a kidney here, you from Northside?” he asked her, not even looking in my direction.

“Yes, thank you!”, the nurse replied, taking the cooler from him. The man got back on the train, and it began to move. 

“How lucky that you arrived with the kidney, you can scrub right in and we won‘t have to waste any time!” she said excitedly. 

She acted so normal, that was what scared me the most. Picking up a kidney from a train filled with organs and limbs was normal. I can never get that thought out of my head, seeing the cars. 

I can barely close my eyes without gagging, let alone force myself into an operating room. But I do notice now, how every time a surgeon has a transplant scheduled, a nurse disappears off the floor for a little while.
