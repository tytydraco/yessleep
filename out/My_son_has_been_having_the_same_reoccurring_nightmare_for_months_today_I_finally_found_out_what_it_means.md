Brian, my eight-year-old boy, has been suffering from the same nightmare for over two months now. He has it every single night without fail. It always stays the same.

We've been to about a dozen psychiatrists and psychologists, even sleep therapists. Nothing has helped, and Brian refuses to describe his dream. But he finally opened up to a dream specialist yesterday. We found this guy online. My husband was against it, saying the guy looked like a scam artist, but I was desperate, so we drove out there.

"Can you tell me what happens in your dream?" the specialist, who introduced himself as Josh, was interviewing my son, listening intently and taking notes. Brian shifted in his seat, his head dropped down, looking at his lap.

"I'm in bed," he whispered under his breath, his voice trembling.

"And then what?" my husband urged him to continue. He has never been a patient man, and this issue has cost us both dozens of hours of sleep. The doctor gave him a look.

"There's a sound outside my room." I could tell Brian was having a hard time recounting the dream.

"What sound do you hear?" Josh's voice was gentle and slow.

"A creak," and after a short pause, he added, "in the hallway."

Josh nodded, scribbling in his notebook. He wore square thin glasses, and a pair of jeans with a black button-up. Even if he was a scam artist, at least he looked the part.

"Can you tell me what happens next?"

My husband was tapping his foot. I couldn't tell if he was impatient or nervous. We were both sitting a foot behind Brian, facing the doctor.

Brian contemplated for a minute before he spoke up again, this time a little louder than before. "It opens my door."

"The door creaks too." Brian looked up at the doctor for the first time since we started. Josh gave him a light smile. I wondered if Brian smiled back.

"Does something come into your room?" the doctor continued questioning Brian.

"Yes," my son responded quickly, maintaining a tone slightly louder than a whisper.

Josh contemplated for a long moment before he asked his next question, "Can you describe it?"

For the next couple of minutes, we all sat there in silence. I wasn't sure if Brian was even breathing. At some point, he dropped his head back down again.

"That's alright," Josh spoke again. "What else can you tell me?" he added.

Brian made a sound; it sounded like a sigh, but I wasn't confident. "It comes inside my room."

This was the first time we had gotten so far with Brian. Normally, he would get too overwhelmed to continue after telling us about the door creaking open. I was proud of him.

Josh didn't get to ask his next question because my son continued to speak. "It has a red face and glowing red eyes."

"He is tall... taller than Mom."

Josh waited patiently for him to continue, and when Brian didn't, he spoke up again. "What does he do?"

I looked over at my husband. At some point, he took out his phone and was doing something. I couldn't see because he had it tilted away from me. The thought of him cheating crossed my mind.

"He walk- walks up to the foot of my bed," he stuttered out. "He has a scary face."

The doctor uncrossed his legs and leaned forward a little. "Brian, can you look at me?"

My son lifted his head back up and looked at Josh. "What does he look like?" Josh asked him, looking him in the eyes.

"His body is pitch black," Brian replied. "He has long arms with claws instead of fingers on his hands," he added.

Josh nodded, and my son's head dropped back down as if he was in a trance before.

"What does he do next?" Josh leaned back.

"He-" Brian whimpered. It sounded like he was about to cry, like many times before. I considered stopping Josh. We had gotten further than ever before today. I wasn't sure if pushing Brian so much was the right decision. But before I could make a decision, Brian continued.

"He climbs on my bed," he finally whimpered out.

The doctor nodded and stood up. "That's enough for today."

"You did well, Brian," Josh smiled at him. "Do you want some candy?" He pushed the big bowl of chocolate candy towards him. My son wiped his eyes and nodded.

The doctor began walking towards a corner of the room and gestured for us to follow.

Once the three of us were in the corner and far away so Brian couldn't hear us, he flipped through his notes in silence.

"And you said these nightmares began when?"

"Right after his eighth birthday," I responded.

Josh nodded and scribbled in his notebook again.

"Did something traumatic happen during it or shortly after? Maybe he watched a scary movie?"

"No," this time it was my husband responding, his phone was back in his pocket, and he was staring at the doctor.

"Your son seems to be deeply traumatized by this recurring dream of his, so traumatized, in fact, that he has a hard time describing it."

"I said nothing happened," my husband spoke up a little louder. "He just... started having them out of nowhere."

Josh closed his notebook and addressed my husband. "How often do you play with Brian?"

He looked away from the doctor. "Maybe for an hour or two during the weekends."

Josh nodded, and then turned to me. "And how about you?"

"I take him to the park at least three to four times a week," I responded, feeling somewhat guilty all of a sudden. Maybe I should spend more time with Brian.

"I'll tell you what, stay over tonight. I'd like to hook Brian up to some machines so I can gather some data during his sleep."

"No thank you."

"Of course."

My husband and I responded simultaneously. We looked at each other, exchanging silent words. "I have work the day after tomorrow. Besides, this will probably cost extra."

I nodded, trying to signal that I understood. "This will be good for Brian. Maybe we can finally figure out what's wrong and what we need to do to help."

He sighed in sheer disappointment and clicked his tongue. "How about this: you drive home, and Brian and I will stay here for the night. I'll call my sister to pick us up tomorrow."

My husband considered this for a moment, sighed again, and nodded. "Alright. I'll see you tomorrow." He leaned in and kissed me on the cheek. "I love you."

"I love you too."

He walked away to speak with Brian, presumably to say goodbye.

Josh was looking at me intently. It was kind of unnerving. It felt like he wasn't looking at me, but what was inside of me.

I heard the door behind us close. My husband had left.

When I looked back, Josh was looking through his notes again. After a long moment, he finally looked back up at me and spoke. "When was the last time you and your husband had sex?"

My heart skipped a beat, and I flushed in embarrassment.

"Excuse me?" I was flabbergasted. What kind of doctor asks such questions? Was he a creep?

Josh looked me in the eyes. "I apologize. It wasn't my place to ask such a question."

I exhaled a breath I didn't know I had been holding. "It's okay." I'm not sure I wanted him to know that it's been a couple of years since the last time.

"How about we get Brian situated in the bedroom?"

I nodded. "Should I order some food for us?"

Josh shook his head. "No, it's alright. I will cook something soon. You guys were my last appointment for the day."

"Where will I be staying?" I took a quick glance at Brian. He was looking straight ahead, holding a piece of candy. It had already melted from the warmth of his hand. His face looked pale.

"In a guest room right next to the study bedroom."

I looked back at Josh, who was looking at Brian too now.

"Hey, Brian, what do you say about some pizza?"

Brian was completely zoned out. I walked up to him and put a hand on his shoulder. He flinched.

"Hey buddy, it's just mom."

He looked up at me, and his expression visibly relaxed. "We will be sleeping at the doctor's house, Brian."

"Why?" he questioned.

"Because I will monitor your sleep to figure out why you're having that bad dream," Josh chimed in. "I was just asking you if you'd like some pizza for dinner tonight?"

Brian smiled and nodded. "Pepperoni?"

Josh laughed for the first time. "We can do pepperoni."

The rest of the evening was uneventful. It turned out that Josh was an amazing chef. He made the pizza from scratch, and it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Brian seemed happy and content too. Brian played with some toys Josh had laying around.

Before long, it turned dark. Brian and I explored both of our rooms. Mine was small, but very well-furnished, with a single wooden bed in a corner. Brian's was big, with a bunch of machinery I couldn't even begin to describe. It also had a wide window facing the hallway. He'd be sleeping in a king-sized bed; the one he had at home was a single. Brian seemed excited. The last time I saw him this happy was during his eighth birthday.

"Are you ready, Brian?" Josh walked inside the spacious room, turning on one of the machines nearby.

"Yes," Brian responded enthusiastically. I laughed under my breath. This was nice.

Josh instructed Brian to get into bed. He was already in his pajamas. Then he hooked him up to some machines and made sure he was comfortable. "Are you okay with sleeping on your back?" Brian seemed nervous. "Don't worry, Brian. Nothing will happen to you here." After a pause, Brian nodded. "Good." Josh said.

After doing the last checks, Josh gave him half of a sleeping pill. He suspected Brian would have a difficult time falling asleep in a foreign bed with a bunch of machines hooked up to him. I didn’t object.

I walked up to Brian and leaned down to kiss his forehead. "Goodnight, Brian," I whispered.

He yawned. "Good night, Mommy."

I smiled. "Goodnight, buddy," Josh said from the doorway.

We both walked out and closed the door behind us.

"About earlier..." Josh began speaking.

"I asked that question for a good reason, not because I'm a creep."

"What reason?" I urged him to continue.

"I don't want to say until I am absolutely certain of something."

That answer annoyed me. Why bring it up if you’re not going to tell me? I didn’t let my annoyance show. "Okay." I yawned. "I am going to head to bed. If something happens, wake me up."

"Goodnight, June."

"Goodnight, Josh."

I locked the door behind me just as a precaution and plopped down on the bed. It wasn’t long before sleep took me.

That night, I had a strange dream. I was floating in the corner of Brian’s room back at home. He was soundly asleep and tucked away below the sheets. Something felt off. I wasn’t sure what I was doing there.

Then I heard a creak in the hallway. "No," I whispered under my breath. I tried to move, but I couldn’t. I was frozen in that damn corner of his room.

My heart was beating out of my chest. I was staring at the closed door of his room. The handle moved. Someone was opening the door. I glanced at my son. Brian was awake. His eyes were open and full of dread. He was shaking in his bed.

I heard the door creak open and I looked back at it, waiting for someone to walk in.

And then I woke up.

The guest room was as dark as it had been before I fell asleep. I felt for my phone on the bedside table and then looked at the time. 4 AM.

For a moment, I wondered why I had woken up, and then I felt my stomach growling at me. I needed to use the bathroom.

I put some clothes on in case Josh was still up and about and unlocked the door. If I remembered correctly, the bathroom was down the hallway past the study room where Brian was sleeping and to the left.

My mind was deep in thought as my feet carried me in the direction of the bathroom until I saw something out of the corner of my eye. I turned my head to look through the window into Brian’s room. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, my blood ran cold. Josh was sitting on Brian’s bedside holding something in his hand and talking.

Adrenaline coursed through my veins and I rushed inside the room. "Jun—"

"You disgusting pig! What are you doing to my son!?"

"June, I can explain—"

I took Brian into my arms, ripping every cable off. "My husband was right, not only are you a scam artist, but also a creep."

"June!"

I didn’t stick around. I ran outside of the room and straight to the front door, unlocking the bolt and running outside. I ran and I ran until my feet got sore and the adrenaline wore off. During this entire time, Brian remained asleep.

I sat down at a nearby bus stop to catch my breath, holding Brian tightly.

"Under the blankets," Brian suddenly spoke.

"Brian? Are you awake?" He didn’t respond. I shook him a little. But he was still asleep. I chalked it up to him speaking in his sleep. Maybe he was finally having a different dream.

Luckily, I had grabbed my phone when I decided to go to the bathroom, so I took it out to call my sister.

The sun had begun to rise by the time she picked us up.

I was deeply disturbed by what happened.

"And he asked you when was the last time you had sex with Leandro?" My sister was finding this funny.

"Yes," I responded calmly.

"And what did you tell him?"

"I didn’t tell him anything."

She nodded. "And then you found him sitting in Brian’s room? On his bed?"

"Yeah. I saw him through the window."

"What a creep," Lilia added. "I hope he didn’t do anything to Brian."

And right on cue, Brian spoke again. "Please, no."

I turned my head to look at him in the back seat. He was still sleeping. My heart ached for him. Those nightmares were horrible.

"He still has those nightmares?" Lilia asked.

"That’s why Brian and I were at that doctor."

After another couple of minutes spent in silence, we finally arrived at her house. I carried Brian inside and laid him down on the couch. Lilia brought some blankets.

"You should go get some more rest," she told me. It was already light out. I shook my head. "I don’t think I can sleep after that."

"Fair point." Lilia walked back into the kitchen and spoke up so I could hear her, "Well, I am going back to bed."

"Sure."

I contemplated calling Leandro. But it was still early, and I knew he’d just say "I told you so." I didn’t need to hear that right now.

My phone buzzed. I had a new email titled "The Reason for Brian’s Nightmares."

"What is this?" I whispered under my breath.

The message was short. "This is Josh. I attached an audio recording to this email. It will answer all your questions."

I swallowed. Do I really want to open this right now? After thinking on it, I decided to bite the bullet and clicked on the recording.

At first, all I could hear was the rhythmic beeping of machines. Then there was a voice. "This is Dr. Joshua. This is the second recording of looking into Brian Moore’s nightmares. I will be conducting what I call a sleep interview."

"I am going to engage with the patient now."

The voice cut out and I could hear a door opening, presumably the door to the study bedroom.

This was stressing me out. I paused the recording and went into the kitchen to grab a glass of water. My hands were trembling. I gulped it down in one go and took a deep breath. Resuming the recording afterwards.

"Brian, this is Dr. Joshua. Can you understand me?" Josh spoke to him.

Seconds turned into minutes as I was waiting for the next sound, and eventually Brian responded.

"Yes."

"Good, Brian, good."

"I want you to tell me what you see."

It only took a minute for Brian to respond this time. "A man."

"Do you recognize this man?"

"Yes." My son responded after another minute.

"Can you tell me who it is?" Josh sounded calm. His voice was soothing.

"It’s Dad."

Dad? Why is he seeing Leandro? What is going on?

"What is your dad doing?"

"He is looking at me."

Looking at him? What?

"Where is your dad standing?"

Brian took longer this time, but eventually he still responded. "At the foot of my bed."

"Correlation with the entity in his nightmares also standing at the foot of his bed." Josh spoke in a different note, seemingly to take note of it.

My head was blank. I just listened. My foot was tapping in a nervous tick.

"What does he do next?" Josh’s voice sounded slightly different as he asked this question, more on edge.

"He takes off his clothes."

My heart sank. I began fearing the worst. Was Leandro...?

"And then?" Josh's voice was strained now.

"He gets on top of me."

I couldn’t listen to this anymore. I locked my phone and threw it aside.

Brian was sound asleep on the couch. How did I not notice? How could I let this go on for so long? I was so stupid, so naive. I sobbed into my arms. My husband is a monster.

Lilia’s husband woke up first, and he found me sobbing next to Brian, running my hand through his hair. He tried to comfort me, to no avail. Once Lilia was up too, I told them both to listen to the recording.

I made sure I couldn’t hear it.

After a couple of hours, I finally managed to calm down enough. Shortly after, Brian woke up too. Lilia made him pancakes.

We talked about what to do next, and ultimately decided to drive back down to Josh to talk about this. He was the expert, after all. It all made so much sense now. I could suddenly see all the signs I couldn’t see before.

We are going to drive down to see Josh in an hour. Hopefully, Brian’s nightmares stop now—both literal and imaginary.

I will make sure Leandro pays for doing this to our son.
