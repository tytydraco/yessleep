Whether it is my next-door neighbor's dogs, a service dog for the blind, stray dogs on the street, or any dogs in general will not stop barking at me. These little insidious creatures that cannot keep their mouth shut cause me so many headaches that I wish that people would just stop having them around their houses or anywhere in general. 

To further elaborate on that, it happened around a week ago when my mom brought me to a neighbor’s party everything was buttery smooth at first until they brought out their “Family member” who turned out to be their recently adopted 4 years-old Labrador and then all hell broke loose. Upon seeing me it started to freak the fuck out, it start barking, whinging, and almost running away so I decided to leave because the sound of a dog barking really hurt my ears after I walk away it stopped freaking out. The family explained to the other that maybe she wasn’t ready to meet with a stranger yet. Overall a shitty party, but the food was amazing so I can’t complain. 

Another one happened a few days after the party, I was trying to retrieve the football that my friend accidentally kicked into a bush nearby and that was when I spotted two stray dogs that blocked my path and a ball. Based on the secluded nature of the location, at first, I thought that maybe this would be a perfect opportunity to shed my disguise and exercise a little bit, but upon hearing my friend I decided against it so all I did was just stomp on the ground which scares them away. 

The final one that just happened yesterday was when I walked down the paveway unbeknownst to me there was a blind man at the bus stop. When I walked past him his service dog just went ballistic and ran around, while it is funny in a twisted way to see a blind man chasing down his dog it stopped being funny when the dog got run over by a pickup truck and its owner crying while holding its corpse.

This begs me questions; what did I do wrong or did I not do enough? I have practiced human interaction for at least a year, I thoroughly study their anatomy so I can accurately mimic their anatomy. I learned their language and their social clues and everything that at this point I might as well be a human, but I guess it is just not enough. I can easily talk to a human and even form a relationship with them, but dogs seem to detect me regardless. Some recommend bathing in human sweat because apparently, dogs can detect me. After all, I don’t have a human scent but that is just really disgusting, I won’t ruin my smooth and moist skin with someone else sweat. Imagine the other boys' faces when they find me rubbing myself with their clothes, gross. So any tips on how to make dogs shut the fuck up? or do have to live with it, if this is the only option then I am fine with it cause while they like to bark at me they never really attack me guess they know who is the apex around here.

Also, I am 5’5 btw (Not sure why but I see that a lot of guys would insert their height into a conversation that has nothing to do with it, guess I will just do it as well)
