It’s currently November 23rd, I lost track of time by the hour a while ago. 

I got home pretty late after work, and since rents due soon I decided I wouldn’t be shopping for any groceries, and would only eat what I could find. I recovered some raw pasta and a can of marinara sauce and decided I’d eat spaghetti, no meatballs. I poured some water into a pot and turned on the stove, sitting in my couch while waiting for the water to come to a boil. 

I tried opening my phone, and could only get to the lock screen, not the password area or the face-scan area, which was, already weird now that I think about it. I shrugged it off, turning on the TV.

Static.

Before I could think of why any of this was happening, I heard a strange noise coming from outside my door, a sort of scratch and scurry. I walked over to the door, opening it, asking “can I help you?” As a reflex. What I saw completely ripped apart my understanding of…anything really.

How would I explain this in a way anyone would understand? I saw the entrance to my apartment, from inside my apartment. It looped back inward. I completely froze, staggering back, and falling to the floor, speechless and twitching.

After maybe half an hour of contemplation, I mustered up the courage to walk through the loop. Then walked to the other side, then back again. Testing the waters of this area. I walked up to my balcony, trying to open it. Locked. I tried break it open with a stool, nothing. Time was passing regularly outside, but no one can see what’s happening through the balcony because I set up a curtain on the outside for creeps. I only saw the outside through glimpses of blasts of wind on the curtain.

I thought about a few things, like rationing my food. I shouted for help for a bit, no avail. This entire situation made me feel sick. I walked up to my bathroom door so I could barf into the toilet, opening the bathroom door, I just saw the inside of my apartment again…From the front. I checked the 2 other doors in the apartment, a closet and the door to my bedroom. Thankfully, I had access to my bedroom as the door hung open, I kept it propped open with a shoe. The closet lead to the same front entrance as well. 

I recovered my laptop from my bedroom, it barely works, some apps don’t open and I can’t call anyone, I don’t even know if the emails i’ve sent to my friend to try to come pick me up went through. On the small chance it does, i’m deciding to document my experience here, even if it doesn’t send through, it makes me feel less lonely.

Its been around an hour since my last entry, i’ve been experimenting with walking around the loops, and I have a theory. I don’t know why, but it feels like tiny things shift around the rooms when I loop, like things change, and i’m not walking around and around forever. Maybe i’m just in denial, I’ll have to text further.

Next entry here, the lights seemed to have shut off, gave me a heart attack when it happened. I’m scrambling around in the dark for a flashlight, using the monitor as a light source. It’s really hard to go to sleep for some reason, it feels like I’m being watched. 

It’s morning now, the lights are back on, it’s light outside. Um, some strange things happened, really strange. I finally found that flashlight, and I was chilling in one spot when I heard knocking on the front door, I was highly skeptical when I heard a voice. It was the voice of a friend of mine, but something didn’t seem right about it…It didn’t seem…Human enough. I heard it start shifting, circling around, I realized it was trying to enter through the bathroom door entrance, “But if the front door was closed, how would it do that?” I wondered, not taking any risks, I ran to the door, slamming it. The knocks grew to pounding as the voice pleaded for me to let it in, growing louder, angrier, till it it just stopped. I don’t know if it’s left and I’m too afraid to find out. I’ll be sending this out now.

I just want to leave.
