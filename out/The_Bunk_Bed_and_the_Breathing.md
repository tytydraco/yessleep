This started in 1999, back when I was six, in Raleigh, North Carolina.

My bedroom was small, just big enough for a bunk bed and a dresser. My sister Sarah slept on the bottom bunk, and I had the top. She could sleep through anything. I couldn’t. Every night, I’d lie awake, jumpy at every little creak or rustle in the house. It wasn’t just the usual kid fear of the dark, though. It was something else.

I don’t remember when I first noticed the breathing. It wasn’t constant. Just… some nights. Quiet at first, this wet, raspy sound, like someone breathing through a bad cold. I’d tell myself it was the wind, or maybe pipes in the wall, but the sound wasn’t steady enough for that. And it always seemed so close, like it was in the room with us.

At first, I thought it was Sarah. I’d call her name softly, trying not to wake her all the way up, but she’d just mumble and roll over. She didn’t hear it.

Some nights, it would start faint and stay faint, and I could almost convince myself it wasn’t real. Other nights, though, it got louder. And worse. There was this pressure that came with it, like the air was thicker in the room, and I’d feel the bunk bed vibrate faintly, in time with those slow, heavy breaths.

I didn’t tell my parents. What could I say? “There’s breathing in my room”? They’d laugh it off. I even tried to convince myself it was all in my head. But when it happened, I’d lie there, stiff as a board, my heart pounding so loud it drowned everything else out.

It wasn’t every night. Sometimes it’d be weeks, even months, before it came back. But when it did, it was always the same—me lying there, too scared to move, Sarah out cold, and that awful, choking sound filling the room.

I got older, and I stopped noticing it as much. Maybe I just learned how to sleep through it. Or maybe it really did stop. By the time I was 12, it was gone. We moved a few years later, and I never thought about it again.

Until I came home to visit my parents last year.

They’d turned my old room into a guest room, but the bunk bed was still there, shoved into a corner under a sheet. I was helping Dad clean out the attic when he mentioned they’d had a pest problem years ago. “That old bedroom of yours,” he said, “something kept getting into the walls. We never figured out how. It was loud, though. Breathing, scratching… weird stuff. We had to call an exterminator a couple times.”

I felt my stomach drop when he said it. “Breathing?” I asked, trying to sound casual.

“Yeah, sounded like a raccoon or something. Real raspy.” He shrugged, like it was no big deal.

I went back to my old room later, just to look around. The bed was gone, but when I checked the floor where it used to sit, there were these faint trails in the dust, like something had been dragged in and out of the space under the bed. They led toward the wall, where the baseboard was cracked and slightly pushed out, like something had squeezed through.

I stood there for a long time, staring at those marks, trying not to think about all those nights I’d spent lying awake, listening.

I don’t know what it was. A raccoon. A stray cat. Something else. I don’t want to know.

I don’t visit much anymore, though. Just thinking about that room makes my skin crawl.
