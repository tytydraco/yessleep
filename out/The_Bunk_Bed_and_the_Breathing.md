Growing up, my room was the smallest in the house, tucked away at the end of a narrow hallway on the second floor. It wasn't much bigger than a walk-in closet, really, and the only way to fit two kids in there was with a bunk bed. I had the top bunk, my older sister, Sarah, had the bottom.

Sarah was always a sound sleeper. Like, *dead to the world* kind of sleep. I, on the other hand, was perpetually on high alert. Every creak of the old house, every rustle of leaves outside the window, had me wide-eyed, listening.

One of the earliest memories I have from that room, and it's burned into my brain like a brand, is the breathing. Not normal breathing, mind you. This was heavy, raspy, like someone was struggling for air. And it wasn't coming from Sarah.

It would start subtly, a faint wheezing sound that I'd initially dismiss as the wind. But then it would grow, becoming more distinct, more labored. It felt like it was right there, in the room with us, just below me. Sometimes, I could swear I felt the bed frame vibrate slightly with each ragged inhale.

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe it was the pipes in the walls? Maybe it was just the house settling? But there was an undeniable organic quality to it. It sounded like a living thing, trapped and suffering.

Of course, I’d try to wake Sarah. I’d nudge her, whisper her name, even gently shake her. Nothing. She’d just mumble and roll over, completely oblivious to the monstrous breathing that filled our tiny room. I was utterly alone with it.

This happened sporadically for years, seemingly without any pattern. Some nights were silent, blessedly so. Others, the breathing would start as soon as the lights went out and wouldn't stop until just before dawn. I’d lie there, stiff with fear, staring into the darkness, trying to pinpoint the source of the sound. Was it under the bed? Inside the walls? Was it… *closer*?

As I got older, I started sleeping with a flashlight under my pillow. A few times, when the breathing was particularly intense, I’d flick it on, desperately scanning the room. Nothing. Just our clothes hanging in the cramped closet, the shadows stretching and distorting familiar shapes. But the breathing would still be there, mocking my futile search.

Eventually, we moved. I got my own room, a much larger one, thankfully. The breathing stopped. I started to forget about it, chalking it up to an overactive childhood imagination fueled by too many scary stories.

Until a few weeks ago.

I was visiting my parents. My old room had been converted into a guest room, but the bunk bed was still there, disassembled and leaning against one wall, covered in a dusty sheet. I was helping my dad carry some boxes up the stairs when I saw it.

Not the bunk bed itself, but something underneath it. Or rather, the *impression* of something underneath it. The dust on the floor beneath where the bottom bunk would have been was disturbed, almost like something had been dragged in and out repeatedly. There were faint, almost imperceptible trails leading towards the wall.

My dad noticed me staring. “Oh, yeah,” he said casually, “we had a bit of a pest problem in that room for a while. Nothing serious, just some… well, we never quite figured out *what* it was. Exterminator came, laid down some traps. Seemed to do the trick.”

He continued talking, something about needing to clean out the gutters, but I wasn’t listening. My eyes were fixed on the dusty floor, my heart pounding in my chest.

Pest problem. Traps.

Suddenly, the heavy, raspy breathing echoed in my memory with chilling clarity. It wasn't coming *from* the bed. It was coming *from under* it. From whatever had been living, or perhaps *hiding*, in that confined space beneath my sister's bunk, just inches below me for all those years.

And the trails leading to the wall… where did they go? Into the wall cavity? Did whatever it was just… *live* in the walls? Was it still there, somewhere in the house, unseen, unheard… waiting?

My parents have lived in that house for thirty years. I slept in that room for over a decade. And all that time, there might have been something else there, sharing the space, breathing in the dark, its presence a silent, terrifying secret just beneath the surface of our normal lives.

Now, every time I think about visiting them, I get this cold knot of dread in my stomach. I picture that dusty floor, those faint trails leading into the unknown. And I can't shake the feeling that whatever it was, whatever *breathed* under my sister’s bed, might still be there, just out of sight, waiting for the lights to go out. And I wonder if the traps really got it all. Or if some things… some things just find another way in.
