 

It was a beautiful day, so I thought I'd try my luck at the lake near my house, like I did most evenings. I love fishing, there is nothing more peaceful then standing at the edge of a lake waiting for a fish to strike when the sun is setting in front of me. The only sound is from the dragon flies, buzzing past as they dance on top of the still water, causing little ripples that break up the otherwise perfect mirror image of the rugged mountains in the background.  

That was the only place I could really feel peace, and my thoughts weren’t clouded by the negativity of the real world. At home things were not going so good for me; my wife barely talked to me, anytime I walked into the room, she rolled her eyes at me and shook her head. Whenever I tried to confront her, she just mumbled something like, "not this shit again" under her breath before walking away. I don't get how she could go from laughing at all my jokes, even the corny ones, to being disgusted by the very sight of me in such a short time.  

And don’t even get me started on my job, it was horrible I hated every second I spent there. I only took it because of my wife; she said I travelled too much in my last job and persuaded her dad to hire me so we could spend more time together. Which of course I agreed to. Bad idea as he despised me, and he made sure me and everyone else knew it by constantly humiliating me in front of all my co-workers every chance he got. 

For a moment when I opened the boot and saw the body, I thought it was my father-in-law trying to prank me. He was always trying to find horrible ways to fuck with me like that; one April fool’s day he thought it would be funny to ring me and tell me that my mom was dead. Straight away I broke down and cried, my dad died when I was young, so she was all I had. I only realized he was joking when I heard someone laughing in the background. It turns out he had me on speakerphone and everyone in the office heard me. 

I was so upset I didn't go back to work for 2 weeks after that, and when I did, I was expecting an apology. Instead, he docked me for the time I took off and threatened to fire me. I know I should have left, but my wife was really close to her parents and desperately wanted us to get on. And to be fair to her, she always stood up for me against him, back then. Unfortunately, he knew how to manipulate her and would act overly nice to me when she was around, so she never got the see what he was really like. 

But after a while she became worse than he was, always picking on the smallest things, like my cooking. Everything was either too salty, dry or burned, you wouldn't mind but she couldn’t cook to save her life, she gave me food poisoning four times. Needless to say, *I do the cooking now*. Besides I worked as a chef for a while when I was younger and never got any complaints. 

I really don't know what got into her, she was always so nice and considerate, always made sure that I knew she cared, by leaving little notes around the house for me to find. We used to be able to spend all our time together and never argue. Then one day for no obvious reason she changed, and since then every day has been torture.  

That day when I found the body was a particularly bad day, we both had the day off, so we were stuck with each other all day, which really pissed her off.  

She never stopped moaning for even a second about how board she was, yet anytime I suggested we do something like, going out to dinner or bowling, she lost her head with me. One time she threw her shoe at me just because I asked her if she wanted to go for a walk, apparently, that was calling her lazy somehow. 

I had to get out of the house before I lost the plot, so as soon as she went for a shower, I was gone. I was so relieved driving down that road to the lake, I really needed a break from all that pressure I was under. I couldn’t wait to throw out my line. 

Then I opened the boot and saw him for the first time, I didn’t believe it was real until I turned him over and saw his eyes. They looked so... empty. And I will never forget the expression on his face, he looked hurt, like he was betrayed by someone he cared about, his hand clinched tightly over his heart. Then I noticed there was something sticking out.  

I don’t know why I did this; I know never tamper with a dead body. But I really needed to find out what he was holding, I don’t know why, but I just knew it was important. At first, I tried to pry his hands apart by pulling them, but I couldn’t, it was like his fingers were welded shut.  

I still wouldn’t give up, so I used a tire iron and ended up breaking two of the guy's fingers. When I saw what was in there, I couldn’t believe my eyes; it was a photo of the murder victim and my wife getting real intimate.  

I was in shock; I didn’t even know she was cheating on me, but I suppose, it did explain a lot. 

As I stood there in a daze trying to figure out how to explain why I had the body of my wife’s lover in the boot to the cops. I noticed Dan, the guy who owned the land I was on, was walking over towards me. I should have just jumped in and drove off, but I thought he would have been suspicious of me and said something to my wife, we were friends and he often called to my house.  

I tried to get rid of him as fast as I could, but he was one of those guys who never shuts up, and he knew everything about everyone, so he was a bit of a gossip. He would literally be the last person that could keep a secret, the whole town would have known what happened before I even left his property. 

I was so nervous, he kept leaning on the boot, I was expecting him to open it at any moment and catch me. I tried leading him away from it by walking to the front and sitting in, but he just stayed there leaning on the boot babbling away.  

Then all of a sudden, I heard a thud coming from the boot and he jumped. When he asked me what it was, I said I had just caught a huge trout and it was still alive. Before he got a chance to say anything else, I drove off. The stupid thing is there was no trout in that lake, and he knew it. 

I didn’t know where else to go but home, which was another bad idea, I had forgotten about my wife. And she was pissed, the second I pulled up to the house she was out shouting at me for sneaking out on her. Ordering me to go to bed like I was a little kid, I wanted to throw it in her face about her affair, but I couldn’t without incriminating myself. So, I played along and acted like my usual naive self. 

I don’t know how I slept that night, but I did, in fact I had one of the best sleeps I had in years. When I woke up, I felt great, for about 30 seconds that is, then I remembered the body and nearly fell down the stairs trying to put on my pants.  

When I got to the driveway, I realized the car was gone and nearly shit myself. I knew it had to be my wife that took it, so I tried ringing her, but she didn’t answer, I was freaking out thinking she was gone to the cops.  

Luckily moments later she pulled up to the driveway, for a moment I was relieved. Then I saw her walking towards the boot and, I nearly died, I kid you not, my whole life flashed in front of my eyes. By the time she opened it, I was down on my knees crying, “I swear it wasn’t me you got to believe me honey.”  

She just looked at me with a mix of disgust and confusion, “Get up and stop fucking about. I need help with the shopping.” She muttered as she took a bag of shopping out and walked away. 

When I looked in and realized there was no one there, I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Before I got a chance to think my wife shouted, “re you deaf, get in here” from the doorway and frightened the shit out of me and I screamed before falling back on my ass. 

When I turned around and saw my wife, she was shaking her head in frustration. I thought she would know that something was wrong, usually I don’t scare that easy. But luckily for me, she never said a word about it.  

For the rest of that day, I was on edge waiting for the cops to come and arrest me, but they didn’t. I was so confused, someone had to have taken the body, it didn’t just walk away. I didn’t know what to do, so I waited to see what would happen. 

The first week was the longest week of my life, I thought I was going insane, I was convinced the neighbours were watching me anytime I went outside. For a finish I was too paranoid to leave the house. My wife wasn’t around much, so she didn’t notice my odd behavior, I guess she was preoccupied with her missing lover.  

I thought things were never going to be right again but as the weeks went on and I heard nothing from the police, I begin to believe I imagined it all, even my wife’s affair. And things started to get back to normal, well... better than normal, my wife started being nice to me again. She even apologized for treating me so bad, and I really believed her, she wasn’t drunk or sarcastic this time, she was crying when she said it. 

Of course, I forgave her, how could I not, I loved her, I couldn’t just walk away from her like that. Besides she needed me. 

Soon we ended up falling in love all over again, I couldn’t believe how much she changed, I even found her singing in the mornings sometimes, and believe me she is not a morning person, so that’s saying something. I felt so happy, nothing could bring me down, not even her dad, and believe me, he tried.  

The only problem was she became kind of clingy and wanted to know where I was at all times. She even checked my phone, I guess she had grown a little paranoid of me, I don’t know why, I would never give her any reason to not trust me, and I trusted her, that was until one morning I woke to a message alert on her phone.  

Instantly I knew that something was wrong by her expression, “Ahh… I ha have to go” she stuttered as she jumps out of bed with a nervous grin on her face and quickly got dressed, “I’m late, I was supposed to meet my dad today. I’ll see you tonight.” 

Before I got a chance to say anything she was gone, I didn’t really find it overly suspicious at the time, her dad was a real hard ass when it comes to punctuality. So, I went back to sleep. 

I don’t know how I slept that long but when I woke it was nearly 6pm and my wife still wasn’t home. When I checked my phone, I had a string off missed calls and messages all from someone called “friend.” 

The first came in at 1:15pm it read, “Why did you leave that night? I thought you wanted help with the body. You better not be backing out of our deal.” 

An hour after that I got another one, “You better answer me mother fucker, tonight is the night, I put in a lot of work to make this happen, DON’T LET ME DOWN.” 

At around 3pm I got a message, “You have an hour to make up your mind or I will make it up for you.”  

I had no idea who he was or what he was talking about but I was terrified. Every 15 minutes after that he sent me a timer counting down, then he stopped. I didn’t know what to do, I thought he was going to come for me, so I got my things and tried to get out of there just to be safe. But as I was getting into my car, I heard a beep coming from my phone, I half thought about not checking it, but I did. 

I was relieved when I saw it was my wife’s number, “Check the boot honey, I have a surprise for you xxxx” it said. I didn’t think anything of it she often left me gifts especially now that we were getting on. 

So, I went to the boot where I found a small box with a blue ribbon wrapped around it. I quickly grabbed it and sat back in before opening it; inside I found a finger in a pool of blood, instantly I knew it was my wife’s because it still had our wedding ring on it. 

Seconds later I got another message, this time it was from, “friend” with only an address on it. I panicked and tried to ring the number, but there was no answer.  

I was freaking out, for a moment I thought about going to the police, but what could I say, everything looked really bad on me, besides my wife would have been dead before they could do anything. I spent the next few hours lost in thought, trying to figure out what was happening. 

At around 10pm I got a message saying, “The front door is open, at the top of the stairs its first door on the right. Check the glovebox. Go now, or the next time I will send you her head.”  

I still wasn’t sure what to do, but I went to the address anyways. It was just some suburban house, but it seemed somewhat familiar even though I had never been there before, I don’t know why.  

It was only when I checked to glovebox and found the gun that it finally hit me, and I knew what I was supposed to do. For the next hour I sat there weighing up my options and trying to justify what I was going to do, but I couldn’t make a decision. That was until I got another message, this time it had a photo, it was of a severed hand, it said, “You have 10 minutes. So, tick tock mother fucker.” 

I don’t know what came over me, but I suddenly got a burst of adrenaline, I guess maybe it was from the fear of losing my wife. I grabbed the gun and made a run for the house, when I checked the door, it was opened just like they said, so I slowly made my way upstairs. When I got near the top, I heard moaning coming from the room, my heart was racing so bad I thought it was going to pop out my chest. 

It is now or never I thought, my hands shaking sweat pouring down my face. I took a deep breath before I burst through the door and started firing into the bed. I didn’t even know who I was firing at they were under the sheets, I just kept on firing until the gun was empty, and the screaming had stopped, then I ran for the stairs.  

But before I got to the bottom I stopped, I don’t know why but I had to know who was in there, so I went back. When I pulled back the sheets, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing; it was the guy that was in the boot and my wife, they were having sex like in the photo, and I killed them, I killed them both.  

I got out of there as fast as I could and went home, then packed my things and have been on the run ever since. But it’s not over, they sent me a new address, this time I know who lives there; it’s my father in-law, it said, “In for a penny.” I broke the phone and threw it away, but I know it’s not over. I can feel it.
