Trips to the supermarket are usually safe. My Saturday outing to mine began a year long ordeal that I’m still putting the pieces together for.

Peanut butter, bread, and deli meat. Those were the last few items on my shopping list.

Getting the meat and bread wasn’t hard. Well, that’s not exactly true, getting the bread was a bit difficult, as I didn’t know which type my girlfriend wanted. I decided to call her and find out.

I called her.

**Me:** Hey, I’m at the bread, uh, “area”? I guess? Anyways, which type do you want? There’s a lot of them?

My girlfriend, Mari, responded.

**Mari:** Sourdough, is that all?

**Me:** Yup, thanks.

I hung up the phone and grabbed the nicest looking loaf of sourdough bread I could find. It was my day off today and Mari was working, so I was stuck on grocery shopping duty.

I managed to remember that she wanted natural (NATURAL) peanut butter, so I went to that section of the store next.

Both relief and panic overtook me as I got to the section of the shelf in which the peanut butter lay.

There was only one jar left. I looked to my left and then my right. Finders keepers.

As I went to grab the jar, another hand clasped onto mine. I looked at my hand, and then at the person who had touched me.

**Me:** H—hey, I had my hand on this first. You can’t have it.

I didn’t want to be rude to the person who had grabbed my hand, but they did grab my hand, and it WAS the last jar of peanut butter.

They weren’t responding to me, so I spoke again.

**Me:** C—can you take your hand off the jar now? I’m starting to get uncomfortable. Please…

The person, who I’ll refer to as The Stranger, spoke for the first time.

**Stranger:** It’s not nice to take things. You should let me have this. I don’t have anything.

I was caught off guard by that. I was so focused on getting the jar that I never ended up actually getting a good look at them.

They were *tall*. I’d say about 6’4. Unkempt, but short hair, scraggly facial hair and dirty clothing. I feel a bit ashamed for this now, but I wondered at that moment if the man could even afford the jar of peanut butter he was fighting for.

**Me:** I’m sorry, I was going for it first. I’m sure they’re going to have a new shipment in soon.

At that, I wiggled out of his grip and grabbed the jar. I muttered a quick “sorry” before scampering away and running to checkout.

Leaving the store, I headed back to the car. Before I got in, I decided to shoot Mari a quick text.

**Me:** Got everything. Still out though, anything else you want or need?

**Mari:** Mm, nothing I can think of right now. If it comes to me, I can prolly just go and get it myself.

I was about to respond when I felt a small pang of pain in my head. It felt as though someone was staring at me. I looked up and found that the feeling wasn’t without reason.

The Stranger from the store was staring at me. I looked back at him.

Realizing I was still talking to someone, I quickly replied to Mari.

**Me:** Okay. Oh, I wanted to tell you something.

**Mari:** Yeah?

**Me:** There’s some dude staring at me in the parking lot. I’m not scared of him or anything like that, but it’s really weird. He’s just—he’s just standing there, staring at me.

**Mari:** What the hell? That’s super weird. Did you ask him why or?

**Me:** No, I’m just about to get in the car, maybe I ought to drive away and put some distance between us. It’s really weirding me out.

**Mari:** Okay, probably a good idea. Stay safe though, wouldn’t want my boyfriend in danger on his grocery run, ha ha!

**Me:** Okay, gonna drive now. Have a good rest of your shift.

I had the steering wheel in a white knuckled grip. It didn’t bother me. He was just some weird guy at the store. What store *doesn’t* have that? God dammit, I said I wasn’t scared.

I said I wasn’t scared, but I can’t help but feel a forbidding sense of anxiety creeping over me. I feel like this isn’t the last I’m going to see of that man.

I couldn’t make it home soon enough. Getting out of the car and grabbing the groceries, I got into the house at a quicker pace than groceries would justify.

In the half hour or so that it took me to put the groceries away, the feeling of unease still hadn’t left me. I shut the fridge door and nearly collapsed.

He was standing in our yard.

By now, my feeling of anxiety had been replaced by one of anger. I’m not proud of what came out next, but the man was trespassing. I opened up the kitchen window and yelled at him.

**Me:** WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING IN MY YARD?!

He didn’t respond. He just stared at me with piercing black eyes.

**Me:** I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.

Nothing.

**Me:** H—HELLO?!

He finally took action, only he did so in the form of starting a trek towards me. His steps were slow and deliberate, almost like he knew what he was doing. I couldn’t believe my eyes.

**Me:** G—GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. I’LL CALL THE POLICE!

He just stopped, looked into the sky, back down, and continued walking. It was like he didn’t even *hear* me. I rushed to lock the front and back doors so I wouldn’t miss him.

I got back to the kitchen in record time and a bang on the screen was there to greet me. It was him, and he had slapped his palm on the screen protector in the window frame.

I walked up to him cautiously and asked him one question.

**Me:** Why are you doing this?

And he said the only words I would ever hear him repeat.

**The Stranger**: I’m doing it because you aren’t a nice person. You aren’t nice.

I was awestruck; was this about the peanut butter? My thoughts became quickly became reality as I replied.

**Me:** I—is this about the peanut butter, man? I can just give you the fuckin’ jar if you want. No need to follow me back to my ho—

*SLAM*.

The unmistakable sound of the front door closing rang out in my ears. W—was Mari home? I had to see, so I called out.

**Me:** Mari? Is that you?

The reassuring sound of my girlfriend’s voice rang out through our home.

**Mari:** Yup, who else would it be?

**Me:** if you can believe it, the dude from the st—

As I looked back to point him out, I saw nothing but an empty back yard.

**Me:** The fuck?

Mari came up and stood next to me.

**Mari:** Hm? What were you gonna say?

I steeled myself and turned to her.

**Me:** Hey, I’ll make dinner tonight. We need to talk about something.

She was a bit confused but agreed.

That’s all that’s happened for now, I’m going to make dinner and talk to Mari about this—this guy, I guess. I’ll update you guys if anything else about him comes up.

I’m hoping it’s a one off, though. This shit is super fucking weird and I’m getting more and more nervous thinking about it.

I’ll let you know how it goes.
