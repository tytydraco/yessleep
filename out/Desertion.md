The day things were set into motion, the air was thick with the promise of change.  Not just a change in my life, but change in the world around me.  The United States was on the brink of a big political scandal.  Older brothers and first sons were off fighting a fight that didn’t belong to them.  There had always been radicals that hated the war, but now whispers of dissent were sneaking into the living rooms of suburbia.  Folks were starting to get wise to the idea that being shipped off to die in some bombed-out shithole in order to “do your duty to your country” wasn’t all good ol’ Uncle Sam made it out to be.  Duty, my ass.  What does any 19 year old know about duty to a country they’ve only ever seen 50 square miles of?  And there I was, in the summer of 1972, the hottest any of us had ever seen, feeling the sweat roll down the back of my neck into the stiff, starched collar of an olive green uniform.  The twill weave of the cotton sateen was meant to be breathable, but if I felt like a stuck pig sitting on that bench outside of the station in Small Town USA, I couldn’t imagine what the thick, stagnant-aired jungles of Hanoi had in store.

It was getting late and after double-checking the time on my ticket, I was starting to wonder if this train would ever show.  If it didn’t and I didn’t make it to the airfield in time, would I be considered a deserter? Did I even care if I was? 

Just as the thought of missing my train and the daydream of ripping my draft ticket into a thousand little pieces started to settle on the edges of my mind, I heard the distant whistle of an engine.  It snapped me back to the reality I was facing: boarding a train at this lonely platform and being whisked off to become another moving part in the endless, non-discriminatory war-machine.  It didn’t matter that I was just a kid.  It didn’t matter that I’d be killing kids.  The only thing the unforgiving beast cared about was that I was a warm body capable of destruction.

The train pulled up to the platform, a mechanical behemoth speckled with a patina of rust.  The sienna splatters made me think of the dried blood that would tinge my future.  As the smoke billowed from the stack, puffing out in thick ribbons like the impatient, shallow breath of a pot-bellied cigar smoker, I heaved my pack onto my shoulder and stepped aboard.  

The car was empty, which seemed unusual for a late afternoon ride into the city, but my head was too full to become too preoccupied with the notion.  I found a seat by a window and rested my forehead on the cool glass, hoping to temper the flush in my face and the racing thoughts in my mind.  I let myself drift in and out of a waking sleep, never quite falling into complete unconsciousness despite the hours-long journey I had before me.  It was only about 45 minutes into this non-sleep that I was jolted awake by the sudden grinding halt of the engine.  There was no way we had reached our final destination yet, and there weren’t supposed to be any scheduled stops along the way.  So why, when I looked out the window, did I see that we had pulled up to a small, red-bricked depot?

I let my thoughts wander as I questioned the scene before me and was only shaken back to reality when a young woman stepped aboard and glided down the aisle.  Boy, she was a beauty.  Hair like an oil slick with eyes to match and a stare that pierced right through your heart.  She was petite, but her legs looked a mile long in her teal pencil skirt and knife-sharp heels that sure didn’t fit the uniform of any office secretary I knew.  And there she was, in that empty train car, coming right at me.  She slid into the seat directly across the aisle from mine without so much as a glance and fluttered open the newspaper that she had tucked under the crook of her arm.

I couldn’t help but cast a sidelong glance at my riding companion.  It started as a quick cast of the eyes, a gesture of acknowledgement and admiration, but once I caught a glimpse of that newspaper, it turned into a full-on stare.  This was the summer of 1972, but the date on that front page boasted 00000000.  I figured it had to be some sort of misprint, an error at the printing press, until I caught a load of that headline.  *World War III Hits US Shores – Thousands Flee, Thousands More Massacred*.  What the hell kind of cockamamie stories was this paper peddling?  And how had this lady scored one, let alone fallen for it enough to read it so openly?  I’d be embarrassed as hell to be caught dead flashing a thing like that around in public.  Anyone who saw would think I’d gone completely Looney Tunes.

I knew she had caught me staring at her paper, because suddenly a creeping feeling of eyes boring down on me spider-crawled its way up the back of my neck.  I slowly lifted my eyes in embarrassment, ears burning red, and I finally caught her glance.  Immediately, something in my chest shifted.  It was like déjà vu’s two-ton cousin settling in for a pot roast dinner.  It walked right up to the walls of my heart and dug in.  I’ve met this woman before.  Maybe it was in another life, maybe in a dream, but I knew her and based on that twinkle glinting in her coal-black eyes, she knew me, too.

And then, just as quickly as she walked into my life, she walked right out.  We had once again rolled to an unscheduled stop and apparently, that is where she was meant to get off.  She stood up, folded that bizarre newspaper right back under her arm, and breezed right by without so much as a glance in my direction.  But as her willowy frame waltzed past my seat, she let something drop from the palm of her fist right into my lap.  

It was a small strip of paper, like the kind you crack open a fortune cookie to get to, and scrawled in a neat, patient hand, it read “This is your stop.”  I would have thought nothing of it had it not been for that overwhelming sense of knowing I got from looking into that woman’s eyes.  And it was that feeling that pulled me out of my seat, rucksack slung on my back, and into the waiting heat of whatever unknown we had just pulled up to.

In front of me was the most picturesque little town I had ever seen.  Little pastel two-roomer homes were situated on the perfect grid of manicured-lawn-lined streets; there was a general store with pharmacy, a town hall, and even a library situated dead-center in the square.  And a worn welcome sign pitched right there at the train station reading, “Welcome to Desertion!  Population: 1.”

I looked all around me for any sign of that damn woman and her funny little newspaper.  She was nowhere to be seen.  There may as well have been tumbleweeds blowing across the landscape for how, well…deserted everything seemed to be.

After letting my strange surroundings settle into my brain and coming to terms with the fact that my leggy traincar companion had disappeared into thin air, I set about looking for anyone who might have been capable of telling me just where the hell I had ended up.

I walked the perfect, lonely streets of the most perfect, lonely town I had ever come across.  Now, that’s not saying too much, considering I’d barely tottered off the back porch of my own home in my 19 short years on this earth, but I’d bet a crisp bill to anyone who passed me by that they couldn’t find a better lookin’ place.  The square was lined with shops – candy-pink boutiques, butter-yellow cafes, mint chip-green general stores.  It was like everything had been made with watercolors.  Even the clouds seemed to be hand-fluffed by God himself.  I had gotten on a train headed for war, and was instead dropped off in a slice of heaven.

As I wandered the idyllic lanes, I tried to ignore the eerie quiet pressing on my eardrums.  I’d been walking for over 20 minutes, crossing streets, turning corners, and didn’t come across a single Sally or Jim.  At this point, the sun was starting to set, my pack was getting heavy, and I knew I’d have to call my exploration quits sooner or later.  So, I left the “bustling” town center and headed to what appeared to be the residential area of town.

It was here that I found a door waiting open, seemingly for me and me alone.  I mean, who else would it be for?  I was the only fella in, who knew, maybe a hundred, maybe a thousand miles.  For all I knew, I was the only guy left on Earth.  So, when I walked down Rustling Birch Road, passing by cookie-cutter homes painted by the same watercolor artist as downtown, and noticed a home with a gap open wide in its facade, like a missing front tooth in an otherwise perfect grin, I walked right up to the front porch and crossed over the threshold.  Something in my gut told me this was the place I was meant to lay my head for the night. 

So I did.  The next day followed just like my first.  I filled my time ambling the streets, scanning windows and storefronts for any sign of life, like a kid playing kick-the-can looks for anything to disrupt his boredom.  When the sun went down, I returned to my little house and went about my business like I would any other evening in any other place.  

Days passed, and my little house started to feel like it was becoming my little *home*.  And still, no sign of anyone or anything.  I let myself be as happy as I could be, given the circumstances, but when it came down to brass tax, I hadn’t really thought too much about the long-term, or the logistics of how I had even gotten here in the first place.  I was just some kid waiting for a train to carry me off to my doom when some crazy lady with some crazy paper led me on a wild goose chase where it seemed I was the only player.  

And that’s when it clicked.  I was alone and I had done it to myself.  My thoughts of desertion had come to fruition.  Something out there had unfurled those innermost thoughts from the well-hidden corners of my brain and created this perfect little oasis before me.  A place where I would never have to fight anyone else’s war, a place where that horrible headline would never become *my* reality.  A place where I was the only variable.

It’s been years, decades I’m sure.  Time works a little bit different here, so I’m not quite sure exactly how long I’ve been a resident of Desertion.  At first, I tried wandering in all different directions just to see if it would lead anywhere, but no matter how far I’d walk, every town on every horizon was always Desertion.  I tried waiting at the depot for the train, but gave up on that after days with no reward.  I even tried killing myself every way I could think of, using what limited supplies I had, but Desertion always finds a way of bringing me right back to where I belong.  Shoot myself in the head?  I’ll wake up in bed the next morning with a throbbing in my skull that only the finest aspirin in the Desertion Pharmacy can cure.  Hang myself?  That’s a recipe for a day full of hot tea and honey to soothe my sore throat.  

Desertion keeps the cabinets of my small home full of dry goods and the fridge stocked with produce.  The books on the shelves of the local library are always exactly what I’m looking for.  I’m well taken care of as far as amenities go.   I don’t know how any of it is possible.  I don’t know who that woman was.  I don’t know what powers that be created my little town of one.  But the one thing I do know as I sit here creating this record of how I got here is this: be careful where you let your daydreams wander, because when the train rolls into the station, it might take you exactly where you want to go.  And it isn’t coming back.
