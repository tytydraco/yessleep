The waves crashed against the jagged rocks, spraying salty mist into the air as I stood on the cliff’s edge. The wind tugged at my hair and for a moment, I felt like a part of the sea itself, with the waves below threatening to pull me back home. Granny always said our family had selkie blood. I used to laugh it off, thinking it was just one of her tales to keep the magic alive in our dull little village. But lately, the stories felt heavier, less like folklore and more like truth.

“The sea doesn’t forget, Aoife,” she had whispered to me once. “And neither do the selkies.”

A week ago, after Granny’s peaceful passing, I’d found an old chest buried in her attic. It was covered in dust and cobwebs, hidden beneath stacks of forgotten heirlooms. It’d been years since anyone had visited this dilapidated attic, and everything inside looked eaten away, as if time itself had started consuming it. Inside the old chest was a tattered cloak, thick and heavy, with a faint scent of brine clinging to it. It looked ordinary, holes at the edges, the color faded to a dull gray, but something about it unsettled me. Granny’s words echoed in my mind: “A selkie’s skin is the key to their freedom.”

*Could this be it?* Could this be the stolen skin that chained a selkie to our family’s fate? My rational mind whispered no, but my heart, the part that remembered my brother’s lifeless body washed ashore, insisted otherwise.

Granny’s stories had always been the same: centuries ago, one of our ancestors found a selkie basking on the shore, her seal skin draped across the rocks. Unable to resist her beauty, he stole her skin and hid it, forcing her to live as a human. She bore him children, but her gaze was always on the sea, her sorrow so deep it seeped into her descendants. They said she eventually lost her mind; eventually tossing herself into the dark, gray waves, and the sea cursed us for her suffering.

Now, standing on the cliffs overlooking the restless Atlantic, I clutched the cloak tightly. If the stories were true, my family’s betrayal had cursed us. Unlucky at sea, unlucky in love. Every generation, someone drowned, and someone’s heart broke. The curse, Granny said, would only end if we returned what was stolen.

I thought of him, Donal, the fisherman who’d stolen my heart. I saw his smile, warm and bright, yet tinged with sadness when I refused to promise him forever. How could I, knowing the weight of this curse? I couldn’t risk losing him to the sea’s hunger. But maybe… maybe I could free us.

I hesitated. What if it wasn’t true? What if this was just an old cloak, and I’d look like a fool tossing it into the sea? My fingers trembled against the rough fabric. The air around me seemed to hum, the pull of the tide growing louder in my ears.

Taking a deep breath, I stepped closer to the edge. “If you’re out there,” I called, my voice trembling, “I’m sorry. For all of it. Please, take it back.”

The wind seemed to quiet, as if listening. Slowly, I let the cloak slip from my fingers. It fluttered like a bird before the waves swallowed it whole. For a moment, there was silence. Then, from the depths, a seal’s head broke the surface. Its dark eyes met mine, and I swore I saw understanding, maybe even forgiveness, in their depths.

The seal disappeared beneath the waves, and the ocean’s roar returned. The pull in my chest, the ache I hadn’t noticed until now, began to ease. The sea no longer whispered to me, no longer tugged at my soul. I stood there, feeling lighter than I had in years, as if the curse had finally let me go.
