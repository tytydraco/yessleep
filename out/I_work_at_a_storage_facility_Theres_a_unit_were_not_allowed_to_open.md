I’ve worked at Horizon Self Storage for five years. It’s a boring job. People rent units, people forget they rent units, and sometimes people die without anyone knowing they rented a unit. Then it’s my job to clean out their dusty old furniture and boxes of forgotten junk before auctioning it all off to the highest bidder.

Except for Unit 147.

It’s been here longer than I have. Longer than the manager. Maybe longer than the building itself. No one rents it. No one cleans it. We are just told, in very specific terms, that Unit 147 does not exist.

I didn’t think much of it until last night.

I was on the night shift when I heard it. A knock.

Not from the office door. Not from the front gate. From inside the facility.

I did a walk-through with my flashlight. Silence.

Then, another knock. Three slow, heavy thuds. It was coming from Unit 147.

Now, here’s the thing. We don’t have a key for Unit 147. The lock is different. It’s an old, rusted padlock that none of our master keys fit. I radioed my manager. She answered instantly, like she’d been waiting for a call.

“You didn’t hear anything.”

I started to argue, but she cut me off.

“Do NOT touch that unit. Do NOT talk about it. Finish your shift and go home.”

I listened. I went home. I tried to sleep.

At 3:47 AM, my phone buzzed. An unknown number.

The text said “PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR.”

I didn’t respond.

This morning, I came in early and checked the rental logs. Unit 147 isn’t in the system. In fact, there is no Unit 147. Our records skip from 146 straight to 148. I pulled up an old facility blueprint, one that showed every unit in the building when it was first constructed.

Unit 147 wasn’t on the blueprints, either.

I walked the hallway, running my hand along the walls. I counted the doors.

There were more doors than there should have been.

Despite the chilling warnings, a nagging sense of dread and irresistible curiosity tugged at me. I wondered what secret lay hidden behind that mysterious door, what force or memory might be confined within its shadowed space. Every step I took towards it felt both inevitable and forbidden, as if destiny itself had led me to this moment of confrontation with the unknown. My heart pounded; silence answered my questions.

I don’t know why I did it. Maybe curiosity. Maybe stupidity. But today, after my shift, I brought a set of bolt cutters.

I stood outside Unit 147 for a long time.

And then, just as I gripped the handles…

The padlock unlocked by itself.

It didn’t snap or break. It just… opened.

I haven’t pulled the door up yet. It’s still closed, still in front of me, as I type this.

But I can hear something inside. Breathing.

And now my phone is buzzing again.

Another text from an unknown number.

“THANK YOU.”
