After I heard my own voice come out of the water, I stopped going near the edge.

I didn’t even sit facing the alley anymore. I kept my back to the wall and my eyes on the rooftop door like it was the mouth of something I couldn’t see.

That night, I didn’t sleep at all.

Every time I blinked too long, I felt like I was going to open my eyes and find wet footprints leading across the concrete. Or see the doorknob turning again. Or hear my mother’s humming right behind my ear.

But nothing happened.

Not right away.

That was the worst part.

The flood had taught me something: it didn’t rush. It waited.

Morning came, gray and sick. The air smelled like rust and rotting wood. I forced myself to move because staying still felt like dying slowly. My knees were scraped from the night before, and my palms were raw from gripping the pipe.

I checked the rooftop.

The satellite dish still sat over my mother like a broken lid.

My father’s body was still there, stiff now, his face turned slightly toward the sky like he was trying to listen to something far away. I didn’t have the strength to move him. Every time I looked at him too long, my chest tightened, and my stomach twisted.

I hated myself for that.

Not the grief.

The hunger behind it.

I tried to focus on survival. That was all I had left.

I checked the water bottles. Empty.

The rain had stopped.

No food.

No rescue.

Just a city full of drowning rooftops and things walking on them.

I sat in the corner near the broken tank, pipe resting across my knees, and listened.

Distant voices floated across the air sometimes. Quick arguments. Screams. Then silence again. A splash from somewhere far away. Metal scraping. A building groaning like an animal dying in slow motion.

Then something moved on the roof across the alley.

I saw it from the corner of my eye.

A shape.

Standing where the figure had waved yesterday.

My body froze.

It didn’t wave this time.

It just stood there, head tilted slightly, like it was watching me the way people watch a stray dog they’re deciding whether to feed or kick.

I didn’t move.

I didn’t breathe properly.

I waited for it to do something human.

It didn’t.

It stayed too still. Even the wind didn’t seem to touch it.

Then, slowly, it raised one hand.

Not a wave.

It pointed.

Directly at me.

My throat went dry.

I gripped the pipe tighter, my fingers aching.

The shape lowered its arm and stepped back.

And disappeared.

No footsteps. No jump. No movement.

It was just… gone.

I sat there shaking, telling myself it was a person playing games. A survivor trying to scare me. Someone bored. Someone cruel.

Anything normal.

Anything that didn’t mean the flood was learning how to hunt.

A few hours passed.

The sun never really showed, but the light changed slightly, like the sky was turning a page.

That’s when the rooftop door creaked.

Not the handle turning.

Not a knock.

Just the door… breathing.

A long, slow creak, like pressure shifting inside the stairwell.

I stood up so fast my legs almost gave out.

I backed away from the door, pipe raised, ready to swing.

The door didn’t open.

But something pressed against it from the other side.

Not hard. Not like an attack.

Just a gentle weight.

Like someone leaning their forehead against the wood.

Then I heard it.

A wet sound.

Like breathing through a throat full of water.

And then a whisper:

“Arav…”

My spine went cold.

The voice wasn’t a man’s this time.

It was my mother’s.

Perfect.

Not a memory. Not a dream.

Her exact tone, the same way she used to say my name when she wanted me to come inside before it got dark.

My eyes stung instantly. My throat tightened.

For half a second, my body moved on its own. A stupid, desperate step toward the door.

Because even after everything… part of me still wanted to believe.

Then the smell hit through the cracks.

Rot.

Salt.

Something old and wrong.

I stopped.

My hands shook so badly the pipe rattled against my teeth when I brought it closer.

The voice on the other side stayed soft.

“Open the door, beta… it’s cold out here.”

I covered my mouth with my free hand so I wouldn’t make a sound.

My mother never called me beta like that when she was calm.

She only said it when she was afraid.

When she was trying not to sound afraid.

The voice repeated, slower now, like it was learning:

“Open. The. Door.”

The pressure against the wood shifted.

The doorknob turned slightly.

Just enough to click.

Then it stopped.

Silence.

Seconds passed.

Then the voice sighed again, wet, heavy, pleased.

And it said something my mother would never say.

“I’m still warm.”

I stumbled back, hard, my shoulder hitting the wall. My stomach flipped, and bile crawled up my throat.

The voice started laughing.

Not loud.

Not even fully human.

Just a soft, broken sound, like water bubbling in a drain.

Then the footsteps began going up the stairwell again.

Not down.

Up.

Closer.

But the door never opened.

It just creaked… and creaked… like something was moving right behind it, rubbing against the wood.

I wanted to run.

There was nowhere to run.

I raised the pipe and screamed, finally, because my body couldn’t hold it in anymore.

“GO AWAY!”

The moment the words left my mouth, everything stopped.

The creaking stopped.

The breathing stopped.

The pressure vanished.

Silence hit so fast my ears rang.

I stood there shaking, listening for any sign it was still there.

Nothing.

No footsteps.

No whispering.

Not even dripping.

Just empty air and the smell of the flood.

I didn’t trust it.

I didn’t trust the quiet.

Because quiet wasn’t safe anymore.

Quiet was what came right before something terrible happened.

That night, I moved as far away from the rooftop door as I could. I sat under the broken tank with the pipe in my lap and my eyes open until they burned.

At some point, I looked across the alley again.

The rooftop opposite mine was empty.

But the floodwater below it wasn’t.

A face floated just under the surface, eyes wide, smiling.

It wasn’t my mother.

It wasn’t my father.

It was me.

And it mouthed the words, slow and clear:

“You answered.”

The face sank beneath the water.

And the city felt like it smiled back.

**If you want the rest, I’ll post it. But after this point… it only gets worse.**
