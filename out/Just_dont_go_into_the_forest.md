My mother used to say this. "Adam Pines, don't you dare go to the forest!"—these words echo in my head as I ride the bus back to my village, leaning my head against the window to feel the vibrations during the ride. It always seemed unnatural to me; a part of my family I'd never met lived in the forest, so I wondered why. Relatives from faraway places would visit other families in the village, often bringing treats like oranges or delicious chocolates that my peers later showed off at school. And there were only four of us Pines—me, my brother Ziggy, my mother and father. Our relatives lived so close because the forest was right outside the village, but those Pines didn't visit us, and my mother forbade me and Ziggy from going to see them.

From my current perspective, a person must grapple not only with the present but also with things from the past – hereditary mental illnesses, hereditary addiction tendencies, unresolved childhood traumas, and self-developed quirks. My mother used to call it more succinctly – cursed blood. As a kid, I used to think that if we, the Pines from the countryside, had it, then maybe the Pines foresters had more of it, and that's why my mother forbade us from seeing them?

As a teenager, I was able to glean bits of information about them from my father, who, though normally taciturn, would chatter away when he'd had a few drinks. And so, our relatives there included three brothers, Bernard, Stanley, and Dennis. The former liked to shoot with the communist secret police after the war, a great hero. Dad mentioned that once, enemies surrounded him in his hideout. He ended the story there, as it was time for bed. At night, I dreamed of Bernard fighting his way through hordes of enemies, like Rambo in "First Blood," which was playing in theaters at the time. I saw it in a neighboring town. My friends and I lied to the ticket agent about our ages to get into the screening.

This process of extracting these and other things from my dad with vodka or beer became a ritual of mine, because he was usually so reticent and sad. He and my mom didn't seem to get along very well. At first, reluctantly, then increasingly often, he'd share a drink with me, and immediately things would feel lighter, happier, and we'd chat. Some of that attitude stuck with me; I'm drowning my sorrows now, too. The problem is, if you try to drown such sorrows enough times, they become  deep-sea divers, and you can't do anything to them anymore. They're a master of survival, not like those people who have lumberjack burgers stuffed in jars buried in their garden, ready to survive World War III. Yes, survive. If World War III were to break out, they'd only do two things: 1. Sh\*t themselves, 2. Evaporate.

Stanley dreamed of becoming a priest from childhood. He went to the city to study, returned, and became vicar at a village near us. He carried a terrible burden, however, because back in the city, at the seminary, they confused him, and he concluded that God didn't exist. He never returned the same, not as calm and joyful. He abandoned his ministry. That's where my knowledge of this story ends, because that's where Dad ended both the story and his last beer. I hope Stanley somehow regained his faith.

Self-confidence is also a difficult thing. I was one of those promising youngsters, talented but lazy. After elementary school, I commuted to the school in the next town on a  bus like this one, then to high school, my dream university in the big city, and I left without looking back.

The third brother, Dennis, was a communist. But apparently, just as his brother Stanley stopped believing in God, Dennis never believed in this Marx, only seeking his own personal gain. And he found it: he took over the local sawmill, which made him a prominent figure in the area. Apparently, to amass his fortune, he denounced the previous owners as a hostile element. The previous owner's heart couldn't stand prison, and Dennis eventually began claiming that his ghost haunted him. Was an exorcist called, or the Ghostbusters? I don't know. Dad finished the bottle and went to bed.

The bus hit a pothole, and my backpack fell off the shelf onto the floor. Luckily, there was nothing there that could break. I reached down and picked it up, placed it on my lap, and lightly clutched it to my chest.

Dennis had a daughter, Eleanor. Since childhood, she'd been dating a certain Tad. When they were teenagers, things became serious after one country party, in the barn, on the straw. Eleanor didn't want to go to the next party because she wasn't feeling well, but, driven by some instinct, she arrived there after a while and saw Tad groping another girl. When their eyes met, Eleanor ran out, followed by Tad. The forest was right next to the party, and she jumped into the lake to keep Tad from catching her. Although Tad was a fast runner, he was a poor swimmer, and he never caught up with her, not then, nor ever after.

I actually know Tad, a divorcee, a village slacker. Why did someone like that have the honor of meeting my relative when she still came to the village and I didn't? Girls are a difficult subject. My older brother, Ziggy, was more adventurous than me and had a motorcycle – a red Jawa. I don't know if he got Anna on that motorcycle, but at least he had a girlfriend, and I envied him. After a few months, she told him she preferred another; then he got on that Jawa and rode away. Mom told me he'd started a new life in America, but there's big water between us and America, so how did he manage to cross it on that motorcycle? Twelve-year-old me wondered.

I met my Sophie while studying in a big city. After graduation, I got a job, worked my ass off, and our first child was born, then our second. But how can you talk about your children like that, not by name, but as your first and second child? Apparently, I was a cold father and a weak husband. Apparently, I didn't have time for such reflections. I only saw that the children, not me, had become Sophie's priority, while I, working 10-12 hours a day, made sure they had food, clothes, a place to live, extracurricular activities, and some clothing and gadgets that I didn't even try to understand, but which I sponsored.

Four years after Ziggy left for America, Dad announced he was going to the forest for some firewood and mushrooms. This surprised me, because usually only Mom could go there. Although she married into the Pines family, she didn't share our cursed blood, so our forest relatives probably couldn't kidnap her if she encountered them. I waited for Dad to return so I could extract more information about my unknown uncles and cousins during another drunken party, but that never happened. Mom said he was stupid, ran away from home, and went to live with his cursed relatives.

The day Sophie said she was leaving, on my way home in the car, I stopped at a bar on impulse. My hastily concocted plan was simple: get drunk and walk to my now-empty apartment two blocks away. It turned out differently; I got in the car and was caught. In that moment, I ceased to exist in the city, just as I had ceased to exist in the countryside after my mother's funeral. I arrived for Mass, the cemetery, then got in the car and returned to the city, passing up the opportunity to finally go to the forest and meet my relatives, now that the one person who forbade me from seeing them was gone.

Exactly, getting into a car as a driver, which I can't do anymore. You see, after my supposedly good studies, I couldn't find a job in my field. A friend got me into courier work—hard work, but decent pay. And so it's been for the last 20 years. That's all I know how to do, and it's not like I can start working remotely now, or I'll turn from a practical courier into a theoretician. So I'm no longer in the city, nothing keeps me there anymore. 

My family home in the countryside is haunting with broken windows, crumbling plaster, and cracks in the roof tiles , So the only place left is where I have my family – the forest. It doesn't matter whether, like Bernard, I'd stick a gun in my mouth, surrounded by the enemy, or like Eleanor, I'd drown, holding my breath under water until my body forced me to fill my lungs, or like Ziggy, I'd drive a speeding Jawa into a metal rope that I'd previously strung between the trees, or, like the rest of the Pines, I'd choose the rope that rests in my backpack next to a candy bar and a plastic bottle of mineral water.

The forest is calling and I am coming.
