Hello, everyone. This is kind of a follow up to the post my friend Damien made a little while back, just to kinda help explain things a little better. If you haven’t read it or don’t know what I’m talking about, you can find it here: 

[If You Wake Up in the Disappeared Town of McDougal, Read This Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/E8xjPFOFZu)

I’m not really sure how to begin this, so I’ll just start by introducing myself. 

My name is Sam, and I’m about twenty-seven years old as of 2025 (assuming time still works here the same way), and just like everyone else who was in McDougal on the evening (day?) of April 28th, 2018, I am now stuck here, and it looks like we are all that’s left. At least, we’re all that’s left in whatever version of McDougal we’ve been… I don’t know, teleported to? If you’ve read my buddy Damien’s post, you’ll know why it’s kind of a weird subject. 

Damien tells me that a few of you were asking for more details, what happened, how this started, what we found, all that stuff. I’m not really sure how much I can definitively tell, I mean, even for us it’s mostly just speculation. But I have at least looked into it a lot more than Damien has, so hey, maybe I can help? There’s only been a few comments or questions, so I’ll try and fill in the blanks where I can. I guess the best place I can really start is a few months before McDougal vanished. 

I officially turned 20 years old on February 13th, that day my family decided to have a small get together at the local church for a celebration. Honestly, most of the details there don’t really matter, so I won’t focus on them too much. However, one of the birthday presents I got from my mom was an old journal that used to belong to one of my ancestors, someone who happened to be an old army vet that fought from the 1830s through the 1840s. I know that probably sounds like a weird gift, but I’ve always been fascinated by history, and especially by family history. So to me, this aging and yellowed book was practically the holy grail of birthday gifts. 

I spent maybe a week looking through the journal, learning all about a man named Timothy. For the most part, what I read was stuff that only people like me would really be interested in. I learned that Timothy was born to a small family of fur traders in 1802, that when he was seven, his father taught him how to skin a rabbit, at thirteen he had his first midnight tryst, and other tiny things like that. Just enough to remind me that the old names and faces I was reading about were more than just that, they were people just like you or I. 

Sorry, you’re not here to listen to me play show and tell, back to what brought me here. 

There was an entry in the journal that started around 1835. Timothy had deserted his post in an effort to avoid a local war, taking his wife Agatha and two children, Mildred and Thomas, north in an effort not to be discovered, along with three other soldiers and their families. I can speculate with a fair level of confidence what war I think they were trying to avoid, but that’s not really important right now. What is important is that almost from the moment they arrived in a then unnamed settlement, Timothy’s handwriting suddenly became scratchier. What once had been neat and sophisticated cursive now seemed panicked and less focused. I’m not sure if anyone here has tried to write anything when they’re scared or anxious, but it’s almost like you can see where their hands were shaking, or at least I could. 

The writings spoke of bizarre locals who did the same thing over and over, day after day. It spoke of how some of them would wring  clothes after dipping them in non existent baths of water, while others would walk up to an empty stall and ask for the price of a fur or some other good that wasn’t actually there. About a week after they arrived, one of his friend’s son went missing. This, according to Timothy, drove the soldiers into a frenzy, sending them rallying behind the agitated father, who was determined to find and bring his son back. All, that is, except for my ancestor, who believed it was better to cut and run. 

Before anyone actually did anything, however, the soldiers confronted the local preacher, apparently wanting an explanation to whatever was going on. The journal doesn’t expressly say what the preacher told them, but what is there was enough to really get me curious as to what was going on in the settlement. To quote from the journal: 

“The preacher has gone as mad as his flock. He speaks of madness and witches, of chants coming from the trees. He claims the people here are sick, that they know not of their own affliction. He speaks folly. I have seen what atrocities these ‘sick’ commit when one crosses their path. No sickness I have seen imbues its victim with such impossible strength, such unmitigated fury. I know not if this witch he speaks of is true, but I have seen enough to dissuade me from lingering here. 

The others wish to stay, to brave the woods in search of our comrade’s friend. They will march to their deaths, and I will not join them. 

I have instructed Agatha to pack our belongings and ready the children. We leave tonight. They may call me coward, and perhaps I am. But just as McDougal must do the best thing for his family, I must do the same for mine. 

God forgive me.” 

At the time, the name McDougal jumped out at me immediately. You see, Damien had moved to a town with that same name about three years prior, when I was seventeen and he was twenty. So when I read that name, I instantly began to wonder if the two had any connection. I mean, what were the odds? Could my friend really have gone to the same place that my ancestor had walked over one hundred fifty years ago? 

Rather than sit and ponder such a possibility, I took to the internet and searched up everything I could on the name McDougal. Initially, I didn’t come up with much of anything, save for some random online profiles and one or two landmarks bearing the same name. Unlikely as it was, I checked each and every one of these pages for any connections. After all, you can be amazed what you’ll find in the most random of places. Eventually though, that lead ran dry, but I didn’t let that stop me. 

My next thought was to use various key words in my searches, both exclusions and mandatory inclusions. This managed to get me exactly what I was looking for, leading to an odd webpage that appeared to be a historical archive of the town. Aside from the various links and paragraphs, the page was mostly blank, save for an old timey looking photo of a trio uniformed soldiers, complete with era appropriate rifles and mustaches. At least, I thought it was a photo at first. A closer look revealed it to be a drawing of the three men, albeit an incredibly realistic one. The caption underneath the drawing labeled them as Private Gulley, Corporal Mulligan, and Sergeant McDougal, whom the page claimed that the town was later named after. I was ecstatic. 

More than a little eager to indulge in this rabbit hole I’d found, I spent the next several hours going over everything the page had available to read, from the town’s humble origins as a getaway in 1801, down to the backgrounds of the three listed soldiers. My own ancestor was never mentioned by name, and possibly not even at all. The only indication I could find of his existence was a haphazard acknowledgment of an unknown fourth soldier who deserted. Admittedly, that kind of stung, and part of me began to feel defensive for my recently discovered family member. Realistically though, what would I have even been able to do? Complain in a non-existent comment section? Call some number the page didn’t even list? So, I took it on the cheek, and just tried to keep reading. 

The more I read, the more I began to notice there were both similarities and odd  deviations with what I’d read in Timothy’s journal. Just like in said journal, the web page claimed that the soldiers had arrived in the then unnamed settlement and noticed something distinctly off with its settlers, eventually culminating in the disappearance of McDougal’s son, and their decision to go after whatever was causing it. However, the page claimed that the soldiers had not been deserters from a war, but rather a sort of reconnaissance force, trying to explore more of the land. The page also never explicitly stated what was off about the settlers, only that they behaved strangely and unnaturally. 

More interesting to me, however, was that the web page never actually named what or who it was the soldiers went after, with the web page treating the story almost like an urban myth. Supposedly, what the soldiers actually fought in those woods had been “lost to time”, with the most prevalent theories being a particularly large black bear, a band of outlaws, and a pack of wolves. Whatever the case, McDougal would die in the fight, which is why the town wound up named after him. At no point, however, did the webpage ever mention witches or madness like Timothy’s journal did, even as a one off theory. 

Now, I don’t know much about witchcraft, as I never really had much desire or interest in diving into it, so I wasn’t sure if trying to cover it up was something common back in the day. If anything, it seemed like exposing it and punishing it was the standard, I mean, just look at the Salem Witch Trials or literally any investigation during the Middle Ages. I also don’t know if what was being described, that is, forcing someone to repeat the same thing over and over, was even something possible with witchcraft. But the more I thought about it, how few answers there were between the journal and the web page, the more I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. Maybe it was just because my friend was living there now, but I needed to know what had happened in McDougal. 

About a week before the town vanished, I managed to get a some time off from school, and from work. After a few calls back and forth with Damien, I managed to set up a hangout, during which I would stay with him for the week. I didn’t tell Damien about the journal, or that I was really heading up there to try and make sense of what I’d read. Even looking back on it now I realize how absurd it sounds with no context. Heck, if it weren’t for the whole place disappearing, it still probably would. 

I arrived in McDougal on the morning of April 22nd after a roughly two hour drive from home. The best way I can describe McDougal is that it looked rustic, and almost stereotypically outdoorsy. Most of the buildings looked they had been hand built with bricks, logs, and other more natural building materials. Any signs that marked important locations like a store, hospital, or police station looked hand painted, with no signs of a neon light anywhere, or anything electrical for that matter. The only indications that I was in a modern town at all were the small patchworks of telephone wires and street lamps throughout. Well, that and the cars everyone was driving. I’ll admit I took a liking to the place almost immediately, it was warm and inviting in a way most cities or towns aren’t, and honestly it just seemed peaceful. Kind of an ironic thought, considering. 

I won’t bore anyone with details of that first day, as nothing really happened. Since I hadn’t told Damien of my main reason for being here, I spent most of it unpacking, catching up, and convincing Damien to show me the local sights. It admittedly felt a little dishonest not telling him the whole truth, but I reasoned that since I actually had missed him and wanted to catch up, it wasn’t like I was lying. I was hanging out with him, making sure he was okay, and if I learned a bit more about the place he lived, that was a bonus. The day after I arrived, however, was Sunday. 

For reasons I won’t go into, Damien lost his faith around the same time he moved, and from what I understood, hadn’t been to church even once since he left home. Most days, I was sad for him, and silently prayed that one day he would rediscover his belief in God. That day, I selfishly hoped for the opposite, and was relieved when he informed me he wouldn’t be attending even after I offered to go with him. This would give me the chance to ask around a little bit, see what I could learn about McDougal from a local or two. So, after changing into a nice button up shirt and a pair of black dress pants, I bid Damien farewell for a time, and promised to meet up later at a local favorite of his, a diner and bar called the Whopping Catch. 

The church I went to, Hope and Sanctuary, was located in the center of town, and I arrived by 9:42 AM. The church was a small one, being only one long room with two rows of wooden pews leaving a small walkway, which was decorated with a blue carpet. A small stairway led up to an elevated stage, where a wooden podium decorated with a wooden cross stood proudly in center stage, along with two more elevated steps behind it, presumably for the choir. A set of two medium windows on the sides of the building allowed sunlight to pour in from the outside, and nine plain purple banners hung from the back of the church, each carrying golden lettering of a Fruit of the Spirit, with another thin golden outline depicting an image associated with said Fruit. For example, there was a wedding ring for faithfulness, a heart for love, an open hand for gentleness, you get the idea. It was a nice little place, and shared the same homey feeling that the rest of the town did. 

It saddened me then when I realized that there were only about two dozen people actually present. Maybe I was just used to church in my home city with maybe a hundred or so people, but this looked like too small of a gathering for such a little town. I wondered if maybe there were other churches in town that had more people? Maybe people were out hunting or something and just weren’t able to make it? Regardless, I did my best to introduce myself to the few churchgoers before service, who were all genuinely polite, and seemed to instantly notice I wasn’t from around. 

The service began about a minute after 10:00, and was led by a sharply dressed man that looked to be in his late 40’s, or maybe early 50’s. His face was mature and slightly wrinkled, with small but noticeable streaks of grey in his brown hair, mustache, and beard, and he wore what looked to be simple glasses that rested comfortably on his nose. Although the man didn’t formally introduce himself before or during the service, it was easy enough to identify him as the pastor. The sermon itself focused mostly on the apostle Paul, something that felt oddly personal for reasons that, again, I won’t go into. 

After service concluded, I lingered around the church for a while, introducing myself to a few members of the congregation. While I did genuinely want to socialize, my primary goal was to try speaking with the pastor, who was currently going through a small group of people who looked to be speaking with him. My reasoning was that as a pastor of a local church, he probably had at least some grasp of the local community, and knew who I could talk to so I could learn more about McDougal itself. If I was lucky, he might even be willing to introduce me to some of them.

After a few minutes, the pastor seemed to make it through the small crowd, and seeing my chance, I casually approached him with a smile. 

“Good morning Pastor, great sermon.” I said politely, extending my hand as he turned to face me. He wore a kind smile on his face, and he even seemed to light up a bit when he saw me. 

“Hello there young man, and thank you. Pardon me, but I don’t believe I’ve seen you around here before.” He replied in a deep but gentle voice as he took my hand and shook it. The question in his statement was polite, but clear, so I answered.

“No sir, I’m from out of town visiting a friend I haven’t seen in a while.” I quickly realized that I hadn’t actually introduced myself, so I quickly threw in my name. 

“I’m Sam, by the way.” The pastor nodded and folded his hands in front of him. 

“Well, we’re happy to have you this morning, Sam. I’m Pastor Mulligan.” My heart stopped for a second. Had I just heard that right? Mulligan? 

“Pastor Mulligan?” I asked in an admittedly confused tone. The pastor waved away the question, and almost seemed embarrassed. 

“I know, using the last name is a little formal, it’s just something we’ve done here since the church was founded.” He explained. 

“No, that’s fine, it’s just… wasn’t this town founded by a Corporal Mulligan?” I asked. I don’t know why, but part of me expected his demeanor to change, to suddenly become more serious or threatening. Instead, he remained just as polite as before, he even seemed to look somewhat impressed. 

“I see you’ve done some research, young man. Technically, the town itself existed before he arrived here, but yes, he was familiar with the man that it was later named after. And, since I’m sure you’ll ask, I am a distant relative of his.” He explained. I could hardly believe my luck, what were the odds I’d run into a descendant of one of the founders of town? Or, I don’t know, key figures? Whatever the correct term was, I was ecstatic. If he was immediately familiar with what I was talking about, maybe he knew more than I had hoped, maybe I could get my answers right here and now. 

Luck stayed on my side, as after I explained the second, and primary reason why I was here, the pastor was exceptionally gracious to me, offering to answer any questions he could. I’m not sure exactly how much of our conversation is relevant to current circumstances, but I’ll try to go through everything that sounded important. I started by asking what happened to the three soldiers and their families.

“Well, mine is the only one of the main three still around. The McDougal name effectively died with the sergeant, and frankly, I can’t recall what families his daughters married into. As for the Gulleys, they left town not long after fighting whatever was in the woods that day, no one has seen or heard from them since.” He explained. It wasn’t really what’d I’d meant with the question, but I was interested to learn it nonetheless. I considered informing him that I actually knew someone with the last name Gulley, but it didn’t really seem relevant, and I knew that would probably just get us further off topic.

“That’s cool that your family stuck around. Are they kinda like royalty here?” I asked in an attempt to course correct.

“No, not really, if anything we try to keep ourselves humble. After the preacher died, the good corporal stepped in to become the town pastor. Ever since then, we’ve been serving the community in one way or another. My grandfather and uncle were both the pastors here before me, my father was a cop, that sort of thing.” Even then, the thought occurred to me that pastors and cops are positions of authority, but maybe he was just referring to government stuff, I don’t know. 

“You don’t help run it at all?” I asked. Pastor Mulligan shook his head. 

“Nope.” He said before pausing a moment. After a second of contemplation, he raised a finger and amended his statement. 

“Well, technically that’s not true. I guess my grandmother used to organize things for tourists, if that counts. I remember she was really proud of herself for making a web page back in the day talking about the town.” Again, what were the odds? 

“That’s actually what lead me here, I think I found that page.” Pastor Mulligan chuckled to himself. 

“How about that? I’m sure she’d be thrilled to know she got one last person to visit.” I don’t know why, but something about the phrasing of that shook me the wrong way. 

“One last person?” I questioned. The pastor sighed and crossed his arms as he looked out towards one of the windows. 

“Yeah, the tourism thing kinda died a little over twenty years ago. Broke my poor grandma’s heart.” He admitted. I immediately felt bad for being shaken. 

“Oh, I’m so sorry, what happened?” 

“Well, word spread that there was weird stuff going on in the surrounding woods. People got spooked and just stopped coming. Eventually, we just shut down the whole tourism thing all together, and poor grandma just had to find something new.” I felt my chest tighten a bit as he explained. 

“What kind of weird stuff?” I asked, worried I wouldn’t like the answer. 

“All sorts of things, really. Chanting late at night, nightmares, doing things in their sleep, that kinda thing. Some people claimed to see these blue lights somewhere in the distance, but I’m pretty sure those were just meant to scare people more.” By this point I hadn’t even realized that the church was almost completely empty now, save for me and the pastor. My mind was spinning with every word he spoke, darting back to the descriptions given by my ancestor’s journal. 

Admittedly, the blue light thing was new, but I distinctly recalled the preacher in Timothy’s journal mentioning strange chants in the woods, and Timothy himself mentioned having nightmares. Was there any chance these two things were connected? If so, why was there more than a century between them? Suddenly this place didn’t feel so warm or inviting. 

“Didn’t something similar to that happen before?” I asked. Pastor Mulligan must have noticed me becoming frightened, because his expression shifted to one of concern as he raised a hand to calm me down. 

“Easy, son. It’s just some local folk-tales, don’t let it get to you.” He said reassuringly. 

“No, I mean weren’t those things that happened when the soldiers arrived here? They said the same thing, didn’t they?” The pastor’s expression changed again, this time to one of confusion. 

“What do you mean?” He asked. 

I explained everything, the journal that my mother had given me, what I’d read, my concerns, everything. The pastor, God bless him, never once interrupted me, just listened as I shared what I’d learned, and how it lined up all too similarly to what he was describing. When I asked if these “weird things” were still going on, the pastor even confirmed that a few locals would complain about it every so often. 

I asked what it was the soldiers fought that night, and when he admitted that he didn’t actually know, I gave my theory. 

“Witches? I seriously doubt that’s what going on. I wouldn’t put too much stake in urban legends, Sam. We’re okay here, really.” He tried reassuring me. I wanted to stay and ask more questions,  but by then it was almost noon, and I had to say goodbye in order to keep my planned meeting with Damien. So, it was with a slight hint of regret that I parted ways with Pastor Mulligan, wishing him a good day, and he the same to me. Even as I left, however, I couldn’t help but think about what he had told me. 

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every time I thought I might be able to doze off, I’d start  thinking about chanting in the woods, what my ancestor and those tourists must have heard all that time ago. I even thought I was hearing it myself at one point. What did it mean? Did I really think that my ancestor, or rather, the preacher’s idea of witches was really legit? If it wasn’t, why were locals still hearing chanting from the woods? Why were they seeing some blue light? That’s when an idea hit me. 

Stepping outside of Damien’s home, I watched the dark shadows in the trees, listened to the sounds of night as I stood outside, heart pounding. At first, I didn’t see or hear anything, just the rustling leaves shaking in the wind. I chastised myself for getting so worked up. 

“You’re being ridiculous. There’s nothing there.” I said to myself, hoping that I would somehow convince myself it was true. A thread of doubt lingered, however, and even as I shivered in the cool night, aching to go back inside, I stayed. I’m not sure how long I stayed out there, but it was long enough that my legs started aching. 

I was about to give up and walk back inside when I saw it. To the right of the house, barely visible between the cracks in the trees. Amidst a deep blue and grey sky, no stars in sight, was a haunting blue light. I’ve never seen the Northern Lights or anything like it, but it’s the only way I can think to describe it. A thin, wavering blue stream dancing in the sky. As it softly danced, I could hear what sounded like a soft humming, very so often broken by a strange language I couldn’t recognize. 

I kept thinking that this couldn’t be possible, that I had to be dreaming or something. I even pinched my arm hard enough to draw blood with my nails. The lights never went away, just gently waved in the sky. The chanting continued in a rhythmic, and darkly melodic tune, almost seeming to direct the light, if that makes sense? When it went higher, the light seemed to ascend, and when it was deeper, it seemed up recede deeper behind the trees. 

My phone, I realized. I needed to record this with my phone, show people whah was going on. I must have been gone for a minute or two at the most, but when I charged back outside with my phone in hand and camera ready, they were gone. The lights and chanting, both gone just as quickly as they’d arrived. I stood motionless for a long time, my heart pounding as I waited for them to return, but they never did. 

As I stood there, I wondered what I should do. I thought about leaving then and there. I wasn’t sure if it was a witch, my mind playing tricks on me, some practical joke, I didn’t know. All I knew was that I wanted to go home, curl up safe in my own bed, to hug my mom and my dad, warn people never to come here. I’m sure some of you might even wonder why I didn’t. Well, it was because of Damien. 

Damien, my friend, lived here. I couldn’t just leave him, right? I had to explain this to him, but how? He’d already renounced his faith, how was I going to convince him there was something like a witch in the woods, assuming that’s what it even was? I didn’t even know for sure, I still don’t. He’d need something concrete, I realized. I needed video evidence.

I tried staying up late to get evidence of the light or the chanting for the rest of my time there, blowing off any time Damien questioned why I seemed so tired all the time, why I was suddenly so shaky. In hindsight, maybe I should have told him, maybe he would have believed me? I don’t know. The light never showed back up, and even though I swore I heard chanting a few times, I never heard anything when I played back the videos on my phone. The day before I was set to leave, I still didn’t have anything to show him, and by then it was already too late. 

A local tried to leave that morning to visit a relative that lived in the next town over, came back screaming that everyone was gone. I tried calling my mom, my dad, anyone. But I couldn’t reach them. I knew immediately it was true. 

If it’s all the same, I really don’t wanna talk about my drive home, then back to McDougal. I still have nightmares about it. 

I’m sorry there’s nothing concrete here, I know how absurd the idea of witches and some weird spell sounds, but it’s all I’ve got. I know there’s more to tell, too, but this post is getting really long, so I have to cut it off here. If anyone’s interested, maybe I can convince Damien to document our next expedition outside of town, or to go with me deeper into the woods, see if we can find something more solid. 

Until then, to those of you just arriving, please be safe. If you need anyone to talk to, you can find me at Hope and Sanctuary  every Sunday, and probably at the Whopping Catch every weekday when I’m not out gathering supplies with Damien. 

I can also answer your questions here, if that’s more comfortable for you, really whatever works. Sorry, I’m rambling, just stay safe, please. 

And God bless you, we definitely need Him, in here.
