It all started last week when I found a hidden attic in my house. I’ve lived here for years, but I had no idea it existed. The entrance was hidden behind a panel in the closet of the spare bedroom. I was rearranging furniture when I accidentally knocked the panel loose. Curiosity got the better of me, and I climbed the narrow stairs to take a look.

The attic was mostly empty, just a few dusty boxes scattered around. In the corner, though, I found something strange: an old photo album. Its cover was cracked leather, and the pages were yellowed and fragile. It looked like it hadn’t been touched in decades.

Flipping through it, I felt unease creeping in. The photos were black-and-white portraits, but the subjects didn’t look right. Their faces were frozen in expressions of fear, their eyes wide and staring directly at the camera. Some figures had distorted features—blurry faces, limbs that seemed too long, or unnatural shadows behind them. It gave me chills, but I couldn’t stop looking.

Then I came across a picture of my house. It was unmistakably the same house, but the photo was dated 1903. In the image, a crowd of people stood outside, pointing at a second-story window. At first, I didn’t notice it, but in the window, there was a shadowy figure. Its face wasn’t clear, but I could make out glowing eyes. The longer I stared, the more I felt like it was staring back.

I slammed the album shut and left the attic, my heart racing. I wanted to forget about it, but I couldn’t. That night, things got worse. I heard faint noises—creaks in the floorboards, whispers I couldn’t quite understand. I told myself it was just my imagination, but the whispers grew louder. Then they said my name.

The next morning, I worked up the nerve to go back to the attic. I wanted to convince myself it was all in my head, that the photo album was just some creepy old artifact. But when I got there, the album was open, lying in the middle of the attic floor. It hadn’t been where I left it. My hands shook as I flipped to the photo of my house. The crowd was still there, but the figure in the window was gone.

Since then, things have escalated. The whispers haven’t stopped, and now they don’t just come at night. I hear them in broad daylight, faint but insistent, always just out of reach. Sometimes, I can almost make out words, but I don’t want to listen too closely. The floorboards creak as if someone is pacing right behind me, even when I’m completely alone. And the shadows—I can’t even explain the shadows. They move in ways they shouldn’t, darting across the walls when there’s nothing there to cast them.

I tried locking the attic, but it didn’t help. Yesterday, I found the photo album on my kitchen table. I never brought it downstairs. The photo of my house was still in it, but now, the shadowy figure was standing on the front porch. It’s getting closer.

I’ve thought about leaving, but I’m terrified. What if it follows me? What if leaving makes it worse? This house feels alive now, like it’s watching me, waiting for something. I can’t shake the feeling that whatever I saw in that album isn’t just confined to this place. It feels like it’s attached to me.

I’ve stopped sleeping. Every time I close my eyes, I see those glowing eyes in the window, staring into my soul. I don’t know what it wants, but I’m scared to find out. If anyone has any idea how to stop this, please, I’m begging you—help me. I just hope it isn’t already too late.
