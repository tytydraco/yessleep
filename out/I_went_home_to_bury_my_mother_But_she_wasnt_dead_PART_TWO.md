The cemetery headstones dated back to the 1800s. German names. Irish. Polish. People who came to mine Virginia metals. Mom would lie beside Dad. He'd been down there twenty years.

As we walked, George read the stones aloud.

Wilhelm Krueger 1847-1889  
Stanislaw Wychek 1855-1891  
Conrad Beckerman 1860 - 1900

Dozen more. Then the memorials. A grim history.

1889 – twelve souls, pit collapse.  
1901 – nineteen dead, suffocation.  
1923 – seven killed, explosion. Two of them were boys. Old enough to work.

Fathers. Brothers. Sons.

Coal. Lead. Zinc.

Things happen in the deep. Mining companies don't always tell the truth about what comes back up.

I'd walked past these memorials my whole life. Never thought much about them or the mountain looming over the town. That sustained life when times were good. Or bad. 

The grave was already dug. But there were other holes scattered throughout the cemetery. Fresh ones. A dozen at least. Without markers. Had they been recently dug or recently exhumed? I wasn't sure. But it gave me a bad feeling.

George noticed too. He was staring at the nearest one. 

As they lowered the casket, Reverend Lucas recited familiar words about dust returning to dust. But no one cried. Not even me. I tried, but couldn't. Not with all those eyes watching.

And when it was done, nobody left. They just stood there in circles around the grave. Even the children. Breathing in sync. In. Out. Perfectly timed.

I thought about Mom's letters. *The whole street.*

The earth had given them back.

Dolores stepped forward. She took my hands. Her grip was cold and dry.

"She's with us now."

I pulled back. "What does that mean?"

Dolores didn't blink. Just stared with that same blank expression. "Why did you lie to me, sweetheart?"

My chest tightened.

"You still bite your nails when you're nervous," Hadley said from somewhere in the crowd.

I spun around. Hadley was on the opposite side of the circle. Twenty feet away. But his voice had come from right beside my ear.

"The miscarriage." Now it was Dolores speaking, but her mouth didn't quite match the words. Like she was lip-syncing. "She wanted to come to you, but you wouldn't let her."

"Stop."

"You said you were fine." Mrs. Henderson this time. Or maybe still Dolores. The voice was the same. "But a mother knows when her baby is hurting."

Mrs. Henderson stepped closer. They all did. Not shuffling. Not walking. Moving as one, like a wave closing in.

"She understood," a little boy called out.

"But it hurt her," an old man finished. Same sentence, two mouths. Seamless.

"Every holiday alone," three voices said in unison. Different pitches, same words, same timing.

"A birthday forgotten," the whole crowd whispered together.

I was shaking. The guilt I'd buried was on every face. Things I'd never told anyone. Things Mom couldn't have known. But somehow they all did. Every single one of them.

"And you," Dolores turned to George. Her head swiveled too far, neck bending at an angle that should have hurt. Around the circle, every head turned the exact same way, the exact same degree. "She fucking despised you."

Four hundred and seven faces looking at George. Four hundred and seven pairs of eyes, all reflecting the same thought.

"You took her baby away," Hadley said.

"Made her choose," Mrs. Henderson added, but I could see Hadley's lips moving with the words.

"She was never the same," Dolores continued. As she spoke, mouths all around the circle moved silently, forming the same shapes. "We all felt it."

The air between us felt thick. Heavy. Like something invisible was connecting them all, pulling them together.

George grabbed my arm. "We're leaving. Now."

We pushed through the crowd. They didn't resist, just parted like a curtain. But as we passed, I felt it – a pressure in my head. Low. Thrumming. Like standing too close to power lines.

Someone caught my wrist. A little girl. Her grip was impossible. Not a child's strength.

"She's coming back." Her voice was high and sweet. Then it dropped an octave. "For you." That last part came from somewhere deeper. Older.

George snapped. His fist cracked the little girl's jaw. She went down hard. But she didn’t cry. She just smiled up at him. Blood between her baby teeth. Then she laughed.

They all did. At the exact same moment. The same pitch. The same rhythm. Hundreds of throats making one sound.

He pulled me to the car. The crowd didn't follow. They just stood there. Every face wearing Mom's disappointment. Every face tilted at the same horrifying angle.

In the car, I pressed against the window, trembling.

"It's not her," I kept saying. "That's not her."

But we both knew better. IT WAS HER. Somehow. Fractured and spread among everyone in Gatenville. All of them sharing her thoughts. Her feelings. Her anger. A hive mind. 

George's hands shook on the steering wheel. "Kate, what the fuck is happening?"

I looked back. They were still standing there. Still watching. And behind them, on the mountain, I saw more people. Dozens more. All facing the same direction. Facing us.

Then, as one, they all took a step forward.

"Drive," I said. "Just fucking drive."

\* \* \* \* \*

Three miles out of town. Three hours from Roanoke. I was still shaking.

"What the hell was that?" George kept checking the rearview. “Kate, what the fuck was that?”

"They all knew.” My voice was flattened by the shock. “Things nobody could know. About the miscarriage. Things I never told anyone. They spoke with her voice, George. All of them.” 

BANG.

The car staggered sideways. George fought the wheel as we fishtailed across the centerline before he got us to the shoulder. 

"Fuck."

We sat there. Engine thrumming. Both of us breathing too hard. Then George got out. I watched him in the side mirror circle to the back. 

The rear tire was shredded. Torn apart like something with teeth had chewed through it.

George popped the trunk. I stayed in the car, twisting in my seat, watching the road behind us.

"George."

“I’m going as fast as I can.” 

“George.”

Something in my voice made him look up. A sheriff's cruiser. Coming slow. Too slow. 

George grabbed the tire iron. 

The cruiser stopped twenty feet back. Engine running. Then the door opened. He was huge. Six-five, maybe more. His uniform had gone stiff with old sweat. His badge was green with corrosion. The nameplate said Tucker. 

The sun had burnt and blistered his face and neck raw. But worse was the lesion eating through his left cheek. Black at the edges. Oozing something dark and thick that wasn’t blood. 

The smell hit me through the closed car door. Rancid. Rotting meat.  

George stood his ground. Iron in hand. "Just changing a flat, officer."

Tucker's eyes were yellow. Jaundiced. He looked at George but seemed to look through him.

"We all felt that, George. What you did." Tucker’s voice was all wrong. Wet. Like he was speaking through a mouthful of glass. “What you did.” 

George went rigid. Tucker stepped closer. 

I got out of the car. His head turned toward me. His neck made a sound like celery snapping. 

"Let us handle this, sweetheart." 

Mom's words, slipping past Tucker's lips. 

“We just want you to come home.” 

Tucker lurched toward George. Fast. Faster than something that size should move. 

George swung the tire iron. Everything behind it. Tucker caught it mid-swing. The metal sank into his palm with a wet crunch. He didn't react. Not a flinch. Just held it there. 

The sound of George’s wrist breaking was drowned out by his scream. 

"She wants you back, Katie. We all do."

I pulled the Maglite out from behind my back and swung as hard as I could. Connected with Tucker's face. The lesion opened. Split wide. 

I stared into the wound. Something moved underneath. Not muscle or bone. Something that pulsed. Black as motor oil. And I could’ve sworn there were eyes. Hundreds of them. Like millipede legs. 

The black seeped out of the wound. It hit the asphalt and started eating through it. The weeds at the road’s edge withered instantly where it touched.

Tucker released George and turned to face me.

"You can't hurt us, dear." They took a step forward. Tire iron still embedded in hand. “Might as well join us.” 

I circled behind the car, putting it between us. Tucker followed. Tracking me. 

Paint bubbled where the black liquid touched the hood of the car. The metal corroding instantly.

George was back on his feet. He grabbed the Maglite and swung. Again. And again. Tucker dropped. But he didn’t stop. He started crawling toward me. Hand over hand. Dragging his rotted body across the road. 

"The mountain," I said. "We have to go. Now."

George cradled his wrist against his chest. “Which way?”

I looked around. The tree line was fifty feet away. Dense. Dark. Beyond it, I could see the ridge rising up. Memories of my childhood adventures and escapes rising to the surface. 

“There.” 

We ran. Left the car. Left everything. 

Sheriff Tucker lay on the road. Then from deep in his gut came that sound – the same low rumble we’d heard when we first arrived. But louder now. Closer. Horrifying. 

In town, heads turned. Doors opened. People stepped out into the street. All of them facing the same direction. Facing us. 

The sound came again. Deeper. Like a hunger pain from the depths of the mountain. 

“Run,” George said. “Don’t stop.” 

I didn’t have to be told twice. We crashed into the woods. Sprinting. Swatting branches away from my face. Do not look back, I kept thinking. Whatever you do. Do. Not. Look. Back. 

\* \* \* \* \*

The sun dropped behind the ridge. The temperature fell with it.

"My dad used to take me up here," I said as we climbed. The trail was steep. Loose shale and pine needles made for tricky footing.

The old mine shed was somehow still standing after all these years. It was rotting wood and corrugated metal. Small holes peppered the walls. Buckshot probably. I’d seen sheds like this as a kid. Back when I was young and stupid enough to explore them. 

The door was gone. Inside, dark swallowed the light. 

“Kate,” George said. A warning. 

I wasn’t stopping. He followed me in. 

Old rusted over mining gear scattered everywhere. Pickaxes. Rope. And bones. 

"Birds," George said, nudging one aside with his boot.

I found a lantern with fuel inside. Sparked it to life. Orange filled the space.  

"Look at this."

Papers wrapped in oilcloth. Mining company letterhead. The date was water-damaged, barely visible. 1950-something.

**INCIDENT REPORT**

\[Most of the text was illegible, eaten by moisture and time\] 

>*...team found something... Thompson and Ericksson made contact... both men now refusing to leave... Retrieval team sent. Eight men...* 

\[large section missing\] 

>*...none came back... Sealing off the level...* 

\[the rest of the report was torn away\]

I found more papers. A faded map, cross-sections of every square inch of the mine. One level, deep down, circled in red pencil: **SEALED - DO NOT ENTER.**

Then George pulled a newspaper clipping, more recent.

>*Richmond company announces mine reopening. Government contract. New extraction       methods make previously unprofitable deposits viable.*

George studied the map. "Whatever was down there, they went back for it."

I looked at him. Suddenly, there was a movement in the brush outside.

A man stumbled forward. Gaunt. Bearded. Caked in filth. A CDC windbreaker hanging off him.

"Thank God. Real people." His voice cracked. "I thought I was the only one."

I kept the light on him.

"I'm not one of them." He said. 

He didn't sound like Tucker. And he sure as hell didn't move like the others.

"My name's Bennett. I've been here since April."

"Six months?"

"Yes, with CDC. The first crew came up sick." He pulled out a water bottle, took small sips. "We were called in. Tried to contain them. The readings were safe. Company said it was fine."

He scratched at his neck. Small red welts. Raw and bleeding.

"What about your team? Everyone else…"

"They went down," Bennett said, his voice distant. "To investigate. But they came back... different." He scratched harder. "They tried to make me go down too. It wouldn't take me."

"What do you mean? What’’s down there?" George asked.. 

Bennett's eyes seemed to hollow. "Something old," he whispered. "Something they never should have touched."

That guttural howl echoed up from the trail. Bennett pulled back rotting floorboards. Metal rungs disappeared into darkness.

"This way. They won't follow. Come on. It’s safe. I know a way out."

We exchanged a glance. 

“There’s no way around them if you go back the way you came.” 

We didn’t like it. But he was right. So, we descended. Me first. George next. Bennett last. 

The deeper we went, the hotter it got. I covered my mouth with my shirt. The smell – sulfur and something else – 

"Hydrogen sulfide," Bennett said. "Low enough level. Won't hurt us. Keep going."

I noticed Bennett kept touching the wall. Fingers lingering on the rock. A strange caress. 

"You said it wouldn’t *take you*?" George asked, struggling with one hand.

"That's right. All of them but me." A glow appeared ahead. "Through here."

We looked through a gap in the rock.

The cavern opened up into something massive. It was the size of a missile silo. At the base, a hundred feet down, something pulsed. 

An organism of some kind. That’s the only word I can think of for it. 

It looked like a piece of coral. But not like any I had ever seen. It was as wide as a house and its surface rippled red with a black honeycomb pattern. Each hexagonal cell expanding and contracting. Breathing like a lung. 

The rock around it seemed to be transforming. Sharp like stalactite. 

The mountain itself was transforming. Becoming something else. 

The townspeople stood in rings around it. On different levels. Old mining platforms. Carved ledges. Natural shelves of rock. All facing inward. A congregation. 

Heat shimmered in the air between them and the thing. Like fumes off concrete. They were feeding it warmth. 

Bennett grabbed my wrist. "I did as you asked."

The organism pulsed.

"Please. Take me." Desperate. He pulled off his shirt. The red welts turned to black down his torso. A gradient of old wounds where he'd pressed himself against it.

George lunged at him, but a few of the townsfolk held him back.

"It's been here forever. Before us. Before everything. We're just food that learned to talk." 

Bennett scratched at the burns. " I can be more. It's going to save us. All of us. No more suffering. Only unity."

The townspeople moved closer, ignoring Bennett. He grabbed at them, but they didn't react.

"Take me! I did everything. I brought them ALL to you. Every one of them."

The organism pulsed. Heavier. Speaking to him. To all of them. Hundreds as one. 

"Soon." Bennett collapsed. Sobbing. Laughing. A broken man. 

Slave to a master that wouldn’t have him.  

The converted pressed closer. Breathing as one. I could see it now. Everyone linked to the organism. They were its cells. 

“Katie.” 

All their mouths. A wave of sound. Then they shifted. Clearing a path. 

From the sixth ring, Mom stepped forward.
