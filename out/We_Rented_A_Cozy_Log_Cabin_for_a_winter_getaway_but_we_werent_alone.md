So me and my girlfriend Lucy live in Washington state and for the Christmas holiday, we wanted to have some fun in our lives instead of going day in and day out of our 9 to 5 jobs . so to spice things up like any other couple we decided to go to rent out a beautiful log cabin. We have been spending the last month or two eating basically instant ramen and putting the rest of our money into saving for this trip. We didn't want to just go up there for three days and head right back. That seemed like a waste of money to us , we wanted to spend at least 2 weeks to have the most pleasure and relaxation out of our getaway.
The day grew closer and closer, each day passing by we both grew more and more giddy. With each day we would catch ourselves staring at the calendar, every chance the calendar had it would steal our gaze making the wait that much more unbearable.with the last three days we spent slowly and methodically packed up what we wanted to bring. We brought three suitcases, two of them had the essentials, clothes, shower supplies, etc.. . but the third one contained miscellaneous things like flashlights for night walks , board/card games, books, and a gaming system. 

We found it on Airbnb, i think some rich guy decided to make the cabin specifically to rent it out to people. When we first saw the listing, we texted the hosts for more details, they said it was fully constructed 3 months ago. They spent the last 3 months decorating the place and adding furniture, paintings, tv’s and wifi, but they were only able to get a cheap router but they said they planned in the future to get some top of the line premium wifi. With it being brand spanking new they wanted to give us a pretty decent discount which blew my mind, they said they wanted to do something special for their first guests, but they also wanted some constructive criticism and or any notes on things that could be improved upon. 

 Before we knew it was the night before we would set out on the road. I did a last round of checks to make sure we got everything packed up and ready for the morning. All we needed to do was grab our phone chargers before we left. After I made sure we got everything I made my way back to the bedroom to lie down and go to bed with lucy. As i arrived she wasn't there, i scanned the room to try and find her but to no avail. “Hey lucy?” I call out to the silent air while still looking around, as I’m scanning the room I hear her gentle soft voice say “im in here” I turn to face our small walk-in closet with the door open by a couple inches with the lights turned off inside. It felt like the darkness from within the closet clutch my soul with an iron grip, my heart began beating rapidly. I inch my way slowly to the door and mutter “ h-hey what are you doing in there?” She responds “hey are you ok? I’m right here”  at this point i'm reaching out towards the door , my fingers meet the soft wood grain and i begin to push. The door slowly swings open, I get but a glimpse of a faint light. 

I blink, reality has come back to me, the closet is fully lit and empty , I feel a soft hand with a gentle grip from my shoulder. I turn and face the owner of the hand , it’s Lucy’s, my heart already slowing down. “ Hey Ramona, what’s going on? Are you ok?” she asked with concern in her voice. “Ya i just thought you were in the closet” i say with a dry mouth and my tongue feeling like sandpaper. I lock eyes with her and immediately  the sense of fear and dread begging to fade away, her on the other hand concern and worry growing. “What are you talking about? I was in the kitchen grabbing a snack. Are you sure you're ok?” “ya” i say confidently, “this trip has gotten me really excited is all”. I could tell she didn't buy it. her arm slips down from my shoulder along my arm to my hand and with her other hand coming up to grab my other hand and laces her fingers in mine. 

“I know you have trouble talking about things sometimes, but I'm here for you ok?” “ I know you are and that's one of the million things that I love about you”  I say as i unlace my fingers from hers and grab a medicine bottle. “So how are those working for you so far?” “Oh there great, I can get some actual sleep for once. But they can be pretty hard to wake up from "I say then down two of the off white pills with some water “Do you think you'll bring them with us tomorrow?” “ya probably but I’ll try not to use them when i can”. “I mean who knows i might need my knight in shining armor to come save me in the middle of the night” she says as i turn to face her laying on top of the blankets wearing one of my hoodies and pajama pants. I crawl onto the bed and then onto lucy “don't worry your majesty, i'll be there when you can't find the Tv remote” that made  her giggle and it brought a smile to my face, i brought my face down to hers and she closed her eyes and pursed her lips and I did the same, before our lips could touch, my face was met by a pillow. That made both of us laugh, I rolled off of her onto the vacant side of the bed and continued to laugh. After the laughter subsided I kissed her on the forehead and we said good night to each other and drifted off to sleep. 

After sleep had swallowed me whole, I woke up standing in the middle of a tremendously long wooden hallway with paintings sparsed across the walls. Down one side was pitch darkness and the other had a dull pale white light emanating from the end. I shield my eyes from the light and try to see anything past it. I saw what seemed like a black beak. My heart begins to pick up in pace , I quickly try to ground myself and tell myself “this isn't real” trying to force myself to wake up but to no avail. The beak is now growing longer from the light, a withered frail arm accompanying the beak grasping at the air in front of it. With my heart now racing I pivot and turn to start sprinting in the opposite direction. 

As I'm running down the hallway the wooden paneling starts to deteriorate and become moldy, the paintings become frayed and torn with rips and claw marks. I glance back over my shoulder and the arm continues to grow, getting closer and closer. I quickly turn back, an abrupt sharp right turn appears. I tried to slow down to make the turn, but instead I slammed into the wall with my left shoulder. The air around me becomes cold and my lungs fill with a sharp pain, like if a bunch of serrated knives are being juggled around inside me. But I pressed on and more sharp turns appeared to the point where I had to jog in order to make the turn without slamming into the wall. 

I felt the hand grasp at the back of my neck, then around my whole neck ,slowing me down as it pulled back. I lunged at one of the corners with an iron grip, breaking the wood and my nails in the process. Before the creature could pull me back I grasped the corner with both of my hands , subsequently the hands around my throat tightened its grasp and pierced its nails and fingers into the muscle of my neck and are now trying to break into my throat. I fought against it desperately pulling away from it, I managed to get merely a glimpse around the corner. I saw a door, my escape, my freedom, my only chance to get away from this thing. with my throat and lungs in an icy death grip I persisted and pulled what little strength i had remaining and hoisted myself around the corner. I felt the fingers tear through my neck. It was like If i had frozen ice cold meat hooks yanking me back to hell, but without a moment's hesitation I busted down the door. 

As I step out, heavy snowfall and the cold chilling air carving its way onto my face and into my neck, i try to catch my breath but the freezing cold air tears away at my lungs. With my head over my knees I look around and see thick pine trees ,unable to see past them i look back towards the door but it has been replaced by trees. Still unable to catch my breath I collapse onto the snow on my back and I look up and see the moon surrounded by the trees.  But shadowy hands burst from the trees and start to collapse around the moon, suffocating its saving light from my eye. After the moon disappears I feel the weight of the same hands surrounding and closing in on me. I thrash about helplessly. The hands start grabbing and tearing at my skin, i scream in pain and writhe on the ground, trying to put an end to this torture but it didnt stop. With the tearing of my skin and with each heavy being met with what felt like glass shards was pure hell on earth.
