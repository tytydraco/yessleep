I stood alone in the downpour. My best suit drenched and sodden in the tumultuous rain; But I didn't care as I stared down at the grave of my beloved wife. Her name was Elmira and as I had looked it up one day out of curiosity, means "electrification of the world". She didn't light up the world but she did to mine. Every precious moment spent in her company was never taken for granted. Every kiss and hug; Every heartfelt conversation and tender touch. All the times we made love and felt each others hearts race against one another, breathed in each other's sweet breaths, marked each other with hickeys and touched one another as though our flesh was each others personal braille. And on this day, September 27th, in the year of our Lord, was the anniversary of the day her soul departed from her precious body as the thing from the forest dug it's head into her stomach and worked it's way through her insides to her heart.

She went on one of her walks into our forest as I was overwhelmed at work and unable to make it home on that beautiful evening. When I came home that day the door was open and everything was a mess. Everything was torn into and there was blood in streaks along the wall. I didn't bother calling out, I followed the streaks upstairs to our bedroom in a rush. Our bed was torn into, and as I looked closer, Elmira's panties were stuffed into one of the gouges in it. There had been a thick, viscous fluid over it. And that was enough to drive me over the fucking edge as I tore at the gun safe, my fingers shaking with fury and misdialing the combination before getting it right and taking out the handgun. And as I held death in my hand, my heart thundering, blood roaring in my ears, every muscle taught and tense, I looked back at the bed; Knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt that I would not find my soul mate alive as I teared down the stairs and through the house and into the silence of the forest. Regardless of her being dead, I needed to find her. To see her. To be with her one last time and hold her body in my arms.

I didn't need to look to and fro everywhere for her in our forest. I had an idea of where she would be. The gravel spot by the stream would be the ideal and most likely spot she would have gone to, since the sussurations of the babbling water and the sweet melodies of the song birds was where she had found peace in the midst of the darkness of her schizophrenia. And almost like a prayer to the devil, I was rewarded with the sight of her naked body by the stream. Her hands stiffened by rigor mortis into claws of desperation as her arms clutched at her torn open body. The raw fear still captured in her precious golden amber eyes as a single tear fell down from them.

Nothing in the world registered to me at all but the all consuming black hole of emptiness pierced where my heart use to be. I dropped the gun and fell to my knees beside her on the cold, hard gravel. The volcanic hot rage almost completely dissipating into the background of my being as I dared to raise a tremulous hand to where her heart use to be and I had found her body was still warm. I don't remember how long I was with her. I don't want to remember that horrid look in her face. I don't want to remember all that blood and how her insides looked like. I can't fucking bear the mountainous weight of such soul engulfing despair. But it still haunts me to this very day, every time I close my eyes, every time I dare to feel an ounce of hope, every time i'm in silence like how I was with her on that day. I can't stand it. Dear God Almighty don't make me bear it.

But bear it I did. Lived with it all these year I did.

And once you've been in Hell, you never come back.

Everything is changed irrevocably. Everything becomes a testament to how much you can endure. And especially living with the never ending rage building up, second by second; Magnifying in every moment. Becoming nurtured by hatred until its crystalline and pure to the point of becoming something primal that needs to sink it's teeth into the flesh of the demon that dared take away my Elmira from me. That dared to foment such thought.

I don't remember how long I was with her but I remember as clear as day what I felt when the rage edged it's way back to the front of my being; To completely consuming my being to the point of stark crimson taking over my vision and every inch of my body becoming taught and tense again.

I didn't know what it was and if I could kill it, but I didn't care. If I found it, I would do everything to kill it even if it meant dying myself. And I did find it again eventually. Almost a decade later. After building myself up in the gym everyday and adding incredibly to my already immense strength, I found it feasting on a child it took.

I almost wept with such joy at finally finding it. After endless, fruitless searching, after the simultaneous urges of not giving into that all consuming black hole of a void in my chest and feeding and nurturing the searing rage, I had finally found the bastard killer after it had ambushed a family that been camping. Their ungodly screams of pain and terror were loud and engulfing in that same silence in the forest of the day it happened to Elmira. And even then I didn't need to follow the screams as it had picked apart the family while they had been on the run from it. I followed the pieces of their bodies and the smears of gore spattering everything alongside the claw marks engraving the ground and trees in its desperate pursuit of them. I followed it's trail until I had heard the wet sounds of flesh tearing and came upon what must have been the father, he had been so disfigured I almost couldn't tell what he was. But I was able to as he lay in a pool of gore, grasping at genitals that weren't there. The same look of traumatic terror on his face as he looked through the thing's thick, viscous fluid in strands over his eyes and face at what it had done to him. I looked up from him to the creature, to the demon slowly munching on the nameless father's child. Taking its time and enjoying every second of the flesh it had in it's monstrous claws. It's back was to me but it was hairless, and it's skin grey. The muscles in it's body moving languidly under that sickly grey skin as it tore and teared. The small pure white, forked horns on its head moving as though they almost had a mind of their own. It looked humanoid from behind.

I looked back at the disfigured body of what use to be human barely clinging to life as I raised my handgun to point at the father's head and pulled the trigger twice; Making my presence loud and clear as it stiffened. It layed the body of it's last victim on the blood soaked ground with the utmost care before it stood up from it's crouched position of sitting cross legged. It wasn't tall as I thought it would be. Maybe a couple more inches on my 6'2 height. It slowly turned without a care in the world and when it faced me completely, I admit I felt a stark naked terror strike deep within my chest at it's appearance. It's eyes pierced into all that I was, the dull red irises surrounded by stygian blackness staring in a daze at me before it registered who I was and then the dull red suddenly lit up into fierce bright crimson; Illuminating the demonic life force behind those atrocious and hungry eyes. Its male anatomy rose and stiffened as its muscles rippled beneath its sickening skin as it flexed it's strength as though to proclaim that despite my own, that it was all in futile; That I came here to be torn apart and savaged under God's watchful eye as He would do nothing to stop my dismemberment. That I would suffer the same fate as Elmira and all its victims throughout the years. I would be no different from such prey.

But as I once stated, once you've been to Hell, you will never come back. I've changed. I have grown stronger from the unending searing rage. I've learned every possible way to kill. I've been tested to the very limits of a soul corrupting madness that hadn't made me end myself.

I stared back into those vile eyes as I dropped the gun. The crimson that had overtaken my vision that catastrophic day I found my soulmate desecrated and disemboweled beginning to once again seep into everything. Every muscle going tense and taught and aching, screaming to be used, to be put to the test. My fingers tremulous as I reached to one of my bowie sheathes and unbuckled the strap. My fingers curling around the handle and tightening in a white knuckle grip as I pulled out the wicked blade. My teeth baring into a vicious rictus grin just like it's own.

Finally.

We sprinted towards each other without sound as I tackled into it, wrapping my powerful arms around it and attempting to slam it into the ground. It stumbled backwards with my weight and force and I didn't wait or think as I rammed my bowie knife into its side, deep enough to hear it scrape against what must have been bone. But that one piercing strike was all I had got in as I felt it's sharp teeth pierce into my shoulder and lift all of my weight and body up and shaked me like a God damned rag doll, my limbs flailing, before it tossed me into the ground. I hit the blood soaked ground on my stomach and felt the wind get knocked out of me but it only stopped me very briefly as I rolled over before it's talons stomped into what would have been my back and most likely would have paralyzed me, ending the long awaited vengeance. But it didn't as I reached for another bowie knife on my belt and slammed it into it's thigh, hoping against hope that I would have hit a vital artery if it had any. It didn't scream in pain but grunted softly as though in amusement. Hearing that didn't make my anger falter with fear but enflamed it, stoke the need to rip it piece to piece. I yanked the knife out with a spurt of bright red blood and quickly, almost effortlessly got to my feet as I got into a stance ready to strike or counter attack.

It was the latter and just barely as it moved so God damn fast with its jaws snapping shut with a loud audible snap of teeth on the space only a few inches away from where my neck would have been if I hadn't moved quick enough and then moved against it, wrapping my arm around it's shoulders as it looked surprised. I quickly slammed the bowie knife into it's chiseled, hard stomach again and again, putting all my strength into each and every blow I got in as I held its God damn sickly body there with my other arm. Its skin warm and smooth. Its blood spurting out in gouts as it struggled against me, as it struggled to break free as it punched at me, beat at me, tore at my body with its claws. The pain was intense, the pain was unbearable with its strength and hatred. But it was nothing compared to what I felt as I digged into the side of it's neck with my teeth that had waited too long. Tearing into that warm and firm flesh I chewed and bit again and again in tandem with the stabbing.

I barely registered the warm thick ropes of its intestines as it started to spill out against my hand. I barely registered its black and cold tears as it spilled down its cheek and onto my face. I did register that scream it did let out as it sank to one knee, still trying it's hardest with waning strength to get away from me, to make me stop. It was the sound of a primal fear that renewed my hatred, my unending rage. I let go of the knife and dragged my face away from it's greatly torn neck as it feebly raised its shaking clawed hands to its neck at first and then its intestines spilling out and then back to its neck; Completely unsure of which to comfort the most, to try to make the pain stop.

And that sight alone, at it realizing it can be hurt and that pain was completely alien to the creature, to the demon; It made the darkness of the black hole in my chest be replaced with a surge of life, with an utmost pleasure that I hadn't felt since the last time I held Elmira against me and felt her heart beat against mine. And thinking of that last precious moment with her, who I should have spent the rest of my life with, that beautiful woman I should have had children with, that suffered more than enough from her schizophrenia, it fucking drove me past the point of no return.

I don't remember if it was hours or days but by the time I had finally come to my senses, I was covered in the killer's blood and my hands were broken and raw. My strength was completely evaporated from me as I feebly tried to raise my hand and curl it into a fist for another punch at it's obliterated face. I couldn't curl it at all. I couldn't even move my fingers. I finally collapsed on my back on the side of its corpse. My chest heaving with exertion as every muscle in my body screamed in exhaustion. My tears coming uncontrollably as the berserk red slowly ebbed from my vision. As the rage had finally found the peace to be calm among the dead that surrounded me. As I stared up at the Heavens and wondered ever so briefly in the roaring vacuum that the rage had left that if Elmira was looking down from where she was. If she was proud of me finally getting revenge.

That is a question I still ask myself as I look up at the Heavens now through the downpour. If not proud at what I had to do as a man, then be proud of me as her soulmate still continuing on in her death; Of finding a purpose where the rage had left. I looked back down at her gravestone and then walked to be near it. I took my hand out of my suit pocket and raised that tremulous hand to touch her gravestone one last time for now. My hands never healed properly and I don't much care anymore. I did what I needed and I don't regret it. I don't care about that family I couldn't save or all the others that fell victim. I don't care that no one will ever believe what happened. I care that I finally killed your killer Elmira. I care that it didn't get away with what it did to you. I hope against hope that someday when my soul departs my body, that I join you in the kingdom and finally know peace with you.

But once you've been in Hell, you will never come back.
