Things got worse after that. 

Kindergarten was a pain. I quickly learned that I was a sensitive child; prone to panic and hysteria. Mom said I was just a gentle spirit and that crowds "weren't my thing." Dad told me I needed to toughen up. His solution was to make me responsible for Sammy's training. According to my dad, Sammy was only allowed on furniture by invitation, was always to be present when I answered the door, and had specific command phrases he had to know. They were the typical things: "sit, down, stay, come, heel, off," and "no." It wasn't easy. I was barely five years old and I was training a seven-month old Rottweiler that was already big enough to ride. It came in handy though whenever I'd wake up in the middle of the night to find Sammy perched over me, looking out the window. 

"Down!" I'd hiss, trying not to be loud enough to wake my sisters. His head would glance in my direction for half a second before snapping back to look outside. This would happen for several nights. I wasn't having any nightmares, but that's because I was too stressed to sleep. I'm not sure I even remember this properly, but apparently that's the story I told my Mom. 

"You were so scared about starting school," she told me years later when I brought it up. "That's why we put that lock on your window. Sammy could probably sense your unease too. He was such a good dog."

Sammy wasn't just a good dog; he was an amazing protector. Over the next few months, he became my best buddy. He and I would wrestle and play and go on walks. The Kitters would send the cops over because of our "aggressive dog" but, honestly, Old Man Wilkin's cat was more aggressive that Sammy. Sammy growled a lot, but Rottis do that as a sign of affection *and* aggression, so who's to say?

By winter break, Sammy obeyed all seven of the core commands and knew several tricks. Our favorite trick was "bang!" This was before the internet so I learned about it when one of the cops the Kitters called on us told me that Sammy could "play dead" as if I shot him and being a kid, that sounded cool. I'd get home from school, burst through the front door with finger guns blazing and yell "Bang!" Sammy would leap like a rabbit out of my room and flop onto his side dramatically, smile wide, eyes fixed on me and waiting for me to say "good boy!"

My sleep had improved significantly by this point. No more nightmares, no more unease. Even Sammy slept soundly. That Christmas, my Dad's parents reached out. They had been wracked with guilt for years and finally worked up the courage to beg for forgiveness. They wanted to know their grandchildren. My parents reluctantly agreed that they could visit on Christmas Eve. 

That day, I met my Dad's parents. I don't remember anything about that day, honestly, other than treating them like the strangers they were. I wouldn't hug them or engage in conversation. I would just show them Sammy's tricks. Sammy seemed to like them immediately, which did ease me a bit. After dinner, they said a teary goodbye and wished us a merry Christmas. 

That night, Sammy was on high alert. My Dad later said it's because the grandparents spooked him, but I don't think that was it. 

I was in bed, having one of my out-of-body dreams again. I was observing myself, but I didn't feel like I was a second me. I was just... seeing my room, like a camera on a tripod facing my bed. Sammy suddenly perked up and faced the window again. I was fed up. I was a frustrated 5-year-old. I looked down at my body and *demanded* that I wake up. 

Then I heard a loud tap.

My gaze lurched back to the window and I saw someone at the edge of the shadows again. This time, though, they didn't run. Sammy growled at them. His fur prickling and standing on edge. His face twisted into a snarl. I felt sick to my stomach. The figure took a step forward. 

"GET MOM!" my own voice shouted from the bed. My body was sitting up, head slack, eyes wide open but rolled back into my skull. My hand hung loosely in the air, pointing towards the bedroom door. "GET MOM! GET MOM! GET MOM!"

I tried to run out of the room, but every step was like moving through quickly-drying cement. I panicked. I couldn't breathe. The girls were screaming. Sammy started barking. My body yelled "GET MOM! GET MOM!"

I glanced at the window and saw the finger plunge into the shadows and out of sight. Sammy tore from my bed, sprinting in a mad dash out of the room, and knocking my body over. I felt the impact, felt him slam into me, felt my head hit the pillow and I felt dizzy. My eyes opened and I was back in my body, my arm still outstretched towards the open bedroom door. 

My sisters were crying and I started panicking. My Dad was already by the front door when my Mom rushed in. She asked what was happening and the girls said I just started screaming. *I* scared them. I told my Mom my dream and she told me that I didn't need to worry. She took all of us to her room and we slept in her bed that night. 

On Christmas morning, we opened a couple small presents and ate our breakfasts with glee. The nightmare of last night melted away when we drank hot coco and scarfed down homemade waffles. I remember getting Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figure. Donatello. Classic. I went to put him on my windowsill where some other knick knacks and toys waited for me, but as I stood him up, my gaze slid down along the windowsill to the latch. 

A long, thin crack had formed along the glass near the latch and lock was missing.
