Hi, I've been dreaming the same house for my whole life practically, but it hasn't appeared in my dreams for years. The first time I dreamt it, I was 5 years old.

1st dream: I got kidnapped by a man that took me to this square-ish house where he had lots of children. He offered us food but I was afraid it was poisonous. I wanted to escape but could not do so.

2nd dream: I was about 11 when I dreamt this, the same house was some sort of place that kept children, and there were many nurses. I escaped and ran away but the "main" nurse found me and took me back.

3rd-5th dream - From the ages of 11-13 I had 3 dreams in this house with no action, just exploring the house, so I'll describe it.
From the outside, the house was gray, square (very brutalist) with a flat roof. it had around 4 floors. 
The first floor was very clean, equipped with dark brown wood furniture and floor. It's quite beautiful actually, at the end of the main hall there is a stairway that goes both left and right.
Once you go upstairs, the first floor already has very old furniture, everything has a yellow tint. It's a bit dusty in here, and the popcorn ceiling and wall give it a very antique vibe.
The 3rd floor is mostly gray, very dusty, with some furniture here and there covered by white bedsheets, there also is one room that is completely empty. It just looks abandoned. 
To reach the 4th floor ( which was kind of an attic) you had to climb the ladder in the corner of the empty room, however it was pitch black in there and I was not "allowed" to ever go there.

6th dream: When I was 13, I dreamt I was in an institution where they kept children (either an orphanage or a mental ward). After a failed escape attempt, the nurses working there dragged me to a room on the second floor and locked me there along with other children. The room had pale yellow walls and a single window on the left wall. Frustrated, I wanted to jump out the window in order to escape, but the other kids stopped me from doing so.

The nurses came to bring food to the children, and I snuck behind them and ran down the stairs to the 1st floor. Suddenly, I had a hallucination, and I was in my kitchen. My parents and grandparents were having a discussion at the dining table. I was sobbing and screaming my lungs out, saying things like "I'm stuck in that house, please help me, get me out" but they were ignoring me. Out of the blue, my mother's head twists towards me , and while maintaing eye contact she says "You're crazy". I snapped out of the hallucination and felt two men grab my arms and drag me to the room again. They also get a radio (it seemed very old, like 1900s old, the whole dream had a very old vibe). After they started playing the song, I covered my ears and started crying.

7th-9th dream: The next 3 dreams occured when I was 14, and they happened consecutively (2 nights in a row + one long nap the next day). I don't remember the details from each dream, however it was the same story continued through all three of them:

I was at home with my brother and mother when we received the news that my father had died. We were devastated but we had to pull through. Unfortunately, after some time we had to sell our house and we moved to a trailer. Life went on for some time, but one day, while coming back from school and passing through a tunnel, I received a phone call. It was my dad. I picked up, and suddenly everything was blue, I could hear ghostly whispers and a shiver ran down my spine. When I arrived to our trailer, I was clearly distraught and my mother noticed. I kept the phone call a secret from her for some time, but it was tearing me apart and I told her.

After telling her, she told me we would be moving. The next day, we went to see the house, the same house I had been dreaming for years, and to meet my "sisters" (I have no sisters, the 2 "sisters" worked at the house). This time, the first floor was still brown, but it looked less furnished than in the other dreams. It somehow looked similar to my grandparent's house. My mother did not, in fact, move there with me, she just left me there.


Ever since, I haven't really dreamt anything about this house, only some small glimpses of it in some dreams. I vaguely remember dreaming something of it around one year ago, but I forgot the dream minutes after waking up.

What's really crazy is that one friend of mine had the same dream as me (6th dream) around the same time, before we even met. She described the house to me in perfect detail.

TL; DR: I have been dreaming of a square house with 4 floors all my life. It's some sort of mental ward(I think). It gets progressively more abandoned as you ascend. Every time I dream it, I seem to feel stuck and want to escape.
