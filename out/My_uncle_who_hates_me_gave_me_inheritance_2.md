Okay so I was planning to post an update yesterday but was absolutely swarmed for new years, so here is the update now.

Since my last post up till new years everything was pretty much the same, just a few noises and random stuff being misplaced/opened. Until yesterday. I woke up at I think around 1pm due to a new years hangover and me getting home late. Due to me being hungover I just could not be bothered with anything, especially not my uncles creepy fucking house. Not even an hour after waking up I hear knocking at my bedroom door, and just like any person who does in a horror movie, I opened the door. Nothing there. I close the door. I go back to my bed to watch tv. Knocking starts again. 

At this point I couldn’t be bothered reacting. I have dealt with this bullshit for longer than I can handle, which granted isn’t long but still. So I ignored the knocking, and eventually it stopped (have I finally found a way to get over this? No). All of a sudden there’s 3 loud bangs, like breaking and entering level loud bangs, it scared the living shit out of me obviously. After that I’ll admit all I wanted to do is act like a child and hide under my covers. But then I remembered I’d be posting this to Reddit and would want to look cool, so I got up and walks out my room, I looked around for a moment before my door legit slammed behind me. Now you know those moments in life where you gain fearlessness? Like when you stop running up the stairs when it’s dark? This was not one of those moments, I booked it out of the house. 

I called my girlfriend, Hailey and asked her if I could stay with her for a few days. She agreed (thank god) and I started making my way to her house. Now im gonna stop with the jokes and get serious cause I could have swore, about half way to her house, I saw someone in the rear view mirror, sitting in the backseat, I glanced back but saw nothing. But I know I saw something, whether it was my overthinking or genuinely something, I don’t know. But I know I saw something, real or not I saw it. The rest of the drive was pretty much full of overly happy music so I don’t cry of fear and non stop glancing at the rear view mirror. 

Eventually I get to Haileys house. There was a few jokes about me running away here and there. But other than that nothing else happened, until like 30 minutes ago. My girlfriend came into the room and all she said was “Just going to ignore me?” I was obviously confused so I questioned her on it, in short, she was hearing footsteps in the living room (she was in the kitchen next to it) and assumed it was me, she had called out for me like 6 times but it wasn’t me so I didn’t answer. I have been in her room, in bed for the past hour. I don’t know much about this stuff but is it possible for things to follow or attach to you this quickly? Or is it just an awful coincidence?
