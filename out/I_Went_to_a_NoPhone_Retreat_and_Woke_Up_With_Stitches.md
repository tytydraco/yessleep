They called it a luxury detox. No phones, no clocks, no screens of any kind. Just a week to “reconnect with your inner stillness,” they said. The retreat was tucked away in the high desert, surrounded by red rock and silence. Private casitas. Organic meals. Cold plunges. Daily yoga under the sky.

It sounded exactly like what I needed.

They took my phone at the front gate. Smiled. Told me this was my first step toward “freedom.” I signed the waiver. Posed for a welcome photo. They gave me soft linen clothes in muted earth tones and led me to my casita. No mirrors. No caffeine. No time.

Everything was beige. Everything whispered.

At first, I liked it. The food was clean. The air was sharp and herbal. I slept better than I had in months. The guides were all young and calm and eerily beautiful. They said things like “You’re not lost. You’re remembering,” and “Let go of time. You’re here now.”

The other guests seemed normal at first, quiet, exhausted-looking professionals, probably overworked and overstimulated like me. But after two days, no one made eye contact anymore. Conversations stopped. Meals were silent. Yoga was silent. Even the birds seemed to go quiet.

I asked a guide how long we’d been there. She didn’t answer, just smiled and pressed her hand to my chest. “Feel this. That’s all that matters now.”

That night, I woke up to someone standing at the foot of my bed.

They didn’t move. They didn’t speak.

By the time I sat up, they were gone.

My door was still locked from the inside. I told myself it was a dream. That my brain was just misfiring from all the silence and strange food.

The next morning, we began “grounding ceremonies.” Long periods of humming. Chanting in slow, deep rhythms. It made the floor vibrate under my feet. I felt dizzy. Unmoored.

I leaned toward the woman next to me and whispered, “Doesn’t this feel… weird?”

She didn’t respond. She didn’t even blink.

That night, she was gone.

A guide announced that she had been “energetically discharged.”

I asked if I could leave too. The guide smiled, almost sympathetically. “You’re not ready to return. The discomfort is part of the release.”

That night, my door wouldn’t open. From the inside. I banged on it until my hands hurt. No one came.

In the morning, a different guide brought me a small ceramic cup of tea and placed it gently by my bed.

“You’ve been shifted to a higher integration track,” she whispered.

I didn’t drink the tea.

I started pretending. Pretending to chant. Pretending to sleep. I kept my eyes open just enough to see shadows moving through my room at night.

They come in when you’re unconscious. Sometimes alone. Sometimes in pairs. They touch things. Adjust your bedding. Place something cold on your forehead.

Once, I swear I heard whispering. Soft, rhythmic phrases like someone praying under their breath.

I had enough. I left the next morning. Or rather, they let me leave.

No fanfare, no ceremony, just a silent, stone-faced escort to the front gate where my phone was returned to me, fully charged and powered off.

The woman who handed it over, the same one who brought me the tea, smiled faintly as I took it from her. And before turning away, she said, “You’ll feel the benefits more clearly once your body adjusts.”

I thought she meant the diet.

It wasn’t until hours later, somewhere on the drive home, that I reached up to scratch my neck and winced.

I pulled over at a gas station bathroom and checked the mirror. There was a bandage behind my ear.

Fresh. Taped down neatly. I peeled it back with shaking hands.

Six stitches.

Tidy. Pink. Still healing.

And for the first time since I arrived at that place, I remembered something else that one of the guides said to us during a “closing breathwork circle” before we were dismissed:

“We’re so honored to hold space for your transformation… even if you don’t remember what you’ve left behind.”

I didn’t understand what that meant then.

Now, I’m terrified to find out.
