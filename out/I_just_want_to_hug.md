  
Thinking back to that night still gives me chills; even now, after so many years, I'm unsure of what happened or if it even really happened. I'm writing this as a warning: Never go alone!  
Everything started when my buddy Lucas and I were going to a party one Saturday night, but it wasn’t just any party—it was our first party. You see, Lucas and I were never really popular during middle school, but when we started high school, we somehow managed to sneak into the cool group of guys, and after just a few months, they invited us to this party—the party I would remember for the rest of my life.

  
At that time, we couldn’t have been older than 16. Nervously, we met up with our dealer just thirty minutes before the party under a bridge to pick up our 12 cans of Heineken light beer. We weren’t sure if it would be enough, but we didn’t want to get too drunk in front of our new friends, so it had to do.

  
The guy who was throwing the party, Matias, lived in a huge, impressive house that screamed that his parents were wealthy business people. We left my house at 8:30 PM, half an hour after the party had started. The walk there wasn’t long; the path we took went through a forest, and the cold October night chilled us to the bone. It took us barely 15 minutes to reach Matias’ house. The sight of the house almost made our jaws drop—it was a large white house with two tall floors, and the backyard alone was as big as my entire house. The house had a beautiful black tile roof, and a large fence stretched from corner to corner.  
We rang the doorbell that was placed at the gate. A voice answered—it was Matias. Loud music was playing in the background, so we could barely hear what he was saying, but we took it as a welcome when the gate clicked and unlocked. We walked through the gate and up to the door, and just as we were about to knock, the door swung open, and there stood Matias with a bottle of vodka in his hand. “Hey guys! Come on in, it’s crazy in here!” Matias said. Both Lucas and I didn’t really know what to say, so we just said thanks.  
The party was awesome; everyone there was from our school, and it was really going full throttle.

  
One of Matias’ friends, who went to a different high school than us, suddenly came up to me, patted me on the back, and said, “Hey man, great to see you here!” Then he suddenly lowered his voice, “So here’s the thing, I’ve got something amazing, and I want to make sure you really remember this night. Here’s what we’ll do—you come with me to the bathroom, and we’ll make sure this is a night to remember.”  
At the time, I didn’t really know what to say or what the heck he was talking about, but now, the only thing I regret is saying yes.  
I followed him into the bathroom, and he locked the door behind us. He pulled out a bag filled with what looked like mushrooms. He reached into the bag, took out a mushroom, and handed it to me. “Here, take it,” he said.  
“Nah, I don’t know, I’ve never tried anything like this before. I’m scared it’ll make me feel sick,” I replied.  
“Come on, this might be your only chance in life. It’ll make you feel like you’re king of the world, trust me,” he said.  
I did the one thing I’d regret for the rest of my life—you could say it was the biggest mistake of my life. I reached out, took the mushroom, put it in my mouth, and swallowed it.  
“Nice, that’s how it’s done,” he exclaimed. “Do you feel anything?” he asked after a moment.  
“No, nothing yet,” I said honestly.  
“Okay, get out there and party then. I gotta take a piss, and don’t forget, tonight, you’re the king,” he said.

  
I wish to this day that this was the last memory I had of that night. It would’ve been such a relief if my brain had just shut off at that moment.  
I kept partying, and Lucas and I were already halfway through our beers. But suddenly, it felt like the world froze, like nothing was moving anymore, and I locked eyes on something outside in the backyard—something moving, something gigantic, maybe 5 meters long, zigzagging its way around. It had black, glossy, reptile-like skin, and the sound it made—it sounded like it was right behind me, like the sound was inside my head. I remember thinking that it couldn’t be real, that it must just be the mushroom playing tricks on my brain, but I just couldn’t take my eyes off it. It must be the mushroom, I thought, but despite that, I stood there frozen, with chills that I was sure could be seen through my white shirt.  
Lucas suddenly shook me and snapped me out of my gaze from the creature in the backyard. 

“What’s wrong with you, man? You’ve been standing here for half a minute just staring out into the backyard,” he said.  
“Uh... I don’t know. I must have zoned out, sorry. I feel sick, I think I need to go home,” I said hastily.  
“Okay, I get it. Do you want me to come with you?” Lucas asked.  
“No, but thanks anyway, have fun,” I replied.  
“Alright, feel better then,” he said.  
When I put my shoes on, the fear was still inside me—I just couldn’t get the image of that creature in the backyard out of my head. I shivered as I tied my shoes, and when I closed the door behind me, I heard that hissing, snake-like sound again, but this time, it sounded like it was trying to say something to me. “Come to me, I want to hug you,” the voice said, with a lisp after every word.  
The words made me freeze in place. I remember the feeling to this day—it was like my legs didn’t want to follow my commands. I felt the fear take over my whole body, but I had to get home.

  
I walked down the dark stone steps, keeping my eyes down to stay steady. As my feet hit the ground, I heard the snake-like sound again, but not in my head this time. “Come to me,” I heard to my left where the sound came from.  
I couldn’t believe my eyes—what I saw, who I saw, was the most terrifying thing I’ve ever seen.  
It was a snake with black skin, two sharp fangs, and a tongue as big as a spatula. The snake had grown—it was at least 10 meters long now and a meter wide. Its red, reptile eyes were locked onto me.

 I stood there, frozen. It slithered toward me and was barely two meters away now, but I really couldn’t move. My eyes refused to break contact with the snake’s eyes.  
Suddenly, it lunged at me, but I managed to dodge at the last second, though I felt something sharp graze my arm. When that happened, it was like my legs unlocked, and adrenaline forced me to run. I threw open the gate and ran so fast that my mouth filled with the taste of blood. I quickly entered the forest path, and when I did, I looked back, but all I saw was black skin covering the entire entrance to the path.  
It had grown again; now it was as wide as the street. This can’t be possible, I thought, but then I remembered my arm. I looked down at it—a large wound stretched from my upper arm to my forearm. It was as real as it could get.  
I need to get home now! I kept running through the forest, dodging all the slippery roots and rocks. It felt like I was flying now, and far ahead, I could see the streetlamp, the one that lit up my entire street.

  
My body filled with hope—hope of surviving, hope of crawling into my bed and forgetting everything that had happened, hope that none of this was real.  
“Come to me, I just want to hug you.” The streetlamp went out—or rather, it was covered by something. Something black and huge with a leathery texture. The hope I had died the second the snake’s eyes opened, eyes now as big as footballs, lighting up the whole night. They stared straight at me, but then they closed again, and it looked like the snake kept slithering forward. But it still blocked the only exit that led to my house. Back, I could run back and take another route home.  
I turned around quickly, but no—it couldn’t be true, it must be impossible. A part of the snake was still covering where I had entered the forest, but now it looked closer to me. It wasn’t just closer there, but the part that covered the exit was also nearer now.  
“I want to hug you!” it hissed now.  
I turned toward the sound that came from the forest, and my eyes met two red lights—the snake’s eyes. It was closer now, just 10 meters away from me in every direction, and there was nothing I could do. All hope was gone.

  
7 meters away now, it was closing in fast. Every tree it touched turned to smoke.  
5 meters left. This must be a dream, I’ll wake up at the last second, I thought, but the wound on my arm felt so real.  
3 meters. I sat down with my back against a tree and waited to wake up from the dream.  
1 meter. “I’m going to hug you, I’ve got you now,” I heard the snake say. I saw how the snake’s skin covered my entire field of vision. I looked up one last time at the moon as I felt the snake’s grip around me tighten and tighten. I felt the air in my lungs running out. I wasn’t scared anymore—there was no hope left. How my life would end was already decided. Finally, I passed out.

  
I woke up to the sound of chirping birds. The sun was shining on me. I was still sitting where I had sat down the night before by the tree. My whole body ached. Relief filled me with joy—it had all just been a hallucination from the mushroom.  
I stood up slowly, but everything stung. Why did it hurt so much? Had I fallen while running yesterday and forgotten? I remembered the arm and what my imaginary snake had done to it. I laughed a little out of relief.  
But then I felt a sudden pain in my arm—it stung like nothing I could describe. I looked down and couldn’t believe my eyes. On my arm, carved into my skin, were the words, “Come here, I just want to hug you.”

  
The scar from that night forces me to remember it; there’s no avoiding it. Every time I look down at my arm, I hear the voice: “Come to me, I just want to hug you.”
