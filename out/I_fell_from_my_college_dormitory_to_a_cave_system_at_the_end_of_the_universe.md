I became acquainted with the Boy in a dream. It was real, vivid, soaked in fear and rage, one of those dreams that you had to rip yourself from, stumbling back into a reality that was mercifully less real, cool air on scorched skin.

The Prince of Darkness lay dead and gutted on the cavern floor, stalagmites rising through the gaps in his ribs like glass fungi. The offspring had dug itself out of his rotting womb, leaving a neat cavernous crater for the Boy to nest in, fitting between crimson icicles and severed arteries.

Once the corpse turned cold, the boy thought of dragging himself over to the offspring that lay starved and half-dead in the corner, bloodbats already suckling on its skin. From lower down in the cave system, the call of some ancient behemoth reached him, inhuman, incomprehensible, a language so dense, so rich in intelligence that it crumpled my world in a matter of seconds - it was like having your head crushed between a door.

That was the first and last time I ever dreamed about him and Him, the late Prince of Darkness. In December of 2002, I saw them with my own eyes after slipping through the cracks from my college dorm in Providence to the literal underworld, cave system at the end of time and space. I’d already had enough reasons to hate the dormitory before this - old, grumpy wardens who only let you leave on the weekends, mess food that seemed to have been dreamed into existence by the imaginative power of soot-covered Victorian orphans, parasite-flavored water from frog-infested water coolers, having to drink and party in secrecy. It already felt like hell, and then I had to experience actual hell. It’s still debatable which one is which.

Shit hit the fan about a year after I had that dream. Dreams like that lingered in your head like snippets of deafening noise. It’s not like it consumed me from the inside or whatever like Interpol’s post-punk album did that year, but I remembered it occasionally and when I did, I tried my best to forget it. Plus, as a broke Engineering student, I had the luxury of being able to worry about a million other things.

I was walking back to the dorm after lazing in the open-air auditorium - it had been at least two hours since college had gotten over, but no one wanted to walk back into their sad excuses for rooms the moment college got over. We would sit, and talk, then the girls would sigh and say it was past curfew (curfew was at 5 - the girl’s dorm still lived in the primal, prehistoric fear of the sunset) and they would disappear into their dorms, and we would walk back to ours.

In 2002, I had about three friends and all three of them were from the college, hence my shockingly high attendance despite my complete detachment from academics. Let’s call them Aye, Bee, and Cece. Aye, Bee, and Cece had bright social lives outside of college and had little to no emotional investment in university but when they were stuck here for seven hours a day, or in the case of Aye, five days a week in the dorm, I was who they hung out with. Yet, this feeling of inferiority, of being the only one dependent on this friendship seeped like a bad smell into every interaction, every burst of laughter, every inside joke we shared. I even made efforts to make it seem like I had a colourful life outside of college so that they wouldn’t think I was a complete loser. Faked phone calls, refusing to hang out because I had a ‘prior commitment’ (i sat at home and listened to Radiohead and cooked Maggi), eluding questions about my life when any honest answer would come down to just me explaining the total lack of activity in it.

All this to say that there was always a disconnect between them and me. I always either tried too hard or didn’t try at all.

Aye and I were walking back to the dorms, which were located inside the campus itself, tucked away in the back like a corpse that needed hiding.

We were whining about the evening snacks, as we did routinely, and then every living inhabitant of the hostel dropped dead around us. A pigeon dropped onto the security guard’s lap, who himself was slumped backwards in his chair, eyes, mouth, elastic jowls hanging like curtains. The final image I carried as I flashed over to the caverns was the Pigeon’s round, glassy orb of an eye.

The Boy sat hunched in a corner, ripping and tearing chunks out of what we would find out later was the nine-month old offspring of the Prince of Darkness. Beside me, Aye was formless, devoid of any detail or colour, a vacuum - yet I knew it was him, could see him squinting through his square spectacles at the Prince’s bared skull. It was like staring through two different eyes at the exact same thing, two images, superimposed in the mind but separated in the eyes.

“What the fuck. What the fuck-”

Aye seemed to be trying to get a word out, but after one or two seconds of violent struggling, he simply reverted to ‘what the fuck’. The Boy turned to stare at us, the vertebrae in his back coiling so dangerously that I thought his back would shatter into a million pieces right there, and we’d have a third steaming, decomposing body to stare at. His mouth was coated with blood, meat, and strange worms that slipped between his lips even as he stared at us with wide, rheumy eyes as dead as those of the pigeon.

“…I can’t say your name. I’ve been trying to say it for the past minute… but I just can’t. I remember it, I can feel its outlines in my head, but…”

Aye’s rambling faded into the chemical confusion that flooded my brain.

The cave smelled like rot, felt like rot. The walls were awash in centuries of death, a geyser pool filling in souls torn to shreds, lives shackled to death before they were even born, unholy sacrifice.

From below, far below, something called out. Its voice shimmered and broke, like the world was too tiny, too cramped to fit even its whispers and with every syllable, a star died, a cosmic wall tore open. Something changed in my mind that day, beyond biochemistry, beyond everything one could call psychology. A crack had opened in my mind and the callousness of the universe seeped in like a feeble stream, flooding my skull, turning my blood to a sickly white. In the months that followed, the world hung before me like a dirty, anemic curtain, smothering me, suffocating me, and every so often, I felt the urge to tear through it all, knife slashing the cloth to threads all over God’s filthy linoleum floor. I finally did it, fucked the universe, in the garden, in the most beautiful place in the universe, that blurred polaroid of an image that God had stuck in the first monkey’s head and persisted in all it’s enticing ambiguity in our cellular memory - clear ponds, clear skies, chirping birds, butterflies phasing in and out of the sunshine like shades.

Me and Aye were standing in the ruins of the Prince - he was mammoth-sized, ribs curling in on our heads and striating what little strange light flowed in this world. When he rotted, he steamed, like everything else did in the Underworld.

I stepped through the gap in his ribs. Aye stood behind me, trembling.

“He says we need to protect him,” he said.

“Protect who?”

He pointed to the Boy, who was burrowing through the offspring’s stomach at the moment.

“Who said that?”

Aye said nothing. His eyes were a feral red, a wild matrix of veins slashed through white.

“This place wants to consume us. Devour us whole. A hundred million things are crawling their way toward us, and half of them are already here in our heads. Sprouting. Growing.”

Tendons snapped, bones cracked - the Boy’s fingernails steamed.

Aye jerked, life returning to his eyes. He stepped out of the corpse and tugged at my arm, then let go of it and ran to The Boy. His hands closed around his tiny body and then he was off, bolting through one of the exits. I followed them, their faint figures obscured by all the steam.

The sound of something being dragged against the ground echoed in my ears. Something rough. No matter how far I ran, the sound never stopped.

For a few minutes, we walked in true, absolute darkness. The only sensation I could feel was my feet against the cold, jagged floor and the sounds of Aye pattering ahead of me. My existence wavered and chipped away until I felt like I was nothing but an amalgamation of these three sensations - the coldness below me, the sound of footsteps like a pulsing heartbeat, and the dragging, the never-ending dragging.

Booming footsteps, so loud it drowned everything out and it felt like my soul would simply get snagged on it and carried away. In the swirling darkness of my head, I saw ghost mountains collapsing, oceans splitting and evaporating. The world quaked.

Aye’s hand shot out and grabbed my shirt. I tumbled into some sort of a pipe, sloping and wet and smelling like life. The booming continued, getting closer and closer to us, until it didn’t and it was like nothing was ever there and the horror dissolved into the darkness.

I wanted to say something, but the futility of it all pressed upon me, of making my useless little sounds while titans appeared and vanished into thin air. I felt like a germ. In the back of my mind, the grinding continued.

*KSSSSH. KSSSSH.*

What the fuck was he dragging?

Aye’s hand fell on me - I took hold of it and emerged from the pipe. The Boy hung from his shoulders like some emaciated, albino monkey. The air glowed a sick white, dust particles lighting up and dying, and I was able to see the cluster of pipes we’d hidden in, looking lesser and lesser like pipes the more I squinted at them. White, slimy, sinuous, like the esophagus of some big, dying beast.

I turned to face Aye - his eyes pale marbles, like The Boy, like the dead pigeon.

“We haven’t escaped them,” he whispered. His face looked like crumbling paper in the light.

*KSSSSH. KSSSSH.*

The pipes squelched, contorted. A gauntleted hand reached out, gripping its edges. The lights blinked out for a few seconds and all we heard was the clinking of chains, the rattling of metal. When the dust came alive again, he stood before us. His name was unsayable, for he was the Name, he was the Concept. We called him the Hunter, but he was more than that. He was the very idea of the Killer, the primordial force that strangled the light out of things, snuffed the life out of the living, the gift of existence out of the existing. He was Annihilation.

The dragging stopped. Whatever had wormed itself into my skull had decided to hide.

“We’ll never escape him,” Aye said, the words tumbling out of him like wind chimes stuck in a grave.

We blinked out of existence.

The sunlight was blinding - the afterimage of the Underworld still swam before my eyes, framing the buildings of the dormitories. The security guard was alive and well, flipping through the logbook with his fat hands. The pigeon was cleaning out its wings, nestled in the roof of the booth.

Aye and I walked to the lawn in front of the canteen and sat there for a few minutes.

*KSSSSH. KSSSSH.*

A ladybug crawled up a blade of grass, wings whirring like twin machines every now and then.

We never did escape him.
