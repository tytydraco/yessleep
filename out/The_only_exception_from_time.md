I owe a proper explanation. The latest wave has just passed, and I finally have a chance to summarize everything without any disturbances. [Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fdo8di/if_youre_able_to_read_this_then_time_should_have/), I was interrupted just before I could describe the introduction to the second stop. Unlike the [first stop](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fad9d5/time_for_me_has_never_behaved_the_way_others_have/), time froze while I was dozing on the couch, so I can't tell how long I slept for. The TV showed a still image of the last frame of the watch advert that I had seen before falling asleep and for a moment I thought that only the TV was broken, but when it didn't respond to my remote which got stuck in the air when I tried to throw it away, the situation became a little more obvious. I had to collect my thoughts for a bit to get everything on track. Since the events, I've always felt a bit strange, everything felt so detached, but that might be because I was going through a phase that was entirely different from the rest of my life and also completely unfamiliar.

When did I have to start persuading myself so much, that can't really be healthy, can it? But anyway, let's go back first. Alongside the feeling of detachment, a new one came along. I don't know much about psychological matters, but I would describe myself as a bit paranoid, especially after the strange whirlpool experience in the bathroom, the origin of which I actually found out -at least I have an idea-, but to not get everything all mixed up and out of order, I will explain that later. Nobody would benefit if I didn't describe the events chronologically. Anyway, after I became aware of my situation, I decided to prepare myself, because I could feel that something was eventually going to happen again. How right I was. Maybe I hadn't become so paranoid after all.

I couldn't run away anymore, I had to find a way to face it all and find out what the whole situation was about. The voice in my ear and the strange water tornado in my bathtub were surely just the beginning. What surprised me, however, was the fact that the two happened in different environments. Once during a stop and once in normal conditions.

Trembling slightly after getting up too fast, I went to the bedroom, pulled out the drawer of my nightstand and took out the pistol that my dad had given me for my 21st birthday. If something serious really did happen, at least I now had a weapon. I had never intended to use it. Did I even know how to use it? Clumsily and with a little too much caution, I pushed the magazine in, released the safety and raised it in my right hand. The pistol pulled my hand down like a dumbbell, but after a while I managed to hold it still and aim at the bullseye of my dartboard. I only rarely played darts, I guess there was never a big enough reason for me to go through the hassle of storing it elsewhere. Since time was frozen, I was unsure as to what would happen if I shot a bullet, unsure if the pistol would even work properly. But only one way to find out.

The bang was louder than I had expected, and I flinched briefly as my finger pulled the trigger. With a high-pitched sound in my ears, I examined the result of my experiment and lo and behold, the bullet was motionless in the air, just a few inches in front of the weapon. When I got closer and reached out my hand for it, the small piece of metal continued on its way, shooting forward in the same direction, exactly as far away as before. Admittedly, the gun wasn't much use to me, but even if I could only shoot about a hand's length forward; if I really needed it, just for the feeling of safety that it emitted. It felt reassuring as I put the holster on around my right thigh and casually slid it in.

What else could I use? I strolled around the apartment for a while; the holster gave me a western charm, or at least that's what I wanted. Dad always had an eye for cool stuff and used to really be into cowboy outfits. I definitely hated being seen with him when I was in my teenage years, always thought that his hat and boots were too much and embarrassing, but the longer I felt the leather holster on my thigh with the gun trying to pull it down, I started to realize why dad chose his wardrobe the way he did. Finally, my eyes fell on the collection of knives in the kitchen; yes, one of those would most likely prove more useful than the pistol in an emergency situation, whatever that may be. Armed as never before, my next task was to learn as much as I could about the precise rules of a time freeze before the next problematic situation would rear its ugly head.

My first question; which vehicles could I use? The dark blue bicycle leaning against the wall of my apartment complex was already beaming at me as I tried to let the door to the entrance fall closed, but then noticed that it wasn’t moving and locked it securely. Contrary to the door, I never locked my bike, after all it was probably older than me. Acquired as a gift from my grandfather, I promised myself to would it until I could give it to my own grandchildren. The familiar groaning and moaning of the frame rang out beautifully as I threw all my weight onto it and pedaled. The chain rubbed like crazy. Well, I couldn't remember the last time I'd lubricated it.

So, bikes worked perfectly. What about cars? It took longer than I thought to find out which car was best fit for this, after all I didn't own one. If I could actually drive a car during a timefreeze, I couldn't just use the next best one I found, because it would start moving again as soon as I touched it, which would immediately lead to a crash because of the heavy state of traffic. I had to find one that was currently open, preferably in a parking lot, but that didn't have anyone sitting in it.

The next route took me to the nearest supermarket, the unsteady surface of the pedals digging into the soles of my shoes that were driving the old steel horse to peak performance. My journey shouldn’t have taken more than 10 minutes, but I had no way of measuring my speed. This time my route didn't go along the bike path, no, if no one was able to drive, then I had to take advantage of it. I continued on past cars on the right and left, through a pedestrian passage and right next to police officers, a little more joy on my face with every pedal stroke. Rarely had I felt so free. Detached from the invisible limitations of everyday life, I stormed through the city, not giving anything a second glance. I was inattentive but didn't care in that moment. I could finally feel like a child again without a single worry in the world, at least for a bit.

The doors of the supermarket were wide open when I finally reached the parking lot in front of it. A small man with circular hair loss and a ball-shaped gut that must have shifted his center of gravity unhealthily far forward and pushed the buttons of his checked shirt to their limits, was just leaving the supermarket with a truckload of beer crates, car keys already drawn and in his hand. The old, rusty Fiat, whose lights were frozen while blinking, must belong to him. I stopped about half a meter in front of the man with screeching brakes, when I realized something.

I had no idea what would happen if I approached people. Carefully, as if I were trying not to wake a sleeping predator, I approached his hand, the key in my focus. He remained rigid as I reached for the key, slowly and carefully taking it from his sausage-like fingers until he made a noise. Slowly and endlessly drawn out, a groan of agony escaped his throat and his pupils darted in my direction. Forced into a state of shock, I could do nothing but maintain eye contact, still gripping the key just above his hand. As with my first experience, a sickening feeling of panic crept down my entire body, and I soon was nothing more than a lump of pure misery.

" You broke the rules "

crawled out of the man's hoarse throat, his voice impossibly deep.

" Agaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnn "

That sound made my chest shiver, the small movements catching on throughout my arms and legs getting stronger and stronger with every passing second. The tone went on for an eternity, echoing back and forth between my ears as if there was nothing in between, no brain in my head. The sound waves bounced off the plates of my skull, faster and faster, compressed by their speed, until everything merged into a single sound that vibrated loudly through my entire being and prevented me from thinking. I was in danger of breaking apart if this torment continued in my ears for much longer. At some point, the shaking became so strong that my legs could no longer support my weight and dropped me the ground, the key leaving my hand and falling next to me. The man, however, did not fall, quite the opposite.

Only centimeters from my feet, he lifted his leg, slowly stretching it out, the joints and tendons pulled, ached and cracked under the strain. The stretching never ended, even when the ligaments snapped, a sickening sound sweeping through the otherwise dead silent parking lot, followed by a loud "POP" that dislodged the kneecap. Leg now fully extended, the shoe aimed at my unprotected head as I laid there on the concrete, still unable to move from the shaking. The first kick almost knocked me unconscious, but still left me able to watch as the leg was prepared again, this time in the other direction. Pulling the knee back agonizingly slowly, as if preparing to kick a ball, the little man, or whatever was holding him in its grip, swung wide, again so wide that I could hear something ripping. Without any form of mercy, the leg finally shot forward, with an inhuman speed and force that would soon hit my head again. Still shaking, I closed my eyes, the all-consuming, agonizing sound in my head would be the last thing I would ever hear. My last survival instincts were to pull my arms up and hope that this would not be the end of me.

The kick was strong enough to send me halfway across the parking lot, luckily for me and knocked out harder than everything lese I’ve ever experienced. At this point, I think it's understandable that I'm no longer trying to estimate how long I've been unconscious. My eyes only saw red for a moment before I managed to blink and filter out the blood that was dripping from the gaping wound on my forehead. My neck burned as my head had apparently hit the small wooden rain cover for the shopping carts, pressing my chin into my chest. Groaning loudly, I rolled onto my side to relieve the pressure on my neck as my gaze caught his again. Petrified in mid-motion, the man's leg was still at chest height, he must have frozen again when the kick sent me flying and left him out of my reach. Even though I was already several feet away on the ground, I could still see his massively dilated pupils. They were staring into my eyes as I fainted again in my attempt to get up.

The second awakening was accompanied by a stream of vomit, my stomach was practically wringing itself out when I came to, knife and gun lying useless next to me. This time I managed to hoist my body up shortly afterwards, as a little more orange stomach mass kissed the floor. The man was gone, vanished without a trace, as if he had never been there. The key lay motionless next to the shopping cart, I had to get to it. The wound on my forehead throbbed even more than the spots on my right shoulder and chin where the second kick had hit me.

Somehow, I seemed to have managed to protect my head from it to a large extent. I used all my remaining strength to crawl towards the key, pick up the heavy piece of metal covered in ribbons and tags and put it in the keyhole of the old junk car. As soon as I could open the trunk, I also had access to bandages, which after what felt like an eternity, I had finally wrapped well enough around my wounds to feel cared for. With the seats reclined and my body stretched out on them, I could only hope that this time freeze would last long enough to avoid having to explain why I had broken into someone else's car.

Still feeling under the weather, but at least a little recovered, I later made my first attempt to start the car, but to no avail. The ignition turned and the battery started, but every attempt to wake up the engine immediately stalled. Wow, I went through all that, only to fail afterwards. Analyzing exactly why it didn't work came later; first I needed medication. I had that at home. Swearing loudly, but feeling more stable on my feet, I climbed out of the driver's door, slamming it so hard that I briefly thought the little Fiat would fall apart. But unfortunately, it didn't. Without any trust in myself to ride a bike, I was forced to push it home, gun and knife in the basket. The journey was torture, full of pain and threatening overexertion. I don't know how much my consciousness suffered as a result, but in my memory the same thing was written on every single sign. Not only the signs, but the displays for fuel prices, advertisements and stickers on the poles next to the road all had the same inscription.

"You broke the rules."

Time began to flow normally again when I was within sight of my apartment. Once again, I was met with astonished looks, this time probably because of the bandages that wrapped around my head like a strange combination of turban and ski mask. Maybe also because I was leaning on my bike as if my life depended on it, with weapons in my basket, and in a state that no one would classify as healthy or stable. Finally, back at the apartment, I opened the cupboard in the bathroom and grabbed whatever I could find first. Painkillers.

After these worked their magic and a load of disinfectant and new bandages, I was able to think a little easier. A nap later, the digital clock on my oven told me that not even half the day was over. The TV was still lit by the clock advert. Apparently it was one of those internet ads that didn't automatically play the next video when it ended. I pressed the big button in the middle of the remote and started the next video, a commentary video about some new tech gadget that would be forgotten in two days anyway.

The next time freeze occurred about four hours later and not too long after that I wrote my second post, which was a lot shorter than I had intended. I'll explain why exactly, but before that I'd like to give a few explanations about the past phenomena, at least the explanations that I was able to piece together myself. Whatever happens during the paused time is controlled by something.

This entity, let's call it "Sam" for the sake of clarity, has most of the control over the laws during this phase, except for me. I don't yet understand why it doesn't like my exception, but I now understand how it can control other people. If they are close enough to be included into my exception, as in my supermarket incident, then Sam has full control, otherwise it can only "turn them back", i.e., make them repeat all the activities that happened before but in reverse. Standing still and observing is, of course, an option as well. I suspect that Sam has no regular sense of time, unlike me, because I always feel time passing at the same speed, even when everything else has stopped.

I believe that Sam has a kind of sleep cycle, when he wakes up, time freezes and vice versa, but I only have a vague idea about the water tornado and why it happened outside of the petrified time state. Either I imagined it all - pretty unlikely - or Sam managed to reverse the flow of the water during normal time, which was arguing with the normal laws of physics and thus formed the vortex back into the water pipe. I like to call the oscillating states of time Sam’s sleep rhythm. Perhaps that's not a completely wrong idea and I could also say that it loses strength during his sleep phases, which would combine some of my theories. This concludes my relatively uncertain explanation for why only the water was manipulated. What would have happened if I had thrown myself into the tornado remains a mystery to me, but after the rather less than pleasant confrontations with Sam, I assume that it would not have ended very comfortably.

The noises that interrupted my previous message was Sam as well, this time trying to get as close to my apartment as possible. It used my neighbor, whom I had previously encountered outside my apartment door, and forced him back to that very location. It wanted to ambush me there, but I fled via the fire escape ladder, up to the roof, where I ended up staying until the next normalization and have been writing this message ever since.

I need to know more about all this, so I have developed a plan to communicate with Sam. Admittedly, this plan is based on a lot of assumptions and hopes, but continuing to go along with the situation is no longer an option. My plan is based on the main assumption that I drew Sam's attention to me by making loud noises, like the gunshot. The rules during a time stop were set, and it didn't like them being broken, as it clearly stated. So, I need to prepare a "trap" in which I place a frozen person who I can get close enough to, to exclude them from the rules without being endangered. But the person also needs to be protected from themselves. I would never voluntarily watch someone being crippled by Sam and therefore technically by themselves again.

 

How exactly I do this remains to be seen, but it is time to face the situation, I can't live through this without any action anymore. To be honest, I haven't been able to process any of the weird events and honestly don't know if it's even possible. It's hard to put into words how it feels when you're simply isolated from the rest of the world and at the same time everything is in order in a certain way. I feel out of place every time I stop, and the feeling gnaws at me, it makes me doubt. Doubt whether everything even exists, whether I'm dreaming all this or if I'm really just hallucinating. My head has always been able to perceive time differently, perhaps it could also interpret reality differently. What if time doesn't stand still at all, if everything is actually happening normally and I'm the only one who perceives everything wrong. For now, I've been able to put the fight against my own head into the background, and hopefully it will stay that way for a while.

 

I have to find an answer soon, and I'll keep looking until I find it, regardless of what it’s going to turn out to be.
