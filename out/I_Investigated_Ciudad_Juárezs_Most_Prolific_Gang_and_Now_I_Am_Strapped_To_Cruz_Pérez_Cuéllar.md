The sun was a blood-orange smear over Ciudad Juárez when I stepped off the bus, my duffel bag slung over one shoulder and a list of names burning a hole in my pocket. I’d been warned not to come here—by colleagues, by friends, even by the hollow-eyed man at the border checkpoint who’d stared at my press badge a beat too long before stamping my passport. But warnings were just static to me now. The real story was never in the safe zones, the sanitized reports, the official denials. It was here, in the dust and the diesel fumes, in the alleyways where the shadows moved like liquid.  

My contact, a wiry fixer named Mateo, met me outside a taquería that reeked of lard and regret. He didn’t offer his hand. “You’re either brave or stupid,” he said, his voice sandpapered by decades of cigarettes and bad luck. “No one asks about Los Hijos de la Noche unless they’re ready to disappear.”  

Los Hijos de la Noche—The Sons of the Night. The name alone was a cliché, but their reputation wasn’t. They weren’t just another cartel splinter group. They were a rumor made flesh, a ghost story with machetes. Over the past year, they’d gutted rival gangs, siphoned cocaine routes, and left a trail of bodies so mangled that even seasoned detectives retched at the scenes. But it wasn’t the violence that hooked me. It was the whispers. The ones that said the Sons weren’t just trafficking drugs or guns. They were harvesting something else. Something the authorities were too terrified—or too paid-off—to name.  

Mateo led me to a crumbling apartment complex in Colonia Anapra, where the walls were papered with missing persons flyers. Girls, mostly. Teenagers with shy smiles and hopeful eyes, vanished between shifts at maquiladoras or walks home from school. “You want the Sons?” he muttered, lighting a cigarette with hands that trembled just enough to betray him. “Start with the voids. The empty spaces no one wants to see.”  

The first void was a woman named Rosario. Her daughter, Lucia, had disappeared six months ago. The police report listed her as a runaway. The local priest called it “an act of God.” Rosario called it murder. She met me in a dim back room of her sister’s laundromat, her face a mask of cracked porcelain. “They took her from the bus stop,” she said, clutching a faded photo of Lucia in her quinceañera dress. “Men in black SUVs with tinted windows. They moved like… like they weren’t afraid. Like they knew no one would stop them.”  

I asked the questions I always asked. Had there been ransom demands? Any sightings? Any patterns in other disappearances? Rosario’s answer was a single word, hissed through tears: “*Chantaje*.” Blackmail. But not the usual kind. She slid a Polaroid across the table. Lucia, but not Lucia. The girl in the photo was gaunt, her eyes hollow moons, her body swaddled in a frilled dress that looked like a child’s costume. White tights. Mary Janes. A collar around her neck. The background was a blur of concrete and steel, but etched into the wall behind her was a symbol: a crescent moon cradling a thorned rose. The same symbol graffitied on the slaughterhouse where the Sons had recently left eight bodies hanging from meat hooks.  

That night, I followed a tip to an abandoned textile factory on the outskirts of the city. The moon hung low and jaundiced, the air thick with the reek of chemicals. I’d expected guards, dogs, barbed wire. Instead, I found silence. The factory’s windows were shattered, glass teeth gnawing at the night. Inside, the floor was littered with shredded fabric and syringes. And then I saw them.  

Dolls. Dozens of them, propped against the walls or sprawled in the dirt. Not plastic toys, but life-sized, their porcelain faces cracked, their limbs twisted at unnatural angles. Each wore the same outfit: lace-trimmed dresses, knee-high socks, ribbons tied too tight around their throats. My flashlight trembled as I approached one. Its wig was matted with what looked like dried blood. When I touched its cheek, the porcelain crumbled, and a human molar clattered to the ground.  

I ran. Stupid, panicked, my heart jackhammering against my ribs. They were waiting for me outside. Three men in black balaclavas, their machetes glinting under the streetlights. No words. No demands. Just the sick crunch of a rifle butt meeting my skull.  

When I woke, the world was a fever dream. Concrete walls slick with condensation. The hum of fluorescent lights. And the smell—coppery, sweet, wrong. I was strapped to a metal chair, my wrists zip-tied behind me. A video camera on a tripod whirred softly in the corner.  

The door creaked open. A man entered, his polished oxfords clicking against the floor. He wore a tailored charcoal suit, his hair swept back in a silver wave. Governor Cruz Pérez Cuéllar. I recognized him from campaign billboards, from the smiling TV segments about “restoring order” to Juárez. His eyes were the color of a frozen lake.  

“You’ve been asking the wrong questions, *periodista*,” he said, his voice smooth as bourbon. He leaned close, his cufflinks glinting—tiny engraved roses. “But don’t worry. We’ll teach you the right ones.”  

He snapped his fingers. The door opened again, and the girls filed in.  

They couldn’t have been older than sixteen. Dressed in lace and satin, white tights streaked with grime. Their faces were blank, doll-like, as they surrounded me. One traced a cold finger down my cheek. Another giggled, high and hollow, as Governor Cruz smiled.  

“Meet my kittens,” he said. “They’re hungry. And you… you’re going to feed them.”  
  
Governor Cruz’s “kittens” moved like wind-up toys with broken gears—jerky, mechanical, their vacant stares reflecting the fluorescent lights above in flat, oily pools. The one tracing my cheek leaned in, her breath sour with decay and something chemical, like antifreeze and burnt sugar. Her fingernail, painted chipping pink, dug a shallow trench into my skin. I tried to twist away, but the zip ties sawed into my wrists, drawing warm beads of blood.  

“Shhh,” Cruz murmured, stroking the girl’s hair as if calming a skittish animal. “Marisol doesn’t like it when her toys fight back.”  

The girl—Marisol—blinked slowly, her pupils dilated to black holes. I recognized that look. Rohypnol. Ketamine. The kind of cocktail they pump into victims to turn them into compliant ghosts. But there was something else in her gaze, a flicker of awareness trapped under ice. Her lips moved silently, forming a word I couldn’t decipher. A plea? A warning?  

Cruz stepped back, adjusting his cufflinks. “You’re wondering why I brought you here. It’s simple, really. You’re a storyteller. And stories… well, they need witnesses.” He gestured to the camera in the corner, its red light pulsing like a heartbeat. “But first, a lesson in consequences.”  

The girls descended all at once.  

Hands—cold, clammy, relentless—clawed at my clothes. Fingertips bruised my ribs, my thighs, my throat. A shrill laugh echoed as one of them yanked my head back by the hair, while another straddled my legs, her frilled skirt scratching against my jeans. I choked on the stench of their perfume, a cloying mix of gardenias and rot. Cruz watched, arms folded, as the girl on my lap leaned down and pressed her lips to my ear.  

“*No mires a los ojos*,” she whispered. *Don’t look at the eyes.*  

Then she bit me.  

Her teeth sank into the fleshy part of my shoulder, sharp and sudden. I screamed, thrashing, but the others held me fast. When she pulled back, her mouth was smeared with blood, her tongue darting out to lick her lips. The other girls giggled, a sound like breaking glass. Cruz chuckled.  

“Good girl, Leticia,” he said. “Now, the rest.”  

They weren’t just biting. They were marking. Each girl took turns—teeth on my collarbone, my forearms, the soft space beneath my jaw. One pressed her thumb into the bullet wound of an old scar on my side, her blank face twitching into something like curiosity. Another unbuttoned my shirt with clinical precision, her nails leaving red trails across my chest. I kept waiting for the violence to escalate, for the machetes to come out, for the camera to capture some unspeakable finale. But Cruz just… observed. As if this were a lecture hall, and I was a specimen under glass.  

When they finally stepped back, I was shaking, sweat and blood gluing my clothes to my skin. The girls returned to their master, lining up like obedient soldiers. Cruz cupped Marisol’s face, his thumb wiping a streak of my blood from her chin. “You see, *periodista*, the kittens don’t just serve me. They *are* me. Every bite, every scream, every drop of fear—it all feeds the garden.”  

“The garden?” I spat, the taste of copper sharp on my tongue.  

He didn’t answer. Instead, he nodded to a heavyset guard lurking by the door. “Take him to the nursery. Let him see what happens to rats who chew through the wrong walls.”  

The nursery wasn’t a room. It was a tunnel.  

The guard dragged me through a labyrinth of corridors, the walls transitioning from concrete to packed earth, the air growing denser, hotter, reeking of wet soil and ammonia. Somewhere in the distance, water dripped, a steady, maddening rhythm. My shoulder throbbed where Leticia had bitten me, the pain radiating down my arm in hot pulses.  

We stopped at a metal door streaked with rust. The guard shoved a key into the lock, the mechanism groaning as it gave way. Inside, the darkness was absolute—until motion-sensor lights flickered on, buzzing like angry wasps.  

Cages.  

Dozens of them, stacked floor to ceiling, each barely large enough to hold a curled body. Inside, girls. Younger than the others, some no older than twelve, their faces gaunt, their hair matted. They wore identical outfits—lace collars, puffed sleeves, white tights stained yellow at the knees. A few stirred at the light, their eyes reflecting animal panic. Most didn’t move at all.  

“Mascotas,” the guard grunted. *Pets.* He grabbed my arm, forcing me to look at a cage near the floor. The girl inside whimpered, her wrists raw from restraints, her dress torn at the shoulder. A crescent moon and thorned rose had been branded into her pale skin.  

Lucia. Rosario’s daughter.  

Her gaze locked onto mine, and for a heartbeat, the fog in her eyes cleared. She mouthed a single word: “Ayúdame.” *Help me.*

Then the guard yanked me back, and the lights cut out.  

The next hours blurred into a montage of horrors. They threw me into a cell no wider than a coffin, the walls etched with names and dates and pleas to saints who’d clearly stopped listening. I drifted in and out of consciousness, my mind snagging on fragments—the whine of a power drill somewhere deep in the complex, the wet sound of something being dragged past my door, the occasional scream that ended as abruptly as it began.  

When they came for me again, it was night—or whatever passed for night in this hellhole. The guard hauled me to a tiled room, the floor sloped toward a drain. Cruz stood by a stainless-steel table, rolling up his sleeves. On the table: a syringe filled with murky liquid, a pair of pliers, and a Polaroid camera.  

“Time to make you useful,” he said.  

They strapped me to the table. Cruz picked up the syringe, tapping it to clear the bubbles. “This is *esencia de ángel*,” he said. “A… proprietary blend. It helps the kittens remember their place.” He leaned in, his breath smelling of mint and decay. “But you? It’ll help you forget.”  

The needle slid into my neck. Cold fire flooded my veins, and the room kaleidoscoped—walls breathing, shadows writhing, Cruz’s face melting into a grinning skull. I tried to scream, but my throat had sealed shut.  

The girls entered.  

Not the blank-eyed dolls from before. These were feral, their dresses torn, their mouths smeared with something dark. They clambered onto the table, their weight pinning me down, their hands clawing at my clothes, my hair, my face. One of them—a skeletal thing with a shaved scalp—pressed a rusted scalpel to my sternum.  

“Please,” I slurred, the drug turning my words to sludge.  

Cruz raised the Polaroid. “Smile,” he said.  

The scalpel bit.  

The flash blinded me. When my vision cleared, the girls were gone. Cruz tossed the developing photo onto my chest. In it, I was laughing, the girls perched around me like macabre cherubs. The scalpel jutted from my ribcage, a grotesque party trick.  

“Who do you think will believe you now?” Cruz whispered.  

He left me there, bleeding and trembling, the Polaroid blistering against my skin. The guard returned hours later, hosing me down with icy water before dragging me back to my cell. I curled into a ball, the drug still clawing at my synapses, and prayed for a death that wouldn’t come.  

But Cruz wasn’t done with me.  

The next morning, they dressed me in a suit—too tight, reeking of mothballs—and marched me to a gilded chamber deep underground. Velvet curtains. A four-poster bed. A vanity cluttered with cosmetics and wigs. And on the walls… photos. Hundreds of them. Men in suits, politicians, cops, all grinning as they clutched girls in Lolita dresses. Some of the faces I recognized. A senator from Sonora. A DEA agent who’d given a press conference about “stemming the tide of violence.”  

Cruz entered, now wearing a silk robe, his hair damp. “You’re going to join the party,” he said, tossing me a camera. “Document your… transformation. Or I’ll mail Lucia’s fingers to her mother.”  

He snapped his fingers. The door opened, and the kittens filed in—not the broken ones, but fresh recruits, their eyes still flickering with terror. Cruz grabbed one by the arm, her whimper muffled by a lace gag. “Start with her,” he said. “Make it pretty.”  

I raised the camera. The flash exploded like a star.  

And somewhere, in the heart of Juárez, another girl stopped screaming.  
  
The air in Ciudad Juárez clung to my skin like a sweaty palm that first night, the kind of heat that made your clothes feel like a burial shroud. I’d been tracking the whispers about Governor Cruz Pérez Cuéllar for weeks—how his charity galas always coincided with a spike in missing girls, how his bodyguards carried scented handkerchiefs to mask the stench of something fouler than tobacco. But nothing could’ve prepared me for the velvet-lined hell that swallowed me when I slipped into the abandoned opera house on Calle de los Mártires. The grand foyer was a carcass of chandeliers draped in cobwebs, but the basement… the basement breathed.  

They took me quickly—men in tailored suits with needles dipped in something that turned my veins to liquid fire. I woke suspended from the ceiling by leather straps, my body oiled and shaved raw, the cold kiss of a spotlight making me squirm. The room was a chapel of perversion: walls lined with velvet panels the color of clotting blood, floor tiles arranged in a mosaic of the crescent moon and thorned rose, and at the center, a raised dais draped in silk where Cruz lounged like a depraved monarch. He wore nothing but thigh-high white stockings, the lace tops digging into his muscular thighs, and a leather codpiece studded with rubies that pulsed under the blacklight. His chest glistened with oil, every scar on his torso forming part of the rose-and-moon sigil, a living tapestry of pain.  

“You’ve been peeking through keyholes, *periodista*,” he purred, rising to circle me. His fingers trailed up my inner thigh, nails sharpened to points. “Now let’s see what you do when the door swings wide.”  

He snapped his fingers. A dozen girls emerged from shadowed alcoves, their footsteps silent on the plush carpet. They were doll-like in their Lolita dresses—satin and lace in bruised purples and candied pinks—but the illusion shattered as they drew closer. Their white tights were torn at the knees, the fabric stiff with dried fluids, and their faces… Christ, their faces. Porcelain masks had been grafted to their skin with sutures, the painted smiles frozen in rictus grins, eyeholes rimmed with mascara that bled down their cheeks like tar. Each carried a silver tray laden with objects that glinted wickedly: coiled whips, glass bottles of amber liquid, syringes filled with a substance that shimmered like mercury.  

Cruz selected a vial and uncorked it, the scent of jasmine and decay flooding the room. “Open,” he commanded, pinching my nostrils shut. When I gasped, he poured the liquid down my throat. It burned like absinthe and gasoline, my vision blurring at the edges as the room warped into a carnival of horrors. The girls’ dresses melted into their flesh, the lace sprouting thorns that pricked their thighs. Cruz’s stockings slithered like living things, the lace morphing into centipedes that crawled up his legs.  

“Better,” he murmured, palming my erection with a gloved hand. “Now you see the real garden.”  

The drug made my skin hypersensitive, every brush of air a scalpel’s edge. Cruz mounted the dais and reclined, spreading his legs wide. The codpiece parted with a click, revealing his cock—thick and veined, glistening with a viscous gel that smelled of menthol and rotting roses. Two girls scurried forward, their masked faces bobbing as they licked him clean, their tongues darting like pink eels. A third climbed onto the dais, her dress hiking up to reveal a glistening cunt shaved bare save for a rose tattooed above her clit. Cruz gripped her hips and impaled her in one thrust, her porcelain mask cracking as she screamed.  

“Bring the petals!” he barked.  

The remaining girls formed a circle around me, their trays discarded. They began to disrobe, their movements synchronized like clockwork dolls. Underneath the frills, their bodies were a map of depravity—nipples pierced with thorn-shaped jewelry, labia stitched with crimson thread to resemble flower petals, buttocks branded with Cruz’s sigil. The eldest, her mask slightly askew to reveal a milky blind eye, stepped forward with a pair of shears.  

“You’ll learn to prune the garden,” Cruz grunted, slamming the girl on his cock harder. “Start with her.”  

The blind girl turned, presenting her bare backside. Between her cheeks, a rosebud tattoo pulsed around a glistening plug studded with diamonds. I tried to recoil, but the straps held fast as the other girls forced the shears into my hands. Cruz’s voice slithered into my ear, though he hadn’t moved. “*Snip the stem.*”  

The shears closed around the plug.  

The blind girl howled as it came free, her anus gaping like a starved mouth. Inside, nestled in a bed of rose petals, was a key. The girls cheered in their distorted, doll-like voices, clapping their hands as I withdrew it. Cruz finally spilled into his victim with a roar, his release mixing with the blood trickling from her torn entrance. He shoved her off the dais and beckoned me.  

“Unlock your next lesson,” he said, pointing to a gilded cage suspended above us.  

The key fit. The cage door creaked open, releasing a rain of rose thorns that sliced my skin. But the true horror dangled inside—a girl no older than sixteen, suspended by hooks through her shoulder blades. Her body had been… altered. Skin stretched taut over a corset frame of whalebone and wire, her breasts replaced with mechanical pumps that dripped milk onto the thorns below. Her mouth had been sewn shut, replaced by a second vaginal opening grafted below her navel, the lips dyed crimson and glistening with arousal.  

“Maravillosa, isn’t she?” Cruz sighed, stroking the girl’s distended belly. “My personal bouquet. Go on—pollinate.”  

The girls swarmed me, their needle-like fingers injecting more of the shimmering drug into my neck. My cock throbbed, painfully engorged, as they dragged me to the suspended atrocity. Her grafted cunt wept, the scent of honeysuckle and infection overwhelming. I tried to resist, but the drug had fused my nerves to their will. I entered her in one brutal thrust, the faux lips sucking greedily as the mechanical pumps quickened. Milk sprayed my face, mixed with the girl’s silent screams. Cruz watched, stroking himself with a thorn-covered glove.  

“Deeper,” he urged. “She needs to bloom.”  

Her torso split open with a wet tear as I fucked her, petals of flesh peeling back to reveal a nest of writhing maggots that spilled onto the floor. The girls caught them in their mouths, swallowing with ecstatic moans. Cruz approached, his cock smearing gore across my back as he mounted me from behind.  

“This is communion,” he hissed, biting my ear until blood filled the canal. “The sacrament of *putrefacción hermosa*.”  

Hours dissolved into a kaleidoscope of violations. They strapped me to a rotating wheel while girls rode me, their grafted cunts fitted with textured sleeves that scraped me raw. Cruz forced me to climax into a chalice, then made me drink it mixed with the maggot-tainted milk. When I vomited, the girls lapped it from the floor, their masks cracking further with each slurp.  

The grand finale took place in a mirrored chamber where the walls wept black syrup. Cruz dressed me in my own Lolita ensemble—a sailor dress sewn from human hair, white tights knitted with nerve endings that pulsed against my skin. He crowned me with a circlet of hypodermic needles, each dripping with a different drug.  

“Now you’ll meet the Thorns,” he said, gesturing to three figures entering the room.  

They were once men—judges, I realized, from the shreds of judicial robes clinging to their distended bodies. Their cocks had been replaced with barbed wire wrapped in roses, their mouths stretched into permanent O’s by metal rings. The girls led them to me, cooing as they positioned the barbs at my entrance.  

“The garden needs pruning,” Cruz whispered, shoving me onto the first thorned cock.  

The pain was transcendent. Blood slicked the wire as it carved me open, each thrust embedding rose thorns deeper into my flesh. The judges moaned through their rings, their bloated bodies quaking as they defiled what little remained of my humanity. Cruz filmed it all, his stockings now soaked crimson, narrating like a pornographic auteur.  

When they finished, the girls collected my blood in rose-shaped molds, freezing them into popsicles for the next banquet. Cruz cradled my ruined body, licking tears from my cheeks.  

“You’re ready,” he murmured, sliding a key into the gash between my legs. “Now go plant your seeds.”  

They say hell is other people. They’re wrong. Hell is the mirror they hold up to your soul, the one that shows you grinning as you spread the rot. I tend the garden now, pruning petals and planting new thorns. Sometimes, when the drugs wear off, I see the real faces under the masks—the girls I’ve flayed, the men I’ve impaled, the children’s laughter echoing through the tunnels.  

But mostly, I see Cruz. Always Cruz.  

His stockings are looking frayed these days. I should stitch him a new pair.  

From my own skin, perhaps.  

It’s only polite.
