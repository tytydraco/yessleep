  I’ve been told that people often use this forum to create threads seeking advice on more peculiarly-mannered things on the internet. Though I don’t believe my case to be unheard of, I have nobody to turn to right now to speak about my troubles for my current circumstances following the day Bosnia disappeared. I will state now that I’m not looking for money or an opportunity to commiserate but my wife and two daughters whom I lost over three decades ago. I would post this question in such a thread in the dedicated Bosnian forum here, but my post was removed due to my account being too new.



  I’m addressing the first part of this post to fellow countrymen in the Yugoslav Confederation though I will provide additional context to my whole situation after.

  
  This is to any other fellow countrymen or Croats in the new Croatian Sarajevo Administrative Zone (CSA) within Yugoslavia. I am and have been looking for my wife – a Bosnian national before its collapse. I last saw her near the outbreak of the Yugoslav War of Reunification in 1991 where she had last been occupied as a housewife with our two daughters. I have been a Bosnian expatriate of sorts in the USSR for the last 33 years and am looking for any sign of my family.   
  
  My wife should be 65 this year, come November, my daughters whom I’ll call A and S are ones with dark brown straight hair. If anyone has heard anything about them, I really need to know their whereabouts.



  Here’s some context about my situation.



  When the sovereign Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1992, I had been working as a businessman who often went on trips overseas on behalf of Energoinvest. We had business in Hanoi, Vietnam with one of their engineering firms then. I was assigned to participate in one of our conferences in their city in November of that year. It’s been a long time but you can believe me on the specifics here, I still remember the gate and flight numbers on my ticket when I go to sleep at night now. 



  This had been the first time flying out that far from home though I did fly frequently enough as part of my job. My kids used to joke with me that my work was just a happy excuse for me to travel and see the world. And I used to joke back that they needed to study hard so they would be able to earn more than I did then when they grew up so they could take me to see actually nice places like America.   
  
  We really weren’t poor despite my needing to be away from family for extended periods of time. We were quite fortunate compared to other families we were familiar with then. I was especially fortunate to have landed the job I had in the company and took the position. The pay was good, and my wife wasn’t working then; we had two kids.



  Here, we have a saying that follows how a child with long fingers got them for school or the piano. Neither my wife nor I had particularly long fingers, but both my girls had them. A is my older daughter, she liked to read American Books like Catcher in the Rye and of Mice and Men. I still remember that when I got the second book for her for her tenth birthday, that she had read it over a dozen times or so before I got the chance to get her another book. I think my wife and I knew that for them, we had to make sure they were given everything they needed to pursue finer vocations. I hated the idea that they would be sent to the city’s polytechnic and schools to be streamlined into field jobs for men and baser workers like myself. 



  I say now that I really regret my decision now to have accepted that position those years back though I still hope both my daughters have a good life now. Still, I justified to myself that it was a sacrifice I had to make for my girls then. The former is truer now after what happened that year.



  I prided myself then as a prepared man – a proper man. It was probably just a product of my accustomed to the cycles of my occupation then but believe me when I say I never spared any preparation when it came to travel overseas. I always did bring with me a spare copy of travel documents, arrive four hours before my time of departure in the airport and do research on the laws regarding travel in my flights’ final destinations and the countries I’d land in for connecting flights. The path was standard, around half-a-day long with a layover in Kazakh SSR’s Almaty International in the transit both ways between Sarajevo and Hanoi. 



  The conference had gone fine. It was in no small part perfunctory with most major decisions having been made before it had even commenced by the higher ups. Good drink – their tea was delicious – and good food but insufferable weather. I was happy to be flying home once my business there had run dry. My VISA I had applied for was set to expire just two days after my last day in the country anyways. By then, I’d spent around two weeks in Hanoi – one of the longer trips I’d gone on – and it was on the ninth of November that year that I flew back.



  Most of you reading this with some knowledge about your history already know where this is going. My case isn’t an isolated one, nor is it one that is particularly unheard of, especially following the implementation of Glasnost in the late 2010s. The point is that the day I flew back from Vietnam was the day the Belgrade Treaty was co-signed by the former Federated Yugoslavian states of Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia for a joint reunification effort to be enforced with the partition and absorption of Bosnia into the new western-aligned Yugoslav Confederation. You already know about the Seven Hour March just like how you already know about the last battle fought for the defence of Sarajevo being fought by the Bosnian army in foreign soil, cloistered away from their homelands. I had heard none of this news. Peace talks were being held between major players in the Balkans but most, like me, had assumed that it was another performed play that would amount to little. 



  I left Hanoi a Bosnian national with documents from the old Yugoslav Mission and Bosnian Passport. In Almaty immigration, I hand over my credentials to the customs officer to have her hand me back my papers. She tells me that no match came up in their system for them, I didn’t know what to say.



  I must go now. I promise more details on my case, but shops here close at three in the afternoon now. I know the Germans have it this way, but we aren’t even in the EU. I don’t know why it’s like this now, fuck’s sake.
