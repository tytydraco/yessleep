If you've ever spent any time in the American Southwest, you've likely been to a few ghost towns, or at least heard of them. Ghost towns, contrary to the name, are not haunted attractions. While the spirits of those who have passed on do sometimes reside there, it is rare, and the moniker typically just refers to an old, abandoned town. Very often these ghost towns are all that remains of once bustling mining camps, where the ore flowed like water and the people spent their money in all kinds of ways. Such is the town I am choosing to speak about today.

Now you may be thinking: a mobile home doesn't sound like something that belongs in a mining camp from the early 20th century, and you'd be right. But not all ghost towns are completely abandoned. Some of them still have a few residents, content to live their lives away from the rest of society.

The town I speak of is called Gleeson, and it's just East of one of the most famous towns in Wild West history, which is to say, Tombstone, if my directions are correct. It doesn't look like much from the road, but a stop in at the old jail across from the hanging tree, and you can chat with the man who owns it to find out some of the history of the place. If you're lucky, he might even take you up to the main shaft, a roughly seventy-foot wide hole in the ground where you can't see the bottom unless you lean over so far that you end up falling in.

On the main stretch of road is the place of which I am speaking today. It's an abandoned mobile home behind the old general store. Both roofs of these buildings are starting to cave in, leaving the mural of a stagecoach (if my memory serves me correctly) of an stagecoach hold up on the back wall of the general store to be exposed to the elements.

Behind both of these buildings is a grandmother mesquite referred to as "The Hanging Tree," which of course will bring a song to mind if you're a fan of a certain dystopian book and movie series. But this Hanging Tree is different. I'm not quite sure it was ever used to execute criminals, though I wouldn't be surprised. But what it gets its name from is the large, metal cord that still hangs out of it, and has which much of three has grown around at this point. This cord was run from the old jail to the tree, and prisoners were tethered to it. This allowed them time in the outdoors, where the local children would lob stones at them.

I'm not usually the type to get creeped out by random buildings very easily. I see potential in them, and I very often wish I knew the history behind them. Though I wish I had never learned it, in this particular case. 

Like I said, I usually like old abandoned buildings. But every time I was near that mobile home, I felt uncomfortable, like someone was watching me or something. Of course, that seemed silly. The structure clearly wasn't lived in, and I although I do believe in ghosts, I tend to be pretty skeptical of the places that most people say are haunted. 

But it wasn't just me that felt this way. Others I'd explored this ghost town with reported the same uneasy feeling whenever they were near that mobile home. Years later, I would finally learn why. 

Now, I may be skeptical of most tales of ghosts and demons, but that doesn't mean I don't like reading them. I have plenty of books on the supposedly haunted locations of the southwest, a few of which I have visited and proved to be true or untrue. 

I think I was still living at home at this point before moving away for college, or at least home visiting for a few days, when I came across it. I had just bought one such book from a gift shop in a nearby town, and was calmly reading it in my bedroom when I came across the story of the old, broken down mobile home. When I tell you, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to discover. I warn you, if you have a weak stomach or are sensitive to violence, it may be in your best interests not to continue with this story. 

Still there? Ah, well. Your funeral, I suppose. Read at your own risk. Does that put you ill at ease? Good. It should. 

Now, as I was saying. About thirty or so years before my finding out about it, it seems that a grisly murder had happened at this mobile home. It was the home of a very evil man-- dare, I say, maybe even possessed. For all intents and purposes, he seemed to live a normal life, until one night when he and a buddy took two pretty, underage women to the mobile home with them. I'm sure I don't need to explain the rest to you, nor do I wish to go into that much detail. 

After the deed was done and the two men had satisfied their ugly, black heart's desires, they dumped the bodies in that bottomless mineshaft I mentioned earlier. They were later recovered, after the owner of the home's friend later confessed to what he'd done. 

Both went to prison. The owner of the mobile home died there, after his first pen pal, and later wife, attempted to break him out. The friend is now out and living in a different state, last I heard. 

But don't think that death was the end of that man. Oh. no. That would be too good for him. I firmly believe his spirit still haunts that house, and whatever evil spirits may have possessed him more than thirty years ago also linger there, waiting for their next victim. 

So, if you're ever driving down the Old Ghost Town Trail, have a look at some of the old buildings. But, whatever you do, DO NOT go into that house, lest you become a harbinger of violence as well.
