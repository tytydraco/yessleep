After 36 years of living in an apartment complex, I can confidently attest that a night owl is the worst kind of neighbor. Being as lucky as I am, I had one of those moving into the apartment right above mine at the start of October.

It was a lady who seemed to have an endless supply of worldly goods that all needed to be put into place the moment she moved in. Every single evening, at 9 pm exactly, she would start either hammering away, drilling the walls, or pushing furniture across her floor, always managing to reach the noise level of an angry bull in heat.

I have always had quite sensitive ears, so I’m no stranger to being awake at night because of bothersome noises. There is always noise in the city, whether from drunkards singing at the top of their lungs or nocturnal critters running amok in the streets. Trust me, the sheer number of times I’ve been woken up by an opossum knocking over a trashcan outside my window is ridiculous. The thing is - these disturbances would always be occasional and brief; whenever they occurred, I could easily fall back asleep afterwards. But ever since the day that lady moved in, the night has been filled with constant sounds of her mayhem.

The cacophony upstairs would go on every evening for about 3-4 days in a row. Then, at some point, I would hear a large thudding sound, indicating that she had brought out yet another box full of stuff that needed to be set up. This routine sent me into a hellish cycle of exhaustion: I would fall asleep late and wake up exhausted in the morning. I would then have to drown myself in coffee and go to work, hoping that I could get some sleep later in the evening.

Don’t tell me that I just should’ve confronted her. I didn’t want her to think that I was just some cranky old man. Besides, I don’t like confronting people; I have always felt awful whenever I’ve had to reprimand someone. I also didn’t know her name, which I felt would have made the interaction even more unbearable. I just sat on my couch, waiting for the commotion to stop.

Suddenly, three weeks had passed, and she showed no signs of being finished unpacking.

The seeds of chaos were planted as the clock struck 9 pm on an unusually hot evening late into October. An evening so hot that I had to have my windows open to be comfortable. The lady upstairs started toiling away, following her usual schedule.

It was just as loud as all the other days. I twisted and turned in my bed, trying to cover my ears with my pillow, as I had done so many nights before. But this night was different. The heat, mixed with my drowsiness and the sounds from upstairs, all compiled into a thundering migraine. It felt as if my brain was swelling, trying to crack my head open and run away to escape the noise. I couldn’t take it any longer.

I sat up in my bed, inhaled all the air that could fit into my lungs, and yelled:

“QUUUIIIIIEEET!”

My yelling was followed by a large thud from upstairs. She had just started unpacking another box, I thought to myself. I couldn’t believe it. She had to have heard me. My yelling was so loud that they probably heard me all the way up on the 5th floor. I stared at the ceiling, awaiting the sounds of the troublemaker and her orchestra from hell.

I waited, and then I waited some more. More time passed, but there were no more sounds coming from upstairs. Maybe she did hear me. Maybe she was finally being respectful.

I felt my headache subside as I lay back down. I closed my eyes, letting my fatigue carry me towards slumber. I was completely unbothered for the first night in a long time. I rose with the sun several hours later, and I didn’t have to chug half a liter of coffee to stay awake. I went to work with a smile on my face and a good feeling in my body.

Everything was easier. I was happier. It was paradise compared to before.

I came home that evening, hoping that the night before wasn’t an exception. If only I had been that lucky.

After the sun had gone down, there was activity in the upstairs apartment again. This time, though, the sounds were a bit different. All I could hear was

Bump…

Bump…

Bump…

Repeating over and over again.

I couldn’t place the sound. It didn’t come from any tool that I knew of; I was sure of that. There were irregular pauses between the sounds, ranging from about five seconds to ten seconds. It wasn’t just heavy footsteps, that was for sure; the spaces between them were too big. It wasn’t a hammer either; the sounds were much too quiet for that.

This thought process continued as I lay in my bed that night, my weary eyes fixated on the ceiling.

“Maybe she’s tapping her foot on the floor to a song… But the sounds are not rhythmical in the slightest … Maybe she’s dropping a ball repeatedly… But why would she even do that? Is she a juggler? No… that’d be ridiculous.”

These were but some of the thoughts rushing through my head as the sounds kept resonating in the background. It was beyond the midnight hours before I fell asleep that night.

When I woke up in the morning, the noises had stopped. I assumed that she had just started working on her apartment again. Throughout the whole day, at my work and when I went home, I silently prayed that I wouldn’t hear those sounds from her apartment again. Even though they were less noisy than normal, there was something about not being able to identify them that just made them much more annoying. To my dismay, however, the noises had begun anew by the rising of the moon.

Bump…

Bump…

Bump…

Lying in my bed that night, I was gritting my teeth out of sheer annoyance. I covered my head with my pillow again, but it was no use; I could still hear the sounds no matter how much I tried to keep them out. They made me feel as if someone was constantly poking at my brain, molding it like a piece of clay.

Maybe it was revenge; maybe, just maybe, she was mad about my yelling and was doing this to get back at me. Maybe she just wanted to drive me nuts with her antics. I tried to fall asleep, but it wasn’t happening. The sounds from upstairs echoed in my head, much louder than any of the sounds that had been there in the weeks before. It was pure agony.

My heart skipped a beat as my phone started ringing. I cautiously picked it up, wondering who was calling in the middle of the night.

“H - Hello?” I mumbled.

“Peterson! Where the fuck are you, man? We’ve been waiting for you for 45 minutes!”

“Oh, hello, sir… I’m sorry, but my shift doesn’t start till…” I looked towards my window.

The rays of sunlight had already broken through and cast light onto my floor.

“SHIT! S - Sorry, sir… I’ll be there in fifteen minutes!” I said as I got out of bed and hung up the phone.

What followed was one of the worst days I’ve ever had in my life. I was a walking corpse with only one thing on my mind: what were those sounds?

I eventually got home, and I didn’t care about relaxing. Relaxation wasn’t even on my mind. All I wanted to do, and all I did, was await the sounds. I sat on my couch, staring at the ceiling, and like clockwork, the commotion started back up late into the evening.

Bump…

Bump…

Bump…

I couldn’t take it another night; it was torture. I didn’t care what she thought of me anymore. I didn’t care about having to scold her. I stormed out the door and up the stairs and pounded on the door.

“WHAT IS YOUR FUCKING PROBLEM?!”

The sound stopped, but I wasn’t satisfied; they were going to start again. I wasn’t fooled.

I turned the door handle and walked inside. Her apartment was cold like night and as silent as a library. I walked into the living room, and that’s where I found her.

She was lying on her back at the foot of a small stepladder. She lay beside the corner of a wooden table. The corner was covered in a mixture of dried brown blood and long black hairs. On the side of her head was a crater of blood, hair, skull fragments, and brain matter. Both of her arms were mangled to the bone. A swarm of flies was nesting on her body. The windows in the living room stood open, taking in the autumn breeze and wafting away any smell of rot there should have been. As I stood there, taking it all in, I heard some skittering. I stared in disbelief as a chubby little form crept out from one of the moving crates on the floor, where it had likely been hiding from all the noise I had made.

It was an opossum, currently unaware of my presence.

It crawled over to the body and started gnawing at her hand. Every time the opossum ripped off a piece of flesh, the hand was lifted into the air before subsequently dropping to the floor, producing a light bump.
