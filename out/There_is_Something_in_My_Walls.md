Ok I’m kind of freaking out right now and I need some one to tell me whether or not I’m going crazy. I don’t know if there is anyone here that has had something similar, but if you have. Please. Help. 

It started a few weeks ago. For some back ground, my girlfriend and I finally moved in together, something that we’d been talking about for awhile now. We’ve been waiting for the right time and a house finally that made us pull the trigger. It’s everything we ever dreamed of. 

She grew up on a farm and has always wanted land to raise animals again. I grew up in the in the suburbs and have been getting pretty sick of living in the city. I’m always outdoors. Climbing, skiing, running. Helps me keep my anxious mind at bay and keeps my sleep normal. I have a tendency towards insomnia, sleep paralysis and night terrors and the exercise and fresh air works wonders. Unfortunately we both work in the nearby city so its been impossible to find a place that wasn’t a ridiculous commute. Enter this house. 

It was perfect, out on the plains tucked in a river bend. Lots of beautiful trees, including an apple orchard. Acres of land AND a barn —given it needs some work but her parents are contractors. The home itself is a two story, modest, good bones. But it had two things we loved. Its got this beautiful hand carved door made from applewood that the previous owner hand made. The patterns are beautiful, almost hypnotic. They look almost Celtic in nature. Large looping crosses surround a sprawling tree with a moon at the top and a sun with long curling rays towards the bottom. My girlfriend said it as could representation of the day, night, and the world. I thought it seemed like something out of a fantasy novel. 

The second is sitting room upstairs. The house meets in five point in a tower on top, meaning its got these wonderful high ceilings upstairs. On one side is a half of a library worth of shelves. I love books but its going to take me years to fill this thing out. On the other side it has a massive set of windows shaped like a sun, similar to the door. It faces due west and the sunsets are incredible. We fell in love instantly. It was out of our price range, but miraculously the owner loved us upon meeting and agreed to sell for about 75% of the original listing but warned us that he’s been having some problems with mice lately. We had a mouse infestation when I was young and bit me in my sleep so I don’t deal well with… critters but my girlfriend laughed and said she can handle mice. 

Ok. Now thats out of the way let me tell you what’s happening. Jumping forward to the last few weeks. The move was smooth. We spent the first nights sleeping on the floor upstairs, watching the stars through the windows and basking in the glow of new home owners. In retrospect, the third day, the last night we slept in the sitting room, was the first night I heard anything. 

Somewhere around midnight the  moon made its way west and started peeking through the window. Being a full moon, the light was so bright I came half awake. Despite it being May at the time, we’re far enough north that nights were still cold. I could feel the cold creeping through the blankets and biting into my fingers and toes. I pulled closer to my girlfriend and began to fall back to sleep. As I drifted off, I heard a light scratching coming from somewhere around me. I couldn’t pin point where it was coming from, but it sounded like the walls by the windows. Like the way a dog running across floorboards sounds but quieter. I felt this weird shiver go down my spine. I thought at the time this was just a result of my mild phobia. After last night I’m not so sure. 



I heard the sound a few more times in the following weeks, mostly at night but sometimes during the day too. I keep asking my girlfriend about it but she has yet to hear anything. She has been putting out traps for me though —non kill ones bless her. The sounds just keep getting more frequent and louder. 

Last night I was up late reading in the sitting room. Its been a month now and it was another full moon. The moonlight was so bright I didn’t even need a lamp to read by. The reading eventually caught up to me and I accidentally fell asleep on our new couch in there. I woke up around midnight and something was off. Firstly it was freezing in there. Like I could see my breath cold. I’ve seen snow in June before where we are but this year has been beautiful. Then the scratching started. 

This time it was NOT mild scrabbling. It was like something —maybe many somethings?—was *digging* through the wood around the window towards me. I tried to get up but my body was frozen. Possibly the worst time to get an episode of sleep paralysis ever. My eyes were stuck open though and I swear I saw something *moving* in the wall.  This is where you’ll think I sound crazy. I swear to god, sitting their frozen, I saw a face pushing through the wood. It’s eyes met mine and I passed out instantly. I don’t remember much else but I do remember one thing. He had two tattoos. A moon on his left cheek and a sun on his right. 


I woke up this morning shaking. I haven’t told my girlfriend yet, I still need time to process. I’m really this is just my anxieties talking and it was just another night terror combined with a childhood phobia of mice  but I can’t shake the feeling it was different. Usually my night terrors are just faceless shadows. 

Am I crazy for worrying about this? I really love this house and we already signed the paperwork so it feels too late to back out. Has anyone heard of stuff like this? I really need to find out what the sun and moon designs are. Maybe I’ll call the previous owner tomorrow.
