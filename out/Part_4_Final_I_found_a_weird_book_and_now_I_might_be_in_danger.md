I won’t lie, everything has been messy this last week, like a tornado flirted with a thunderstorm to create the absolute disaster that is the current state of my life.

I had been tired, so, so tired with a headache just behind my eyes that, no matter how many aspirin I took, wouldn’t go away, and it had only gotten worse since the night my roommate said my name aloud.

I had no appetite, which if you knew me personally, you’d say that was extraordinarily out of character.

I could barely sleep, and when I did, it wasn’t for long. I couldn’t remember my dreams, if I had any; I only remembered darkness, an empty place I couldn’t wake from until the sun broke the horizon.

I was even sent home from work a few days ago because I couldn’t focus. I kept forgetting things. I hadn’t been back since.

All of this, including the headache, I would’ve blamed on stress. The brain is powerful, and when your mental health depletes, in a way, your body sort of gives up. So yeah, I would’ve pointed a finger at stress and told the police to book them and read them their rights, that was until I noticed my reflection move out of the corner of my eye.

It was a few nights ago. I was brushing my teeth, and when I went to spit out the mouthwash, I caught a glimpse of my reflection holding steady as if I was still just staring at the mirror rather than bending over. I didn’t believe it at first, of course. I figured I was delirious from lack of sleep and from the terrible headache. But as I went to leave the bathroom, there was no denying it.

The person in the mirror didn’t match my movements and, instead, only turned their head to watch me leave.

I tried to ignore it; however, the unsettling feeling enveloping me had me spinning around to catch the reflection in the act.

There it was. Moving with me. Doing everything I did. Being everything a reflection should be.

After that encounter, I thought I understood the book a little more.

*It searches for a being to call its own*

*You’re lost in a land you can’t escape.*

*A reflection that walks without a mirror.*

*It isn’t you, and yet, it is.*

Or maybe I was just making assumptions based on a horror story.

Whatever it was, I felt the shadow’s hold on me. It whispered to me, murmurs only audible to my ears. What did it say? I didn’t know. It just sounded like noise.

It didn’t want me. It wanted *to be me*. It needed a vessel. I was trying my best to keep it at bay, using my resilience to overpower its will. But I felt weaker every day, and the weaker I became, the nearer it trod.

Everything got to me. It was 2:30 a.m. I laid in bed, blank gaze fixed on the ceiling, the murmurs like static in my ears, drowning out all other sounds, silencing every one of my thoughts. It was too much. I clutched the bed sheets, clenched my eyes shut, ground my teeth—*anything to make it stop!*

My hands flew to my head, nails digging into my scalp.

*Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!*

The static loudened.

The growl seeping out between my lips drew to nearly a yell of frustration—desperation—only for the quiet, melodic tune of my ringtone to stop it.

I glanced over to my nightstand, at my phone whose black screen displayed ‘Unknown Caller,” and wearily reached for it.

*Who’d be calling this early in the morning?*

When I answered, the word “hello” barely left my mouth before the person on the other end started to talk.

*“You let it in, and you let it get too close.”*

The monotone voice came through the receiver. It was deep and hoarse, but, in a strange way, it was familiar.

I sat up. “What? Who is this?”

*“You don’t know me by name.”*

“But I know you?”

There was a pause. *“You don’t have much longer.”*

My brow furrowed. “What do you mean? What’re you talking about?”

*“The book.”*

The phone nearly fell from my hand as I stiffened. “You know about the book?”

*“Know about it?”* They laughed. *“I wrote it.”*

“What sort of sick game are you playing?”

*“This ain’t no game, kid”—I knew this voice; how did I know this voice?—“This is life or death, and if you don’t take it seriously, you’ll have more than the monster under your bed to worry about.”*

It was my turn to laugh—scoff, really. “You’re insane. Monsters aren’t real.”

They hummed. *“I bet that’s what you told yourself the night your sister died.”*

My stomach plummeted. There was a terribly apparent hitch in my voice as I said, “What? Alana—She’s…My sister *isn’t dead*. Who the hell are you?”

*“I’m the one who gave you that necklace. The one sitting in your side table drawer.”*

My head jolted toward the nightstand. There was a soft *thump* as the phone hit the comforter, followed by sheets raking backward as I scrambled for it.

*Necklace? What necklace? What were they talking about?*

I opened the drawer and was greeted with dozens of envelopes, pens, scrap paper, sticky notes, and whatever else I tossed in there from time to time. I pushed it all aside, dug through the pile of miscellaneous items until, at last, I came upon something hidden underneath it all, something that I could’ve put there ages ago or just yesterday; I couldn’t remember.

A wire pendant in the shape of three spirals dangling from a back thread.

I picked it up, looked it over, glided my finger over the curved lines, something poking at the forefront of my brain, demanding to be center. It almost felt like I should’ve known what it meant.

There was a time when I never took the necklace off. That knowledge was etched into my memory like scratch marks on slate. I slept with it, wore it everywhere I went. I had to; I had no other choice.

I just didn’t know why.

It was something I found in the woods when I was a child. Alana and I were playing. We went too far…The necklace was…I had found it in the grass in a clearing. I swore I found it.

A vision flashed in my mind—a woman with red, braided hair wearing black clothes. The image spun. I couldn’t concentrate. She was tall, or was I short? She handed me something, told me it would…save her life?

I looked around. It was night, but everything was bathed in moonlight. A young girl was across the way, admiring boulders. She said something to me. What did she say?

It went quiet…

Something rustled in the brush.

From the darkness crept antlers, and with them was the skull of a deer, empty eye sockets staring at me with the intent to kill.

*Monsters aren’t real.*

My mouth went dry. My skin went cold.

The fur-covered beast stood crooked on hooved feet, its arms bundled at its chest, its head twisting like a wrench.

*Monsters aren’t real! They aren’t!*

It made a cautious approach toward a young, scared, and helpless girl before bearing down its claws.

*Monsters…aren’t…*

The creature was right in front of me, its warm breath against my skin, but in the blink of an eye, it dropped dead, and the girl was lying in the grass. I ran to her, fell to my knees beside her.

Why? Who was she?

She was covered in blood, coughing, gasping. I was terrified. I didn’t know what to do. She was dying. The girl…The girl was…

Her brown eyes dulled, and the rise and fall of her chest slowed.

*Alana?*

There was a quick *clack* when the necklace hit the nightstand.

The voice over the phone mumbled, but between it being facedown and buried in bed clothes, I didn’t hear a word.

Once I found it, a shaky grip brought it to my ear. “What,” I stuttered. “What did you say?” My gaze didn’t leave the necklace.

*“I said, ‘Are you done with your life crisis?’ You have a cryptid in your damn house, and it’s trying to kill you.”*

“A cryptid?”

They sighed. *“Listen, kid. I’ve been tracking this thing for weeks, and I’ll be damned if I let it get away again.”*

I swallowed hard, eyes darting to the space between the door and the floor, awaiting the footfalls that belonged to no one but creaked outside my room night after night. “And what is *it* exactly?”

*“A doppelgänger.”*

I took a deep, yet quivering breath, calculating my next words, wondering if I even believed this stranger. It was like a campfire story, a tale the older kids told to get a few gasps and screams from the younger crowd. How could anyone, in their right mind, believe in a campfire story? “So, let me get this straight. You wrote a book that releases a—” The word caught on my tongue, stung it like a wasp—“*monster*, and you gave that book to me for, what, fun? Kicks? What is this?”

*“For someone who has no idea what they’re talking about, you sure talk a lot. Just keep your mouth shut for a second, yeah?”*

I took the liberty of scowling during the lull in the conversation, tempted to hang up then and there, but I was equally tempted to hear them out because, well, I couldn’t deny the inexplicable things happening to me—the noises, the apparitions, my dog’s sudden cowardice. So, I waited for their explanation, thinking maybe, maybe it’d make some ounce of sense.

*“First of all,”* they started, *“I didn’t* give you *the damn book. It manifests wherever it’s needed, and you obviously didn’t heed its warning.”*

“Excuse me—”

*“Second of all,”* she continued, louder and more enunciated in an attempt to quiet my interruption, *“I wrote it to* warn people—*again, a warning you ignored—so the cryptid would remain powerless. It gains power through its victims. And lastly,”* they paused. *“Actually, that’s pretty much it. From the amount of dark energy around you, the cryptid is a little too close for comfort. How long haven’t you been able to sleep?”*

I didn’t answer right away. A strangled noise came from my throat, and I just didn’t know what to say. It was like something came crashing down on me then, or something I was too afraid to let in began suffocating me from the inside out. What this person was saying…

Monsters are real?

A child’s laughter arose in the back of my mind but soon devolved into whimpers.

*I think we should go, Alana.*

*They’re just rocks.*

*Run, Alana! Run!*

*My sister coughed up blood at my feet. I was crying. I felt helpless. The woman…She handed me the necklace. She said…She said…*

*Every night, you’ll give a little of your life essence to her in order to keep her alive. During the ritual, however, you’ll be dead for sixty seconds.*

I took the phone from my ear and looked at the time.

The hour struck 3 a.m., and when I glanced away from the screen, I was no longer in my bedroom. Darkness had swallowed me, fog slithering past like its entrails. I began to walk, overcome with a feeling of horrific familiarity.

“Hello?”

My echo called back.

It felt like I wandered through the nothingness for hours, an endless void of black and fog and dead grass beneath my steps. And the longer it went on, the more that familiar feeling gripped my memory.

I knew this place. I visited it every night. What I thought was a vague dream during the little amount of sleep I got was this…This place…

*Nowhere Land.*

As the name faded, my eyes snapped open, and I was back in my room in my bed, holding the phone in front of me.

The time sat in the left corner of the screen.

3:01 a.m.

Everything became quiet. My face felt long with a frown whose quivering lip needed to be bitten as if to fend off the sorrow and grief. But tears welled up in my eyes anyway, and without a second thought, the emotions bursting from me continued through the floodgates in the form of a single sentence, a sentence that sounded irrefutably insane even unspoken, a sentence I never thought I’d ever say but was undeniably true.

[“My sister died.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10cndzj/every_morning_at_3_am_i_die_to_save_my_sisters/) Every word was like a shard of glass shattering against an unforgiving force. “She really died, and I…”

*“You saved her,”* the person—that same woman who handed me the tool necessary to sacrifice myself for my sister—finished what I was still too irresolute to say. *“What you saw that night as a child was real, and what you’re experiencing now is real. If you don’t do exactly what I tell you, the doppelgänger* will *consume you.”*

I wiped the blurriness from my vision and the dampness from my cheeks, failing to keep my composure but refusing to stop trying. The breath I took was calming, near-steady; I closed my eyes to take it all in.

When I opened them, undoubtedly uncertain what’d happen next, I said, with as much conviction as I could muster while on the verge of a total breakdown, “Tell me what I have to do.”
