First off, I wanted to thank you all and for the helpful suggestions everyone had made including naming the weird unnatural cockroach, Phil. And I got a suggestion to use fridge magnets to communicate with the bathroom/mirror spirit. I had thought about it to be honest. But I still don’t know if the ghost can move through my entire apartment, despite those boot prints that seemed to come out of the mirror. And I did thank the mirror ghost for helping with that poor woman who lost her finger who tried to rob me by pretending to be a Psychic Medium. My best friend had suggested I use a Ouija board to communicate with the bathroom ghost or any other entities in the apartment. 

I feel bad right now, my new neighbor, he can’t move, I am waiting for an ambulance for him. While I do that, I thought I’d like to give you guys an update on the last little bit that has happened. Let me explain what happened on laundry day. 

Have you ever met those people that seemed to be full of nothing but bursting energy? *Those* type of morning people with a huge smile on their face, the optimistic kind? Well, I did. My new neighbor who had just moved in across from the hall from me. Conveniently. I had met him while I was dragging my laundry basket out in the hall and so had he. The moment I met him, I knew we were not going to get along. His first words to me were, ‘Hi, neighbor, lovely day, isn’t it? Are you doing laundry too? Great, you can show me where the laundry room is.’ (By the way it was snowing outside when he said how lovely the day is). And I just stood with a slacked jaw at him. 

He just assumed I’d be helpful. I had Phil, (the cockroach) riding on top of my basket, he loves laundry day, he had his tiny little snorkel and goggles on. When I do laundry, he likes to take his bath, the first time he did it, I thought he was trying to kill himself. But when I got a better look, he had a snorkel and goggles. 

My neighbor whose name I didn’t ask for is Jack. He saw Phil on top of my clothes and screams, ‘Cockroach!’ and swatted Phil which he was thrown in the air, and I heard a faint tick sound when he hit the floor. At the end of the hall there is another apartment. The door creaked open, and I swore I heard Phil screaming, just a tiny little scream, it was faint. The severed arm came out of that room and snatched Phil and dragged him into its room and the apartment room door slammed shut. 

I was aghast at him. But honestly, I couldn’t find fault in him for swatting Phil, I mean who is nice to cockroaches? And I am sure he’s fine, pretty sure. I had found out earlier that severed arm has an apartment room. I am not sure if it belongs to anyone, the arm I mean. If you know anyone missing a sentient arm, I know where to find it. And I don’t know if it pays rent in that apartment. A weird thought had occurred to me, how does a severed arm pay rent? Seriously the only job I can see it getting into is being a hand model. Pushing those thoughts out of the way. I had to get my laundry done on my only day off, and doing laundry isn’t as exciting as it sounds. 

I had debated on making another post. Not saying the unnatural things aren’t happening to me at all. But I think writing out my experiences in this apartment building might be something good for me, an outlet if you will. As I had stated before I can only get a good enough signal from the laundry facilities down in the basement of my building, in order to access it, each tenant is given a fob key to get inside it. Now going down to the basement always creeped me out. The ceiling was always lower than on the upper levels of the hallways. In the laundry room there is no windows, I mean I do understand why, it’s almost underground anyways. But it always makes me feel claustrophobic. It does scream serial killer basement too.  

And the worst part is when I hit that last step to walk down that long stretch of hall to get to the laundry room, the lights above are motion activated. It wouldn’t be so bad if it weren’t for the fact that they took at least five seconds to register your presence, leaving you in pitch-blackness for longer than I really feel comfortable with. Jack thought he was being funny and making those ghosts sounds when he saw how dark it was. I think he was trying to make a joke because he was terrified of going any further. I almost smiled at his antics. 

That was one of the many problems, the other was, that as soon as those lights flicker on, they tended to flicker like a bad B-horror movie. So, when I do come down here to do laundry or get a signal on my phone, I find myself imagining the lights coming on, and seeing someone waiting, perfectly still at the end of the hall. And now that I have Jack with me, I could just use him as a human shield if there happened to be a serial killer in waiting. 

I was way too annoyed to be worried about flickering lights in a creepy hall. To recap, earlier that morning, I had gotten out of bed and found my entire bathroom flooded with water. I had called the maintenance guy to check my bathroom to see what the problem is, but Leroy took one look and said, ‘don’t know what it is, missy, I’ll have to tear the whole bathroom apart to find out what it is,’ You can imagine my mortification. So, Leroy had said they have to basically tear my bathroom apart and my neighbors because their bathroom is doing it too. ‘Looks like you got yourself a pest problem too, though I can help with that right now.’ He spotted Phil eating my Twinkie I had left on my dresser as we passed my bedroom. I had only taken a small bite out of it this morning before I had realized my carpet was drenched in bathroom water. And I hate wet socks, and I panicked after seeing that I left my Twinkie on the dresser.

And that damn walking upright cockroach ate half of my Twinkie. It was as if that roach understood Leroy and lifted its head up and its antennas flicked, and those beady black eyes stared at us with a look of smugness that I wanted to flick right off its face.

I’m not going to get into major detail, but Leroy chased the cockroach around my bedroom. He even stomped on it; the familiar small crack could be heard. I felt guilty, inexplicitly, I don’t why, but I was sort of warming up to the little fella. When Leroy puffed up his chest in gratification that he got the upper hand. He lifted his foot, unfortunately Phil wasn’t going down without a fight. I swore, I saw the Phil flick the middle finger up at Leroy. He was on top of Leroy’s boot, and then the bug scurried quickly up into Leroy’s pants and Leroy freaked out and ran out of my apartment declaring war on Phil.

Phil did come back, and I swore I saw the cockroach laughing hysterically. But I couldn’t be quite sure. Anyway, I had gathered all my clothes and headed down to the laundry facility after I ran into my new neighbor Jack, and everything happened with Phil and the severed arm. 

I used my fob key to open the door, the blip and light indicated that I had access, I pushed the door open with my hips as I dragged my laundry basket inside and breathing heavy from the weight of it. Jack followed right after me. The fluorescent lights in the laundry facility worked just fine, it was only the hallway that flickered. I think there might be some wires crossed, which I am thankful for not having to endure the flickering in the laundry room itself. I saw something scurry right passed my shoe, I nearly screamed. I had heard rats are seen down here from time to time by the other neighbors. But as my eye caught sight of what scampered past my feet, I felt slightly relieved. It was that damn cockroach from my apartment. He somehow had gotten away from the severed arm and was still wearing his snorkel and goggles.  

I picked a washer and threw my clothes inside. Jack was a very chatty guy. He all but basically told me his life story, how he was born in Louisiana, from Nola I guess that was slang for New Orleans. When I asked him about his accent, he told me that when he was a teenager his father sent him to a boarding school in New York and was bullied for years because he had a *hillbilly* accent and he decided to teach himself not use his southern drawl. I told him his bullies were just jealous because only those people with those type of accents can only marry their cousins and if they did it, it would be just weird. Fun fact, apparently, I do a great Cajun accent. We were just finishing up drying our clothes and I was pulling my clothes in my laundry basket when I heard a tiny chirp, I looked over at the door thinking someone else was coming in, but as I realized the chirp was not electronic.

Jack looked at me with a confused look on his face too. So, we concentrated our hearing to see if we could hear it again. And we did. Slowly we approached it, it was coming from behind the barrel that was a garbagecan. Jack hurried and pulled the garbagecan away and we both stared in disbelief. There was a green blob with six black eyes staring up at us. Jack said it reminded him of something called a blobfish but green. I had no idea what that was until he explained it to me

And I still don’t know what it is. 

It chirped again. 

“It’s adorable,” I said. 

“We should leave it alone encase its mother comes back,” he said slowly glancing about as if he was trying to find a larger version of it. It looked all alone. 

When I reached over to see if I could pet it, it opened its wide impossibly huge circular mouth, and it had rows and rows of small sharp fangs like shark teeth. And it launched at me with murder intent in its six eyes, to my surprise Jack used the garbagecan and smooshed it. The sound of it was a literal splat. Slowly he lifted the garbagecan and green goo was smashed into the linoleum floor and the bottom of the trash can. 

“You killed it!” I gasped. 

The look of guilt quickly flicked across his eyes and he looked uneasy as if he was—he threw up in that very same garbagecan. I told him karma was going to get him, he just laughed at me. After that horrifying moment, I had called Leroy and told him that there was a mess in on and in the garbagecan and the smell of vomit was putrid. Leroy was not happy to be called away from his lunch. 

Jack and I stopped at our doors and said our goodbyes and promises that we’d see each other again, you know what? I think I can tolerate him. As I walked into my waterboarded apartment, I had a sense of dread. Phil leapt off my clothes and into the small puddles on my hardwood floor. “have fun,” I curled my lip. The mysterious water could be toilet water for all I know. As I was putting my clothes away, I heard Jack screaming for help. Instinctively I was going to ignore him, but after what we went through downstairs. I ran to his apartment and knocked on his door. 

“The door is unlocked!” His pained voice was strained, so I pushed myself in and saw he was underneath a six-foot bookcase and heavy books. He barely was able to turn his head towards me, the relief look in his face said it all. “Can you help me? My shoulder hurts.” 

It wasn’t that easy to just lift a bookcase, I couldn’t do it. I tried; I had called the ambulance fifteen minutes ago. I had started losing hope until the paramedics ran in. I got to make this quick, I’m going to ride the ambulance with Jack to the hospital. And I hope to give another update soon and Jacks condition, and the condition of my apartment. Weird that I can get a good signal in Jack’s apartment. As I was right behind the paramedics I had to stop when I heard it. A chirping noise. I stopped at the doorway, and I saw it near the bookcase, the green gelatinous tiny monster was that weird thing we saw in the laundry room. I kept eye contact with the little beast, it chirped one last time and it slithered like a snake and like a slug leaving a slimy trail to a tiny whole in the wall big enough for a small rodent to run into. It disappeared in a blink. I shuddered and wondered if that small little creature pushed the bookcase on Jack because he smooshed it earlier.
