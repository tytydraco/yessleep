It was my first day at Anri Dance Classes. I had hoped to learn some Kathak dance for the dance functions that our apartment society conducts every two months. To give some information about me, I am a twenty-five-year-old aspiring author, but I am not an unsuccessful one. The habit of creative writing had been drilled into me from a young age (I would receive flying slippers otherwise) and I already have two bestselling novels under my belt. 



Comfortable with my life, I wanted to develop a new hobby and happened to find Anri Dance Classes, although in a very desolate area of my colony, while I was riding my bicycle for some exercise. When I went inside the building for the first time, there was only one man around to help me with the paperwork- an old, slouching man with a bent spine- named Mr. Gopal. He did not speak much but had a very depressed aura around him. Like the one you get when the person in front of you has just lost a close relative.



Afterwards, I had gone to that locality three times- to fill the form for the classes and undertake other formalities- and there was literally no one around within sight. It was only after I would walk and come to the main road that the routine ugly-honking cars and tea and biscuit shops would come into picture. But because I am an adventurous lady who lives in a place where there has not been any serious crime for the past decade, I decided to give it a go, despite the isolated atmosphere around the building where the classes will be held. So where was I earlier? Of course, today was supposed to be my first day of learning Kathak.



I entered the building and went up the stairs. An old wooden door stood in front of me, and I was about to open it until I heard my name being called from my right. Mr. Gopal stood there with a walking stick and a piece of cloth in his hand. He walked in his awkward manner and came to stand in front of me and extended the piece of cloth, a red rectangular fabric, and instructed me to keep it tied around my eyes throughout the dance.



“What are you saying? Is this a joke?” I laughed at him.



“No, this is not. If you value your life and your family’s life, keep it tied around your eyes at all times. If you don't, the girls will identify that you are not one of theirs and will try to harm you and your family. And another thing, if they ever demand anything from you, like a dress or makeup stuff that girls your age use, just give it to them the next day. Never refuse them.”



I turned my gaze away from him to look at the cloth in my hands and turned them back to him, but he had vanished by then.

  


Realizing that Mr. Gopal’s mental state may just be denigrating because of his age, so I just stuffed the red cloth in my bag and went inside. 



As soon as I entered the room, a sharp smell of incense hit my nose, and I started feeling nostalgic for some reason. There was one charpoy (a wooden bed) and two sofas in the room. And on the charpoy sat the Kathak teacher. He was a plump, bespectacled man. But the first thing that hit me when I laid my eyes upon him is that I really, really did not like him. He was chewing upon some betal leafs and had a wretched air about him. I wanted to turn away and leave the classes immediately, but realizing that I had come this far, I decided to brave through. He gestured to me to sit upon the sofa and started asking my general background as the sound of Ghungroo started chiming in from the next room. For those who don't know, a Ghungroo is a musical anklet tied to the feet of classical Indian dancers during their dance performance or dance practice and they make sounds as one performs. This was weird, as the girls present there (who should be making the ghungroo sounds)  should have filled in from the wooden door. But I guessed that they had already arrived for their lessons, so didn't think much of it. Actually, their presence brought me comfort, as I was not alone with this man.



After the basic inquiries were done, he suddenly questioned me about the red cloth. 



“Gopal must have given you some red cloth, didn't he?”



“Yes” I answered, feeling that this topic was a little out of place.



“Don't listen to that old bag. His ugly wife died in some fire a few years back and he has gone insane after that and disturbs my students with his idiotic requests. Throw it away after the class is done.”



“Okay” I replied nervously.



The teacher guided me to the room where the classes were to be held, and I entered. And I immediately wanted to run away once again, as all the girls there had a black cloth tied around their eyes as they giggled and chatted away. As soon as the teacher cleared his throat, they all turned to look at him, or rather, me. Despite the fact they could obviously not see me, I could feel all of their gazes upon me. And all of them had wide smiles that were stretching their mouth from ear to ear as they continued to look in my direction. 



“Girls, we have a new student in class today. Please welcome her.”



The girls just continued to stare at me from their places, with the abhorrent smiles upon their faces. I counted and there were seven girls. The teacher soon cleared his throat and asked us to stand in lines for our lessons. 



The whole affair remained uncomfortable. I could feel the red cloth burning a hole in my bag as I felt out of place as the only girl with sight in our class. But it seemed like the cloth around their eyes did little to deter the girls, as they continued moving their legs and arms in extremely complicated combinations and they were obviously very well trained. I was given a very basic movement to learn that day. They continued giggling throughout the lesson and that just made me more and more uncomfortable.  



After the class was over, one of the girls came up to me as I was drinking from my bottle, and she made a ridiculous demand from me, that I get her a bottle of perfume the next day. I scoffed at that and immediately left the place. I am nobody’s servant, politeness be damned. 



The next day when I went to the class, Mr. Gopal was not there. Strange, but I continued anyway. As soon as I went inside the dance room, the girl that had requested me the perfume yesterday came up to me and asked me if I had brought her the same or not. I told her that I did not bring her anything. At my reply, a look of anger came up on her face and the class was deathly silent today except for the sound of Ghungroo and feet movements. I could feel everybody’s glare upon me.

I went home, feeling perturbed. I had decided to quit the classes now. I just can't survive in a weird place like that. But at night, I think I heard Ghungroo sounds from my father’s room while I was going to the kitchen to get water. The next day, to all of our horror, there were sharp scratch marks on my father’s back that looked like they were drawn with a knife, and he looked deathly ill. 



Remembering the Ghungroo sound yesterday, I hurried to the classes, my gut telling me that this was the work of one of those girls. I entered the dance class to see all the girls giggling and chatting amongst themselves as usual. Come to think of it, what do they chat about, since I cannot identify their language?



I quickly scanned the room and saw the girl that was demanding the perfume talking to another in front of her. I angrily went to her and demanded if she had anything to do with the injuries with my father. To this, she only smiled wider and wider until I thought her mouth couldn't stretch any more. Angrily, I took the cloth off her face and was immediately horrified-because her eyes had empty sockets.



Now feeling like someone had just punched me, I ran out of there. I have arrived in my room and am hiding under the covers now, chanting a prayer that wards off evil spirits. 



But I think that it is not working out, as I can hear the sound of Ghungroo coming from the direction of the ceiling fan and I think the perfume girl has followed me home and is perched on my ceiling fan. I can feel her staring at the back of my head with her empty eye sockets. I don't want to turn my head around and I am determinedly staring at my mobile screen, typing on Reddit, hoping someone will give me some clue as to what to do in this situation. Do you guys have any advice?
