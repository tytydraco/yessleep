I am from the Philippines, and I have a chilling story to tell.

Several years ago, when I was in college, I decided to rent a dormitory near the university belt in Manila for convenience. The traffic was horrendous, and commuting all the way back south after classes would have been exhausting. To save money, three of us—my childhood bestfriend Gina, another female student who later became a close friend, and I—shared a tiny, cramped room. Let’s call our new friend Jessa.

It was late October, right before *Undas* (All Saints’ Day), when most students would go home for the semester break. Gina and I decided to return to Cavite (Philippine Province) to spend time with our families, leaving Jessa alone in the dorm. She had rehearsals for a college program and couldn’t afford to take time off.

Four days into our break, in the dead of night, my phone rang unexpectedly. It was Jessa.

Her voice trembled with unease as she demanded to know if Gina was truly with me—if we had actually left together or if we were playing some elaborate prank on her.

Her voice was laced with panic.

*"Is Gina really with you?"*

The urgency in her tone startled me.

*"Of course, she is! Why are you asking?"*

There was silence on the other end. Then she mumbled, *“Nothing… never mind,”* and abruptly hung up.

Confused and unsettled, I shook off the feeling and went back to sleep.

It wasn’t until we returned to the dorm a week later that Jessa, visibly shaken, finally revealed what had terrified her that night.

While Gina and I were away, Jessa had the room to herself. Our bunk bed stood empty—Gina always slept on the top bunk, while Jessa took the lower one. I preferred the couch.

That night, with all the lights off and only the dim glow of her phone illuminating the room, Jessa lay in bed, engrossed in a mobile game. The silence was comforting—until she heard it.

A faint rustling from the upper bunk.

She ignored it at first, assuming it was just the dorm settling. But then, **she felt it.**

A presence.

Before she could process the situation, **something leaned over the edge of the upper bunk**.

A face of a woman eerily familiar—pale, distorted—peered down at her from the darkness.

Then, **it spoke**.

*"Psssst... Jessa... Do I look like your dorm mate?"*

Her breath hitched.

She **couldn't move.**

The voice was eerily familiar.

It sounded *exactly* like Gina.

But Gina was miles away.

Cold terror gripped her as she bolted upright, scrambling for the door, never once daring to look back. She fled the dormitory and spent the rest of the night at a nearby convenience store, too afraid to return.

After that, we didn’t stay in that dorm for long. A transfer to another dormitory was enough of an excuse to leave that cursed place behind.

But to this day, I swear—**there was something in that room.**

Something watching. Waiting.

Something that knew us far too well.
