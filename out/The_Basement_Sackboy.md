It started the night I moved into my grandmother’s old house. She had passed away the year prior, leaving the place to me—a creaking, decaying relic from the 1940s with a smell of mildew that seemed to seep from the walls. It wasn’t exactly my dream home, but I was fresh out of college and broke, so I decided to make it work.

The basement was the worst part. Damp, dark, and filled with years of my grandmother’s hoarded treasures and trash. One evening, as I was sorting through the piles of junk, I found it—a Sackboy doll.

You know Sackboy, right? From Little Big Planet? The doll was a perfect replica, except… not quite. Its button eyes weren’t uniform; one was red and the other green, giving it a lopsided, almost malevolent appearance. Its stitched smile was crooked, curling higher on one side, making it look more like a sneer than a grin.

Something about it unsettled me, but I chalked it up to the overall creepy vibe of the basement. I tossed the doll into a box with some other old toys, figuring I’d deal with it later.

That night, I heard footsteps creaking across the hardwood floor.

At first, I thought it was the house settling—it was old, after all. But these footsteps were deliberate, starting at one end of the hallway and stopping just outside my bedroom door. I froze, clutching my blanket. There were no further sounds.

In the morning, I found nothing out of place, and I convinced myself I’d imagined it. That was until I went back to the basement to finish cleaning.

The Sackboy doll wasn’t in the box where I’d left it.

I searched the entire basement, thinking maybe I’d accidentally thrown it somewhere else, but it was gone. That was when I noticed something odd. On the dusty floor, leading up the stairs, were small, shoe-like footprints.

They were far too small to belong to any human.

That night, I locked my bedroom door.

The footsteps came again, louder this time. They stopped at my door, and then… the handle began to rattle.

I didn’t sleep that night.

The next morning, I found the Sackboy doll sitting on the kitchen counter. It was holding one of my knives, its tiny hands wrapped tightly around the hilt.

I stared at it, my heart pounding. Was someone playing a prank on me? Was I losing my mind?

I grabbed the doll and threw it into the garbage outside, stuffing it deep under layers of trash. I wasn’t taking any chances.

That night, I heard the footsteps again.

But this time, they didn’t stop at my door.

I woke up to the sound of something scratching at my bed frame. I turned on the lamp, and there it was—the Sackboy doll, sitting on my nightstand, its head tilted toward me. The knife was gone, but one of its button eyes was dangling by a thread, as if it had been through something.

I didn’t know what else to do. I grabbed the doll and drove it out to the woods, as far away from the house as I could manage. I buried it in a shallow grave under a tree and left without looking back.

For the first time in weeks, I slept peacefully.

Until the smell woke me.

A rancid, putrid stench filled the room, like rotting flesh and stagnant water. I gagged, stumbling out of bed to turn on the light. The Sackboy doll was there, sitting on the floor by the door.

Its stitching was undone in places, and I could see something black and oozing inside it, like tar. The dangling button eye was now gone entirely, leaving an empty hole that seemed to stare right at me.

And then it moved.

Just a twitch, its head tilting ever so slightly, but it was enough to send me into a blind panic. I grabbed the doll and threw it into the fireplace, dousing it in lighter fluid before setting it alight.

It screamed.

Not like a human scream, but a high-pitched, distorted wail, like metal grinding against metal. The flames flickered and roared, and the doll’s silhouette writhed in the fire until it was nothing but ash.

I thought it was over.

But then I heard the footsteps again.

They came from the basement this time, slow and deliberate, ascending the stairs.

I locked myself in my room, trembling, as the footsteps stopped outside my door. The rattling of the handle was more violent now, as if whatever was out there was angry.

I don’t know how long I stayed awake, but eventually, the sounds stopped.

In the morning, I found a single scrap of burlap on my pillow, stained with black tar.

I sold the house the next week.

But sometimes, late at night, I still hear the footsteps.
