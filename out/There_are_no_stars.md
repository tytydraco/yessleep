I haven't seen my friend in a year. Her blog just updated. Here's what it says:  


Wednesday 16th March 2022  
  
Last night Robert didn't come back. Jake did but he hasn't said a word. After questioning and begging him to tell us where Robert was, Janine started screaming at him. She turned hysterical. I intervened when she grabbed his collar and started shaking him. I told her that maybe he needed some time. She stormed back to her room and sobbed there for maybe an hour. I left Jake alone hoping he would gather himself and come round. Before he could, Janine came back screaming at him once more. Still no response.   
  
All he had been doing was sitting at the dining table staring at the wall. Sometimes he would sob and sniffle. Janine’s renewed fury didn't seem to change that at all.  
  
Then Janine grabbed a knife.   
  
She threatened him in a cold and strangled voice. He just stared ahead. She started shrieking and slammed the knife into the table close to his hand. When I saw her raise the knife again, I jumped in to grab her around the waist, but she knocked me to the floor.   
  
When I got up, she was standing there panting. The knife lodged 3 inches deep into Jake’s shoulder.   
  
He hadn’t made a sound. Hadn’t moved an inch in his seat. He just turned and stared at her with a distant gaze on his tear stained face. She stopped then. Her face scrunched up, as she started to cry once more, then fled back to her room, leaving the knife in his shoulder.  
  
I'm not entirely sure why I'm writing this. There's been no internet connection here. Maybe it's just to manage the fear before we set out. Make some sense of what is happening. Maybe it’s so I have some notes to refer to when we reach the police. Maybe it's to leave something behind if we don't make it. I’m finding it hard to believe, I just wrote that sentence. I hope I’ll read this entry again some day and laugh at it.  
  
We arrived here, Marina Lodge in East Gippsland, Victoria, on Saturday evening. We’ve been here for three full days since. Today is the fourth morning.  
  
Janine has been my best friend since high school. Robert is (was?) her latest boyfriend she'd made at college. They wanted to come out here for a bit of a break in nature and invited me along. Jake was Robert's friend. Maybe they thought Robert and I would make a cute pair, I'm not sure. He's alright. Was alright.  
  
The drive up here from Melbourne was fine. We conversed about everything. Hobbies, movies, politics. Nothing dramatic. I usually sleep on these long drives but Robert was a good at keeping a conversation going and very funny. I could see why Janine liked him.   
  
We turned off the highway through a small town. Darby, I believe. We didn't stop there. We drove through and shortly after, turned off onto a dirt road into the forest. There had been a small sign with Marina Lodge on it indicating the turn off. We couldn't have driven for ten minutes on that road before we reached the lodge.   
  
No one greeted us. An envelope lay on the front door mat with keys and a welcome letter. The letter had a standard list of rules to follow and a number to contact management if need be. Fire restrictions and warnings were all on a low. It has been a wet autumn the weeks before we arrived.   
  
We unpacked the car. There were six bedrooms to choose from. Janine and Robert took the one closest to the bathrooms. I picked the one closest to the stairs on the opposite end, and Jake took the room two doors down from me. Janine and Robert made dinner. We'd come to stay for a week but we didn't bring a lot of food. Figured we'd just do some grocery shopping at Darby when needed. Probably find a local pub to dine at a couple of the nights.  
  
After dinner we played one of those spill your secrets or drink games. I don’t remember anything all that embarrassing or revealing from the game. And none of us got drunk. Then we went to bed. I even remember feeling a little bored.  
  
The first thing we noticed in the morning was the car was missing. Stolen, we thought. But none of us had heard anything  during the night and our bedrooms overlook where it had been parked. Then we noticed we had no reception. Well, I had noticed that the previous evening before I went to bed. But it felt truly significant when we wanted to call for the police or the lodge's management. There was also no phone in the lodge. There was a just a socket for where it should have been. None of us had noticed the lack of phone the evening before.  
  
Despite his car having gone missing, Jake stayed positive. Look at the whole thing as an adventure. We all took point from him and tried our best to look forward.   
  
The boys decided they would walk over to Darby and call for help. They didn't take much with them. Some bottles of water. They headed off and as they rounded the corner of the dirt road I could hear Jake and Robert talking jovially.  
  
They didn't come back for hours. I’m not sure exactly how long. Not long after Jake and Robert had left, Janine and I realised both our phones had their time frozen at 2:57am. The microwave time was stuck at 2:53am. It was unsettling, but we didn’t make a great deal of fuss about it. I thought phones were synchronised to satellite time or something? The boys must have left around eight. The sun had just dipped below the trees when they came back. Janine rushed to hug Robert.  He hugged her back, but he wasn't smiling or laughing. Jake kept looking back at the road.  
  
The road doesn't end the boys told us.    
  
We asked them what they meant. They repeated themselves. We asked if it was possible they missed a turn somewhere. They said they walked for several hours. They weren't sure how long since their phone clocks were stuck at 2:57am too. But they judged from the shadows of the trees, it was around midday when they started to think the road had been going on for too long. They turned around and looked for a turn off they had missed. But eventually they found themselves back at the lodge.  
  
It was a sullen night. I heard Janine and Robert arguing a little at some point. I stayed in my room. I don’t know what Jake was doing.  
  
The next morning Jake and Robert got ready to go again. What else could they do? They figured they simply must have just missed a turn off or perhaps, disoriented by their inability to tell the time, they had given up too soon. Janine and I wondered whether we should follow them. But Jake asked us to stay. He made some weak excuses. I can’t even remember what they were. Now when I think about it, I think none of us really wanted to believe what happened the day before. It must have been some unlucky chance. Robert assured us, that they would find the main road and everything would be fine by evening.   
  
But it wasn’t.   
  
They came back just before nightfall. They looked really confused. Really scared. Janine looked like she was about to burst into tears as Robert shook his head, pale faced.  
  
We barely said a word to each other that evening. There wasn’t much food remaining for dinner. Even though I had no appetite, it was alarming. I wanted to ask questions but the boys looked so despondent I didn’t. I'm not sure if Janine spoke to Robert about what had happened that day.    
  
I had such a knot in my stomach I stayed in one of the toilets the whole evening. It was then I noticed the silence. There was no wind. No animals. Not even insect noises. Just the hum of the electric lights. I didn’t sleep well that night.  
  
The next day, the boys did not seem prepared to go out at all. Jake was sitting on the stairs outside just staring at the dirt road once more. Robert looked like he was nursing a headache at the dining table. I had been trying to find a signal all around the lodge. There was none. As I walked past Robert at some point, he told me, “There isn’t any.” I stopped and asked him to clarify. There wasn’t any signal the whole length of road they had walked. They even climbed a tree to espy the surrounding area. Nothing. No radio towers, water towers, nor power lines. Not even a plume of smoke. Just the endless dirt path slowly winding its way through the trees.  
  
Janine appeared then. She looked ready to go. So was I. But for some reason the boys were able to stop us once more. “Third time’s the charm.” and “Just give us a chance to redeem ourselves.” they said. Robert even managed a smile. And off they went, backpacks on like they were going on a relaxing hike. We should have gone.with them. How stupid of us.   
  
It must have been almost noon that they left. As we waited I noticed the microwave clock was no longer showing. The power had cut out. Janine and I wandered around the lodge to understand why, and discovered the lodge ran on a generator round the back. It had run out of fuel.   
  
Evening crawled close.   
  
It was only then we decided we had enough. Janine and I decided we would go after them. We’d just stepped out onto the dirt path when we saw him coming back. Jake. All by himself. We ran up to him calling out. There was clearly something wrong. He was pale, breathing heavily, and his lips were dry and splitting. His clothes were dusty and slightly mud spattered. And he wouldn’t look at us. We asked repeatedly about Robert. But he wouldn’t answer. He just kept stumbling resolutely to the lodge. He got himself a glass of water, gulped it down then collapsed into a dining chair. Then he just stared at the wall as long shadows crept across it.  
  
Janine was besides herself. I don’t blame her. I was frustrated too. He wouldn’t answer us. Just stared straight ahead. The incident with the knife happened in the last moments of twilight. I had gently pulled the knife out of Jake’s shoulder. I remembered from first aid training that you weren’t supposed to pull knives out until you were in a place where bleeding could be controlled. But I didn’t think any ambulance was coming. I found a tea towel and placed it on his shoulder then took his hand to press against it. He didn’t resist me. Just stared at me blinking. I let him be and went to my room.  
  
Night fell. I have never felt so suffocated by darkness and silence. I must have fallen asleep just a little at some point. It was hard to tell whether my eyes were open or not. But I could hear Janine sobbing.   
  
Slowly. Agonizingly slowly, I felt my way out of my room. I followed the wall to Janine’s room, guided by her crying. I knocked gently and whispered to announce my presence. We found each other and held each other tightly. She cried properly on me then. I think I was doing the same.  
  
That helped us find some resilience. We used our phone lights, whose batteries had become very precious, to make our way down to the kitchen. Jake was not sitting there any longer. We didn’t say anything about it to each other. We tried on the stove and to our relief, there was still gas, so it lit up. The blue flames didn’t light much but it was better than the void.   
  
There was a firepit outside. Opening the front door gave me a moment of vertigo. The vastness of the night made me imagine for a moment we stood at the edge of a precipe over an endless chasm. In the stale cold air, the abyss felt never ending. We decided to once more use our phones to navigate. We found a stick in the pit, lit it up at the stove, and then back to the firepit. I was very grateful for Janine’s campfire skills for she soon had a decent fire going. We shared a blanket sitting against a log near the fire.   
  
I was about to drift back into sleep when Janine mumbled something. I roused. “What is it?”  
  
“Stars,” she said, “There are no stars.” I looked up. Just an ocean of endless black. A cloud cover, I said aloud. She nodded. I think she was trying to believe me. I think I was trying to believe myself.  
  
I woke up this morning at the crack of dawn. The faintest grey in the east. My body was tired, but a surge of adrenaline took me. Janine was still asleep. I espied Jake in his room curled up on a bed. I packed everything I think we could need into a couple of backpacks we brought. It wasn’t much. I ruefully remembered there had been a torch in Robert’s car. But there’s not much point in those thoughts now.   
  
I’m writing this just waiting for the others to get up. We’re getting out of here. All three of us. I hope my next update will be written somewhere far away from here.
