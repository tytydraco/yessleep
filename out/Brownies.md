Have you ever heard of Brownies? The creature, not the desert, although I wish that was what we were dealing with.

According to my friend, Brownies are little fantasy creatures that secretly run everything behind the scenes. She told me about them because it did seem like Brownies could be behind it. At first.

Honestly, at first it was kind of nice. Things were suddenly organized when I know I wasn’t the one who organized them, I would wake up every morning to find the dishes washed and put away, and things that had been broken that I had been putting off fixing were being fixed on their own. I had no idea what was going on- I live alone so there shouldn’t be anyone in the house to do these things. Whatever it was though, it was helpful, so I wasn’t exactly complaining.

These things started to grow more frequent however, it seems anything I didn’t finish was always finished for me once I left the room. And I mean *everything*. Like I said, it was kind of nice at first, but after a while, with more and more things being done, it started to creep me out a little. So, I decided to put up cameras, to try to catch how these things were happening. I got the uncomfortable feeling that I was always being watched a few weeks after it started, so I decided to figure out why.

The strangest thing, after I put the cameras up, it stopped. My chores and tasks stopped being completed for me and I no longer felt like I was being watched. After a full week of nothing, I took the cameras down out of curiosity, and immediately, the “Brownies” came back. It continued like this for a while, it seemed wherever I set up cameras, no matter how inconspicuous, that area would go back to normal, and whenever I took the cameras back down, it would start happening again. Clearly, whatever it was that was doing this, it didn’t want to be seen.

One day, I had called Alice over, my friend who had told me about Brownies in the first place, to make cookies for her older sister’s wedding. Alice’s kitchen was bigger, but she insisted that she wanted to see the “Brownies” in real life, and although I told her that I had never actually seen anything, she insisted.

“I’m so excited, Jane!” Alice had told me, “I’m gonna she a Brownie! In real life!”

“There’s no Brownies, Alice.” I had told her back, even though I had no idea what else it could be. “Besides, I’ve never even seen them, so I doubt that’s going to change with two people here.” Alice made a face at me and started going through my cupboards, looking for ingredients.

We just put our first batch in the oven when Alice excused herself to the restroom. As soon as she left, I got a call from my younger brother.

“Hey Karter, what’s up?”

“Uh, yeah hi Jane, um…”

“Is everything okay?”

“Were you… in my apartment, by any chance?”

My heart skipped a beat. “What? No, why would I be in your apartment? Did something happen? Did someone break in?”

“Well, I’m not really sure, exactly…”

Karter had a habit of messing with me, so normally I wouldn’t be this concerned, but with what I had been experiencing lately, I was a little more on edge then normal.

“It’s just..” Karter continued, struggling to comprehend what he was saying. “I got home yesterday and my stuff was a mess. Papers and books scattered everywhere, my clothes were thrown all around the entire house, and… there were footprints.”

Silence. I heard Karter take a shaky breath.

“What kind of footprints?” I asked.

More silence.

“Karter? Hello? What kind of footprints?”

“Are you home?” He finally asked. It was barely a whisper. I had never heard so much fear in his voice.

“Karter? Yes, I’m home. What’s going on?”

It sounded like he was silently sobbing, finally he just whispered, with more fear in his voice than ever, “Can you come over?”

The cookies had two minutes left in the oven, I saw something out of the corner of my eye, so subtle I didn’t even consciously register it, but I knew in the back of my mind that they wouldn’t burn as I grabbed my keys and purse, I vaguely noticed a note on the counter in my handwriting. I didn’t know what it said, but I didn’t care as I raced out the door, my car was unlocked and running, which had happened a few times before when I was in a rush. I knew the “Brownies” were at work, making sure I was able to get to Karter’s apartment as fast as possible. That should have been worrying, especially because, why on earth would these things want to help me? I didn’t even check the note. I had no idea what it said. That was a fatal mistake. Because these “Brownies” had been so *helpful* before, I just assumed they were being nice out of the kindness of their hearts? Stars, I was an idiot.

I sped all the way to Karter’s apartment, where I was surprised to find him outside in the parking lot. When he saw me, he ran full speed like he used to when he was younger.

“Jane! Jane I’m so glad you’re here!” He grabbed my arm, and I could tell he was shaking.

“Karter! Are you okay? What happened?”

Karter took another shaky breath and turned to look at his apartment. “It was there, Jane, it- it was *right there*!” I could tell he was having a hard time keeping it together. “It was *touching* me, Jane. It had its head on my shoulder, it was looking at me!”

I could feel my blood getting colder. “What? What do you mean? What was?”

“I don’t know!” He whispered. “I didn’t look at it, I was afraid that if I did, I would see something that I was never meant to see.”

What Karter was describing to me wasn’t what bothered me the most. I think I knew that we were dealing with the same creatures, although I didn’t consider the implications of that yet. Sure, it was bad, it sounded terrifying, but it was just how absolutely *petrified* Karter sounded that made my blood turn to ice. Karter didn’t just *get scared*, he never freaked out. Even that time when we were kids and we got lost in the woods, the sun started setting and I started crying because I was afraid that we would never find our way out, but Karter, three years younger than me, at six years old, forged ahead with confidence and resolve that I could never hope to mimic.

But this *fear* in his voice.. That was new. And somehow the most unsettling thing about the whole situation.

“What do you mean by that? Nevermind. It’s alright. Is… is it still there? In your apartment?”

“I don’t know.” He whispered again, followed by, “I think so.”

I tried to steady my breathing. I figured we couldn’t call the police just yet because we weren’t sure what exactly it was that we were dealing with, which meant…

“Okay, okay, Karter, I’m going to go inside to check it out, okay?”

“What? No, no, Jane, you can’t go in there!” It bothered me how much he seemed genuinely concerned for my life, but when he saw that I had made up my mind, he deflated a little. “I’ll go with you.” he said quietly.”

“You don’t have to do that.”

“I’m going with you!”

…

“Okay.”

We made our way up to the apartment, the door was closed, but unlocked. I went inside first, with Karter following closely behind. Just as he had told me over the phone, my brother's apartment was a mess. Looking down, I saw the footprints he had been talking about. They were vaguely human shaped, but a bit smaller, like they were from a child. But the shape was a little off, the toes were too long and the heel was too narrow. It looked like when you walk barefoot over a floor that had just been mopped, at least, that’s the only way I can describe it. It wasn’t just one set of footprints either, they were all over, like whatever these *things* were, there were several of them, walking all around.

“Am I going crazy,” Karter asked, “Or are some of those handprints?” Looking more closely, I realized he was right. It was hard to distinguish the feet from the hands, but the longer I looked, the more clear I saw that some of them had four fingers and a long thumb. Did these things walk on all fours?

“Oh stars.” Karter breathed.

“What?” I asked.

“They’re on the ceiling as well.”

“What?” I looked up and saw that once again, he was right. The hand and foot prints were… *everywhere.* The walls, the ceiling, tables, chairs, even some of the couches had faint marks. 

“What… ?” Karter seemed at a loss for words as we made our way through the house.

“Maybe I should call Alice.” I said. “See if she has anything to say about this.”

Normally Karter thought Alice was a bit of a moron, but this time, he just nodded his head. “Yeah, maybe she will.”

I think we were both secretly hoping Alice’s crazy fantasy stories were true for once as I called her phone. It rang for a while before going to voicemail.

“That’s weird. She was just with me. We were making cookies at my house.”

“That is weird.” Karter said. “Did anything strange happen today? Any… ‘*brownies’*?”

I almost dropped my phone as realization hit me. Karter knew about the things that had been happening at my house. Okay, call us idiots for not making the connection sooner, but the “brownies” had seemed so *docile* for me, and so *hostile* for Karter, I honestly didn’t think the same creature could have done this but… The note…

It all clicked into place a second before I heard the door shut. It didn’t slam or anything, just softly closed. Me and Karter whipped around at the same time. We saw nothing, but I suddenly got the feeling that I wasn’t alone. That I was being *watched*. It was the same feeling I had been getting at home. Karter slowly turned his head upwards. I tried to look up too when something grabbed me from behind, placing its hands over my eyes and dragging me to the floor. I heard Karter scream as I was forced onto my stomach with something digging into my back, I could see again but all I had was a blurry image of the floor as my head was violently pulled back and slammed into the floor. I felt the pain of my nose breaking as I lost consciousness almost instantly.





I woke up on the floor. Not my or Karter’s floor, but *a* floor. My vision was blurry, my ears were ringing, my whole body hurt, and I could taste the blood from my nose dripping into my mouth. I sat up with difficulty and gently bumped something behind me. I really don’t know what I was thinking, I don’t think I was, to be honest, but I turned around.

I was face to face with it. Two inches from mine, its eyes were enormous, it’s skin was disgusting and clammy, It didn’t smile, it just stared with these wide eyes. It sat perfectly still in a frog-like position.

Words cannot describe what I felt in that moment. I was paralyzed. My blood was frozen. I couldn't breathe. My body wanted to shake so bad but it couldn’t move, so I felt like I was vibrating from the cold. The air around me wasn’t even chilly, in fact, it didn’t really have a temperature.

Suddenly, it scurried away, into the darkness and out of sight, It was quick. Too quick.  I felt a chill go down my spine. It was then that I became aware of a sound that had been present the whole time, I had just been too shaken up and afraid to notice it before. The sound was muffled, it sounded like someone was being gagged and sobbing quietly. I felt sick to my stomach. I turned again and almost threw up and passed out at the same time when I saw where the sound was coming from.

His bones were broken at all the joints, one stood behind him, its arms under his, holding him up. Another one had his head tilted back, so he was looking straight up. It was trying to shove its arm down his throat.

The sound was horrible, and saying I felt physically ill was an understatement. My mouth hung open slightly as I took in the sight. The sounds started fading a little, getting weaker as I heard and watched my brother die horrifically in real time. Finally, it pulled its arm out. I won’t even describe what I saw as Karter’s stomach was ripped out through his mouth. His jaw had already been broken, but it had been ripped open wider and wider as these *things* attempted to rip his organs out through his mouth.

Karter was dead at this point, a person couldn't physically survive this. I watched as another one cut a deep slit in his wrist and tried to pull his arm bone out. It violently bent his wrist in several directions until the carpus was completely disconnected from the radius and ulna. Another one was doing the same thing with his other arm, and two more with his legs and ankles. The one at his throat was being highly efficient as the mess grew larger. These things were smaller than a person, and as the bones were removed from his limbs, it tried to crawl inside.

Up until now, I had been too terrified to move. But seeing these things trying to wear my brother's skin like a suit was too much. I stood up and bolted in the opposite direction. I tried to take note of my surroundings as I ran, but everything was a blur. I caught movement off to the side and glanced to see what it was. Next thing I knew, I was tumbling down a staircase. I had noticed the staircase when I was approaching it, but…

Okay, where the heck am I? What’s going on? What in Tartarus were these things? I hit my head on a corner and blacked out again.





A week later, I was driving to visit Alice at the mental hospital. People said that she had gone completely insane, saying things about brownies wearing her skin and how if you open your mouth too wide, your organs will be ripped out.

She knows about Karter. She’s the only other person that knows, and I really don’t know how. She wasn’t there when Karter died. I think something must have happened to her after I left the house that day. When I woke up in bed after hitting my head, she was already there. I’ve tried to ask her about it, but she hasn’t given me a coherent answer.

Karter was reported missing that day. His friend apparently stopped by his apartment and found it a mess. When no one could get a hold of him, they called the police. The footprints  weren’t found. The reason no one had tried to call me was because of the note. It was in my handwriting, saying that my friend had gotten into a bad car accident and needed me to pick her up, so I would be gone awhile and probably wouldn’t answer my phone because she was in a location with bad service. The strange thing is, that friend *did* get in an accident. She was knocked out, so she couldn’t confirm whether or not I had actually been there. How she got to the hospital, I have no idea. I don’t think anyone really knows what’s going on right now. They’re still searching for Karter, even though I know he’s gone. Alice knows it too.
