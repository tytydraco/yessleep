I’m not allowed to read last week’s update, but you can:

In front of me sits a tea cup filled with Borax, milk, and a half shot of my spit. 

The pale, leather-skinned crone hovers over it analysing the concoction’s look and smell. After a minute or so, she leans back in her chair, looking smug. 

"It's healthy, it's a boy, and it'll take after yourself, if you understand what I'm saying.", she says with a look that seems to see through me. 

She wears an oversized pair of ancient jeans, and a plaid shirt long enough to be a dress should the need arise. A Johnny Cash hat casts a shadow over her ancient face. 

She's not the most stereotypical witch I've seen, but she's one of the most powerful. 

"Thank you.", I reply, handing over a handful of 100 dollar bills, "And I trust this stays between us?"

The crone leers, teeth too white. 

"Sure, sure. For an additional price, of course.", she extorts. 

I'd seen this coming, but hope she doesn't ask for much more. The other $200 I hand her drains the last of my share of our funds. 

She takes the money, and makes a zipping motion across her lips, then mimes throwing away a key. 

In case anyone hasn't figured things out yet, it's Sveta. Currently feeling scared and hopeful in equal amounts. 

I exit the almost hidden door into an alley that seems out of an 80's anti-drug PSA. 

As I try and exit the dank alcove, two men step from the shadows. Large, masked, and by their smell, related to the woman I was just talking to. 

They don't bother to hide their oversized knives, one even holds out a set of handcuffs. 

"Don't make us do this the hard way. I don't want to have to try and sell damaged goods.", the taller of the two says. 

The hooded leather jackets they wear are decorated with small bones and other trophies. The apples don't seem to have fallen very far from the tree. 

All things being equal, I could consume these two without a thought. But having had my suspicions confirmed, I'm not going to risk changing.

"Boys, your mom just made 2k for a minute of work, and ten cents worth of detergent. 

Can we not?", I ask. 

They both chuckle, the one on the left shakes his handcuffs at me. 

"You two really must want to end up as chew toys.", I threaten. 

Another chuckle from the two kidnappers. 

"You won't change. Now put on these fucking cuffs before I decide it's easier to sell you piecemeal .", is the response I get. 

A silhouette appears behind the two men. Dimming the already scant light of the alley. 

They don't notice, both are focussed on their payday. Either too stupid or confidant to be wary. 

"Anything I can do to get you two to leave me alone?", I ask. 

The form behind them is tall, grinning, and wearing a black and yellow clown suit filled with newly acquired ways of doing harm. 

"Bitch, in about five minutes, I'm going to have you doing everything. Why the hell would I leave you alone?", the one on the right says. 

The disgusting threat is like a switch.

 Before the two take their first step, Mike reaches from behind, grabbing them both by the groin. Tendons stand out on his hand as he squeezes with all his strength. 

The men scream at first, weapons and handcuffs hitting the ground. Mike puts his head between the two. 

"Quiet now. If mommy comes out that door, the last thing you're going to see is me force feeding her your meat and two veg. 

By the feel of things, I've mashed one potato a piece. I say that's a fair price for threatening my friend the way you did.

Here's where you two get to decide:

Do you lose the rest of your junk, or do you crawl away and lick your wounds?

I'd tell you to think hard on it, but I'm not much for puns.", Mike snarls, further twisting his hands. 

Deflated, both figuratively and literally, the two make the smart choice. 

I take Mike on a winding path through the city, trying to process what I just learned. 

"Do I get to know what this was all about? Or why we’re keeping it a secret?", Mike asks. 

I pause, not really knowing where to start. I eventually decide to just be blunt. 

"I'm pregnant.", I nearly whisper.

"That's awesome. If we survive this, that's a pretty good memento of JP.", Mike replies with genuine joy. 

"...it's not his.", I say, quietly. 

"Oh, Leo then? No judgements, you've known him for a while and we've all been going through some shit. 

Mazel-tov.", Mike replies. 

"Not him either...", I lead.

"Okay. So it's not me, can't be Punch. Jesus Christ, Demi?", Mike says, shocked. 

"What? Fuck no, god, that's awful. 

And for the record, if it was any of us, it would be Punch.

Human Punch anyway. 

No, it just kind of happened when I got here.", I admit.

"Immaculate conception? Why not? I guess.

So, why did we have to come down here to crime alley?", Mike asks. 

"I needed to know what was growing inside of me. I didn't trust this place not to have me birth some kind of demon.", I answer. 

"And you trust the old lady?", Mike inquires. 

"Didn't have to. Everything smells different when it lies.", I reply. 

"I'm guessing this explains why you haven't been able to Wolf-out?", Mike guesses. 

"Wolf-out, really? Never use that again. 

But, yes. If I change I'd lose the child.", I explain. 

"So, why keep Leo in the dark?", Mike sounds confused. 

I take a bit to reply. 

"I'm thinking about staying, and I don't want him worrying that I'm not all in for finding the Bishop.", I say. 

"Seems like a lamb choosing to stay in the Lion exhibit. This place doesn't seem kind to people like you.", Mike postulates. 

"I know. But I have no idea what the trip back to reality could do to me. If I have a chance to do something to help my kind, I have to take it.", I admit.

We pass a corner store ran by a wispy purple humanoid with hands like antennae. 

"That's a short family tree.", Mike muses. 

"...Do you just think of the worst possible scenario?

Roughly one in ten thousand chance of a werewolf and a human having a werewolf child. I have another couple hundred years or so before I can't have kids any more.

This child would keep that hope alive, he’d have a few millennia to get us back in the gene pool. It’s not much, but it’s a chance.  

Now, any more questions about paranormal obstetrics?.", I ask. 

Mike laughs. 

"There's a lot of 'Maybe', in your plan. But, your secret is safe with me. 

Just don't expect me to come visit.", Mike jokes. 

"Why not? This place seems right up your alley.", I say motioning to the general macabre atmosphere of the city. 

"Not at all. 

This shithole needs to be burned to the ground. I'm not stupid enough to think I can pull that off, so putting it in the 'pretend this didn't happen' folder is the next best thing.", Mike clarifies. 

Later that day, all of us, minus Punch find ourselves sitting around a table in Agnus’ bar. 

"Anyone else wondering where Punch is?", Leo asks. He cuts into a steak of dubious origins and freshness. 

"I'm sure he's fine.", Demi replies absently. 

"Well, if Jack the Ripper isn't worried, case closed then. 

 That being said, we can't wait around forever for him. The Bishop is getting farther away every minute. We'll go looking later.

I trust everyone has gotten themselves set up for the trip?", Leo questions. 

We all reply in the affirmative. 

It's a half hour of nearly silent eating. This close to the finish line, we’re all having our worries and doubts. 

"What on earth happened to you two?", Demi exclaims. 

Herman walks in, Punch in tow. They both look like they've lost a fight with a band-saw. 

Herman is missing one ear and a good portion of the flesh around it, and Punch is missing his whole left arm from the elbow down. 

"Welcome to the club.", Leo says, raising his missing hand. 

"Went out looking for the Bishop, got myself captured by some cannibal types. Thankfully Herman caught wind of it and saved my ass. 

Didn't come out unharmed, but after the spoils of war, he came out ahead enough to fully grease some wheels. We've got a line on the bishop, and the means to catch him just as he's leaving the city. 

All thanks to your friend, Demi.", Punch says. 

I know he's lying, but I don't want to believe that. He's here, I might not trust Herman, but I trust Punch.

"Hot damn, let's go shit on his parade then!", Mike exclaims.

Punch has a look on his face like he swallowed a bug.

"Not quite that simple.", Punch says.

"Why not?", Mike replies impatiently.

"Collateral damage.

The Bishop has had just as much time to prepare and figure things out as we have. Whatever happens between him and us, it's going to be nasty.

I don't want us getting rid of the Bishop, just to piss off a dozen bigger, nastier things here.

From what Herman says, the path to the void is pretty much barren. Makes sense as you have to be pretty top tier insane to want to make the trip.

We hit him tomorrow, after he's put some distance between himself and the city.

Everyone agree?", Punch asks.

We do. We've been waiting nearly a year for this to wrap up, what's another night?

We spend the next hour planning, and talking. We're excited, but beneath that, we're all nervous. Us winning isn't some forgone conclusion.

A door opens, and the tavern goes silent.

Heavy footsteps, the rattling of metal objects.

"Aggie, a little birdie told me that one of my cousins from the mundane parts of the universe is staying here.

Where can I find him?" ,a voice says. It’s low and harsh.

Agnus pauses, this alone is enough to get our attention. In our brief time here, the stout, fierce woman hasn't shown a second of fear.

"I don't keep tabs like that on my customers Travis, you know that. But if I hear anything I'll let you know.", Agnus replies. She's a bad liar.

I turn toward the confrontation. 

Travis isn't a large man, average height and build. But there's a power about him. 

He wears large brown workboots, a three-quarter length beige duster, and has a grip tape wrapped crowbar-like tool strapped to his back like a sword. His hair is short and black with the first signs of grey. 

He's flanked by two women, twins, or at least sisters. They're both pale, with bright blue eyes and several suspect profiles hidden under designer jackets. 

"Aggie, I like you, hell, even the girls like you, and they hate everyone. 

But you know how I react to being lied to. 

I'm going to ask again. And this time, really take your time in answering. 

Where's the hero?", Travis snarls. 

Agnus looks scared, but she remains silent. 

"Well, I’m not going to like doing this, but...", Travis begins, moving to draw his odd weapon. 

Leo stands, forcing a smile onto his face. 

"You hear the voice?", he asks Travis. 

Travis turns to Leo, looking him up and down before replying, "From within and without.".

The two embrace with a quick, forceful hug that makes me think of cops or soldiers. 

"What brings a man like yourself here?", Travis asks Leo, making a show of eying up our group. 

"Seems like I should be asking you that. 

I always though the Deans were a myth.", Leo replies. 

Travis laughs. 

"We like to use it to scare kids into behaving back home, don't we?

No, brother, we're real. Just rare. 

Been a while since ol' Jimmy has been alive though.", Travis says.

"Learn something new every day. 

I've been hunting a real piece of work. Wants to try riling up the void. Calls himself the Bishop, you haven't heard of him, have you?", Leo asks. 

"Bishop? That must make you Elmer's kid, right? The one that fucked off?", Travis locks eyes with Leo, gauging his barb's effect.  

Leo remains calm. 

"Not the way that I'd put things, but I'm Elmer's son.", Leo answers. 

"He was a good man, sorry to hear about him passing. 

Now, to get to business. 

We're a little on the short staffed side of things, and we're going to need you to lend us a hand.", Travis says. 

"No can do right now. I'm within spitting distance of catching up with the Bishop. 

If I make it back to the city, I'll see what I can do though.", Leo replies diplomatically. 

Travis laughs, and looks to his companions shaking his head. 

"This guy.", Travis begins, "This isn't a request Lenny. This is what you'd call a direct order."

There's tension, the two men stare at each other, the bar is silent, motionless. 

"I've never been good at following orders. Seems like you know that though. 

I'm not going to judge you and yours. But anyone who lives here, doesn't hold any rank I recognize.", Leo replies. 

Travis sneers. The air is thick with the threat of violence.

"You're talking like I’m an apostate. 

Some might take offense to that. 

Things are hard here, and once you're done tilting at your windmill, you get to go back to the cushy part of reality. Where you have to search for a month to find something void touched enough to kill. 

Us? We'll still be here, in the trenches. 

I see who you surround yourself with, I know how you abandoned your post. In fact, I know your whole narcissistic, myopic, blood soaked history. You owe the cause.  

So I'm going to ask one more time. You plan on heeding your oath, or no?", Travis growls. 

The two men are inches from each other and by the smell of things seconds away from blows. 

"What I do or don't have to atone for is none of your fucking business. 

Is it true you guys don't even hear the call down here? 

Doesn't make sense to me, ever since I’ve got here, it's been screaming at me. 

A smart man would get the message. 

You can start giving me orders once you start hearing the call again, brother. Till then, stay the hell out of my way.", Leo replies. 

We all look to each other, wondering if we need to step in. 

The two men smell like sweat and testosterone. Travis' lip twitches. 

But like a switch, suddenly his face softens and he claps Leo on the shoulder. 

"Well, I tried. No harm, no foul. 

Just, before I leave though. Remember something, whenever god closes a door, he opens a window.

Nice meeting you all. Best of luck.", Travis says, him and his cohorts leaving. 

"I don't like him.", Alex says. 

"Fair call.", Demi adds.

Slowly the bar's collective sphincter unclenches. Drinks are imbibed, conversations brew, and plans are made. 

Hours later, we are close to calling it a night. Mike is carrying the last round of drinks, when suddenly, he drops them. 

Worn glass shatters on the ground, Mike runs at Leo, tackling him from his chair. 

In that same instant, a massive furrow digs itself out of the table in front of us. 

My brain tries to make sense out of the sudden input. Torn between the ruptured table and Mike's sudden attack. 

Alex's head rocks backward, she's thrown out of her chair. She lays on the ground, face scorched, dazed but fine. 

The people behind her weren't so lucky. As I hear the cacophonic gunshot, a dozen or so are hit with bullet fragments.  

Time seems to unfreeze, my mind starts making the connections. I hit the ground, joining my friends as we look to each other confused and scared. 

Gunshots, scattered at first, but eventually gaining momentum. Pieces of the bar pop and shatter in the lead rain. 

"Mother fucker!", Leo screams. 

"What the hell do we do now?", I ask. 

"We need to get out of here. They're out there in force. Christ, I wish I knew how many were out there.", Leo laments. 

Despite the destruction, death and chaos around me, what catches my attention is Punch. 

He sits upright and cross legged, taking cover with the rest of us under the table. A far off look on his face.

"Not the time to go catatonic on us Punch!", Mike yells.

Punch raises one finger in a 'give me a second' gesture. 

"He's went round the bend.", Demi says, a stray bullet taking a  bloody chunk out of his shoulder.  The fact I see real pain on his face tells me the hunters brought their best tools.

"Give him time.", Leo demands. A hint of curiosity in his voice. 

"There's about sixty of the bastards, give or take. Most are out front, but they have people set up all around. 

They're angry, they're desperate, and being in this place has twisted them. ", Punch says confidently.

A bullet hits the ground in front of Punch. He doesn't flinch, just keeps sitting there while the rest of us are belly down on the ground. 

"You have any more intel Punch?", Leo asks. 

"The one's who've been here longer are cut off from whatever gives you power. But they have plenty of new recruits. 

There's a lot I just don't understand, but things are looking pretty bad.", Punch says, lowering himself. 

"Herman, we need to get out of the city, post haste. I assume the vehicles you were offering are at your hotel?", Demi asks. 

"Who said anything about a vehicle? The road to the void isn't exactly well paved. 

I've procured some creatures that can be somewhat accurately described as equine.", Herman replies. 

"Fuck me, horses? Really? This keeps getting better.", Mike says. 

"How accurate can you pinpoint these blackguards?", Leo inquires. 

"I can see what's coming around the corner, but that's about it. I'm still working out the kinks with what I can do.", Punch answers. 

"Okay, better than nothing I guess. 

We go to the hotel, and set out tonight, Get ahead of the Bishop.", Leo suggests. 

"Assuming we even make it there.", I add.  

"What about the people here?", Alex asks.

Sometimes I forget she's just a kid. 

"Sweetheart, if we stay and fight, the Bishop is going to get away. We'll die. So will a lot of innocent people.

A handful of folks like Leo can destroy a species. There's fifty out there. ", I answer. Saying it out loud makes my heart sink.

We start to crawl toward the kitchen doors. Sounds of violence and chaos all around us. 

The fucking cowards aren't even storming the place. Just unloading what seems like an army worth of gunfire from the safety of the street. 

A body hits the ground in front of me, from the shoulders up is nothing more than a scorched mass of flesh. 

"We can get to the alley from the kitchen, if anyone has a plan for once we're out of here, I'd love to hear it.", Leo says. 

None of us do. 

Everything in me is screaming to turn and fight. To show these god damned poachers what a legend can do. But I can't. And even if I could, fifty hunters would be one hell of a fight. 

There’s the sound of shattering glass, too loud to be anything mundane. Then, a sudden heat from behind us. 

The screams get so loud they're painful. 

We make it to the kitchen, thick, black smoke is starting to foul the air. 

None of us need to say it, we feel like cowards. Skulking out of the backdoor isn't the most heroic action. 

Alex is taking it the worst. Despite the horror she's been through, this is the first time she is seeing what a real hard choice is. 

We pause before the door to the alley, steeling ourselves for whatever we find on the other side. 

It seems we have a rare moment of good luck. To our left is a clear path down the long, cluttered alleyway. 

Before we can take our first steps to freedom, a shrill whistle from behind us loud enough to crack a handful of windows catches our attention.

Travis stands at the opposite end of the alley, holding a thick chain leading to a rune inscribed collar. 

"Hey Leo, how do you like my window?", Travis taunts, slapping the flank of a massive creature. 

With six legs and three heads it stands taller than a brown bear. It's eyes burn like embers in the dark alley, putrid grey mist seeps from dripping snouts. 

It's at least two tons of muscle, clawed legs already digging pits into the ground. 

A hellhound. 

"Get, 'em", Travis screams with a twisted grin, letting go of the leash. 

"Run!", Leo screams.

We don't need to be told twice.

I feel useless, impotent. If I could change, I could turn around and command the hellhound to tear Travis apart. But in my case control comes from domination as much as status, and I’m not commanding any respect as I am now. 

The tight alley slows the creature, it's bone spined shoulders catching on errant pipes and debris. But it's two tons of paranormal infused muscle, some bricks and pipes are not going to stop it. 

Our lungs burn as we sprint, the nonsensical architecture of this place making it seem like the end of the alley is getting no closer. 

With every passing second the hellhound gains momentum, boiling saliva hits the ground as it anticipates it's kill. 

We're panicked , scared, and in a situation where there aren't many options other than run and hope. 

A howl that’s half scream and the alley lights up. Flames scorch our backs, I swat at my head to put out burning embers. 

"This isn't working!", Mike screams, vaulting over a crate. 

Leo turns, firing a few shots at the hound from a handgun. They ricochete and bounce down the alley. 

The chase starts to turn into a war of attrition, the end of the alley seemingly refusing to get any closer.

Smoke pours from the exit to Agnus' place, the Hellhound bursting through the opaque cloud is a horrifying sight. 

"It's gaining on us!", I scream. 

Like my statement was a command, Alex stops dead. 

Punch, Mike, Demi, Herman and Leo are ahead of her, they don't notice. 

"Alex, get moving!", I yell. 

She doesn't reply. 

I'm panicked, frozen by fear. I can't leave her, but I can't help. 

The sound of the hellhound crashing into her is like a train-wreck. The momentum of tons of demonic flesh being stopped by a force as strong as itself cracks brick and sends debris scattering. 

While Alex is fearful in her own right, the image of her holding the massive beast makes me feel proud for a moment. 

The rest of our companions turn, curses ring out as they take in the situation. 

If this was just some animal, Alex likely would have just been able to tire it out. Let it's instinct to dominate and prove it's power be it's downfall. 

But hellhounds are old, they survive in some of the worst parts of reality. Beyond that animalistic exterior, there's more than cunning, there's wisdom. 

The creature suddenly turns it's head, capturing Alex's torso in it's massive jaws. Bone plates shatter, blood sprays, the child-like sound of Alex's scream is almost too much to bear. 

Leo and Mike are firing at the Hellhound now, and much like the waves of sickly black energy coming from a ring on Demi's right hand, it's having no effect. 

Screams turn to mewling as Alex's body separates, her twisted anatomy keeping her on the brink of death. Her upper half is trying vainly to crawl away. 

Fear, hatred and shock hit us like a tidal wave. We threaten, scream and curse. 

It's all we can do as the Hellhound takes a massive, phlegmatic inhale. 

The flames are pure red, they bathe Alex and the area around her. Stone, brick and steel turn to liquid. Garbage, and part of a building turning into a molten slurry of slag and body parts. 

The canine turns toward us, a look of horrific intellect behind it's six eyes. The slag behind it glows, bathing the alley in a foul glow. I can see one of Alex's hands, fingers blackened, fused with the mess. 

I'd say I’m going to end things here, but I don't think I'm the one who is ending anything. 

I hope there's a next a time, but I don't have much faith there will be. 

If not, thank all of you who have stayed with us so far. You're family. 

Sveta.
