Sitting in a bar with my buddy Roger, I kept trying to convince him that I was in fact, saved by an angel, but he remains a skeptic. “I’m telling you, man, it wasn’t just luck, an old man that appeared out of nowhere grabbed me out of the fire!” I repeated myself.

“No way, bro, I was there with you… There was no old man… I’m telling you, you probably rolled away, and that’s how you got off eas…” He countered.

“Easy, you call this easy, motherfucker?” I pointed at my scarred face and neck.  

“In one piece, I mean… Alive… Shit… I’m sorry…” he turned away, clearly upset.

“I’m just fucking wit’cha, man, it’s all good…” I took my injuries in stride. Never looked great anyway, so what the hell. Now I can brag to the ladies that I’ve battle scars. Not that it worked thus far.

“Son of a bitch, you got me again!” Roger slammed his hand into the counter; I could only laugh at his naivete. For such a good guy, he was a model fucking soldier. A bloody Terminator on the battlefield, and I’m glad he’s on our side. Dealing with this type of emotionless killing machine would’ve been a pain in the ass.

“Old man, you say…” an elderly guy interjected into our conversation.

“Pardon?”

“I sure as hell hope you haven’t made a deal with the devil, son,” he continued, without looking at us.

“Oh great, another one of these superstitious hicks! Lemme guess, you took miraculously survived in the Nam or, was it Korea, old man?” Roger interrupted.

“Don’t matter, boy. Just like you two, I’ve lost a part of myself to the war.” The old man retorted, turning toward us.

His face was scarred, and one of his eyes was blind. He raised an arm, revealing an empty sleeve.

“That, I lost in the war, long before you two were born. The rest, I gave up to the Devil.” He explained calmly. “He demanded Hope to save my life, not thinking much of it while bleeding out from a mine that tore off an arm and a leg, I took the bargain.” The old man explained.

“Oh, fuck this, another vet who’s lost it, and you lot call me a psycho!” Roger got up from his chair, frustrated, “I’m going to take a shit and then I’m leaving. I’m sick of this place and all of these ghost stories.”

The old man wouldn’t even look at him, “there are things you kids can’t wrap your heads around…” he exhaled sharply before sipping from his drink.

Roger got up and left, and I apologized to the old man for his behavior. I’m not gonna lie, his tale caught my attention, so I asked him to tell me all about it.

“You sure you wanna listen to the ramblings of an old man, kid?” he questioned with a half smile creeping on his face.

“Positive, sir.”

“Well then, it ain’t a pretty story, I’ve got to tell. Boy, everything started when my unit encountered an old man chained up in a shack. He was old, hairy, skin and bones, really. Practically wearing a death mask. He didn’t ask to be freed, surprisingly enough, only to be drenched in water. So feeling generous, the boys filled up a few buckets lying around him full of water and showered em'. He just howled in ecstasy while we laughed our asses off. Unfortunately, we were unable to figure out who the fuck he was or how he got there; clearly from his predicament and appearance, he wasn’t a local. We were ambushed, and by the time the fighting stopped, he just vanished. As if he never existed.

“None of us could make sense of it at the time, maybe it was a collective trick of the mind, maybe the chains were just weak… Fuck knows… I know now better, but hindsight is always twenty-twenty. Should’ve left him to rot there…”

I watched the light begin to vanish from his eyes. I wanted to stop him, but he just kept on speaking.

“Sometime later, we were caught in another ambush and I stepped on a mine… as I said, lost an arm and a leg, a bunch of my brothers died there, I’m sure you understand.” He quipped, looking into my eyes. And I did in fact understand.

“So as I said, this man – this devil, he appeared to me still old, still skeletal, but full of vigor this time. Fully naked, like some Herculean hero, but shrouded in darkness and smoke, riding a pitch-black horse. I thought this was the end. And it should’ve been. He was wielding a spear. He stood over me as I watched myself bleed out and offer me life for Hope.

“I wish I wasn’t so stupid, I wish I had let myself just die, but instead, I reached out and grabbed onto the leg of the horse. The figure smiled, revealing a black hole lurking inside its maw. He took my answer for a yes.”

Tears began rolling in the old man’s eyes…

“You can stop, sir, it’s fine… I think I’ve heard enough…”

He wouldn’t listen.

“No, son, it’s alright, I just hope you haven’t made the same mistakes as I had,” he continued, through the very obvious anguish.

“Anyway, as my vision began to dim, I watched the Faustian dealer raise his spear – followed by a crushing pain that knocked the air out of my lungs, only to ignite an acidic flame that burned through my whole body. It was the worst pain I’ve felt. It lasted only about a second, but I’ve never felt this much pain since, not even during my heart attack. Not even close, thankfully it was over become I lost my mind in this infernal sensation.”

“Jesus fucking Christ”, I muttered, listening to the sincerity in his voice.

“I wish, boy, I wish… but it seems like I’m here only to suffer, should’ve been gone a long time ago.” He laughed, half honestly.

“I’m so sorry, Sir…”

“Eh, nothing to apologize for, anyway, that wasn’t the end, you see, after everything went dark. I found myself lying in a smoldering pit. Armless and legless, practically immobile. Listening to the sound of dog paws scraping the ground. Thinking this was it and that I was in hell, I braced myself for the worst. An eternity of torture.

“Sometimes, I wish it turned out this way, unfortunately, no. It was only a dream. A very painful, very real dream. Maybe it wasn’t actually a dream, maybe my soul was transported elsewhere, where I end up being eaten alive. Torn limb from limb by a pack of vicious dogs made of brimstone and hellfire.

“It still happens every now and again, even today, somehow. You see, these dogs that tear me apart, and feast on my spilling inside as I watch helplessly as they devour me whole; skin, muscle, sinew, and bone. Leaving me to watch my slow torture and to feel every bit of the agony that I can’t even describe in words. Imagine being shredded very slowly while repeatedly being electrocuted. That’s the best I can describe it as; it hurts for longer than having that spear run through me, but it lasts longer... so much longer…”

“What the hell, man…” I forced out, almost instinctively, “What kind of bullshit are you trying to tell me, I screamed, out of breath, my head spinning. It was too much. Pictures of death and ruin flooded my head. People torn to pieces in explosions, ripped open by high-caliber ammunition. All manner of violence and horror unfolded in front of my eyes, mercilessly repeating images from perdition coursing inside my head.

“You’re fucking mad, you old fuck,” I cursed at him, completely ignoring the onlookers.

And he laughed, he fucking laughed, a full, hearty, belly laugh. The sick son of a bitch laughed at me.

“Oh, you understand what I’m talking about, kid, truly understand.” He chuckled. “I can see it in your eyes. The weight of damnation hanging around your neck like a hangman’s noose.” He continued.

“I’m leaving,” I said, about to leave the bar.

“Oh, didn’t you come here for closure?” he questioned, slyly, and he was right. I did come there for closure. So, I gritted my teeth, slammed a fist on the counter, and demanded he make it quick.

“That’s what I thought,” he called out triumphantly. “Anyway, any time the dogs came to tear me limb from limb in my sleep, a tragedy struck in the real world. The first time I returned home, I found my then-girlfriend fucking my best friend. Broke my arm prosthesis on his head. Never wore one since.

“Then came the troubles with my eventual wife. I loved her, and she loved me, but we were awful for each other. Until the day she passed, we were a match made in hell. And every time our marriage nearly fell apart, I was eaten alive by the hounds of doom. Ironic, isn’t it, that my dying again and again saved my marriage. Because every time it happened, and we'd have this huge fight, I'd try to make things better. Despite everything, I love Sandy; I couldn't even imagine myself without her. Yes, I was a terrible husband and a terrible father, but can you blame me? I was a broken half man, forced to cling onto life, for way too long.”

“You know how I got these, don’t you?” he pointed to his face, laughing. “My firstborn, in a drug-crazed state, shot me in my fucking face… can ya believe it, son? Cause I refused to give him money to kill himself! That, too, came after I was torn into pieces by the dogs. Man, I hate dogs so much, even now. Used to love em’ as a kid, now I can’t stand even hearing the sound of dog paws scraping. Shit, makes my spine curl in all sorts of ways and the hair on my body stands up…”

I hated where this was going…

“But you know what became of him, huh? My other brat, nah, not a brat, the pride of my life. The one who gets me… Fucking watched him overdose on something and then fed him to his own dogs. Ha masterstroke.”

Shit, he went there.

“You let your own brother die, for trying to kill your father, and then did the unthinkable, you fed his not yet cold corpse to his own fucking dogs. You’re a genius, my boy. I wish I could kiss you now. I knew all along. I just couldn’t bring myself to say anything. I’m proud of you, son. I love you, Tommy… I wish I said this more often, I love you…”

God damn it, he did it. He made me tear up again like a little boy, that old bastard.

“I’m sorry, kiddo, I wish I were a better father to you, I wish I were better to you. I wish I couldn’t discourage you from following in my footsteps. It’s only led you into a very dark place. But watching you as you are now, it just breaks my heart.” His voice quivered, “You too, made that deal, didn’cha, kiddo?”

I could only nod.

“Like father, like son, eh… Well, I hope it isn’t as bad as mine was.” He chuckled before turning away from me.

I hate the fact that he figured it out. My old man and I ended up in the same rowing the same boat. I don't have to relieve death now and again; I merely see it everywhere I look. Not that that's much better.

“Hey, Dad…” I called out to him when I felt a wet hand touch my shoulder. Turning around, I felt my skin crawl and my stomach twist in knots. Roger stood behind me, a bloody, half-torn arm resting limp on my shoulder, his head and torso ripped open in half, viscera partially exposed.

“I think we should get going, you’ve outdone yourself today, man…” he gargled with half of his mouth while blood bubbles popped around the edge of his exposed trachea.

Seeing him like this again forced all of my intestinal load to the floor.

“Drinking this much might kill ya, you know, bro?” he gargled, even louder this time, sounding like a perverted death rattle scraping against my ears. I threw up even more, making a mess of myself.

One of the patrons, with a sweet, welcoming voice, approached me and started comforting me as I vomited all over myself. By the time I looked up, my companions were gone, and all that was left was a young woman with an evidently forced smile and two angry, deathly pale men holding onto her.

“Thank you… I’m just…” I managed to force out, still gasping for air.

 “You must be really drunk, you were talking to yourself for quite a while there,” she said softly, almost as if she were afraid of my reaction.

I chuckled, “Yeah, sure…”

The men behind her seemed to grow even angrier by the moment, their faces eerily contorting into almost inhuman parodies of human masks poorly draped over.

“I don’t think your company likes me talking to you, you know…”

The woman changed colors, turning snow white. Her eyes widened, her voice quaked with dread and desperation.

“You can see ghosts, too?”
