Hey, I decided to post my new story here before posting on my YouTube channel.

I never thought I’d be the kind of man who aims his rifle scope at another living person.  
But boredom has a way of twisting your routines into something you’d rather not admit out loud.

I’d rented this apartment in Detroit, East Side. Cheap place, temporary deal—three months tops, just to be close to a contracting job. It was one of those tall, worn-down complexes: brown brick, peeling paint, neighbors arguing in the hallways. The rent was low because the landlord knew no one sane wanted to stay here longer than necessary. And me? I didn’t care. I wasn’t planning on putting down roots.

Evenings were the problem. Work was boring, sure, but at least it kept my hands busy. Back home, I had nothing. No cable—I wasn’t about to waste money on that. Mobile data was enough, and signing a long-term internet contract didn’t make sense when I knew I’d be gone before the ink dried. I had a couple books, but I burned through those in the first week. That left me with long nights, a thin mattress, and silence thick enough to choke on.

So I turned to the only hobby I’d brought with me: my Remington 700. Bought it second-hand at a gun show a few years back. Cleaned it up myself, fitted it with a decent scope. Nothing fancy, just a reliable bolt-action rifle. I’d never fired it at anything living, and I didn’t plan to. But I liked the weight of it, the precision. Looking through the glass made me feel steady, like the world narrowed into a clean circle where everything was sharp and in focus.

At first, it was innocent. I’d set it on the table by the window, draw the curtains just enough to leave a slit, and line up the scope with rooftops and street signs. Ranging distances, testing how steady my hand was after coffee, after a long day, after two beers. Just practice.

Then, one night, I slid the crosshairs across the building opposite mine. Another twelve-story complex, maybe two hundred yards away. A whole wall of glowing rectangles, each window a little TV screen playing a different channel. And once I started, I couldn’t stop.

The first night hooked me right away. Dozens of glowing windows across the street, each one a private stage I wasn’t supposed to see. People arguing, eating, laughing, living. I told myself it was just curiosity, just something to pass the time. But the truth is, it felt wrong—and that was part of the pull. The fact that they couldn’t see me, while I could see everything, gave me a rush that was half excitement, half guilt. Like I’d crossed into a place I wasn’t supposed to be, and found it too fascinating to leave.

It’s funny how boredom makes you cross lines you swore you’d never cross.  
Loneliness teaches you habits you’d never admit in daylight.

Over the next few nights, the habit stuck. I’d come home, heat up some leftovers, maybe drink a beer, then pull the curtains just enough and lean into the scope. The apartment complex across the street turned into my private theater. Dozens of shows, none of them knowing they had an audience.

Most people would probably call it sick. And maybe it was. But for me, it was survival. Better to be the watcher than the man alone in the dark with nothing but his thoughts.

When you stare into other people’s lives long enough, you realize how predictable we all are. Most windows replay the same story, night after night.  
But every now and then, something new slips through the cracks.

It was on the eighth night that I noticed him.

A window on the eighth floor. At first glance, nothing unusual—just a dim, bare room with yellowing wallpaper and a single bed pushed into the corner. A naked bulb dangled from the ceiling. The rest was empty: a couple chairs stacked in the corner, a rug that had seen better decades. The kind of space you’d expect in a building like this—cheap, forgotten, temporary.

But the figure on the bed was what stopped me.

He was sitting cross-legged, back straight, facing the wall. His head was completely bald, skin pale under the light. He was shirtless, skinny to the point of wrong—his spine curved under the skin like a row of knots pulled too tight. His arms dangled long at his sides, fingertips brushing his knees. He didn’t move. Not once.

I held my breath, watching him. Maybe he was meditating. Maybe asleep sitting up. Maybe dead. Hell, maybe it wasn’t even a person—maybe a mannequin someone left behind. I tried to convince myself of all those things, but none of them stuck. Something about him made the hair rise on the back of my neck.

I swept the scope across the wall he was staring at. Nothing there. No posters, no pictures, not even cracks that might hold his attention. Just peeling wallpaper, water stains, the color of old teeth. I shifted back to him. Still motionless. Still staring.

Most people move, even if just to scratch their nose.  
But that night, he didn’t. And I knew I’d be back at the window tomorrow.

The eighth-night discovery should have scared me off. Any reasonable man would have looked at that pale figure in the bare room, muttered something about “not my business,” and turned away.  
But the truth? It made me hungrier.

Soon, watching the building across the street wasn’t just a way to kill time—it was my ritual. Every evening after work, I’d heat up something cheap, crack open a beer, and settle into my spot at the window. Curtains drawn just enough, scope angled across the gap, my eye drinking in those glowing rectangles.

I had plenty of windows to choose from, but a few became my favorites.

There was the single mom with two kids. Her boys treated the living room like a trampoline park, bouncing off the couch while she dragged herself in after work. Sometimes she’d yell, sometimes she’d laugh, sometimes she just sank into the sofa with a bottle of cheap wine and stared through the TV like she was miles away. I didn’t pity her—I respected her. She kept going, even when it was obvious she had nothing left in the tank.

Then there was the young couple. They were relentless, like they’d made a bet with themselves to see how many ways two people could wear each other out before sunrise. At first, it was entertaining—like stumbling across a pay-per-view show for free—but eventually it was just predictable. Still, I kept watching. Predictability can be comforting.

And then the gymnast girl. Twelve, maybe thirteen. Every night she stretched, jumped rope, practiced handstands in her tiny living room. Always in that faded leotard, hair pulled tight. No distractions, no breaks, just pure repetition. Watching her was like seeing focus distilled into a kid’s body. She reminded me that discipline was possible—even in a place where everything else seemed to fall apart.

I never told myself they were “neighbors.” Neighbors are people you wave to in the hallway. These weren’t people I knew; they were characters in a show only I could watch. And each of them pulled me deeper into the habit.

But the bald man—he wasn’t just another character. He was a puzzle. And puzzles have a way of eating at you if you leave them unsolved.

A week passed. Every night, the same scene: him sitting cross-legged on the bed, motionless, eyes fixed on the wall. Sometimes the sheets on the bed looked slightly different, as if someone had changed them while I wasn’t looking. But him? He never moved.

One night, after two beers, I decided to break the script. I wanted to see if I could force something to happen.

I pulled up my phone and ordered a pizza. Large pepperoni, extra cheese. Delivery to apartment 8B—the bald man’s floor, his window. My hands were sweating as I typed in the address. I told myself it was harmless. If he was a normal guy, he’d answer the door, pay, and eat. And I’d finally know.

Half an hour later, I spotted the delivery car pulling up to the curb. My heart thudded in my chest as the driver walked inside with the box balanced on his arm. I tightened the scope on 8B’s window, waiting for movement. Any movement.

Five minutes passed. Ten. Then, out of the corner of the scope, I caught the driver coming back out the front doors of the building.

He wasn’t carrying the pizza anymore.

Instead, he had the box open in one hand, munching on a slice, earbuds in, nodding his head to whatever he was listening to. By the time he reached his car, he was whistling, chewing happily, like nothing strange had happened at all.

I sat back, cold all over. Where had the pizza gone? Why hadn’t he taken money? Why hadn’t anyone answered? Did he just… keep it for himself? Or had he gone up there, knocked, and walked away with the box untouched?

I wanted to believe the driver was just lazy, that he figured no one was home and he might as well eat it himself. But that explanation didn’t stick. Something had happened in there—something I couldn’t see.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I lay awake with the rifle beside me, scope pointed at the window, curtains cracked just enough for me to keep watch. He was still there, sitting in the same position, like nothing had changed.

Most people, I reminded myself, live entire lives without ever being noticed. But once you notice someone like that, you can’t stop.

And the worst part?  
I was starting to feel like he’d noticed me back.

The pizza stunt should have been my wake-up call. A normal person would’ve felt embarrassed, maybe laughed it off as a dumb idea, and moved on. But I wasn’t normal anymore. By then, watching that window wasn’t just a habit—it was an obsession.

Every night I found myself glued to the scope, waiting for the slightest twitch of movement. Nothing ever came. The mom yelled at her kids, the couple broke their own records, the gymnast girl trained until her arms shook. Life went on in all the other windows. But in 8B, nothing changed. A pale body sitting cross-legged, staring at the wall.

And the more nothing happened, the more it burned me alive.

I started timing how long I could keep my eye in the scope without blinking. Sometimes I sat so long I forgot to eat. Sometimes I went to bed dizzy, with black rings floating in my vision. But I kept watching.

That’s when I noticed the woman.

It was a weekday afternoon—I’d left work early. Through the scope, I saw her slip into the room. Mid-thirties, maybe older, dark hair pulled back, moving carefully, like a nurse on rounds. She carried a tray: a small vial, a couple of boxes. She set it down on the bed beside him. Then she leaned close, pressed something against his arm. I couldn’t see clearly from my angle, but it looked like an injection. He never flinched.

When she finished, she crossed the room to the window. Instead of turning her back on him, she shuffled sideways, her face always angled toward the figure on the bed. She cracked the window, lit a cigarette, and smoked it down to the filter. Then she stubbed it out, closed the window, gathered the tray, and backed out the door—never once turning away from him.

I told myself she was a caretaker, maybe hired to look after a relative. But something about the way she moved chilled me. The way she never let him out of her sight, like she was afraid he’d pounce if she turned around.

For the next few nights, I tracked her routine. Every other day, almost to the hour, she entered with her tray, gave him the injection, smoked her cigarette, and left. Always backing out. Always keeping her eyes locked on him.

It gnawed at me until I couldn’t stand it anymore. Watching wasn’t enough. I needed to know what was happening inside that room.

So one Friday night, when I saw her leave the building with a shopping bag, I grabbed my jacket and headed across the street.

The building’s hallway smelled of dust and old cigarettes. Fluorescent lights flickered overhead, buzzing like dying insects. I climbed to the eighth floor, every step heavier than the last.

The corridor stretched out in front of me, lined with dented doors. At the far end, junk was piled high: broken furniture, boxes, a bicycle frame, a rusted wheelchair tipped against the wall. And in that cluttered corner sat the door I’d been staring at for weeks—Apartment 8B.

I stood there, heart pounding, palms sweating. What the hell was I doing? Breaking into a stranger’s apartment? Looking for what, exactly?

I told myself I’d just listen at the door, maybe confirm he was even real. But then, beneath the thud of my heartbeat, I heard it.

A sound.

“Shhhwaaaark… shhhwaaaark…”

Slow, dragging footsteps. Getting closer.

I froze. The noise stopped right behind the door.

And then the handle began to rattle.

Not just a twist—violent jerks, like someone was yanking it back and forth, trying to tear it off. The door groaned under sudden pressure, hinges squealing as if something heavy leaned against it from the other side.

My blood turned to ice.

Through the thin wood, I heard it: breathing. Wet, ragged, wheezing like air being forced through a crushed windpipe. Each inhale whistled, each exhale hissed, closer than I’d ever wanted it to be.

The handle kept thrashing. The frame shook. For one terrible second, I was sure it would burst open.

That broke me.

I bolted. Down the hallway, down the stairs, feet barely touching the steps. I don’t even remember crossing the lobby. All I know is I hit the cold night air like a drowning man breaking the surface.

By the time I circled the block and made it back to my own apartment, my lungs were on fire. I slammed the door, locked it, and stumbled to my window. My rifle was waiting, scope already aimed across the gap.

I pressed my eye to the glass—

And there he was.

Not cross-legged anymore. Not facing the wall.

He was standing at the window, hands spread against the glass, pale fingers scraping downward with a squeal I swore I could hear from across the street. His enormous head tilted forward, and in the glow of that naked bulb, I saw his face for the first time.

No nose, no lips. Just two cavernous pits sinking too deep into his skull, eyes that weren’t eyes at all but endless dark holes, as if they could swallow the light from my scope. And yet—at the very bottom of that darkness, something moved. A shimmer, a twitch, like a pupil shifting in a place where no eye should be. His mouth gaped open and closed, smearing spit across the glass, fingers scraping with nails too long, too sharp.

And the worst part?  
I knew he was staring directly at me.

I don’t remember pulling away from the scope. One second I was frozen there, staring into those bottomless eyes, and the next I was stumbling backward, knocking over the chair. My hands were moving on their own, reaching for the box of ammo I kept in the closet.

The rifle had always been a comfort to me—steel and wood, simple and reliable. But loading it now felt different. My fingers fumbled as I shoved cartridges into the magazine, each metallic click ringing too loud in the silence of the room. I kept telling myself: if he moved, if he tried anything, I’d put a bullet straight through that window.

By the time I racked the bolt and raised the rifle again, my heart was beating so hard I could feel it in my teeth. I pressed my eye to the glass.

The window across the street was no longer empty. The curtains were drawn tight, swaying slightly as if someone had just pulled them shut. No pale face. No black holes for eyes. Just heavy fabric, rippling in the glow of the ceiling bulb.

I held there, waiting, the crosshairs steady on the center of the window. Sweat slid down my cheek, caught in the corner of my mouth. My finger hovered on the trigger, but there was nothing to fire at.

I stayed like that for what felt like hours. My shoulders ached, my eyes burned, but I couldn’t lower the rifle. Every second I expected those curtains to twitch, to slide open, to reveal that face pressed against the glass again.

They never did.

When I finally lowered the rifle, the apartment felt colder, emptier than before. Sometimes silence doesn’t mean safety. Sometimes it only means something dangerous learned how to wait. The moment something breaks its own pattern, you realize you were never the one in control. As if he hadn’t disappeared, just… stepped out of view. As if he was still there, inches from the fabric, waiting for me to let my guard down.

And I realized something that made my stomach twist: he’d never once moved while I was watching. But tonight, he had chosen to.

I moved out the very next morning. No questions, no excuses—just cash on the table for the landlord and a half-hearted promise to forward the mail I knew I’d never see. He didn’t ask why. Maybe he saw the look on my face and decided he didn’t want the answer.

The weeks that followed blurred together. New job sites, new temporary housing, different walls to stare at when sleep refused to come. I told myself I’d left it behind on that street in Detroit, left him behind.

But the truth? He followed me.

Not in the daylight—no. In the daylight, I can almost convince myself it was nothing, that I imagined the whole thing. But at night, in dreams too sharp to be dreams, I hear it. The frantic rattle of a doorknob, the hinges straining as something leans its weight against my door. That wheezing, broken breath sliding through the cracks.

And every time, I reach for my rifle. I load it, I raise it, I press the trigger—  
and every time, it jams.

So I clean it. Again and again. I polish the barrel, I oil the bolt, I run patches until the cloth comes out white. I tell myself it won’t fail me again.

But what bothers me most isn’t the dreams.  
It’s the memory of that night—when he saw me.

You can leave a place behind, but not the things that noticed you there.  
A weapon is supposed to give you certainty. But once doubt creeps in, even steel feels fragile.

And since then, I’m not sure I trust my rifle anymore.
