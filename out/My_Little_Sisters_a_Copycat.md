I know what this title makes me sound like, but I promise I'm not a whiny kid who goes crying to Mommy over every little thing.

I (18F) have a little sister, "C" (16).

We've always been close, but as of late, she's begun to look like me. It started off small, just a matching hairstyle and similar outfit. Nothing too strange. About two or three months ago, she started doing makeup the same way as me. Imagine thinking you're alone when all of the sudden, you catch a glimpse of a pale face staring at you, eyes wide and lips parted as if dead or something.

I screamed a bit and accidentally slammed the door shut, and C slinked into the room a minute later and apologized half-heartedly. She wanted a hug, but I was still shaken and turned her down a bit too rudely. I remember that she looked upset and stormed out, but I didn't go after her. Later on, I drove her to the mall as another apology, and I thought she had forgiven me. I should have known better.

I woke up that night to her in my bed and wearing one of my nightgowns, and she had moved me to the floor. That was a bizarre experience, I won't lie. When I tried waking her up, she told me, "Go back to bed, (my nickname for her)." Annoyed, I picked her up and dumped her onto her bed before slamming the door behind me. When I asked her about it the next morning, she just laughed it off and throw the tissue box at my head. (That's a common occurrence).

A few weeks ago, I walked into her room and found her sitting on the bed and staring at the door. Her eyes were blank, but they turned cold when she saw me. The strangest part was that it was like she didn't recognize me anymore. Like I was an intruder and not her sister. She simply got up and passed by me without even saying anything, and I followed her to the dining room, more confused than ever.

Today is where thing got really weird. She came home today with her hair dyed black, contacts that turned her eyes brown, and freckles painted on; when she said hi to me, I was surprised to hear her real voice. We're Australian, but she's always kept an American accent up for years. I don't even know the reason why. (Our parents were also confused over her to-them-sudden-change FYI. I mean, she just came home and looked more like me then ever).

Her personality has also changed. You'd think she would act more like me, right? Nope. She used to be so energetic and outgoing, always talking about the things she was interested in. However, she's gone quiet and barely says anything. Most of it is mindlessly creepy. Just today, she asked me, "Who would miss you if you went camping?" I don't even like camping.

This weekend, I caught her about to leave the house, so I asked where she was going. She said that she was going to my friend's house, and that D was expecting her. That confused me, so I checked my texts to see if I had missed something. Turns out, I had made plans to go over. I don't know what C was thinking. Maybe she checked my phone and thought it would be a funny prank.

I did mention this to my mother, who told me to go check the family scrapbooks. Since Christmas is tomorrow, I can look through them while waiting for dinner.

Any help is appreciated, thanks.
