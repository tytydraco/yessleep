I’m writing this from my phone on the floor of my hallway, with my dog shaking against my leg and someone trying keys in my laundry door.

If this cuts out mid-sentence, that’s probably the moment they get in.

The tapping on the windows stopped a few minutes ago. The doorbell finally went quiet. But whoever’s out there just tried the front door, then the side gate, and now I can hear metal scraping against the lock at the back.

The worst part isn’t that someone’s trying to break in.

The worst part is... they shouldn’t need a key.  
But it sounds like they have one.

And if I’m right about who it is, he’s been inside my house already.  
He’s been inside for weeks.

\* \* \* \* \*

This started at the dog park.

I go to the same one most mornings with my dog, Rocket – big off-leash space with a scrappy little tree line and a strip of woods that looks way creepier than it has any right to in daylight.

The day I met him, it was stupidly normal. Blue sky, coffee in a keep cup, the usual “What breed is he?” small talk from strangers. Rocket was doing his zoomie routine in circles, and I was half on my phone, half pretending to be a functioning adult.

“Is that a camera to watch your dog?”

The voice came from over my shoulder. I turned and this guy was standing there, maybe late thirties, hoodie, beanie, that kind of face you’d forget if it weren’t for the eyes. Too pale. Too still.

He nodded at my phone. On the lock screen I had a little thumbnail from my petcam app. I use it to check on Rocket when I’m out.

“Yeah,” I said. “Helps with the separation anxiety.”

His mouth twitched. “Yours or his?”

I laughed politely, because that’s what you do when strangers are slightly weird. He had a dog with him too, some kelpie mix going absolutely feral on a tennis ball. We did the dog-park intro handshake: names, ages, “he’s usually not this crazy, I swear.”

His name was Liam. Or at least that’s what he said.  
He asked a few too-specific questions.

“So you work from home? You must, right? I always see you here around this time.”

I shrugged it off. “Freelance. Flexible hours.”

He smiled like that confirmed something for him.

We talked for maybe fifteen minutes. It wasn’t awful. A bit intense, but I’ve met worse at that park. Only right at the end did it get… off.

Rocket ran over because he’d heard his “baby voice” tone, and I did what I always do without thinking – I leaned down and scritched his chest in that silly way I always do in the kitchen when no one’s around, saying, “Who’s my little man?”

“Ah,” Liam said. “That thing you do in the kitchen.”

I straightened up. “What?”

He watched me. Too closely. “You always do that in the hallway. Right by the laundry. You say it the same way.”

There was a long, empty silence between us. The park was suddenly very loud with other dogs barking.

“I mean,” he said, way too late to be casual, “I just… assumed. You look like the type.”

What type? The “talks to their dog in the hallway” type?

I forced a laugh because I didn’t know what else to do. “Yeah. I guess.”

But it stuck in my head in that weird way that only wrong things do.

You know when your brain files something under: **THIS IS IMPORTANT, BUT WE DON’T KNOW WHY YET**?

Yeah. That.

\* \* \* \* \*

A few days later I got an email from the petcam company.

**“We’ve detected a login from a new device. If this wasn’t you, we recommend changing your password.”**

The location was listed as another suburb on the other side of town, about twenty minutes away. I told myself it was a glitch. Or one of their servers. Companies screw that stuff up all the time, right?

I clicked through, got to the change-password screen, got distracted by Rocket bringing me a squeaky toy, and thought, *I’ll do it later.*

I didn’t.

That’s the part that keeps repeating in my head now, like a taunt.

You had one job.

\* \* \* \* \*

The first time I thought I saw him again was at the park. I was mid-conversation with another dog owner, laughing about how their pug was bullying a German Shepherd, when something over their shoulder snagged my attention.

In the tree line, just beyond the off-leash boundary, someone was standing half-hidden behind a trunk. Just… standing. Wearing a dark hoodie. Head tilted like he was listening.

I blinked, and the person was gone. Vanished back into the strip of trees.

“You okay?” the other owner asked.

“Yeah,” I lied. “Thought I saw someone I knew.”

I told myself it was nothing. Just some jogger cutting through. Or my brain filling in shapes. I’ve got anxiety; I know my imagination can posture like a heavyweight.

But then it happened again.

I came out of the pet supply shop one afternoon, arms full of overpriced treats, when I saw him across the street, at the mouth of a narrow alley. Same hunched shoulders. Same beanie pulled low.

He didn’t move like surprise, or guilt, or anything normal. He just stepped backwards. Slowly. Like he’d expected me to walk out at that exact moment and was already in reverse.

By the time I could cross the street, he was gone.

“Coincidence,” I muttered to myself the whole walk home. “You’re just spiralling. It’s fine.”

That night, when I checked the petcam app from bed out of habit, the little light on the camera in the living room blinked on.

It does that when you open the app. You see the live view, the light comes on, everything behaves like it should.

Except this time, there was a delay.

The stream went black for a second. Then static. Then my own living room slowly came into focus. The camera’s angle was slightly… off. Too low. Like someone had bumped it.

Rocket lifted his head from his bed and stared directly into the lens. Not in that lazy way dogs do. His ears were pinned, and he let out this soft, warning growl.

I checked the app. No one else was logged in. Just my account.

I told myself the camera had just… glitched. Reset. Something.

I told myself that a lot.

\* \* \* \* \*

The thing with the spare key happened the week after.

I managed to lock myself out taking the rubbish out – door swung shut behind me, classic. No phone, no wallet, just me and the wheelie bin like an idiot.

I keep a spare key for the laundry side door in an old pot near the back fence. I’ve used it a dozen times over the years.

Except this time, when I dug through the dirt, it wasn’t there.

I pulled the whole pot out. Checked the soil, the ground around it, the little crack in the fence where I sometimes jam junk mail. Nothing.

I ended up having to climb in through a window I’d left latched but not locked. Scratched the hell out of myself and scared Rocket half to death.

I told myself I must’ve moved the key and forgotten. People forget things.

Later that night, sitting on the couch, I got a notification:

**“Person spotted in laundry."**

I don’t have a petcam set up in that room. No reason my phone should ever use those words.

The notification vanished before I could tap it. Just blinked away like a typo reality corrected in front of me.

I checked the petcam. The little light was already on.

I swear – I swear on my dog’s life – the camera moved. Just a tiny adjustment. Like someone had put it back where it was supposed to be.

\* \* \* \* \*

By the time I saw him a third time, I’d stopped telling myself it was a coincidence.

I was unloading groceries from the car and it was getting dark, that blue hour where everything has soft edges. Rocket was inside, barking his head off because I’d left him behind the baby gate.

Across the road is another little stretch of trees. Nothing dramatic, just enough scrub to make it feel like we back onto something “natural” according to the real estate brochure.

I shut the boot and turned with an armful of bags and froze.

Someone was standing between the trees.  
Not moving.  
Just watching the house.

The same absent posture. The same tilt to the head.

“Oi!” I yelled before I could think. “Can I help you?”

They didn’t run. They didn’t even flinch. They just… stepped sideways into shadow and disappeared.

When I got inside, Rocket was staring at the living room camera, low growl rattling his chest.

The light on the petcam was already on.

\* \* \* \* \*

That brings us back to tonight.

I finally decided to do the sensible thing: new password. Two-factor authentication. All that. I sat down after dinner, opened my email to find the original warning, and saw a new one sitting on top of it.

Sent thirty minutes ago.

**“Your password has been changed. If this wasn’t you, please contact support immediately.”**

I hadn’t changed anything.

My heart did that horrible cold plunge. I grabbed my phone and opened the petcam app.

It logged in without asking for a code. Straight in.  
Because I was already “verified,” I guess.

The live feed popped up.

At first I didn’t understand what I was looking at. It was my living room, but the angle was wrong again – higher up, tilted slightly. I realised the camera must have been moved closer to the hallway.

Rocket appeared in the frame, pacing, looking from side to side. The audio hissed softly. Underneath the hiss was… something else.

Breathing.  
And not Rocket’s.

Slow. Too close to the microphone. Like someone was leaning right over the camera.

I stared at the screen, trying to rationalise it, and that’s when the porch light flicked on by itself.

In the petcam feed, the wash of light hit the front door. I hadn’t touched the switch.

Then:

*Tap.*

Not on the screen. In real life. On my actual window.

I turned my head so fast my neck crunched. Another tap, this time on the glass by the front door. Then a louder one.

Rocket went ballistic, sprinting back and forth, nails skidding on the floorboards.

The doorbell rang.

Not a normal impatient ring. Just a single, cheerful chime. Then silence. Then another. Like someone was pressing it with the patience of a person who already knows you’re home.

I put the phone down and crept to the door, staying to the side like every horror movie has taught me. I peered through the side gap in the curtain.

No one on the porch.  
But across the road, in the tree line—  
he was there.

Hoodie. Beanie. Head tilted in that same listening pose.

He lifted one arm and slowly, almost lazily, waved.

I dropped the curtain. The doorbell rang again, long and shrill this time. Rocket whined, backing up toward the hallway.

My phone buzzed. I looked down.

**New device added: Guest.**  
**Live view: ON.**

The petcam light in the living room flared, washing the doorway in that cold little LED glow.

From further down the house, near the back, I heard it:

The metallic *clunk* of a key sliding into a lock.

The laundry door.

For a second I couldn’t move. My body just shut down, like my brain had yanked the breaker switch.

Then the key turned.

It was such a normal sound. Familiar. I’ve done it a thousand times myself. That’s what made it worse. The ordinary click of someone who belongs here.

The door creaked open.

Rocket stopped barking. He went very still, ears flat, staring down the hall toward the laundry. A low whine leaked out of him, the kind dogs make at the vet.

The petcam app on my phone switched feeds. I didn’t touch it.

It cut from the live view of the living room to a different angle I’d never seen before.  
My hallway.  
From behind me.

There’s no camera there.

On the screen, I saw the back of my own head. My shoulders. Rocket pressed against my leg. And at the end of the hall, the open mouth of the doorway to the laundry – nothing but blackness beyond it.

Something moved in that darkness. Just a fragment of pale, like knuckles resting on the doorframe. Like someone leaning just out of sight.

The audio crackled, and a voice came through the phone speaker, too close to the mic, almost inside my ear.

“I told you,” it whispered. “You always do that in the hallway when you’re scared.”

My hand is shaking so hard it’s hard to type this. The doorbell just rang again, once, like punctuation.

Rocket is staring at the phone now, not the hallway. His tail is curled tight under him.

Whoever is in the laundry just started walking.

I can hear the bare, slow footsteps on the tiles, heading for the wooden boards. Heading for me.

The petcam light just went out.  
But the breathing in the speaker didn’t.
