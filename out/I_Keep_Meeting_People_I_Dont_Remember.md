I didn’t understand it. He looked at me as though he knew me, and he said he did. Just last week, he told me, he met me at the bar I frequent and that we’ve sat and drunk for hours, him telling me about his issues with his wife and I about my issues with getting my pathetic stories published. Although he was adamant about me being the one that had called my stories pathetic. Regardless, we came to stand across from each other in that uncomfortable silence meant to be filled with conversation. I pretended to have plans and politely bid him farewell. There was absolutely no way he believed me, but I’d rather that than pretending I knew who he was, God, I didn’t even remember his name. I promised myself I’d go easy on the liquor next time because truth be told, this had worried me. 

I had memories of leaving my house, already having a slight buzz going and I remember entering the bar, greeting my favorite bartender, talking to familiar faces and then… nothing. I didn’t even realize how much I’d forgotten. See, by that point I’ve long settled into this blissful ignorance of previous night’s events as long as I somehow managed to get myself home afterwards, and I always did. Therefore I never particularly cared about my excessive drinking habits, but in that moment I admit I felt something almost akin to shame, almost. It took me only a comically short amount of time to get over it, forget about the man once more and resume my indulgences, spending night after night the same unapologetic way. It helped soothe the pains of a worldly life and let me forget about whatever had been plaguing me throughout the day. Such as staring at the prices at the market. 

I sighed as I made peace with the loss of weight in my wallet before I suddenly felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned and came face to face with a beautiful man. His smile had been a little crooked and his big nose tilted to the right just enough to be noticeable. I’d never cared about insignificant things such as beauty, right then I hadn’t even noticed I was staring until he spoke and pulled me out of my trance.

“Why didn’t you call me?”

I blinked in confusion. I’d never met this man before, of that I had been certain. Yet he remained adamant he knew me. According to him we had left the bar sometime after midnight to walk around the sleepless city and alongside the river. 

“The river was so beautiful that night, don’t you agree?” He smirked at me as if hinting at a secret joke we’d both been in on. 

I’d then apparently laid bare my frustrations about, again, the prospect of getting any of my work published or even just noticed by anyone. Knowing me I probably talked the poor man’s ear off while I was at it, but that still just couldn’t have been. He gave me a knowing look and leaned in to whisper something in my ear.

“What? Are you embarrassed?” 

I immediately recoiled to create distance between us, now more uncomfortable than confused and fished out my cellphone with a grunt, determined to prove he had never put his number into it. I froze. His smirk grew wider. There it was, his name and his number, but that had been nothing if not impossible. Before I could say something he turned to leave.

“Don’t keep me waiting now! I’m dying to hear more about that story you mentioned.”

And I remained frozen in the middle of the market convinced my mind had completely given up on me. I hadn’t been a stranger to blackouts from drinking myself into a stupor but never had it happened at this frequency before and never, even in that state, would I have been inclined to tell any of my stories to the face of a complete stranger. People I don’t remember kept showing up day after day, one after the other and each more disturbing than the last. They showed me photographs I’d taken with them and things of mine I was sure I had lost, that in my drunken kindness I had apparently just felt inclined to gift them. All concrete evidence of things I do not remember. I hated it. Hated their eyes that looked at me as though they knew something, like they held some kind of weight above my head for being able to remember what I couldn’t. And it seemed like they were all in on it too; one big joke everyone understood but me. 

It didn’t matter how little I was drinking. I could’ve been sitting in the same barstool, talking to the same friend and sipping on the same drink for hours and then it would all be gone. No warning, no reason. It had at some point gotten so bad that I dreaded the thought of leaving my house altogether in fear of meeting someone that I couldn’t remember. Not knowing who I met or who I told what had managed to drive me half to insanity and more recently to my breaking point. A couple of days ago I went to some event for new writers, trying almost pathetically to build connections and to get just about anyone interested in what I wrote. Truth be told, I was far from a new writer. But who was counting?

It was there that I met a rather remarkable woman. I had seen her name before, it was hard not to when everyone was fussing over her apparent genius. She wrote crime and espionage novels, something I wasn’t particularly interested in myself but I could understand the appeal. I had never paid any real mind to her but once I saw her in person, I’d become nothing if not starstruck. She was truly a person to behold, so bright and full of energy, yet reserved and calm. It was as if you were in the eye of a storm, not in the midst of its destruction but perfectly able to see the possibility of being caught up in it if you ever stepped out of line. It was that quiet confidence that has people like me shaking in their boots. That author had been everything I dreamed of being and I was fully prepared to walk past her and that would’ve been that, but once she noticed me, she actually stopped me dead in my tracks. I was sure I was going to have a heart attack at that rate, being not only in the presence of someone that had so easily overtaken me in our shared line of work but also someone that somehow seemed to-

“I remember you!” 

Heart attack. 

“I’m sorry?” I responded in a quiet, broken voice that was barely audible even to myself. 

“Yeah! We met last weekend, don’t you remember?” she smiled down at me as she took my sweaty hands into hers to shake them. We were stood far away from anyone that could’ve listened in on our conversation and I believe she was well aware of that as she leaned in closer and shot me a wide, disgusting grin.

“Quite the story you told me, I’ve actually been meaning to ask you for permission to use it as inspiration for my new novel.”  

“I… don’t follow?” 

The author laughed at my confusion and continued.

“Oh dear, how much have you had to drink that night? You really don’t remember the story you told me about the man and his jealousy?” she spoke the last part in a dramatic voice, as if purposefully trying to get under my skin. 

“A man so caught up in his work as a starving writer, spending hours upon hours on each sentence and still getting nowhere. One night he met another man, a smart fellow and quite charming as well. It sickened him, although not as much as the fact he was a writer too, and quite a successful one at that. Somewhat of a child prodigy if I remember correctly, having received prizes from an early age and being published without any real effort! You said the man would’ve normally been paralyzed in both fear and respect for a person like that, but in his drunkenness a rawer, much darker emotion emerged from within. He was infuriated. So much so that on that night he met him, both being fairly drunk at that point, he led him outside. Let’s have a walk, he said. They strolled alongside the town’s main river and watched the full moon reflect off the calm surface. Drunkenly swaying side to side without a care in the world. The prodigy stumbled, the man caught him and they both fell into uproarious laughter. The man gripped his shoulders as he wheezed and pushed him over the railing and into the darkness below. *Crack, splash.* He looked down. The prodigy had hit a rock, crushing his body before falling right into the river and being carried away by the current. You then said the man made it home without incident and was never questioned about it. I must admit that at first I really wasn’t impressed, but by God you told that story so vividly that, if I didn’t know any better, I would’ve said it happened to you personally!” she laughed before her attention was directed to what I assumed was her editor waving her down. 

She excused herself, handed me her contact information and told me to let her know of my answer, walking off with that disgusting grin still plastered on her face. I stared after the author for a moment and then tore the card up, turned around and walked straight home.

I’ve been sober for years now.
