Me(36f) and my daughter Olivia(16f) live in a small town in South Dakota. She goes with her father every weekend. She leaves every Friday afternoon and comes back Sunday evenings, so usually she'll be gone by the time I get home from work on Friday evenings.

This particular Friday when I pulled up to our driveway I looked up at her window and noticed her bedroom light was still on. I figured she accidentally left it on before leaving. (Idk) 

I walk into the house and hear movement coming from upstairs

"Oh she's still home" I whispered to myself.

I went upstairs and knocked on her bedroom door and slowly opening it.

"Your dad isn't picking you up this weekend?" I asked

"No. I told him I want to stay." She said while looking down at her journal.

"Great, i'll make dinner for us and we can watch a movie if you'd like?"

There was a long pause before she said "yes."

I closed her door and I thought she was acting a bit stand offish. She usually has a lot to say. I texted her dad asking if they maybe got into some sort of disagreement or argument that led her to not wanting to go with him this weekend.

I went downstairs and started making dinner for us, as the food was cooking I started organizing things around the house and I noticed Olivias book bag and coat aren't hung where we usually hang our things when we get home. I thought maybe she just took her things up to her room. No biggie. 

I went into the living room and saw Olivia sitting on the couch facing away from me. I didn't even hear her coming down the stairs. She kind of startled me especially because she's just sitting there. Not on her phone like usual and the tv off. I walk over to the kitchen and check on the food. I yell out if she can please pick out a movie for us. I went out to check what movie she picked and to my surprise the tv is still off and she's still sitting there motionless. 

"Olivia you didn't hear me?" I said.

I grab the remote and picked out a movie, I chose The Conjuring. I love Vera Farmiga. I grabbed our plates and as I sat down on the couch I heard a notification coming from my phone in the kitchen. I told her ill be right back. I checked my phone and it was a text from her father. After reading his message my body went cold and stiff, literal chills. 

He said " what do you mean? I picked Olivia up from school and we're grabbing dinner with her grandma right now."

I feel catatonic at this point. I took a deep breath and walked slowly towards the living room peeking in to see if it was still sitting on the couch. It was. It was just sitting there very still. Looking forward but away from me. I haven't even see Olivias face since I've been home. Like the thing has purposely been avoiding eye contact. I went back into the kitchen, I didn't know what to do. 

Im fucking terrified. I had to go back out there, my car keys are in the living room. i took a deep breath and got the courage to walk out confidently like everything was normal. 

It was gone. I don't know why I yelled out "Olivia?" My stupid confused human instincts. I heard its voice coming from upstairs, sounding just like my Olivia. 

It said "mom. I'm upstairs, I need your help." In the most sinister voice.

Hell nooo. I grabbed my keys and ran the fuck out the house. I was shaking so much I couldn't even put the damn keys in the ignition, God I wish I had a push start for this very moment. 

As I reversed out my driveway I looked up at the house and it was at Olivias window waving at me, faceless. I couldn't even breathe, I never drove off so fast in my life.
