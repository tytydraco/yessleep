There's always that big dark sign out on the highway. You know the kind. A sign attached by some construction crew, on a big metal pole and powered by some solar panel, with bright yellow bulbs telling you something you don't want to know.



CRASH AHEAD. RIGHT LANE CLOSED, EXIT 84B OFF.



Just something like that. Hope they're okay.



AMBER ALERT

RED PIERS ZENGALI

KJ4-79B6



God, please, not that. Find the fucking kid, people, don't let the worst happen.



MISSING PERSON

BLUE PENNINGTON MIDWAY

BF9-46A1



Okay, not as bad, still sucks. Wonder where they got to. Hope they're all right and they get found soon.



Let's face it, we aren't selfish people, but we don't really think anything more than this when we see these signs. I mean, if I get an Amber Alert on my phone, I screenshot it and post it to social media, because I want to feel like I'm helping in *some* way, seeing as there's nothing else I can do. Don't you agree? I'm sure not many people do that, and it doesn't make me special. Just in case, y'know, someone sees it on my page when they didn't get it on their phone. Hey, now more people know.



But our lives go on.



I travel on this highway to and from work every day that has one of the more permanent versions of this sign. Sometimes they come and go, sometimes they're there for life, depending on how they're set up and where. This one's a thin, lightweight thing that hangs down just a few seconds past an exit sign's one mile warning, just over the right lane.



It always says any random thing that happens to come up that day. Missing person, missing child, accident, wear your seat belts dumbasses, look all you football lovers, there's a game tonight at eight and the stadium parking lot's gonna be full by the time you see this so why not park twenty minutes away at a freaking Grays Mart and walk the rest of the way and hope to God you don't get a ticket.



I don't care. I always wear my seat belt, I don't have any interest in sports, and it's not exactly rocket science to find out there's an accident when traffic slows down to the speed of a snail pulling a cinder block the size of an apartment building five miles before you even see the giant black rectangle.



Besides, I'm like three minutes from home by the time I see the sign every evening anyway. I don't always even look at it. I'm just ready to get into my apartment, jump into the shower, and watch gaming videos on YouTube until it's time for bed. Or play something. Or watch a movie. Weekends are a bit more eventful, but eh, I'm sort of introverted. That's why I'm moving to one of those roommate houses soon, better neighborhood, more activity, more people you see every day. A guy like me needs that.



I passed the highway exit sign, just the same as always.



Thought about finances. Gonna be cutting things real close by the time I'm done paying the lease on this old apartment, but my workplace gave me more hours, so I'll be able to get by if I'm careful and pay attention.



I was about to pass the big black sign. Gave it a cursory glance.



MISSING PERSON

GREEN TOCUNA CEREBULON

GR1-56Y4



Huh, that...



Just for a moment, it felt peculiar but didn't quite hit me.



And then. Holy SHIT.



My tires screeched as I began to brake hard, startled, then came to my senses and let off, still going, but slightly slower and with the smell of burning rubber in my nose two seconds later. An annoyed honk from behind me, a driver passed me and kept going.



GREEN TOCUNA CEREBULON



I was driving a green Cerebulon.



GR1-56Y4



That was my license plate.



I kept driving, momentarily chilled to the bone.



Then I burst out laughing.



Me? ME, missing? Yeah, right, news crew. Or whoever was in charge of reporting this shit. You guys will have to do better, because last I checked, I'm right here and I just left work.



I pulled into my parking lot, right into my designated space. Pulled my house keys from the glove box and walked up the three flights of stairs.



There was a guy standing at the door across from mine, watching something on his phone and laughing like a lunatic. I heard explosions, snappy retorts, and grunts and oofs from it. Probably some crazy fighting game or something.



He looked up at me and squinted slightly as I walked toward door 76, my own. "Hey. Annie having you over tonight?"



"Huh?" I said, looking at him fully. He looked tanned, muscular, and had tattoos and piercings, but one of those "friendly" faces. Know what I mean? Looked like a guy who wasn't there to cause trouble, no matter what.



He glanced down at my key and looked even more confused. Then he shrugged. "I dunno." He went back to his phone.



Baffled, I turned to the door and inserted the ke----



Inserted the...



It wasn't going into the lock. I stared at the key for a second, suddenly realizing something was wrong. It wasn't bronze like I remembered. It was silver, longer, more intricate.



The entire keychain was different, I realized suddenly. What the fuck? Where was the little plastic bee ornament from Bartle Bee Burger? The one they'd given out with the Buzzy Junior meals, that I'd found discarded one day and thought looked cool enough to clip onto the ring? Now there was just a key and a laminated rectangle.



I held up the little slip of paper, squinting at it. There was a small photo of a lake taken from a dock, framed in a dark blue heart.



I looked back up at the guy. He was frowning; he seemed concerned. "I didn't wanna pry *that* much," he said uneasily, "but I noticed the key didn't look right."



I realized I was fidgeting. "I...I might be in the wrong place," I said shakily.



Then suddenly his eyes narrowed even further. "Wait a second...hey..."



I waited for a moment, wondering what he was about to tell me, when he blurted, "Tino?"



"Uhh...my name's friggin' *Conny,* man," I said, turning toward the stairs. "Dunno who Tino is."



"Wait, don't..." the guy called as I descended the stairs. I didn't stop; I sped up. I didn't care to stick around. Something was so fucking wrong here, and I didn't know the guy. He wasn't the college aged loner kid I knew lived across from me for the last two years. Not that me and him ever talked, but I knew *this* beefy boulder man didn't belong here. Right?



I stopped in front of the building and looked back at it. Yes, it was the right one. The same black iron fence. The apartment complex's office was just to the left, up the hill. This was building 5.



Building...wait, why the fuck did it say building 8? This was supposed to be 5. It had been 5 ever since I'd moved there YEARS ago.



I turned around and walked very quickly back to my green minivan. I pulled my car key out of my pocket, trembling all over.



*Come on, this is fucked up. You know you didn't stop in the wrong neighborhood. There aren't any woodsy looking apartment neighborhoods around like this for another half mile, and none of them look the same.*



I reached into my other pocket for my phone, but it wasn't there. I opened the car door. Not in there either.



*Must have left it at work,* I thought. I could at least start there, right? And begin to find out what the fuck was going on.



So I drove there. Same highway. Same sign, even. The words flashed back at me from the other side of the double-sided sign, farther away than before from the other side of the median, but still legible.



MISSING PERSON

GREEN TOCUNA CEREBULON

GR1-56Y4



Yeah fucking right. I was right here, it was everything ELSE that was missing.



I pulled into my parking spot at work and got out. I stared at the building. Something was a little off, I realized. Something was different.



*NidoMax.*



What? I worked for a repair shop, Burroughs Hill Auto. *That* was what the sign on the side of the building was supposed to say. I mean, it sure had fuckin' said that when I'd LEFT here, not a goddamn hour ago!



I walked slowly toward the glass front doors. I could see a couple of people gathered around what looked like a main desk in some kind of lobby.



Burroughs Hill Auto didn't have that kind of lobby. Theirs was just a small square waiting room with the front desk, and old George was the guy you'd talk to up there. This one was way different. It was long and rectangular, and the desk was one of those U-shaped ones. I walked through the doors and stopped a few steps into the building. There was a carpet, I noticed; thin and blue, unlike the hard tile floor of the auto shop.



Behind the big counter was a large green sign with many different magnetic letters arranged here and there.



*NidoMax Electronics!*



*Nido! Let's play some games!*



*Cash in your Neato Points for prizes.*



*Eastern Gallery for the Hall of Fame and latest gamer news.*



*Western Auditorium for scheduled tournaments.*



There were two police officers, a man and a woman, talking to a young woman behind the counter who looked distraught. She was kind of beautiful, I had to admit, with long brown hair and thin, nicely shaped pink lips. She trembled as she spoke to the officers in tears, gesturing wildly, and as I looked at her face, at her dark brown eyes, I felt a flash of familiarity.



*Why? I don't know that woman.*



And then her eyes fell on me. They grew wide, wider, as wide as it looked like they could go. Her face turned pale. She looked like she'd seen a ghost. The officers turned to me, looking confused, then shocked.



Then suddenly, she shrieked, "TINO!" and was clambering over the counter. The policewoman turned to look at her and quickly stepped back so the employee could get through the swinging door she'd been blocking, but the young woman totally ignored it. She scrambled over the desk, falling halfway to the ground as she slid off the other side and ran at me.



I raised my arms in front of my face; normally, I'd have either swung out or started running. But for some reason, I didn't *want* to run from her, or hurt her, or anything.



She crashed into me, throwing her arms around me, sobbing into my shoulder. "Tino!" she cried. "What the fuck? Where have you *been?*" She was holding me so tight I could hardly breathe, kissing my face, my lips, my neck, crying, rubbing my back. I have to admit I blushed a lot. A LOT. I didn't know her, but she was acting like my long lost wife, or my----



...



...she...*was?*



No way.



But there we were ten minutes later, with both me and Carrow (that was her name) drinking tall glasses of water to calm down. The officers sitting across from us both. At the far right side of the lobby. A small coffee table between us all.



Carrow was holding my hand, running her thumb over my knuckles softly, trembling, and sort of peeking around in front of me, trying to get me to look at her. Several times, I did, and the pleading in her eyes was almost too much.



"Mr. Bauerfell," the policeman kept saying. Everything rang in my ears, false and tinny. "Are you sure you don't know where you've been?"



"I *told* you," I said back to him, my anger growing, "my name's fucking Conny Tanier, NOT Tino Bauerfell!"



"Teeny," Carrow whispered, squeezing my hand gently. "Please. *Please* don't talk like that. You never say things like this."



The policewoman was writing notes on a pad. She muttered something to her partner about abduction, amnesia, something or other.



I didn't want them to leave me facing Carrow alone. This beautiful young woman, confused somehow, convinced I was her husband, her husband they all said had been missing for three days ever since he'd left his post at NidoMax Electronics one evening and never made it home.



Why were they all convinced that I was the one confused?



Why were the other employees making statements about me like they knew me? Why did that guy with the freckles and the curly hair say he'd last seen me fixing up someone's camera before I went missing?



Why did the police let me go without any trouble ten minutes later?



Carrow kept telling them she'd help me. She said she would make sure I got plenty of rest, but they insisted I had to show up at the local station the next morning to give some information, whatever else I could.



"Teeny," she said softly, and by now I realized it was a pet name, something she must have called me for a long time. While...we were together.



We were together.



Who was she?



*Martland,* I thought, and flinched. Where had the thought come from? Her last name. Well, at least, her maiden last name. I knew it immediately. But how? Why did I feel like I recognized her? Why did I only know random blips of information, but nothing else?



Where the fuck WAS I?



She led me out to the parking lot. There she froze.



"Your car," she murmured. "We...I...I don't know if I want to let you go in it."



"What do you mean?" I asked. "Where are we going?"



She looked at me, so worried, so desperate. "Home, baby," she said softly. "We're going home. Don't you know that?"



She looked back at my car again, as though it were crawling with roaches. "I want you to ride with me," she said with urgency. "We'll come back for your car tomorrow. We'll figure this all out, okay, sweetie?"



She didn't want me to get back in that car because she was afraid I'd disappear somehow.



Her car was some weird model I'd never seen before. A pink Toyota Camry. What the fuck was a Camry? What company out there was called Toyota? I'd never heard of any car manufacturer like that before. The license plate wasn't a vanity, but the letters and numbers were wrong, too. There were three letters, the hyphen, then four numbers.



*That's different,* I wanted to tell her. But she already thought I was freaked out enough. No need to start acting fidgety about little things.



But the drive home wasn't much better. This late, there wasn't much traffic around, which was good in my opinion. She stayed off the highways. It took us nearly ten minutes to get back, but that wasn't so long.



But the traffic lights. They didn't look the same either. The lights didn't go from left to right. They were top to bottom, and there were only three bulbs, not four. There was no blue light.



She slowed down as she neared the light. It was red. I blinked in confusion. What was she doing?



Suddenly, it turned green. She started to speed up. "Wait!" I cried. "Don't----what are you doing?"



"Tino?" she said, worried, slowing down for a second as she stared at me, biting her lip, but then sped back up again. My heart dropped into my chest as she went right through the intersection----



And the cars on the sides stayed put.



*What the actual fuck? Their light must be red by now. Why aren't they moving?*



Maybe they'd seen Carrow shooting toward the intersection and were waiting for her to go. But why did she just fly through a green light like that? I could imagine the other drivers shaking their heads.



But that didn't stay with me long.



She pulled up to a beautiful white ranch-style house, pretty big for one story. I couldn't believe my eyes. This thing was way bigger than I had the right to even *imagine* affording.



The yard was well kept, there were no houses nearby----no neighborhood, just a lone property. Green sloping land on both sides. A small pink bicycle sat in the dirt driveway. A tall, thick tree grew in the yard, and a plastic tire swing lazily spun in the late evening breeze.



We both got out of the car as the front door opened. It was two; a thick metal door behind a dark green wooden door with a big square window.



A teenage girl stepped outside, followed by a much younger girl. I didn't recognize the older one, but the little one, maybe three or four, gave me that same flash of familiarity that Carrow had when I'd first seen her.



"Hey!" the teen said, staring at me in shock. "Mr. Baurfell? What happened? Where were you the past few days? Everyone at school's been talking about it----"



"Please, Jen," Carrow said, shaking her head and waving her hands pleadingly. "He's had a really rough time. He's confused. He doesn't know what's going on. Thanks for watching Brandi, but I need to take Tino inside now."



"Daddy!" the little girl shrieked, running around Jen and straight at me. My heart leaped, and a lump formed in my throat.



*Daddy.* The sound of that tore at my insides. She sounded so familiar, so desperate, so miserable, as though she'd cried her eyes out the past few days without me. The cry of a child who thought she would never see her father again.



And I didn't even know her.



Her little arms went around my stomach, and I silently thanked God that at least she couldn't squeeze as hard as Carrow had. I very much enjoyed being able to breathe.



*Brandi.*



"Brandi?" I whispered, getting down on my knees to see her at eye level.



"Daddy," she sniffed. "Did someone nap you? Mommy said someone napped you."



The teenager, Jen, stifled a laugh, and turned red as Carrow glanced at her. "Sorry," she muttered, and began to jog down the driveway. Then she stopped, and turned back. "Um...we hope you come back, Mr. Baurfell," she called back, kind of awkwardly. "If things...clear up. You know. Ms. Fish fired you after you didn't come back the third day, and she didn't believe you were missing. You know how that old bat doesn't even...well, I mean...you know...I think she'll let you back now that she knows she was wrong. I, um...some of us have been real freaked out. We just...we hope you come back."



She gave a small, awkward wave and turned to run toward the street.



Carrow was behind me; Brandi was holding my hand.



"Thaddeus Ardsley High School," Carrow said softly. "Remember, babe? You sometimes work Saturdays there since you usually don't get a full week at NidoMax. I've been telling you you ought to quit the electronics store, we're so well off and we'll never really need to work again...remember? And all the kids at the high school, you get along with them so well even though you haven't gone there for six years. They wish you'd stop being a library assistant and become a teacher, you relate to them like that cool big brother type."



I turned to look at her. She was so familiar. I felt like I'd seen her a thousand times, but I couldn't name a single one. Brandi, too.



"I...I don't know what's going on," I whispered. "I don't know who any of these people are. I recognize you both, but I...I don't *remember* you...I feel like I love both of you, but I can't remember anything we've ever done, or this house, or your car...the school...anything. I remember living in an apartment, working at an auto shop."



"An auto shop?" Carrow uttered a hiccupping laugh that might have been part sob. "You *hate* cars. You said you'd rather clean them than fix them."



I thought back to the cars I'd repaired at Burroughs Hill. To my surprise, I couldn't really remember any of the steps to anything I'd done specifically, thinking back on it. And the very idea of trying to do it sounded revolting. Cars were so confusing. How had I had a *job* fixing them for so many months?



Or a year or two? How long had I been employed there, actually? I couldn't remember.



She noticed I was shaking again. "It's okay," she whispered into my ear. "You're home, baby. You're home where you belong. I'll do anything I can to help you remember. We're gonna make it right, sweetie. We're gonna make everything okay again."



She guided me slowly into the house, and I couldn't believe my eyes. The living room was massive, with a large opening leading to a dining room and then a kitchen beyond to the right. There were two large bedrooms down long hallways, one of them a master bedroom. The other had to be Brandi's, I realized. There was a large garage-like storage room in the middle of the house behind the living room, with windows looking in from right there, as well as from Brandi's room. The floor of the storage room was concrete. It was full of boxes.



We'd only just moved in, I realized. We were unpacking.



I looked over at the mantel. A large, greenish-beige painting of flowers took up most of the middle space, but there were two small glass photographs on stands, one to either side of it. A wedding photo on the left side. Carrow looked so lovely in a white dress, and I looked happier than I'd ever been. On the right stood a photo of all three of us at a beach. Brandi was laughing.



I stared at them both, trying to remember. Wanting so hard to remember. They both looked so full of life, and they felt so important to me. I couldn't remember. But I already knew I loved them.



My brain doesn't remember them, but my heart does.



I don't know what happened. I don't know why my name isn't Conny Tanier after all, if I've spent my whole life going by it.



But if my wife (holy fuck, I'm MARRIED?) calls me Tino Bauerfell, then I guess that's me now. I don't want to argue. I don't *want* her to be wrong. I don't even mind that I didn't somehow take her last name (that's how it's supposed to be as far as I know, I'm not sure why she got my name instead).



They feel so important to me. This whole thing feels so important. So I'm telling you guys, too. If this has happened to anyone else----you just go "missing" from one life and wind up in another, and it feels so much better, so much more right, that you just want to let it happen----tell me what your experiences are like.



This is me now, I guess. I don't mind one bit. I love my wife and daughter, and I'm going to do my best to catch up and learn everything I can about them. To remember, if I can. Maybe I'll catch more of those blips.



But...if I'm not Conny Tanier, who is?



And why are there missing signs mentioning HIS name popping up from time to time?



It's been three weeks. They don't show up anymore, but they were around for a bit. That name...that person. Missing. I'm just glad I didn't slip back into that life when I saw those alerts.



But I haven't stolen someone else's life, have I? I *look* the same. I'm the exact same person, physically, that I always was.



Carrow tells me not to worry. To just live my life with her and Brandi. She keeps telling me I have nothing to worry about, that Conny was just some loner, that people won't really notice him gone. She tells me that I'm the one she wants to think about, not some stranger she doesn't know or care about. She tells me that I ought to think about myself, and maybe hold off on being so charitable toward strangers for a little bit. She says this teasingly, as if I'm always handing money to the homeless in passing.



But why did she say he WAS some loner? He's missing. Not determined dead or gone or anything. I don't want to ask her if she knows more. I just want to live my life. The signs talking about him have stopped.



I love her and Brandi, and I'm beginning to settle into this life. I don't want to think about Conny, whoever I...*he* was. I don't want to think of that old life I was maybe just imagining, most likely, or I should at least tell myself. I don't care about the talks Carrow and Brandi have in private, how she tells Brandi that Daddy will be okay now, he's alive again, that it's all right and he'll never be lost again. I don't even let myself think about that weird hospital document I found shoved down deep in the trash can with all the numbers and codes and signatures on it, and the words "transfer complete" at the bottom.



Time to see what the new future has in store.
