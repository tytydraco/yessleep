My route was set. Every day I drove the same roads, picking up the same passengers, continuing on my same monotonous routine. I drive a city bus in a certain languid, boring city in the Southern US. I know most of my passengers by name. I pick them up in the morning at the start of my shift, and pick them up again to take them home near the end. Occasionally I have unusual encounters: loud, obnoxious passengers; sketchy individuals; drunks that leave a pile of vomit to be cleaned later. However, there was one encounter that would change the course of my life.

It was around this time last year, mid January, when I first started picking up this strange woman. I never got her name, she wasn't the kind of person for small talk. She would simply hop on and hop off at the same stop one day a week. She was usually the only person to get off on South Industrial Boulevard, which is a neglected part of the city where shuttered and ruined factories line the streets. She'd get off, and immediately walk through an alleyway filled with needles and garbage left behind by the wandering junkies on the street. 

Every time I picked her up, something was different about her. I didn't know what it was at first. This started in the winter, so she'd understandably be covered up in bundles of warm clothes. However, over time rather than shedding layers with the warmer temperatures, she'd put more on. I remember first seeing her face, worn and tired, eyes red and puffy with a dull shine behind them. She looked mid-thirties, brunette, with sad grey eyes with the glossiness of someone either inebriated, or someone who just broke down in tears.

She kept walking down that same alleyway, on a path leading to nowhere. I know this city like the back of my hand. I need to know it, it's my job. The last few factories on Industrial Boulevard closed down around the time of the 2008 recession, and just like the low income neighborhoods nearby everything has been left to slowly rot and decay over time. There's nothing behind that alleyway except more ruins of long-departed industry. But seemingly on a schedule, she'd show up to walk down that alley once a week.

As I said before, she'd begin wearing more and more layers, even as the temperatures rose. If you've been to the American South you know that we have mild winters, there's no need for heavy coats and scarves most of the time. To my surprise, she would just pile the layers on – even when all the other passengers had returned to their usual short sleeves and shorts. What's more strange, it seemed like she was slowly concealing herself. Less visible skin, less of her face was seen every time I picked her up. As this went on, I wouldn't have recognised her if it wasn't for her mannerisms and gait.

I grew curious at this, picking at it in my mind before bed. I couldn't work it out. Why did she go down that alley? Why was she slowly disappearing into a heap of heavy clothes and dark sunglasses as the summer approached? I had looked online, finding no open businesses in the area she could go apart from a single liquor store holding on. It just made no sense to me.

I thought maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me, one day when I picked the woman up I got a real scare. She came onto my bus wearing a shawl, sunglasses, gloves, coat, and a scarf. As she went up to pay her fare, her scarf slipped down a few inches from her face. It looked to me like she had no nose. If you've ever seen Voldemort, or that one guy with the piercings and tattoos online that tries to transform himself into an alien through self-mutilation, you know what I mean. I saw red fleshy nostril holes surrounded by sickly yellow skin. I nearly choked on my saliva, nearly gagged, nearly shouted that Frankenstein wasn't allowed on my bus. But honestly, that disturbed me deeply. 

My wife thought my imagination tricked me, and I wish I could've just believed that. My wife told me this was nothing to bother myself about. “She’s just weird. Most of the people in this city have a few screws loose.” She would say. I just couldn't shake my curiosity. You know how curiosity killed the cat? Well curiosity definitely took me for a whirl myself. I had some time off work for medical reasons, and decided to sneak over to Industrial Boulevard when I had the chance. Without telling anyone, I retraced my bus route to the exact stop the woman would get off at. 

I looked down the alleyway, and it was as quiet as it always is. A couple of overfilled dumpsters on the left surrounded by used needles and fast food bags. On the right, an old sofa that has sat there for over a year slowly rotting and changing color. At the far end some storage units lining the old adjacent alleyway. I walked down the alley, and found myself at a fork in the road. Both left and right were just as decrepit, with graffiti covered storage units on one side, and old brick factory buildings with busted windows on the other. 

I didn't know which way the woman would wander off to, so I figured I'd go down to the end of both. On the left, with cardboard and plywood covering most of the windows and doors there didn't seem to be any places she could go. I even climbed on top of a dumpster to look through one unblocked window, busted like the rest, and saw nothing but darkness and mangled furniture inside. To my surprise, as I stepped down I saw the woman walking down the other way. She was slowly shambling along, covered completely in dark, heavy clothes on a blisteringly hot day in the late Spring. I quietly watched her from behind the dumpster, careful not to startle her, and saw her walk into one of the derelict buildings.

After she had gone in, I waited a moment before I left my spot. I questioned myself, telling myself I was acting both creepy and absurd. “Why am I putting myself in the worst part of the city, surrounded by trash and shattered glass, just to chase a clearly unwell woman?” I asked myself. I didn't have a good reason apart from my insatiable curiosity. So, despite my inner voice telling me to go home, I began walking towards the door.

I approached the steel door with apprehension. I still hesitated to pursue this further: my mind and body seemed to be at war with one another. It's like when you see a bad wreck when you're driving down the road, it's hard not to look. Before I could open it, I heard shouting. “No! You can't do this to me, not after all I've done!" were the words shouted in a woman's voice from within, followed by a slew of curses. I heard glass shattering, doors slamming, and loud voices and footsteps coming closer. Knowing better than to put myself in the middle of this, I stepped away from the door and slipped behind an old dirty fridge beside the door.

Two men wearing white medical slacks and blue medical masks carried the woman out. They threw her like a sack of potatoes into the dirty alley, leaving her a shivering mess in a puddle of piss. “You fucking bastards…” She sobbed with absolute anger and grief. “I gave you everything… I gave you everything…” She kept repeating, over and over in a slurred, breathy voice. She shook violently, then went deathly still. I was pinned to my spot with mixed emotions, and then forced myself to move towards her to check on her. I knelt close in a dry spot, and I looked down at her.

What I saw then have haunted my dreams ever since. Not a day goes by where I don't regret my actions that day. I never should have went. My wife was wrong. I was not imagining things. This was not the same woman I first saw in January, not entirely. I saw red flesh, scarcely covering the bone, surrounding her bloodshot eyes that stared right back into my soul. She was unblinking, unbreathing, dead. She just stared at me, she couldn't help it, she had no eyelids.

She had no nose, no ears, no hair, no lips. The rest of her body was covered except for her head, with her shawl in a bloody heap beside her. She nearly looked like a skeleton, stripped of all the features of her face. All that was left were her tongue and her bloodshot eyes. I have never felt such a chill creep through me as I did then. I have never felt such a feeling of dread, as I did when I looked up and saw what was written on the door.
