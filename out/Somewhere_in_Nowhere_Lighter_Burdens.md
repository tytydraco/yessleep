I’m sure you’ve been to at least one funeral in your life, whether you barely remember it or it just happened yesterday. If the latter is the case, my condolences to you.

Loss is a universal experience. Almost everyone has been in a graveyard before. I remember picking at the grass as they buried my grandfather, the sun beating down on my pigtail braids and making me sweat through the sundress my mother put me in. Little black bahiagrass seeds clung to my fingers as they lowered him into the ground. 

Graveyards are mostly silent. Besides the hushed whispers and sobs of people, and the faint sound of birdsong and wind through the dry trees, nothing stirs. It all rolls beneath the heavy silence like water under a fish trawler. When you’re alone, paying your respects to people you don’t remember or people whose loss makes you forget how to live, it’s even quieter— like the world around you has died too.

Rot isn’t like that. Decay is loud, hot, gross, and putrid. It’s like bad sex. It makes your skin crawl off your spine and melt away as your organs turn to soup. It turns your bones into yellow twigs and sends the maggots and worms and god knows what else to feast on what’s left, like whipped butter spread onto toast. Rot howls and shakes until the wooden box or shallow hole that holds it collapses and leaves pockmarks in the thirsty dirt. 

In our case, rot slammed its cracked hooves against the table as it bellowed out a war cry in my kitchen. 

I was only able to shield Dawson for a moment, crying for him to look out, before he shoved me to the side. The Rot lunged from the table and connected its front hooves to his collarbone, sending him crashing into the wall. His head snapped to the side at an odd angle as the wood splintered, and he twitched for a moment before letting out a loud groan and slumping to the floor. He wasn’t dead, but blood ran down the side of his head like streaks of melting ice cream. 

I threw myself without hesitation into its back, pummeling my fists into its spine, making dry snaps and cracks. It wrapped its lower half, suddenly longer, against my waist and slingshotted me into the kitchen door. The wood held, but the glass shattered all over me, landing in my hair like a shitty crown. 

Dawson had disappeared, and I sincerely hoped he had gone somewhere safe. As the Rot scrambled toward me, its jaw unhinged and a long, pale tongue fell out of its mouth and dragged along the floor. I staggered to my feet, and it froze. I stared it down with all the fury and bravery I had left, which was a lot. Maybe it actually was thinking about going away. Maybe it knew I wasn’t scared.

I watched in horror as the Rot rose up toward the ceiling, slimy and decomposed skin folding out like a waterlogged accordion as its bones rearranged underneath. When it was done, it looked down at me from a full seven feet high with two extra legs. Its fly-infested ears brushed my ceiling. My legs began to move on their own, walking me around the towering monstrosity as its cow lips pulled back over its dark teeth. 

*Woooooorm foooooooooood. Rotted intooooo the sooooooil, Newport*

I wanted to puke when it said my name, but my body desperately held onto what little food it had been given recently. The Rot clacked its teeth together and shambled forward with unsteady weight, like a deflating tube man. My back hit the table, and when it leaned in, it ran its cold, fat, and dripping tongue over my face like an affectionate dog. I couldn’t stop myself; I screamed, and that’s when I heard the pounding footsteps coming downstairs.

“NEWPORT! DUCK!”

I was definitely at the edge of going into shock, but Dawson’s voice brought me out of it just enough to drop to the floor. I watched as he leaped over the table and grand slammed the stock of Alice right into the side of the Rot. The splitting sound it made as chunks of wood flew in every direction was euphoric but not nearly as much as the Rot’s distorted moos of agony. Dawson hit it again, this time in the head, and it sprawled over and into the wall, exploding like overripe fruit into hundreds of tiny patches of mold. They crept down the walls and into the baseboards, slowly disappearing. 

The adrenaline flooded out of me, and I collapsed to the floor in a heap. Dawson ran over, dropping Alice and pulling me up enough to sit in one of the chairs. Blood was drying all the way down from his hairline to the collar of his shirt, the side of his face was covered with cuts and scratches, and he was limping a little. I checked his eyes and asked him all the obligatory questions about my fingers, the date, and the President. Besides the visible injuries, his impromptu trip into the wall hadn’t seemed to do any lasting damage. 

I grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him as hard as I dared, given what had happened to him.

“Stop! Saving! My! Life!”

He pulled a look that was a little indignant but mostly amused. He chuckled, and I grimaced.

“You can’t tell me to stop caring about you! Stop almost dying, and I’ll stop saving your life! Until then, get used to it, buddy!”

I stared at him for a second, and he stared right back. Then I jumped up and wrapped my arms around him. I couldn’t come close to his python hug, but I tried my hardest. Dawson grunted in surprise, but then he went, “Oh,” like someone had just handed him a tiny, unwashed, adorable kitten. I rolled my eyes as they filled with tears.

“It doesn’t stop. It never fucking stops. It’s going to be back. It’s always going to be back, and I can’t get through this without you. I just can’t. He was right. Without you, it’ll never end.”

Dawson rubbed my back and held me close in his arms. He smelled like salt and stewed apples and pine. A feeling of utter safety washed over me as he pressed my head into his shoulder. 

“I told you, Newport. I’m not leaving you. I’ll never leave you. I promise. We’re going to figure out how to end it together. Night of the Living Burger doesn’t stand a chance as long as we have each other.”

Both of us jumped at a noise from outside. It was a small clatter, like a stone hitting a wall. I grabbed what was left of Alice and shoved Dawson behind me. He tried to switch us around again, but I didn’t let him this time. I ran through the front door and found one of the last things I wanted to see right then. 

The protection talisman lay on the porch, the rope unwound to nothing, and the crystal split into a hundred tiny pieces. We weren’t safe anymore. No wonder it had jumpscared me in my own kitchen. 

“Fuck. *Fuck.*”

Dawson picked up what remained of the gem he could and it crumbled to dust. He looked out at the road and then back at me with a heavy air of nausea.

“I… I think I’m going to have to go back to my parents. We don’t have anything here to protect us both. I’ll give you my necklace until I get back.”

I’d been reluctant the first time he did it, but it just wasn’t happening a second time. Not when that thing was out there— while it crawled around on six legs like an insect and recited my name perfectly. 

“No. Absolutely not. Frosty the Snowman is selling popsicles in Hell before that’s happening. Besides, I… I think I might have something that can help us. I don’t know how well it will protect us from whatever this is, but it’s worth a shot.”

Dawson seemed unsure, but he agreed to go up there with me. We climbed up to the bathroom and made a detour to clean up Dawson’s ‘horror movie makeup’; then I grabbed the attic hatch, Dawson following on my heels like a puppy. 

“You know, I’ve never been up here. I always wondered what that hatch was. Kinda weird to have one in the bathroom.”

I went to answer, but Dawson held up a hand.

“No, don’t tell me. This is the actual entrance to Overall Land, isn’t it?”

I pulled the hatch down, and a cloud of dust floated down, sprinkling into my hair along with what glass I couldn’t shake out. Even if I came up here every day, it would still be just as dusty. There was something about the attic that was perpetually forgotten.

“Oh no, I should’ve told you about this before, Dawson. Shame on me. It’s actually an express passageway to your mother’s bedroom.”

Dawson scoffed and began climbing the rickety ladder. Maybe it wasn’t the best time for jokes, but they were our bad coping skills, and we were going to use them however the hell we wanted.

“As if you could bag my mom.”

I went up right behind him, the wood trembling underneath our weight. The smell of motheaten clothes and milky mildew filled my nose, nostalgic and sad at the same time.

“Who said I was after your mom, Dawson?”

I watched the gears turn in his head in the manmade darkness. Then he let out a bark of a laugh. 

“Oh, you’re WEIRD for that one, Newport. So weird.”

We shuffled through the clutter, purpose momentarily forgotten.

“Awh, you don’t have to be mad that I’m madly in love with your—“

“Hey, what’s this?”

Dawson held out a framed photograph. A gold band ran around the outside, and inside, I sat among the parts of a soon-to-be-built chicken coop. That summer, our old one had been destroyed by a tornado. I’d been so devastated by the loss that my dad had taken me out and let me pick out a new chick for the coop. Bluebells poked up from the ground in small clumps around the picture’s edges.

“Is that who I think it is?”

I looked close, not that I had to, and nodded.

“Yep. That’s good ol Beelzebub.”

I took the photo and ran my fingers along the outer edge. It was unnaturally cold, like it had been pulled out of the grave.

“Mini Beez is adorable, but that’s not what I meant. Is that you?”

It was a question we both knew the answer to, so I wasn’t really sure why he asked it. The little girl that was and wasn’t me wore a too-large sunhat and a pair of dirty pink overalls, her horse shirt stained with lemonade and Salty Dog. My grandmother made ice cream herself sometimes. Salty Dog was a French cream base with a bit of peanut butter, chocolate chunks, pretzels, and salt. 

My childish grin was frozen in time, missing two front teeth and framed by long waves of black hair. The conviction behind it faded not long after my father took that picture.

Dawson looked at it for a long time, then at me. I trusted him more than I’d ever trusted someone else in a long time, but that intrusive fear still remained in the back of my mind. I braced for the words despite myself, but he caught me off guard.

“Are you happy, Newport? I mean, I know that, obviously, you’re not *totally* happy right now, given the circumstances. But I mean… you know. With your identity.”

It had been longer than I could remember since someone had asked me that. I touched the bruises below my ribcage lightly and smiled. The answer snuck up on me.

“Yeah. I am. ‘Specially with you around.”

“Good. And for the record, I never thought a thing about it. Not even for a second.” 

His smile matched mine, and I sat the photo down gently in an open box. Most of them were open. After my dad was gone, my mom spent a lot of days up here, touching and crying over her pieces of the past. 

The red mold had begun to grow mushrooms, thick ones with neon green caps that added to the ruddy hues in an unseasonably merry marriage. The light glimmered on the various odds and ends in the attic: a miniature, retro gas pump, a tattered minnow net with mismatched weights, a busted radio headset, and… wait, was that half a kidney? No, no, just ignore Newport. It’s not either of yours, and one man’s organ is another man’s hors d’oeurves.   

“At the risk of sounding like a broken record, what’s this?”

Dawson showed me a cowbell missing its hammer, rusted with age, with two tiny F’s etched carefully on the lip. 

“Oh, that belonged to my old steer, French Fry. He’s been dead for a while now. My dad left us, and a few days later, he just dropped like a stone out in the pasture. That cow loved my dad like he was his own father. Guess he couldn’t take the loss.” 

Dawson gave the bell a few pitiful shakes, but it gave off little more than flakes of rust. 

“That’s… so sad.”

He paused.

“Hey, uh, if it’s personal, you can tell me to shut up, but… what happened with your dad?”

The truth was I didn’t really know. Even when he’d sent me the lighter, there were apologies, there was a check, but there were no explanations. 

“It’s not too personal, but I don’t think I can give you a satisfying answer like ‘Oh, he cheated, and my mom told him to hit the bricks’ or ‘he ran off to join the circus.’ I don’t know why he left. I only know that it wasn’t mine or my mother’s fault because that’s what he told me when I heard from him last. There was a letter, but my mom never let me read it, and I don’t know where it is now. I don’t know where he is now.”

“Oh. That’s… wow.”

I wished I could cry about it, but the tears didn’t come. I just stared at the cowbell, feeling over the notches and grooves when Dawson offered it to me. Telling him lifted a weight off my shoulders, but the sadness never diminished.

“Usually, if a cow or pig died like that, we’d use the meat. But my mom insisted we bury him. She dug his grave herself. It’s out in the pasture.”

Dawson looked past me, clutching the bell tighter in his calloused hands. Instead of apologies I didn’t need or more questions I didn’t want to answer, he gave me a small and sorrowful smile. 

“Hey. When this is all over, we should take his bell to him. I think he’d like to have it back.”

I nodded, and he stuffed it into my front overall pocket. I brushed my fingers over the indent and felt better than any other consoling he could’ve given me.

After wading through to the deepest reaches of the attic, like something had hidden it from us, I found the witch bells. My mom wasn’t a witch, but several of my distant ancestors had been, casting spells and dancing around a bonfire late into the night while their farmer husbands slept. The bells were an heirloom; I could remember them jingling on our front door when I was a lot smaller. I held the wreath at the end, silver and copper bells tinkling against each other and the smell of dried herbs filling my nose.

“These have been in my family for generations. They’re supposed to keep evil spirits away. I probably should’ve remembered them by now, but I try not to think about my mother that often if I’m being honest.”

I knew he wanted to know but didn’t want to ask. He respected me too much. But I told him anyway. 

“She loved my dad. I know she did. She loved him so much. I think when he left, she got this crack in her. And it just kept getting wider and wider until it split open completely. One night, when I was 14, I think it was August, I watched from my window as she walked out onto the porch, stripped down to nothing, and ran off down our dirt road. I waited and waited, but she never came back. Eventually, I stopped waiting. I never saw her again.”

Dawson grimaced. I took a deep breath, happy to have it all off my chest. So glad to say it all out loud to someone, even if that made the years-old ache feel fresh. 

“You really have lost everyone, haven’t you?”

The regret showed on his face the second he said it, but I wasn’t upset. I’d long since accepted it as fact, even if it still stung occasionally. 

“Yeah. It’s been hard here alone, but until now, I’ve managed. Just know that’s the risk you’re taking being around me. I’m probably cursed or something.”

He shook his head and did his best to turn the grimace into a smile. 

“Well, that’s a risk I’m willing to take. But as far as the other stuff, I want you to know that I get it. Well, I get it a little. I’d say I wish I got it more, but I think that’s fucked up to say. My sister died.”

Dawson let the explosion from that bomb settle into the dust before he spoke again. 

“That sounds worse than it is. My big sister died before I was born. My mom had a lot of issues having a kid before me, and she was the first baby to make it to term. When she finally came out, she lived for nine and a half minutes.”

“No, Dawson, that sounds exactly as bad as it is. You didn’t even get a chance to know her. I can’t imagine how that was for your mom. I’m sure you’ve heard it before, but I’m sorry.” 

Dawson winced and nodded.

“It’s alright. And yeah, okay, it was definitely bad. My mom doesn’t really talk about that time in her life. She just reminds me that I’m her rainbow baby every other day. I don’t mind it; it feels nice to be someone’s hope. Other than that, my uncle disappeared, but that happened before my parents even met. Sorry I didn’t bring it up before, but I don’t like to think about it much, that sibling I missed.”

His words struck something in my brain, like blue neon running through coils of tempered glass. *That sibling I missed.* If I squinted hard enough, I was sure I’d be able to see it: the basket for fruit, withered with age and denial. I couldn’t eat blackberries anymore. They tasted like blood. 

There was something more I wanted to tell Dawson. Something that hid in the back corner of my mind, just like that basket. But the words wouldn’t come, and then the moment was lost. 

That wasn’t the fault of any awkwardness, though. It was because I screamed. Herbivore teeth dug into the meat of my leg, struck against rocks and gnawed against bones to sharpen their linear edges. It had followed us up here. 

My blood dribbled down the white jawbone, its patchy neck winding away into the darkness like a sun-scorched garden hose. I felt something pull painfully under my skin as the Rot began to tug. Dawson’s face went quickly from confusion to rage, and he grabbed the nearest thing to use as a weapon.

The Rot wasn’t very pleased when Dawson threw the book at it. But it didn’t react with hissing and screeching like your average demon would when hit with a bible explicitly made for “God’s Little Princesses’ as the cover proclaimed. Its jaw clamped harder on my ankle, and I cried out again. 

Dawson turned for only a second, making a desperate grab for the baseball bat only just out of reach, and that was all it took. It yanked my feet out from underneath me with all the power of a semi-truck, and my nails dug fruitlessly into old wood as it dragged me toward the attic hatch.

“NEWPORT! HOLD ON, I’M COMING!”

The last thing I saw before I was pulled from the attic was Dawson tripping over a loose coil of cow neck and crashing into a tower of boxes like a meat-filled bowling ball. Whether he wanted to or not, I knew there would be no saving my life this time unless I did it myself. 

As it pulled me into the hallway, its disgusting body snapped into place and slithered right along after it. I gripped tight onto anything I could, but all I got for my trouble was bloody fingers and split nails. The hold it had on my ankle went down to the bone, and I was lucky it hadn’t split in two. I thought briefly of the man who cut his own arm off to free himself from under a boulder— of coyotes chewing their legs off to escape traps. Even if I could’ve managed that, there just wasn’t any time. 

Backward down the stairs I went, the cowbell clunking hollowly against them. My teeth rattled and cut into my lip as I tried to flip onto my back and failed. 

“WHY WON’T YOU JUST LEAVE US ALONE?! WE NEVER DID ANYTHING TO YOU!”

It hissed at me through tight teeth.

*The roooooottttt coooooomes for yooooooou aaaaaaall in the eeeeeeeeend*

When we reached the bottom, I clung to the banister, holding on with everything I had left in me. The Rot groaned in irritation, blasting pain up my leg with each impatient tug, like I was making it late for monster church or something.

Then there was a sound I don’t think I or the beast had been expecting to hear. The laughter of a small child, a baby, filled the kitchen. I kept my hold on the banister but looked up to see Aunt Jean standing by the doorway. Her mouth had returned to its empty voidstate, but more than that, twin blood trails ran out of her dilated eyes. When I say dilated, I mean *dilated*. If there wasn’t the thinnest sliver of white at the edges, I would’ve thought her entire sclera had turned black. 

She was the one laughing, tittering to herself in the voice of an infant. The Rot, only momentarily puzzled by this display, began trying to get me out the door again. That’s when it all changed.

Something moved underneath the yellow dress Aunt Jean wore, alive and writhing. I could hear the creaks and snaps as old lady joints shifted and broke. The Rot responded in kind, returning to the centipede state I’d seen in the forest cornfield. If Aunt Jean had spoken then, I would’ve imagined her saying something like, “Close your eyes, chickadee. I’d hate for you to see me in such a state.” So that’s what I did. For good measure, I heard the lightbulb above us burst, and the kitchen was plunged into the near darkness of twilight. 

The next few moments were blurry and dark, carried only by the few times my eyes slipped open. I was thrown around in the iron grip of the Rot as I listened to tearing flesh and the echoing warcry of a thousand different voices. I caught glances of a ribcage, open and fanned out like the wings of an avenging angel, and of a hanging mouth full of angler-sharp teeth. I couldn’t discern which warring party they belonged to, but I hoped Aunt Jean was winning. 

Eventually, all the frantic motion stopped. I opened my eyes and saw what I had been dreading. There was a new crack in my wall, plaster and drywall rising up from the middle like desert dirt, and beneath it was Aunt Jean. Her dress was in tatters, and she was as soaked in blood as the ground the day I met her, a thin layer of dust powdered across her curled-in body. She was breathing, if only just.

I screamed again, this time in rage. The Rot’s skull was now wholly stripped of meat save for its remaining eye, long slashes running down its neck where fur and necrotic skin had been ripped away by the claws of a protective and inhuman aunt. 

“YOU’LL PAY FOR THIS! YOU’LL PAY FOR THIS! YOU’LL PAY FOR THIS!”

It was all I could say, a broken record with no end. I bashed at it with the hollow cowbell, my only weapon. Its body became rigid again, kicking open the front door with hooves as strong as a piledriver. I screamed and kicked as we left the porch, determined that I, at the very least, wasn’t going to make an easy meal. 

The last rays of the sun had drowned in the darkness, and the only light left was the ember of the porch light, quickly growing distant. That, and the eyeshine off the Pigman, standing in the field. Well, standing wasn’t the right word. He was rocking back and forth on his heels, making all sorts of noises. I wouldn’t have been surprised if the fucker was enjoying watching me get cow-napped. I could hear Dawson crying out my name from the house, and the pulling got faster. He wasn’t going to make it in time. He’d race out here only to find my husk of a corpse, if he even found me. 

The cornrows we passed were dry and dying, a bitter reminder of my failure at the worst possible time. I dug my bare, unbitten foot into the dirt, but it did nothing to stop it. Somehow, I suddenly knew that it was dragging me to the last field, where my property ended, and that’s where I would die. I’d never been more sure of anything in my life. I wouldn’t even get a final cigarette. 

At the thought of a cigarette, an idea bloomed in my head, like a forest fire devouring a match factory. I remembered how the shadows had shied away from the porch light. I remember stories told to me when I was no taller than a half-stalk of corn, about beasts that turned to stone when the sun came up and red-eyed, withered giants that feared the wave of a torch.

Maybe the Rot didn’t fear the light, but all creatures of the dark yield to fire.

I felt around in my pocket as my chin was scraped bloody against the hard, brown dirt. My fingers closed around the blocky case of the lighter, and I pulled it out, praying that I’d been a diligent son and refilled it with lighter fluid before I went into my porch fugue. I tore a dry stalk free and held it close as it gave a few pitiful sparks. Once the lighter caught, the corn went up in a roar of flame and a mini cloud of dark smoke. 

“Why won’t you DIE?! DIE! JUST DIE ALREADY!”

I swung the stalk at the Rot, and it cawed out in surprise and rage— an actual and very angry call of a crow. I struck a second time with all the fervor of a major league mercenary and this time it connected. Flames licked at the bone, and the hair remaining on its neck went up in stinking flames. It finally released my ankle, which made the pain ten times worse. With one more hit, missed by an inch, it fled into the field, disappearing into a blotch of mold, then nothing at all. 

“COME BACK HERE! COME BACK, YOU FUCKING COWARD!”

I stood there, screeching into the night, until the adrenaline wore off, and I collapsed from my injured ankle. The only other sound was the shush of ghostly wind in the trees, Dawson’s heavy footsteps as he ran toward me, and the crackle of the burning stalk still in my hand. 

When Dawson reached me, he stomped out the blackened cob and picked me up like always, running back for the house as fast as he could with a limp that I now matched. 

“Fuck, I thought you were done for. I hate to say it, but I really thought that it would drag you away, and I’d never see you again.”

“Gee, thanks. Shows how much faith you have in me.” 

I was halfway just giving him shit, but he shook his head adamantly.

“No, no, I didn’t mean it like that. I was just scared for you, is all. So crazy, pants-pissingly scared. But look, you did it. You saved your own life all by yourself!”

A monolithic realization crashed down on me at once, and the tears threatening to spill finally made it past my eyelids. My chest shook, and I shivered as I held out my lighter. 

I knew the kind of friend Dawson was. I knew he’d found my lighter where I’d left it on my nightstand and shoved it into the pocket of the clothes I’d put on, figuring I’d probably want a smoke sooner rather than later. Dawson thought about even the smallest things. And by extension, I would’ve lost the lighter itself long ago if he hadn’t brought it to me that one fateful afternoon. 

Dawson had saved my life yet again, without even trying. He seemed to realize it at the same time I did. 

“Oh. Silly me. I guess I—“

“Thank you.”

By the look on his face, he’d expected me to admonish him like I’d done before. But I couldn’t bring myself to, and I didn’t want to anyway. 

“You didn’t have to bring me back this lighter. You didn’t have to do any of the things you’ve done. You could’ve jumped off this crazy trainwreck as soon as the Rot got serious, but you stayed. I can’t thank you enough. I know I act like you annoy me, and I probably still will a little, but the truth is, if you left right now, I think I’d die. And not just because of the killer munch I’ve got on my ankle.”

Dawson let me down, staring at me for a long second. His lower lip trembled, and then he pulled me into another hug. It wasn’t like others before it, weak-armed and trembling as he sniffled into my hair. Whether we stood there for minutes or for centuries, it all felt the same.

We both jumped like spooked rabbits when we heard a long *creeeeeaaaakkkk* oh the stairs. I think we both expected another assault from the Rot, but instead, we saw a much friendlier face. 

Aunt Jean slowly descended the stairs, not as broken as she had been, but with slight mottles of bruises and the light stain of blood across her pale skin. She wore little more than a night slip and a pair of socks. God, she was *okay.*

“Aunt Jean! I thought you were a goner!”

I rushed over to her as fast as I could given the state of my leg, and for the first time, I threw my arms around her small frame. The hug was long overdue and just as motherly as I expected, and I closed my sore eyes as she smoothed my hair back with a wrinkled hand. In a voice that sounded like a thousand buzzing cicadas and the crack of dry wood— her true voice, if she had one —she spoke a single word to me: “Chickadee.”

I held onto her and cried some more as if I hadn’t cried enough that night. My leg was really starting to hurt— a burning sting that made goosebumps creep up my arms and had me craving to dig my hands into my stomach and physically force away the nausea. 

“Promise me you won’t get yourself hurt like that again.”

I knew it was a promise she wouldn’t be able to keep, but I wanted her to tell me so anyway. She nodded, gently guiding me to the table where Dawson was opening a first aid kit. The second I sat down, he lifted my leg and examined the bite wound.

He looked it over for a long time, saying nothing. When he did speak, his voice was quiet.

“This bite is nasty, Newport. I think it’s already starting to get infected. I’m taking you to the hospital tomorrow.”

I tried to object, but the pain shut me up. Dawson gave me the same treatment I’d given him: cleaning and bandaging the wound. He packed the gauze in extra tight, making sure not even a trickle of free-running blood was left. 

By the time he was done, the moon hung fat and yellow just out the window. My coffee machine grumbled to life as Aunt Jean fiddled with it. 

“It’s not done with us. All of this, and it’s still not fucking done with us.”

I pulled my arms around myself and shivered. It was that time of year when the nights rarely got below 70°, but a chill was quickly invading my body. 

“I know. I realize that. But you’re more important. Right now, we need to rest and regroup. Aunt Jean, I sincerely hope that’s decaf.”

She smiled a knowing smile, and I raised an eyebrow.

“You must’ve pulled that out of a coffee pocket dimension because this house has never seen a single bean of decaf since I’ve been living here.” 

Dawson brought the mugs over once they were full. I wrapped my hands around the mug and hovered my face over the steamy warmth of it. It felt like someone stuck my feet into an icebox.

“Maybe we should cut our losses and go live in the coffee pocket dimension.” 

“As tempting as that sounds, I doubt it would be animal-friendly.”

I took a long sip as Dawson lit one of the emergency candles I kept in the junk drawer. The kitchen filled with flickering orange light, casting funhouse shadows across the walls. 

Fever chills ran up and down my arms and legs, no matter how much coffee I drank. I unconsciously moved closer to the candle flame, soaking up the faint shimmer of heat it left across my face. Somewhere in the distance, I heard the tinkling of bells. I tried to think of witches— pale women dancing naked in the light of roaring flames and roasting alive in that same blaze. I tried to think of how this coffee tasted like dirt water. I tried to think of how the candlelight lashed across Dawson’s dark skin and glowed in his swampy eyes.

But I couldn’t think about any of it. Because I was goddamn freezing.

“I’m going to build a bonfire.”

Dawson and Aunt Jean turned from where they were looking out the window, eyes now fixed on me and filled with worry. It pissed me off. Hadn’t they ever been cold before? It wasn’t like I was dying. 

I wasn’t dying. 

“Are you sure that’s a good idea? The ground is kinda dry, and I wouldn’t want us to start a—“

“Yes, I’m sure, I’m colder than a witch’s tit in a brass bra, and that thing is scared of fire. We’ll gather all the animals up, and if we stay near it, maybe we can last the night. We just need to make it to daylight. We’ve got to make it to daylight.” 

My teeth chattered as I talked, and when I was done, I had to grit my teeth hard to stop them. 

“Newport, I don’t know…”

I grabbed the candle by the end as wax began dripping onto my fingers. It burned a little, but I didn’t care. It felt good.

“Are you gonna help me or not?”

The two of them exchanged a glance before Dawson nodded.

“Of course I’ll help you, Newport. As long as you promise to sit down and get some rest after.”

I threw open the front door and looked out into the yard. I knew the perfect spot.

“Dawson, if I can get warm, I’ll dance an Irish jig for you if you want. Bad ankle and all.” 

I walked around to the coop as Dawson grabbed Alice. My feathery sentinel stood right at the door for me if she’d been expecting me. She was the only chicken awake.

Beelzebub stayed perched on my shoulder as Dawson grabbed wood from the stacks I kept just outside the forest. 

Dark shapes swayed and contorted just beyond the edge of it, in and out of the tree rows, just subtle enough to feel like it was all in your head. The moon hadn’t made far enough into the sky, making the pines look as though they stretched upward forever. Out there in the dark, there was a lone whistle. 

Something about that two-mile stretch of woods wasn’t right. Not evil, just… not right. 

I turned away from them and how they made me feel, gathering a meager load of wood in my weak arms. I stumbled, and Dawson made me lean against him.

We dumped the wood on the spot where, seven years ago, my mom had hesitated a moment before leaving me forever. Dawson poured the gas, and when I struck the match, it felt like burning away the memory of her thin, sickly body.

“Newport, when we make it out of this, I’m going to make you the best breakfast you’ve ever had.”

I appreciated his use of ‘when’ and not ‘if,’ even if I wasn’t that confident in it. As the gas-soaked wood caught with a whoosh and the flames climbed high into the sky, I swore I could smell meat. Not rotten meat, or meat raw with blood, but the warm aroma of bacon. It did little to rid me of the invasive chill, but it was nice anyway. 

I wanted to say something stupid. I wanted to tell him to be careful not to get into the updog or that I wanted a steak omelet and the Rot’s stuffed head on my desk by five o’clock this evening. I wanted to say anything that didn’t make it feel as final as it did. 

Instead, I looked up at him from where I’d laid on the ground. The deep green of his eyes shone in the bonfire. 

“It’ll be a great one,” I whispered, and he smiled even though the worry didn’t leave his face. 

Then I closed my eyes and let the world turn orange.
