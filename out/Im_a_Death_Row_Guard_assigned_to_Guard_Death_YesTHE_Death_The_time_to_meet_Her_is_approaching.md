The strange man has a name. Caesar. Spelled like *that* Caesar. Names had significance around here. I reacted accordingly. I treated him like an inmate. Affable, with a mostly genuine interest in his affairs and daily life. I say mostly because he's a bad guy and there will always be a part of me that doesn't give a fuck about the comings and goings of a bad guy. I pressed him casually for conversation. I didn't get much, just that he had been in Death’s employ for 50 years and looked about 38. “Fringe benefit,” he said. I had to keep the questions to a minimum or they get suspicious, so I stopped there.

I'm good, though. You couldn't tell I was info-mining. Since Karma has given me the composition book, I had been logging the things that didn't make sense. She was right. I didn't sign anything except a single dotted line that kicked me into the top 20% of the tax bracket. Panicked, I yelled for Karma. She appeared wrapped in a hot pink towel with a shower cap decorated with pink rubber ducks. “Bro, I know you're new,” she said, “But there's a method to this.” She took out her clicker I knew kept track of more than numbers. “Sis, I figured but no one tells me this shit How was I supposed to know?"

She put the clicker back and I was audibly relieved. “Ok, what do you want?”

“Did I sell my soul?” I was terrified I had. I really need to get better at reading fine print. Boring corporate jargon beats dreaming about being drug away by hellhounds and ripped apart. I jumped at any sound that was remotely bark-like.

“No. Is that it? This conditioning mask needs to be removed after 10 minutes.”

“My paperwork, you were right! I didn't sign shit! NO orientation! No formal training! NO TAX FORMS! I'm lucky I brought my laptop.”

She giggled. "Yeah. Me and a few of my good Judy's are keeping it on the DL.”

“Huh?”

“It means you're safe, boomer. For now. We WANT the outside people to know.”

"And chow, we don't seem to have it. You guys are fed some kind of weird juice and meat diet. This is completely unlawful, you may be incarcerated but they can't through some slop either! And this is from someone who has seen prison food! Juice and bloody raw lamb is a health hazard. And why are you confined to your cells during chow? Unless you're in segregated housing I can put in an inquiry and I encourage you all to file grievances. Safe, supervised. camaraderie among inmates reduces vioence."

Karma sighed, and told me even though wanted to sock me half the time, the other half was a good apple.

Ok, fine. I'll take it.

"Ok, I’ll answer the boring stuff real quick.  Most of us drink enchanted nectar, the rest are certified baddies who need fresh raw meat. it would be bloodbath to have us in there alone, let alone with you in the same room. She smiled at the thought."we aren't doing macaroni jewelry in there, Dunkin.

In the HQ tier–in your Texas–the paperwork is taken She waved in the general direction of The Man. She does this often. of. You are, for lack of a better word, zapped in and out of your tier. We talked about installing a doppelganger but your wife would recognize it immediately. Instead she sees you drive to an expertly built mirage. It's solid to the touch, has a few homunculus on staff. You go in the building on autopilot and entire Tier 30 via elevator. Like Floo Powder in Harry Potter except the person who made it isn't a transphobic cunt.

Your wife is smart, btw. Doesn't know it but she's part forest nymph. That's why she feels so free in nature and loves to fu–”

“TMI.”

“Well anyway, she's protected. Everyone knows you won't work without her. Regarding communication, it's different for all of us. All you have to do is write “Dear Karma, I require your guidance” in the composition book. Justice will give you a small set of scales to squeeze.

“I thought she hated my guts.”

“I talked her down. You’ll meet her before Lady Death…if you survive.” She cracked up laughing. I didn't find it as funny. “Don't worry, Hamhock, just don't mention she's got a boob out. Needs a lift anyway.

We’re--all of us, eventually gonna be here to give you the real story, piece by piece.

The first piece is, have you met a man outside of admin? Zeus? Hermes? Any talk about that other death, Hades? If I were you, I'd ask about the Ferryman. Chiron the Traitorous boat boy.Put a few big bucks in his wallet and he squeals like your kind. Meaning pork.”

“Is this a women's prison?”

“You got it! And we ain't done shit that hasn't been done since the dawn of time. These fucking incels want to exact justice their way, so they stole the scales. They want instant karma, so they took my burn book! They tempted the Fates and won I'llthe thread of life, which is in the prison museum with Wonder Woman's lasso. Arachne’s silk for impenetrable uniforms. The scythe…we don't know where the fuck that landed. But it took away Death’s ability to Destroy. She can still control the population, still guide souls to the afterlife. But without the Scythe, she can't rip through tiers. She can't Destroy, which means she can't protect you humans from the beasties above and below. And when she can't destroy, things go really wrong. It's like firing the exterminator and crowning a roach King.”

“So, when do I meet Lady Death?”

Thunder cracked, and for an instant I saw what I can only describe as Miss Goth Universe. Black hair. Caramel skin. Green eyes with golden flecks. Black hair that looked woven from shadow. 

She looked me directly in the eyes with a half-snile.

“Soon.”

Then disappeared as suddenly as she came in. 

“Drama queen” muttered karma. Well my hair is ruined now so I have to go start over THANKS. Go build a house of straw or something, I'm BUSY for the rest of the night.”

Sunday, March 30th, I wrote in my book. I met her sort of. She said “SOON”. Tf?
