Hey I’m new here. My name is Josiah but most people call me Joe. Recently, I have been having reoccurring nightmares. And I was thinking that maybe I should write them down. So the dream starts like this.

I was out in a town that I used to live in. Walking down the Main Street sidewalk when I saw something odd. I saw this man, standing in the middle of the intersection. I couldn’t see his face but everything just felt off. Suddenly it gets really cloudy and it starts pouring rain and there’s this thick fog that descends on the 

Against my better judgment i approached the man and ask where i was.

“You are in my paradise. And you better get ready boy, you better run and hide.”

“Wait what sir I just want to know where I am?”

The man starts getting angry.

“I said you better start running and hiding boy.”

“I only want to know where I am sir?”

“Are you deaf boy I said you’re in my paradise and you better start running or I’ll put you on display with the rest of em.”

The man moves his hand over to a building with a sign that says. Paradise art exhibit. 

“Come take a look, if you wish for death.”

“No im good i think I’ll be going now.”

I turn to start walking away when he speaks again.

“The names Traum. Greatest artist in Paradise city. And this is my art exhibit. And you will make a great addition.”

“Ok thanks I am gonna leave now.”

“Try it boy. You can’t escape from your demise.”

Traum starts walking towards me and instincts took over. Like a doe running from a wolf. I took off in the opposite direction. I run past the paradise city bank and saw more people but I kept running. I couldn’t risk speaking to them if they were like Traum, I would be dead. I pass a residential area and that had been stained with blood, then I saw it.

The Church from my childhood. A safe place. At least that’s what i thought. When I opened the door to the church the smell of rot overcomes me. I walk to the altar head held low. I get to the front of the altar and turn to look to the doors i entered.

Rotten corpses of the people who had gone to church. All sitting in pews, some on the floor. I turn to the cross behind me and realized who was on the cross. It wasn’t Jesus. It was my girlfriend Madison. My girlfriend was crucified! I didn’t notice the footsteps approaching till he was behind me.

“She was a fighter and this was my gift to her. Everyone else didn’t fight. Except your friends. You had good friends. But they were nothing. Now it’s your turn.

I wake up to Madison shaking me awake wondering what the hell I was dreaming of. Madison was clearly concerned and all I wanted to do was hug her. I was just glad the dream wasn’t real. I think I need a break. I just hope this doesn’t happen again tonight. Any questions will be answered by Madison. Goodnight everyone.
