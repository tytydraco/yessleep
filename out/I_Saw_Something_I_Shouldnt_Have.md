I don’t really know how to begin. It’s been kind of hard gathering my thoughts about the incident since it happened several years ago. Trying to tell friends or family never really helped, and even speaking with my therapist didn’t help much either. So you guys are my last resort to try and hopefully make sense of this whole thing. 

  


I was around 18 when it happened. Just graduated high school and had all the time in the world to do whatever the hell I wanted. I was, and still am, super big into wildlife and nature photography. Was just kind of a little hobby I picked up on after my sister gave me a Nikon D3500 as a late birthday gift. Before I just used my crappy hand-me-down smartphone to get some pictures, messing with filters and whatnot and posting them to my old Instagram account. Anyway, I decided to take a trip by myself and my dog at the time to a state park near me in Illinois. This was my first mistake.

  


Now, I haven't been to this state park in years. I remember going on a family outing there to hike and spend some quality time together. But that’s when weird things started happening. I think I got separated from my parents and sister at one point. As I was walking through the trails, I got a little light-headed. It was sometime during summer so I had just assumed I was getting too hot. I took a second and sat down underneath a tree to collect myself. 

  


Then, I distinctly remember seeing a person standing on top of a cliffside, staring down at me. I couldn’t make out any recognizable features, only that it was maybe a woman. I passed out. Next thing I knew, I woke up in the family car, heading back home.

  


My parents didn’t know what happened, they just thought I had gotten lost and passed out from heat exhaustion. I thought that too. But that woman that I saw always lingered in the back of my mind, and ever since, I had these odd nightmares. Visions of death and decay, almost like how the seasons change and the plant life begins to wither away. It scared the hell out of me. But they weren’t common enough to cause concern, to me at least. That’s also when I noticed this longing to return, an odd pull at the base of my neck, like softly pulling on the string of a package. 

  


It was a crisp autumn morning. The leaves all changed from a verdant jade green to beautiful bright oranges, reds, and yellows. A slight breeze carried the fallen leaves across the streets, almost as if they were dancing. The earthy scent of decaying leaves wafted through the air. I woke up at an early 6 AM (which was way too early for a teenager who never woke up before 8 AM), took my dog outside in the backyard while I made a cup of coffee. Her name was Holly, and she honestly was the best dog I have ever had. She was a beautiful Czech shepherd, with a mostly tan coat with white and black markings. I only say “was” because she died of cancer a few years later (nothing happened to her on this day, thank god). Holly never was your stereotypical “crazy, intense, and hyper” shepherd like most people think. She loved snuggling and lounging around the house. We really got super lucky with her, not being a very active family. Which always makes me wonder: why did I even go out and do this in the first place?

  


I finished making my coffee. I stared as the dark liquid streamed into my travel mug, almost getting lost in a trance from how tired I was, but I quickly snapped out of it. I brought Holly back inside and got her hooked up on her harness and leash, packed up my camera, and quickly told my parents my plan for the day. I would be going out to get some pictures at a state park a few hours away. They seemed confused as to why I would be going. Normally I just stay around town and snap pictures of local wildlife, Cardinals, Mourning Doves, and any deer I rarely come across. But, I just had some feeling, like a soft gravitational pull to go out there. I just brushed them off, saying something like “I just want to.” I didn’t have a specific reason.

  


I gathered all of my things: my backpack, camera, coffee, granola bars and some water and threw it all in the passenger seat of my ‘08 silver Chevy Impala. I fucking loved that car. It always had problems but man the stereo in that car was so sweet. I loved blasting metal through them and just driving for hours. I miss that rust bucket. Holly eagerly jumped into the back seat and we set off for the state park.

  


I had some time to myself (and Holly too) before we got there. I was trying to think of what I wanted to photograph. I hadn’t been to this state park in some years, maybe back in 2009 was the last time? I’m not sure. But I do remember there being this beautiful waterfall cascading out from a cliff face. That was the main attraction, and the reason people went there. I knew I wanted some shots of that, but felt like I could do better. I think there was a cliff that overlooked a massive forest. I could get some pics of that too. Animals aren’t all that common there since there’s typically a lot of foot traffic but I was hoping to see some different birds. Maybe a Common Nighthawk, or even a Cooper’s Hawk (one of my personal favorites).

  


During my drive, I started thinking: “*why do I even want to go?*” I hadn’t been there in years. Yet here I am, driving down there on a random weekday, with just my dog and my camera. That slight, almost minute pull I’ve been feeling. Almost like something is tugging at the base of my skull, telling me I *have* to go to the state park.

  


That there’s something I *need* to see.

  


I don’t know what *it* is, don’t know *where*, and still don’t know *why*. 

  


After driving for about an hour or so, I realized I never had breakfast. I pulled off to a diner and decided to grab a quick bite to eat. Thankfully they had a drive thru so I didn’t have to get out of the car. I pull up to the window, ask for a breakfast burrito and some hash browns, and pull into one of the parking spots so I could eat. I pulled out my phone to check my messages but the reception out there was so bad it wasn’t loading anything. *Oh well*. I rolled down my window and decided to people-watch. I remember getting some odd looks, mainly from older men in their trucks. Seeing a long-haired masculine person with painted black nails and a nose piercing was probably the closest thing to seeing an alien was to them, I was used to that though, growing up in a mostly rural area of Illinois, I’d always get weird looks.

  


As I was sitting there, eating my burrito and sharing some of my hash browns with Holly, a guy in a beat-up red pickup truck pulled up beside me. I don’t really know cars, but after looking it up, I think it was some old ford f-150 or something. The thing was rusted to hell, missing a side mirror, and the oddest thing, it had these long, deep gash marks across the side of it, almost like someone had taken a knife and cut through it as if it were made of butter. He parked next to me and I got a better look at the guy. He was mid to late 70’s, maybe 80’s, I'm not too sure, with a yellow-ish white beard that just went past his neck. His piercing green eyes staring back at me through small, cracked glasses that rested on the end of his nose. He scowled at me for a few seconds, and I just stared right back at him. He then broke the silence, speaking in a gruff, almost smoker-like voice:

  


“You ain’t from ‘round here, boy?”



“No.” I replied, a little hiccup in my voice could be heard.



“Well, whatchu doin’ here then? We don’t take well to your ‘kind’.”



*“Your kind”? The hell does he mean by that?*



“Just going out to the state park to get some pictures.” I’m now starting to get a little unnerved by the guy, I just wanted some breakfast!

  


The man didn’t respond for a few seconds. He looked like he was thinking. I took this opportunity to get a look inside his truck. I saw his interior was also torn up, like the outside of his truck. Sitting next to him in the passenger seat was a firearm (I don’t know guns, just kind of looked like a hunting rifle). Normally, I wouldn’t think much of it, this guy seems like a hunter. But with the state of his truck and how weird he’s being, some alarms were going off in my head.

  


“Well, just be careful. There’s been some reports of people goin’ missin’ up in them woods. If I were you, I’d be turnin’ back now, while y’ still can.” There was an almost eerie tone to his voice, like he was trying to warn me. But after the “your kind” comment, I didn’t really care about what he had to say.

  


“Alright, well thanks for the advice.” I say, stuffing down the rest of my breakfast. The guy just stared back, as if he was trying to bore holes into my skull with his eyes. Eventually, he pulled out and left as quickly as he came.

  


*What a weird ass guy.* I thought to myself. I looked back at Holly and she was sitting up in the backseat, staring towards the diner. I called out her name, but she didn’t move. I went to pet her and she snapped out of it. She seemed a little anxious*. Weird.* What that guy said got me thinking, and so I decided to do some amateur detective work. I hopped out of my car, grabbed Holly and went to the outdoor seating area at the diner to ask some questions. I saw an older woman drinking a cup of black coffee out of a cute porcelain mug, she seemed nice enough. As I was walking towards her, I noticed her eyes, swiftly darting between me and Holly. 

  


“Hi, I just had a few questions. I haven’t been out here in some time and was wondering who that guy was in that beat up red truck?”

  


The woman, maybe in her late 60’s, sat her cup down and looked up at me with warm, brown eyes that mirrored her coffee. Her white hair slowly cascading down to her shoulders. She had an odd familiarity about her, but I couldn’t pinpoint it.

  


“That was Reggie. He’s kind of an odd guy, always goin’ around town hootin’ and hollerin’ ‘bout how the government is lyin’ and that they puttin’ microchips and whatnot in our brains to turn us into a zombie army or whatever. Most folk here don’t pay him much mind, but when he finds someone he don’t recognize, he’ll sure as hell try to freak ‘em out.”

  


Yeah, that makes sense, he seemed crazy. I’m all for conspiracy theories but that’s a bit much.

  


“Okay, and he said something about people going missing up at the state park down the road, what did he mean by that?”

  


The woman got really quiet. She took a sip of her coffee, set it back down, and looked deep into her mug.



	

“Oh, he was prolly just tryin’ to scare ya. You seem like a capable man, I wouldn’t worry too much ‘bout it.” She gave a soft and warm smile, her teeth stained yellow from years of coffee and probably smoking.

  


I thanked her for her time and walked back to my car. She sounded genuine about her last statement, but her facial expressions and body language gave off the feeling that she was scared, or worried. As I started my car back up again and looked up, the woman was staring right at me. I gave her a smile and a wave but she just stared back, motionless and expressionless. I felt like her gaze would swallow me whole.

  


I drove down a winding road, through leafless trees with the dying leaves flowing behind my car. Eventually, I made it to the parking area, pulled into a spot and began to gather my things. It’s around 8 AM at this point, and there were a few other cars around. Nothing out of the ordinary, people come here a lot to hike or exercise. I got out and felt the cool autumn breeze rush past me. It’s soothing, lifting the worries I had on my drive here away. I let Holly out and take her off leash. She’s really good about staying with me and I keep the leash on me, ready to attach it in case another dog comes. I take my camera out of my bag and begin snapping some photos of the area, testing the lens and making sure I have the settings right. 

  


One of the cars in the lot looks familiar. It’s Reggie’s truck, banged up and scratched to all hell. It's pretty recognizable so I know for a fact that he’s here. I snapped a few pictures of it. I’m not really sure why, maybe because of how weird our conversation was. I do notice something odd about it though. When I made my way up to it, I noticed that his gun, which was sitting in the passenger seat next to him, was gone. That made me uneasy, an old guy walking around a forest trail with a whole ass rifle? But I dunno, maybe there’s some back trails that he uses for hunting. At least I hoped.

  


As I begin to walk towards the main trail, I feel a rush of uneasiness wash over me, like a wave of freezing cold water. I stare down the path with the trees arching over it, like a monstrous maw about to devour me whole. Then a pair of joggers walk past me, talking about their run this morning. That snaps me out of my daze that I was trapped in, and I quickly shrug it off. My mind is telling me to drop everything and leave, that I shouldn’t be here. But I want to do this, I *need* to. And so, I begin to take my first steps onto the trail.

  


It’s a pretty nice walk. It’s paved in most areas, a pretty easy trail for practically anyone. Like I said, I'm no avid hiker or outdoorsman so I knew this wouldn’t be too taxing on me. Holly is trotting around, sniffing around for anything to investigate. Every so often a person or two will walk past me, and Holly stops to say hi. She’s such a glutton for attention, but she is pretty cute so I can’t blame anyone for wanting to say hi.

  


I eventually made it to the waterfall I spoke of earlier. The white water cascading down the rocky cliffside, forming a massive pool of clear blue water in the basin. It really is beautiful, especially at this time of year. The blues and whites from the water pairing nicely with the oranges and yellows of the autumn leaves. Nobody else is here, which is kind of odd, especially with the amount of cars that were in the parking lot. This area is a lot bigger than the paths so I let Holly walk around a little farther from me. I take out my camera and begin getting some pictures of the waterfall and the surrounding area. Kneeling down on a rock off to the side, I aim the camera near the basin. *Click!* Though that wasn’t the sound of the camera shutter, it sounded like a rifle being cocked. I look up from out of my camera’s viewfinder and see Reggie, all the way at the top of the waterfall. Looking down at me, gun in hand.



	

“Holy shit, you scared the hell out of me!” I shouted, trying to make light of the situation, despite the fact this man is armed with a firearm.



	

“I told ya not to come here, boy.” He sneered and spit down on the ground next to him. 



	

“Why? There were a bunch of other people here, why can’t I come?” I was starting to get annoyed. Why does he not want *me* to come here so badly?



	

“You felt it, didn't ya? The pull to come here. You couldn’t explain why, you just needed to, right?” His voice was low, and really ominous. How did he know? I took a second to gather my thoughts.

	



“...yeah, I suppose.” I replied, a little wary of how we would respond.



	

Reggie took a second, like he was thinking, then said: “Come up here, boy. I wanna show ya somethin’.”

  


Reggie slung his rifle over his shoulder. What is this guy’s deal? First he’s threatening me, and now he’s trying to be friends? He’s going to kill me, I just know it. Reggie is going to shoot me dead and leave my body to become ravaged by the fungal growth, assimilating with my withered corpse…

  


*What the hell am I thinking?* I shake the thoughts out of my head, and call Holly over to me, leashing her up and finding a safe way up the cliff face. I remember having these thoughts when I was younger, but they were just nightmares. 

  


I eventually make it to the top, slipping and tripping all the way, and see Reggie, his back to me, crouched over something.



	

“So, what did-”

  


Reggie holds his hand up, and cuts me off:



	

“*It’s close, we have to be quiet.”*

  


He gestures to me to come over. I slink over, not even thinking why I need to be quiet, and take a look. It’s a pile of animal corpses, all mutilated and bloodied. Bones shattered and heads torn asunder. I step back and gag, almost throwing up. But I compose myself, and that’s when I notice, growing amidst the heap of gore: tiny mushroom caps, consuming the decaying mass of bodies. Just like in my dreams and visions. 



	

“*What did this?*” I ask him, in a hushed voice.



	

“*The Beast. I been huntin’ it for over a decade now, and ‘round these parts, the thing is like a ghost. Once you spot it, the thing takes off and vanishes.”*

  


What he said sent a chill down my spine, and I think even Holly could tell, she started whining and panting real hard. What the hell did he mean by that? I’ve been here before and never even heard of such a story. This sounds like some shit you’d hear in a movie or something.



	

“*I haven’t heard of it, maybe just some coyotes or wolves  did this?*” Despite the fact I photograph wildlife, I don’t really know all that much about animals.



	

“*No. Wolves and the like always eat their prey. This thing likes to toy with it, play with it. It never eats what it kills, only displays it in its territory.*” Reggie sounded serious. I thought he’s just trying to scare me so I never came back, but he sounded like *he* was scared. 



	

“*Well, have you seen it?”* I asked, thinking he might be mistaking it for a bear or something.



	

“*Yes. It tore up my truck and almost killed me. The thing is ‘bout 20 feet tall, maybe more. It's got these massive claws, sharp as razors, and huge, long fangs comin’ out from its mouth. It’s body seems to be a mass of plants, or mushrooms, I don’t really know.*”



	

“*Okay… do you know anything else about it?*”

  


“*I don’t think it likes canines. I’ve never seen it kill wolves or nothin’. If I were huntin’ it, and somethin’ started howlin’, it would just vanish.”*



*“Huh, well maybe we should just get-”*

  


Reggie cuts me off:



	

“*No, we have to get to my cabin, it’s already got our scent. You’re stuck with me now kid.*”

  


Great. I tried to object but he just stared back at me. His eyes darted everywhere. I could tell he was frightened.

  


I followed Reggie through twisted brambles and fallen trees for maybe 15 minutes. I’m not really sure. But it’s just now I've noticed that my head is starting to hurt. I normally get headaches when I overexert myself, but this is different. It’s like a knife is being plunged into my brain stem, and whoever is wielding it is playing around with it, not trying to kill me, but torture me. If only they would drive it in, deep into the soft, squishy gray matter, splattering the brains everywhere and leaving a horrific mess of gore to be consumed by the underbrush. The ravenous fungi- 

  


There it is again. The thoughts of murder, blood, and entrails. What the hell is going on? Everytime those thoughts appear, tiny red trails appear at the edge of my vision, and I get this insatiable feeling to be consumed. Not eaten by another person. But by nature. To decompose and return to the loam of the earth, and become a part of the cycle of nature. I’m no psychopath. Is it these woods that’s doing it to me? Or could it be…



	

“We’re here.” Reggie walks up to the door to his cabin, unlocks it, and walks inside. I had been so out of it, lost in my thoughts that I was just on autopilot, and didn’t even notice it. It’s dilapidated. The harsh elements of wintertime have worn away the wooden walls. He doesn’t seem to come here often. I don’t even know where we are anymore, I can tell Holly is getting anxious. I kneel down and pet her, trying to calm her down.



	

“I know girl, I’m scared too. We’ll get going soon, I promise.” I whisper to her, giving her a soft kiss on top of her head. 

  


I step in through the almost collapsed doorway and into the cabin. It’s small, one giant room with a cot, a wood-burning stove, a table with a chair, and some camping supplies. Reggie stands over the table, looking down at a map laid across it. I sit down and take a look. The map appears to show the area of the park. It’s a lot bigger than what I remembered. And etched across it in red marker are a few X’s.



	

“This here is a map of the area. These X’s are spots where I’ve encountered the beast. And this here is where we are.”

  


Reggie points at a circle, I noticed something odd though. All of the X’s form a circle around his cabin. No, not a circle, a spiral. Reggie points at the outermost X.



	

“This was my first encounter with it. I was drivin’ down the road and the thing ran out from the forest. I almost hit it, but swerved into tree. It then ran up on me and attacked my truck. I got out and ran, and it eventually ran too. Ever since, I’ve had that strange pull towards this place, that feeling that I need to be here. Like you do.”

  


I stayed quiet, pondering. *Have I seen this creature before? Is that why I feel like I need to come back?*



	

“So, do you think I encountered this ‘beast’ before?” I asked. I felt stupid even entertaining the idea.



	

“Mhmm. I believe this thing, whatever it is, wherever it’s from, drives a nail into one’s mind, making them come back to it, so that it can do…. Whatever it does with people.”



	

“So you still don’t know why it kills?” I asked Reggie. He just shook his head.



	

“Nope. But I gotta ask” Reggie narrowed his eyes and leaned down towards me. “Are you gettin’ thoughts? Thoughts of hurtin’ yerself or others?” 

  


I could tell this question made him anxious, like he was preparing himself for my answer.



	

“...no, not that I can think of.” I lied, I just had a feeling he would shoot me right then and there.



	

“Good, cuz once you do, the beast has gotten too deep in your thoughts and it’ll do somethin’. I dunno what but I know it’s prolly not good.” Reggie stood back up and walked over to a small lockbox next to his cot, opened it up and turned towards me.



	

“You’re gon’ need this. We’re goin’ out and killin’ that thing once and for all.” I looked down inside the box and saw a pistol. I was shocked. I’ve never held a gun before, let alone shot one. I think Reggie could tell.



	

“I can’t be the only one with a gun out there, and plus if I die, you gotta be able to protect yourself, kid. Take it.”

  


I grasp the cold, metallic gun and look at it. My heart dropped into my stomach. I can’t do this. I won’t do it.

  


“Kid, you good?” Reggie asked. I shake myself and come to. I nod and stand up.



	

“Can I leave my dog here? I don’t want her getting hurt.” I asked Reggie. He nodded and brought a bowl with some water and gave it to her.

  


I kneel down and give Holly a kiss and a hug.



	

“I’ll be back girl, I promise.”

  
  
  


We had been walking for what felt like an eternity. It was already around 2 PM. I checked my phone a few times, but with the reception out here being so bad, I didn’t have any hope of calling or texting anyone for help.



Reggie had told me that we were going to follow its trail. The creature seems to leave some sort of path in its wake. Wasn’t sure what he meant by that, but it made sense when we got to it. The trail was maybe 10 feet wide, winding and twisting its way through the brush. Normally, I would have just chalked this up to some old hiking trail that never saw use in over a decade. But, the path seemed to be composed entirely out of various fungi.



I was starting to get lost in thought, just staring deep into the odd walkway of mushrooms. The image of falling into it, letting the growth take over my body. Dissolving my existence away into nothingness…

  


“Look kid…” Reggie spoke, his voice trailing off for a second, breaking the silence of the hike.

  


“I hadn’t been completely honest with ya.” *Oh great, is he gonna tell me how I’m eternally fucked?* I thought. My mind raced with thoughts, but I kept my mouth shut, waiting for Reggie to speak.

  


“Now, I *did* see the beast that night on the road. But it wadn’t just me in my truck. My son was also with me.” His voice croaked with the last few words being spoken.

  


“Yeah? Is… is he okay?” I sheepishly asked, knowing full well I knew what his answer would be.

  


“...No. He died that night. The Beast grabbed him. It tore him apart.” I could tell Reggie was about to cry. It seemed like this night still played on repeat in his mind.

  


“Shit, I’m really sorry.” I responded. I had no idea what to even say. “What was his name?”

  


“Danny. Loved comin’ out with me on my huntin’ trips. Though never had a real compassion for it, just loved nature I s’pose.” Reggie’s voice was shaky and shuddering. I don’t think he’s ever told anyone.

  


“Sounded like a nice kid, Reggie.” I was feeling incredibly uncomfortable now. I was never great with consoling people, let alone when it came to the death of a child.

  


“...yeah. He was. Loved him to death.”

  


Reggie sighed and composed himself.

  


“Now I spend every wakin’ moment trying to avenge him. That thing won’t get away, not now.” Reggie seemed almost invigorated. 



	

“So… what’s the plan?” I asked Reggie.

	



“We find it. We kill it.” He replied.

  


*Fantastic plan you got there Reggie.* I was already getting thoughts that we were screwed. The thing was gonna jump on us at any moment and we were done for. 

  


Reggie taught me how to use the pistol as we were walking and it helped me feel a little more confident, but knowing what we’re going up against doesn’t help whatsoever.



	

“So when we do find it, we just start shooting? Or what?”



	

“No, we’re gon’ talk to it, have some coffee and make friends. Of course we gon’ shoot it!” I could tell Reggie seemed frustrated.

  


“I been followin’ this trail for the past year or so.” He said. “With how elusive the beast is, it’s been rather hard tryin’ to find its lair. This trail always just seems to end. Right…”



Reggie’s voice trailed off for a second, as he was still following the path the creature took.

  


“Here.” He stopped, and pointed down. I didn’t notice what he was showing me, but then I realized. The monster’s tracks ended in a mushroom circle. 

  


“Weird. Animal tracks don’t typically just stop in the middle of them.” I said. Reggie looked over at me and nodded.

  


“This is the reason why I haven’t been able to get this thing. These tracks seem to just stop, with the beast vanishin’ into thin air.” Reggie’s voice got really quiet near the end, and he dropped to the ground and pulled up his rifle.

  


“Now be quiet, I hear somethin’.” At first I didn’t know what he was talking about, but then I heard it too. Whispering maybe? No, too loud. But not loud enough to be talking. But even if it was, it didn’t sound like any language I knew. Just kind of sounded like gibberish, coming from a cluster of trees just ahead of us. Reggie held up his rifle and peered through the scope. I tried to get a better look but couldn’t see much through the thick foliage.

  


Suddenly, I felt a tap on my shoulder, opposite Reggie, and a strong force hit the back of my skull and everything went dark.

  
  


I wasn’t sure how long I was out for. I had some pretty haunting dreams. The sensation of peeling the flesh from my body, like skinning a soft potato. Ripping out my organs and consuming them, ravenously, as if I had never eaten before. Other people were surrounding me, all humming that same gibberish chant, in a vast expansive void. 

  


I’m slapped awake, and notice I’m in another cabin, tied to a wooden post nailed to the back wall. I look over and see Reggie, still and lifeless on the floor, tied up just like me. I take a second to gather myself, the light from the candles burning around the room, burning my retinas. Then, I realized that someone was standing over me.

  


“Who are you? And how did you get here?” the person speaks, in *almost* perfect english. It sounds like they have an accent, Germanic? Maybe Scandinavian? I couldn’t really tell, but I *know* that people from the midwest don’t have those accents.

  


I groggily blink my eyes and lick my lips. “I.. uh… I’m not… sure…” I reply, still a bit out of it from the blunt force trauma to my skull, which I can now feel the cold trickle of blood streaming down the back of my neck.

  


“I will ask again. Who. Are. You?” the person repeated, seemingly unsatisfied with my answer. I eventually told them my name, and that I came here with my dog to just take some pictures, but got wrapped up in something with Reggie. 

  


I try to get a good look at the person standing over me, but their face is covered with some burlap sack, stained with blood. They’re wearing some old outfit, like something you’d see back in the medieval times. Like some dark wool tunic and weather-worn trousers.

  


The person stands back up, and another walks in, wearing another burlap sack over their head. They walk over to Reggie, and kick the side of his chest. He coughs and rouses from his unconsciousness. The two people then start conversing in some language that I can’t understand. It sort of sounds European, but I just can’t figure out where.

  


The first person walks back over to me, and unties me from the board I was restrained to, leaving my hands still bound. They lift me up and begin to walk me out of the cabin, along with Reggie.

  


Walking through the doorway, what I thought was only an hour or so, turned out to be maybe 5 or 6, with it being completely dark out. We appear to be in some kind of camp, with two other wooden buildings. In the center, is a circle of candles, and a long wooden pole, maybe 30 feet high, that stands in the center of the ring. 2 other people are standing just on the outside of the candles, humming to themselves.

  


The person walking Reggie takes him to the center, whilst I am held back. They tie him up to the pole, slap him a little to make sure that he is awake, and then take a few steps back so they are outside of the circle, and also begin to hum.

  


The person shoves me down to the ground, and stands on my feet. I’m completely trapped. I could try to run, but I have no idea where I am, and if any of these people are armed. I knew I’d be screwed, so I just went along with it. 

  


One of the people began to start chanting something. It’s that same chanting that Reggie and I had heard earlier, before we were taken. I still can’t figure out what they’re saying, but it seems like a few English words break through. Something like “Harvest” or “Decay” but I’m not too sure. And there’s one word that stands out to me, it almost sounded like a name, *Disir*? I’m not sure.

  


The chanting was getting louder and louder, a crescendo of voices all collapsing into one harmonious song. Then, it all stops suddenly. A quiet wind blows through the camp, with the only sound coming from Reggie and his ragged breathing. 

  


I spot something in the trees lining the camp. It definitely wasn’t there before. A massive creature, maybe 15 feet in height, its eyes reflecting back the light from the candles, with the rest of its body cloaked in shadow. And that’s when I feel it, the light-headedness that I felt years ago when I was here with my family. Have I seen the creature? I couldn’t have, it’s massive and I definitely would have known if I had seen something like that. I look around nervously at the others. They don’t seem to notice. Rather, they are intentionally not looking at it, all with their heads bowed in silent prayer.

  


Then, in a flash, the creature is suddenly in the center of the camp, and now I can finally get a good look at it. It seems to be some sort of conglomeration of plants and fungi. Its massive, tree-trunk-like legs hold up its almost elephant-like body, with each three-toed foot ending in long, sickle-like talons. It has a thick neck that ends in a huge mass of circular mushrooms where a head would be, with several antlers jutting out from the top of it in unnatural ways. Two, beady black orbs for eyes stare down at Reggie as spindly “arms” unfurl from its body and grasp the sides of his head. 

  


Reggie begins to scream, the only sound coming from him that tells me he is aware of what's going on. The creature slides him up the pole so he is eye level with it. A loud, tearing sound can be heard as the creature’s “head” splits in two vertically, straight down the middle. Two rows of jagged and serrated teeth jut out from the maw. Then, a faint, pale green light seems to emanate from the mouth of the creature. As Reggie stares into it, he stops screaming, and goes limp, staring right back into it, as if he is stuck in a comatose trance. Small tendrils begin to writhe out of the creature’s mouth and wrap around Reggie’s head, before pulling it in. And with a single swift *crunch*, tears his head clean off and drops his body to the ground with a loud ***THUD.***

  


As that happens, the other people begin a loud, discordant prayer, before stopping after a few seconds. Then, the creature looks at me. I felt my stomach drop. 

  


I was next.

  


The person grabs my hands and yanks me towards the pole. I start shouting and screaming, fighting the whole way, but the person’s grip is too strong, and I was too weak and tired. They tied me up to the pole, and the creature had retreated back to the tree line. I didn’t even see it move. They then walk back to the outer ring with the others and they all begin their chant once more.

  


I’m now sobbing hysterically. I don’t want to die. I thought I was a good person in life, I didn’t deserve this. But maybe I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. 

  


The beast was then instantly in front of me. Its small, lanky arms protruding from its body grasped the sides of my head and pulled me up towards it. The same ripping sound can be heard, as its head splits once again. I got a better look now. It’s mouth was a cyclone of fangs, and at the back of it’s “throat” looked to be a… face? A familiar face.

  


It was the old woman at the diner. She was staring right back at me from the cavernous maw. Expressionless, just like before. Where the arms came out from the creature would be where hers would be on her body. *Was she the creature?* She opened her mouth and that same emerald glow returned, coming from her mouth and eyes, and I was instantly in a trance.

  


The tentacles started sprawling out and began to wrap around my head. They were cold, lifeless, and uncaring.

  


Just as I was about to accept my fate, I heard barking in the distance. The light faded as she closed her mouth. The tentacles retreated back into the creature’s maw and it seemed to get scared. It dropped me to the ground and turned to the others.

  


The other people stopped chanting and started shouting to each other in their language, seemingly in shock, anger, and nervousness. They started rushing around, trying to grab whatever they could, but the creature seemed angered with them, as it turned and began to eviscerate everyone else.

  


The creature was fast. Faster than the human eye. With swift movements, the people seemed to just explode into a burst of gore. No screams, no cries of pain or agony, just instant death.

  


Out from the outskirts of camp, the barking grew louder. And as I looked, I was in utter shock. It was Holly! She somehow broke out of Reggie’s cabin and heard my screams. She saw the creature and began barking and snarling at it. It’s almost as if Holly knew it would be scared of her. The creature let out a massive shriek and ran off into the woods.

  


Holly ran over and sat down in front of me, panting and licking my face. I just sat there for a second, sobbing and babbling incoherently. I was finally able to compose myself, and freed my hands from their bindings.

  


Shakily, I stood up and gathered my things. I walked over to the body of Reggie and just stared. It was disgusting, seeing someone decapitated, but I felt sorry for him. I felt responsible for his death even though I knew this probably would have happened to him eventually. 

  


I wanted some answers. *Who were these people? Why are they out here? And what was that thing?*

  


I decided to look through the bodies around me. I didn't find much, but the first person who talked to me had a small journal, in an inner pocket of their tunic. I take it out and examine it. It’s maybe the size of a pocket bible. Leather-bound, and seemingly homemade. On the front, it had a single word carved into it: *Dís.* I began flipping through some of the pages. All of it was in some language that I couldn’t read, but that word kept coming up. I could see runes inscribed on some of the pages. I recognized some of them to be Norse. I slipped it into my pocket.

  


*Norse runes? Are these people from Scandinavia?* What the hell were they doing there?

  


I decided to take a look in the other cabins of the camp, to make sure there was nobody else to come after me. It appeared to be a bunk room, with 8 beds situated on the left and right walls. I only noticed 4 people, where did the others go?

  


I walked over to the last building which was larger than the other two, with massive double wooden doors. Each had a large rune engraved on the front of them. The one with eight lines coming out from the center, and each of them ending in a prong shape? I see people get tattoos of them sometimes. I swung the doors open. The dark chamber beckoned me to enter.

  


Walking inside, this building appeared to be some sort of worship hall. Pews lined the center and at the very back was an altar. On the far back wall, behind the altar, was a mural depicting some woman with long, flowing hair, holding a sickle in one hand, and some grains or wheat in the other. *Is this who they were worshipping? Is this the woman from the diner?*

  


I walked up to the altar and found another book resting on it. This was another leather-bound bible, though nothing was written on the front of it. I flipped it open, and was unpleasantly surprised to find that it was all in that same language. Frustrated, I slammed it shut. I gave a big sigh and left the way I came.

  


Holly seemed anxious to leave. I knelt down to her and gave her some pets, telling her that we’re leaving now.

  


In the distance, I could hear it. The howls of the monster echoing throughout the forest. I know it still was wanting something, but I wasn’t going to stick around to find out.

  
  


The drive home was quiet. Holly was passed out in the back seat, she seemed just as tired as I was. I eventually got reception and a flood of texts and missed calls hounded my phone all from my parents. I called them back, saying I had lost track of time and fell asleep in my car and that I was on my way home. I didn't really know what to tell them, I knew they wouldn’t believe me.

  


Ever since, the nightmares and visions slowly faded away. The influence the beast had on me waned, but whenever I get a glimpse of that journal, I feel that pull to return. With it still being alive, I’m sure it will worm its way back into my skull. Every so often, I think back on that day. I know what I saw, and I know that I shouldn’t have.
