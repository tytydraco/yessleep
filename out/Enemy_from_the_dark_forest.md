“Hey boss, will reach the village in 20 minutes. Get your stuff and get out as soon as I park my boat. I don’t like this place.”

I was used to this kind of talk, being a non-profit doctor, I had to visit several isolated places to check up on the community. The village I was visiting was not part of my usual, it was the second time I was going to visit them. I was asked by a friend who works with the local government to make sure they were vaccinated or at least know nothing bad happened to them. The air in the jungle was thick and the flies made worse, I had to wear a mask just make sure I didn’t breath in those little bastards. The water was murky but what lay within was much worse, I remembered seeing a massive anaconda the first time I visited and the captain laughed saying that maybe a local would not be going home tonight.

It was noon and the heat made it harder to breath, I checked my medicine bag to see if it was sealed and then my travel bag. I saw the primitive dock the captain spoke about and waited for the signal. Once docked I jumped up and turned to receive my bags, the help handed them to me and I placed them down and stood. The captain waved and then turned the boat around to leave. I could not blame him since this place had a habit of eating everything that wasn’t part of the land. I turned to look at the path I was to use then to the jungle around. The flies were much worse and trying to get at my face, I picked up my bags and began my walk.

The path stopped maybe 60 feet from the dock and after that it was all memory that guided me to the village. I made sure to place markers when I first visited and I was glad I did that since the rain washed away chalk marks but nailed in flag remained. I followed the path listening to the sounds of the forest, what made this visit unnerving was the feeling that something was off and I could not tell. Getting close to the village I could feel the heaviness in the air, there was a coppery smell in the air that I attributed to old blood. Thinking that the village must be in the middle of a slaughter I moved forward to the opening that led to the village.

Once in the clearing I could see the village, nestled under large trees, and there was still some smoke coming from the place. Looking around to see if there was any indication on why I was still getting the coppery taste in my mouth I could not find the source. I began walking to the village while avoiding pools that dotted the open marsh. Looking up to see birds flying in a circular motion I realised that they were doing so above the village that brought the feeling of dread in me. I hastened to the village to see if someone needed my help and when I reached my heart dropped at the sight before me.

There was a tree at the centre of the village where the people would hold official meetings and other activities, it was the centre of everything they worked from. I stood there looking at the tree now, from it hung bodies, they were hung lower to the ground which was why I did not see them from further away. What made things worse was that each and every hanging body had their bellies cut open, spilling out their insides onto the ground. This was what the birds were feasting upon, there were other animals also feasting on the grisly buffet. I fell to my knees and removed the net hat to throw up, the entire scene was something out of a nightmare. As I tried to breath I looked at the small huts these people lived in, they were untouched and nothing in the area looked like they were attacked. I got up and pulled out my satellite phone to call for help, I knew that whoever had done this might still be around.

I dropped the bags and started looking around to see if there were any survivors or something to tell me what happened here. The phone took longer to start since I was in the middle of a rain forest and coverage here was very spotty. I checked the first few houses and then made my way to the tree. I hated to go there but I needed to know, there was a jaguar in the mix enjoying the free meal so I shot in the air a couple of times to scare off the animals and birds. If there was someone around, they would attack but with a jaguar also prowling gave me some hope that whoever did this is long gone.

I began to check the bodies and see who could have done this, the first set of bodies I checked I could see slashes. The slashes were done with a rough blade, something like a serrated blade. Putting on gloves while checking the perimeter for that jaguar and other animals I examined the wounds closely and could see that the blade was a bone type since there were pieces of it in the stomach. I could no longer take the smell and the scene so I retreated to an open area so I could gather my thoughts. This was too much and I knew that I needed to get out of here as soon as I can. There was no other way I could go so I had to take my chances, I checked the pistol I carried and extra bullets I had on hand. Enough for the while and with the fading light I needed to find a place to hide and wait until the evacuation.

I tried to call my contact back in the city and was not getting a clear signal, so made my way back to the open area and tried again. I got him and explained the situation roughly and told I need to get out of here immediately. He told me that it would take 4 hours or more because he was the only one who knew exactly where I was, I had to find a way to hunker down and hope whoever attacked the village does not return. I had no choice but to wait now so I accepted and hung up.

I went back to the hut I was in and sat there and waited. I wasn’t long before I heard foot falls of something prowling around the hut, I braced to fire only to find it was just a monkey sniffing around. It saw me and scuttled away, there were more that did the same. I remained wary of every sound until I felt the sudden silence, there was a fine mist making its way past the door and it looked like a carpet of smoke. I checked the time and it was still 3 hours to go, I tightened my grip and sat there waiting.

I heard their voices before the footsteps, a shrill howling pierced the night. Through the buzzing of flies I heard them, they were close and I raised my pistol. Multiple footfalls could be heard coming from outside, I could no gauge the direction. I remained still waiting for whoever it was, finally with the help of moonlight I saw a shadow crawl its way past the door. It was passed the door and I saw the figure pass the opening slowly as if looking for something. I remained as quiet as I could, then another passed the opening but this one stopped to look inside. The face that I saw looked like the rest of the villagers but his eyes were sunken in and his forehead was larger, his nose pulsed every time he sniffed the air then his lips receded to reveal large teeth. I could see his face turn from curious to angry slowly, my eyes had adjusted to the gloom. He raised his hand that held a blade and in the moonlight I could see it was a large and curved rib bone. I remained silent waiting for him to move but he turned suddenly hearing something and dashed out. I let out a silent breath in relief, I checked my phone and saw a message. My contact was on his way, I messaged him back saying the attackers had returned.

I heard another noise outside and I braced for an attack, a low growl was heard and I knew it was a jaguar. I saw the shadow fly past the opening and then more howls followed, it looks like the hunter and hunted were finally meeting. A figure rushed past the opening and then another but this one was set upon by the jaguar and I saw it bite down on the head. With a crunch it pierced the head of the person, I heard more howls and then a spear hit the ground near the beast. It raised its head and let out a loud growl and rushed forward, more sounds of scuffles then growls. After a few minutes I hear the jaguar growl only to be cut off, I knew they killed it because just after that a howl was heard. Only one voice was heard, the figure came into view to check the fallen one and then tried to pick up the body.

The head turned and he looked right at me, he barred his teeth and tried to rush at me. I fired a round at him and it pushed him back, he looked at himself confused then at me. Again he tried to rush forward and I fired again this time hitting him on the neck. He staggered back ward grasping at his neck, the sound of air escaping his neck and gurgling of blood from his mouth the man dropped down twitching. I then heard someone run forward and something flew out of the gloom and hit my left hand, it was spear and I shouted in pain. I looked at the opening saw another one rush forward, delirious with pain I fired at the new figure, I did not know if I hit him. Pulling the short spear out and looked at it seeing that it was also a sharpened bone, these were also forest dwellers but they were more primitive.

I wrapped my wound while keeping an eye at the opening, I did not hear anything but knew there may be more outside. This hut was not safe but outside was much worse, I checked the time and I was still an hour away from rescue. I tried to staunch the bleeding and keep myself from getting dizzy, I drank some water and waited. I had no idea what was going to happen next.

A few minutes passed and there was no movement outside, still I remained. The heat was making the pain worse, and I knew the smell of blood would attract even more flies, the worse would be the bot flies. Nothing came, I waited still, finally I heard footsteps coming closer. I waited to see, it was another one of the attackers and he looked down at the fallen figure then at one inside, he saw me and barred his teeth at me then rushed forward, I fired again and hit him in the eye. I was getting weary of camping here and just firing at these primitive attackers, they were simple minded folk. I tried to understand why they would attack the village and hang them up, these guys were too simple minded for such an elaborate display of aggression.

I heard a deafening roar of something outside, it was so loud the hut shook. I did not want to move but knew that I might have to figure out something in case this thing attacked the hut. I waited but nothing came, then I heard whispers of some dialect I had never heard before. I did not hear any footsteps or howls to indicate there was anyone outside, I waited still. Finally I realised that I was minutes from hearing the chopper I moved, my feet felt heavy from being in one position for so long. I tried to get some blood running and checked my wound, I needed to get out of here but be as quiet as I could. Then I heard the voice from outside, it was a woman’s voice chanting something. There was a light coming from the tree of corpses and it was getting brighter, I peaked out to check and there was no one around. Finally I stepped out to see the tree was engulfed in flames, I stood there mesmerised at the sight of it. At the base was a figure of a woman, she stood there with her arms raised to the sky staring at the blaze before her. She was shouting out chants and from where I stood I could see she was completely naked apart from a belt she wore around her stomach.

I looked toward the sky to see if I could see the approaching chopper but could not see it yet, I turned to check on the woman and could see she was still there. Finally after a few minutes she just walked into the blaze, I saw the flames enshroud her like a blanket as she walked into the fore. I could no believe what I saw and now realised that how hot it really was, the blaze was large and I needed to get as far away from here at possible. I tried to call my contact but it wasn’t getting through, I looked up at the sky as I ran finally saw the light shifting above the trees. I heard it approaching, I guessed they did not need a location from me since the burning tree behind me was enough. I turned to see the scene and it was there I saw the figure before the fire. It was further away from the fire and it was dressed in a long robe, what stood out was the colour of the robe. The figure was just standing there looking at the blaze, it was wearing a yellow robe.
