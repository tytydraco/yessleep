I used to think that moving into my first apartment alone would be freedom, the start of a new chapter. The place was old but cozy, nestled in a quiet corner of town. Nothing too fancy, but it was all mine. I’d only been there a week when the noises began.

It started with a faint scratching. At first, I chalked it up to the old building. Creaking pipes, maybe, or rats. I reported it to the landlord, who gave me a look of polite concern but promised they’d send someone to check. Days went by, and the scratching grew louder, more constant, always in the early hours of the morning. No one came.

I started losing sleep. I’d lie in bed with a pillow over my ears, desperate for the silence to return, but instead, it seemed to get closer, more insistent. One night, I couldn’t take it anymore. I got up and pressed my ear to the vent in my bedroom wall, trying to pinpoint the source. My heart pounded as I listened to the steady scraping, like nails clawing at metal. Then it stopped, and I swear, just for a moment, I heard breathing.

The next day, I tried calling the landlord again, but no one picked up. I went down to the building's front office, but the lights were off, a "Closed for Repairs" sign taped to the door. I hadn't seen my neighbors much, but now I was wondering if they’d heard anything strange, too. I knocked on a few doors, but no one answered.

That night, the noises changed. No more scratching, this time, I heard a voice. A low, muffled whisper echoing from inside the vent. I couldn’t make out the words, but it sounded… angry. I backed away, feeling a cold sweat prickling down my back. Something was inside the walls, something aware. I could feel its eyes on me, its breath hot and close, like it knew I was listening.

In the morning, I found strange marks around the edges of the vent cover in the bathroom. Tiny scratches, almost like claw marks. But that wasn't the worst part. As I leaned in to inspect them, I caught a faint smell, damp and rotten, like something decaying. I gagged and stumbled back, covering my nose.

Desperate for help, I reached out to my family. My mom tried to reassure me that it was just my imagination, but I could hear the unease in her voice. No one could shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong. That night, I sealed my bedroom vent with tape and tried to sleep.

But it wasn’t enough. Sometime around 2 a.m., I heard something scraping along the walls behind my bed. Louder this time. Closer. I held my breath, frozen, as it dragged itself around the perimeter of the room. The air felt thick, oppressive, and I could almost feel the presence outside my wall. Then, the whispering began again, faint but unmistakable, like someone hissing from the other side of the wall.

“Let me in…”

I bolted upright, scrambling to turn on my lamp. The room filled with light, and the noises stopped. Everything went silent. I tried to calm myself, but I could feel something watching, lurking just beyond the wall. I didn’t sleep that night.

The next day, I packed a bag and left. I couldn’t take it anymore. I found a hotel for the night and promised myself I’d find a new place as soon as I could. But just as I was about to turn out the lights, I heard it. The same scratching sound. The same faint, hissing whisper.

It had followed me.
