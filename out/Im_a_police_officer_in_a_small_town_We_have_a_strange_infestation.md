I remember my father taking me to the circus when I was very young. I liked the smell of popcorn and sawdust and all the bright lights and the noises the elephants made - what sound does an elephant make? Anyway, I never cared much for the clowns. Something about the red lipstick slashed across bone-white faces made me think about skeletons. Skeletons that ate little boys.

Around that time, John Wayne Gacy was arrested (“The Killer Clown”) a hundred miles away from where I grew up and he really did eat little boys, in a manner of speaking. My father never took me to the circus again and I guess a lot of clowns hung up their red noses. My father joked that Gacy did for clowns what Jaws did for sharks. He had a bad sense of humor.

About three months ago, I left Chicago PD and brought my family to a small town in the countryside. Figured I’d earned it after almost twenty-five years of being shot at by junkies. My wife was very happy with the converted farmhouse we’d bought and I was very happy with the lieutenant position at the local police department. It’s a nice town. Not very prosperous, but the people are real friendly. I grew up in a house that didn’t have much except for kindness, so that suits me just fine.

We don’t get many call-outs that can’t be handled with an open ear and a firm voice. Mostly nuisance neighbors with noise complaints and boundary disputes. Angry drunks who need a night in the cells to cool off. One of my first calls was about a black bear, which I thought was pretty scary, until it turned out to be a man in a dog costume, which made the whole department hoarse with laughter.

That all changed last week. I was driving back into town after seeing about an abandoned car. It was real dark and there was nothing on either side of the road but fields. Then my headlights hit a funny-looking guy standing in the middle of the road. I swerved to avoid him and hit a wooden telegraph pole, hitting the brakes just in time to avoid plastering the dash with my brains.

It was still a pretty violent stop. I was pretty sure I’d broken my nose and my head hurt, so much that I couldn’t do much except sit and pant. I heard dirt crunching outside as the guy on the road stepped off the road and approached my window. I turned my head. Wish I hadn’t.

He was a fucking clown. Red lipstick slashed across a bone-white face. His fat cheeks were powdered pink and long, greasy orange hair fell out from under his bowler hat. He even had the big red nose, but it wasn’t a prop - this clown had a lumpy red tumor for a nose. Dressed like a railway hobo from a Chaplin film, with a giant wilted sunflower pinned to his lapel.

Guy just stared at me. No, “*Jeez mister, you okay?*” And then he pulled his lips back, revealing a set of teeth so crooked and black that most of them had fallen out. The bastard was **grinning** at me, at the man he could’ve killed. And then he walked away.

The next thing I remember, I was in a hospital bed. My wife was fast asleep in the chair next to me, holding my hand, but I was more interested in the voices coming from the hallway: the Chief (my boss) and Doc, a man so old that he’d been delivering babies since the Bay of Pigs.

“*They’re breeding again*,” Chief said.

“*These things come and go,*” Doc replied.

“*Yeah, but we know what happens before they go,*” Chief pointed out. “*Remember ‘16?*”

“*I try not to,*” said Doc.

Whatever Doc had given me lulled me back to sleep. I think I dreamed about elephants. The next morning, I was discharged. Just a broken nose, two fractured ribs and a mild concussion. Doc joked that I’d never play college ball again and I asked him if the town had a nearby circus I could join instead. Doc didn’t appreciate the joke.

I went into the Chief’s office and asked if anyone had seen the clown. He told me no. I asked if anyone had even gone looking. He said he didn’t appreciate my tone and implied that I’d hallucinated the whole thing - he was so convincing that I truly considered the possibility, apologizing to him.

But then I remembered the abandoned car. The whole reason I was so far out of town in the first place. There hadn’t been anything inside, except for a glove box full of loose popcorn. I’d opened that glove box and a whole bunch of popcorn fell out. Found a human tooth in there, too. Rotten.

As it turned out, the owner had been found in a nearby field while I was being taken to hospital. I called the coroner and asked about the body and the coroner told me that the owner had choked on a bunch of handkerchiefs. I asked him what the hell he meant and the coroner said that he’d pulled a length of sewed-together handkerchiefs out of the owner’s throat. Six feet long. Crazy thing is how unsurprised the coroner sounded, like he’d dealt with this before.

Later that day, one of our call handlers went to the emergency room. Someone had left a box of chocolates on her desk and every one of them had a razor blade inside. She’s fine, but slicing up a police call handler’s tongue struck me as a sick joke.

The next morning, an 86 year old woman at the nursing home went to the coroner’s office, instead. Someone had replaced her oxygen tank with nitrous oxide, triggering a heart attack. Nitrous oxide. Laughing gas.

The rest of the day was chaos. Someone had tampered with main street’s stoplights, causing an eight vehicle pileup, including a ten-wheeler. Three drivers died before the ambulances arrived. A fourth died on their way to the emergency room. The whole town came to a damn standstill and we had to break up fistfights between the families of the deceased. Our youngest officer pulled his gun and I had to wrestle him to the ground before he could start a riot. It was a deeply unpleasant sort of chaos, the kind that leaves a man wondering if he’d be able to go home to his family.

After that debacle, things quietened down for a couple days. I never found out who’d fucked the stoplights, because footage from nearby cameras had been pulled by the Chief. I wondered if it was time to call in the FBI, but after last night, I think a priest might be more suitable.

Someone had called about a murder scene just outside the woods, a mile or so away from the field where I’d crashed. When we got there, the officer with me, the boy who’d pulled his gun on a crowd of angry mourners, burst into tears. Two nineteen year old’s. One had been disemboweled, his belly sliced open. A pile of steaming guts piled nearby. The face of the other boy had been sliced off and sewn over the disemboweled boy’s own face. The faceless boy had an awful red grin. The disemboweled boy didn’t very much look human at all.

I went looking in the woods with a flashlight and a handgun. The young officer stayed near the car, sobbing and vomiting - he knew the victims, friends of his brother. Good kids. Pot smokers. Harmless. I might be a bit old-fashioned, but even I knew this wasn’t about drugs. This was about all the other crap that had been happening since I’d swerved to avoid that clown.

It didn’t take me long to find the third boy, on account of the fact that he was naked, sitting on a tree stump and covered head to toe in the blood of his friends. His eyes looked like shards of glass, staring out of all that slick red blood.

I lowered the gun immediately, even before he said, **“It wasn’t me. I didn’t do it.”** He said that over and over, as I walked him back, hands on his shoulders. **“It wasn’t me. I didn’t do it.”** Shaking.

“*I know, son,*” was all I said. Over and over. “*I know.*”

I found a blanket in the trunk and put it around him. Put him in the back of the car, but left the door open. Told him that he wasn’t in trouble, that we all just needed a few minutes to clear our heads. And then he **laughed**. It was quiet at first, like a cough that he couldn’t contain, but then stared me right in the eye and **laughed**, white teeth in a sea of red, rocking back and forth and back and forth and **laughing** and howling and shrieking and **laughing**.  

And he burst out of the car. Running. **~~Laughing~~**. Full sprint towards the young officer. The third boy fell before I heard the gunshot. The young officer fell before I heard the second gunshot. I got home late last night, after all the paperwork was done. Hugged my daughter. Told my wife I loved her. I fell asleep clutching the toilet bowl, with no more tears left to give.

It’s true that Chicago hardens a man. It’s not as bad it used to be but it’s still pretty damn rough if you know where to go, but the fact is that this town, with its two gas stations and one grocery store, has seen nine homicides in under a week. Ten, if you count the young officer. I do. I left Chicago because I don’t feel as hard as I used to and now I’m feeling pretty damn weak.

I didn’t go into work today and nobody’s called me about my absence. This morning, I told my wife to take our daughter to the movies and get ice cream afterwards, at the bowling alley. Just be somewhere busy, I told her. I drove out to the woods with my shotgun and spent a couple of hours trying to find whatever had murdered those boys.

Underneath an old oak tree, I found an enormous ball of cotton candy, the size of a hay bale. It was split down the side and a pinkish, sugary-smelling fluid was oozing out. There were hand prints in the fluid. Something had crawled out. I also found a half-buried sign, probably a hundred years old or so, pointing towards a coal mine that I didn’t know existed.

Earlier, I bathed my daughter and put her to bed and she asked me if I’d stopped any bad guys today and I lied and told her yes. About an hour ago, I passed her room and heard her giggling. I opened the door and asked her what she was giggling about. She told me that Mr Hoot wanted to show her his kite, but she’d have to climb out of the window to see it.

Oh, yeah? What does Mr Hoot look like?

*He’s got a red nose*, she told me. *A big red nose.*
