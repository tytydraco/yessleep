Do you want to have your stories turned into Youtube videos?  
Share on this comment your best stories and add any photo or video that is connected to the story and I will let you know once the video is uploaded to go and watch it and of course I will credit the person who wrote the story  
The channel is about scary stories. It's just a started but I'm planning to grow it and hopefully to server to community with the best stories the people from this community tell to turn them into videos so even more people can watch and hear them  .  
I cannot do this by myself so for that I would need your help on this to support me with your stories and footage that support that story and the editing and voice will be professional.  
  
Again, you will be credited for the stories that I turn into videos where whatever name or page you want to mention will be on the video.   
This is all I can offer for the moment so I'm hoping for your support.
