I really wanted to believe that nothing happened, that I imagined everything. But Darren just kept getting weirder and weirder.  


  
Which means he really was sucked up by a spaceship.   


  
First thing after breakfast he went outside to the barn. I was washing dishes in the sink when I glanced up and saw him on the tractor, tilling up the front field. My mouth flopped open. I’d been planning to use that area for a “U-Pick” strawberry operation- I’d even ordered the plastic sheeting and supplies last week online.  


  
I abandoned the sink full of suds and dishes and marched outside.   


  
“WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” I yelled into the roar of the engine. I know he saw me but he didn’t stop. I finally turned, and went back inside. I had a bad feeling.  


  
All day long he worked the field. I watched him, cautiously, from inside the house. When I saw him finally head towards the barn in the afternoon, I thought he was done.  


  
I was wrong. He emerged, a bit later, with an ancient planter hitched to the back. I didn’t know the thing even worked- it had been left here by the previous owners.  


  
“What the hell,” I muttered, and I stormed back outside.   


  
“DARREN! WHAT’S GOING ON?” I screamed, as the tractor passed by. He did stop it this time, and I ran over as the tractor idled.  


  
“What are you doing? I thought this was where we would plant the strawberries!” I pleaded.  


  
His face was sheet white, and beads of sweat ran down his forehead. His expression was blank.  


  
“I’m planting corn,” He stated. He leaned closer. “We can ONLY plant corn.”   


  
A chill ran down my spine. The way he said it felt like a threat. He put the tractor in gear and moved on as I stepped back.  


  
“IT’S TOO LATE TO PLANT CORN THIS YEAR!” I yelled at his retreating backside. He didn’t acknowledge this, and I withdrew to the house to watch and wait.  


  
Darren stayed out in the field for the rest of the day. He didn’t take breaks, or come in to eat or drink. He had to be dehydrated- it was well over 90, and I knew he was hungry. It wasn’t normal.  


  
Darren didn’t turn the tractor off until nearly 9 o’clock.   


  
I prepared a meal for us. When he came in, I didn’t mention the strawberry field. In fact, I didn’t say much at all. Darren was scaring me, and I didn’t want to let on. He looked rough- almost feverish, and his eyes looked straight through me.  


  
We sat in our rocking chairs on the front porch as we ate dinner. It was dusk, and the lightning bugs were out.   


  
“I made you some brownies,” I said, passing him the plate. He took one without comment and bit a corner off.  


  
I watched him carefully over my glass of iced tea. He leaned his head back and closed his eyes. His rocking slowed to a stop.  


  
“Darren.” I said. He didn’t answer. “DARREN,” I said, louder. He didn’t stir.  


  
Good. It was working. I’d made some “special” brownies, just for Darren, laced with several of my crushed up ambien. I’d never drugged anyone before, so I prayed they were strong enough to keep him asleep for a while.  


  
I went inside and quietly turned the deadbolt on the front door. I dropped my plate in the sink, and slinked out the back to the barn.  


  
I had to get those tractor keys. Just to keep him from doing any more damage, or possibly hurting himself in exhaustion.  


  
They were dangling in the ignition, where I suspected they would be. I pocketed the keys, and turned to leave.   


  
That’s when I spotted the bags of corn seed.  


  
There was a big one full of regular seed, coated with red fungicide powder. That bag had been here since we moved in. But beside it was something else.  


  
My hand trembled as I opened the sack. The corn seed inside was glowing a faint, silvery blue.   


  
I dropped the burlap. “Shit.” The aliens had been real, they had really abducted Darren, and now he was growing glowing corn for them.  


  
I inspected the planter. He must have mixed the glowing corn with normal corn. Darren had contaminated the front field with glowing *(radioactive? my brain speculated)* corn seed.  


  
My heart pounded. All of a sudden, I just wanted to be safely in bed, and away from all this. I turned and headed back in the house. I locked the back door and breathed deeply.   


  
I knew, logically, the house was little protection against whatever I was up against. It was, however, excellent protection against Darren.  


  
I had a pang of regret. What had I done? *What you had to,* my brain answered. His behavior was off, he had worked himself to exhaustion, and he was ruining my farm plans with his delusions. Still, I felt guilty for leaving him on the porch all night.  


  
I crept to the front window and lifted a curtain.
