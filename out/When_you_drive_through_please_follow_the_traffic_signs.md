If you're following the highway, take the off ramp and take a sudden turn down an off road, you might just drive past the old water tower. Rusted out and clearly leaking from whatever rain water made its way in. There's no welcome sign into the small town of Edge Port, it's a nothing town that you can drive through in about 15 minutes just by following the main road. You won't find it on any maps, it's small enough to be roped into a few county's so it's not on any registry. Only the locals know that Edge Port is a place unto itself and that you have to pay attention in Edge Port.

I live in Edge Port. I don't really remember when I moved here, it feels like I've always been here but on a sunny day I can feel a memory itching at the back of my head. A cityscape in Autumn, I think it was New York? But I can never feel sure. I'm sitting on a park bench and I feel like I was just talking to someone but they're gone now. It's bittersweet and I really wish I could remember them but then the clouds roll in and I'm here in Edge Port.

It's not as bad as it might sound, everyday I wake up, I put myself together in the usual suit and tie. I commute to work, where I work a standard office job and hope that today won't be more data entry. (It always is.) I come home, take a shower and the rest of my day belongs to me. I think the worst part is always the commute, you have to be vigilant and if you see anything odd, you have to pay attention to it. 

I've had a few days over the weekend to collect myself but I can't sit back and pretend these out of towners don't bother me anymore. You see a sign, you listen to the sign, how is that so damn hard for people? I suppose that I should get on with things and issue my cautionary tale. If for some reason the guy in the black sedan is reading this, hello again. Please never drive through again.

The day started like any other, I woke up, got ready, poured a cup of coffee and got on my way to work. Hitting the main road I was quickly met with two things, one, a brand new road sign off 3 rd street that said “If you see it - Don't make eye contact.” In white reflective letters complete with a little silhouette of an eyeball. This is just how you know the rules that day, no one ever puts these signs up and it's not always an actual sign but there's always something like it around. So I slowed down and started to pay attention to anything out of the ordinary. 

That's when I was met with the second thing, a black sedan that refused to get off my bumper and made it well known he was unhappy that I was going 10 miles under the speed limit. It was clear he was from out of town and that he probably hadn't even seen the sign. I rolled my eyes and went about my business.

We rode like this for a good 10 to 15 minutes before I suddenly stopped, “Don't make eye contact.” Felt like an understatement when out of the corner of my eye I could see an eyeball floating through the fog, and getting ready to pass through the road. So I carefully busied myself pretending something had fallen down by my passenger seat, stealing half glances as the large eye stared down my car. 

Honk! Honk!

The man behind me must not have seen it, I saw the eye twitch white, it must have been looking back toward him.

Hoooooooooooooo-!

He leaned on the horn, the eye disappeared and all at once the honking stopped. 

I could have left. I should have left. People drive through here everyday, ignore warnings and only God knows what happens to them then. But he was right there and before I knew it I was on my way out the car door. In long, panicked strides I walked over to the car window and began beating on the window. When that didn't work, I started beating on the windshield.

“HEY! You got a fuckin’ problem buddy! You fuckin’ look at me when I'm talking!”

I couldn't come out and say it, not with that thing right over both of us but if I could keep his attention, just maybe things would be okay. And as the man rolled his window down, I tried so hard not to be relieved. I turned every inch of fear and panic into anger  and began my own road rage against the man.

“Didn't you see the sign asshole! It's 35 through here!” I shouted at the top of my lungs, I honestly didn't have much to be angry at but had to keep it going. Pretending that I didn't see it. I saw his eyes dart back to the eye and smacked my hand into the windshield once more. “HEY! You look at me when I'm talking!”

I like to think that at that moment we both came to an understanding that I was just as scared as he was, that I knew what I was doing, and that if he listened to me, it would all go away. I had no idea if things would be okay but maybe by following the letter of the warning we could get out of this. 

“It's bad enough I have to make my way to the same shitty job every fucking day without morons like you on the roads! Now I gotta deal with my boss being a fucking asshole over me being late!” And so I screamed at this random man. I started with traffic and moved into work as I could feel the humidity over my shoulder change, the man in front of me with tears welling up in his eyes and I knew. It was right there, it was waiting and it knew that I knew it.

“Don't start fucking crying now! You started this asshole!”

It had to be inches away from me just waiting for us to give up the act and look at it. So I kept going, this man became my personal therapist as I screamed about my life. My job slowly faded into my personal life and when I ran out of things to shout about there I'd just change the topic again, and again, and again. As time went by and people in the town understood, they would simply go around our cars and we would keep pretending that this was normal.

I was there for 3 hours before I could say it had left. I can tell you it was 3 hours because when I arrived at work, I was quickly called into the boss's office for being 3 hours late and when he finally looked at me, I was a disheveled husk of a man. My hair going in wild directions, suit creased and sweat stains all along my shirt. My face worn and tired as I had just been through a great ordeal, all he could ask was.

“What happened?” 

Worry creasing his brow, he wasn't looking for answers for my sake but his own. Hoping that maybe he could avoid this. I sat down in the only available chair and I wept. I could not answer his question but in that moment it truly hit me that it was over and in my relief all I could do was cry. I sat in that office, my boss half-heartedly comforting me, my throat rough and my cry barely a whisper until he told me that I was free to go home. 

The very next day, driving through on my way to work yet again, I saw the same sign post with a black trash bag over the sign and I know that when I drive through tomorrow the sign will be completely gone. It's the only way to truly know that whatever strangeness has passed.
