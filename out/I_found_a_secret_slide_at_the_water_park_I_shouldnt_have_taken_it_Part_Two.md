**PART TWO**

“C’mon! C’mon!” Hands seize my shoulders and pull me upright. “Let’s go!”

The girl in the bikini. Already moving, dashing away in front of me.

I lurch after her and grab her forearm a second before a blade the size of a tractor tire splits her in two. It whirs across the floor so close I feel it pass in a rush of wind. The man next to us isn’t so lucky. It cleaves him in half, foot to neck, along with two others who peel apart in shining slabs of intestine and muscle that slop to the rock.

*Holy fuck.*

A dark-haired woman scrambles between them, only to be incinerated by a wall of flame.

The crowd roars.

We run, weaving past more of the pistoning spikes, and evade yet another blade that eviscerates the guy with the dreads before a deep vibration brings us to a stop. I search for its source and count six...no, *seven* other competitors still standing, all of them looking around wildly, wondering where it’s coming from.

The grinding stops. We’re halfway to the slide.

A man in jean shorts bolts forward and makes it five feet before a granite column surges from the ground beneath his feet and launches him headfirst into the crowd. The creatures there scatter then creep back with extruded tongues and lips pulled wide in keening howls. His screams are the stuff of nightmares as they tear him apart.

I look back in time to see another granite column surge toward the cavern dome. And another, column after column sheering higher until they form a narrow canyon of polished stone. Beyond it, the slide shines like a lighthouse in the middle of a gale, the beam beckoning us forward. There’s no other way to reach it but through.

“Behold the Bloody Gorge!” the beast above bellows.

The creatures come to their feet with their clawed fists pumping—horrible, scaled appendages that flash in time with their guttural chant: “Gorge! Gorge! Gorge!”

I take the girl’s hand and yank her toward the crevice. She resists and pulls me back, her face bleach white. “No, hold on!” she says, nodding at the others. “There have to be more traps. Let them go first and show us where they are.”

It’s a good idea.

We don’t have to wait long. The woman in the purple swimsuit races for the gap, followed by a kid who’s about the twins’ age. After that, it’s chaos, everyone surging forward in a melee of elbows and knees as they pour into the canyon.

“Now!” the girl shouts.

We fly into the crevice. The woman is already too far in front of us, leaping from side to side, when a sharp click cleaves the air. A stone buttress rockets sideways from one wall and catches her mid-rib before pounding her into the far wall in a moist crunch.

The girl yelps.

“Don’t look!” I tell her, choking back a slug of bile as the click echoes again. Another colossal boom of stone rocks the walls, two more bodies turned into shapeless piles of grizzle sliding down the sheer granite face.

Five competitors left.

*Run.*

We sprint onward. A white-hot splinter of pain pierces my heel. It burns, blood seeping from the wound and turning the rock beneath me slick. But I don’t stop. *Don’t you dare stop, Garret.* Ahead, two men repeat the same side-to-side leaping motion as the woman before a blast of steam incinerates the one on the right.

I soon see why. The floor is honeycombed in front of us, with three-foot-wide alternating marble panels offsetting empty stretches of air. Black clouds of sulfur belch through the gaps, a river of lava flowing twenty feet beneath them, its surface bisected in glowing skeins of orange and red molten rock.

I look at the girl. “We have to jump!”

A hawk-faced woman bolts between us as I say it and leaps without hesitation, landing awkwardly on one of the panels before jumping to the next. The boy I spotted earlier, the one close to the twins’ age, pulls level with us and gazes down from the edge at the boiling magma with his mouth split wide in a rictus of fear.

“I can’t make it across that!”

His chin quivers, and for a moment, I see Alex standing next to me, alone and helpless, my little brother staring down into a flaming morass he can never hope to cross alone.

He takes a step back, and I open my mouth to call out to him, to tell him I’ll help him through this, that I’ll get him home, wherever his home is, when a flurry of steel-tipped bolts spit from the wall and send him rag-dolling forward through one of the gaps.

*No.* My muscles feel like they’ll slough off my bones.

The voice from above thunders down. “Make haste, competitors. Those who linger will be dealt with unfavorably.”

“Go!” the girl squeals, raking my arm with her fingernails. “Go! Go! Go!”

I jump and land on a marble panel, push off and leap for the next, praying my legs won’t fail me, that they’ll have the strength to propel me across. Hot steam whooshes past me, the smell of acrid heat filling my nostrils and coating my tongue. I leap again and again, the girl leaping with me until we’re both safe on the other side, breathing hard, the girl’s face streaked in ash.

We scramble on.

Ahead, the buttresses explode across the gorge, only there are no bodies this time. No fresh piles of human gruel shivering down the stone, save those already crushed. Instead, I see two figures working their way through the horizontal stone beams as they retract back into position—the woman who passed us a moment ago and a bald man wielding a pair of skeletal arms.

*They must have found a way to trigger the trap.*

“Hurry!” I tell the girl.

We race after them, past the beams, and sprint for the far edge of the crevasse. The man nears the edge of the chasm and unleashes a cry of delight, the woman running close behind.

Beyond them, twenty yards away, lies the slide.

I grab the girl’s hand and pump my newly restored legs as fast as they’ll go, begging them to go faster yet, the creature’s words ripping through my mind like branches of lightning. *Fifteen must now become one.* Only one of us can make it to the slide. Only one.

We barrel past sharp pillars of rock and leap over piles of scree, the girl gasping next to me, trying to keep up. My heel is so slick with blood I can barely maintain my balance.

The man shoulders past the woman and bursts from the gorge in a mad dash for the slide.

He’s close. *Too* close. We’ll never reach him before—

“Release the bestia!”

A broad travertine slab disintegrates beneath the man’s feet, and he tumbles into the resulting pit with a sharp cry. Something howls in response. It’s a roar unlike anything I’ve ever heard—the sound of a thousand shrieking voices melted into one.

The man’s cries turn wet and raw.

From the pit, a monstrosity appears. A nightmare with ivory horns jutting from a body layered in gleaming obsidian scales. It’s beyond colossal, looking like a black widow mated with a bulldozer as it emerges on six multi-jointed legs. Its faceted, jewel-like eyes shine as if lit with some terrible internal torch, and in its maw are the remains of the man: a sliver of scalp and a spray of shattered limbs that disappear with a final, meaty crunch.

*Dear God...*

A blanket of silence falls over the arena, only three of us left now. Me, the girl, and the hawk-faced woman.

There’s no sound. No motion.

I take the girl’s hand, and we press back against the canyon wall.

The thing rotates its head with a guttural growl. Snorts. Its demon-like eyes devour the coliseum. I don’t move. Don’t breathe. The girl is shaking so hard next to me that I’m afraid she’ll come apart. On the other side of the gorge, the woman crouches behind a shattered stone column, her eyes darting between us and the slide like a schizophrenic set of pinballs.

The beast snorts again and raises its head, firelight dancing over its horns and glossing its armor. It unleashes a haunting shriek, and a murmur of excitement ripples through the crowd. They can already taste the blood.

*Our blood.*

It eases closer, and a wave of panic sheets through my chest. I can smell the hot rot of its breath. Taste the death hanging in the air. I nudge the girl and nod at the slide. She shakes her head. Her face is paralyzed with fear, her eyes wide and wild. I squeeze her hand and will her to understand\*: If we run, maybe one of us makes it. If we stay here, we die.

And I don’t want to die. God, I don't want to die. 

The woman moves first, a shadow bolting across the floor.

She’s fast. 

The beast is faster. 

It rotates in one smooth motion and shortens the distance between them with horrifying speed. She leaps for the slide, and it snatches her mid-air. Gives her a shake. Her bones snap like gunshots. 

A voice blares inside my head: *Now!* 

I shove the girl forward, and we’re moving, racing toward the slide behind the creature as it whips the woman back and forth. It’s a sound like fabric tearing as she comes apart, a collection of moist weight splattering across a hard surface. 

My feet smack off the stone, my heart expanding further with each step. 

Ten feet to the slide.

Eight.

The beast still lapping entrails from the stone: *It doesn’t see us.* 

Six feet.

The crowd goes ballistic and wails for it to turn around, pointing at us in a forest of sharp, segmented figures. Screaming words I can’t understand.

Four feet. 

Two.

And then it sees us.

I hit the slide first. The girl lands beside me, and the water takes hold, both of us skimming forward. The slide rushing, pulling. 

*We made it! We both—*

The girl jerks to a stop. 

It’s all I can do to reach back and seize her leg before the tube swallows me. She’s shrieking, wailing for me to save her, to keep her safe. The beast has her by the arm, sending thick gouts of blood dripping off her elbow, turning the water around me to rust.

“Don’t let go!” I shout at her. “Look at me! Hold on!” 

She does, her face wracked with pain, her eyes burning in two pale beacons of panic. 

I tighten my grip, but her hand slips an inch. Water spills past my head and tears at my feet. Then, the creature snaps forward, and the rest of her arm disappears into a sea of shining teeth. 

“Champion!” a voice booms.

She cries out as her fingers slip from mine.

\#

I fly from the slide and flop into a swimming pool. There’s a scatter of motion, arcs of light wheeling my way as I swim to the ledge. A man in a Lagoon Island uniform waits to help me from the pool. 

“He’s over here!” 

More workers rush our way as the man heaves me up and onto the cement. I ignore them and glance back for the slide, which is gone. *Was it ever there*? A dull ache floods my chest.

“Garret...oh my God.” I turn around and spot Mom breaking through the crowd. “You’re standing.”

I look down at my legs and nod dumbly. 

*Yes. Yes, I am.*

With a sob, she crashes into me. The twins wrap themselves around my waist a moment later, both of them shouting my name. “Garret! Garret! Garret!”

Mom reaches up and cups my cheeks with both hands, her eyes wet and shining. “How did this happen, Garret? *How?*” 

I can’t answer, and even if I could, she wouldn’t believe me. Luckily, I don’t have to. The man in the uniform takes me by the shoulder and guides me toward my wheelchair, which is sitting right next to the snack shack where I left it. But unlike this morning, there’s no slide, only bare dirt and grass. 

He directs me to sit and then crouches down to assess my foot. Over his shoulder, the sky is nearing dusk, streaked in layers of peach and deep blood orange. 

He slaps a bandage on my heel and gives it a pat. “You’ll probably want to get that checked out, buddy. Looks like it might need some stitches.”

Mom assures him that, yes, of course, we’ll get it looked at. We’ll go to the hospital right away. 

I’m not listening to her. I’m thinking about the girl, about her seafoam eyes, and the way she pulled me off the ground and kept me going when she didn’t have to. The way the beast devoured her instead of me.

*It should have been me.*

It’s the thought that forces my hands to the wheelchair’s armrests. If I really can walk again, if I’m not imagining all of this, I won’t sit here...won’t leave this place hobbled and broken. Not when the price for my legs was her life. 

With a heavy heart, I force my quads to contract and my arms to straighten, the girl’s face still burning hot in my mind. And I stand.
