Quarter horse Devil part 2

 Looking away from the horrible fate of Lilly and Dart wasn't enough to stop what came next. The smell made its way into the round of my shocked senses and forced me to heave.

It was a horrible stench like the scattered corpses had been rotting for days. I slumped down on my hands and knees feeling dazed and motionless only a few feet away from Lilly and Dart. 

My hands fell on a semicircle of feathers and discarded beaks mixed in with the dirt and pebbles. Everything was placed so deliberately with some archaic function or disease. After somewhat regaining some faculty and completely emptying my already vacant stomach, I managed to stand and re-face the scene. 

JJ had completed his rotation around the corral, destroying all the gourds that had grown about, for a reason I did not know at the time. JJ found his way over to Mary, while keeping his eyes fixed on the middle of the carnage. 

He reached in his coat pocket and pulled out a flask, drawing an unhealthy swig from the container. After a short while he offered it to Mary, she refused his gesture so he put it away.

I dont understand who coulda done this to my dogs, crazy thing too JJ. I didn't hear a dam thing through the night, no commotion, no barking, no fighting. Hell my other dogs didn't notice anything either" Mary said this all with a shaky voice with her hand pressed to her chin. 

JJ knealed down saying " this is an evil at work here" he produced a small notepad and a pen, I'd seen him use it for his nature drawings. He started scribbling what I assumed were notes or maybe a rough sketch of the area. 

"This some kind of devil worship or some shit? Some punks sneak on to my ranch and kill my puppies for some kicks?" Mary said angrily

JJ walked around to the other side of the ring of viscera and put his hands along the ground. This dirt was disturbed by brush, tracks were covered here coming in from the desert" he said and motioned to the open desert that led to the mountains only a few miles away. They came from the desert, they went back into the desert. Ill find out who did this" JJ made his promise.

Carl, I called your mother, she's at the diner right now but she'll be headed back this way when she can get a ride from Robert. I want you to come inside with me and JJ alright?" Mary insisted I did so, I did not protest.

We headed inside Mary's house, her inside dog Cody greeted us, whimpering and tail wagging. Calm down boy" mary patted Cody and sat on her couch as he lay his head in her lap. He knew something was wrong, animals just know these things.

 Mary had an old TV in her upstairs guest room with a super Nintendo. That's where she had me set up until my mom had arrived. Before that could happen the police showed up knocking on the door. I stopped playing the games, I wanted to hear what they were going to discuss. I didn't get to.

 They walked outside to talk. I still got to watch what happened from the guest bedroom windows. 

 Two police cruisers were parked in the wide open front yard next to where the crime was. Another one parked directly in front of Mary's house. She was speaking with one officer, who had his hands on his hips, he was a chubby fellow with what looked like a cartoon villain mustache. 

He was fun to look at, the other officers were walking around, taking pictures, talking to JJ. They were doing cop things, it made me feel safe, like they solved the problem just by arriving. 

I could hear Mary getting a little loud through the window, I couldn't make out what she was saying but she was clearly upset. 

Mary's house phone started ringing, Mary must've heard it too because she walked in to answer it. Quarter horse ranch this Mary" she answered, she looked up at me, I was standing on top of the stairs at this point, looking down into the living area. OK, yeah no problem, its ok, bye" she hung up the phone. 

She sighed putting a hand on her forhead. Your mother can't make it tonight so you'll be staying over here with me" she smiled after saying. 

Big suprise there" I said, it was no secret to anyone at this point that my mom was a free spirit. She loved her children and wanted the best for them but had a strange way of showing it. 

You can use the guest bedroom tonight, if you want we can walk over to your trailer house there and get you some pj's" she said kindly. I thought about it for a second, " yeah, that'd be a good idea, besides I should write a note for my brother and sister in case they show up" 

I knew the chances of them showing up were slim but I didn't want them getting blindsided by some killer cult peoples if they did. Then again they might just think it's a prank coming from me. 

The events of the day wrapped up quickly from there. The police finished up their on site investigation, the most I got out of whatever was said was, teenagers this and devil worshippers that.

Afterward, JJ walked the property again. This time the entire area, he carried with him some kind of plant and a necklace. He was chanting something the entire time. I dont know what he was saying but it was comforting knowing he was doing what he thought would help. 

Later that day, when the wind started up and it was cooler, Mary and I walked to my families trailer house with one of her dogs Ally so i could leave that note for my brother and sister. The note didn't go into details, I just wrote down that I was at Marys house and they should come over too. 

The walk back to Mary's house from the trailer was short enough. I've walked it plenty of times but this time was much different. 

The horses were standing in the farthest corner of the corral facing the desert. Come to think of it they hadn't moved from that spot since that morning.
Almost like they were paralyzed or waiting for something. 

We walked slowly at first but picked up the pace a bit when the wind started getting bolder. Loose dust started filling the air, visibility was beginning to decline. 

I felt we were being watched. Ally had her head hung low and her eyes were darting everywhere. From the moment we left the trailer to head back to Marys, she seemed to get increasingly more tense.

There were gourds along vines, grown in various parts of the property that JJ had smashed but there was something sick about them. The flesh on the inside had turned red and veiny. They looked like eyes that had been stepped on. Mary gave me a worried glance, she'd noticed it too, I know she did.

Before we got to the house, Ally had stopped and faced towards the entryway of the ranch barking. Hanging, just beneath the wooden entrance that spelled out Quarter Horse Ranch, about thirty yards away. The limbless remains of another one of Mary's dogs twisted about in the wind. 

The horses had moved to face toward the new spectacle. Their eyes sunken but wide. 

Good lord" Mary said aloud. 
This was fresh, whoever these sick people were, they were quick and coordinated. 

We need to get inside, Carl, we're going to lock the doors and call the police" Mary said quickly and grabbed my hand pulling me along faster. Ally followed close by. Abandoning the sight of one of her slaughtered siblings. 

I hope JJ isnt out here still" I said, I last saw him headed over near Roberts property when we left to grab my things and leave a note. 

Shit" she said panicked, "you're right, I gotta find him, i gotta find my babies too, if they're still alive. We reached the door to her house and stepped inside. Ally came in too, Mary didn't want to lose any more of her dogs. 

She went upstairs and grabbed a shotgun " I dont know what good this is gonna do, I don't know who or what is out there but I want you to lock this door behind me and only open it if it's me or JJ do you understand? lock all the doors" She said with anxiety in her voice. Call the police Carl"!

I could see the adrenaline started to set in, each movement was frantic, shaky. Stay here Carl, Ally and Cody you stay here too"! " Shouldn't we wait for the police"? I pleaded with her.

" I dont got time to wait, Carl" That's the last thing she said before heading out into the dust. 

I dialed 911 but got nothing. In fact there was no electricity at all

The wind kicked up. Sand clattered against the window pains all around the house, the air whipping about a red stained mist that covered everything like dust covered cobwebs. 

I looked out the windows looking for any signs of Mary or JJ. The dogs whined and ran about the house agitated.

I would stop occasionally to pet them and try to calm both our nerves, they panted and shuffled nervously about. Their paws scratching about the wooden floors adding to the symphony of scraping that was playing in full motion around us. 

Every time I looked out the windows I expected to see someone. Nothing, for so long. The dust in the sky obscured so much, the only thing I could see clearly was the horses and the front entryway of the house. Everything else was shrouded and hidden by the red desert wind. I heard a loud bang. 

What could that of been? Maybe one of the troughs blew loose against the corral

I looked out back into the fencing, fully expecting to see an overturned metal trough. I didn't see one, i didnt see anything. The horses were gone.

 Just then I heard the front door handle start to jiggle. The dogs began to fuss louder. I started to panick, I forgot to lock the side entry door, I was scared, didn't know what to do. I told the dogs to come with me upstairs and I hid. I hid under some loose clothes in Mary's closet. I tried my best to hide the dogs with me too.

The door opened downstairs, I could make out the sand scattering around the wood floor like dice being thrown about. The door was quickly closed again. I pet the dogs and urged them to be quiet. There was something else inside the house now.
