Bob -

"Hey, Want to go to ridge?"

Loo -

"Sure"

&#x200B;

It was a fairly sunny morning, Me and my friend Bob had arranged to go Urban Exploring at a old building Assosiated with the Moor Mens Mental Hospital. The Building was a rotted Womens Building from 1916 which shut down in 2016, 16 years after the main Moor Hospital closed.

I Met my friend at the bus station at 10AM. We waited for the Number 10 bus, Ridge estate bus.

Me - "How you doing?"

Bob - "Good thank you."

We sat waiting for the 10 for about 30 mins. While we waited we discused our family, our friendgroup, Recent events and religion.

Eventually we decided the 10 bus was going to be late because the Television said 12:30 Return. So we walked.

The walk was a pain, it WAS painfull, My legs felt like they could snap at any moment. Eventually after 20 minutes we arrived at the front entrance as some other Urban explorers we ran into told us the back way was blocked by a private demolition company. 

"Demolition?" Bob said.

"They better not take down the ridge, its a monument of history considering how old it is." i replied

We had to be carefull entering through the front, the prison was right next door to the old hospital.

We used the bushes around the road to our advantage to not get spotted by the police surveillance covering the prison, we didnt want to be arrested and thought of as people scoping the prison for the breakout. We successfully got around the surveilance and we got past the stone that read "Welcome to Ridge Lea" We felt amazed that we were not caught.

We walked along the road and noticed the tyre marks from what appeared to be a van or car. We both shrugged it off as it was probably the demolition company. 

MAIN HOSPITAL RECEPTION, a sign read. And underneath it was a poster, it was torn and was several years old. It Read

R\_\_c\_\_\_\_ \_\_ea\_\_u\_  F\_\_m \_MP \_\_R\_S.

\*Insert Faded Picture of a man with silver teeth and a big scar on his neck.\*

Ha\_\_ \_\_u \_\_e\_ t\_\_s \_\_n? I\_ s\_ \_\_l\_ \_0\_

The Picture was faded but not faded enough to make out a man who looked like an agressive man in a blue T-shirt.

"Wow. Ridge Lea." I exclaimed.

We survey the outside of the building and see the wreck of the old bathrooms presumably done by a demolition company. Insulator, brick, Plasterboard, wood, screws, toilet bowls etc were in one big pile.

"This is what they realy did? Not much but they probably dont have the authority to bring ridge down." Bob said

"They refused to take it down a few years ago, So why did they do this?" I said

My question went unanswered, We go to the basketball court, and find our entrance.

A semi broken window, Like a crawl space.

I put my foot through the wood covering the window and make a 4ft tall hole in the wood we can climb through 

As bob climbed in i said "Ladies first."

"Fuck you loo!" We both Chuckle at my joke and we both climb in

We were at the bar, my grandpa told me a story about how he nearly got murdered by the patiants at Ridge in 1997 as he worked as a taxi driver, A woman wanted to go to ridge for a psychological checkup and she got him to wheel her into the bar, All the patiants looked at him and started chasing him. They smashed the car windows to nothingness until he sped off nearly hitting a discharged patiant.

We went deeper into the hospital avoiding the east side as it was practically ready to collapse. Through the building we went, Ground floor first, We found patients names and many old rooms, We went the the east side of the hospital really quickly and found a very spacious room, it had a bathroom, bedroom and a mini living space, The walls however had very vulgar drawings on them, we made a run for the main corridor as we didnt want to stay in the super decayed east side for too long.

The Basement,

We went into the basement to see what ws down there, it was just mostly old beds and heroin needles and cigs on the floor. Nothing special. We sat in one of the beds and started to pretend we were having mucsle spazzams making the most stupidest noises like "gogogogoggogo" or "ergegerrgegerergegr" with what we presumed was a old Electrotherapy machine. We went back upstairs after a while.

We went upstairs to the top floor, we booted doors open left right and centre with fear striking through us before we just realised there is nobody there, 

But when we opened another door, we saw clothing items.

Grey Jumper, Blue T-shirt, Grey jogging pants and White trainers.

We grabbed the clothing, presumeing they were hospital clothing, i started to put them on but the t-shirt had a blood streak across where your head would go, and on the arms.

I took the clothes off and i stept back, Bob followed suit.

"Should we call the-"

"Yes." Bob says.

I pull out my phone to take photos of the clothing and Bob pulls out his phone to ring 101

We hear movement.

**The hairs on our neck rises.**

We run out of the room, Shit scared. Footsteps follow us, And then we realise,

**We ran to the east side of the building**

We turn. And we see a man with a scar on his neck dressed in a High visability vest covered in blood. He has a belt on with a hammer in his belt and a stanley knife in his hand.

We were stood on a platform, there was no other place to run but towards this guy. The corridor around us collapsed ages ago and we are cornered.

The man smiles. and looks at us showing off his metalic teeth.

The roof falls onto us...
