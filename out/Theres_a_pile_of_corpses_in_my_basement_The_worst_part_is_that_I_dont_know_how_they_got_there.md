The faint scent of rotten meat made its way through my nose, and I winced. I began checking the fridge, making sure that there weren't any leftovers from the barbeque I had a few weeks ago. Nothing. I checked around the house for any rodents that might've gotten in and ended up dead—still nothing. Just when I ran out of every excuse and went to call the exterminator, I passed by the basement.

The smell had gotten stronger, like it was coming from downstairs. I let out a groan. The last thing I wanted was to go down. Using the flashlight on the back of my phone, I made my way down, the smell becoming nigh unbearable. I didn't even need to get down to the last floor to figure out where the smell came from.

For a moment, I shined my light over the space of the basement. The next, I vomited, coating the dusty concrete below me. I froze, hunched over, my hand barely able to continue holding the phone. I knew what I saw, but I begged and prayed that my mind was playing tricks on me. With another look, I confirmed what I already knew; a pile of corpses.

Forcing myself to continue looking, I realized that there was something much worse going on than just the corpses. There were at least 7 of them, but they were of varying degrees of decay and dismemberment. The man on top had remnants of life in him; his skin had just begun to turn gray, but a hint of colour remained. Meanwhile, under him was someone. I couldn't tell what they were or how old they were. Their body was deteriorating, green skin flaying off as patches of blood seeped out.

Worst of all, there were bite marks all across the body, pieces of flesh torn off completely. In fact, I couldn't find where their right arm was. Holding back the urge to puke once more, I immediately went to call 911 when something stopped me.

There was a piece of paper underneath me. As I flashed the light on it, I could make out words. It was almost illegible, with only a couple of letters here and there, but enough to make out. "Watch." It was only then that I finally noticed the camera propped up. I recognized it as the camera my mom gave to me when I entered my photography phase. Though, after I got a new one, I put it in a box where it collected dust. I guess this is where it ended up.

I swallowed back the fear I had and went to pick up the camera. My hands hovered above it, like touching it would cause a trap to spring on me. The moment I grabbed it, I sprinted up the stairs. For a moment, I thought the sound of me running up the steps didn't belong to me. As soon as I got out of the basement, I slammed the door behind me and put my weight against it.

I expected something hard to ram the door in time. But it never happened. I slid down, my breathing gradually becoming less erratic. I glanced down at the camera, spinning it in my hands. After using my new camera for so long, I forgot how these operated. I did eventually manage to get it open, and it automatically sent me to the gallery. Everything seemed fine; there were photos of me and my mom, as well as general landscape shots and... that's when I noticed it.

There was a video, and judging from the thumbnail, I was in it. but not when I was younger. It looked like me from just a couple of weeks ago. Curiosity got the best of me and I clicked on the play button.

The lighting was poor, barely able to capture the scene it was filming. There was enough, however, to see what was happening. The pile of corpses was there, but there were nowhere as many bodies as the one I stood beside. Just as I thought nothing could get worse, I walked into frame. But that wasn't me. I never went to the basement, let alone recorded a video. And I sure as hell don't remember seeing the corpses anytime before now.

"Hello!" The voice was damn near close to mine, but something about it was wrong. The annunciation was different, and the timbre of it wasn't quite right. But it was still unmistakably mine. The doppelganger continued, smile so genuine yet so counterfeit it made my stomach churn. "If you found this video, Alex, then that means you also found my food." It motioned towards the carcasses so nonchalantly I thought for a moment it didn't know they were dead. "I do hope you haven't called the police or anyone else, because you really want to hear this next part."

Its fingers pressed together, bending so far that the skin connecting its ligaments began tearing. Yet no blood came out. "Anyhow, as you can see, I look just like you. 'Why', you ask? Well, let's make a deal, shall we?"

Despite knowing that this was just a video and that whatever this was couldn't react to me, I nodded. "Keep my stash unknown to anyone and everyone, and won't ruin your life." My eyes widened, immediately knowing what it meant.

"Don't be such a worrywart, Alex. I won't hurt you. That would be counterintuitive. I need you alive. Rather, I would prefer it if you were alive. If you so much as told anyone about what's going on here, well... I wouldn't even need to touch you, no. News will spread like wildfire about how you are a cannibal, keeping corpses in your house! You'll beg the police that it wasn't you, that you're innocent, but everything will match. The fingerprints, the bite marks, everything. I even went through the trouble of targeting people that you hate. You know, for the motive."

It went out of frame, the sound of shuffling being heard off-screen. When it came back, it wasn't alone. The slack-jawed cadaver of Charlie leaned against the doppelganger, which had a hard time keeping him upright. I covered my mouth, and if I wasn't already on the ground, my legs would've ensured I was. It raised his limp hand, making it wave back and forth. "You hate Charlie, right? I mean, I would also be mad at someone who did it with my ex."

He let go of him, a loud thud following. "See? I'm on your side. All you have to do is deal with a little bit of smell, and I promise you, it'll be like nothing changed." The doppelgänger smiled a toothy grin. It must've been gritting its teeth extremely hard because, suddenly, a tooth fell off. It scoffed, rolling its eyes. "These things. Always falling off." Bending down, the doppelgänger returned, holding the loose tooth between two fingers. After forcing it into the free spot in its mouth, the monster continued the leer. "Bye now."

Then the video ended. I sat, staring at the blank screen for a few minutes before finally forcing myself to stand. Rage suddenly came, surprising even me. I gripped the camera and slammed it on the ground, sending pieces of plastic flying every which way. I paced back and forth, practically tearing the hair off my shoulders. Eyeing the telephone, my hand reached out for it before stopping.

I tried to make excuses to explain just what the hell I saw, but I knew it was useless. There was no explaining anything. That video was real, the corpses were real, and that thing that looked like me was real. I looked at the door to the basement before walking off. What else could I do?

Every time I awoke, the smell of blood permeated the air to the point where I thought my nostrils might burst. I could tell the bodies were increasing every day, judging by the intensity of the scent. Like an ocean of death, the tide of decay flowed throughout the house. Each time I passed by the basement, I would tell myself that I was going to do something about it, and each time I would walk right by, unable to muster the courage.

At last, I stand, the basement door ajar. The first time I opened it, a hideous fragrance of rot washed passed my face, taking my all not to pass out. This was it. The only chance I had at escape. I was out of options. Calling the police would have me labelled insane and a liar, running would prove my guilt and I would be known as a cannibal, and trying to attack the doppelgänger surely wouldn't end well for me.

At first, the only thing I could've done was abide by the monster's list of rules. Being sent to jail was terrible, yes, but that's not what stopped me from running. It was knowing that all of my friends and family would think of me as a serial killer. But if I was just another corpse in the pile, that would be a different story. Looking down at the pistol, I let out a regretful sigh. It contains only one bullet, and the target isn't the doppelgänger.
