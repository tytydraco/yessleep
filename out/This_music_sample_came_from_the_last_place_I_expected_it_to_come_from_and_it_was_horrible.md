I’m a music junkie. Not in the way that I just enjoy songs on the radio—I mean the kind of guy who digs deep, spending hours dissecting beats, breaking down samples, and hunting for obscure records like a detective chasing a cold case.  

It started with a song by one of my favorite underground rappers, **4b3rd33n**. The track was called *Hymns*. The production was *gorgeous*—somber violins looping in the background, a soft, eerie piano underneath, and this haunting vocal hum, barely audible, like a ghost whispering just out of reach.  

I needed to know where it came from.  

  
At first, I did what any sample hunter would do—I ran it through WhoSampled. Nothing. Shazam? Useless. No credits on the album notes.  

So I did it the old-school way. I combed through thousands of classical compositions, obscure soundtracks, even forgotten video game scores. Nothing matched. The sound was too raw, too intimate, like it was never meant to be heard by a mass audience.  

Then I started searching deep. Forums. Databases. Vinyl collector groups. Somewhere in the dark recesses of an abandoned music forum, I found a single post from 2011.  

**“Unreleased orchestral piece? Sounds like something from *The Forgotten Symphony.*”**  

No link, no follow-ups. Just that.  
  

That led me to **The Forgotten Symphony**, a supposed collection of lost compositions recovered from various sources—old tapes, home recordings, and decayed film reels. A few copies existed on private trackers, but nobody was seeding them.  

After weeks of searching, I found a guy on a borderline dead music forum who claimed to have a copy. He went by **Antiseekers_9383**, and his messages were… weird.  

> “You sure you wanna hear this?”  

I told him yes.  

> “It’s not just music, man. It’s history. A dark history. People don’t talk about this for a reason.”  

That only made me want it more.  


A week later, a package arrived at my door. No return address. Inside was an old VHS tape with **The Forgotten Symphony** scrawled in red marker.  

I had to borrow a VHS player from a thrift store just to watch it. When I pressed play, the screen was black for a long time—then, grainy film footage.  It looked 70s ish in quality, although I don't know for sure

A dimly lit room. A lone chair in the center.  

And then—music.  

I recognized it immediately. The violins. The piano. That ghostly hum. But hearing it in its raw, unfiltered form—it was *off.* In the song, it had a beauty to it, but here, it felt… wrong. Like it wasn’t composed to be listened to, but rather to accompany something… terrible.  

Then the footage jumped.  

Someone was being dragged into the frame.  

A woman.  

Her hands were bound, her mouth gagged, her eyes *wild* with terror.  

Her head was smashed into the ground, brain showing afterwards 

I stopped breathing.  

This wasn’t just old film.  

This was a snuff film.  


The music played as the figures in the video—masked, faceless—began their work. The violin swelled. The piano keys struck softly, deliberately.  

I *understood* now.  

The song wasn’t sampled from some obscure orchestral recording.  

It was taken from *this.*  

Someone, somewhere, had watched this tape, stripped the audio, and turned it into *art.*  

I stopped the tape. My hands were shaking.  

I wanted to believe this was fake. A hoax. But something deep in my gut told me it wasn’t.  

I tried to reach out to **4b3rd33n**—the rapper—but his social media had been wiped. His email bounced back. It was like he had disappeared.  

The last thing I found was an archived interview. When asked about *Hymns*, he said this:  

> “The producer found that sample from an old tape. Wouldn’t tell me where. Just said it had history.”  

I never listened to that song again.  

But sometimes—late at night, when it’s quiet—I *still* hear that violin loop in my head.  

And I wonder…  

Did I *find* the tape?  

Or did it find *me*?
