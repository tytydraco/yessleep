I'm currently writing this from my bedroom in the attic of the house I live in. 
I have two other roommates, one is my brother and the other is our childhood friend we met during Primary school.
We had another roommate at one point or another but he moved out and we haven't seen him since. 

Everything has felt a bit strange today, but I simply brushed it off as my anxiety; you see, I've always had bad anxiety and there are days where it becomes debilitating and turns into paranoia. 
And so, like any logical human being would do, I brushed my feelings aside as simply me being paranoid or anxious. 

Especially since it's been quiet today. 
Our roommate is out, and it's just been my older brother and I in the house all day today. 
My brother keeps to himself, unfortunately preferring to turn to the bottle for company unless we're both out and about in the common areas of our two story, three bedroom house.

I didn't know what was happening when suddenly my anxiety started to ramp up, but I certainly hadn't been expecting to look out the window and find some sort of giant creature staring back at me. 

I can only look away when I sit down. That's how I'm writing this. 
But it doesn't last for long; it's like my gaze is drawn back to it's giant, wide, blank eyes after only a few minutes of looking away. 

I don't know what it is, but I know it doesn't feel friendly.

It's bigger than two double-storied houses stacked on top of each other. It has to get on it's massive hands and knees to even peer through my small attic window. 
It almost looks like a shadow. A giant, grinning, malevolent shadow with eyes that stare into your soul. 

I'm scared to stand up and look at it again, but I can feel the compulsion to getting larger and harder to resist. 
There's this ringing in my ears that's almost deafening, and it gets louder the longer I don't look at it. 

I don't know what it will do to me, but I'm afraid it might kill me, or potentially do even worse. 
I'm too young to die, I haven't even fully gotten started on my life yet. 
I'm scared, but I know there's nothing I can do against some sort of giant, shadow, creature. 

I can feel tears pouring down my cheeks as I write this, but I hadn't even known I was crying. 
I guess terror will do that to a guy. 

I can hear my brother running across the house now, yelling out my name. 
If by any chance I don't make it out of this, I hope my brother finds this post so I can tell him how much I appreciate him always being there for me, even in his darkest times. 
I know I wasn't easy to deal with, especially after everything he had gone through in his early life. 

I can hear him pounding on my door, trying to get in. 
I'm going to stand up now, though; I don't know what will happen if I do, but I don't think it will be anything good. 

If you're my brother reading this, and that thing hasn't come after you through some miraculous intervention; I wanted to say thank you for being such an amazing older brother. 
I love you. 
Goodbye.
