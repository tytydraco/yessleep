I’d like to tell you about a baby I adopted several years ago.  I’d been unable to make a baby nor did we have quite enough money to adopt.  

My husband got an idea.  We would go to the abortion clinic and wait for someone that looked hesitant to enter, then invite them to stay with us the remainder of the pregnancy.  

It worked great.  We found a young woman from a troubled background.  She was a shy, quiet girl and we never did fully figure out why she was giving up the child.  But we didn’t press her; we didn’t want her to leave. 

In the days right after the birth, we filled out a lot of forms and paperwork.  I did notice that on some of the paperwork she’d written, “do not ever return.”  My husband and I were so thrilled with the baby that I don’t think we fully noticed it then.  

My husband and I were over the moon. We rocked the baby back and forth with tears in our eyes from joy.  It seemed to have colic a lot and cried nonstop.  One evening the baby had such a loud cry it shattered the bedroom window it was near.  This all  was alarming for us, but we decided with proper care the baby would be fine.

In hindsight, we should have checked more into the mother’s background. She disappeared on us as soon as we left the hospital.  We hadn’t anticipated that.  For all intents and purposes she seems to no longer exist.  Possibly registering a name change elsewhere?

I decided the best way to solve this was to enroll myself in every parenting classes I could find, joining everyone I found online and in our area.  It was a lot of work but I hoped it would be worth it.  I, also, started attending therapy to deal with the stress of this high-pitched wailing baby. 

My husband and I love this baby.  We loved watching it play, smile at us and were in awe of it otherwise.  So we forged forward. When it was a toddler , we had built the best jungle gym money could buy. 

It seemed the child (I don’t want to say their gender to protect their identity) was growing up and becoming able to control their temper better.  But then one day, it got mad at another child we’d invited over to play with them on their jungle gym.  Our child let out a high pitched wail.  I came running, hoping they hadn’t hurt the other child.  I noticed that as our child screamed, little tiny hairline cracks began to appear on the clear plastic windows of the jungle gym.

Still it was a literal dream to have such a beautiful, smart, quiet child so we persisted.  

One evening around twilight, and I want to say these incidents all seem to happen around twilight,  I was walking about the house when I heard the shrill screaming.  I went to check what was the matter and I found them sitting very upset amongst their Legos.  I watched as a fine line of film peeled right off the Legos they were holding in their hand.  

Two months later while visiting the doctor, our child got upset that the doctor wanted to look in their throat. At first shaking their head rapidly to say no and then very abruptly screaming “no” right in all our faces.  I watched as the glass jar that the doctor keeps her q-tips in first trembled on the counter and then shattered.   The doctor is now leery of us and you can guess why.  My husband, also; started to have fear of the child after this incident.

Each time I held them after that, I started to get concern they’d bust my ear drums. But when I hold them at bay, the poor thing gets this concerned look on their face and I don’t want them to think I will ever disown them. 

Recently  the child came to me looking scared and without thinking I put the child on my lap and they nuzzled into my chest as I said "what's wrong my child?" I pet their hair behind their ear, but suddenly their demeanor changed and they let out a glass-shattering scream against my chest.  I think my heart stopped.  I got a terrible ache across my ribs and suddenly my front tooth shattered.  The pain was immense and I couldn’t think.  I locked them in the bathroom, called my husband to come watch them and ran to find a dentist.  My nerves were dangling down and every time the air hit it I cried.  It took me over two hours driving 4 towns over in this condition to find an emergency dentist open in the evening.  

After this, my husband had a talk with me about whether a child like this should even be alive and what should we do about this…?

At the moment I’m very confused.  School will start in a few days and I’m not sure if this child is a detriment to the other kids at school or not?

I know this is very scary and that’s why I decided to post it here and not elsewhere. Thank you.

Do you think I should be concerned about sending them to kindergarten next week?
