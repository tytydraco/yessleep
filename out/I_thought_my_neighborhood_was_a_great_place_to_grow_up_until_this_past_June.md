I (16m) have lived in my house my whole life. I never really realized we were a wealthy neighborhood, just most of my friend’s houses had pools, and lots of kids got cars when they turned 16, stuff like that. The neighbors have block parties, we go to church together, very small town America stuff. No one ever did or said anything overtly racist, but pretty much everyone I grew up around was white. Still, they all seemed nice, it seemed like the perfect place to grow up, even for an awkward kid like me. Until this past June.

I had finished my exams, so it was summer break for me. My sister Emma (12f) was pissed that she still had two more weeks of school, and I woke up to her slamming the door. Kind of a brat thing to do, but I’d be mad too if I was her. I lazed around for a while after that, checking my phone, then grabbed breakfast. My parents were at work, but there was a note from my mom to look out for her delivery today. At about 10 a.m. I popped onto Facebook, I’d been checking Marketplace for new headphones. A post on my news feed caught my eye, from our neighborhood group. Lindsay Marshall, who’s daughter went to school with Emma, posted a blurry pic of a silver Audi, with the word WARNING underneath. She went on to say how the “brown guy” driving that car had been parked in front of the school. I guess she confronted him because he didn’t have any kids with him, and he said something vague and drove off. There were a ton of comments below urging her to go to the police. I rolled my eyes and closed the window. *People around here are so paranoid*. 

&#x200B;

I played video games until about lunch time, when I suddenly remembered I forgot to actually check for headphones, so I opened Facebook again. This time the first thing I saw was a post from the local sheriff’s department about the silver Audi. It looked like Lindsay called the cops after all. I clicked back to her original post and saw the thread had grown by hundreds of comments. It seemed like everyone in town was talking about this dude and his silver Audi. Then, people started posting about another brown guy in a white van driving around our neighborhood as well. Then someone posted about human trafficking. The grown ups all seemed really scared and concerned, I thought about calling my mom. 

&#x200B;

I heard a car door *slam* and looked out my window. My room looked out over our quiet cul-de-sac, and I saw a white van idling in my driveway. My heart started beating fast and my mouth went dry as I tried to remember if I’d locked the door after Emma left this morning. I was halfway down the stairs as I heard another engine roar up and screech to a stop. Voices started outside, they were angry but I couldn’t make out what they were saying. One of them sounded familiar. I peeked out my front window and saw our next door neighbor, Mr. Baird, he had parked right behind the van and was up in the driver’s face. The driver was young and dark. He also looked scared, I realized two other men that I knew from the neighborhood were with Mr. Baird. 

&#x200B;

I’d have been scared to, because Mr. B is *huge*. He owns his own construction company and looks like he could snap you in two just by thinking about it. I don’t know what the guy said to Mr. B, but he shoved the guy to the ground, hard. By the time I had run to my front door and opened it, they had the guy flipped over and his hands zip-tied behind him. All four men stopped and stared at me as I opened the front door. The man on the ground tried to yell something, but Mr. B shoved his face into the pavement. 

&#x200B;

“Dylan, it’s okay son, you’re safe.” Mr. B spoke calmly and looked me in the eye, like the man below him didn’t even exist. 

&#x200B;

I looked at the man on the ground and the white van behind him. “What’s happening sir?” I hated the quiver in my voice, but I couldn’t help it. 

&#x200B;

“These guys have been canvassing the neighborhood, son. First the school, now our streets. The police have been dealing with human trafficking in the city for some time, now it looks like they’re trying to come here.”

&#x200B;

“Mr. B? Are you sure? My mom was expecting a package today, maybe that’s just what-”

&#x200B;

“Dylan, trust me, we know what we’re doing son.” Mr. B’s voice was harder now, the way grown ups get when they don’t want you to ask any more. The man started screaming then. Saying how they were crazy old fucks and he was just doing his job. One of the men behind Mr. B came up with a roll of duct tape and put some over the man’s mouth. 

&#x200B;

Mr. B stood up, but kept his foot placed on the man’s back. 

&#x200B;

“Go on inside now son, we’ll handle it from here.”

&#x200B;

“Do.. Do you want me to call the police, sir?”

&#x200B;

Mr. B’s eye’s went hard at that. He motioned to the men behind him, and they picked up the man and put him in the back of the white van in the driveway. Mr. B walked up to me and I suddenly felt unsafe all over again as he put his huge hand on my shoulder and bent down to look me straight in the eye. 

&#x200B;

“Son, you’ll understand this when you’re a man and have a home and family to protect. The world is a hard place, and there’s only so much that the police are able to do. How would you feel if something bad happened to someone in this neighborhood? Hell, he was here, at your house. What if they snatched Emma? How would your Mom feel about that?”

&#x200B;

I started to speak but he tightened his meaty hand on my shoulder and I stopped.

&#x200B;

“Go on back inside now Dylan, and don’t go running your mouth off about this either.” 

&#x200B;

I turned and started to walk back to the house when he called back to me.

&#x200B;

“Oh and Dylan?”

&#x200B;

“Yes, sir?”

&#x200B;

“Remember son, I’m always right next door.”

&#x200B;

With that, he turned and went back to his truck. One of the other men got into the van and backed it out after he drove away. 

&#x200B;

Two days later the sheriff came to our house in the evening. He had questions about a delivery driver that had gone missing in the area. As I sat in our living room between my mom and dad, the sheriff asked if I had seen anything strange. I heard Mr. B’s lawn mower start up outside, and remembered that he and the sheriff were good friends. As I shook my head, my mom assured the sheriff that she hadn’t received her delivery that day. As the sheriff left I saw him walk over to Mr. B’s lawn. The two men laughed and chatted for a few minutes, surveying the lush uniform expanse of lawn in front of them. Mr. B was a fanatic about his lawn, stamping out any weed that dared sprout on his precious turf. He turned and our eyes met over his perfectly uniform blades of grass, and I got a sour feeling in my stomach. Not because he looked at me suspiciously, I think I could have handled that. Because he looked at me like we were *friends.*

&#x200B;

Since then I’ve just done what I do best, turtled up. People moved on from the disappearance of the driver to other things. The way that people are connected around here, it’s better not to make waves. My parents are always going on about what a great place this is to grow up. I guess it is, if you’re not weird like me. Emma seems to do just fine. Besides I didn’t *know* they hurt him or anything. Mr. B has a lot of money, maybe they just paid him to go away. 

&#x200B;

School started back up again, fall turned into winter. I like my classes, and I even have a spare first thing in the morning, so I get to sleep in. I try not to think about that day in June too much, when I do, the sour feeling in my stomach comes back. Mr. B offered me a job at his construction company next summer, and my parents think I should take it. I know the pay is great, but whenever I think about it, I think about his hand squeezing my shoulder, and the look in the eyes of the man on the ground. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, that isn’t why I started writing all of this out. I know things would have eventually felt fine again, they were already starting to, slowly. But then this morning, something weird happened. Everyone had left for school or work, and I was getting ready when I heard the doorbell ring. 

&#x200B;

When I got to the door, no one was there. I looked down and my stomach got that sour feeling again. Sitting on our front step was a box, it looked half charred and was soaking wet. It smelled gross, but I picked it up and brought it inside anyway. For some reason, I didn’t want anyone to see it. 

&#x200B;

My stomach has been in knots since, I can’t eat and my hands won’t stop shaking. I can just barely make out the label on the box, but I can see it’s addressed to my mom. I know, *I know*, this is the package that she was waiting for that day in June. Since I’m pretty sure the driver didn’t deliver it, who did? Why now? And why do I feel like it’s a threat?
