I used to think that families were bound by blood, by the shared history and those invisible threads of love and obligation that tie us together, no matter how frayed those threads become. But I’ve learned that some ties are not meant to endure; they unravel, slowly at first, then violently, until nothing is left but the raw, jagged edges of what once was.

My brother, Harrison, was always good at getting out of trouble. Even as a child, he had a way of wriggling free from the messes he made, leaving me to pick up the pieces. He was charming, with a smile that could melt away any scolding, and a quick wit that often left our parents more amused than angry. I, on the other hand, was the quieter one, the one who watched from the sidelines as Harrison danced through life, effortlessly avoiding the consequences of his actions.

But charm is always something of a double-edged sword. What others saw as charisma, I came to recognize as something darker: a subtle skill for manipulation, a knack for bending people to his will. As we grew older, that darkness became ever more apparent, creeping into every corner of our lives. Harrison wasn’t just avoiding trouble anymore; he was creating it, reveling in the chaos he caused.

Our parents were blind to it, or maybe they just didn’t want to see. But I couldn’t ignore it. I was the one who saw the shift in his eyes, the cold calculation behind his every word. And yet, for a long time, I held on to the hope that he was just lost, that the brother I knew was still in there somewhere, buried beneath the layers of deceit.

That hope died the day he walked away from us for good. It wasn’t a dramatic departure, no slamming doors, no final arguments. Just a quiet, deliberate severing of ties. One moment he was there, a looming presence in our lives, and the next, he was gone, leaving behind nothing but a hollow silence and the faintest scent of something burning.

I never told anyone what happened that night… the night our paths truly diverged. It’s a memory that clings to me like smoke, suffocating and inescapable. I can still see the flicker of flames in his eyes, the smile that didn’t quite reach them, and the sense that whatever was left of the brother I knew had been consumed by something far more sinister.

Now, years later, as I sit in the shadowy light of my living room, I can’t help but wonder if I ever really knew him at all. The news of his death should have brought closure, but instead, it has only opened up old wounds, wounds that I thought had long since scarred over. Harrison is gone, and yet, in some twisted way, he has found his way back into my life, bringing with him the same darkness that once shadowed our childhood.

As I sift through the remnants of his life — the ashes, the belongings, the journal — I feel the unease growing, a sense of foreboding that I can’t shake. Harrison may be dead, but the story of his life — and the nightmare he left behind — is far from over.

 

It was a Wednesday afternoon, one of those dreary, overcast days where time seems to drag, pulling everything around you into a sluggish haze. I was at my desk, half-heartedly sorting through my unpaid bills, when the phone rang. The number was unfamiliar, and for a moment, I considered letting it go to voicemail. But something compelled me to answer, a tiny prick of unease that I couldn’t quite ignore.

“Is this Hazel?” The voice on the other end was brisk, professional, but with an undertone of something I couldn’t place; pity, maybe, or dread.

“Yes,” I replied, my voice faltering slightly. “Who’s calling?”

“This is Detective Harding, from the Shasta County Sheriff’s Department. I’m sorry to inform you, but your brother, Harrison Wells… his body has been found.”

The words hit me like a physical blow, my breath catching in my throat. “Found?” I managed to choke out. “What do you mean? He’s been missing for years…”

“We understand this is difficult to hear,” the detective continued, his tone softening somewhat. “His remains were discovered in a remote area of the Lassen National Forest. It appears he was… mummified. The site where he was found was some kind of shrine, likely built by members of a group he was associated with: the ‘Veil of the Eternal Light.’”

The cult’s name stirred something deep within me, a memory I had buried alongside all my thoughts of Harrison. I’d heard it mentioned once before, years ago, when he had first begun to drift away from the family, while immersing himself in strange philosophies and even stranger company. But to hear it now, tied to his death, was like a nightmare dredged up from the darkest recesses of my mind.

I don’t remember much of what was said after that. The detective spoke in careful, measured tones, explaining how they had identified Harrison, how his body had been preserved by the cold, dry air of the mountains. He mentioned something about an ongoing investigation, the need to contact next of kin, but the details blurred together in my state of profound disbelief.

When I finally hung up, I was left staring at the phone, my hand was trembling. The room felt suddenly too small, the walls pressing in on me, as if Harrison’s ghost was lingering just beyond the edges of my vision. I had known, deep down, that he was gone long before this call, but hearing it confirmed by the authorities was something else entirely. The finality of it, the grotesque reality of his death, made it all too real.

Two days later, a package arrived at my door, the cardboard box bearing no return address. The deliveryman offered me a sympathetic glance as he handed it over, but I barely noticed. I knew, even before I opened it, what it would contain.

Inside, nestled in a bed of crumpled paper, was a small, unadorned urn: Harrison’s cremated remains. The sight of that alone was enough to turn my stomach, but it was the other item in the box that truly unnerved me. A leather-bound journal, worn and weathered, its pages thick and yellowed with age and use.

I stared at the journal for what felt like hours, my hands refusing to reach for it. It was Harrison’s, of that I was certain. The thought of reading it, of delving into the twisted labyrinth of his mind, filled me with a cold, creeping dread. But… I couldn’t ignore it either. It was as if the journal had a gravitational pull, drawing me in despite my better judgment.

Finally, with a deep, shuddering breath, I picked it up. The leather was cool against my skin, the edges frayed from years of handling. I could almost see him, sitting in some dark corner of that shrine, scribbling away his thoughts, his fears, his plans.

The first page was blank, as if he’d hesitated before beginning. Then, in his familiar, spidery handwriting, the words began to take shape, each one a thread in the web that would eventually ensnare us all. As I turned the pages, my heart pounding in my chest, I knew there was no turning back. Whatever secrets Harrison had taken to the grave, they were now mine to uncover. And in doing so, I feared I might uncover something far more terrifying than the brother I had lost.

 

I started reading Harrison’s journal that very night, although every instinct told me to stop, to put it away and forget it even existed. But curiosity, tinged with some sick sense of obligation, drove me forward. Each page felt as though it was peeling back layers of my brother’s mind, revealing a side of him I had only glimpsed before; darker, more twisted than I could have imagined.

The early entries were almost mundane, filled with reflections on life and musings about society’s many flaws. But even here, there was an undercurrent of disdain, a cynicism that seeped through his words. Harrison had always been quick to judge others, but the journal exposed a contempt for humanity itself. He wrote about people as if they were pawns, tools to be used and discarded. His words dripped with cold ambitions of manipulation, detailing how he would exploit weaknesses, how easy it was to bend others to his will.

As I continued reading, the tone of the journal shifted. His musings grew more erratic, more laced with paranoia. He wrote of a “light” that called to him, a force that promised power and immortality, but at a price he was increasingly unsure he wanted to pay. His followers, who had once revered him, became objects of his suspicion. He began to fear them, convinced they were plotting against him, that they were more loyal to the “light” than to him.

The journal painted a picture of Harrison’s mental descent: what began as confident manipulation spiraled into fear, a dread he could not escape. He wrote of visions, of shadows moving just beyond his sight, of whispers that grew louder each night. The “Veil of the Eternal Light,” the cult he had once commanded, had become his prison. They worshipped him, yet he feared they would one day destroy him to appease the light they so obsessively sought.

One entry, in particular, chilled me to the bone. He described the shrine where his body would later be found, a place deep in the wilderness, far from the prying eyes of the outside world. It was there that the cult regularly gathered, performing rituals under the pale moonlight, their chants echoing through the trees. Harrison wrote of their obsession with immortality, how they believed the light could grant them eternal life. But he feared they’d misunderstood something fundamental, that the light was not a benevolent force but something darker, something that fed on their devotion and would eventually consume them all.

With every revelation, I felt the walls closing in around me. The more I uncovered about the cult, the more I sensed that I was no longer alone. The journal had drawn me into Harrison’s world, and now it felt as if his fears had become my own. I began to notice things… small, almost imperceptible signs that someone was watching me. A car parked too long across the street, footsteps echoing in the hallway outside my apartment, the feeling of eyes on me as I walked through the city. It was as if the cult had marked me, as if by reading the journal, I had become part of their twisted story.

Then came the most terrifying realization of all.

I had just finished reading one of Harrison’s most desperate entries — a rambling account of how he no longer trusted anyone, not even those closest to him — when a name jumped out at me. He spoke of a man, a trusted confidant who had become his second-in-command, someone he had relied on before the paranoia set in. Harrison called him “Fox,” a name that sent a shiver down my spine.

I tried to dismiss it as a coincidence, but the memories came flooding back, memories of a time I had tried so hard to forget. A few months ago, during one of the lowest points in my life, I had met a man. He was mysterious, intense, with an almost magnetic pull. Our relationship had been brief but all-consuming, a whirlwind of emotions that had left me drained and hollow. When it ended, he vanished as quickly as he had appeared, leaving behind only a sense of unease that lingered long after he was gone.

As I read more about Fox, the feelings of dread in my chest grew. Harrison described him in detail; his sharp mind, his unwavering loyalty, his cold, calculating nature. The more I read, the more I recognized him. The man I had known, the father of my unborn child, was Fox. A high-ranking member of Harrison’s cult. A man deeply entrenched in the twisted beliefs that had consumed my brother.

This realization hit me like a punch to the gut. I was not just a victim of circumstance; I had been ensnared in their web long before I ever knew it. My connection to Harrison, to Fox, was not a mere accident: it was part of something far more sinister.

With that knowledge came a rising tide of fear. If Fox had been in my life once, who was to say he wasn’t still watching, still waiting? And what did that mean for the child I carried, the child who was now bound to this dark legacy?

The journal had taken me deeper into Harrison’s madness, but it had also shown me that I was now a part of it. There was no escaping the shadows that had haunted my brother, no way to erase the past that had led me here. And as the days passed, that sense of being watched grew stronger, the shadows more tangible, as if the cult was closing in on me, just as they had on Harrison.

I knew one thing for certain: I couldn’t run from this. Not anymore. The only way out was to confront the darkness head-on, to face the cult, Fox, and the legacy my brother had left behind. But even as I resolved to do so, the fear ate away at me, a constant reminder that I was in over my head, that the danger was far greater than I could ever have imagined.

 

The realization had hit me like a thunderclap: I had never been free of Harrison’s influence, not even after his death. Every page of his journal, every dark secret it revealed, had been leading me to this moment. The man I once thought of as a fleeting mistake, a brief escape from my troubles, was far more than that. Fox — Harrison’s confidant, his right-hand man — hadn't just been a part of my past; he had been woven into the very fabric of my life, a thread pulled tight by Harrison’s cold, calculating hand.

The truth was unbearable. My relationship with Fox wasn’t a coincidence, a random encounter during a dark period in my life. No, it had been carefully orchestrated, planned with chilling precision. Harrison had set it all in motion, drawing me into his twisted web even as I had tried to distance myself from him. And now, with Harrison gone, that web was closing in, tighter and more suffocating than ever.

In the days that followed, paranoia became my constant companion. I could no longer trust the world around me, couldn’t shake the feeling that unseen eyes were always watching. I started noticing more things I hadn’t before; the same car parked on the corner day after day, the way the shadows seemed to move just outside the reach of the streetlights, the figure I was sure I saw standing across the street, only to vanish when I looked again.

It wasn’t just outside that I felt the presence, either. My home, which had for so long been a sanctuary, now felt like a trap. I began finding subtle signs that someone had been inside—doors left ajar, a chair slightly out of place, the faint smell of cigarette smoke lingering in the air despite my never having smoked. At night, I heard whispers, soft and indistinct, like a distant conversation just beyond the walls. Sometimes, I would wake up with the feeling that someone had been standing over me, watching me sleep.

From that point I moved frequently, packing up my life and disappearing to another town, another city, trying to stay ahead of the creeping dread that followed me. But no matter where I went, the fear followed. It was in the flickering lights of motel rooms, the fleeting glimpses of figures in my rearview mirror, the calls that disconnected just as I answered. I was always looking over my shoulder, waiting for the next sign that the cult was close, that Fox was close.

The worst part was the constant uncertainty. I never knew if what I was experiencing was real or just the manifestation of my growing terror. The boundaries between reality and paranoia blurred, leaving me questioning everything; every sound, every shadow, every stranger’s glance. I could feel myself unraveling, slipping further into the fear that now dominated my life.

I wasn’t just running from the cult; I was running from the truth of what my life had become. I was a pawn in a game that had started long before I realized I was playing, a game that wasn’t over just because Harrison was dead. And no matter how fast I ran, how carefully I tried to hide, the feeling of being hunted grew stronger, as if the walls of that game were closing in on me, inch by terrifying inch.

The realization that I had been a target all along, that every decision I thought I had made for myself had been influenced by forces I couldn’t see, was suffocating. I was no longer sure where Harrison’s plans ended and where my life began. And the more I tried to escape, the more I understood that there was no way out—not for me, and not for the child I was carrying.

I knew I had to confront it. I had to face the darkness that had consumed Harrison and was now consuming me. But the closer I came to that realization, the more I felt the presence of something far more sinister than I had ever imagined. The cult, Fox, Harrison’s twisted legacy… they were all closing in, and I was running out of places to hide.

 

The small cabin I’d rented deep in the woods was supposed to be my final refuge, a place so isolated that even the shadows I feared couldn’t follow. But as I stood by the window, staring out at the dense trees that surrounded me, I saw him: Fox, a dark silhouette among the shadows. My heart raced, and I knew, in that moment, that there was no more running. The time had come to confront the man who had haunted my every step, the man who had twisted my life into a nightmare.

I stepped outside, the cold air biting at my skin, and approached him with a resolve I didn’t know I had. Fox stood perfectly still, his presence eerily calm against the backdrop of the swaying trees. As I drew closer, I could see the cold detachment in his eyes, the same calculating gaze that had once been so alluring yet now filled me with dread.

“What do you want from me?” I demanded, my voice shaking but defiant. “Why are you doing this? Why can’t you just leave me alone?”

Fox tilted his head slightly, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips. “This was never about you, Hazel. It was always about Harrison. You were simply… a part of the plan.”

His words cut deep, and I clenched my fists, trying to steady myself. “What plan? Harrison is dead, and I want nothing to do with any of this. Let me go!”

Fox’s expression darkened, his eyes narrowing as he took a step closer. “Harrison’s death was not a mistake. It was necessary. A sacrifice, for the greater purpose of the Veil. He understood what had to be done, even if he resisted in the end.”

I felt a chill run down my spine. “Sacrifice? What are you talking about?”

“He was chosen,” Fox replied, his voice low and ominous. “The light demands sacrifices, Hazel. Harrison knew this, and he knew that his bloodline would play a crucial role. His death was the beginning. But the real purpose lies with the child you carry. Harrison’s bloodline.”

My breath caught in my throat as his words sank in. “What do you mean? My child… our child… has nothing to do with this!”

Fox’s smile widened at this; a chilling sight that made my blood run cold. “Harrison ensured it. The child is part of the ritual, part of the Veil’s prophecy. You were always meant to bring the next vessel into this world, to continue what Harrison started.”

Panic surged through me, every instinct screaming at me to run, but I forced myself to stand my ground. “You’re lying! I won’t let you take my child; I won’t let you hurt us!”

Fox’s expression turned hard; his eyes were gleaming with something almost inhuman. “You don’t have a choice, Hazel. This was decided long before you even knew of the Veil. The child is ours.”

That was the breaking point. I lunged at Fox, driven by a primal need to protect the life inside me. My fist connected with his face, and for a brief moment, the surprise in his eyes gave me hope. But he recovered quickly, grabbing my arm with a grip that felt like iron. I struggled, kicking and twisting, trying to break free, but he was too strong, too determined.

The forest around us seemed to close in, the shadows deepening as I fought for my life. I could hear my own ragged breathing, the pounding of my heart in my ears, but I refused to give in. I clawed at Fox’s face, managing to tear away from his grasp just enough to stumble backward.

“Stop fighting,” Fox hissed, his voice dripping with menace as he advanced on me again. “You’re only making this harder on yourself.”

But I wouldn’t stop. I couldn’t. For the sake of my child, I summoned every ounce of strength I had left, kicking out and catching Fox hard in the knee. He grunted in pain, his hold on me slipping just enough for me to wrench myself free and start running. I dashed through the trees, branches slashing at my face, the ground uneven beneath my feet. Fox’s footsteps pounded behind me, his pursuit was ruthless and he was terrifyingly close. I could hear him, feel him closing in, but I forced myself to keep moving, driven by sheer desperation.

Ahead, I saw the faint outline of my cabin, the door still ajar from when I had rushed out to confront him. I pushed myself harder, my lungs were burning, my vision was blurring with tears of fear and exhaustion. Just a few more steps, just a little further, and I could make it inside, I could lock the door and… A hand grabbed my arm, yanking me back with brutal force. I screamed, twisting around to see Fox’s cold, emotionless eyes staring back at me.

“This is the end, Hazel,” he said, his voice like ice. “You can’t escape what’s meant to be.”

In that moment, something inside me snapped. A raw, animalistic survival instinct took over, and I lashed out with everything I had. My knee connected with his groin, and he doubled over in pain. I didn’t waste a second; I turned and bolted, stumbling into the cabin and slamming the door behind me.

I grabbed the nearest piece of furniture, a heavy chair, and jammed it under the door handle, my hands shaking uncontrollably. Fox’s pounding on the door echoed through the small space, but I didn’t wait to see if it would hold. I raced to the back of the cabin, throwing open the window and squeezing through, my body trembling with fear and adrenaline.

I ran, the forest swallowing me up as I fled into the darkness, Fox’s voice still ringing in my ears, promising that this wasn’t over. I didn’t know where I was going, or how I would survive, but I knew one thing: I had to protect my child. I had to keep running, keep fighting, no matter what it took. And as I disappeared into the night, I realized that this was only the beginning. The Veil of the Eternal Light wasn’t done with me, and I wasn’t done with them. The fight for survival had only just begun, and I would do whatever it took to keep my child safe from the darkness that had consumed Harrison and now sought to claim us both.

 

In the weeks that followed, my life became a series of fleeting moments, a blur of unfamiliar places and faces I dared not trust. I changed my name, my appearance, everything that could tie me to the person I once was. To be honest, every time I looked in the mirror, I barely recognized the woman staring back: my eyes were hollow with exhaustion, my hair cropped short and dyed a color that felt foreign, and my skin pale from lack of sunlight. But it was necessary. Survival demanded that I become someone else, someone untraceable.

I moved from town to town, never staying long enough to form connections, never letting my guard down. Every night, I triple-checked the locks on the doors and windows, setting up makeshift alarms with whatever I could find: a glass balanced on a doorknob, a pile of empty cans near the window. I slept with a knife under my pillow, though in truth I barely slept at all, my dreams were haunted by shadowy figures and the cold, piercing eyes of Fox.

The cult was still out there; I could feel it in the pit of my stomach, a constant gnawing dread that never let me rest. Every time I heard footsteps behind me on a dark street or noticed the same car in my rearview mirror for too long, my heart would race, and I would be on the move again. I never stayed in one place for more than a few days, constantly changing my routine, always watching, always waiting for the next sign that they had found me.

Through it all, I kept Harrison’s journal close, the one link to the brother I once knew, now twisted beyond recognition. I couldn’t bring myself to finish it at first, too terrified of what the final pages might reveal. But the longer I ran, the more the journal called to me, as if Harrison’s voice was echoing from beyond the grave, urging me to understand what he had become, what he had done.

One night, holed up in yet another anonymous motel, I finally gave in. I opened the journal to the last few pages, my hands trembling as I began to read. The entries had grown increasingly erratic, and were filled with cryptic warnings and frantic scrawls that barely resembled Harrison’s once-neat handwriting. He wrote of the light, of visions that had consumed his every waking moment, of voices that whispered in the darkness, promising eternal life, but at a cost he hadn’t foreseen.

He spoke of the cult members turning on him, their devotion to the light overshadowing their loyalty to their beloved leader. They believed his death was necessary, a sacrifice to complete the ritual that would ensure their immortality. But Harrison had realized too late that the light was not what it seemed, that it was something dark, something that fed on their fears and their blood. He wrote of the shrine where he knew he would die, a place he had once seen as sacred but had come to fear as a tomb.

And then, in the final entry, the tone shifted. The frantic, terrified ramblings gave way to a chilling calmness, as if Harrison had finally accepted his fate. He wrote directly to me, as if he knew I would one day read these words.

“Hazel, if you’re reading this, then it’s too late for both of us. The light will not rest until it has what it wants, and you are a part of this now, whether you choose to be or not. There is no escaping what I have set in motion. The child you carry… it is destined for something beyond your control, beyond mine. The Veil will find you, just as it found me. We are bound by blood, by fate, and there is no running from what is already written.”

The journal ended with a single, chilling line, written in a hand that seemed to shake with both fear and resignation:

“Your only hope is to embrace the darkness, or it will consume you.”

I closed the journal, my heart pounding in my chest. Harrison’s words echoed in my mind, a terrifying confirmation of what I had feared all along. There was no escaping this, no way to outrun the legacy he had left behind. The cult would find me eventually, no matter how far I ran, no matter how well I hid.

I was living on borrowed time, and I knew it. The fear that had driven me to survive now threatened to paralyze me. But I couldn’t let it. I had to keep moving, keep fighting, for the sake of my child. Yet, with every passing day, I felt the full weight of Harrison’s warning, a reminder that the darkness was always just one step behind, waiting for the moment when I would finally stumble, when I would finally fall.

As I packed up my few belongings and prepared to leave the motel, I glanced at the journal one last time, a cold resolve settling in my bones. Harrison was right about one thing: I couldn’t escape what was coming. But I would face it on my terms. I would protect my child, no matter the cost. And if the Veil of the Eternal Light came for us, they would find that I was no longer running.

I was ready to fight.

 

Three years had passed since the night I fled from Fox, three years of constant fear and vigilance. My son, Caleb, had become my entire world, the reason I pushed forward despite the shadows that still haunted our lives. I had changed our identities once again, settled in a small, quiet town far from the places where I once lived, trying to build a semblance of a normal life. But no matter how much distance I put between us and the past, I could never shake the feeling that we were still being watched, still being hunted.

At first, Caleb seemed like any other child: bright, curious, and full of life. But as he grew older, I started to notice things, small things that bothered me. He would talk to himself, or so I thought, but the way he would pause, as if listening to someone I couldn’t see, sent chills down my spine. Sometimes, he would wake in the middle of the night, standing in his crib, staring at the corner of the room with wide, unblinking eyes.

“Who are you talking to, Caleb?” I asked him one day, trying to keep the tremor out of my voice.

“The man,” he said simply, as if it were the most normal thing in the world.

“What man?” I pressed, my heart racing.

“The man who comes to visit me,” he replied, his little voice eerily calm. “He says he knows you, Mommy. He says you were friends with Uncle Harrison.”

I felt the blood drain from my face. I tried to dismiss it as a child’s imagination, but deep down, I knew it was something more. Caleb had never met Harrison, had never known him, and yet the way he spoke, it was as if he knew exactly who his uncle had been.

Then there were the drawings. At first, they were just scribbles, like any toddler’s art, but as the weeks went by, the shapes became more distinct, more deliberate. One day, I found a stack of his drawings hidden under his bed; pages filled with strange, intricate symbols, symbols that I recognized from Harrison’s journal and the cult’s rituals. My hands shook as I flipped through them, my mind reeling with a mixture of disbelief and terror.

It wasn’t long after that when I discovered the journal again. I’d hidden it away, buried it deep in a box in the back of the closet, hoping to forget about it. But there it was, lying on my nightstand, as if someone had placed it there deliberately. I knew I hadn’t taken it out, hadn’t even opened that box in months.

With trembling hands, I picked it up, flipping through the familiar pages until I reached the end. That’s when I saw it: a new entry, written in a hand that was not Harrison’s, but one I recognized all too well. The handwriting was neat, precise, and every stroke of the pen seemed to taunt me.

“Hazel,

Did you really think you could escape us? The boy is ours, just as Harrison intended. He carries the mark of the Veil, and through him, we will rise again. You cannot protect him from what is already inside him. The light will find its way, no matter how far you run.

—Fox”

I dropped the journal, a strangled cry escaping my lips. My mind raced, a thousand thoughts colliding as the horrifying realization set in. Caleb was marked, just as Harrison had been. The cult had never stopped watching, never stopped waiting for the moment when they could claim him.

I ran to Caleb’s room, heart pounding in my chest. He was sitting on the floor, quietly drawing. I snatched the paper from his hands, my breath catching in my throat as I saw the symbol he had drawn: a perfect, intricate replica of the one I had seen in Harrison’s journal, the symbol of the Veil of the Eternal Light.

“Where did you learn this, Caleb?” I asked, my voice shaking.

He looked up at me with innocent eyes, tilting his head. “The man showed me, Mommy. He says I’m special, just like Uncle Harrison.”

Tears welled in my eyes as I pulled him into my arms, clutching him tightly, as if I could somehow shield him from the darkness that had already taken hold. But I knew, deep down, that it was too late. Harrison’s legacy, the cult’s reach, had already wrapped its tendrils around my son. There was no escaping it now.

I carried Caleb to the living room, my mind numb with terror. As I sat on the couch, holding him close, I glanced out the window. The sun had dipped below the horizon, and the shadows outside had deepened, blending into the night. But there, in the distance, I saw them: dark figures standing at the edge of the trees, their forms barely discernible, yet unmistakably there.

They were watching us, waiting.

I tightened my grip on Caleb, my heart pounding in my chest as the realization sank in. I had fought so hard to protect him, to keep him safe, but it had all been in vain. The cult had found us, and they would never stop until they had what they wanted.

As I stared out into the darkness, my breath hitching with each panicked gasp, the last shred of hope I had held onto slipped away. The shadows were moving closer, inching toward the house with a slow, deliberate menace. There was nowhere left to run, nowhere left to hide.

And in that final, terrifying moment, I knew that the fight was over. The light had found us, just as Harrison had warned. The legacy of the Veil of the Eternal Light was not something I could escape, not something I could outrun. It was a part of us now—a part of Caleb.

With tears streaming down my face, I clutched my son tighter, whispering a desperate promise that I would protect him, that I would never let them take him. But even as I said the words, I knew they were hollow. The darkness had already won, and as the shadowy figures outside loomed ever closer, all I could do was wait for the inevitable.

The last thing I saw, as the figures finally reached the window, was Caleb’s innocent smile, his small hand reaching up to touch the glass, as if greeting an old friend. And then, the world went dark.
