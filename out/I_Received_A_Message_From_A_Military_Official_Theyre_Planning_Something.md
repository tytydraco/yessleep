My name is \[REDACTED\]. I'm a former Intelligence Analyst, and I worked for a top secret organization within the Military. I'm not going into too much details on my background or everything else, since I want to make this quick, otherwise you can expect this message to be much longer than it is.

I'm going to say this to you with a straight-face:

YES. There does exist "life after death" such as you know it, just not in the way you were led to believe. There's no Heaven or Hell as the Christian perspective described it. They were concepts put in our minds by those we once saw as "Gods" since the ancient times. In actuality, wherever you go in death, depends whether or not you're attached to this world, or that you 'create' the moment of your existence, meaning what you create with your thoughts, becomes reality.

Why am I telling you this? This is because there exists a veil between the physical plane and, the astral plane. From what we know, the astral plane consists of things that have passed on in life, such as the spirits of deceased loved ones, angels, demons, and other beings considered cryptid or mythological by nature. Meanwhile, here we are in this physical plane: Eating, drinking, fucking, and so on.

Enough about this. I'm going to get started with what I discovered, and I must share this before I get caught. There's no doubt "they" are monitoring my computer as I'm about to share this to each of you what's about to happen in the near future. I'm not going to worry too much. I have a pistol with me. I may be long gone before this message is received.

It all started with one simple discovery. It was the year '2018' and I was stationed at a military base in \[REDACTED\], South Dakota, near an area where no base should exist. It was an underground facility. I was led in a room full of computers, and other personnel who monitored screens that display areas all over the globe. Nothing out of the ordinary happened, and I was expected to accompany the rest of the team. I sat in an empty cubicle, and began my work monitoring the screens.

It was a simple task of course. Monitor the screens, look for any unusual activity, particularly ones of which involve terrorist attacks in the U.S, or hacking attempts done by anonymous individuals who are well experienced in that field. My job lasted for 4 years, and I been well known as among the best analysts. I was even rewarded, and given honorary congratulations for catching some of the most sophisticated hackers.

What I didn't expect, was something that led me to where I am now. I was heading to what I'd like to call the break room, looking to get some food to eat, and a cup of coffee to keep me up for my shift. As I made my way to the break room, I could hear one of our higher ranked officials, more specifically, Commander \[REDACTED\], speaking to somebody who's voice I didn't recognize. This was what I heard:

Unknown: How long until the veil falls?

Commander: That depends on the current project's ability. We had a few tests, but we still weren't successful. My best estimate is a couple more years, maybe more or less.

Unknown: Does anyone in the public know about this?

Commander: No. Soon as the public starts getting suspicious, it's decided that a major war must take place to keep the public distracted, and so far, it's working.

Unknown: The Russia-Ukraine War?

Commander: Affirmative.

Unknown: (Laughs) It seems Putin is accepting this, and will be doing his job well. He knows he'll be hated by many throughout the world, but it's worth it if it means keeping humanity in the dark, and he'll be rewarded for his actions, keeping the world public's attention fixated on him, should all else fail.

Commander: I just hope he doesn't go too far with it and set off a nuclear war.

Unknown: I doubt he's that stupid. But even if he does, either way, that veil must be broken.

Commander: If the veil does fall....?

Unknown: Our Lord will be pleased. He will rise again to reclaim the Earth. Humanity will regain what was lost.

Even though this was not the entire communication, these were the most important parts. It turns out that the wars, especially the one we're seeing right now, is a ploy to keep us in the dark from what's planned to occur, and unfortunately, it works. Yes, the Russia-Ukraine war was planned out years before it happened, and Putin is in on it.

As for the veil, I had no idea what that was, or what they meant by it. I looked to see where they were exactly, and I could see a door with a sign that said:

LEVEL 4 & ABOVE PERSONNEL ONLY.

Honestly, I never been in that room since I was a LEVEL 2 personnel. Given the sign, I obeyed it. I didn't have any idea of what was going in there until now.

Then suddenly, the door opened, and I saw Commander \[REDACTED\] come out of the room, along with a man wearing black hooded robes. He looked like he came from Anton Lavey's occult system, or even the Vatican. I had no idea, but I could feel the 'menacing' vibe he gave off. Then, I noticed they were both looking at me.

"You like what you see, \[REDACTED\]?" Commander \[REDACTED\] asked me.

"No." I explained.

"Then stop staring and get back to your business." Commander \[REDACTED\] said to me, before he and the hooded figure walked away. I was shocked, to see Commander \[REDACTED\] with the hooded man. That was the last thing I expected out of him. This Commander screamed at one of the personnel who was wearing uniform that wasn't required in this facility. The same Commander who beat a personnel half to death because the poor bastard was caught 'jerking off' in one of the bathrooms. So to see him not giving a threatening reaction to the hooded man, makes me think the figure may be very important, and if anything happened to him, then Commander \[REDACTED\] might receive a harsh punishment. Nevertheless, I couldn't stop thinking about their discussion.

While I waited for them to leave, I went into the breakroom to grab what I needed. As I came out of the breakroom, I noticed they were all gone, and I could no longer hear their footsteps. With that, I was able to go into that room, to see if there was anything in it. Even though I'm considered LEVEL 2 personnel, I went against the sign and went in. This is where things took a strange turn.

The room had nine small screens at the far side, with a few computers. This was when I decided to look around. I came upon the screens, they looked like screens I'm familiar with in my work area. However, something was different. The computer had a display setting for the screens which made no sense to me. This particular setting said 'ASTRAL' on it. This was something I never saw on the computers I work with, let alone my years of being here, so that was new.

"Is this a prototype display setting for the monitors?" I thought to myself. I noticed that the screen was set on 'REGULAR' display.

That was when I foolishly decided to click on 'ASTRAL' display. When I did, I saw some things I wish I didn't.

The screens came out, different. I'm familiar with devices that have thermal vision, night vision, as well as infrared vision. This one, had a type of vision I've never seen before. In one screen, I could see something with wings, flying across a mountain. I also came with a horrifying realization: This was live, so it was happening as I observed it. This winged creature was moving from left to right over the mountain. On the bottom left of the screen, it showed the location. This was taken at Mt. Fuji in Japan. I clicked on the creature, and my screen zoomed in on it. It looked like it came from Hell. Given the distance from the camera, I think the entity was about twelve feet tall.

On another screen, I could see my old hometown where I grew up. The screen seemed to be facing a park and some tall buildings. In my observations, I noticed a figure standing in one place at the park. I clicked on the figure, and it appeared to be a woman. I immediately recognized her as one of my former neighbors. She was murdered by a group of burglars at the park ten years ago, so to see her standing there without moving, horrified me. When I zoomed in on her, I was able to get a good look at her face. I saw her eyes were black as a void, and her mouth had blood coming out of it. I could also see bloody stab wounds all over her body. I then realized I was looking at her ghost. It's clear she isn't resting in peace, or she has unfinished business.

Then, I looked at another screen. This was the most bizarre to me. I saw entities, coming out of a very strange craft of some kind. It looked like your typical 'UFO' you would see in the skies, except I'm fully aware that all those UFOs you see in the skies are actually government and military craft, being tested for future use. However, seeing this one, I was confused. The entities coming out of it, looked like small gray beings. I also recall looking at the screen on 'ASTRAL' display. I had this idea of switching back to 'REGULAR' display. But when I did, and looked back at the screen, the beings were gone, and so was the craft along with everything else I saw on previous screens, especially my neighbor's ghost. They re-appeared when I switched back on 'ASTRAL' display.

On the fourth screen, which was pointed at the sky, there was a large figure that appeared to be flying in the distance. I decided to zoom in, and I was surprised with what I'm seeing. This figure looked like a white horse with wings, flying through the clouds. Pegasus? A unicorn? What was it? Seeing the fifth screen also pointing at the sky, there appeared to be two massive planets near Earth, but they're invisible to the naked eye. All the other screens showed things I couldn't wrap my mind around.

"You like what you see, \[REDACTED\]?"

I jumped in fright, hearing that question. I wasn't expecting anyone behind me. When I turned to look, my eyes went wide. It was the hooded man, and I could see his face more clearly. This man had eyes that appeared 'soulless' and he was smiling at me with a grin. His face was pale. I noticed Commander \[REDACTED\] standing next to him. He had his 'M4' in his hands, and the last thing I recalled at that moment was when he lifted his rifle up, and swung it at me.

I woke up in the same room, tied to a chair. Commander \[REDACTED\] and the hooded figure was still with me.

"Good. He's awake." I heard the hooded man say. He then introduced himself to me. "Hello there, Mr. \[REDACTED\]. My name is \[REDACTED\], and I'm a high-ranked priest of \[REDACTED\]. It seems you've been peeking into the astral plane." he said. "The astral plane?" I asked. "Yes, dear soul. The Astral Plane." he said.

"Did it ever occur to you there's a reason Level 4 personnel and above only are allowed to see it?" Commander \[REDACTED\] asked me.

I suppose he was right. After looking at those screens, I could never view the world the same way now, even to the point I fear that the day I die, I'll become an attached spirit like my old neighbor. I suppose there was a reason I wasn't cleared to see it. Still, I needed answers.

"How long have you guys known about this?" I asked.

"Over seventy years, let's say." Commander \[REDACTED\] replied.

"Seventy years!?" I asked out of shock.

"Remember President Eisenhower?" Commander \[REDACTED\] asked me, and I nodded. "He is the first to make contact with "extraterrestrial" beings as we call them, who inhabit the astral plane. It wouldn't make sense to you of course, but they have the ability to condense and harness energy to attain physicality for a short period of time. So not every 'UFO' belongs to us." he said.

"You see that planet right there?" he then asked, pointing towards the screen of the two planets. "The "extraterrestrials" come from that planet, yet we can't see them, at least not physically. Then we have these." he spoke, adjusting the screens to show different areas around the world. One of the screens now showed an area that the Native Americans called "Skinwalker" territory. Seeing the screen, there were indeed those mythological beings. One of the beings came very close to the camera, and I got a good look at its face. It was so sudden, I jumped in fear. It looked, terrifying.

I then looked at another screen, showing a floating city above the clouds. Interestingly, the city in the screen looked much different than the reported sightings of a "floating city" above China, or 'Fata Morgana' as they called it. But this one was crystal clear, and there appeared to be entities with wings flying around it. Nevertheless, I had enough, and decided to ask questions.

"Why?" I asked. "Why take interest in the Astral Plane? Is the military interested in battling astral creatures now?"

"It's much more than that, Mr. \[REDACTED\]. Our Lord Lucifer will be able to interact on this world, and reclaim Earth under his possession." Priest \[REDACTED\] said.

"LUCIFER!?" I asked, shocked at that name. "What about God!? Or Jesus!?" I asked, but he laughed as if I had just told a very funny joke.

"You poor soul. God never truly existed, and Jesus was a human being who lived at the time when the world was unveiled, which was why he could do "miraculous" things as we heard. Lucifer was, and still is, the True God of this world." the priest continued.

"No, that cannot be. I don't want that devil taking over this world, and..." I tried to speak, but the Commander cut me off.

"Which was why you never had the clearance to see this, \[REDACTED\]. You don't understand what you're told. You've been lied to, all your life. It's clear you can't comprehend that there is no God. Every other "deity" you heard about, were humans with abilities at the time of an unveiled world. They became "gods" and "goddesses" to those who didn't understand or realize they can do the same."

As I tried to process what he said, the word 'unveiled' came to mind, which made me recall what they previously discussed.

"What would happen, if the world becomes unveiled again?" I asked. That's when the priest spoke up.

"To answer your question dear soul, humanity will regain what was lost, and Lucifer will rise to be the ruler, once again."

"But how did we lose our abilities that made us "gods" and "goddesses" in the first place? What event made us lose sight of this?" I asked myself, but Commander \[REDACTED\] spoke as if he read my mind.

"In time, the ones who were aware and became "gods" and "goddesses" died out, while those who were ignorant, unaware, and worship the "deities" grew in numbers. This is something the ancient people of Scandinavia referred to as Ragnarök, An event which humanity lost its true nature and potential. We've been developing machines capable of assisting us in breaking or at least thinning the veil. I assume you were aware of our experiment we called 'Project Blue Beam', correct?"

"Yes. I'm aware of it. It was some kind of holographic projection system of some kind." I said.

"Close to that. But unfortunately, the whistleblowers ruined that for us. So our next project, was CERN. Of course, even this project had whistleblower attention, but they couldn't get a full picture of the project, and the information they got their hands on, was deliberately fake. Oh yes, we took necessary precautions." Commander \[REDACTED\] said.

"But why keep this a secret for so long? Why not share about the existence in the astral plane with the world?" I asked. "Let's answer that question with another one." Commander \[REDACTED\] said, before he continued.

"Are you afraid of clowns?" he asked me. Of course, I used to be afraid of clowns. Despite having the 'fun and joy' style, their appearances did freak me out a little. I'm not scared of them anymore, but it doesn't mean other people aren't scared of them either, perhaps even when they're older.

"Not anymore, sir." I said, and he chuckled at that. "Good, because I will say this." he said, before continuing.

"If some people can't handle seeing clowns, let alone being afraid of them, what makes you think the same people could handle comprehending the existence of things in the Astral Plane?" he told me. It didn't make much sense after that, because they're also planning to break the 'veil' that separates the astral and physical plane. "Then why bother to break the veil?" I asked, trying to make sense of this.

"You asked why we kept this a secret for so long, yes? I gave you a specific answer to that. Most people in the world wouldn't have been able to comprehend it in the past, perhaps even today. But, we came across some remarkable discoveries." he continued, then pointing at the screens.

When I looked at them, the screens shifted, showing faces of certain people. It wasn't just any random person, not at all. The people I'm seeing are well-known throughout the years. I recognized several of them.

*Robert Monroe*

*Lawrence Spencer*

*Simon Parkes*

*Stanislav Grof*

*Terrence McKenna*

Surprisingly, *Mark Twain*

Even more surprising, *David Icke*. This is the man who was credited and also ridiculed for his discussion on Reptilian entities. There are also a few faces that I didn't recognize. One looked like a man who is in his late teens, or early 20s. Another one appeared to be from an occult organization, matter the 'runes' as they're called that appear on his robes.

"These are interesting people. Even though their information isn't entirely accurate, they have several fundamental ideas of the existence, just in their own perspectives. Nevertheless, they're quite close to understanding the truth of the existence." Commander \[REDACTED\] replied.

"But why show them to me? Why is that important?" I asked. He then gave me an interesting reply.

"Because this means people are slowly becoming conscious and aware of the existence. We predict in 2024, most of the world will understand and accept the so-called "possibility" of existence in the Astral Plane, as well as higher planes of existence. When the veil is broken, the two planes will merge again. The fact that humanity is now seeing there exists life elsewhere beyond this physical plane, is a perfect catalyst for us. Of course, people started becoming aware much earlier than that, but we did not have the proper technology or means to break the veil, until now."

I was shocked at this, and just when I was about to ask about the Russia-Ukraine war, trying to make sense of that, the priest cut me off, and I figured he could read what I was thinking.

"Dear soul, the Russia-Ukraine war is meant to keep people distracted from knowing of our plans, not the existence of the astral plane."

I said nothing else after that.

"So what's going to happen to me now?" I then asked.

"Normally we would have you thrown into a military prison, or killed for knowing too much, since you had no clearance for this. But since you're a very valuable Intelligence Analyst, and well known for your efforts in catching even the most difficult hackers, I want to give you a second chance. I'm not going to speak to anyone about this, so you'll be granted amnesty, provided you keep your mouth shut. Do you accept this?" Commander \[REDACTED\] asked me. I was surprised to be given this choice, so I accepted it.

Since then, I kept my mouth shut. It's been four years now, and 2024 is nearing. I fear that this will be the year that the veil breaks, and when it does, humanity will be dealing with things they still won't be able to handle, let alone understand. Even to this day, I still can't comprehend the images I saw on the screens. I would much rather live my life in ignorance. Ignorance is bliss, as they say. I-

They're knocking on my door. They know I'm about to post this. I wish I could say more, but I'm out of time. I can only pray that it doesn't happen in 2024, or happen at all. But if it does happen, please, be careful out there.

Goodbye.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That was it. There is more to the message, but it's very long, longer than what you've just read. That's why I decided to compile and post the important pieces of information from the message. Even when some of the information doesn't seem that important, it actually gives you a rudimentary idea of what happened, and what's about to occur soon.

Since the information was from a military personnel, I decided to redact specific names and places, so that the identities of the people involved are protected for good reason. I also won't risk any attention from the government, or maybe even the FBI, the CIA, or even the Pentagon. I also decided to redact my own, to avoid scrutiny.

Before I continue, I want to introduce myself. My name is \[REDACTED\], and I'm formerly one of those whistleblowers who specialized in hacking and programming. Though, I wasn't the type to cause a bit of mischief for our government, since I was more interested in hacking computers belonging to those who keep child \[REDACTED\] and other illegal data on their drives, and exposing them.

When I first got the message, I literally thought someone was pulling a prank or something. It was so hard to believe. Who'd have thought that top secret organizations would have an interest in causing a worldwide catastrophe, by merging the Astral plane with the Physical plane, therefore destroying the veil? Also, a fucking unicorn? Seriously? If this was a joke, they sucked at it.

The other thing 'off' about this was the fact this supposed official claimed he was allowed to continue working provided he kept his mouth shut. To be honest, I think in an actual military situation, those of no clearance would've been given amnestic treatments, if not killed. It seems, they didn't do their job well, because this person is now spitting out information after all these years.

Nothing about this message made any sense to me. It looked as if someone just wasted their time by posting shit like this on reddit, perhaps for the fun of it. I would've passed this off as a simple prank. Hell, the entire message seemed 'rushed' too, a little too rushed if you ask me.

I was about to delete the message, but something in me kept stopping me. It was as if, there was something about this message that was very important, and I felt myself suggest that it's best to do the research and find out for myself.

That was when I looked up some of the names I didn't redact, one of the most interesting being that of Robert Monroe. This was the guy who spoke heavily on "Astral Projection." He even wrote books on that stuff, one of his most famous being: Journeys Out of the Body. I purchased that book, and when I read it, I was interested. Normally, I would've passed it off as some 'new age bullshit' or anything that would mean I discredit it wholeheartedly. However, I decided to hold my doubts away, and look up on Astral Projection. Of course, you'll find various amounts of information on the internet regarding said phenomenon. Back then, this wasn't the case.

I decided to look up information on Astral Projection, and what that entails. Along with that, I noticed there were also instructions on how to perform Astral Projection. This is where I decided to try out one of these methods. I won't name the method I did that worked, since I wouldn't want you doing it, and trust me, you don't want to, after everything I saw.

Once I used the method that worked, I suddenly found myself suddenly 'floating' up, and as soon as I turned to look down, I noticed my body was laying there on the bed. This terrified me. I didn't think it would actually work, but it did, and it proved to me that Astral Projection does exist, and it does work.

Still, I was shocked and trying to comprehend what just happened. I recall seeing people mention that they could move anywhere in the astral where their thoughts and intentions take them. That's when I decided to 'think' myself at my ex-girlfriend's place. When I did, I regret seeing what I saw, since it involved the time I broke up with her. I found out she was to put it this way, "having fun" with a pool boy I fought after he had too much to drink. Even though I won, I suppose good looks still enticed her to sleep with the guy.

However, when I went to her place, she didn't look normal. In fact, I could see she was changing, and not in a good way. Then, I found out why.

She found out that pool boy left with another chick, and I could feel she wanted to commit suicide just to end her pain. Even though we broke up, I wanted to help her out, to get her life on track.

"Kathy?" I yelled. She looked in my direction, before she started looking around. I realized she couldn't see me looking at her because I was astral projecting, but when I called to her which prompted her to look around for me, she started sobbing. Then, she started speaking.

"\[REDACTED\], is that you?"

Then she started crying heavily, before speaking again.

"I'm so sorry, \[REDACTED\]. Please, forgive me. I didn't mean to break your heart. I'm sorry."

I could sense the seriousness in her. She truly felt terrible for what she did to me. As of now, she and I are back together, and trying to work this out. She made a vow never to fool around on me ever again, even though I still have my suspicions.

But before any of that happened, I could do nothing but watch her cry. Nevertheless, I couldn't stay to try and comfort her in some way, since I needed to focus on finding out the answers. I have to admit, I found this experience to be quite interesting, even though it was a little difficult to comprehend. In all my years, I never thought I could see myself astral projecting, and being able to move around by just merely 'thinking' where I want to go. I also discovered I could fly around too.

Unfortunately, my experience went from interesting to horrifying. I came upon my favorite park. Only this time, I could see someone standing there. Other than a few nighttime joggers and people simply walking their pets, there was a strange woman standing in a particular spot. I never saw her before. I began to wonder if she was contemplating something. I noticed a few joggers run by her. It seems as if they didn't acknowledge her presence. When I got closer to her, I could hear crying sounds, coming from her direction. A jogger suddenly ran towards me, and before I could react, I thought I was going to bump into him. But he went right through me, and I immediately recalled I wasn't in my body.

Still, the thought of that made me focus on him, and I foolishly asked myself why he couldn't see me, even though the answer was obvious. I then heard another jogger coming close by. That's when I took out my hand, to see if I could block him, or to see if he could see me. But like the first one, he just went through it. While I was feeling a little freaked out about this, I understood that this plane isn't physical like the reality we live in. I then watched a woman jogging with her two dogs. They were pit-bulls.

I decided to stick my hand out again, trying another silly attempt at this. However, this experience was different. Soon as she got close enough, one of the pit-bulls jumped up and tried to bite my arm. That experience alone caused me to walk backwards, feeling shocked at what just happened. I noticed that the two pit-bulls were looking directly at me, growling and barking at me. The woman however, didn't notice I was standing there, and she tried to calm her two dogs down. Eventually, they obeyed her, as they turned their attention away to continue their business.

One of the joggers saw the ordeal and asked her.

"Ma'am, what happened? Is something wrong?"

"I don't know. One of them jumped in front of me and started barking and growling for no reason, but there was no one there." she replied.

I understood that she was shocked, and wanted to continue her business. From what I could sense in her mind, this was the first time her two pit-bulls acted aggressively out of nowhere, because they are actually very friendly as she raised them to be. To see them act that way, frightened her. I suppose I'm to blame for their aggressive behavior. They probably thought I was trouble to their owner.

I was about to leave the park to continue my journey, when something was off. It didn't take long for me to realize there were crying sounds right behind me. It felt as if someone was also standing right behind me. I immediately received confirmation, when a cold, bloody hand grabbed my shoulder.

Once I saw the hand, I screamed and turned to see who it was. It was the strange woman. This time, I got a good look at her appearance. She had stab marks all over her body, and they had blood coming out of them. Her eyes were completely black, and tears of black liquid came out of them. Her mouth was a slight, gaping void, and I could hear her emitting crying sounds. I was shocked and horrified of the ordeal. I turned to see the joggers, but none of them were looking at us.

I turned to look back at her, and I felt terror shot through me at break-neck speed. She was a few feet away from me. Now, she's inches away. I also noticed the crying sounds stopped.

"Help me." she said, in a whimpering tone. Her mouth started spewing out blood.

"What?" I asked, since I didn't understand her at first.

"HELP ME!" she screamed loudly, her mouth becoming wide open, screaming in agony. I was horrified to the point that I didn't think of anything else other than to get away from her. But when I thought to head back home, I suddenly found myself back at my place. I went into the dining room, and I saw my girlfriend sitting on the table and enjoying a coffee while reading a book, which confirmed I was back. I'll never forget that horrifying experience though. Thinking back on it, I felt bad for her. I want to help her out, but I'm still too terrified of the ordeal, and I don't want to go back there.

Then, I recalled what I learned about the particle collider, particularly, CERN. That was when I decided to 'think' myself to the collider, to see if I can get a good look and find out what's going on. I instantly appeared at a particle collider, only, not quite. This one seemed 'different' from the one that conspiracy theorists and whistleblowers discussed. This one certainly wasn't designed in Switzerland. That's when I decided to 'poke' around.

I observed the particle collider for some time. This thing looked nothing like what they claimed it would look like. Even stranger was I can feel a strange, dreadful 'presence' creeping around in this facility. After a few moments, I noticed a few people wearing what I could only describe as military uniforms, and there were two people following behind them. The first one looked like a military officer of higher rank, while the other was wearing robes.

I immediately recalled what I got from the message about Commander \[REDACTED\] and the priest.

Could this be them? If so, they seem more frightening in person than I expected, especially the one in the robes. he looks like someone who just came out of a coffin. My eyes went wide, when the hooded man spoke.

"It's a shame your friend \[REDACTED\] took his own life."

That's when the man I found out to be Commander \[REDACTED\] replied to him.

"He was meant to arrive with us to this facility. My superiors wanted him dead, but I insisted he go with me to this place, to help him see the truth. His presence here can also be monitored 24/7 as I suggested. Sadly, they got their first wish. The problem was, I don't know how they found out he's become aware."

"I suppose your superiors have a way of tracking everyone, even without realizing it. But still, that man would've made an excellent asset for gaining intel on the astral plane." the hooded man said.

I was shocked when he said that.

Did that mean they weren't going to kill him? Does that also mean they never found out he shared his message with me? To see these two here, of all places too, brought chills down my spine. Was the man who sent the message to me, telling the truth? Even though the message didn't make an ounce of sense to me?

Then, the hooded man said something that caught my attention.

"2024 is near, over a year away. We've waited patiently for this moment. There's no guarantee that the project will be successful on that year, but I can feel that the veil is slowly thinning, and more people are waking up. Lucifer will rise." he said, smiling.

The one problem that came to mind was this:

How would a particle collider have any capability of breaking the veil? Does the collider have the ability to do just that? I could only think of two possibilities:

1. CERN isn't just a particle collider, as there's more to it than that.
2. The term 'particle collider' is not its true purpose.

Perhaps the term 'veil breaker' would be more appropriate if the second possibility was true. Still, the thought of the astral and physical becoming 'one' is a horrifying aspect. Because if that happens, then you can expect to see that terrifying woman from the park, as if she was still alive. Perhaps you could even see ghosts or demons with the naked eye, just roaming about. To add to my fear, they can 'touch' you if this happens.

Sadly, even I don't have a means to stop this. No one does. If we're lucky, the project is a 'dud' and the chances of the veil being thinned away is delayed.

But if they succeed, I fear that most of humanity won't be able to handle seeing spirits or other things labeled "superstitious." Hell, some people would go crazy and face existential dread, or worse if what was said about humans becoming "gods" and "goddesses" was true. Humans are a 'fucked up' species after all, so the thought of us being 'deities' is a terrifying thing. Throughout history, humans have a history of tyranny. Imagine one of those tyrants being a powerful 'god' or 'goddess.' It wouldn't be pleasant, and even if people are becoming aware as they claimed, it still wouldn't mean the rest of the populace is.

I'm sending this to you, as a warning for what might come in the future. When 2024 arrives, I can only hope that the 'merging' of the two planes doesn't occur.

If it doesn't occur, then it means they failed to merge the realms, and we can wipe the nervous sweat from our faces.

But if they're successful, then I'll give you the same warning:

Please, be careful out there.
