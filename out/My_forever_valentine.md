For years I hated Valentine’s Day. As a kid I didn’t mind it. Being an only child my mom would spoil me whenever “holidays” rolled around. Valentine’s Day was no different. She would get me stuffed animals, my favorite candy, and whatever new toy I wanted. As I got older the magic had worn off for me. I never had a “valentine” outside of my mom so that day was always bittersweet for me. Yes it was sweet to get things from my mom but just like any teenager I didn’t value my mother going out of her way to always make sure I felt loved. It didn’t help that my father was always saying how ridiculous Valentine’s Day was.

  


“The greeting card companies take advantage of all the fools who are willing to spend their hard earned money. I love your mother every day, why do I need a specific day to show her. They hike up the prices of candy and flowers. It’s a suckers day!”

  


My mother never really seemed to mind my Father’s rant about it. She was just happy to give me my gifts and celebrate the day with me. 

  


It wasn’t until I met my wife that I truly had a “Valentine”. I always made a big deal out of the day when it came to her. I suppose it was my mother that helped me to realize how to celebrate someone you love. I had just never experienced that until I finally met the love of my life. 

  


While I loved celebrating the love I have for my wife and showing her just how much she means to me on that special day, she wasn’t the biggest fan of it. Not the celebrating the love part, that wasn’t the issue. It was the trauma from when she was a child. Her father had left her mother on Valentine’s Day when she was a kid. In some dramatic fashion he left a note telling her he couldn’t fake the love anymore and that Valentine’s Day shouldn’t be a pretend day in which “we show love” to each other. He had packed up over night and started a new life in a different state. As you can imagine this effected my wife throughout her life. Part of the reason I’m extravagant on that day is to not only rid the memory of her father leaving but to her assure her that she won’t have to worry about me doing anything like that to her.

  


Even though I was married I never neglected my mother on Valentine’s Day. Especially in the recent years since my dad passed away. I always made sure to get her a dozen roses and even some chocolates. My mom always loved receiving them and would always call me after the delivery “surprised” that I would do something so sweet. 

  


“Oh thank you honey! I was shocked to get a delivery on Valentine’s Day. Who knew my little boy could be so sweet!”

  


I could tell it meant a lot to her and it was something she looked forward to. On that same “surprised” phone call she would always say the same thing in regards to my wife.

  


“How could someone not like Valentine’s Day! With someone as sweet as you by their side it wouldn’t hurt her to show some appreciation.”

  


I would always tell her the same thing.

  


“Ma it’s always a lot for her to deal with. Her father really messed her up when she was a little girl so this time of year is always rough for her. She appreciates everything I do for her and my goal is to just help her to forget that horrible memory just for the day.”

  


This year for Valentine’s Day I had something even bigger planned. Flowers, card, candy, dinner, that was always part of the deal. But this year I was going to recreate our proposal/wedding. I rented out a big hall for all our family and friends to attend. I wanted to create a new core memory for her on this day. I wanted her to forget about what happened all those years ago. Secretly I had been planning this for months. Making sneaky phone calls. Contacting family and friends to be apart of it. Coming home late from work to go see a florist or stopping by the venue to make sure everything was in order. It was all going according to plan until about a week before Valentine’s Day. I got home late again and my wife was waiting by the door.

  


“Where have you been? Do you think I don’t know what’s going on?”

  


“Huh? What are you talking about honey?”

  


“Late from work again? Phone calls and secret texts to whoever it is you’re talking too?!”

  


“Oh baby, you have this all wrong-“

  


“Save it, I’m not dumb. I won’t have another man walk out of my life. I packed a bag and I’m going to stay with my mom.”

  


I didn’t want to ruin the surprise but I also wanted her to know I wasn’t doing anything wrong. 

  


“Wait, wait! I’ll tell you what’s been going on.”

  


“No you won’t, I’m not listening I need some space. I am leaving.”

  


“Honey, I swear this is all a misunderstanding…”

  


She wouldn’t listen. She slammed the car door before I could even spit out the truth. She had been at her mother’s house for a few hours before she finally picked up my phone calls.

  


“I’m coming to your mom’s now. I am going to tell you what has been happening.”

  


I arrived at her mother’s house and I spilled the beans. I explained to her exactly what I had been doing. She looked dejected. I can sense the guilt she felt. Instantly she started to cry and apologize.

  


“I’m sorry it’s just-“

  


“I know honey.”

  


“Can I ask you something?” She said through crying eyes.

  


“Yes, of course anything.”

  


“Is it possible for you to cancel this? This day is just to hard for me. I can only imagine the effort you put in but I don’t think this is a day I can ever be happy about. I just don’t want to celebrate anymore.”

  


What could I do? Tell her no, that we have to go through with it no matter how miserable the day makes you feel. I could still get my money back and no body was traveling from far away so I’m sure if I told them in time it wouldn’t be a big deal.

  


“I will cancel it baby, I will be here for you. Whatever you need. We won’t celebrate it anymore. I love you.”

  


  


Valentine’s Day was here. My wife and I had been on great terms since that terrible misunderstanding and as she wished we weren’t celebrating. We had dinner like we normally would. We laughed, we played some games, and we watched our show. It was nice to see her relaxed and feel no pressure about the day. These last few days my focus was on her and making sure to keep her head clear. Because that’s what you do when you love someone. You are there for them and support them in their time of need. We had went to bed that night without even mentioning “Valentine” and we were happy and that’s all that mattered to me.

  


It was the middle of the night when my phone rang. The caller I.d read “mom”.

  


“Hello?” I said with a tired voice. 

  


“So that’s it? No flowers, no candy? Do I mean nothing to you?”

  


I had completely forgotten to set up my annual delivery of flowers and candy with everything that been going on at home.

  


“What? Oh, shit Ma I’m so sorry. We have been going through a lot here. I literally just completely forgot.”

  


“Oh did you just “forget”. After all the years I raised you. After everything I’ve done. I have no one in my life. And now you, you just forget about me? It’s all about your unappreciative wife now huh?!”

  


“Mom, relax. I forgot. I will make sure you get a delivery tomorrow.”

  


“Fuck you and that fucking bitch of a wife!”

  


She hung up. I sat there in shock. My wife had woken up and asked who I was on the phone with. I told her it was my mother and that I had forgotten to send her flowers and candy like I do every year. She was surprised that she called in the middle of the night be reassured me that everything was going to be fine. 

  


“This is my fault, you were doing this for me. I’ll make sure your mom gets some flowers and candy tomorrow.”

  


I couldn’t sleep for the rest of the night. I was shocked and pissed that my mother would speak to me that way. The way she spoke about my wife it was like she was holding in hatred for her. I needed to talk to her today. I was going to call her when I got home from work.

  


Imagine my surprise when I saw my mother’s car in front of my house when I got home from work. I hesitantly walked inside. 

  


“Hello?”

  


“Hi honey, your mom is here she dropped by with some apology cookies, you gotta try them they are delicious.” My wife said with a smile and laugh as she walked to the kitchen to get the cookies.

  


“Hi son, I truly am so sorry for calling you in the middle of the night and speaking to you the way I did. You didn’t deserve that.”

  


“Mom you don’t know how much I needed to hear that. I am so sorry I forgot. Things have been so crazy here.”

  


“I can only imagine.”

  


That’s when I heard a commotion in the kitchen. I ran to see what it was. My wife was on the floor, the tray of cookies all around her. I ran over to her. She was foaming at the mouth.

  


“What the fuck! Baby what the fuck happened?!” I dove to the floor trying to help her. Did she need CPR? Was she choking? The gurgling sounds would not stop coming from her.

  


“MOM CALL A FUCKING AMBULANCE!! …MOM RIGHT FUCKING NOW CALL AN AMBULANCE I DON’T KNOW WHATS WRONG!”

  


“MOM!!!!”

  


That’s when I felt a hand on my shoulder. My mother knelt down next to me and whispered in my ear.

  


“I am your forever Valentine.”
