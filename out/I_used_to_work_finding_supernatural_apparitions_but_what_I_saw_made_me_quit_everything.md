For over 50 years I have worked investigating the supernatural; my whole family worked in this field. However, due to a lack of concrete evidence, many people disbelieved them, even so, they taught me everything they knew, and it has been passed down through generations, but none of my descendants have shown any interest, and that worries me.

 But something changed during my childhood; I was born in 1965, and I witnessed the growth and evolution of photos and videos, on camera, it was possible to obtain evidence, but only from those in poor condition, imperfect cameras that show imperfections in reality, People, often disbelieving but desperate, brought me photos to analyze; those with something supernatural were to be burned. 

I have countless stories and have learned a great deal about all kinds of apparition, various types of demons, obsessive spirits, shadows, false gods, events that cant happen, doppelgangers, ghosts, and they all saw It and came to me, i edited the photos to make whatever was there more visible. 

When it was a demon, the photo was always accompanied by something; the person would report things breaking without explanation, insects appearing in their house, and blood dripping from the keyholes in the doors, In these cases, it even happened that sometimes people close to those who sought my help made pacts and promised the soul of the person who spoke to me; in these cases, the person would go through several "near-death experiences", The photo was proof; it was a disfigured, somewhat animalistic, dark red face that appeared when edited, But of course, this is just the most common demon; there are various types of demons, including Succubus/Incubus, Oni, Yokai and such, honestly, it's been a while since I told these stories, so I wanted to tell several. If you're interested in any of them, don't hesitate to ask. 

Obsessive spirits also had effects on the person; they felt followed and always reported that They could feel winds even with the house closed, touches with no one around, and it was pure paranoia; when she showed me the photo, it was exactly as predicted, A dark creature with intense eyes stared at its victim, almost waiting to do something, learning, watching. 

The Shadows were always the ones that intrigued me the most, and even scared me, because of the unknown; it was impossible to predict what they were or what they wanted, Nothing changed in the person's life, and sometimes the photo was from a long time ago precisely because nothing changed; they were just humanoid figures, either completely white or black.

These are popular; you yourselves have probably seen something like saints' faces on nonsensical things, and many even find it cool, but beware, the creature behind it wants to deceive you, to mislead you away from your faith to faith it instead, you wont even noticed when you start praying for It. 

When old photos show extra limbs on bodies, hands, arms, or something completely impossible like something floating, that's always the most obvious thing to spot, the people with it tens to belive more in my words. 

To explain doppelgangers, I'll tell a story, but without revealing names, of course. Anyway, a mother had taken a picture of her young adult daughter, but in the photo, the daughter's kitten was seen lying on her feet, But at that moment the father was at the vet with the cat; after the photo was burned, the family continued with their lives as normal (the cat is having a happy life now, dont worry)

A story also helps to tell about the ghosts; a father had arrived with a family photo, where only he, his wife, and his 17-year-old son should have been pictured, but next to his son there was another boy, looked like 7 years old, His skull was bleeding, he was crying blood, his skin was bluish. That's when his father told me the story: the older son had pushed his brother into a lake; he had been bullying him for a while, but, this- time the boy died drowned, It was necessary to burn the photo so the boy could die in peace

Having explained the basic concepts, I should add that there are situations where a single creature can be 2 to 4 of those mentioned before. But there was one time that I could never have predicted. 

A tall man, dressed in a suit and elegant clothes, extremely pale and old, his eyes were not very visible because of his hat, but they were bright and seemed to pierce me.

He didn't say anything, he just handed me a completely black photo. I didn't know what to expect, but I decided to look for something anyway; that's what I did, I helped people spiritually. 

After searching for a long time, I felt something holding me back, but there was nothing there. I thought I was dealing with an obsessive spirit myself, but it was much worse. 

My vision began to darken, black spots appeared, and what remained was blurry. I felt my skin begin to burn; it hurt as if all my blood was being drained from me. I almost fell out of my chair, And I fainted, but just before I managed to focus on the photo, which was no longer dark.

That's when I understood, it was a picture of hell itself, and when I woke up, everything was normal, the picture wasn't on my computer. It was like I'd almost gone to hell for a second, the man wasnt there. 

Written in blood on the floor were: "You can't do anything, give up or see my home again", I felt nauseous, but it was blood, and there was a nail in my throat that came out, hurting me a lot. 

My room smelled horribly of carrion; I could barely stand. I ran out and went straight to church, confessed, and did everything I could to stop it. I burned all the stuff-in my house and I restarted my life.

But even today I feel watched, trapped while I sleep, and I frequently experience sleep paralysis. I want to pass my profession on, to someone to protect others, but honestly, nobody deserves this.
