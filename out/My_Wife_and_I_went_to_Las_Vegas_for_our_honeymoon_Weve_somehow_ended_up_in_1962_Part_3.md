“So….we’ve somehow ended up sixty-one years in the past”  
  
 Paula spoke in a voice which betrayed the bundle of nerves she’d become ever since she’d seen the date on the newspaper I’d bought. It currently sat on the glass coffee table in our hotel room as quiet as a church mouse, and yet the picture of a man who’d be assassinated only a year later might as well have had a tornado siren growing out of it. To say our lunch, as delicious as it had been, had been permeated with an awkward, strained silence would be an understatement of massive proportions. As soon as we’d finished eating and paid the bill, the two of us had practically dashed back to the relative safety and privacy of our room to talk and try and get our heads round our current predicament.  
  
Paula finally stopped pacing back and forth and looked at me, wrapping a lock of her hair around her finger and biting her lip. “But…how?” she finally asked. I shook my head, unable to give her the answer she so desperately sought for. I’m not a scientist by any stretch of the imagination; hell, I’m barely qualified to work as a manager for my company in the first place. “I honestly don’t know, honey” I said quietly, “Up until today, I thought time travel was impossible. Something only talked about seriously by people nostalgic for an era they could never return to, or by those without both feet in reality. But…it seems *they* were right the whole time…” I trailed off, shaking my head as my mind fought to push away what I could plainly see in front of me to be true.  
  
I stood up from the couch and walked across to the balcony door. It faced out onto the main drag, and looking down, I watched the endless procession of vintage cars move up and down the boulevard. *No, not vintage cars, Danny*, my mind whispered to me. *They’re modern day cars for everyone. Everyone but you*. I turned away and back to my wife, who was now perched on the edge of the couch. She looked up at me, a mixture of confusion and worry filling her face. Crossing back over, I sat down next to her and wrapped her in my arms. I sighed. After a moment, she pulled away and looked at me, nodding in appreciation. “Look, however we’ve ended up in this situation, we need to keep a level head here” I said to her, “We need to keep calm and make sure, above all else, we stay okay” Paula stayed quiet for a moment, then nodded. “I agree” She stood up from the couch and began pacing again, a trademark sign she was deep in thought.  
  
“Okay, the first thing we need to do, is make sure we don’t stand out anymore than necessary” she continued, “So, we’ll call down to reception and ask them where the nearest clothing store is. We’ll get ourselves some clothes to blend in with everyone else” She suddenly looked up at me. “But what are we going to do about money?” she asked. I searched my mind for older facts about the past I learned from hours of scouring the internet. “Well, we’re already very well set for money, because if I remember correctly, after what we spent on the hotel room and lunch, we still have about the equivalent of eight or nine grand left. *But*, I know that won’t last forever, so, I say, with a lot of caution, we try and bet a little money here and there on things such as horse and greyhound racing. Maybe even try some of the slot machines. But not too much, though. Vegas in the sixties was still as rigged as Vegas in the 21st Century, after all”  
  
Paula nodded, seemingly satisfied with my answer. “Well, that’ll possibly help. We have two weeks booked here, so we’ll be able to, hopefully find a way to get…” she trailed off and looked at me. “Danny, how are we going to get back to our own time?” I ran my fingers through my hair; she’d asked the very question I’d been pondering over since lunch. I sighed. *It’d be so much easier if we knew how we’d gotten here in the first place. Then we could simply do the reverse to return…if that’d even work*. “I honestly don’t know, sweetheart” I admitted, “But, we’ll cross that bridge when we do” A lightbulb suddenly went off inside my head, and I shot up to my feet like I’d been struck by lightning. “The elevator operator!” For a moment, Paula’s face remained blank, then realization crossed her face. “Of course!” she exclaimed, “He’d mentioned how others dressed like us had shown up before. That means others have accidentally traveled back in time, and it means they may have found a way back!”  
  
A smile crossed her face. “If we can talk to him, maybe others who’ve seen them before, we might be able to figure out what they did” I nodded, already having come to the same conclusion as her and returned her smile. *And that is why this woman is my wife; she has both beauty and brains*. “Until we’re able to, though, I say, let’s try and enjoy our time here. We’re in a time neither of us thought we’d ever see outside of pictures and films. So, let’s take it in while we can. Go to the shows, see the sights, do all we can while we can” Paula grinned. “Took the thought right out of my head, darling” she said, crossing to me and wrapping her arms around my neck before pressing her lips to mine. “We always heard about the swingin' sixties. Time to find out how swinging they really were”  
  
Unfortunately, it turned out that the elevator operator we’d seen that morning had the next week off, and wouldn’t be returning until the following Friday. So, in the meantime, Paula and I did our best to enjoy ourselves. It really wasn’t that hard; In fact, 1962, especially in Vegas, was extremely fun. The two of us each bought several sets of period clothing as we’d planned. Wearing a suit outside of company meetings felt incredibly weird, I must say. But man, did Paula look stunning when she walked out of the woman’s clothing shop, clad in an ornate white dress with straps which criss-crossed underneath her neck and a pair of high heels. “Wow” I breathed as she stepped outside and twirled around for me to see, causing her face to turn red.   
  
My plan to try and make money off the casino games and betting actually worked out better than I thought it would. Paula had always been amazing at card games such as poker and blackjack, while thanks to my old man and his love of visiting the horse and dog tracks in the nineties and early 2000s when he was still alive, I’d picked up on how to more often than not pick up on the contestants most likely to win. Between the two of us, we made over $3,000 in three days; more than enough to cover what we’d need.  
  
And to say nothing about the amazing shows we went to see. Watching legends of the previous generation such as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. perform at *The Sands* was nothing short of amazing, sitting in the huge room which filled with a hazy cloud of cigarette smoke as Old Blue Eyes and company belted out some of their biggest hits. The shows which *The Dunes* had on were amazing as well. Arthur had been right when he said that Diana Dors had an amazing singing voice. When we sat down at our table and saw her walk out onto stage that first night, Paula gasped aloud. For my part, so did I; The singer and actress looked uncannily like my wife. “You could be her younger freakin’ sister” I whispered to her as the lights went down. She simply looked at me, laughed softly and nodded. Apparently, we weren’t the only ones to have that thought; after spotting us in the audience, I saw Diana do a double take at my wife, before continuing with her performance like the professional I could tell she must be. After the show, she came over to us to introduce herself.  
   
“My dear, you and I are almost dead ringers for each other!” she exclaimed to Paula with an accent that instantly gave her away as British. Almost instantly, the two women seemed to connect and develop an friendship with one another, to the point it ended up with us being invited to dinner with her and her husband. Who, to my shock, turned out to be Richard Dawson of *Hogan’s Heroes* and *Family Feud* fame. I’d grown up seeing reruns of both shows on TV when I stayed home sick from school. Of course, seeing as neither of those things had happened yet, I had to keep my mouth shut and pretend I didn’t know who he was. After an amazing dinner, Diana personally extended an invitation for us to attend her shows, and the whole of *La Parisienne* the entire time we were staying at the hotel at a specially reserved table, as her guests. And so, we made a ritual for the next twelve days or so out of ending our days watching her sing her heart out. To this day, I can still close my eyes and hear her voice echoing in that room. I likely will the rest of my life. The two of us had an amazing time. Everything seemed almost too good to be true, too amazing and fun.  
  
Except for something I never told Paula about. Something I know she would have flipped out over.  
  
I only really noticed it on the fourth day. I’d pushed the terrifying incidents from the parking lot and the elevator out of my mind in an effort to enjoy myself. In fact, I’d managed to half convince myself that the elevator incident had, in fact, been a hallucination, and I’d simply lost my cell phone somewhere else. But that illusion was shattered when we stepped off the elevator and waved to Arthur. Because someone…or *something*, stepped out from the shadows behind him. Just long enough for me, and me alone to see, before stepping back and seeming to melt away in the darkness.   
  
It was one of the black clad figures. From my nightmare dash through what I could only describe as the hellish, nightmare version of the hotel. And almost as if to drive home the point that it hadn’t been a dream, I saw it raise its hand and wave something at me. Something which I immediately recognized, and made all the blood drain out of my face. It was my smartphone. *Oh, fuck me*, my mind quietly whispered to itself as the figure vanished back into the black.  
  
After that first encounter, I began to realize that the two of us were being followed almost everywhere we went. Whoever they were, were extremely good at not standing out. They always acted so inconspicuous, always blending in with the crowds around them. I only caught onto to them when I began to see the same hats and coats filtering through the crowds. But they were always careful enough to never let me see their faces. They’d always duck their heads, shielding their features with the wide brims of their hats. But they were always there. To say I began to feel paranoid and fearful would be the understatement of the century. I felt like a character in an old Alfred Hitchcock film, a mouse stalked by a cat which didn’t want to catch and eat it yet, but wanted its prey to know it was there. I would manage to push it out of my mind when Paula and I began to have fun, but whenever I would catch sight of them, the happy atmosphere would pop like a child’s balloon.  
  
By the next Thursday, my nerves were completely fried, and as much as I enjoyed the fun times we had, all I wanted was to speak to the elevator operator the next day and find a way to get back home. Paula noticed, and when she asked me what was wrong, I did something which I still regret. I lied. I told her it was just the stress of getting back to modern times, not wanting to freak her out by telling her we were being tailed by God only knew who. I will always count that as one of my biggest mistakes, something done out of some fucking ridiculous sense of wanting to protect her. If I hadn’t been so stupid, it might have saved us a lot of the horror still to come.  
  
The two of us had just stepped off the elevator, heading for what might very well be the final show in *The Dunes* we’d ever attend when we heard a voice call out to us. “Mr. and Mrs. Clements!” I turned to see Arthur beaming at us and waving us over to him. “You two are due to check out soon, I see” he said, looking down into the guest ledger on the counter in front of him. Paula and I exchanged a pensive look at each other before I spoke. “Well, we’re not exactly sure whether we’ll be leaving on Sunday or not, Arthur” I said. Paula spoke up. “Yeah, you see, we may end up having more time we’re able to spend here, and we may just end up extending our stay another week or so ago. That is, if we’re able to” I silently prayed we wouldn’t be told that our room wasn’t reserved; if it was, we had another problem to add onto our plate.  
   
But Arthur simply gave us his trademark smile. “Absolutely, you two! We have no other reservations for your room for the next two weeks, at least. Just let me know before Saturday night if you’d like to extend your stay!” We thanked him, and with that problem solved, hurried to catch Diana and the rest of the performance. Even after seeing it so many times I’d mentally mapped exactly when and where everything would happen, we still enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. When it ended, Diana came over and told us, not without a slight trace of sadness in her voice, that she and her husband were flying back to Los Angeles the following morning. Apparently, she was going to be appearing on a game show called *Stump the Stars* in a few months time. It was a bit of a bittersweet parting, to say the least. Paula and her shared a hug goodbye, and so did I a moment later.

“Don’t forget about us, okay?” I said to her after stepping back from our embrace. I hadn’t intended for the words which I'd whispered in my head to slip out, but they had. I saw Paula shoot me a bit of a concerned look out of the corner of my eye. Diana let out a laugh, but I could see a bit of a curious look enter her eyes. “Why, I don’t think I could ever forget either of you two” she said, “Especially not where you’re married to my doppelganger!” I laughed back, but for a moment, I internally debated about telling her the truth. About where Paula and I were from, *when* we were from, and everything in between. But I held my tongue, knowing it could end badly if I did. And so, the two of us bid her a safe flight and watched her leave the auditorium for the last time.  
  
“Come on, darling” Paula said, taking me by the arm, “Let’s get back up to our room and get some sleep. We have a busy day tomorrow” I nodded, allowing her to lead me back through the lobby to the bank of elevators. Along the way, though, I made my head swivel around like an owl’s, searching in all directions for any sign of our stalkers. But I saw no one. No men in coats and hats. In a way, it filled me with a bit of a relief. But it also made me feel more on edge than ever. Not seeing hide or hair of them made it feel like something was up. *I pray to God it’s not. I just want to get up to our room to sleep*.  
  
The elevator let out its now familiar *ding*, and the doors slid open. To my shock, the man who’d been manning the elevator controls the last few days was gone. Instead, the young man who we’d been waiting to return was running the controls. Paula and I shared a surprised look, then both entered the elevator quickly. According to Arthur, the kid shouldn’t have been working again until tomorrow. *I don’t know, maybe he came back on a day early to cover someone else’s shift or something*, I thought to myself. *Who cares, anyways? This is your chance to talk to him!*  
  
The doors closed, and the elevator began its climb up to our floor. I waited for a few seconds before turning to the man. “Uh, ‘scuse me?” I said. The man turned to look at me, and after a few seconds, his blank look was replaced with one of recognition. “Ah, hello you two!” he said cheerfully, “I see you managed to wrangle yourself up some normal looking clothes, huh? Have you two enjoyed your time here?” Both of us nodded. “Yes, we did, thank you for asking” I said, then pressed on before he could say anything. “Look, you said you’ve seen others like us before, right? People who seem out of place, dressed funny and all that?” The man nodded. “Yes, sir. Ever since I started working here three or four years ago, every once in a while we’ll get, well, pardon my saying so, but odd looking folks showing up occasionally. Management told me it’s happened ever since this place opened seven years ago”   
  
I felt a pang of surprise shoot through me. *Ever since seven years ago…1955? People have accidentally wound up in the past from the present for that long? But…why did no one ever say anything about it?* Another thought crossed my mind, one which worried me. *Maybe they were never able to get back*. I pushed that thought away; I needed to keep my head to keep asking the man questions. But Paula jumped in before I could open my mouth again. “Well, we just wanted to know…what happened to them? How long did they stay here? Did they check out and drive off like everyone else?” The man rubbed his chin as he thought. “Honestly, ma’am, I can’t answer *all* of those questions. I only work the elevators” *Shit*. I saw a look of disappointment fall over Paula’s features. But then the man continued.  
  
“*However*, I do know that many of them stayed only a week or two at most. Fourteen days was the longest I saw any of them stay. I did ask the management a time or two the same questions you asked me. And I always was told they did check out and left. The guys running the valet always told me their odd looking cars always left the parking lot. So, I can only assume that they *did* drive away” Now he gave us a bit of a puzzled look. “If I may be so bold as to ask, why did you want to know?” Paula and I quickly exchanged a look. Both of us immediately realized we’d accidentally walked into a situation we couldn’t easily explain away. Especially with our specific questions. She shrugged at me as if to say *I don’t know what to say to that*.  
  
For a second, I mulled over our options in my head, trying to decide what to do. But then, a single thought swam forward. *The hell with it. It’s time to come clean*. I turned to the man. “To be honest sir, I’m not sure if you’d believe me if we told you the true reason we asked them” I felt my wife grab my forearm, hard. The elevator operator raised an eyebrow. “Why don’t you try me?” he said, “I’ve heard all sorts of wild things in my time here. How wilder could what you say be than all of it?” Paula tugged on my arm harder. “Danny, *don’t*, we don’t know what’ll happen if we tell someone the truth!” I turned to her. “Paula, this may the only way to find out how to get back” I said quietly, “As long as we only tell one person, I think we’ll be okay” She bit her lip apprehensively, but eventually nodded. I returned the gesture, then turned to the man to my right to start talking.  
  
And then the elevator’s lights went out again, plunging us into almost pitch blackness. Instantly, my heart began to pound furiously in my chest as the memory I tried so desperately hard to push away surged forward, memories of appearing alone and being chased by the black clad figures. But this time was different. I could still hear Paula breathing, now in a slightly panicked, shallow way. I felt her grab onto my arm, and a slight amount of relief passed through me. “Stupid piece of junk” I heard the elevator operator mutter to my right, and then he raised his voice. “Just give me a moment, you two. This happens every once in a while” I heard him step away and begin to fumble with something. “It’s alright, sweetheart” I whispered to Paula as I felt her press against my side.  
  
Before she had a chance to reply, though, another sound reached us. I couldn’t tell what it was exactly, or where in the elevator it came from. But it made my already anxiety ridden mind swirl with nightmarish images. Images of a black clad figure raising an axe to plunge into my skull. *Please, God no, Please, God no* I began mentally whispering. A moment later, my prayers seemed to be answered as the lights came back on and the elevator began to move upwards again. I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding in and turned to my wife. “See, we’re okay” I said, smiling at her. Her blue eyes locked with mine, and she returned the smile.  
  
But only for a moment.  
  
I watched her eyes slide away from me and look somewhere behind me. I saw her face suddenly turn pale, and a look of utter terror slide over her features like a mask. She began breathing rapidly and backed up until her back was against the elevator wall. A colossal tidal wave of fear and dread surged through me at her reaction. I was beyond terrified to turn around. The woman was someone who didn’t scare easily, a quality of hers I always loved. So, to see her like this, only meant something horrible was now behind me. But I knew whether or not I wanted to, I *had* to look. Swallowing hard, I slowly turned around.   
  
It only took a split second to notice the two things she had seen. The first was that the elevator operator lay on the floor of the elevator on his back. His arms and legs were splayed out, and for a moment, I feared the worst. But then I saw his chest rise and fall, and realized he was merely unconscious. The realization brought a microsecond of comfort and relief to me. But it was shattered by the second detail, which made me rapidly back up to stand just in front of my wife, arms protectively held out as if to shield her.  
  
We were no longer alone in the elevator.  
  
A massive figure in a black coat and hat, one which had been tipped down to hide the wearer’s face stood almost exactly where I’d last seen the operator. Whoever it was had to be at least 6’4 or taller. It was perfectly still and unmoving as the elevator continued towards our floor. To make matters worse, I couldn’t hear the figure breathing, which sent another lightning bolt of fear coursing through me. I shot the floor indicator over the doors a quick sidelong glance, seeing we were only three floors away from ours.  
   
And then, as the last floor passed, it spoke.  
  
“Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Clements” It was clearly a man, one who spoke with a deep, gravelly voice as though he’d smoked two or three packs of cigarettes a day for years. My heart practically *stopped*. *Our names…they know our fucking names…* “What….the fuck…?” I heard Paula breathe out behind me. Her words apparently amused the man, because he began to let out a chuckle, one which sounded like nails on a chalkboard. “Yes. *What* the fuck, indeed” he muttered, raising his hat just enough for us to see he wore a truly wicked smile, but not enough to see his eyes. I felt the elevator come to a stop as it reached our floor. I remained where I was, but I slowly reached my hand behind me for Paula’s. *We have only one shot to get out of this elevator alive*. Thankfully, I felt her grab it a moment later.   
  
“What the *fuck* do you people want?” I finally demanded. For a few seconds, there was silence, until I heard the elevator *ding*. And then, the figure spoke, all trace of humor gone from his voice. “I think you know, Mr. Clements” he said. *Oh, shit…*  
  
Before I had another moment to think, the figure suddenly turned and lunged for us, letting out a cry. A cry I’d heard before; it was the same voice I’d heard from the black clad figure last week.  
But I’d already anticipated the man’s lunge and had been lying in wait. The second he exploded into motion, so did I. The biggest saving grace for us was that the elevator doors had begun to open as the man had spoken, and provided us an avenue to escape. I pulled hard on Paula’s arm, practically shoving her out of the elevator ahead of me into the hall. The man tried to course correct as we dodged his attack, but he was far too tall to do so at the very last moment. He crashed headfirst into the wall of the elevator with a rather sickening *crunch* of wood paneling and fell to the floor, his hat tumbling off his head and revealing his identity to us. I heard Paula let out a gasp as she stumbled to her feet.  
  
“The fucking *bellhop*?!” she almost screamed. Indeed, the man who turned to look up at us with a mixture of frustration and hatred was the same bellhop who’d pulled our luggage from the trunk of my car the night we’d arrived. *You gotta be fucking kidding…* But I had no time to think anything more beyond that. The man had begun to scramble to his feet. I dashed forward again, reaching around the inside corner of the elevator with a frantically searching hand. The raised round edges of the floor buttons met my fingers, and I slammed my palm down, hitting as many of them as I could. The elevator let out another *ding*, and I leapt backwards as the doors rapidly closed. The man leapt for us, but a second too late; we both heard him slam into the closed doors and scream out in frustration. It was the same “Gah!” he’d made when I’d dodged him in the black, empty version of the hotel.  
  
The thought suddenly made me whirl around. I feared I’d suddenly see nothing but darkness around us, that we’d been sent to that hellish alternate version when the lights in the elevator had gone out. To my relief, however, I saw only the same regular hallway we’d become well accustomed to the last eleven days. As I stared, I saw a door open down the hall and a sleepy, annoyed man poke his head out of the room. “Keep it down, will ya? I’ll call security if you keep that damn racket up” he said, then slammed the door shut. Paula and I exchanged a look, and then dashed for our room. Jamming the key into the lock, I practically wrenched the door open, then slammed it shut behind us and locked it. Finally, I grabbed one of the sturdy chairs from the sitting area, and wedged it under the doorknob. I knew it wouldn’t keep anyone out for long, especially if they really wanted to get in here, but at least it would give us a warning.  
  
I turned around to find Paula staring at me. “You recognized his voice” she whispered simply, “I saw the look on your face. You recognized it” For a moment, I was unsure about what to say. But I knew I couldn’t hide anything from her anymore. Not where things had now progressed to her being in danger. *I should’ve told her from the start*. So, I brought her over to the couch and sat her down, and proceeded to tell her everything. From exactly what had happened in the parking lot the first night we’d arrived, to the nightmare hotel I’d experienced the second day. And about the figures which had followed us the entire time we’d been out and about. I saw a mixture of fear and anger cross her face as I told her. I knew she was upset at me for not telling her sooner. But, happily, she held back on giving me a tongue lashing.  
  
“So, what do we do now?” she asked after I’d finished, her voice shaking slightly. I shook my head. “I can only think of one thing to do” She looked at me. “Call down to reception, have them call the cops, and…tell them…well, not tell where we’re from, but that we’ve been followed and attacked. In a way they’ll believe. We can’t deal with this on our own anymore” She began to play furiously with her hair and stayed silent for a few seconds, then slowly nodded. “You’re right. We *can’t* deal with this alone” She locked eyes with me, “*But*, while we wait for them to arrive, you and I are going to have a serious talk about hiding things from each other from now on” I sighed and nodded; I fully deserved what was about to come my way. “Alright, let me call downstairs” I said.  
  
Crossing to the bed, I sat on the edge and picked up the headset from the phone’s cradle. Punching in the single number for the front desk, I heard it begin ringing. After the third ring, the line was picked up. “Hello?” Instantly, I felt a wave of relief flash through me. It was Arthur. *I never thought I’d be so happy to hear another man’s voice.* “Arthur, this is Danny Clements in room 614” I said quickly. “Ah, Mr. Clements, I hope you and your wife enjoyed Ms. Dors’ last show!” he said jovially. “Yes, we did, thank you very much” I said, “But, I need to urgently speak to you” The jovialness seemed to deflate out of Arthur’s voice immediately. “Why, whatever’s the matter, young man?” he asked, his voice filled with concern. “We were just attacked in the elevator up to our room by one of your bellhops, the one who brought our luggage inside the night we arrived” I heard the man let out a surprised breath on his end of the line.  
  
“My, my, that’s serious, Mr. Clements” he said. “Yeah, you’re not joking. Listen, Arthur, I hate to do this, but I need you to call the police. Have them come to our room right away, please” A sudden dizzy spell struck me, and I put my free hand to my forehead to try and study myself. *I must be panicking too much, gotta stay calm.* But Arthur’s next words almost seemed to intensify my dizzy spell. “I don’t think we need to involve the police in such matters, Daniel”  
  
I felt a wave of confusion and shock wash over me. “Ex-excuse me?” I stammered out. Arthur’s voice spoke again, seemingly more authoritative than I’d ever heard it before. “I said, I don’t think we need to involve the police in such matters, Daniel. Not when we can solve them ourselves” I stood up from the bed, feeling my legs almost give out from under me and the room seem to spin around me. “The *hell* are you talking about, Arthur?!” I said weakly.  
  
“Exactly what I said twice, Daniel” he said, then laughed softly before continuing, “I thought you folks from the 21st Century were supposed to be *so* much smarter than us?” The biggest surge of terror flooded through my veins at his words, seemingly quicker than everything else. *He knows…?* “I think, what you two need, is a good night’s sleep. We’ve already sent something up to help you do so, compliments of the management” As his words reached my increasingly sluggish mind, I suddenly became aware of two things. The first was that Paula had collapsed onto the bed face first. For a moment, I feared she was dead. Then I realized, she was unconscious. The second, was that I heard the soft, hissing sound of something entering the room through the ventilation duct over the bed. *Gas…sleeping gas…or something….fuck…*  
  
Still holding the receiver, I began moving towards the sliding door to the balcony. One which now seemed miles away. *I need to…open it*. My legs gave out from under me, and I dropped to my knees on the carpet. Behind me, I heard the clattering sound of the phone’s cradle toppling off the desk, and I fell onto my side on the floor. Darkness began to envelop the edges of my vision and rapidly move inwards.  
  
“When you and your lovely wife wake up, you’ll understand everything” Arthur’s voice, now filled with an almost sadistic tone filtered into my ears from what sounded like miles away, and he let out another laugh. It would become one I would hear often in my nightmares after we made it back, even months later. Blackness overcame me, and as I slipped away, I heard him say two final words in a mocking, sing-song manner.  
  
“Sweet dreams!”
