Hello. I'm 22-years old, and my name is Nicholas. But I'd prefer if people called me Nich, pronounced as Nick. I work as a mortician, which incase you don't know what that means, it means that I prepare a deceased's remains for a funeral. Regularly, we preserve the body and making it presentable. We also assist in such factors such as casket selection, and when transporting the deceased from or to the funeral home. Usually, people would look at me with disgust when I explain them that I work as a mortician. But I don't blame them. After all, having to work on a person's corpse is not pretty and you need to have strong mental fortitude to do the job. I know you're wondering what N.R.D is and what it stands for. And to explain it fully, we'll have to go back about a year and a half.

...

*A month prior to the incident.*

I had just recently turned 21 at the time. It was 2:10 AM and I was currently driving over to my place of work under the yellow light of the dimly lit streets. The place I worked, a funeral home,  was situated near the outskirts of ##### in Massachusetts. To say this job was exhausting, was an understatement. I've gained many sleepless nights waking up in the dead of the night and having to work on haunting corpses. At least I've gotten used to it. I don't feel that's okay though. To be able to operate a deceased casually like it was another Tuesday was nothing short of unsettling. It really makes you feel detached from humanity.

Anyways, after about an hour drive, I would have finally reached the funeral home. As I pulled into the funeral home's parking lot, the familiar sight of the building greeted me. Its imposing silhouette against the night sky no longer sent a shiver down my spine. I switched off the engine and sat in the darkness for a moment, still somewhat tired. I stepped out of the car soon afterwards. The crisp night air contrasted the lingering smell of the car. The only sounds that filled the night sky was the crickets chirping and the faint sounds of owls hooting. It was moments like these that made me question my choice of profession, yet here I was, drawn to the quiet solace of the funeral home once again.

With a sigh, I made my way to the entrance, the echo of my footsteps resonating in the empty corridor. I reached for the doorknob and pushed open the door. The dimly lit interior welcomed me like an old friend, the soft glow of candles casting long shadows across the polished floors. The air was heavy with the scent of embalming fluid, a scent that had become all too familiar to me over the years.

"Back to my natural habitat."

I walked into the preparation room, or the embalming room, to be correct.  Shortly after walking inside, I was greeted by a white sheet that covered the deceased. The luminescent lamp shone down on the body overhead and barely illuminated the room. The deceased in question was a young man, only about 28-years old. For legal reasons, I obviously can't tell you the name of this person. But their cause of death was nothing short of strange. According to the document, they found the body untouched, but his organs were turned inside out. Before inexplicably disappearing. As in his organs had disappeared completely without a trace, yet he still showed signs of somehow being alive. Crazy. What does that mean? I have no idea, and I would rather not anyways.

When I removed the sheet, I could tell that the body had already been worked on. Clearly by one of my other coworkers. I didn't care much though, it just meant that I would be able to finish sooner than I thought. I put on my gloves, grabbing the scalpel from the wide range of clinical tools on the tray next to me. With a precise movement, I brought the scalpel to the deceased before creating a small incision on the neck, just big enough to where it wouldn't cause trauma in the surrounding tissue. Afterwards, I grabbed the tube (or cannula) connected to an embalming machine and inserted it into the incision, securing it in place. I activated the machine and simultaneously it began pumping embalming fluid while also draining out blood.

After a while, it stopped pumping fluid and so I quickly began closing up the incision. Usually after this, I would do something called Cavity Embalming where we similarly preserve the internal organs. But you know, since no organs, I couldn't really do that. So of course, I decided to skip on to the next step. I looked around for a tool, which I've forgotten the name of, but was commonly used to close the mouth shut.

"Ah shit, where is it?"

Without warning, the body would just suddenly sit up and stare down the hallway. It gave me quite a fright at first but then I remembered that bodies can sometimes sit up after death, because of gas releasing or something. I laid the body back down and continued looking. The tool was nowhere in sight. Usually, I would have it next to my other tools for convenience but if I had to guess, someone must've placed it back in inventory, where all the other stuff is. So, I began making my way towards inventory. The inventory area of the funeral home is a spacious room with rows of shelves and display cases. On the shelves were various caskets of different styles, materials, and finishes. There are also urns, keepsakes, and other funeral merchandise neatly arranged for viewing. The room is well-lit with overhead lights, making it easy to see the details of each item. 

I began searching through the cabinets, until I eventually found the tool, which I remember the name now. It was a Needle Injector.

"Found it finally..."

Right after I said that, I would hear a loud crash of tools and other objects seemingly coming from the embalming room. I quickly ran over, my heart dropping into my stomach. The body was gone. I looked to the side at the window, which was completely wide open. I couldn't understand what happened. I tried to make sense of it, some reasonable explanation on why this happened. My heart was already thumping in my chest but it became more panicked as I hear another sudden loud crash come from another room. I pulled out my phone and began calling the police while running to the origin of the sound.

"911, who is it?" 

"H-Hi! I'm a mortician at the funeral home I'm working at, a-and I just think someone broke in."  

When I made it to the room I heard the sound from, the door was locked.

"Okay sir, stay calm. *Is the intruder near you?"*

I banged against the door, hoping to startle whoever had broken in if not scare them to leave.

"N-not currently. They're locked in a room and I'm trying to get in. "

"What? No-sir, don't-"

But before she could finish her sentence, I was swiftly able to get the door open, only to be greeted by a sight that froze me in terror. The same lifeless body I had just been preparing lay before me, now standing upright in the center of the room, staring at me with its open eyes. And to my horror, so were the other corpses. One of them suddenly flipped off the light, leaving me in pitch darkness. 

"Sir?" The voice of the 911 responder pierced the silence, but I was paralyzed, rendered speechless.

Then, as if snapped from a trance, my instincts screamed at me to run. With a sudden surge of adrenaline, I turned and bolted back into the hallway. The hallway swiftly faded into pitch darkness not a couple seconds after the rapid sounds of skin slapping against the floor reverberated around me. I suddenly smacked into a wall with a loud thud, recoiling backwards and landing on the floor with an almost intolerable throbbing headache. I was dazed and I'm sure there was blood trickling down my nose. 

The sounds of skin slapping against the floor again snapped me out of my daze and I clumsily got up to my feet to run. My nose might've been broken or dislocated but I was too frightened and the adrenaline coursing through me made me forget that pain. Then without warning, one of the lifeless corpses was suddenly in front of me and fortunately, I was just fast enough to stop myself from crashing into them. I stumbled back while looking up at them, my hands fumbling for something, anything besides me. My right hand grazed over a metal plate which I swiftly took grab of without realizing it. I yelled and with a powerful swing, I struck the corpse in the face with a loud bang. The corpse fell over immediately and slumped against the wall. 

I continued running, a faint light in the distance beginning to illuminate the hallway the closer I got. The footsteps behind me faded and in a matter of moments, I was back in the prep room. The adrenaline still coursing through my veins, I hurriedly grabbed my keys from the front desk in the drawer and began making my way towards the door. But suddenly, a cold, pale hand grabbed me on my shoulder and pulled my back. With strength I didn't even know I had, I grab the thing on the arm with a tight clutch before tossing it over my shoulder and into a shelve full of books. I shoulder bashed through the door and ran to my car. 

Before I could open the door however, once again, someone grabbed me on my shoulder. From the touch, I could tell it was an actual living human being.

I swiftly turned around, "GET THE HELL OFF OF ME!!!" 

The man quickly let go of me and held his hands up. 

"I'm trying to help." 

I turned back towards my car and fumbled with the keys, frantically trying to unlock the front door. 

The man spoke up again, "Drive home safely tonight. They're still learning." 

I turned back towards him, a mix of confusion and anger plastered on my face. 

"WHA-WHAT!?!?" I shouted in complete ridicule.

Then suddenly again, I would hear the sounds of glass shattering. I turned around to see one of the corpses laying down in the grass, a shattered window behind it. I turned back towards the man, but he was gone. Still with a little of adrenaline coursing in me, I finally unlocked the car door and swiftly got inside. 

... 

I couldn't sleep that night. Their faces were too horrid to vision. An awful presence realized. 

The cops didn't find any of the corpses that night. So, obviously the next course of action was contacting me, the last person at the scene. They couldn't pinpoint anything to me. I didn't tell them about the corpses moving. I fear that they would have me put in a mental hospital.

I should probably tell you what the N.R.D Disease is now. It stands for the Necrotic Reanimation Disease. ***There's a "disease" that causes dead things to move.*** But that's no damn disease. You tell me what fucking disease psychologically and physically attacks you. It's nothing I've ever seen before. I've quit my job since then. But still... 

**I feel like I can still see their pale and lifeless faces peeking from the woods.**
