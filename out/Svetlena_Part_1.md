The town didn’t have a real name anymore.

On maps, it was called **Pervozorsk**, but nobody said that out loud. When people talked about it at all, they just called it **“the town near the reactor.”** That’s what it was. That’s what it had been for fifty years—a place where people lived because of the nuclear plant, where men in thick suits worked with invisible poisons, where everything had **a faint metallic taste.**

By the time we were born, the reactor was already **dying.** The town followed.

People **left** if they could. Schools closed. Grocery stores turned to hollow shells. Stray dogs wandered the streets like they were waiting for something.

But some of us stayed.

And some of us found ways to pass the time.

Me and Mikhail had been friends since we were old enough to run.

There wasn’t much else to do in Pervozorsk, so we became experts in **wasting time.** We stole smokes from Mikhail’s uncle, set fire to trash cans, climbed on rooftops and watched the empty town from above. When we were fifteen, we started **sneaking past the reactor fences.**

Not inside. We weren’t idiots.

But behind it, where the **cooling towers** loomed over dead fields. Where old railway tracks vanished into the dirt. Where we could smoke weed in peace, lie on our backs, and stare at the sky like there was something up there waiting for us.

It was **our place.**

Until we saw **her.**

The first time, she was **standing there.**

Not close, but not far. About twenty meters away. Wrapped in layers of brown cloth.

She didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Mikhail exhaled smoke through his nose. “That’s not creepy at all.”

I waved at her. She didn’t wave back.

We tried to ignore her.

But the next time we came back—**she was there again.**

Watching.

Never speaking.

Never **closer.**

Until the day she was.

She spoke on a September evening.

The sky was **blood-orange,** the wind carrying a distant smell of burning plastic.

“Boys,” she called.

Her voice was **warm.** Like a grandmother’s voice. Like fresh bread and warm tea.

Mikhail and I froze.

She was standing by the old railway tracks now. Not far at all.

“You shouldn’t be here,” she said.

Mikhail laughed, flicking ash off his sleeve. “Neither should you, Babushka.”

She smiled. **Her teeth were small and round.** Like a child’s teeth.

“I am always here.”

I don’t know why, but my stomach turned.



She became **part of it.**

Every time we came, she was there.

She told us her name was **Svetlana.** She had lived in the town “since before the plant was born.” She liked watching the sky change colors.

She was **harmless.**

Mikhail called her **our radioactive guardian angel.**

She would warn us about drinking too much, tell us stories from the old Soviet days, scold us for swearing.

“You boys have kind hearts,” she would say, touching my cheek like a real grandmother. Her skin was **cold.**

Sometimes she brought **salted fish in a paper bag.**

We never saw where she lived.

She never asked us where we lived.

It felt **normal.**

It wasn’t.

Years passed.

We grew up.

Mikhail moved to Moscow. I stayed, working as a mechanic. The town kept **rotting.**

Then, one winter, Mikhail came back.

“Let’s go to the reactor,” he said. “For old times’ sake.”

I almost said no.

But I didn’t.

The plant was dead now.

The metal fences had collapsed. The windows were shattered. Everything was covered in a layer of **wet ash.**

And there she was.

Standing in the snow.

The same.

Same brown shawl.

Same dark eyes.

“My boys,” she whispered. “You’ve come home.”

The snow felt **heavier.**

I glanced at Mikhail. He was smiling, but his hands were deep in his pockets.

We sat with her one last time.

We talked.

She was warm and sweet, like before. Like **nothing had changed.**

Until she said it.



“I must tell you something.”

Her voice was different.

It had **layers now.** Like two people speaking at once.

I looked at her.

She was still smiling.

But her lips were **wrong.** They curled too far up, stretching toward her ears.

“There is something inside me,” she whispered.

The words sank into my skull like water filling my ears.

Mikhail laughed nervously. “What does that mean, Babushka?”

She leaned forward.

The air **went thick.**



“I have hooves where my ribs should be.”

The sky felt **lower.**

Mikhail stopped laughing.

Svetlana nodded, her head **tilting too far to the side.**

“I have run across lands no man has seen,” she said. “I have chewed the marrow from bones buried before your sun was born.”

The wind had stopped.

My stomach **curled in on itself.**

Mikhail stood up. “Okay, Babushka, you got us. That’s a hell of a joke.”

Her dark eyes gleamed.

“You will be **unmanned** by the sunrise.”

Silence.

Mikhail swallowed. “What?”

Svetlana touched his cheek.

And suddenly, **it all made sense.**

Her fingers **weren’t fingers.** They were **the ends of a bridle.**

Her teeth **weren’t teeth.** They were **nails.**

Something **heavy** pressed against my chest.

Mikhail pulled away, laughing again. “Jesus, Babushka. You scared the hell out of us.”

She smiled.

And for a **brief second,**

I swear to God,

Her smile stretched **all the way around her head.**

  


We left.

The snow **burned** beneath our feet.

We didn’t look back.

We didn’t talk.

And deep inside, I **knew**—

She hadn’t been lying.

One of us was going to die.

And she had already **picked which one.**



Weeks later, Mikhail was dead.

His mother told me they found him in bed.

His body was **blue.**

The autopsy said he choked to death. Something was lodged in his throat.

They pulled it out during examination.

A **centipede.**

Not a normal one.

A **black, segmented thing the size of a rat.**

I could hear Svetlana’s voice in my head.

**“You will be unmanned by the sunrise.”**

Mikhail was gone.

And I was still **whole.**

For now.
