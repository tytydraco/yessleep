I’ve never been fortunate enough to experience many near death experiences. The experiences that have been thrusted upon me have always had a sprinkle of finality to them, with Death's grasp around my neck tightening through each one. The first had been disorienting, resulting in my first visit to the room. After all these years I have come to the conclusion that sharing my stories will not bring any harm. The room awaits us all in the end and perhaps these words may bring some peace of mind to some.

I was seventeen years old the first time I died. It was a time of peace in my country, where old feuds were crumbling quietly in the background and acceptance was carved into every brick on the foundation of our newfound society. Still, there were those that opposed peace. Those that would rather die gripping their malice tightly, rather than letting it fade away. And they cared very little for those that would pay the price for their ignorance.

I was walking to school when the bombs started going off. In hindsight, I would have preferred bombs of a larger nature; ones that you hear about in American films. But these were smaller and less annihilating. These bombs were homemade and often proved to cause more serious injury than immediate death. I had felt the initial blowback from the first bomb as it knocked me down. The second had been closer to where I had landed, and my satchel did very little to protect me from its shrapnel.

The pain was all consuming, at first. I would have expected shock to kick in, for my brain to be unable to comprehend what was happening. But for the first few moments, which could have been seconds or minutes, I felt everything. Or at least what felt like everything. My eyes fell upon the bloody viscera that had once been my chest and then my vision started to fade. In what must have only been a few seconds or minutes later, the pain and sounds of the world began to fade.

I was vaguely reminded of the stories of dying so many others had described. A blinding white light, a tunnel so long that there seemed to be no reaching the end, and a feeling of floating. But I imagine that these brief glimpses into the truth are all we get from near death experiences. Just a faded glimpse of the truth, an echo of what we will all someday hear. When we are ready. And as the visions and echoes turned into solid ground and dark walls, I knew that I was ready. 

The darkness of the tunnel turned into a hallway. The walls were dark, carved with symbols that I couldn't quite focus on. My mind absorbed their appearance, but their meaning wasn't meant to be understood by me. The floor was dark as well, its surface rough like carved stone and wet like a light mist of rain had just fallen. And as I aimlessly ventured forward, the blinding light began to take further shape. The once overwhelming glow was now an outlined silhouette of a door with rays of lights bleeding out from its crevices. 

I remember running my hand over the door, the material being cool to the touch but unknown to me. It had carvings similar to the walls with a polished metal door handle. It was chilling as I touched it, the metal sticking to my skin for a brief moment as I withdrew my grip. But whatever awaited me beyond the door had seized my focus. I was still and hesitant, but something within me drew me towards whatever layed beyond. The fear of the unknown was forefront in my mind, but something told me that nothing good awaited me in the opposite direction. So, with a deep breath and the false confidence that only teenage youth can provide, I gripped the handle and turned it.

The brightness beyond the door crashed over me as I entered. The room was white and square, with no light sources that could be seen, despite it being perfectly lit. The floors, walls, and ceilings were all smooth and polished like marble yet reflected no light. My eyes adjusted to the only thing that was inside the room. 

In the middle of the room was a dark table, which seemed to be made of a darkened wood. On either side of the table were two chairs made of the same material. And they all had the same, foreign carvings that the walls and door had had before I entered. And as I touched one of the chairs, a voice came from behind me.

"You can sit, if you'd like." It spoke.

I quickly turned around, nearly jumping out of my own skin. The voice was far from menacing but the silence that had existed up until this point had been deafening. And as my eyes fell upon the source, I became more confused.

The voice had originated from a small boy, maybe ten or eleven years of age. He had short, black hair trimmed neatly into a bowl cut and rectangular glasses. He had caramel brown skin and looked a lot like Harry Potter, though I'm sure my mind inserted that to force some kind of familiarity into the scene. 

I backed away slowly, my back hitting one of the tall chairs as I adjusted to the presence of the boy.

"Who are you? Where are we?" I asked quickly, my own voice seeming foreign in this quiet place.

The boy tilted his head slightly before walking around to the opposite chair, climbing into the chair with minor difficulty before adjusting his glasses.

"I don't have a name, really. You're welcome to use anything you'd like, but I'm afraid we won't be here long enough to get used to it." He spoke. He spoke in a strange tone, as if there were no dialect or hint of an accent. It was like he learned language from only reading about it and never hearing it.

"What happened to me? I remember the explosion..." I trailed off.

The boy nodded and for a moment his face flickered with something that resembled sorrow.

"Yes. You were in the second explosion. You did not survive." He stated flatly as he absently traced his fingertips over the carved etchings of the table.

On a normal day, I imagine the news of my death would have been more impactful to my psyche. Sadness, anger, maybe some casual upheaval of any furniture I could find. Perhaps it was the room itself or the shock of the news, but the logical answer he provided had a calming nature about it. I chose to remain seated across and took a deep breath.

"So...is this heaven?" I asked, looking around the room with what I assume was an unimpressed look.

The boy smiled at that, if only slightly. He too looked around the room, as if judging the place with me. He gave a small shrug before answering.

"I don't believe so, no." He spoke. He wasn't very forthcoming with information.

I sighed a bit, a bit disappointed with the lack of information.

"If I am dead...what happens now?" I said quickly.

The boy answered quickly this time, as if that were the only question he truly knew how to answer.

"Well, what would you like to happen?" He replied with his own question.

His confidence in asking the question was a bit frustrating. As if I were qualified to know such a thing.

"I guess it would be nice to not have died in the first place?" I said, half serious.

The boy gave another quick smile and seemed to think about my answer for a few seconds. He turned in his chair and jumped down, turning towards the back of the white room. I followed his gaze where it had landed on another door. The door was dark, just like the first, with the same metal handle. Had it been there all along? I hadn't recalled seeing it prior.

"Where does that lead?" I asked the boy, approaching the door alongside him.

"Out, of course." He said, as if the question were the silliest thing anyone had ever asked.

Something about his answer gave me the notion that any further conversation with him would be fruitless. So, I grabbed the handle and opened the door.

There wasn't anything after that moment. The door didn't reveal anything or lead anywhere. As soon as my mind attempted to swing the door open, I was back where I had begun my day. My alarm clock was blaring next to me, the silence of the white room long gone as all the sounds of reality filled my ears. The alarm, the air conditioning unit kicking on, the sounds of nature outside and the clashing of pots and glassware downstairs as my mother prepared breakfast.

And then came the mental images that flashed inside my head, all at once, as if my mind wanted to force me to relive every second of it. The blood and viscera that followed the explosion. It was as if I were standing over myself, watching my final moments of existence. The dread I felt for myself was a weight I wouldn't wish on anyone. The knowledge of your own demise isn't something we are meant to walk around with day to day. It takes away a natural optimism that, I believe, humans are meant to hold onto until the very end.

I stumbled as the visions subsided, kneeling next to my bed as the memories of that day slumped back into my control. I had remembered the day as if it had just happened. And with that knowledge I decided to stay home from school. Even if it had all been a dream, something in my gut told me that it hadn’t been.

The day at home should have been a comfortable one, but the dread that followed me from room to room was debilitating. It was like a dreadful cloak of sorrow that clung to my back as the time of my death approached. The explosion had only been a few blocks from my home when I had been walking to school so I would likely be hearing them shortly.

I hadn't known the exact time, but as the hour passed, I nearly laughed at the absurdity of it all. It had just been a dream. I was going to the kitchen to enjoy the food my mother had prepared when the first explosion went off. It was weaker, only shaking the windows a bit. My heart sank as the second went off moments later, the images of my demise flashing through my mind in time with the explosions.

The radicals of my city were quickly rounded up by enforcement officers, those harmed by the explosions were sent off to hospitals, and the deceased were collected and memorialized in the local newsprint later that week. It was an awful time for our neighborhood, but peace is something that is fought for and we all proved stronger and unified because of it all.

But, of course, the stories rarely have such optimistic resolutions or bright futures. The visions that came with my supposed second chance didn't halt after the explosions. But they did change. Instead of flashes of my previous death, I started to see new scenes. Scenes that involved me dying in a multitude of ways. Murder, accidents, and even suicides. Death became a plague in my mind, flashing before my eyes at any given moment.

And it wasn't until my eighteenth birthday that they finally stopped. And they stopped due to the one thing that even I knew, in the back of my mind, would stop them. Death. And no, before your mind skips ahead, I didn't end my own life. I wouldn’t have the wisdom for that quite yet. 

This time around it was quick, almost painless for the most part. I was at a crosswalk on my way home, the light above me signaling me to walk. As I prepared to cross, another vision of death captured my mind for a moment. It was a particularly gruesome vision, and I had collapsed to the ground. Within a moment I was back in the long hallway, peering towards the silhouetted door frame that led to the white room.

The slow walk to the room seemed to stretch on longer than last time. At this point, I knew very little of my surroundings and the fear of approaching the room was still present. Even if my last visit had been relatively peaceful, the wrongness of the place lingered. I wasn't meant to be there, and I felt it in my very being.

My hands rested upon the door handle, the cool metal sticking to the skin of my palm as I opened it and released my grip. The door swung open, and I was greeted by the same blinding light of the room. As I adjusted to the change in lighting I was met with the same view; the table, chairs, and blinding light of the rectangular room waiting for me. 

The boy was not here this time, at least not where I could see him. I ran my hands over the back of the carved chair, tracing the carvings with my fingertips before taking a seat at the table. I gave a sigh as I pondered the events that led to my return, the time that had been given to me for my second chance on earth.

I had used my time to return to school, foster friendships and continue my life. Had I wasted my time by doing such mundane things? Had the visions been a warning to correct my course, lest I be faced with death again? They never seemed relevant to my current situation or location, so I hadn't taken them as warnings. A slight tapping captured my attention as my mind wandered.

I looked up to see an elderly woman sitting across from me, her wrinkled fingertips tracing the carvings of the table as I had been. She had a calm smile on her face with a knowing stare as she bowed her head in greeting.

"I see you have returned." She said, her voice light. The way she spoke was much like the boy from my first visit, and something within my mind told me they were one in the same.

"I fell...I was having this strange vision of something terrible and...and then..." I trailed off, unable to remember what had happened.

"You were hit by a motorized vehicle. You fell into the path beforehand, it seems." She said softly, as if it were a memory from childhood to be reminded of.

I thought about it for a moment and pieced together the memories beyond the vision itself. Accepting my fate, I nodded.

"And so...what happens now? Do I just keep waking up the day of my death?" I asked.

"Is that what you would like to happen?" She quickly replied.

The question gave me pause. They had asked that question the first time around and my answer had seemed to define the outcome. I thought for a moment. What would I prefer to happen? Maybe another question would be best.

"How many times do I have to come back here?" I asked, not truly understanding my own question.

This question seemed to make them think for a moment. Or at least that's how I interpreted their prolonged silence. The woman smiled before answering, giving a slight bow of her greying head.

"As many times as it takes." She said, the finality of her tone lingering.

I took a deep breath as I stood from my chair, unsure of what to say. 

“If I go back again… am I going to die again?” I asked. 

Her blank stare seemed to be the only answer she was going to give to such a question. 

“I’d…I’d like another chance.” I decided. 

She smiled and nodded, getting up and walking to the door that I, once again, had not noticed. I approached it with her and reached for the handle, closing my eyes as I opened the door. 

And as the white room left me, I was surrounded by another white light, the glow of it enveloping me. And from there I took the first of many breaths as a new life awaited me. The memory of death wouldn’t follow me this time. But it would return, much like an old friend, at the end of my new life.

These were my first experiences with the white room. Little did I know that my run-ins with such a place were only just beginning. We must all go to the white room in the end. And, depending on our choices, some of us may not have the pleasure of only visiting once.
