PLEASE DON'T FALG THIS



I know this is a page for like "fictional" stories, but this experience is very confusing to me.

So, years ago, when I was five, I was awake late at night (at the time of course) maybe 9:00-10:00. I remember walking around in the living/family room of a house i used and there was a window that looked out to the front of the house, next to the front door. While I was walking, I looked out the window and looked at the lilies outside of the window and I froze. I got this weird gut feeling. Then there was an aerial view that showed me looking out the window, while there was something floating in the air. It looked like a black cloth, raggedy poncho with a hood. After 30 seconds, I was able to control my body again, I ran (or wobbled) towards my parents bedroom, but it was locked, so i found a spot in the hallway that couldn't be seen by any windows. When I woke up, my parents were holding me.

Ever since then. I had felt like I was being watched.

Two years later, I saw someone standing out of my window with a gun pointed at the window. (and got a gut feeling again) and screamed. I ran out of my room and came back and no one was there ( the window which looked out into my side yard with no gate)

And in the next year, I was almost kidnapped, and I got the same gut feeling. I still have paranoia even though nothing out of the ordinary has happened. So I wonder if that was some kind of warning or preparing me for a real event. If anyone could give me any possible ideas of what it means would be greatly appreciated. And I still have paranoia from that as well.

(that was written a few years ago)

Now, recently (in the past few months) I have talked with my parents about this situation. Spiritual and strange things is a regular occurrence in my mom's side of the family. While my mom doesn't have much spiritual awareness, (though she has been in the presence of a spirit, making it's self known) her sister and her mom have better abilities to recognize and sense things. Anyways, I was sharing with my parents about that situation, where I realize now was possibly possession or simply hallucination, and my parents begun to explain that this actually happened multiple times. Or (2 or 3 year old me) would perfectly describe being possessed. But of course, I wouldn't know what that even was..I was too young. My parents then took me to church more often because of that and apparently during the most holy and sacred parts of the services I would start screaming and crying and moving uncontrollably. Then when I went to pre-school, I some how heard people talking about horror movies (especially ESPEACILY IT) And for years I begged my parents to let me watch IT. Not to mention my strange infatuation with things like that, and how it never went away, concerned my parents. 

Also, recently I have been randomly fainting or blacking out the same way I did when I was "possessed"

Nowadays, whatever was attached to me I think has left me alone, for a few years now. But I think it's finding other ways to reach me. Because since it has stopped regularly following me and doing whatever it has done, I have been having strange, violent, spiritual, gory, death themed, and physic dreams more than ever. I can't really explain it right, so it might be hard to explain. But these dreams I have consist of murder, threats, my old traumas, a certain past love interest, dying, people trying to kill me or others, strange symbols, very detailed things I documented and then they actually happened, being visited by strange things (people, animals, unintelligible things, who knows) being abandoned in weird places and seeing things I wasn't supposed to see, and other things I think I can't even explain on here. THESE ARE ALL DREAMS IF THAT WASN'T CLEAR. 

  
I really don't know what to do, and if anyone has been through something similar, please help me.
