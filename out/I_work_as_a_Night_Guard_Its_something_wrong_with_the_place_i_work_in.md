I thought I had gotten a good summer job, working as a night watchman at a pizzeria, it wouldn't be a problem for sure. I told my mother that I had gotten a summer job. She was very happy. I would go there at 23:00. It was a bit strange though, so late at night? But I didn't think much more about it. I took the night bus there and went to the house. And meeting my boss. He whisked me to my office and then told me some important rules that would save me this night.  
\- Okay so John let me tell you all the rules that will keep you safe! :)  
\- Okay, as you can see here on the cams, camra 10 there they say. They are homeless so they stand up and sleep and ! :D

  
It was so strange and the figures included! All figures figures had black clothes black hoodie and a black hood and black sweatpants and with a black mouth guard and black ski goggles.  
\-And the one on the far left and can only go to the left corridor as you see! and the other two go to the right corridor, and here if they get close you can close the door if they come towards you or run towards you have a good time!

  
And then he went out. The time was now 12 o'clock at night: 12 Am, I looked at the cam where the "figures were standing" no one moved you one. I was really stressed. What was I supposed to do? but the silence was broken by footsteps. The figure on the far left had moved, it had moved to the chairs where all the guests sit when they eat. I looked at it in the camera. It completely flashed still. How was it even possible to stand so still. I look at the time: 1 Am.

 I started to sweat wondering what the hell this place was. I then saw that it turned red again, now it was only a few meters from the door, I watched it in the camera the whole time. But I didn't even see it moving, but when I looked in the camera in the corridor, it was standing there. I hit my head on the table. I don't want to die I don't want to die to a figure. Then when I looked in the camera, it wasn't there... I looked at the door light. Which lights up the corridor and then I saw it. There stood the figure in black looking down at me. It was about 2.5 meters long and looking down at me. With a scream that echoed throughout the house, I closed the door. I sat completely still, I was so scared I peed myself. I looked at the camras again and saw that the one on the far right.

Had moved and was now standing in the corridor it just.. stood there completely still. I looked at the other cameras and saw that the person standing in front of the door was standing in the cafeteria again when I opened the door. Then I heard someone running. It sounded like a little 6 year old running on a metal floor I heard the sound from the right corridor. I jumped out of my chair and closed the door at the last second. I closed the door and then I heard it just standing there outside and slamming the door slamming and slamming and it did that for like 10 seconds. before I heard it go away. I closed both doors and sat down on the bars and threw up straight on the floor because I was so fucking scared. Then I heard a loud bell sound and I looked at the clock: 7 Am. I had made it. I had completed my shift. I opened the doors and ran out of the pizzeria. I just took my wallet and phone and took the bus home. I ran into my house and ran to mom. I had told her everything. We decided to bring the police into this. Hope it will be good. wish me luck......
