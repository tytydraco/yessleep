Let me start off by saying I shouldn't have even come to work that day. It was a pristine Saturday morning, and I was standing on the deck of my uncle's swamp trailer inhaling the lovely springtime air. 

The tide was just starting to drift back in, so the water had a pungent odor to it. My uncle makes his living cleaning up trash and debris from local bodies of water; riverbeds, inland lakes, private reservoirs you name it.

Normally he would have a small team of local knuckleheads on the deck with him to sweep the waterbeds "clean" and sort through anything valuable. 

That was where the real money was of course, the things people threw away or carelessly lost. Cam would clean it off and pawn it. He once found a landmine fused to a pile of rocks, dusted it off and sold it to some army memorabilia collector. 

He claimed it was an unarmed mine found in the pacific theatre, his grandpappy had brought it back from the war. I don't know if the collector actually believed my uncle's lies or just thought the armed rock was neat, but Uncle Cam made a nice chunk of change off that guy.

During the summer I was his "wheelman" hitching his boat to the back of my pickup and taking him across the state, gig to gig. Decent money for a college kid, but truly boring work. 

So, when he offered me to pick up the wheels during spring break this year I respectfully declined. I thought that was the end of it, until he showed up at my parents' house-boat in tow, his right-hand man Cletus sulking at the front of his rental.

I opened the back door after a chorus of frantic pounding and incessant ringing, and there stood Uncle Cam; not even 9am and already reeking of cigars drenched in scotch. 

He broke out in smiles when I opened the door and dragged me in for a headlock, tussling my freshly showered hair. I could feel the bristles of his five O'clock shadow digging into shoulders as he hugged me. 

"Davey how the hell are ya, thought you would have left for Daytona by now." He bellowed, looking past me. "Ya father around I need his help with something." 

"He and ma left this morning, spending the weekend in Atlantic City." I explained.

 "Figures, told him I might need help this weekend since you were busy." He grumbled, his eyes starting to light up. "Are ya busy?" 

"Well, I don't officially leave until Sunday." I begrudged.  A meaty paw slapped me on the back, shooting me out the door. 

"Then listen I need ya help here. I got Cletus with me; he's pulling double duty with driving and all-" He waved over to Cletus, who gave a dismissive flick of his wrist. "-whiney little cocksucka- and Silvio dropped out of the gig. I need another set of hands."

"What-on the boat? I've never even gone fishing." I protested.

"What fishing, we hang out a little, drink some beer and drag a net across a little lake up north. Five hours work tops, cut you in for 40%"

"He ain't getting a fucking percent offa my shares." I heard Cletus fume from the rental.

"OOH with the mouth, this is a nice residential ya prick." Cam bellowed back. My uncle's Southie heritage always crept back into his tongue when he started to get angry.  "It's easy work Davey; you'll get a nice piece of change to bring down to Florida with ya." he said slyly.

He was right, my scumbag uncle. I had all but run through my summer savings and was dreading have to borrow money from my folks when they came back. 

So it was with heavy reluctance that I climbed aboard Cam's boat, bracing myself as Cletus lurched forward like he had never driven stick  in his life.

The boat, the *S.S Stromboli* as my uncle called it, was titled upwards just enough to lug it around but not so much that me and him weren't comfortably sitting in the cabin drinking. We still clung to our seats at every quick turn and steep hill, but it was a cozy enough ride. 

The *Stromboli* was a small fishing trawler my uncle had picked up at a police auction. It was tattered and weathered, yet Cam was adamant that all it had needed was a fresh coat of paint some sealant. Few years later and it hadn't sunk yet

Cam explained the job to me as we made our approach. Rackham county had a lake that had been closed to public use since 1995, it had been a summer camp at one point but that shut down due to a supposed e-coli outbreak. 

The lake was deemed toxic to the public and closed off. The rumor mill churned out some ridiculous gossip; the county was using it as a dump; the mob was using it to hide bodies. Occasionally some kids would hope the fence and come home with skin rashes that would last for weeks and itch twice as long.

Now the county was losing money and wanted to revitalize a sense of community by re-opening the old camp. The area had to be decontaminated of course, and that's where good old Uncle Cam came in. 

Now this wasn't some deep cleaning operation, my uncle was a small fry. He usually got hired to do some light surveying of the depths and minor dredging. 

He and his band of idiots would spend hours sorting through anything they found on the deck, and God help me today I was one of those idiots. 

After a while we arrived at the shore, as it were. Cletus nearly killed himself backing up enough to drop the boat into the water, and the three of us broke our backs getting it out of the shallows. 

There was probably a safer and more efficient way to get the boat in, but we were cracked for time and a little buzzed at this point.

My uncle fished for his treasure using a makeshift "rake" powered by a motor engine. The rake was three meters long and scooped at the end. He would slowly start at the end, then make his way across the muck, in a way that rarely got him stuck. 

It was long, boring work made easy by swapping tales and drinking brew. The lake, named Erin, stunk to high heaven. Like moss had crawled inside a crabhole to die.

The funny thing was the water was fairly clear. It had a slight orange tint to it, but it looked like you could dive right in. The high noon sun shone down on it, twinkling like a mountain spring. 

There were patches of pure orange foam cropped up on the surface, it looked like tie-dyed styrofoam drifting down the way. Cletus and I sat on the deck as Cam guided our cruise softly through the water. Cletus poked me in the ribs and pointed towards a nearby foam cluster.

"That there is Salmon spunk." He spat. "it's close to spawning season." 

"Lovely." I grumbled.

"Nah man, good news for us. Water's clean enough for fish its clean enough for humans." He summarized. "Makes our job a breeze."

"It already is, till we have to muck through the-muck." I stammered. Cletus eyed me with wide eyes.

"Honestly we find nothing I'll be happy. Your uncle ain't from around here; lotta stories about this stretch of wet." He mused. 

"He told me bits and pieces." I indulged. Cletus laughed when I mentioned the mob and toxic dump tales.

"Naw man, that's a bunch of bull to weed out the tourists. The real story-well you know this place used to house a camp, right? It was some uppity sleepaway for rich parents to dump their kids for the summer so they could learn to traverse the great outdoors-" He rolled his eyes.

 "-It was all controlled, they'd line up some BS activities to make em feel like real outdoorsmen, like archery with foam tips or kayaking back and forth five meters or so." He took a swig from his beer and savored it.

"Course the picked a horrible place for a camp, locals knew to stay away during the summer season. Heat brought out some mighty angry critters. The waters here run deeper than you'd think." He trailed off, letting my vulnerable imagination fill in the rest.

"*Pfft*, what is this *The Outer Limits?"* I scoffed. Cletus shook his head sadly.

"Call it whatever you want, locals like me know the tales of The Erin Lake Horror; how it would scuttle out of the depths at night, the scent of fresh meat drawing it in. The county covered it up of course, the real reason the camp closed."

"They said the thing crawled from cabin to cabin, crushing those kids to bit with powerful pincers." He made a faux clawing motion with his arms, crossing them to his chest like a mini t-rex.

"The Camp Erin slaughter was what it was called, cops came and all they found were bits and pieces strewn about. They never did find what did it. They did hear it though, a mournful chittering sound, like a giant crab howling at the moon." He imitated that sound, coughing at the end of his mimicry and taking another swig.

"Some say you can still hear that sound at night, as the beast hunts for its next meal. They say you won't even see it until its claws are wrapped around your neck, snapping it in two." He finished his ghost story with a ghastly tone, eyeing something behind me.

That's when I felt the icy grip of crustacean scented pincers pinch my neck. 

 I hollered like a banshee, jumping up and tossing my beer at the culprit, only to be meet with the belly busting laughs of Cletus and Cam.

 Cletus was falling out of his chair, that sickening infections donkey braying he was making made my stomach churn. 

Cam was holding a Stuffed lobster in his hands, one of the little nautical knickknacks he kept in the cabin. Scorn and embarrassment slapped me in the face till I was beet red as I composed myself.

"You frigging douchebags, was any of that even real." I screeched at them.

"Course not ya fucking mush guy,  wassa matter with you?" My uncle roared with laughter. I noticed the boat was still chugging along smoothly. Cletus sat back on his chair, a shit eating grin upon his face. 

"All good fun laddy buck. Hey Cam, shouldn't you get back to manning the wheel before we scuff the shore." He hinted. Cam waved his hand and went to steal my beer from the rickey camp chair I had been using. 

"It's on auto- we have about ten minutes before we hit shallows. Hot as hell back there, you never fixed that AC like I told ya, did you?" Cam accused. Before Cletus could attempt to defend his handywork the boat surged forward and came to a grinding halt.

Cam dropped the beer, shattering it all over the deck. He cursed and sprinted back to the cabin. The dredge motor was grinding its gears in protest, black smoke beginning to bellow out of it. 

I rushed over to help Cletus turn it off as Cam struggled with the boat engine. I could feel the vibrations putter to a pitiful end under my feet as we fought the motor.

The chain we used to bring up the scoop was entwined around it, something at the bottom too heavy for Cam's Frankensteined engine. Cam rushed out of the cabin as the motor started to wither and die. He pushed us aside and grabbed the chain and begin uncoiling it, grunting as he tried to assist it. 

We joined him of course; pulling that borderline 200 pond anchor up, fighting the pressure of a lake that wanted to keep whatever we had snared. I could feel blisters start to form and burst on my hand as I scrapped that soggy chain upward, tossing aside as much as we could to give the motor some leverage.

It was purring now, as we did its job. Finally, we could see the scoop at the surface of the water. Through the muck and pebbles we could make out a massive log.

 It looked like one of the scythe-like prongs had impaled the thing and had lodged it into the lakebed. It was only by sheer luck it didn't tear the motor outright and only forced a dead stop.

As our treasure bobbed to the surface, Cam reached forward and tried to get a good grip on it. We joined him and on the count of three we brought up the scoop, breaking our backs in the process. We dropped the thing onto the deck; an audible *thud* rang out.

It stank to high heaven, much worse than the shore. The scoop lay on the deck, covered in much and weeds. Embedded in it were small rocks, couple of shells and a few metal bits gleaning in the afternoon sun. 

Beer cans by the looks of it, part of me wondered if we had just hauled in our own garbage. The jewel of this display was the massive rotted out log. It was blackened and moist to the touch, soggy wood splintering out like a jaded lover.

There was some of the orange "foam" covering it, and I grimaced at the sight of it. Cam kneeled down, covering his face with his shirt. Cletus looked ill at the sight of it, which I took some small pleasure in. Cam got a curious look on his face and reached towards the log.

 With a grunt, he turned it over. Where the prong had impaled, we could see a dim glow; upon closer inspection it seemed there were hundreds of small pearl-like objects fused to the inside. Cam whistled, impressed at the amount.

Cletus and I leaned in as well, marveling at the sight. It was like something out of a fairytale, treasure surrounded by a golden aura. Except these weren't pearls, they were too clumped together, and you could make out tiny, black embryos in them. Cam stepped back, rubbing his chin deep in thought.

"Too close to the spawning grounds, I knew it, but you don't listen." Cletus grumbled. 

"Aw you didn't say shit, who you kidding. Davey go get one of the containers from outback, start filling it with water." He commanded, not taking his eyes off the prize. I obliged, though unsure of what the point was. I could hear Cletus arguing my point for me as I searched the cabin for the opaque plastic bin.

 "-look at that big ass thing, why we gonna lug it around?" He complained.

"Because we're sitting on a goldmine here, Clet. Look at this; a barrel full of caviar fresh from the sea." He proclaimed proudly.

"You aren't serious." Cleatus balked. "Christ on the cross Cam, this is a new low." He sounded disgusted.

"Wipe that puss off ya face. Only schmucks who eat caviar to begin with are rich snobs with too much time on their hands. Who's this hurting?" He countered. "You'll get your cut." I could hear my uncle sneering. 

I came back with the container and helped the two of them hide the log in the cabin. There was some more bickering about the dubious scam my uncle was trying to pull but I don't know why Cletus was surprised. Love him or hate him that was just who Cam was.

The trouble started when we tried to hide back to shore. The engine sputtered and gagged on itself, refusing to even lightly paddle to the shoreline. 

It turned out that snare trap had done more damage to the engine than we thought and would be stuck adrift in the middle of the lake until we fixed the stalling problem. The attempts to "fix" the engine resulted in the three of us laying anchor and drinking more beer.

Cletus claimed he could do it no problem, but Cam refused to let him touch it since he "fixed" the Ac. He ended up calling Silvio and offering him double his normal cut to drive out here and paddle over to us with spare parts.

Frankly it was a beautiful day out all things considered, So I think my uncle was just happy for the excuse to lay outside in the sun and drink. 

So that's what we did for the next couple of hours; huddle together basking in the late sun, down to our last case. The air had gotten a tad murky, and my vision blurred as I downed my tenth beer of the day.  We swapped tales and bickered over small things, as is tradition in our family I suppose.

The family temper always flared up when my uncle started drinking, and I wasn't too far behind as well as we listened to that smashed redneck ramble on. 

"-No I'm telling you boys, they don't hold a candle to Cash; senior or junior." he slurred. 

"The gall on this guy uncle Cam, you hearing it?" I barked at my uncle.

"I'm two feet away from you, why ya shouting." he winced. "Cash is a damn phoney, ya know he never really served time? Big myth." Cam teased

"Ay you take that back! He shot a man in Reno, why would he lie bout that?" He babbled. Cam roared with laughter then turned to me.

"You doing good in school kid? Have any problems with the deans or whoever ya know you can come to me ye?" He grasped me with his gorilla grip and gave me a loving yet solemn look. I nodded and he patted me on the back. Cletus looked oddly envious and was about to speak up when we heard it.

It was a piercing hissing noise, like air escaping a tire mixed with the wild cry of a cicada. We sat silent, bewildered at the bizarre sound. Cletus shifted uneasily. Sobering up in his expression. 

"Sil' say when he was getting here?" He whispered to Cam. He shrugged his shoulders in response.

"Last I heard he was probably about 20 minutes away. Had to get his frigging canoe outta storage he said." Cam chuckled. That shriek rang out once more, sounding closer this time. It felt hot all of a sudden, like the humidity had been dialed up to twelve.

 I wiped sweat from my brow and noticed the ghastly pale look on Cletus. His eyes were shifting back and forth, looking past us to the water. The sun was real low now, the sky violent with a dying orange hue. 

"*Madone* this heat." Cam muttered. 

"We should throw that log back in." Cletus uttered suddenly. Cam shot him a look.

"Selling bogus caviar isn't even the worst thing you guys have pulled." I laughed. "Remember the shaved cat fiasco couple years back?" Cam winced at the memory, but Cletus didn't let up.

"That ain't it, too weird looking them eggs-might be, I don't know poisonous or something." He blubbered out, grasping for straws as he evaded the truth. 

This was met by another round of laughter, cut short by more wailing. It sounded like it had risen below us from the depths. Cam got up, confusion pouring out of his face. Cletus franticly got up towards the cabin.

"You touch that fucking log they'll find you at the bottom of this goddamn lake." Uncle Cam roared. 

"Damn it all we need to give it back before its upon us." He raved, a hesitant look in his eyes. "That little prank I pulled on ya-I-might have embellished it but its real." He confessed. Now it was our turn to look confused. Cletus rambled on.

"My daddy worked at the camp when he was young, two kids snuck out onto the lake one night and only one came back, pale and cold as a witches teat. He claimed they had swum out to an old raft, and something had grabbed the other kid and pulled him under."

"They scoured the lake but-well they didn't find hide nor tail of him. The lost boy's folks claimed the other had drowned him and threatened to sue; camp director had a friend on city council and got it squashed though."

"Well, that's all very tragic Cletus but-"

"He saw it, my daddy. It had crawled onto the beach to savor its kill, he said it was five meters tall and was scarfing that poor boy's insides out when he came upon it. They didn't believe him but that's how the rumors started." Cletus was trembling now, wither it was true or not didn't matter, he believed it for sure.

 "Bunch of horse shit spewing out of that drunken gab of yours, they outta put a muzzle on this prick." Cam nudged me. Cletus looked like he was about to explode when the boat started to violently shake. We bobbed and weaved like we had just gotten our sea legs, and a loud thump from the bottom of the boat was heard.

That shrill cry was accompanied by a scuttling noise, like something was scurrying along the side of the boat. Cletus grabbed the nearest thing he could, an old fishing pole; its wires dangled and frayed around the rod. 

"Clet-clet stay away from the side." The tone of my uncle's voice was filled with fear now, and I was quickly sobering up to the idea that maybe Cletus knew what he was talking about. 

Without looking, he jabbed the pole downwards off the side, hitting something squishy that was clinging to the boat. Another hiss as the thing cried out and raised itself over the rail.

I can't begin to describe this horrid monstrosity that had climbed aboard.  It was at least four meters tall and vibrant in color, like someone had dumped a rainbow on it. It had two boxing glove-like claws that clung to its side mantis style. 

Two bulbous black eyes on stocks swayed in the late afternoon heat, its mouth filled with tendrils and mandibles. It flung its still submerged three-pronged tail in the air, squeeing as it rained down rancid lake water upon the deck.

Cletus stepped back, shivering at the sight of this massive shrimp beast. The thing raised one claw and in one quick motion thumped it towards Cletus' head. 

His head snapped back instantly, the muscles and veins in his neck simply tearing away at the speed of light. Within an instant he was dead, his head flying back towards us.

His face was a mangled bloody pulp, yet I could still see the terror in his eyes as they looked back at me. Blood spurted and gurgled from his neck like a water fountain as his still twitching body clung to the poll, a vice grip seizing in the final moments. The body collapsed to the deck, as the boat shifted to one side making a horrid groaning sound.

The beast sized us up, as prey or a threat to its young. Probably both, if I am being honest. 

My uncle grabbed me by the chest and dragged me out of my stupor as the thing roared and began to quickly close the gap between us. We managed to squeak into the cabin and slam the shoddy wooden door behind us.

It eyed us through the port hole and began thumping away at the door, every hit splintering the already weak wood. Looking around the crowded cabin, I eyed the water filled container and made a mad dash for it. 

I got it out and offered it to the beast, who hissed at the sight of it and pounded on the door harder. Cam pulled me back and stepped towards the log, raising a foot over it and looked the thing squarely in the eyes. It paused in its assault, and Cam got a bold look on him.

 "Yea-yeah you overgrown prawn cocksucker you understand this don't ya." He said uneasily. His eyes didn't leave its as he spoke to me. " Davey, I want you to go into the overhead drawer up there and get my gun." He tried to sound calm, and I obliged his request. 

The overheard was filled with papers and trinkets, and a few old bottles of his favorite scotch. Tucked away in the corner was a 9mm. I grabbed it, it felt heavy in my hand and my uncle motioned for it.

I quietly gave it to him, and he pointed it at the shrimp, who let out a low chortle; a growl, I think. Cam slowly lowered his foot and backed away from the container, nudging it closer to the door in fact. The shrimp took its que to barge down the door and hiss at us, drooling all over the place like a rabid wolf. 

"Take it, come on and just, get outta here." Cam muttered, as cool and collected as he could be. The thing unfurled a pincer and dragged the container over to it, cooing as it did so. Still, it seemed locked onto us both, ready to pounce.

 We were just barely out of its striking distance, I saw how quickly it could scuttle. My uncle knew this as well and told me:

"Sorry for dragging you into this Davey. You get outta here." he uttered. With that he opened fire on the beast, pushing me aside. I fell to the ground and scurried up as the thing rushed past me, tanking at least three-square shoots to the head. 

It thumped my uncle square in the chest, and he flew towards the cabin window, shattering it instantly. The shrimp was about to turn towards me when another shot rang out from the deck, blowing one of its stalking eyes off.

The menace turned its attention back to the deck and I ran out of there, jumping straight into the water. A blast of ice shocked me to the core as I began swimming to shore, wincing every time I heard a shot. Cam was wheezing at the thing, cursing at it with every slur he knew with the all the vigor a dying man could muster.

Halfway to shore I heard a loud splash behind me, but I just kept going. My mind pictured all manner of pinching creatures chasing after me. All it would take was one easy pinch to drag me down to the brine.

 I just kept swimming; I didn't stop till my feet barely sand and I was rushing out of there as fast as I could. I scurried to the ground and looked back at the boat. It was dead quiet on the lake, no guns no monster- no Cam.

I was breathing heavily then, my eyes stinging from the putrid water. I could taste metal in my mouth, and I coughed up a thick green slime I could only imagine came from when Cam shot the creature's chassis. I saw on the beach, curled up and shivering.

I waited for any sign that Cam was ok. I was in a trance; I didn't hear the rattle of the station wagon pulling up behind me. A door slammed shut and I turned, startled at the sight of Silvio standing beside his car, canoe strapped to the roof. He looked at me dumbfounded. 

"Davey, fucks Cam at?" 

When I eventually talked him into grabbing his gun and heading out there, we found the boat slathered in green fluid and Cam unconscious on the bow of the *Stromboli.* We rushed over, his respiration hard and jagged. It sounded like his entire chest cavity had collapsed. 

We carefully moved him out and brought him to the nearest hospital. I should mention that there was no sign of the mantis, or the egg filled log.

I sat with Silvio at the urgent care, hoping any news about Cam would be good. Sil assured me that nothing would happen, he'd be fine. 

He also mentioned that "mess" on the boat, whatever happened there, would stay between us. He would head back the next morning with some friends of his and tidy up the area. I tried to protest but he assured me it would be no trouble at all.

Finally I got the news that Cam was awake and wanted to speak with me. I found him lying on the hospital bed, his chest wrapped in so much gauze he looked like Al Capone if he was a mummy. 

He was hooked up to some kind of IV and slurred when he spoke. He had a grin on him, saying he got the thing, and we were gonna be rich. I didn't have the heart to tell him that it was gone, not then anyway.

This was a week ago now, and I'm writing this in the waiting room. I offered to drive him back him. Least I could do for the crazy bastard after he saved my life. 

Sil and his "friends" cleaned up the boat but still found no trace of the creature. Knowing the circles Uncle Cam runs in, I can only imagine what they really think went down on that boat. But I digress.

I can hear him cracking jokes in his room, asking the nurses out on a night on the town. He's a card my Uncle Cam. 

But I think the next time he asks me to go on a job with him, I'm going to pass. I'm not stepping foot on another boat. 

Not for all the caviar in the world.
