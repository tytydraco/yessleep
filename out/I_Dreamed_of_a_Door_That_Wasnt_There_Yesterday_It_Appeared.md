For as long as I can remember, I’ve been a restless sleeper. Not just tossing and turning, but the kind of dreaming that feels like you’re living a double life. Most of it is nonsense, fleeting images and feelings that disappear with the dawn.

But over the past few months, a particular dream started recurring.

It was always the same. I’d be standing in the hallway of my childhood home, staring at a blank section of wall between two bedrooms. Everything would feel wrong, like the air was too thick. Then, I’d notice something new—a faint outline of a door.

In the dream, I’d always reach for the handle, but it would dissolve under my touch. Behind the door, I could hear muffled sounds: whispers, faint music, or the rhythmic thud of something moving. But before I could open it, I’d wake up drenched in sweat, my chest tight with a feeling I couldn’t name.

I chalked it up to stress. Life hadn’t been easy lately. I’d moved back into the house after my mom passed away. Cleaning out her things, dealing with the memories, it was enough to make anyone's subconscious go haywire. The dreams, though unnerving, felt like another burden I had to carry.

But yesterday, everything changed.

I woke up late, groggy from another bad night. The dream had been more vivid than ever. I could feel the cool brass of the doorknob and hear the whispers, clearer this time:
"Stop... it hurts. It hurts. It hurts..."

Shaking off the unease, I went about my day. I had planned to repaint the upstairs hallway, so I grabbed the supplies and headed up. That’s when I saw it.

The door.

It was exactly as it had been in my dreams, nestled between the two bedrooms where there had always been solid wall. It was old, with peeling white paint and a tarnished brass knob. I stared at it for what felt like an eternity, my heart pounding.

“No,” I whispered to myself. “This can’t be real.”

I approached it cautiously, half-expecting it to vanish like it always did. But it didn’t. When I touched the knob, it was solid and cool against my palm.

I considered calling someone—a friend, maybe—but what would I say? “Hey, a random door just appeared in my house”? Instead, I decided to open it.

The door swung inward, revealing a narrow staircase spiraling down into darkness. The air that wafted up was damp and smelled of earth and decay. I hesitated, every instinct screaming at me to close the door and walk away.

But I didn’t.

Grabbing a flashlight from my toolbox, I stepped inside. The stairs creaked under my weight, and with each step, the smell grew stronger. The walls were lined with rough stone, unlike anything else in the house.

At the bottom of the staircase was another door, this one made of heavy wood with strange symbols carved into it. They weren’t any language I recognized—just jagged lines and swirling patterns. Or so I thought. Upon closer examination, the symbols seemed to look more like a child's chicken scratch than anything else. 

Despite my unease in this whole... ordeal... I tried to read the letters. 

"It... hurts?" I read outloud. 

The whispers started again.

"It hurts."

"It hurts it hurts it hurts"

They were louder now, almost urgent. I couldn’t make out the words, but they seemed to come from beyond the door. My hand trembled as I reached for the handle.

The second I touched it, the door flew open on its own.

Beyond it was a room that shouldn’t exist. It was massive, far larger than the foundation of the house would allow. The walls were covered in more of those strange carvings, glowing faintly in the dim light of the room. In the center was a table, and on it, an object that made my blood run cold.

It was a photograph.

Of me.

Not me as I am now, but a younger version of me, maybe eight or nine years old. I was sitting on the swing in our backyard, my face pale and frozen. I didn’t remember the photo being taken, but there was something haunting in my expression—a fear I couldn’t place.

Next to the photo was a journal. It was bound in cracked leather and looked ancient. Against my better judgment, I opened it. The handwriting inside was cramped and erratic, written in a language I didn’t recognize. But as I flipped through the pages, a few words began to make sense, as if the book wanted me to understand.

“Watcher.”
“Silence.”
“Door.”

My hands shook as I turned the pages. The final entry was different—written in English, in a child’s scrawl.

“They hurt me. They’re still here. If you’ve found this, you’re already too late.”

The whispers grew louder, turning into a cacophony of children's voices... and the sound of a singular child loudly sobbing could be heard above all of them. 

"It hurts stop! Stop you're hurting me! Stop it!" 

The sobbing grew louder, as if that was possible.

"It hurts!" The child cried.

I dropped the journal and backed away from the table. That’s when I noticed the shadows.

They were moving, shifting along the walls like living things. One of them stretched toward me, growing taller and darker. I turned and ran, my flashlight bouncing wildly as I bolted up the stairs.

"Please! Please stop!"

When I reached the hallway, the door slammed shut behind me. The house was silent again, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone.

Memories I’d long buried began surfacing in fragments—a hand on my shoulder, the locked bedroom door, muffled cries I pretended not to hear. This house had always held secrets, and I’d spent my life avoiding them.

But the door had brought them back.

Last night, I dreamed again.

This time, I was in the room. The whispers were deafening, and the shadows were everywhere, writhing like snakes. The journal was on the table, open to the final page.

The child’s handwriting had changed.

“Don’t run. You have to remember.”

I woke up gasping for air, my chest tight with fear. When I looked at the clock, it was exactly 3:33 a.m.

I don’t know what’s happening to me, but I can’t ignore it anymore. The door is still there, and something is waiting behind it.

It’s time to face it.
