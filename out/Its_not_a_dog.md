Last year, 23 at the time, I was grabbing a glass of water as the normal. As the tap ran the same flush as usual, i caught a glimpse of something moving outside. I live in a quiet area with a large stretched forest outside so I just assumed it was some sort of rodent. It wasn't. As I was about to turn back to the stairs, I felt a wave of anxiety fall over me and an urge to look outside. I tried shrugging this feeling off yet my gut told me to do otherwise. Once I turned, there was.. some sort of dog. At first I was confused as to why it was just sat there but as I began to walk away it sat up at speeds I wasn't capable of visibly seeing. Is hinged on its two hine legs with a smile revealing a grim, bloody tongue and teeth that resembled daggers. I immediately ran upstairs, locked myself in the bathroom and called my dad (he was trained to use guns and owns many.)
As I explained what happened between retched gasps for air, I heard glass shatter. 

It was inside.

I immediately hung up and held my hand over my mouth, biting down in attempt not to scream from fear. Then, I heard murmurs of what sounded like humanoid noises yet it was clearly not a human as inbetween words, there were screaches what I can only describe as murder-like. I sat, shaking and crying, praying to any god this.. thing.. would leave. After what felt like hours, I heard my dad  shouting my name and took this opportunity to jump out of the bathroom window, spraining my ankle and wrist. The police were then called and other then the glass shards, nothing was discovered. I soon moved in with a friend and swore I would never step near that house to this day. Last night however, as me and my friend were eating some takeaway and playing some PS4, I heard the same screach from that night. As me me my friend, Joel, looked out the window, a silloute which looked to be some sort of unworldly being hovered above the ground, glaring at us with its crimson red eyes. I immediately jaulted back knowing I had to hide yet Joel just stood there, as if he was in a trans. I tried grabbing his wrist to pull him back yet he slapped me off, still staring at the figure.
As time went by, he began to laugh maniacally and at that point I'd already given up helping him. He continued to do so but abruptly stopped. As I peaked through the doors keyhole, I saw not one, but two dogs sitting down with that same bloody grin the original had. I'm writing this in hope someone knows not only what's going on but also how to end this. They haven't seen me yet but it'll only be a matter of time.

Please. Help.
