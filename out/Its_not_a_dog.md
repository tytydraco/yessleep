November 28 2023, At 5:45 Am. I woke up to nothing but my dark & quiet room. I looked around feeling a somewhat unnerved feeling. “That was probably the strangest dream I’ve had in a long time” I think to myself as I sit up in bed, & look out my window. A bit relieved to see nothing but a few of my neighbor’s Christmas lights, & not whatever..That was. I replay the dream in my head while it’s still fresh in my mind.

I was in my front yard standing out on the patio, while my older sister was somewhere else in the yard out of view. I was just standing there looking out over the yard when out of literally nowhere. A random figure just walked out in front of me & they..Or it was wearing some kind of dog suit. A very uncanny, realistic dog suit. It looked like a very tall & very realistic white dog fur suit. But it moved unnaturally.

It didn’t seem to notice I was there, & if it did it chose to just not acknowledge me. I never really got a good look at its face which for some reason frightens me in a way i can’t explain..As it slowly walked past me I saw what appeared to be dirty blonde hair sticking out from the bottom of the white doglike head of the suit. Making it seem like there had to be a person in there. But something told me whatever was in that suit wasn’t human..If it even was a suit.

I just stood there & watched as the creature went over to one of the columns on the porch that held up the carport. & It started to attempt to climb it..This thing was for some unknown reason trying to climb onto the roof. This is what snapped me out of my trance & I called for my sister. I watched as she came running from wherever she was previously & without pause just grabbed the thing from behind, & then that’s where the dream ended & i woke up..I just sat there unable to get the image of whatever that thing was out of my mind, my head was full of questions without answers.

So I just attempted to forget about it, I calmed my brain down as much as I could, & decided to just go back to sleep hoping I wouldn’t remember any of it in the morning. But as soon as I laid back down to go back to sleep..I heard a soft but audible tap on the window. Then what sounds like a somewhat distorted canine like whine comes from the same direction outside my window..I feel eyes on me watching me intensely, as I’m obviously way too scared to look. & I don’t have to..It knows that I know it’s there. I don’t know what the fuck this thing is & I don’t really think I want to. But two things I do know about it is that it’s not human. & It is not. A dog.
