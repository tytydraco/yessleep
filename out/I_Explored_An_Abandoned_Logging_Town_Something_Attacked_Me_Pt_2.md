It seems like you all enjoyed my encounter at Elkmont,  you know it’s been eleven years since that night. Eleven years since I ran from something in th dark I still can’t fully explain. 

 

You’d think that after all this time, I’d have put it behind me. Moved on. Chalked it up to a combination of fear, exhaustion, and my own overactive imagination. But the thing is, I haven’t. I still think about it. More than I’d like to admit.  

 

And lately? Lately, I’ve had a reason to.  

 

I don’t know if you’ve heard, but people have been going missing near Elkmont again. Hikers. Campers. Not a lot, just enough for it to make the occasional headline. A couple vanishes here, a solo backpacker there. No bodies found. No signs of an animal attack. Just… gone.  

 

Most people blame the terrain—say they wandered off-trail, got turned around, maybe even fell into one of those old mine shafts hidden deep in the woods. But that’s not what gets me.  

 

What gets me is the reports from people who made it out. The ones who say they felt something watching them. That they heard whistling at night. That their radios and phones stopped working as soon as they got close to the old town.  

 

Sound familiar?  

 

Yeah. That’s why I haven’t been able to let it go. 

 

And I’m gonna be honest with you—I’ve been thinking about going back.  

 

Not alone this time. I know better than that. I was thinking of calling up Josh and his girlfriend, Trinity. They’ve always been into this kind of stuff, the weird and the unexplained. They’d be down for an adventure, no question. And maybe Justin and Hayden, too. Hell, even Justin’s sister, Haley—she’s always had more guts than the rest of us combined.  

 

A weekend trip to the woods. A chance to finally face whatever’s been gnawing at me for over a decade. To see if there’s really something out there, or if my mind has been playing tricks on me all these years. 

 

But the thing is, I don’t know if I’m hoping to prove myself wrong or right.  

 

Or if I’m hoping to find it again.

 

You ever notice how places in the Appalachian Mountains have a way of collecting stories? Like the land itself holds onto things—memories, whispers, shadows. Elkmont is one of those places.  

 

It’s been over a century since people really lived there, and yet, it never truly feels abandoned. Not the way it should. It’s not just an old logging town that got left behind when the industry dried up. There’s something about it, something older.  

 

I’ve been reading up on it recently. Trying to make sense of what happened. And the more I dig, the more I realize that Elkmont has always been strange.  

 

The Cherokee avoided the area long before settlers ever got there. Not because of bears, or rough terrain, or anything normal—but because they believed something lived there. Something that wasn’t human. Some stories say it was a spirit, something that could wear the skin of men and lure them into the woods. Others say it was worse, something that could take you, make you disappear without a trace.  

 

Then there’s the other stories. The ones from after settlers moved in. People disappearing without a sign. Hunters finding skinned deer hanging from the trees, like something had taken them but hadn’t bothered to eat them. Families reporting strange figures watching them from the tree line at dusk.  

 

And the whistling.  

 

That’s the part that keeps coming up. Over and over. 

 

Hikers today still report it—long, slow whistles echoing through the trees at night. Always the same pitch, the same tone. No birds, no insects, just that sound. Some people say it’s just the wind. Others say it’s a trick of the valley, sounds bouncing off the mountains.  

 

But I know better.  

 

I heard it. I heard it twice.  

 

I’m not saying I believe everything I’ve read. But the more I learn, the more I feel like I wasn’t just some dumb teenager who let the dark get the better of him that night.  

 

Something was out there. And the scariest part? It’s still there.  

 

The missing hikers prove that much.  

 

Which is why I can’t shake the idea of going back. 

 

Of getting a group together and seeing for myself—we could do it right this time. Camp out. Set up cameras, bring recording equipment, maybe even see if anything happens.  

 

I know how stupid it sounds. But after eleven years of feeling like I ran from something, I think it’s time I go back and face it. 

 

The only thing that keeps me up at night?  

 

What if it’s waiting for me?

 

 I’ll keep you all updated, I’m going to call my friends and see if they would even be interested in going with me and then if they are I’ll plan the trip from there…
