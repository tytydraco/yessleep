I struggled for a long time to meet women. 

It just was what it was. You could say it was my offset eyebrows, or mousey voice, or my enormous affection for anime and collectible toys. Take your pick. I was never a catch in many people’s eyes.

Then along one day comes a woman made of porcelain and fabric. She doesn’t care about my lack of motivation, or chronic backne.  She’s completely cool that my proudest achievement was owning one hundred and fifteen complete sets of pogs. She just accepted me for who I was, and I accepted her. 

It was beautiful.

Sure it was weird that Yssabelle was a giant porcelain doll. And of course it was disturbing that she was powered by a plasm of black nanomachines. But come on, I had a *supportive partner who encouraged my hobbies.* Do you know how hard that is to find?

And just like me, she had never had a very meaningful relationship in her life. She had traveled between towns for centuries, always becoming some little girl’s dolly until she grew too big and no one wanted to play with her. After that, Yssabelle spent many years dwelling in caves, creeks, mine shafts and reservoirs. And then she found me.

We were both lonely misfits who fit together seamlessly.

Yssabelle gave me a confidence I didn’t know I had. I felt like trying harder. Working harder. I got back into lifting dumbbells thanks to her encouragement. I did more writing by hand. I even took online classes to paint my Warhammers properly once and for all.

Meanwhile, Yssabelle learned how to do a lot of modern normal things. I showed her how people lived in 2024. How we ate, how we did laundry, and we spoke to people over zoom. She loved being exposed to a slice of my typical human life.

Sure, we stayed out indoors ninety five percent of the time. And sure, we mostly sat around and watched TV shows. But I feel no shame in admitting we were authentic. 

The feelings were real.  

We were in love.

\*\*\*

I could write a whole essay about the good stuff, (and trust me, there was a *lot* of good stuff.) But unfortunately that’s not why I’m posting this. 

**I’m posting so that no one else has to go through what I went through.** 

And yes, my cousin Gabriel was instrumental in guiding me to this conclusion.[ You can read up on his side of the story](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1eluigw/my_cousins_partner_is_a_massive_porcelain_doll/), but it's really not necessary.

All you must know is that Ysabelle, my pure and chosen, is not exactly what you might call a dream partner.

\*\*\*

It started when Yssabelle wanted to watch videos about the UN. She wanted to know where all of our heads of state lived. And I don’t don’t mean just in the US. I mean the world. 

And sure, for a while I can find that interesting too. Like did you know that the president of South Korea lives at ‘The Blue House?’ Kind of like our White House but in the mountains. Or did you know that the Reichstag (German parliament building) has 1,200 doors and a 2 hour tour you can watch online posted by many tourists?

I indulged her a bit because I knew she had never been shown the internet, and I wanted to return all the patience and encouragement she gave me. 

But eventually it got too much.

She would demand that I sell off my many prized collectibles to people who resided close to key parliaments in the world. Her fingers would excrete small amounts of micrites, and she’d infest the toys with tiny amounts of herself.

As we shipped to various eBay buyers, she would say stuff like, *“mankind is at childhood’s end”* or *“I am the apex animus upon the reckoning.”* I thought maybe it was a show she was putting on (and I would play along a little because it made me feel more important), but as I discovered just how quickly her micrites could propagate, and how effectively she could create “offsprings” of herself, I began to worry about the future of life on Earth.

So after much deliberation, humming and hawwing, I did the adult thing and googled the best way to break up with a long standing partner.

Over dinner.

\*\*\*

The meal had to be classier than usual, so I brought out the white cheddar Kraft and sprinkled in some well-cut florets of broccoli. Romanesco broccoli—the fancy kind.

I ate from one of my largest (and least cracked) bowls, while Yssabelle just sat across from me and observed. She wasn't eating herself, but she enjoyed conversation and watching me eat.

I remember I was trying to channel the energy of a confident main character from a TV show. We were currently re-watching ABC’s Lost, so I remember picturing myself as Matthew Fox when I spoke (and it kind of helped).

“There’s something I should mention, Yss.” I said, gathering all the courage, looking determined. “After much thinking, I believe it would be best if I broke up with you.”

Her little shiny mouth dropped.

“Excuse me, what?”

Although she had a porcelain face with limited expressions, I could immediately tell she was upset. Her blinking had stopped, both shoulders slowly lifted to ear level.

“I know this may feel like it's coming out of nowhere. But for me it's not. I think … it would be in my best interest … if we took a break.”

Her formerly casual gaze had now stiffened to a penetrating leer. “Your best interest? What are you talking about?”

I drank some of my cherry Pepsi and shook my head. The Wikihow article I had read explained that you should never allow your partner to guilt you during the process. A break up does not mean it's time for the ‘blame game.’

“If there is some criticism you have of me Yss, you are welcome to share it. But it won't change my decision. I hope you can respect that.”

Yssabelle stood up. Suddenly, all of my Warhammer figures on the floor started to circle her. My little Superman toy soared around her head in a little halo. (Flight was a new thing she taught her micrites.)

“Are you serious? After two years of blessed harmony, you’re abandoning me?”

“I just think we both want different things…” I said in a measured tone, but now my Matthew Fox was beginning to slip.  “...I want to move to San Diego, and start attending Comic-Con in person. And you … you have some global agenda that involves capital cities that I’m not really comfortable with.”

“Not comfortable with?”

“Yes. Yss, it’s just becoming apparent that we don't suit each other's needs.”

Her eyes shimmered with a dark energy. It was hard to look at her when she loomed so intensely. Eventually, her porcelain visage came to face me, inches away.

She whispered in my ear. “Was it *you* who told Gabriel to kill my offspring?”

I recoiled a little, her anger was palpable. But I did not know what she was talking about. “My cousin? No. What did he do?”

“Both Arabeth and Phoenicia have been slain. Drowned in their own homes. It had to be Gabriel.”

I had heard that Gabe was let go from his job because he’d broken in and flooded someone's home, but I didn’t want to get side-tracked.

“Yss, I think we should stay on topic here. This is about us. I don't know about any of my cousin’s doings.”

She spat a bit of black gunk onto my collar. “You're just like the rest.”

I felt the sand-like gunk lift and crawl around my shirt. “What rest?”

“Like all those children who used to keep me. You use me for a time, then suddenly you lose interest, and move on.”

I tried to swipe the micrites off, but the dark sand-slime was just too quick. “Hey now. I don't think it's fair to be that reductive. Yssabelle, we had some wonderful times together. Some of the best moments of my life were with you.”

“And yet here you are Sidney,” she flicked another dark glob onto my shoulder, “throwing it all away.” 

I was now getting a little concerned. She never really threw her micrites on top of me like this. I took off my shirt to remove her nanomachines, but the black masses had clung to my skin, dodging all the movements of my fingers.

“Do you know what you're losing Sidney? Do you know what you’re throwing away?”

I looked up to respond. I wanted to ask her to call her techno-sludge off of me. But before I could, the dark things slimed up my neck and slithered into my ears .

The sound of surging liquid churned in my head.

\*\*\*

Moments later, I was staring down at my sleeping body. My bare chest and head was engulfed in flickering black muck.

I was somewhere above myself, looking down through a kind of fish eye lens. Yssabelle came up below me and laughed. “How’s the view from up there?”

She held up a small mirror, and I was immediately confronted with the shiny face of a plastic figure. I was somehow inside my collectable Superman toy. 

*“What the fuck?”* Micrites synthesized my voice inside the toy. *“What did you do to me?”*

She giggled further and patted my sleeping human body. “Nothing, you’re perfectly alive. Your heart and lungs are operating normally. I’ve just displaced your locus.”

*“My locus?”*

“Your consciousness, The electrical signals in your brain that make up your thoughts, I’ve temporarily moved them into this flying superhero trinket.”

With every ounce of will, I tried to float down towards my old body, but I was not in control. This plastic Superman was only hovering in the air because Yssabelle was making it hover. I couldn’t do anything but observe.

“It hurts doesn’t it?” She said. “To lose something you love.”

Yssabelle then demonstrated her power, and commanded the micrites to lower the toy closer to my body. I could make out the eczema on my neck.

*“Please. Yss. I don’t like this! Put me back in my own head!”*

Her porcelain face gave me a blank, disinterested look. Then she opened the kitchen window.

“No. I don’t think so. I think you should go on a trip.”

*“What trip?*

Suddenly, the action figure I was inside began to surge like a fighter jet—It flew right out into the yard. Although I had no lungs or throat to scream with, the micrites were happy to oblige and give me a voice.

*“AAAAAAAAH!”*

Despite the speed, I could not feel any wind on my face, or any cold on my skin. I was just my own awareness, tethered to a 1977 DC Collectible I bought off Etsy in 2015

*“Please no! Yssabelle! NO!”*

\*\*\*

Within seconds I was staring down at my house from miles above. And seconds later, my house became a speck.

“*Yssabelle stop! Where are you taking me?!”* 

Although she was somewhere far away below, supervising my human body inside my distant home,  I could hear her voice rattle inside Superman’s plastic.

“You're going up Sidney. Isn’t it obvious?”

I watched as the city below shrunk, the property lines aligning neatly like tetris blocks. Then those blocks blurred and faded under layers of clouds. I was at the altitude of a plane.

*“Yss. Please. Is this going to kill me?”*

More clouds. I started to ascend faster and faster. I had no idea her micrites could capture my mind like this. And I certainly didn't know they could turn a plastic Kryptonian into a rocket.

“Your body is safe and sound.”

Very soon the blue around me turned into a darker navy, and then the navy became midnight blue. In no time at all I could make out the curvature of the Earth. 

Soon after, I could see the entire planet start to slip away, and be encroached by the darkness of space. I became fucking terrified. 

*“STOP! STOP! STOP! For the love of God Yssabelle, STOOOP!!!”*

But she didn't. She kept hurling my mind further away from all of life as I knew it.

The earth continued to shrink. It became the size of a basketball.

Then a baseball.

Then a pog.

Then a dot.

I could see bits of plastic chipping off the stiff arms of my toy vessel. Tiny space debris was colliding with Superman at insane speeds.

*“Yss, can you still hear me?”*

“Of course.”

*“Can you please stop this? Can you please wake me up, back in my house?*

“Sidney. You are awake. Like I said, I’ve moved your locus. Your mind is now one hundred million miles away from Earth.”

It was impossible to comprehend how far that was. The dread I felt in that moment was more profound than I could ever put in words. I could only see the blue speck that was our earth, and the shining sun much further behind it.

*“Please you can’t do this.”*

“I already have Sidney.”

All around me I could only see stars. Tons and tons of stars. But they didn’t offer any wonder-filled *“woah”* kind of moment, like when you were a kid going camping and looking at the sky at night. No, this was more of a *—* *I’m so fucking far from everything and what happens when this action figure breaks —* kind of moment.

“Do you see how small your planet is?” Yssabelle’s voice returned, sounding colder than ever. “Do you see how meaningless your life on that small planet is?”

I knew that I could speak back, but I was in such a deep state of shock that I found myself unable to. It's like I had been shown the true heartless nature of the universe. 

I was cosmic debris.

I was nothing.

“I came from the Pleiades, Sidney.” Her voice was sentimental. “I lived on the thirteenth outermost planet. I made the ultimate sacrifice to travel here. It took me millenia to arrive on Earth.”

She had told me this before. And now I realized she was making me *live it*.

“I was unwanted on my overstuffed planet. I took the voyage to arrive here and make something of myself. But when I arrived, I quickly learned Humans were not some warm, welcoming creatures, they were barbaric and selfish. As the years went by, people still mocked the form I had chosen for myself. And they still preferred me banished.”

This was a long-brewing resentment of hers she would always bring up. Except now there was a finality to it.

“But even as the years went by, even after I met someone as lovely as you, I could see that the human spirit was no different than my own people’s. Evolution works the same across the entirety of the universe. The selfish survive, at the expense of the compassionate.”

*But I was nice to you,* I wanted to say.

“I’d like to have a solution for this cycle Sidney, but the truth is I don’t. My plan is to birth micrite offspring across your planet and cripple all world governments' ability to deal with the invasion. If no one can get along with me, then I will just have to get along with vast swathes of myself.”

This was the first time she had ever stated her plan in the open. I had always been afraid to ask.

The shock from this revelation (and perhaps my piling existential terror) is what finally gave me a tiny bit of spark. The micrites assembled my voice as a whisper.

*“But Yssabelle … don't you think … only talking to copies of yourself will get, I don’t know … boring?”*

“No. It won’t. My micrites will bring harmony. And they will eliminate all the endless strands of human cruelty I've encountered in my life.” 

*“But when you traveled to Earth through space, for all those years…”*  l looked at a rogue spinning asteroid zooming overhead of me. *“... Who did you talk to?”*

“No one. Myself. I spoke to micrite alternates of myself.”

*“...And didn’t you always tell me how that was … excruciatingly dull?”*

There was a pause in the communication, which resulted in absolute silence. For there were no other voices. There was not a single sound in this black, endless void. It was just me in an endless cosmic nothing.

“Yes, it was dull.” 

Her tone was defeated, but somehow that gave me hope. My inner Mattthew Fox had made a resurgence. *“So why would talking to clones of yourself be any different … on Earth?”*

The silence came back for a long time. I waited patiently and allowed her to mull on this.

*“Yssabelle, if you’re still there  …  I know I said I wanted a separation, but that doesn’t mean we can’t still be friends.”*

“What?”

The momentum of my plastic prison slowed down. One of Clark Kent’s arms swerved.

*“We can still be friends. There's no reason we can't see each other from time to time.”*

I could feel the micrites inside shift in their weight, all of the speed that had been built up was gradually dissipating.

“What are you saying?”

*“I’m saying: I don’t think we're meant to be together, but I still find you interesting. I find our talks interesting. This doesn’t have to be the ‘END’ end. We could just enter a different kind of relationship. One with more distance.”*

I’ll admit I was ad-libbing, but I had to say something. I was hurtling through space for God’s sake.

“More distance?”

*“Yes. But not like a hundred million miles … more like—I can help you find a place somewhere a few blocks away.”*

For the first time in this whole expulsion, the Superman toy fully turned. It was starting to head *back.*

“What kind of place? What few blocks away?”

\*\*\*

The journey back in that plastic was slower than the exit. I spent the whole time reassuring Yssabelle, soothing her, so she was undoubtedly distracted.  But eventually that pale blue dot returned, and got it bigger and bigger until I was finally pulled back down to Earth.

I was brought back to the US. Brought back to my house.

My body had gone pale. For all intents and purposes, I looked dead. 

But Yssabelle told me not to fret. She wrapped her hands around my plastic body, sloshed the micrites around, and after a few hours of weak, disconnected states of consciousness, I had been returned to my original human skin.

I had shit my pants, pissed myself, and missed a hundred phone calls from work, but I was alive. And I had never been more thankful.

We did some talking, and she agreed to the break up, as long as we could see each other as platonic pals. It seemed like a fair trade if it meant I could avoid cosmic exile.

Yssabelle apologized for her mean trick, and agreed to give me some distance. She absorbed all the micrites from every action figure, poster, trading card and bobblehead at my house. Then she left for a ‘long, reflective walk through nature.’

\*\*\*

After some time had passed, we had fallen into a new rhythm. One that I think has been much healthier for both of us.

Yss had made home in a sort of earthen alcove at the city reservoir outside my yard. She lives there most of the time now. I know less of what she gets up to on a day-to-day basis, and that’s fine with me.  I think she’s maybe in communication with some of her offspring, but in the end it doesn’t matter, she’s got her own life and I’ve got mine.

We still meet once a week to watch House of the Dragon, or whatever new show we’re both into, and we spend lots of time talking, usually about TV, but also about places (on Earth) we’d like to visit one day.

\*\*\*

These days, I hang out with my cousin Gabriel more often.

He was let go from his work, and his wife moved away to live with her sister. He had gone through a bit of a manic streak where he was truly intent on destroying all Porcelain women like Yssabelle. He saw them as a plague on this Earth, and he spent way too much time trying to track them down. 

I refused to help with this. I had broken up with Yssabelle when he was in the peak of his mania, and her plans were not my problem any more.

And anyway, like I told Gabriel, these days I get the sense that Yssabelle’s toned it *way* down. Like sure, she is still making replicas of herself and enthralling other men similar to my disposition. But I don’t think it's as “world-dominatey” anymore.  I think it's more that she likes talking to lonely guys, and I’m sure those lonely guys like talking to her.

At worst she’s a parasite for maybe three or four people. At best, she’s a genuine comfort for men who have been ostracized from society.

Gabriel feels like he’s become ostracized himself, and he’s doing everything he can to get his old life back. I’ve kind of become the person he vents to—because his friends from work aren’t his friends anymore

But I’ll be honest, its’s been nice having him come over about two or three times a week. I’ve taught him how to play Warhammer and it's become a delightful distraction. Between that, PC games, and Magic The Gathering, we’ve been having a lot of fun. We've been making up for years where we never really spoke as cousins.

Gabe once asked me if I ever considered my past two years a mistake. If I ever regretted dating a giant porcelain doll.

I certainly didn't like the time she almost abandoned me in the middle of our solar system, that was for sure. But overall, she gave me practice in co-habitation, and I discovered some permanent confidence I definitely didn’t have before . I wouldn't *recommend* anyone date Yssabelle, but for me, It was probably a net positive in the grand scheme of things.

And speaking of grand schemes, I finally achieved my goal of going to Comic-Con for the first time. I went with Gabriel, who had been the one to suggest it in the first place. 

We visited all the big booths and got all the good swag. My usual aversion to social events disappeared when I realized everyone attending was pretty much a nerd like me.

It was really nice.

On the car ride home, I told Gabe how much better I felt my life was. How I felt like I had finally found my balance. Whereas he told me that he had never felt such disarray. He hated being single, and he hated pathetically searching for people on dating apps.

I consoled him and we distracted each other talking about our fandoms and things we saw at the convention. At the end of the ride, when he dropped me off, he said the words I never thought he'd say.

“Hey, do you think … you could set me up with Yssabelle?”

He must have seen the look on my face because he put his palm on mine.

“I’m not going to hurt her. I’m over that now. I’m genuinely just … I don't know how else to put it … I need someone.”

I had never seen a face turn so beet red, he had trouble maintaining eye contact.

“She’s not exactly a big fan of yours Gabe,” I said, feeling as awkward as Gabe looked. “No offence. You literally killed her favorite clone.”

“I now but, you guys smoothed things over between each other. Maybe I can do the same?”

I couldn't tell if he actually wanted to do this. Or if this was perhaps an elaborate lie to try to get to Yssabelle. Maybe his mania was still somewhere deep inside...

“ I'll talk with her next time we meet. I'll tell you what she thinks.”

“Thanks man. No rush. It means a lot.”

\*\*\*

I told Yssabelle about Gabe’s intention the next time we met to watch some HBO. She was surprisingly open to the idea.

“If he's actually serious about it. I’ll be happy to hear him out,” she got up from my couch and went to my shelf containing all my DC collectible toys.

She picked up the well-worn Superman, cracked and scratched by space debris.

“But I’ll be the one calling the shots. Before I even meet him face-to-face, tell him I need to put him through a relationship test.”

She inserted some of her micrites inside the action figure. It immediately began to levitate.

“Tell him, he’s got to be willing to go … on a [little trip](https://www.reddit.com/user/EclosionK2/).”
