Sometimes, at night, I can feel my mattress breathing.

I know how that sounds. Like some sleep paralysis thing, or maybe a rodent problem, but I swear it's **real**—and it's not fucking squirrels burrowing into my Tempur-Pedic. I've checked. I even unzipped the bottom cover with a flashlight once and nearly cried from relief when I saw nothing. But that was weeks ago. Things have changed.

Let’s go back to the beginning—when I first thought I was going insane.

It was a regular Saturday night. I’m a boring person. I had a glass of high-percentage wine and a horror novel. The wine makes it more immersive—numbs you just enough to let the story crawl in a bit deeper. The book was nothing groundbreaking: classic "someone’s living in your attic" type of deal. I was finding it kind of dull, honestly.

The wine tasted sharp, almost metallic. I winced every time I swallowed. Didn’t stop me though. I don’t drink for the taste.

I closed my balcony door, did the usual hygiene stuff, and got into bed on freshly washed sheets. I’d changed them out of guilt after reading some article about how often you’re *supposed* to wash them. (Spoiler: way more than I do.)

Most importantly—there was nothing weird. Nothing lurking. Nothing strange about the mattress, the room, the night.

I fell asleep easily.

Then the movements started.

At first, I thought I was dreaming. You know that slow, sloshy feeling when you roll onto a bad mattress? It was like that. Except it didn’t stop. It kept going—rhythmic, slow, like a heartbeat. I remember lying there, eyes closed, thinking, *is this what a waterbed feels like?* Except I don’t own a waterbed.

I brought it up to my doctor. She chalked it up to hypnagogic hallucinations. “Nighttime creepies,” she said. Gave me something to help me sleep.

The meds made it worse.

Because now, when it happens, I can’t move. I lie there, fully aware, completely paralyzed, while the mattress shifts underneath me—pulsing slow and deep, like something alive is nestled inside and trying to sync its breathing with mine.

I started calling them “episodes.” It made me feel more in control. Like if I gave it a name, I could study it, track it. Talk about it without sounding completely unhinged. But now I just sound like a lunatic when I say things like, *“The episode started at 2:13 AM and lasted fourteen minutes.”*

I tried sleeping on the couch. Still woke up with that feeling, that *presence*, like something knew I wasn’t where I was supposed to be. I tried staying in a hotel once—nothing happened that night, but I had the strangest dream that something was waiting at home. *Lonely.*

And last night…

Last night, I swear it pulled me down. Not physically. Emotionally. Like I was disappointing it. Like it missed me.

I don’t think it’s a hallucination anymore.

I think my mattress is alive.

And I think it doesn’t want me to leave.
