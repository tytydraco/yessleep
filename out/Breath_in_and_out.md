Surgery is an act of precision, steady hands and pure steel blades both instruments for purpose, my mind itself a tool. I stand above my work: feet, legs, spine, locked but fluid in position, unnecessary movement alien. The shaved scalp rests below me. I call for an instrument – the name foreign in my daze – grasp it deftly between my index and thumb and raise it to the exposed skin. Equal measures of panic and fear mire my thoughts for only a second: once the skin is pierced, a frigid calm passes through me. The hand guides the blade forward. I grit my teeth only in my mind and increase my pace: peeling away the outer skin, cutting away sections of bone. Hands operate with frightening speed, accuracy – inhuman, as I barely think to control them – pinning back the dura mater and resting the scalpel near the nurse, who nods, crinkled eyes disclosing the encouraging smile beneath her mask. I do not let myself rest. 

I do not let myself breathe. Resting before me, gloating in its vile, clotted gore, lays the medulloblastoma. I stare, aghast. Its gaze penetrates me wholly, its existence mirrored in my head, a twin cancer nestled within my mind. I push the thoughts away. I cannot allow myself to be swayed by my mortality: in this moment, I must be a machine – mechanical, cool, precise. I fall into autopilot.

In my thoughts the tumour beats akin to a heart; each foul tremor off-put against the rhythmic beat of my work, sending dense ripples, interrupted by the brain’s ridges, through the blood. The scalpel steadies. Hands move to excise the tumour, paying no attention to the violent tremors plaguing my thoughts, to its monstrous movement as it wrings itself in, out. Like a mother’s washcloth, soaked with sanguine fluid. In, out. I feel the tremors, shaking – interrupting – my thoughts, a ragdoll in the hands of a child. In, out. My vision clouds, hands fading from view as they sustain their pace; severing tumour from flesh, disease from health, tracing the thin line between saviour and killer. In. Out. The blood, a deep, dirty red, bathes my vision, suffocating me in its pollution. In. Out. In – 

The operation succeeds.

The patient’s chest rises out, then in. Soft breaths escape her open mouth, her eyelids fluttering as her anaesthesia wears off. An image of her tumour beats in my mind, a deep, tainted red. I see hands moving to hold hers, small in my palms, comforting her as she awakes. I barely acknowledge parents rushing past the curtain, cupping her frail face within their hands, grasping her as if she might disappear. They turn towards me, faces stained by the tumour’s haunting afterimage. They clutch extended hands, shaking me energetically in their gratefulness. I smile, the grin not reaching my eyes. The red tint of blood encompasses my vision. 

‘Doctor!’ A voice cries from the cafeteria’s corner, ‘I heard the surgery went well, how is the patient?’ 

Hands – mine – raise and wave the figure over. I shudder with relief, looking away from my bowl. The figure sits, chattering incessantly. Food trays clang as they are laid to rest on the cold metal table. From minutes of fragmented conversation, I gather polyps of information; they are an intern at their dream location, they are so grateful to discuss my work, they hope I can consider putting in a good word for them. Hands move again as I talk without thought, words escaping without my recognition. I resign myself to my mind, glad for the distraction. The intern chatters on.

‘...I was so nervous in the interview, you know? You’re so young, you must’ve had the same application process. Can you give me any tips?’ They speak.
‘You haven’t touched your lunch – do you not like the food? I love the açai bowls…’

I stare down at my tray. Writhing within the confines of the bowl rests the tumour, staining the surrounding air a sickly red. Each beat vibrates the ceramic, rippling the dark, clotted liquid within. In, Out. The mass seems gloating, aware and proud of the anguish it causes me. I hear myself offer a half-hearted excuse before rising. As my feet carry me to the doors, I spare a glance back. The intern sits at the table, spooning curdling masses of blastoma into their mouth, cheeks expanding as the tumour beats. In. Out. 

Faces blur through my thoughts as feet carry me to my office, silhouettes smeared as ugly red strokes. I pass doors ajar in the halls, each sight a glimpse into the lives of others: the happiest moments, a mother holding her infant in her embrace, and the most wretched: a woman grasping the limp hand of a sickly child as she sobs. The figures twist within the darkness of my thoughts, disfiguring and contorting to resemble grotesque, monstrous Dalí works. Superimposed upon these scenes, baroque in their dramatism, rests the tumour. It floats above beds, bathing the rooms in flickering light that seeps through the thin curtains. It rests on the chest of patients, leaking fluid through their gowns, and hides beneath hospital beds until they are rolled out, gloating at the embossed ‘time of deaths’. In all, it beats. A horrid, oppressing tune; the marching feet of an army ten thousand strong, the beating bass of a concert’s front row. It must’ve grown louder, as it permeates my thoughts completely now, each string interrupted by the bassy percussion. In. Out. 

In – finally! Hands press open the glossy door of my office, ignoring my frantic thoughts. Legs carry me to my desk, resting me atop my chair. I sink into the soft fabric, grateful for the respite. Eyes glance around the room and my thoughts steady. The office is bathed in a clean, blue light: clinical and pure, devoid of the tumour's influence. A sign of relief is breathed, mirrored in my thoughts. This space – the calm, tranquil surroundings, blocked away from the hospital – allows me to breathe, to attempt to regain control over my senses. I glance to my desktop, observing the calendar.

Shift End: 5:00pm.
 
Time: 4:45pm. 

I allow my eyelids to become heavy, resting my full weight into the plush chair. Just a small break, I tell myself. Most of the paperwork is completed: the documents signed, the release forms read. I allow myself to rest. In this office, I am safe: from my work, from the diagnosis, from the tumour. 

I allow myself to breathe. In. Out.

I tell myself to move the tips of my fingers; after some resistance, they comply with my thoughts. I build up the movements, tracing a routine track as I work on first twitching, then flexing, each part of my body. It is as if I am relearning to occupy it, like a quadriplegic after an accident. The motions are traced into my mind, engraved after countless hours of work, countless balances of life and death. When tracing the line between saviour and killer, could I afford to trust myself? Even more so now; when I host my enemy within me, can I ensure my actions are my own?

I breathe again, forgetting my work for a moment.

In. Out.

I feel my trachea carry fresh air to my lungs, focusing on each motion, each movement of skin and tendon, diaphragm and sinus.

In. Out.

I feel my head clear, the remnants of the tumour’s dark amber dripping away from my mind’s ridges.

In. Out.

I barely hear the hinges screeching as my door is flung open.

‘Doctor!’

I jolt in my seat, the plush hands of the upholstering holding me down. 

‘Your patient –’

My hands begin to tense.

‘Aneurysm .. emergency surgery –’

I sink into my chair, the warm, fleshy skin of the tumour cradling me. Ears hear the language of the visitor, foreign in my thoughts. Hands grasp the slippery arms of the tumour, pushing a body from the surface. Legs carry my thoughts from my office, crying out to return. As the door is closed, the tumour envelopes my thoughts again. Barely aware of the hallway, I envision shadowed, flitting shapes travelling past me, my thoughts a bubble in the murk. The dark of the tumour seeps in, the oppressing thump of its heart overpowering my thoughts. 

In. Out.

Legs carry my limp thoughts to the operating theatre, weaving an intense pace through the figures in the hall.

In. Out.

Arms pull on a surgical coat, fastening it with acute precision.

In. Out.

Hands grasp a scalpel, readying it perpendicular to the point of incision. 
The body tenses, locked but fluid. 
The nurse smiles, offering encouragement.

The blade pierces the skin.
The tumour beats.

In. Out.

I am trapped within my thoughts. I press against the borders set by my mind, desperately trying to escape the thump-thump-thump of the tumour. It reverberates through my being. I try to move a finger, a toe: flex my ears or my nose, command my body to do anything, to escape the failsafes I set.  The tumour sets my thoughts alight with its red tint: each beat an army besieging the city of my thoughts. I scream, drowned out. I try again, the pain of the noise too much to bear. I beg for any release, any suspension of the oppressive beating. It is as if I am the one on the table, my anaesthesia defective. I feel every incision as if my own, punctuated by the tumour.

Hands continue the surgery, excising the bone.

The tumour drowns my vision, coating each thought a vile red. 

Hands peel back the dura mater.

I gaze upon the brain, bathing in its vulnerability. It mirrors my thoughts. Ridges of smooth, pink flesh, dunes of undulating vessels rest infected by the tumour. Lodged into every crevice, every trough of the waves, nestles the beating, cancerous flesh. It glares at my thoughts, mocking me, gloating. I see my own shade of red, bright against the dark tint of the tumour.

My thoughts escape.

I feel my hands, my feet, my legs, my spine. My vision becomes my own and I rejoice. My legs weaken, shocked by their changed owner. I stumble, scalpel dragging through the infected flesh. The tumour recedes at the touch, masses curving away from the blade like a red sea. Catching myself, I claw at the mass as if a beast, stabbing the blade crudely through the beating aberration. Each hack causes the tumour to retreat, each millimetre it moves exposing more infected brain, each victory won opening further conflicts. I barely recognise the burning pain I feel as I mutilate the tissue, each mirrored blow softened by my animalistic state. Relief washes over me, mixing with the dark blood of the patient’s tumour, driving the drops down my body, cleansing me of the diagnosis. A melancholy, dim hope fills me, every inch I excise removing itself from my mind. My arms burn at the exertion, tense muscles protesting every movement. I trace existing lacerations, trenches growing larger with each attack. The scalpel is wrested from my hands and I push the nurse back, returning to my frenzy. My hands claw at the brain until my gloves rip, scraping the tumour with my nails. The meat feels soft and fatty beneath my fingernails, deforming under my frantic touch. I discard the butchered flesh – casting it out of the skull – excising every last lesion from the clear, ivory bone, strips of bleeding, mutilated flesh coating my nail beds. Hands pull at my surgical coat, and I push them back, moving in the same motion to scoop the now-milky, viscous remains of the brain and tumour from the skull. My own brain feels liquid, mirroring the tumour’s state. I see red, a bright, violent red, drowning out the vile beating of the tumour. My lungs rise in, then out. 

In. Out.

I see black, flowing in from the corners of my vision.

The beating stops.
