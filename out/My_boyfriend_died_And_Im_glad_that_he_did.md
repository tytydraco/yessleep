It all started one fateful Tuesday morning. We had just gotten our usual coffees from our favourite independent cafe, and we were talking in the car about our plans for the upcoming Christmas break. My boyfriend Peter was driving while I was balancing our beverages on my lap in those to-go containers made from recycled cardboard.

We were talking about how his mother would react to his sisters new hair colour, which was a vibrant blue and changed as often as the weather, when all of a sudden his head slowly started turning towards me with the biggest most horrifying grin I’ve ever seen. I was frozen in shock just watching him. “Peter?” I ask, waving a hand in front of his face. He doesn’t reply, only staring at me with that eerie grin, never blinking, never moving. The lights that we were waiting at had turned green, and other cars behind us  had started honking in anticipation and frustration.

All of a sudden, Peter seemed to snap back into reality and proceeded to drive through the lights, as if nothing happened. I look at him in awe and can only muster up the words “are you okay? What happened there?” He looks at me blankly as if I was a lunatic. “What do you mean?” I disregard it, as he has a habit of playing pranks on me. “Haha very funny.” I say sarcastically as I roll my eyes. He starts to talk about which hair colour he predicts Greta will get next (probably purple, as she has a clear favourite of cool toned colours) and I seem to relax. 

Silly Peter, always playing tricks on me. 

The next time it happened was two weeks later, on a cosy date night which consisted of us cuddling up on the couch watching some Disney movie, while having some wine and snacks. I paused Moana as she was about to jump into the monster realm at the top of the massive rock-portal thing and asked Peter if he wanted some popcorn. He said yes and so I was rummaging around in our cabinet when I got the spine-chilling feeling I was being watched.

I finally found the popcorn which was hiding at the back behind the cans of tuna, and turn around to lock eyes with my boyfriend of three and a half years staring straight into my soul. His eyes seemed to be bulging out of their sockets, and his mouth seemed to reach from ear to ear as he grinned at me not saying anything,not moving anything, just staring at me in deathly still silence.

I was shocked that it happened again, and immediately I just froze up. It must be part of my fight/flight instinct or something, as the last time it happened I couldn’t move either. I slowly reached for the biggest knife I could see sitting in the knife block on the kitchen countertop. My hands were shaking so much I could barely take the knife out of its place. I never broke eye contact with Peter, in fear that something would happen. 

All of a sudden, the doorbell rang. Who could be ringing the doorbell at 9pm on a Sunday night? I maintained eye contact with Peter, whose spell seemed to be broken as he gave me a funny look and pulled the blanket over his body, so only his head was poking out. I used this opportunity to quickly speed-walk towards the door, and as it swung open, I breathed a sigh of relief. I had always been close with Greta, even if there were 15 years between us. Peter’s sister tilted her head to the side, as if confused, and asked if I was okay. I wiped the beads of sweat from my forehead and exclaimed “Please let me stay with you!” She looked at me with .. pity? “Of course you can, you’re welcome anytime at my house. Is everything okay in there? How’s Peter?” 

He must’ve been listening because he took that opportunity to saunter towards the door. “Hello my favourite sister, how are you and how may we help you?” Her eyes darted between us two, noticing how I was flinching every time he spoke. To me, his words were daggers piercing through my skin. “I’m good, are you ready for our girls sleepover Emma?” I suddenly noticed that I was still holding the humongous knife, as I sheepishly looked at her, and replied hastily “yes, yes let me grab my bag.” I gave her a polite nod, and ducked inside.

After placing the knife back into the knife holder, I dashed upstairs and started grabbing whatever I saw and shoving it into an overnight bag. I sprinted downstairs and waved goodbye to Peter from a distance, as I was still shell-shocked from the whole ordeal. As soon as Greta and I shut the car doors in her lime green Honda accord, she looked at me expectantly. “Spill.” I explained what had happened two weeks ago, and how the same thing had happened just ten minutes ago, but somehow this time was worst than the last. As we entered her driveway, she looked at me and said “you can stay here as long as you want, you’re safe here.” As much as I wanted to believe that that was true, deep down I knew that he could find me if he wanted, as he could track my phone. 

Three days I spent worrying and hiding in Greta’s two bedroom bungalow, peering out the windows and biting my nails in anticipation and fear. Finally, on the third night, it happened.
I had a dream of Peter standing in our driveway, his eyeballs bloodshot and practically popping out of his head, his grin staring from one ear to the other, although this time, something was different. He had shreds of what looked like meat of some kind stuck in his blood stained teeth, which had seemed to turn razor-sharp, and he was chanting ever so softly, “comehomeemmacomehomeemma.” I woke up screaming and immediately burst into tears but I knew in my heart that it was time to go home. 

Reluctantly, Greta pulled up in the parking spot next to my house, and even though it was broad daylight, my palms became sweaty and my blood ran cold. Grabbing Greta’s hand, we cautiously approached the house. The front door was wide open, and all of the windows had been broken. “Peter?” I called out. My eyes darted to the kitchen but all of our knives were nowhere to be seen. Shit. Room by room, Greta and I covered all of them downstairs but Peter was no where to be found. All of a sudden, I heard a faint creaking noise from upstairs. It was that one floorboard in our bedroom, which no matter which way you went it always made a sound. 

Bravely clutching her car keys, Greta led the way upstairs. On edge, we paused, standing in front of the closed bedroom door. Greta mouthed three, two, one and swung the door open. Peter was nowhere in sight. We looked at each other in confusion and I bravely stepped into the room. Greta followed me and I turn around to look at her. My gaze immediately goes to that space that was in between the door and the wall. That occupied space. Before I can even form words with my mouth, that horrible - creature whom I couldn’t even call my boyfriend anymore, leaps towards Greta and plunges that very same kitchen knife I was holding four days ago into the back of her head. After several seconds which felt like hours, Greta’s body slumps to the floor, the red blood mixed with her blue hair to create purple. Peter was right after all.

After chilling silence, this thing, grinning as wide as it can, whispers “welcome home emma.” 
Something snaps in me as I lunge towards the knife in lighting speed, swiftly grabbing it and something takes over me as I start stabbing blindly into the man which I used to love. The whole time, Peter is giggling manically as the knife enters his body. Finally, he stops and the chilling silence takes over. I realise what I have just done. 

I am sitting here, writing to you after moving to another city, at least an hour drive from where these events took place. I am glad my boyfriend died, but I am not so sure that his sister did, otherwise who would be pounding on my door screaming my name?
