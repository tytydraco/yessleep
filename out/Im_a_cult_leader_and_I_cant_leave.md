“In the name of the nameless, I banish thee from this world.” Uttering the mantra for what felt like the millionth time, I plunged the marrow dagger deep into the writhing man’s heart. It was quick, and, I secretly hoped, as painless as possible. My expression, however, remained as stoic as I could make it. A thick black hood covered most of my face, and it would have been difficult to read my face anyway, but I couldn’t take any chances. I watched silently as the man’s form stopped moving entirely, the dagger sticking out of his chest with a small pool of red forming around it. After a few moments of silence, I raised my hands slowly above the corpse, vaguely gesturing toward the crowd.

  


“You are dismissed from the assembly. Go in peace in the name of the nameless.” I held my hands out, palms facing up to the sky, symbolically ending the ritual. Slowly but surely, the 20 or so figures, all dressed in matching ceremonial robes, tapered off. Some started up the winding stone path deeper into the forest, some turned down to the lush coast, a few stayed to engage in conversation far enough away that I couldn’t make out what was said. 

  


I simply turned and started for the cave. The island has many of them, but only one where I knew I wouldn’t be disturbed. Especially when talking to *him*.

  


And shortly after the ritual, *he* decided to pay me a visit, as if the constant guilt and shame wasn’t enough torture. 

  


I wish I could tell you what he looks like, if you could even call it a he. It looks…human, or at least the shape does. He doesn’t have any features; just a vaguely humanoid blackness. No, that doesn’t do it justice. That makes him sound like a shadow, or a fragment of space. No, he is the *absence* of being, the absence of color and identity and light. His mere presence is a defiance of life, a mockery. The air around his form is folded, like a nightmarish perversion of our Euclidean reality.

  


Sitting cross legged against the hard, damp floor of a cave well enough isolated from anyone else, I heard him approach before he spoke. It sounded grotesque, like the sound of scissors cutting through paper, only way more visceral. Like the very air was tearing itself open to make room for him. 



Swallowing my nerves, I turned to face him.

  


“What is it?” I’m not sure if I was trying to be intimidating or just nonchalant, but either way I remained breathing. With him, that was as good a sign as any.

  


“Thou hast been stalling.” His voice, deep and layered, pierced uncomfortably into my skull. It wasn’t an accusation, just a matter-of-fact statement. He didn’t need to accuse. “Why have thine sacrifices dwindled of late?”

  


*He knows. Of course he knows.* I didn’t say anything for a few agonizing seconds, just stood there. I probably looked as foolish and exposed as I felt. In the absence of my response, he took a step closer and continued.

  


“Doth thou need a reminder of our deal?” As he said this, I felt bile burn my throat. “Thy wife and child’s return from death, in exchange for 517 souls given unto me - killed, by thine own hand.”

  


“Right,” I mustered. "Of course.” I don’t know if I convinced him or not; he just stared into my eyes for several uncomfortable moments. “But…why 517 specifically? Why not just make me kill 2 people? One for each life returned?” As I spoke the words, I couldn’t quench the guilt that enveloped me. I would have much preferred no death at all, but the guilt was also accompanied by a sense of purpose. I was doing this for my family. For the promise of it, at least.

  


He chuckled. It sounded like sandpaper being rubbed across a nail filer.

  


“More souls are needed to power the Wheel.”

  


I tried not to let confusion show on my face, but likely did a bad job at it. “A…wheel?”

  


“Hmmmm……” 

  


Its pensive noise stretched into a slow, hearty chuckle. It looked me over again before it spoke:

  


“Knew I when we met, there is something within thee. Thy hands and thy soul both drip red.” He ignored my question completely. I’m not sure if that’s what caused my fear level to spike dramatically.

  


“Thy wit and skill hath served thee well. Long have I roamed this plane beyond, searching for one such as thee, one who hath carved the land itself with the blood of the damn’d.” He took a short pause, as though needing to remind himself to breathe. “And a part of thee enjoys it,” he said. “Thou hath never before felt so alive.”

  


I stared down at the cavern floor. Light from the entrance lazily danced along the rock, somewhat soothing in spite of what was happening. It didn’t, however, make the words come any easier.

  


“I don’t…ah…well I mean I–”

  


He interrupted with an almost haughty chuckle. If he were human, it might have even sounded condescending. As quiet as it was, the acoustics of the cave drilled the sound into my head, mocking me.

  


“Continue thy work. The Wheel shall spin, and thou shalt witness thy folly.”

  


Before I could blink, he…I’m not sure how to describe it…*folded* into himself, his form retreating within itself like a whirlpool, and he was gone. The space around where his form had stood seemed to ripple for a few moments before settling into nothing.

  


I’m not sure why I’m even writing this. Frankly, I don’t think there’s much to be done, for myself or for the other poor souls here on the island. If there were any other way, I’d jump at it in a heartbeat, but this is who I have to be. I’ve been slow, trying to buy as much time as I can, trying to postpone killing as much as possible. Trying to convince myself that I’m somehow still a good person, really.

  


I don’t have a choice. I’m indebted to *him*. And when I’ve done what he asked, when I’ve given him all the souls he requires…I can only hope that his plans no longer involve me or my family.
