I'm not surprised if no one shares the same memories as I do and I rightfully  understand so. Port Martin is a city that is completely overshadowed by the neighboring cities of Galveston and Beaumont, especially when it comes to success in oil. 

I thought it would be appropriate to post here because this distinct memory I can recall from my childhood has what I believe to is quite a campfire story element to it, although it may just sound more silly than scary, coming from a man who's vocalizing vague memories that happened at such a young age.

I also want to state that I brought up the general Southeast Texas region as well just in case this wasn't something that only happened in my hometown, and so I could find more people that possibly could share similar stories. But if you are from Port Martin, I'd love to discuss. 

Anyways, It's been a substantial amount of years since I've had any connection to the city since my Dad passed, he was really the only reason I was raised there at all.

He, doing what I can assume most of the others who lived in the town did, found a job at the city's local refinery. I believe it was around when I was a toddler before I had any form of recollection that he first moved there. My late elementary school years up to when we left were what I can remember the most from this period. Memories of harsh storms when the school years began and odd friends who had very off-putting interests are some of the first things I can recollect, but the most distinct and frankly horrifying thing I remembered from that time was the screams that came from the refinery across the river.

Our house was in a very bad area, my mom always kept the closest care of me when it came to being dropped off and picked up, I used to think of her as overly cautious but I still just went along with whatever she told me, I was very distant from any form of socialization (Which I still pay for now). 

The only form of rebellion I did have though, was staying up late on the weekdays and playing on my ds. 

I was so bad at trying to hide it, only a blanket and my reflexes protected me from my mom's wrath. When I was punished I'd either just give up and pass asleep or decide to stand and stare out my window.

My view was one that would be depressing for most, but as a young child I was always intrigued of it. The orange-brown sky lit from the large warm colored bulbs that scattered the large pipes and cylinders like a Lite Brite. Thick clouds pushed up into the starless sky with particles of chemicals I had absolutely no clue of. 

It was enormous, it covered the view of my window like the wall, only our backyard's chain-link fence and deep black reflective field of the canal and marsh were in the foreground in front of the giant factory. It looked like a city full of life from the distance, and knowing my Dad took the night shift at that alluring complex made me jealous of how lucky he was to work there.

But on most nights, for as young as I could remember, the thing that attracted me most to it were the noises it made that I could hear from my room. 

My window must've been dilapidated somewhat cause I could hear every noise that came from outside. I was able to always hear the sounds of crickets and other odd critters outside yelling into my ear that they were right on the windowsill.  

The factory made groans, noises of heavy machinery, but almost always from what I could track was about once a weak was the most unusual screams and shrieks I've ever heard in my entire life. 

Howling what seemed impossible for machinery to make, shrieks that were indistinguishable to how many could have been making them because of how loud they were. 

I never understood how I could hear these noises from hundreds of yards away, but I guess my romanization of this odd palace of metal and steel made me only fascinated by the sounds rather than scared (I had what I now  think were very odd quirks when I was young).

Listening during that one random night of week at the ever-changing noises of discord and echo just kept making me more and more curious as the years went on.

Unfortunately, it was just around the peak of curiosity when my Dad died, a horrible workplace accident that I was too distant to understand the magnitude of.

I hate to say I was never close to him but he was always just so invested in his work that I really never had many chances to see him. He was still a positive role model and I used to look up to his line of work but I still was always felt separated away from him. I don't think he ever had breaks or long periods where I shared any time with him that would people would consider "bonding." Any memories of him at home consisted of quiet nights and arguments between my him and my mom whether I should be allowed to visit the factory or not. Of course I was always wanting to go and was time and time again disappointed when my mom forced me to stay home, but as I aged and grew some form of common sense that's what I came to appreciate her protection of me in those moments.

Immediately after my dad's passing, around the time me and my Mom packed up and moved away, my attraction to the factory began to change. It began showing up in my dreams in a much more sinister fashion, horrific visions of my father yelling for me inside of a boiling vat, terrifying nightmares of the stacks and pipes dripping with black mixed blood oozed over my body, hundreds of thick figures made of dripping tar pulled me deep into the lake of dark crimson oil below. But what was worst of all, was the screams followed me through this all. 

Maybe it was just some form of tinnitus, but for what felt like such a long time, almost every night the wails and groans echoed lowly in my ears when everything went silent. 

It took about till the end of my 6th grade until that and the nightmares went away. All my memories that were at an age that most share as their most nostalgic were now one painted over with a black veil of horror, and I don't even fully understand why. 

I can assure you I became somewhat normal as my high school years began, I was living in what my Mom considers a infinitely better city than Port Martin could've ever been and I just began carrying through my life normally. The memories finally reached to the back of my head, and the memories seemed so silly, I never even cared to bring it up to anyone before, including my Mom. 

One of those nightmares returned to me last night, and honestly just regenerated an extremely odd core memory that I just really needed to bring up somewhere. 

I've contacted my Mom, and I'm planning on learning more about that old hometown's history that I've neglected doing for way too long. 

If this gets any traction I'll for sure post any more information I've found on Port Martin in my free-time. I think it will be interesting to be more in touch with my and possibly others childhoods in what is really such an unusual part of America.

Thank you for reading, and again I'll try and give consistent updates whenever I have the time . - :)
