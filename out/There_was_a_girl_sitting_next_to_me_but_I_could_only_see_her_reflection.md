There was a girl sitting next to me. When I looked to my right, the desk, propped against the furthest corner of the room, was empty, as it had been for as long as I could remember. But when I looked at the reflection, there she was, her head buried into her arms, as if endlessly playing a game of hide-and-seek. It was hard to tell exactly what colour her hair was, but judging from how light it was, I would be inclined to say blonde or brown. Her form was barely visible like smoke dying out. There were days when I'd sit by the window just to watch her reflection. Her clothes were always the same, regardless of the weather; a light sweater and a black pleated skirt. One day, upon having had enough of looking at her back, I nudged Max and pointed at the window.

"Do you see something there?" He rolled his eyes before turning his head towards the direction of the girl. The moment he did, however, his eyelids drooped. Like a veil, something glazed over his black eyes, causing his mouth to slack. I repeated his name, but he remained fixated on her. Or, rather, beyond her. It was only when my hands oscillated violently in front of him that his eyes regained life, and they finally peeled off of her.

"Dunno. Did you find a cool cloud or something?" He yawned and stretched his arms.

"You were looking at it too," I stated matter-of-factly, earning me a pair of furrowed eyebrows. "That girl. You were looking at her, weren't you?"

"What are you talking about, dude? Leave the pranks to me. It's never going to work with you." He turned his attention to the teacher, continuing with his life as normal. But he had seen it, I was sure of it. Either he was lying and acting stupid, or something about how his eyes went dull affected him. However, chasing a lead for a paranormal entity was starting to become tiresome, extremely so. If ghosts were a thing, then why should I try to prove their existence? After all, the dead can't do anything, right?

The next day was when things changed. I sat down and began my day as normal and watched as Max entered the room, giving me a quick nod when our eyes met.

"Hey, Penny." I froze, waiting for him to burst out laughing. However, after several seconds passed, his face remained the same.

"...You mean John," I corrected and watched as confusion turned into surprise and surprise into laughter.

"Holy shit, man," He slapped his forehead, his cackles ending in a sigh. "I don't know what came over me. Sorry." I knew Max was never the smartest, and sure he always made jabs at how ‘unmanly’ I looked, but he was my closest friend. We'd known each other since kindergarten. Hell, he could probably name the first three generations of my family tree without getting a name wrong. So to mistake my name for one not only in the wrong gender but sharing no similarities to John whatsoever, was beyond odd.

I mumbled a response, my attention being drawn back to the girl. The moment my eyes laid upon her, the blood in my veins turned to ice. I could actually see her hair. The once ephemeral, faded tendril had turned a pastel blonde, where I could make out strands that looked as if they'd been woven from gold. And now, her face wasn't pressed against her arms, but facing the front, her gaze bore holes through the chalkboard.

I twisted back to where the reflection sat, and yet again, the seat was empty. I shook my head in an attempt to rid my mind of the distraction. The teacher was murmuring the class’ names, clearly having lost the patience to withstand repeating the process every day. Only then did I realize the teacher skipped my name, which sat between Mary and James. I raised my hand, and it took the teacher an unbearably long time to notice it.

"Oh, and John," He murmured, clicking on the mouse of the laptop, before carrying on. I couldn't pay attention to the rest of his words, my heart beating at a speed that wasn't quite healthy. And yet, I continued to do nothing. If I just continued to ignore her, I would be fine. That was the promise I made to myself, the promise I broke the very next second when curiosity got the best of me and I stole one final glance at the glass pane.

She was staring at me. The moment our eyes met, I practically slammed my head down. I expected my sudden jolt in movement to earn me a few glances, but the only one who noticed was Max, who offered me a chortle. It happened in a few milliseconds, so I couldn't be a hundred percent sure her reflection truly was looking at me. But the thought of taking so much as another peek forced me to keep my eyes glued to the front.

The next few days, I managed to ignore her presence. That didn't mean things were returning to normal. On the contrary, I felt my relevance in class decreasing. The teacher would just so happen to glance over my raised hand without ever calling on me, students would bump into me despite looking straight ahead, and even Max forgot to greet me in the morning.

As if things couldn't get any worse, she was no longer remaining in the window. When I pulled my phone out, the black screen revealed a girl standing right behind me. Our eyes met, and I could feel my mind scream in agony, my body seemingly paralyzed. My lips struggled to move, my voice struggling to form words, my eyes unable to blink. She looked at me with pity, her eyebrows upturning, her mouth opening slightly. Her lips moved in synchronization with her tongue, clearly attempting to speak. All I heard was a series of low moans, but the class begged to differ.

A majority of them turned their heads around to face me, and for the first time, my existence was acknowledged. Or, at least, I thought they were staring at me, because when their eyes met mine, their features went blank, their expressions empty. After a while, they'd turn back and pretend the event never happened.

When she finally disappeared, I found myself able to move. Using this opportunity, I jumped up, the chair crashing down audibly enough to cause the teacher to pause. Once again, their attention turned to the back of class, and once again, I wasn't the target.

"What the hell is happening?" I shouted, my eyes desperately searching for someone who would be willing to answer. When no one spoke, I repeated myself, louder and with more vigor. This time, however, they all averted their eyes, and the teacher continued. My further attempts were drowned out by the bell, and the classroom quickly cleared. I gripped Max's arm before he could leave, shouting at him for answers.

"Sorry, I gotta go," He mumbled, his words barely escaping his lips. His eyes refused to look anywhere close to me, instead opting to awkwardly keep his head down. "See ya." And with that, he walked out, his figure quickly disappearing into the sea of students.

"Why aren't you saying anything?!" My voice grew desperate, the silence suffocating me. I turned to the window, hoping that the blonde-haired reflection of that girl would appear, just so I could get an answer, an explanation, anything. But the only reflection staining the glass was mine, and even that barely held on, a blurry outline being the only evidence of my presence.

No one at home reacted to my knocks, not even when I slammed the door. No one answered their phones. When I tried the handle, the door opened without issue. Mom greeted me with her usual "Welcome home, honey," And a surge of hope welled up in my chest.

"Mom!" I cried out, running up to her and embracing her. "I was seeing things, and people weren't responding, and... and..." She didn't respond, her eyes scanning the hallway with confusion.

"Who're you talking to, dear?" Dad asked from the living room, his face buried in some newspaper. Mom just shook her head with a scoff, turning back around to the counter and freeing herself of my embrace.

"I thought I heard someone," She said, turning on the sink faucet and washing the dishes. "But no one came through the door."

"No, mom," I said, gripping her arm. "Look at me." My desperate shakes were met with a reaction, but they weren't ones of recognition.

"Gosh, my hands are shaking," She laughed, setting the knife down. "Can't afford to be cut, can I?" She dried her hands and walked towards the couch, plopping down and turning on the TV. Dad didn't pay attention, his nose still in his book.

"Look at me!" I screamed, turning the TV off and standing exactly where Mom's eyes fell. "Tell me you see me!" My voice broke, and I expected Dad to make a joke about how I was hitting puberty, only for Mom to slap him on the shoulder. But none of that happened. Mom just turned the TV on again, this time with an irritated look.

"We need to get this remote fixed," She grumbled, fidgeting with the device. "I swear it's going off whenever it pleases." I took several steps back, shaking my head, before dashing to my room. This was a dream. It had to be. A terrible, terrible dream. I ignored the fleeting second that my peripherals caught off the reflection of my mirror showing a trail of golden hair slithering away, and when I woke up, I ignored my parents and bolted straight for the door under the naive assumption that everything was fine.

The bus didn't stop for me, and only when another kid ran to the stop did the doors open. When I slunk into my seat, first in class as usual, I glared at the door, watching everyone walk in one by one. My eyes were so fixated that I didn't notice Max approaching, a smile spreading across his face. No longer were his pupils glazed over, and I realized that this was the first time he had actually looked at me. I opened my mouth to greet him.

But someone else beat me to it.

"Good morning, Max," Her voice was meek and quiet, waving a hand that was partially covered by a brown sweater. Rays of sunshine fell upon the class through the window, a halo of light encircling her. A ponytail that was once the colour of ash now resembled molten gold, a colour that would make the most brilliant of gems seem like imitations and her eyes contained the ocean, housing thousands if not millions of lives.

Max smiled back, his voice booming in an animated tone, "Morning, Penny!" I could do nothing but watch as the two went back and forth, reliving experiences that I was supposed to be a part of, and sharing jokes that were supposed to be directed at me. I was the one who was pushed off of the diving board and had red welts across my body, not her. I was the one who got Max a CD that cost half of my month's allowance, not her. But Max didn't agree, the students didn't agree, and Penny sure as hell didn't agree.

I looked out the window, spotting that a seat was empty. My seat. Looking down at my hands, I saw as hazy fingers phased in and out of existence, and though I was pale before, what covered my body was nothing short of the colour of soot. In a last-ditch attempt, I tried for my phone. My fingers, weak and with barely enough strength to lift themselves, finally managed to grasp the device.

The process of pushing down on the screen for it to register my fingerprint was agonizingly slow, and by the time I finally sent a message to Max, half of the period had ended. Yet, the results I yielded were nothing more than a momentary glance before he swiped the notification as if it were a bug.

My fingers struggled to keep typing, and every attempt felt like a battle against death itself. It took me ten minutes just to finish the message, and I had barely gotten through a sentence. My motivation was all but gone, and I couldn't bring myself to even send the message. I lay on the ground, letting Penny and Max's occasional laughs pierce my ears. Did she even know of what she had done to me? The life she took? She didn't deserve it. She was the one who deserved to be rotting here, in the reflections, where no one can see her and no one can remember her.

I dragged my body over to her, my teeth grinding as I saw her dimples form when her smile widened. My fingers wrapped around her throat, doing little more than pushing the fabric of her sweater.

"Look at me," I hissed, pressing my face mere inches away from hers. "Look. At. Me. I know you can see me!" My voice shook with rage, but not once did her expression change. My stamina depleted causing my arms to drop to my side. The final nail in the coffin was the sound of laughter coming from Max, a laugh that was once meant for me.

I've been writing this out for the past week, forcing myself to bring words on the screen. I don't even know why I bother; if the outcome is anything like what happened to Max, you've probably already forgotten everything I've written.

After the first week, boredom had set in. It was gruelling, watching everyone walk past me, memories of the good old days being made now belonging to her. I couldn't take it. But I won't let her get away with this. With nothing else to do, I dragged my body off of the floor, using the walls for support. I stalked the classrooms, but with all of the doors closed, I couldn't manage to enter any of them. Any but one. The door, just barely ajar, led to one of the science classrooms. It took all I had in me just to push it enough to squeeze through.

The teacher looked in my direction, but I had had my hopes crushed too many times to assume she could see me. The same applied to the rest of the students, who were either busy with work or sleeping. I shuffled to the back, where I leaned against the wall for support. My weight shifted, causing the wood to creak loud enough to alert the whole class. However, none of them took longer than a momentary glance.

My fingers struggled to keep typing, and every attempt felt like a battle against death itself. It took me ten minutes just to finish the message, and I had barely gotten through a sentence. My motivation was all but gone, and I couldn't bring myself to even send the message. I lay on the ground, letting Penny and Max's occasional laughs pierce my ears. Did she even know of what she had done to me? The life she took? She didn't deserve it. She was the one who deserved to be rotting here, in the reflections, where no one could see her and no one could remember her.r.

There was always tomorrow.
