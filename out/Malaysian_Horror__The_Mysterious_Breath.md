With Halloween around the corner, I thought what a better time to share a few personal experiences on here. So here goes...

This incident goes a long way back to the early 90s. I was 16 years old then. Interestingly enough, it occurred in what seemed to be the most unlikely of places... in a church somewhere in Petaling Jaya!

I had attended one of those teen church camps which usually lasted for 3 days or so. There had been a couple of activities arranged leading up to the last day, where we all had different tasks assigned. Me, I was responsible for controlling the light switches, and had a set of cues to follow for the night event.

The catch was this. I was to do it from a small room behind the church which housed the circuitry. Unfortunately, it was only accessible from outside the church. In order to get to it, I had to exit the main church hall to the side and into a long dark alleyway (dark at night that is) flanked by the church and another small building. A short staircase then led up to a small verandah outside the room. The small room had only one door, and the opposite wall had windows looking out into the church stage so one can see what was happening.

Anyway, to make a long story short, things didn't go as planned. You know how it is with generation clashes. Some holier-than-thou prick in his mid-20s decided to take it upon himself to play with the switches in the main hall as he saw fit without informing me (and people wonder why I have problems with authority figures!). Little did they know there was a very, VERY ANGRY person in that room then. ME! And then it happened.

A heavy kind of breathing. It didn't hit me at first. I had attributed it to the speaker on stage having some breathing problems since his speech was pretty much amplified thanks to the amplifiers around the hall. It continued for awhile, and when it didn't go away, I went to the window and pricked my ear to the nearest sound system in the room. Still, I couldn't figure out the source of the breathing. It was puzzling. Since the speech was pretty loud, and I was getting really bothered by the breathing, I decided to exit the room to the small verandah outside. Halfway to the door, I got creeped out.

Anyone knows that anytime you move further away from a noise source, the noise starts to fade out. Not this breathing! It stuck at the same decibel. And what's worse, this time it felt more like as if someone was next to me breathing heavily into my ear, but there was no one visible around. When the realization hit me that something was seriously out of place, I started to shake. I couldn't move. Here was this heavy breathing next to me, and I had a million things bombarding my mind on what to do. By instinct, I mumbled a prayer, and it was only then the heavy breathing stopped. A sense of relief overwhelmed me as I made my final steps to the door and into the verandah, but it was too much. I practically broke down by the stairs.

After what seemed like an eternity, I heard footsteps. I don't know, but I think someone heard me wailing. A couple of my friends came over to the back room, and asked me what happened. I was in a pretty disturbed state then. They accompanied me off the place before I explained what happened. I found out that my supernatural experience was only one of several that other people have reported happened in the church. Explanation-wise, I got the typical "Satanic forces attacking the church". Me, I can only say it was not ordinary or normal, and certainly not a very pleasant experience.

Anyway, years later, I befriended a clairvoyant. One topic led to another, and we started talking about my above past experience. She told me a vision came to her of an old man who was very angry, but for what reason, she had no idea. Me, I just think maybe he wanted to share his anger with, well, another angry person around the corner! Like attracts like, doesn't it? :P
