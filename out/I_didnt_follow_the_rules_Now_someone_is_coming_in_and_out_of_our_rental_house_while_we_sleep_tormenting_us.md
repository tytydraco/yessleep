Looking back, I should have trusted my instinct when I first saw it—*the symbols*. I should have followed the house rules. Now it’s too late, and they’re coming for us.



**Arrival: Three Days Ago**



My wife and I reached our vacation rental in Flagstaff, AZ. When we saw the listing, we knew it was “the one” for our long weekend getaway. A small guest house with a private entrance, green space, a deck, and a small backyard tucked against the pines. The house is removed from downtown, yet only a short 15-minute drive to bars and restaurants. Perfect.



We checked ourselves in using the keypad. My wife waited in the car while I swept the house, a precaution we always take—you can never be too safe. 



“I’ll be right back.”



I unlocked the front door and stepped inside. At first glance, the home looked recently updated and even nicer than the listing photos. 



“Darcy is going to love this place,” I said out loud.



The floors appeared to be the original hardwood planks. Large picture windows with views of the surrounding forest and mountains lined the walls. A fireplace anchored the main living area, hugged by a cozy sofa and love seat. 



I proceeded to the kitchen. On the counter next to the farmhouse sink, a note:



*Welcome to PineHouse!* 



*To make your stay as enjoyable as possible, please do not deviate from our house rules:* 

* *The house is old. Pipes will make noise. Don’t be alarmed*
* *Don’t enter the woods after 11 pm*
* §∆



I paused for a moment and tried to make sense of the demands. I reread the note over and over, but couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. What do the symbols mean? And why would someone go into the woods at night? 



“No reason to alarm Darcy.”



I hid the note in a drawer and continued my sweep of the house. 



I opened the pantry and found the coffee maker and a few extra bowls and pans—nothing unusual. On the way to the primary bedroom, there was a door with a keypad lock and a small framed note reading, “For Host Use Only.” Typical of rental properties.



The primary bedroom had high ceilings and a king-sized bed covered in pillows. It smelled fresh, like lavender. I opened the closet, found a few hangers, then looked through the en suite bath—all clear. 



Only the guest bedroom remained. 



As I stepped into the spare room, I was suddenly met with a brief, foul stench of wet earth and decay. Before I could pinpoint the source of the repulsive smell, my attention quickly snapped to the back of the room. 



The back door was left wide open.



My heart skipped a beat. I moved quickly toward the door to peer outside, looking for any signs of disturbance.



In the distance, another house nestled deeply into the woods was visible.  It had a single window illuminated near the pitch of the roof, giving away position. It was an old A-Frame painted deep black, camouflaging it amongst the trees in the darkening sky.



The slate colored dwelling almost looked like it was alive, feeding on the forest. 



Stalking *this* house with its single lit-up eye. 



*Watching me.*



I felt drawn in, almost under a spell. I couldn’t look away as though the structure put me into a trance state.



“*HEY!!!*” my wife bellowed sharply as she lurched at me.



“Jesus, you scared the living hell out of me!” She always got a kick out of startling me. It worked a little too often.



“Watcha staring at!?”



At least my wife hadn’t seen the door unlocked, wide open for anyone curious enough to sneak in. She was also spared the image of the black dwelling in the woods and its lone gaze devouring the forest seared into her mind. 



“Nothing.”



She would have demanded that we cancel and find another place. I pulled myself away, shut the door, and twisted the deadbolt.

**Night One**



Without warning, I woke up abruptly. Three sounds reverberated from somewhere *inside* the house. 



The first sound was sharp, the second dull and drawn out, the last *booming***.**



Knock. *Draaaagg…* ***BAAANGGG!!***



I looked anxiously at the clock: 2:17 am. 



I grabbed my phone and pocket knife from the nightstand, quietly slipped out of bed, and began to search the house. As I moved between rooms, the floorboards moaned, aching from old age. 



The air was still, and I could hear myself breathing heavily. My heart was pounding as I found my way through the dark, unfamiliar home.



I made it to the guest room and checked the back door. It wasn’t open, but it also wasn’t locked. 



Shit. 



I opened the door to survey the backyard. The forest was pitch black now. Even the house deep in the woods was blanketed in darkness, the window no longer lit.



I let out a deep sigh of relief, stepped back inside, and locked the door tightly.



*Breathe.*



***“The house is old. Pipes will make noise. Don’t be alarmed.”***



••



**Night Two**



It was a little after 11:30 pm. We had just finished watching a movie and were ready to call it a night. This time, I double-checked both external doors. After the first day, I wasn’t taking any chances. 



First, the front door: locked tight.



I started walking toward the guest room. Through the window off the kitchen, I could hear the wind howling. The trees were violently swaying in the darkness. The window was open, and the earthy smell of evergreen invaded the room.



I made my way to the back door. It was gaping open again.



Shit. Shit.



In the distance, in front of the decaying house in the woods, a bonfire had been ignited. Its flames shot up through the canopy of the trees, threatening the night. The flickering orange light danced amongst the canopy of the forest. The thick, heavy smell of smoke circulated in the midnight air.



Against better judgment, I exited the house, closing the distance between me and the edge of the woods. I made my way onto a small path that cut through the forest toward the A-frame, advancing quietly toward the fire. 



A dozen yards in, I saw something tucked between the trees. A silhouette of a person standing 30 yards away. They weren’t moving. They just stood there. 



I couldn’t see their face, but I could feel them gazing directly at me. Like they’d been watching me the entire time. A wave of anxiety and panic washed over my mind. My heart beat against my chest. 



RUN BACK TO THE HOUSE.

  


**“*****Don’t enter the woods after 11 pm.”***

**Night Three**



I was jolted awake: 2:17 am again, exactly. I heard noise from inside the house again, only this time it was long, jagged like teeth, and clawing against walls.



Scraatcch. Scraaaaatch.



Darcy woke up. She looked panicked, pale, as if she’d seen a ghost.



“Did you hear tha…?”



*Scraaaaaatttccccch.*



The hair on my neck stood straight up, nerves on fire. 

  


***“The house is old. Pipes will make noise, don’t be alarmed.”***

  


I jumped out of bed, slowly moved into the living room, and passed the kitchen. As I turned the corner, I saw it. The back door was wide open. 



“No. Not again.”



I looked at the adjacent wall of the guest room. This time, the closet door was also gaping open. The dresser inside moved to the right, exposing a hole that led to a hidden room. 



A crawl space that shouldn’t be there. It didn’t fit the layout of the house.



My nerves electrified like lightning and coursed through my body. My mind and body screamed to turn the other way. But after everything I’d seen and been through, I just had to know.



I crouched down and made my way inside the crawl space. I turned on the flashlight and began canvassing the hollow space. The air was still. There were no windows. The floors were unfinished and made of earth. The room smelled like decay, damp with a faint hint of copper.



In the center of the room was an object I couldn't quite make out. I moved nervously closer. My heart pounded, trying to escape my chest. The walls felt like they were closing in on me.



A black box.



It looked heavy, about 12 inches square. There was a thick liquid seeping from the bottom across the dirt floor. I froze as I further inspected the box. On the upper right corner, two symbols were imprinted in wet ebony paint:

  


**§∆**

  


Suddenly, I heard Darcy dart into the guest room behind me. She sounded panicked.



“*Where are you!*?” she cried.



“Whatever you do, **do** ***NOT*** **come in here**!”



••



**Right Now**



I dragged myself out of the crawl space, trying to process what I’d just seen. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. 



“We have to leave*,*” I said desperately. “Darcy, get your things and get in the car.”



“What the hell is going on!? *WHAT WAS THAT*!?”



“I’ll explain on our way home. Right now, I just need you to trust me. We need to leave… ***NOW***”



We left the room, the back door still open. Darcy started chaotically stuffing our clothes and belongings into our bags while I started the car. I ran back into the house, grabbed everything, and tossed it into the backseat.



Finally, I began driving down the long, narrow dirt road away from the house. Darcy was in shock, crying. I felt overwhelmed with panic. 



As we continued to descend the driveway, I took one last glance in the rearview mirror at the guest house.



The front door was now wide open. 



I see someone exiting the house… *running after the car,* ***shrieking*****.** 



They quickly reach the end of the driveway and abruptly stop. Standing there, staring as we continued to drive away, the house vanishing from view.



••



An hour later, on the way home, Darcy was still understandably distraught. She had her phone out when she interrupted the silence in the car as she read from her news feed.



“Police have responded to a call from neighbors who heard screaming in the night. They found a body deep in the woods near an abandoned A-frame. The body was severely burned from a bonfire the night before. A few trees had a mysterious symbol carved into them. This has all the signatures of continued occult activity in the area.”



She paused for a moment before looking me in the eyes.



“The body is missing its head.”
