  
I am a British veteran of the Korean War, now 103 years old. I still drive, write, walk, and read. My hobby for the rest of my retired life is painting, and as I was painting yesterday, I had a flashback to an alarming memory from the Korean War, and I am writing this article.   
  
At the time, UN troops were charging to retake the peninsula, which had been largely taken over by Chinese and North Korean forces, and many British soldiers had fought and died there. No one was left unscathed, and even those who were not seriously wounded suffered minor injuries. My job was to be stationed in a village at the time, guarding it, and during a confrontation with a North Korean soldier, I had my finger cut by a knife.   
  
There were 10 soldiers stationed in the village. The village was in a mountainous area, with UN posts located 1 Kilometre, 3 kilometers, and 5 kilometers north of the village, respectively, at posts 27, 28, and 29. Each station was occupied by 3 soldiers. Having us 9 in total.   
  
Our schedule went like this, 7 hours of patrolling the village, 7 hours guarding the outpost, and 7 hours of sleep, all in a routine. All three outposts followed the same rule: every 7 hours, 3 of us were patrolling, 3 of us were guarding the outpost, and 3 of us were getting rest. The one to two hours were used to meet up at a small temporary house we created as a base to meet up and discuss the things happening with us and the village, and the last hour was used to back up anyone who was sleeping during the meetup. If we had one hour free, we were allowed to do whatever we wanted, Play games with children, eat, sleep… you know.   
  
I patrolled those villages for eight months, and in November, the Korean War, which seemed to be almost over with our defeat, suddenly turned in our favor with our advance, so I stayed behind to patrol the villages while we advanced slowly, and returned to the United States nine weeks before the armistice was negotiated.   
  
The first month in the village didn't look so good, with residents returning to find that their homes had been captured by the North Koreans. A lot of food was looted, all the pets were taken, and all the jewelry was gone. Fortunately, one or two residents saw it coming, and their stash of emergency food kept most of the residents fed for a while. Most importantly, this place was under the road every day on the way north so they could get food when the remaining UN troops came up here. It was the southernmost village, so it was safe for now.   
  
But we were on constant alert ever since we came to the village. And who would have expected that the things we were going to see all happen because of our chain of victories?  
  
—  
I told you there were three outposts in the village, I was the 27th outpost, the closest outpost to the village, and the two people I stayed with at the time were a sniper named John and a medic named Philip. John was patrolling the village, I was manning the post, Phillip was resting inside, and all of a sudden. I heard a transmission from the Radio.  
  
Emergency meeting, emergency meeting... All to base… all to base...   
  
Surprised by the sudden emergency call, we headed into town. We entered the village to find the residents waiting for us... No, I saw them expecting us. I passed a woman and saw extreme fear in her eyes. I realized something had happened and went into the house.  
  
One of the British soldiers asked an officer.   
  
"What, at this time of night, are we going to have a booze party?"   
  
The senior officer slapped the Soldier.  
  
"Emergency Meeting, idiot, get inside."   
   
"No. Are there any spies or enemies in here tonight? What are we doing? Report it."  
Forgetting that the man in front of him was his superior, the Soldier lashed out at him. But his superior looked at him with concern.  
"A villager was killed."  
Eh?   
I needed to hear it again.  
''A murder?''  
   
The senior officer let us inside before closing the gates. Inside, three soldiers were hovering over a body, a small torso lying on the floor, covered with a cloth. As we all gathered, one of us raised the cloth. The body inside, whose traditional white clothing was stained with blood, had a gaping hole in its torso, and most of its organs had been disemboweled, including the Small intestine, heart, and liver.   
  
The victim was a boy in his teens; what kind of madman would do this to a young person… I was at a loss for words.   
  
Korean soldiers came in, and they, too, were at a loss for words when they saw the bodies.   
  
I had seen gory corpses in war, but I had never seen this level of brutality.  
  
The victim was a resident, the cause of death was blood loss, the weapon was probably a hammer or a saw, and there was no evidence where the victim was found: no blood, no footprints. It was one of the soldiers on patrol who found the body, and according to his testimony, the victim had been dead for several days. The military doctor re-examined the body and had to believe that he had been dead for two days before it was found. So the question then becomes, why did we find this body today after patrolling a two-kilometer village all day? It was highly questionable that it was the North Koreans. The nearest North Korean base is 151 kilometers from here, and there are friendly bases all around that prevent them from getting here.   
  
They questioned all the soldiers about the murder, but they all had alibis for the date of death, at least 60 hours before the time of death. The villagers said they didn't see the soldiers doing anything suspicious, and the boy who followed the three all day said they were just circling the village.   
  
There was only one possibility left. The killer was one of the villagers. This hypothesis was confirmed when a South Korean soldier there translated what the residents were saying to us, and this is not the first time. In 1948, two years earlier, a similar event had occurred, and several residents had fled the village in terror.   
  
A temporary lockdown was stationed in the village; we forced every resident to be at home most of the day until we captured the killer. The culprit is one of them... That much was certain.   
  
A few hours later, one of the South Korean soldiers translated the information from a nearby police box and sent it to us. From 1948 to 1950, nine children died in similar ways, the youngest of whom was seven years old.    
  
There were four witnesses in total, and the information from them in common was that the killer was a male in his 30s, right-handed, and wearing black shoes.   
  
The reasoning goes on to say that only a butcher could kill a human being in such a deliberate and horrific way. Of course, this is also their reasoning, but in the Korean caste system (which disappeared in 1894, but some villages had the concept of a caste system at that time), butchers were the lowest class. In short, they just suspected them rather than reasoning.   
  
But the British seriously believed the murders were the work of a butcher, a profession that could kill with precision and brutality. Although unreliable, the first murder was committed in the butcher’s house.  
  
Many people have used their familiarity with the slaughterhouse to deduce that the killer did it in front of them, but the other reasons are irrefutable.   
  
Thus, the first suspect became the butcher. The British secretly monitored the butcher, even rerouting their patrols to pass by the suspect's house every 20 minutes.   
Naturally, the villagers were already convinced that the butcher was the culprit, and I gradually saw that he was going psychologically insane. It's terrible when the whole town treats you as a criminal because of your status. It's like watching a time when black people didn't have rights in America. To be insulted for being a butcher... Because of your profession…   
  
Three days after he became a suspect, I was on patrol in the village. The time was 3:09 p.m. I remember the exact time. Every time I patrol that town, I pass that butcher shop, and every third time, I stop at the post office right next to it to rest. On the first cycle, I passed the post office; on the second cycle, I passed it; and on the third cycle, as I passed the butcher and saw the post office, I doubted my eyes.   
  
It takes me to patrol all the areas I patrol is 10 minutes, meaning if I walk past a post office, I'll be in front of it in 10 minutes.  
  
In that ten minutes, a pole was erected, and on it hung the body of a boy whose hands were bound with wire and whose organs had been removed. It was my first time seeing a real murderer, and it was horrifying, the entrails and heart strewn across the floor, the blood running and pooling on the ground. If the pain hadn't killed him, he would have bled to death.   
  
Summoned all soldiers to the murder scene. I also summoned the butcher, and I asked him,   
  
"Why is there another murder in front of your house?  
  
Suddenly irritated, the translator listened to him, said something, and translated for us.  
  
"I don't know."  
  
We didn't believe him this time and searched the butcher's house. He tried to stop us, but we did not care, and we smashed and turned his house upside down. Finally, the higher-ups found something that looked like evidence, and we investigated the butcher. The evidence they presented was a bloody butcher knife.   
  
To investigate further, we took the butcher to the base.   
  
I continued to patrol, and three soldiers began to search the area. An hour later, the last time I passed the house, they came out.  
  
"No evidence."  
  
All that was left was to listen to what the interrogation had yielded, so we headed back to the base to find the butcher. When we entered the base, we found blood on the tent, the butcher lying there, a gun at his feet, and none of the men who had interrogated him dead.   
  
This is a suicide.   
  
The comrades gave us a piece of paper with a translation of all his statements.  
  
All of them were statements denying the allegations against him, and the problem is, while we were looking into it, the team that was interrogating the butcher found evidence of his innocence. The butcher was never home at the time of the victim's death in the first place.  
  
The investigation to a blank canvas after the death of the butcher.  
  
Back at the canvas, we wrote down new information: another murder had occurred, the main suspect was dead, and he wasn't even at the crime scene before the murder, and, most importantly, the second murder happened while I was away for twenty minutes.  
  
To use a Korean metaphor, it was like the work of a ghost. Not literally by a ghost, but by an entity that can destroy evidence as quickly and instantly as a ghost. Of course, the culprit is human.  
  
If the butcher wasn't the killer, then who the hell was? Up to this point, much of the evidence had been pointing toward the house and its owner, even the murders that took place when he wasn't around. Then suddenly, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of the evidence was strange, and the butcher committed suicide.   
  
With the cooperation of the South Korean military, we picked up the files from a nearby police station and translated them, so we found why the butcher was a suspect. It wasn't evidence; it was psychology. There was no physical evidence that he was a murderer, only the interrogations and suspicions of others.   
  
This guy was Legitimately getting framed.  
  
The butcher was buried in a nearby field, the murderer having taken another human life in this way. I went back to guard the post, and even at the post, I kept thinking about it, the body of the child I found, and the suicide of the butcher. Who would have thought, in the middle of a war, there's a serial killer, and in a combat zone?   
  
The British army began to entertain other theories: perhaps the murders were actually the work of a spy, or perhaps there was a spy stationed in town in 1948... But this hypothesis was very dangerous because if we suspected the villagers of being spies, there was a high probability that a massacre would soon follow. All we could do was investigate.   
  
That night, the soldiers gathered back at the hideout, and no one could have predicted who the killer would be. The suspect in the two-year investigation had committed suicide, and the evidence pointed to his innocence from the day we arrived and the next thing we knew, we wondered if there would be another murder.
