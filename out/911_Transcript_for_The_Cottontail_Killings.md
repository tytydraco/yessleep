911 Operator: 911. What's your emergency?

Caller: My name is Ella Ramirez and I’m hiding behind a dumpster behind the old shutdown movie theater on McGlothlin Avenue. There is someone following \[Inaudible\] think he is going to hurt me. I need a police officer.

911 Operator: Okay, Ella. Stay calm and stay on the line with me. I’m dispatching officers to your location now. It looks like they are about five minutes away. Stay where you are as long as it is safe. Can you see the person right now?

Caller: No. \[*Light Sobbing*\] I haven’t seen him in a few minutes but I don’t know where he is. Please, send someone now.

911 Operator: They are on their way, Ella. Can you describe the person who is following you?

Caller: They are tall… like over six feet. I think it’s a man, but I don’t know. He is wearing a white Easter Bunny costume and it looks like the legs are covered in blood. I saw him in an alley dragging… oh God, I think he killed someone and was trying to pull their body out of a street light. When he saw me, he \[Inaudible\] started running toward me.

911 Operator: Alright. Six feet tall. White rabbit costume with possible blood on the legs. Where did you first see them?

Caller: It was over on Short Street between the antique store and the used bookshop. There is a little alleyway I usually cut through on my way home from work, but when I turned in he saw me and… \[*Sobbing*\] I think I hear something. What should I do?

911 Operator: Stay quiet, Ella. My system shows that the officers should be at your location in about three more minutes. Just try and remain calm until they get there. Do you think he can see you?

Caller: I don’t know. \[*Inaudible*\] sounds like a car engine. I’m going to look and see if it’s the cops. Maybe they are here already!

911 Operator: No, Ella! My system shows the officers are still two minutes away. Remain out of sight until they arrive. Do not…

***The audio becomes difficult to hear for a few moments. Ella Ramirez can be heard calling out to someone before screaming and dropping the phone.***

Unknown Male: \[*In Background*\] Hey there, honey! You’ve been a bad little bunny. Now I’m gonna have to hurt you.

911 Operator: Ella? Are you there? If you can hear me, please run toward Park Avenue from McGlothin. Officers are nearby. Ella?

\[*Screams*\]

\[*Loud crunch followed by disconnect tone*\]

***7:38 PM: End Call.***

***PCPD officers Berry and Denton arrived on the scene behind the Martin 4 Cinema Movie Theater on McGlothlin Avenue. After a brief search of the scene, a smashed iPhone 12 was found behind the corner of a garbage dumpster. There was a small quantity of blood by the phone leading to a set of black tire marks. The blood was tested against samples from the Ramirez home and determined to belong to Ella Ramirez. Pictures of the tire tracks were sent to the crime lab and determined to be a mass-produced tread pattern common to industrial vans. No unique identifiers in the tire tracks were detected.***

***A search of the nearby area produced a secondary crime scene located between Pepper’s Old Books and Kesterson’s Antiques on Short Street. Large amounts of blood were discovered in the location where Ella Ramirez reported seeing the subject in the rabbit costume dragging a body. No other evidence was recovered at the scene.***

***A BOLO notice was distributed to all local agencies for Ella Ramirez and the unidentified victim from the alleyway with no sightings reported.***

***6:23 AM: Randy Teague of Pasadena Creek calls PCPD to report a strange object discovered on his front steps.***

911 Operator: 911. What is your emergency?

Caller: Yes, this is Randy Teague and I live on \[Redacted\]. I just went outside to get the morning paper and found an Easter basket sitting on my front steps. At first, I figured my parents must have left it as a surprise for the girls, but y’all need to come see this.

911 Operator: What is the concern, sir?

Caller: Ma’am, I’m pretty sure there is blood coming out from the plastic eggs in the basket. There are flies swarming all over the damn thing and… shit! Yeah, that’s blood. It’s starting to pool up under the basket.

911 Operator: Please close and lock your door, sir. We will have officers over immediately. Do not go outside or attempt to touch the basket.

Caller: Why the hell would I? Good lord. Tell ‘em to get here quick. I don’t want my wife and girls to see this. Who the hell would do something like this?

911 Operator: Again, please remain inside, sir. Officers will be on location shortly. Do not open the door unless you see a Pasadena Creek cruiser. Do you understand?

Caller: Yes ma’am. Some Easter this is turning out to be. How am I supposed to…

\[*Mr. Teague disconnects call*\]

***6:25 AM: End Call.***

***The following is a call from officers Hicklin and Jones of the PCPD.***

***6:38 AM: Begin dispatch call.***

Officer Hicklin: Dispatch, this is Officer Hicklin calling for a crime scene unit.

Dispatch: Understood, Officer. A crime scene unit will be en route as soon as possible. Please explain the nature of the request.

Officer Hicklin: Jones and I arrived at the Teague Residence a few moments ago. He is inside speaking with the family while I search the property. There are no signs that a perpetrator is still in the area, but we need the crime scene investigators here ASAP to take in this Easter basket.

Dispatch: Understood. Were you able to see what is inside of the eggs in the basket?

Officer Hicklin: Yes, dispatch, but I sure as hell wish I hadn’t. A few of them just have candy in them, but some of them have body parts. There are two sets of what appear to be human eyes. One set appears to be fresh but the second is highly decomposing. And… damn… there are two tongues in another set. Likely human. One fresh and one also highly decomposing.

Dispatch: Officer, techs have been dispatched and will be there as soon as possible. Tape off the crime scene and keep the area clear.

Officer Hicklin: 10-4, dispatch. We will… hey! Please get back inside! Sorry dispatch, one of the little girls just opened the door. Man, I hope they didn’t see this shit.

***6:42 AM: Call End.***

***One set of partial remains was DNA matched to samples retrieved from the Ramirez home and is believed to belong to Ella Ramirez.***

***The second and more decomposed set of partial remains belongs to a yet unidentified female. Oakland Grove Police Department has requested access to the secondary remains to test against known DNA from a missing persons case involving a young woman named Emily Brown.***

***Blood collected from the alleyway was determined to belong to two unidentified males. Samples from this collection have also been set to Oakland Grove PD for comparison with DNA potentially belonging to the suspect in their case.***

***Two of the three victims have yet to be identified. Other than her eyes and tongue, no other remains belonging to Ella Ramirez have yet been*** [discovered.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/uyezti/making_it_easier_to_keep_track_of_my_new_releases/)
