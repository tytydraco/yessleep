I’m just posting this because I feel like I haven’t seen anyone in a few days. That sounds kind of odd, I know, and I feel like I’m kind of going insane, but this has happened before to a lesser extent when I was younger. But that’s not super important. I apologize for rambling. I just haven’t talked to people, other than myself and my cats, in a while. It feels like a week, maybe? I’m not sure.



I work third shift, so seeing and interacting with people was already not a thing I did. On top of that, I was already a loner, so I don’t have many people in my life, other than family, to begin with. I don’t even have social media. I realized I kind of don’t like being angry every time I look at my phone, so now I pretty much just use it to listen to music and take pictures of my cats.



I live with my brother, and he started a job recently, so I haven’t seen him that much since he started. I assume he’s just sleeping or at work. At least I did. I haven’t seen him. I stayed up late a few times and fell asleep on the couch. I must have missed him. His door is usually locked, and whenever I knock, I get no reply. He’s always been a deep sleeper, but not to this extent.



I was thinking about breaking the door down, but we rent, and I don’t know if paranoia is worth all that jazz. Now that I think about it, he works with my sister. There is a chance maybe he sleeps there sometimes. I don’t know if I haven’t spoken to her in some time either. I’ll shoot her a text.



Anyways, that’s the gist of this whole thing. I have not seen anyone in a while, and I feel like I’m descending into madness, but it’s like they say, “paranoia is freedom.” I don’t know if ‘they’ say that, but I heard it in a song, and I think it’s a fun phrase. Sorry for rambling again. This feels like a conversation, and it’s really nice.



Oh shit, I also just remembered there has been almost no wind outside. It’s January in New England. I don’t think that has ever happened. I work outside, and I haven’t been resorting to the full coverall and jacket get-up. I mean, it’s cold, don’t get me wrong, but I haven’t felt a breeze. At least I don’t think so. It’s so hard to tell. I’m still adjusting to third shift, so every day blends together.



My sister still hasn’t texted me back, but that’s a usual thing for her. Maybe I’ll visit her. I haven’t seen my niece and nephew in a while. I probably just need some sleep and a day off. That’s coming up soon, so that’s good.



A street light is flickering, and it’s making me so nervous for some reason. This kind of shit only happens whenever you’re already freaked out, but that also means it’s probably nothing. All those past times, it was nothing, so I really hope it’s also nothing this time.



I just need to calm down, and I’ll probably delete this in a few hours, but maybe someone will see it and let me know people didn’t just suddenly disappear.
