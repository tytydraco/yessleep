The thing about working Search and Rescue above the Arctic Circle is that you get comfortable with silence. Not the absence of sound, there's always wind, always the groan of ice settling, always your own breath fogging in the headlamp beam. I mean the silence of empty space. Miles of it. The kind that makes you understand why the Iñupiat have forty-seven words for different types of darkness.

I'm on my fourth year at the Utqiaġvik SAR station. Tonight's a paperwork shift, which means I'm alone in the operations room with three thermoses of coffee and a stack of incident reports that need signatures. The heater clicks on every twelve minutes. The radios hiss their white noise lullaby. Outside, it's -34°F and the tundra stretches flat and featureless to the horizon like a frozen ocean.

Most people who go missing out here fall into three categories: tourists who underestimate the cold, locals who overestimate their sobriety, and elders who simply walk into the white and don't come back. That last category we don't talk about much. It's cultural. It's complicated. It's not my story to tell.

What I can tell you is this: the radios always click at 03:07.

Not a transmission. Not interference. Just a single, sharp click across all five channels simultaneously. Atmospheric pressure, I told myself for the first two years. Electromagnetic phenomenon. The aurora does strange things to signals up here.

Then last night, I checked the station log going back eleven years.

Every night. 03:07 exactly. Every single night for over four thousand consecutive days.

That's not atmospheric. That's accounting.

And last night, after the click, I heard something else. A sound like papers shuffling. Like someone flipping through a ledger, running their finger down a column of names.

Last night, I heard them stop on mine.

The call came in at 02:47.

I was still staring at the logbook, pen frozen in my hand, when the emergency line lit up. A voice I recognized, Thomas Aqpik, a whaling captain from Browerville speaking fast in a mix of English and Iñupiaq.

His daughter. Eight years old. Nika. She'd taken the dog sled out to check the nets despite being told to wait until morning. The lead dog came back alone an hour ago, still in harness, trailing cut traces.

I was geared up and on my snowmobile in six minutes.

Before I cleared the gate, Auntie intercepted me.

That's what everyone calls her, Auntie. She's not my aunt. She's not anyone's aunt specifically, but she's everyone's Auntie in the way that matters. Seventy-something, worked SAR before there was a formal SAR, knows the ice like she knows her own kitchen. She does dispatch now, mostly, and watches over the younger officers with the intensity of someone who's already buried too many of us.

She stood in front of my snowmobile with one hand raised.

"You know the rules, Benjamin."

I did. Everyone who works out here learns them in the first week, usually delivered as graveyard-shift folklore by veterans with frostbite scars and thousand-yard stares.

Rule One: Don't go out between 3:00 and 3:14 AM unless it's life or death.

Rule Two: If you see figures in the distance that don't move like animals or people, don't acknowledge them. Don't look directly at them. Don't call out. They're called Walkers, and they're always there, you just can't usually see them.

I nodded. "It's 02:49. I'll have her back before three."

Auntie's expression didn't change. She reached into her parka and pulled out a small pouch, seal leather, stitched with sinew, the kind elders keep their most important things in.

"You know the first two rules," she said. "Here's the one they don't tell you until you need it."

She pressed the pouch into my gloved hand. Inside was something hard and angular. Felt like a piece of carved bone.

"If you see yourself ahead of you on the trail," she said, voice dropping to something barely audible over my idling engine, "do not catch up. Do not call to it. Do not try to overtake it. That one's already paid."

The cold suddenly felt colder.

"Paid to who?"

She stepped back from the snowmobile. "The tundra keeps books, Benjamin. The Walkers keep the ledger. Find the girl. Bring her home. But remember, debts don't disappear. They only transfer."

I didn't fully understand. I didn't have time to ask.

I opened the throttle and drove into the dark.

I found Nika at 03:09.

By then I'd already violated Rule One. The search grid had taken longer than expected—, visibility was maybe fifteen feet in the ground blizzard, and I'd had to dismount three times to check tracks. When I finally spotted the shape in my headlamp, small and dark against the snow, I felt a surge of relief so intense it was almost painful.

She was curled inside a frost heave, a perfect square of uplifted ice, about four feet on each side, edges geometrically sharp in a way that natural ice never forms. She wasn't shivering. Wasn't crying. Just sitting there with her knees drawn up, head down, like she was waiting for a bus.

"Nika!" I called, killing the engine and running toward her. "Nika, honey, it's Ben from SAR. Your dad sent me. Are you hurt?"

She didn't respond.

I knelt beside her, pulling off my glove to check her face for frostbite. Her skin was cold but not frozen. Pupils reactive. Breathing steady. She looked up at me with an expression I've never quite been able to describe. Not fear. Not relief. Something closer to resignation.

"They said you'd come," she whispered.

"Who said?"

That's when I made the mistake.

I turned my headlamp to check behind her, to see if there was someone else, maybe a older sibling or a lost hiker who'd been sheltering with her.

The beam swept across the figure standing directly behind her.

Tall, maybe eight feet. Impossibly thin. Black against the sky but somehow darker, like it was absorbing the light rather than reflecting it. No face. No features. Just a silhouette that held itself in perfect stillness.

Except for its right arm.

Its right arm was slightly outstretched, angled down, exactly mirroring my own posture as I held the flashlight.

I froze.

The Walker—, remained motionless for three seconds. Four. Five.

Then it tilted its head.

Not like an animal cocks its ear to listen. Like someone examining an interesting specimen. The gesture was perfectly calibrated, measured, almost curious. It was the exact head-tilt I do when I'm assessing an injured hiker's mobility.

It was *my* gesture.

I heard my own voice in my head, screaming the rules. *Don't acknowledge them. Don't look directly at them.*

Too late. I was staring right into the void where its face should be.

The Walker held my gaze for another impossible moment.

Then it simply wasn't there. No fade, no movement. Between one heartbeat and the next, the space behind Nika was empty.

I grabbed the girl, pulled her onto my back, and ran for the snowmobile.

I don't remember the ride back. I remember Nika's small arms around my neck. I remember my speedometer pinned at 47 mph across terrain I normally take at 15. I remember the station lights appearing in the distance like a miracle.

I remember checking my watch as we crossed the gate.

03:13.

Nika was fine. Mild exposure, no frostbite, no injuries. Dehydrated but alert. The clinic kept her for observation and she was released to her parents that morning with a clean bill of health.

I was a hero. Thomas Aqpik shook my hand so hard I thought he'd dislocate my shoulder. The station chief wrote me up for a commendation. Someone brought donuts.

Auntie pulled me into the supply room and closed the door.

"You looked at it."

It wasn't a question.

I nodded.

She closed her eyes for a long moment. When she opened them, they were wet.

"You saved the girl," she said quietly. "That's good. That's what you should have done. But you need to understand what happens now."

She sat down heavily on a crate of emergency flares.

"The Walkers—they're not ghosts. They're not demons. They're...auditors. The tundra takes people, Benjamin. That's just what it does. Has for hundreds years. But there are rules. Balance. When someone goes missing, their name goes in the ledger. The Walkers come to collect."

"Collect what?"

"The debt. The space they took up. The warmth they borrowed from the world. My grandmother tried to explain it once. The words don't translate right." She rubbed her face. "Point is—Nika's name was in that ledger. You found her alive. You brought her back."

"So the debt is closed. That's good."

"No." Her voice was flat. "The debt doesn't disappear. You looked directly at a Walker. You acknowledged it. By doing that, you accepted the transfer. Someone still has to pay. The ledger needs a name."

My stomach dropped.

"Now it's yours."

She stood up, pulled me to my feet, looked me hard in the eyes.

"You have seven shifts. When the clock hits 03:07, seven nights from now, the Walkers come for you. Unless you balance the ledger another way."

"What way?"

"A missing person call will come in. You find them. Alive. And then you… transfer the debt. The case closes clean, your slate is wiped, and you walk away a free man."

A cold void opened in my stomach. "That can't be true."

"It is. Your name leaves the book. Another one takes its place."

The horror of it locked my jaw. When I could finally speak, the words were a whisper. "You're telling me I have to condemn an innocent."

Her expression didn't change. "I'm telling you the rules. What you do with them is between you and the ice."

She left me in the supply room with my thoughts and the distant hum of the refrigeration unit.

Seven shifts.

Six days.

By the end of the week, I either save a life or sacrifice one.

The worst part?

I'm already thinking about the math.

The next night, I drew solo patrol. Routine sweep of the lake road, checking the ice fishing shelters, making sure no one's passed out drunk in their truck.

Quiet shift. Empty tundra. The aurora was out, painting the sky in sheets of green and violet.

At 03:07, the radio clicked.

Then the ice beneath my snowmobile vanished.

Not broke through, vanished. A perfect square, eight feet on each side, opened directly under me. I killed the engine and threw myself sideways, rolling onto solid ice as the machine teetered on the edge.

The hole wasn't filled with water.

It was filled with *nothing*. An elevator shaft of absolute black, dropping into a depth I couldn't measure. The aurora light hit the edge and just... stopped.

Then something climbed out.

The Walker rose from the shaft like smoke taking shape. But this time, it wasn't a featureless silhouette.

It was wearing my SAR coat.

The same model, same color, same wear pattern on the left elbow where I lean on the truck door. My name patch was stitched on the breast HARPER, B. but the letters were backwards, mirror-flipped.

It stood on the ice and shifted its weight to one hip, a tired stance I fall into at the end of long shifts.

Then it opened its mouth.

The first sound was static, like a radio stuck between channels. A dry, crackling exhalation that might have been an attempt at breath. It stopped. Tilted its head, my head-tilt, that same analytical gesture, and tried again.

The second sound was closer. A rasp that almost had syllables. Almost had tone.

It was trying to learn my voice.

I pulled my flare gun with shaking hands and fired directly into its chest.

The flare entered the dark coat and kept going. No impact. No light. No sound. Like throwing a stone into a bottomless well. The bright red phosphorus just... disappeared into that infinite black.

The Walker looked down at the entry point. Then back at me.

It tilted its head again.

This time, I recognized the gesture from the inside. That's what I look like when I'm sizing someone up. When I'm deciding if a hiker can make it another mile, or if a victim's story adds up, or if someone's dangerous.

It was learning how I think.

Then it stepped backward into the shaft. The square of missing ice sealed over in an instant, smooth and perfect, like it had never been broken.

I sat there for five minutes before I could move.

I owed them a debt.
