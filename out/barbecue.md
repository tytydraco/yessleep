The woman sat there and just stared at the ugly man next to her, the man she called her husband. He snored as if he was a bear and his breath reeked of cheap beer you get from the dollar store since it was all he could afford for himself after spending hundreds of dollars on the neighbor next door.

The neighbor wasn’t like the wife, the neighbor was younger, her early 20s, curvier, thicker, and sweeter. 

The wife wasn’t old, but she wasn’t young, she had a little belly after she turned 32, she had eyebags from staying up countless nights cooking and cleaning, she wasn’t as sweet as she was before she was married, she actually hated being married. She was forced to marry her husband by her parents who prevented her from being with the real man she loved, she hated her husband’s snotty attitude and him flaunting his wealth in other people’s faces. She hated him so much.

She hated the words that he would say to her, good or bad (mostly bad), she hated his hands and the marks that would form on her.

And she especially hated his sex drive. She hated how he was so non-chalant about her finding out he cheated on her with that young neighbor.

So here the wife was, standing over her disgusting husband, holding his favorite axe that he uses to cut wood for the fireplace.

She raised the axe, as high as she could, and then did it, she killed her husband. The blood oozed down the walls and his mouth was hung open as his decapitated head fell to the floor.

He was still twitching, the nervous system still going in and out, it looked as if he was having a seizure. But once he stopped twitching, the wife sighed.

But she wondered, how was she going to get rid of that god damn body…

The next morning, she waved hello to all of her neighbors, even the young pretty one.

“How the mister?” she asks with a stuck up smile.

“Oh he’s fine!” the wife says. “He’s just with some family, his mother is sick.”

The young neighbor put a pout on her face and walked away from the wife.

Everyone was eating and eating and eating. Meat, meat, meat, all they ate was the gorgeous pink steak she made, medium rare; the best way to cook it. It was a little bloody but it was still good, at least thats what the neighbors thought as that all licked their food covered fingers.

“Why arent you eating, Mrs. Lynn?” a male neighbor asked.

The wife stared at him with a wicked smile and said “I’m on a vegetarian diet, and my husband wanted the meat specifically for you wonderful people!”

The man smiled at her, “you’re so sweet, Mrs. Lynn, and beautiful too, and your husband feeds us well!”

“Yes, yes he does.” she snickers.

But what they didn’t know was that her husband’s insides were the only things she hadn’t cooked… 

That was meant for desert.
