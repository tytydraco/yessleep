It took me so long to realize just how lucky I had it. I grew up in Scott, Louisiana, in an isolated clearing on the outskirts of town. My parents picked the spot and had a house built for us, so their children, my three older sisters and I, could have a space all our own. When we got home from school we could wander across the field, go fishing in the pond, explore the thicket of trees that ringed around our home. In our little heads, it was all ours. For the longest time I took this as a given, a simple fact of life, and only when I got older did I start to appreciate just how beautiful that pocket of land was. Though some of the details have already begun to fade, I still remember the smell of that grass in the humid air of an Acadiana summer. The reflection of the trees on the pond’s surface, the sound of a bass breaking through the water and crashing back down into the murk. The shape of those trees bending to the will of the wind when a hurricane was on its way. I’ve come to accept that I may never see it again, and that memory will only grow dimmer.

I’ve been running for a little over two years now, never staying anywhere for too long, slowly making my way north. I can’t step foot in Louisiana, all that waits for me there is a cold cell. Made it as far as Kansas City, but that feeling’s started surfacing its ugly head again. I can’t stay here another month. I can’t become familiar, I can’t let anyone get a good look at my face. But, I can’t stay silent anymore either. 

Writing this may cost me whatever years outside of a jail I have left, but I warrant they’re not worth much anyway. I need to tell people what really happened at that house. I’ve long abandoned any hope of convincing the police, the state, my sisters, but I have to try whatever I can to warn others. It didn’t stop after us, it’s still preying on people. My family will never be whole again, but maybe you can save yours. Maybe you can succeed where I failed.

The first, and only warning sign came in late July, 2022. I had recently graduated college, and was staying with my mom at that old house in Scott for the time being. I didn’t have a real job yet, and she was kind enough to let me live with her until I could get on my feet. I figured I owed it to her anyway, for all she had done for me and all she was going through, I needed to do everything I could to help her.

She was forced to live with something that, even with what I’ve been through now, I can only begin to understand. A few years before, my dad got into a bad accident while driving home. It left him with a rapid onset case of dementia, which by this time had progressed so far along that my mom had become his full time caretaker. She had to change him, shower him, clean up after him, even feed him if he was reluctant to eat. He didn’t have much longer, and she had to face that every time she looked into her husband’s eyes.

On top of that, my grandmother had moved in to live with her right around the time the accident happened, and now she had to watch over both of them. Taking care of two other adults can be very draining, and left her little room for taking care of herself. Every day I saw the toll it took on her. Even though I loved them both, I could see how they wore her down. It’s not their fault, but it made my mom’s life much harder than any one person can handle without support.

So, I tried to help in whatever small ways I could, in what ways she would let me. She didn’t ever like admitting how much it was all getting to her, she was a strong, proud person. But, even just by cleaning the house, taking care of the trash and the dishes, cooking, looking after my dad when she had to go into town, I like to think it made things a little bit easier for her. I really hope it did. Yet, whatever I could do would eventually prove a poor remedy. That last week of July, in spite of all we had already been through, the long shadow of grief cast itself upon our house again. 

My grandmother, in spite of her old age, was determined to still be an independent woman. She paid little attention to my mom’s precautions and rules, she felt they were unnecessary. One rule was if she wanted to go on a walk she needed to let us know so someone could go with her, but she typically did as she pleased. That night she went for a walk, and hadn’t told me or my mom she was going outside. She usually kept to herself, so it took us a while to notice that she never came back in. When my mom went into her room to give her some medicine, she wasn’t there. 

We looked for what felt like hours, scanning the property for any sign of her. We walked along the treeline, the perimeter of the pond, we even went up and down the road leading out of the clearing in case she made it that far. I remember the panic, the worry that was on repeat in my mind. It brings me some shame, but I wasn’t thinking about whether or not she was safe, I could only think about how it would affect my mom if she wasn’t. I soon got my answer. A piercing cry cut through the thick night air and rang out in my ears, a heart-wrenching wail that I can still hear now.

I wish I had been the one to find her, to this day I wish I could’ve somehow spared my mom that shattering sight, but fate is not so kind. I raced over to the bridge on the edge of our property as fast as I could, figuring that’s where the sound had come from. The beam of her flashlight was fixed on the creek running beneath, even in the dark as I got closer I could see her body shaking, her hand covering her mouth as she fought back another scream. Before a word could make its way out, before I could ask any questions, my eyes followed hers and saw what she couldn’t look away from. On the edge of the creek was my grandmother’s body. Broken, bleeding, and motionless.

The ambulance was there within 15 minutes, but no measurement of time could aptly describe how that wait felt. After I called them we didn’t say a single word, both still in shock. Nothing was said, but my mind cycled through all the possibilities. How did she get down there? Did she fall? Did she jump? How could she make it over the railing? Did someone push her? Who would, where were they, why? All these questions, asked over and over, with no answer in reply. When the paramedics got there they made their way down to the creekbed, struggling to get her body back up so they could place her on a stretcher. When they rolled her to the ambulance my mom couldn’t stand to look any longer, but as I watched her body pass something struck me. Both of her ears were mutilated. Torn to ribbons, and caked in blood.

I drove my mom to the hospital the next day. I figured she didn’t need to be there that night only to be told what we already knew, she didn’t need that. At least, I assumed so. She still hadn’t spoken a word to me. We went to the hospital’s morgue to view the body, and whatever details hadn’t sunk in the night before assailed our eyes then. Her right shoulder was fully dislocated, the arm barely attached to the torso. Her eyes were flooded red, her nose caved in. Her ears were reduced to shreds of hanging cartilage. It is a terrible unkindness to see a loved one like that. She had such a kind face, but now when I think of her I am always greeted with the memory of that examination table. That is the first thing I ever see. Not her smile, or her laugh, or her silky white hair. I see a face subjected to violence, the ruin of a kind woman.

The morgue attendant on staff at the time told us a final autopsy report wouldn’t be available for at least a month. I asked him if he could tell us anything yet, and he answered, “currently, our first judgment is that she fell. Given her age, a fall from that height would likely be lethal.” I forgave his blunt approach, even though I could see talking about it was upsetting my mom. I suppose he had to be used to this. I should’ve just left it there, but felt like I had to ask him. 

“Why do her ears look like that?” He seemed off put by the question, but replied, “well, depending on how she fell, what she fell on, the ears could’ve been damaged that badly by the impact.” At that, my mom had enough, she couldn’t take it anymore. I followed her out of the morgue as she caught her breath. I knew well enough then to hold my tongue and leave it alone, but something about his answer felt wrong. I’m not an autopsy technician, but even to me it looked too symmetrical. Too intentional.

I kept that thought to myself though, there were other concerns to deal with. I was with her as we went through the whole taxing process. We claimed her mother’s body, had it prepared for the funeral, and let my mom’s side of the family know about what happened. Most of them showed up when the service took place in August. A couple had choice words for my mom, blaming her for it all. I did what I could to intervene, but people who are determined to rub salt in the wound like that can be relentless, self-righteous to the very end. The last discernible words exchanged before some of my cousins had to help calm everyone down came from my mom, “where were you when she needed somewhere to stay? What did you ever do for her?” It was bitter, but it was a hard truth. I never said it, but part of me was proud of her for that.

I rarely saw her leave her room for the next week, and when she did not a word sounded from her mouth. I stayed out of the way, helped how I felt I could, but any attempt to check on her was met with little more than a nod, a sigh, or a simple “yes/no” at best. My dad wandered the house as he usually did, seemingly unchanged by the whole ordeal. He’d go through his typical cycle, look out windows, pace in circles, try to open a door with no success. We had to get special locks so that the doors required a key to open from both sides since he’d strayed far from the house one too many times. It helped my mom sleep a bit better.

It wasn’t until the end of August that we started to get back into our routine. She’d join us for dinner, watch movies with me, run errands, talk to me about the future. She started to seem like herself again. So, I decided it would be nice to surprise her with a special dinner. I had cooked for her enough times to know what she loved the most, and I thought she might appreciate it after such a hard month. While she was out of the house I went to the store and bought everything I’d need. Collard greens, bacon-wrapped pork medallions, corn cobs, and potatoes to bake. I still remember that was her favorite.

I almost had it all ready when she got back home, the meat was still on the grill. She walked over, caught a smell and smiled. She gave me a hug, and quietly said “thank you.” I remember that too. My dad was outside with me, as long as I kept an eye on him I figured he could use the fresh air. He was messing around with a bike that had been laying on the front porch, he tended to entertain himself in odd ways. She saw him fiddling with it, and got an idea. She wanted to see if he still remembered how to ride it. She walked him to the end of the carport where it meets the driveway, helped him on, and to our shock he started pedaling. 

He rode like it was second nature, and for a moment it almost felt like nothing had really changed about him. My mom hopped on the other bike and went after him, so he slowed his pace. I saw them go down the road, I could hear her talking to him and laughing as they went side by side. It was one of the strangest joys I’ve ever known, seeing something like that. If I could hold onto that feeling forever, I’d never let it go. It escaped me when they left my sight, and I haven’t felt it since.

Not long after that dinner was ready, so I got it all prepared for when they got back. I plated their food, cut up the meat into small pieces so my dad could chew it easier, set the table, even poured my mom a glass of wine. I waited to eat until they were there to join me, but I started to realize they’d been gone a while. It was already getting dark out and nearly 20 minutes had passed since they first went riding. I quieted my worries, thinking to myself it was a rare gift for my mom and dad to spend good time together like that. If she wanted to savor it, she had every right to. But, more time passed, dinner was getting cold, and still they hadn’t returned.

When the clock read 7:30 my worries couldn’t be suppressed by any rationale, and I went out looking. It all felt gravely familiar as I surveyed the area, flashlight in hand and heart in my throat. I checked around the bridge, but felt some small relief when they weren’t there. After a couple rounds I determined they weren’t near the house, and got in my truck. I slowly drove down the road to search for them, asking what few neighbors we had along the way if they had seen them. No such luck. By then whatever traces of sunlight were left peeking over the horizon gave way to the night, and I could barely see a thing outside the shine of my headlights.

I made my way along until I found myself where our street meets Cameron Street, a long road that spans all the way from north Lafayette to Duson. I still hadn’t seen either of them, but I knew my mom well enough to know they wouldn’t have gone any further. I wanted to keep looking, but I knew I could only cover so much ground by myself. So, I turned around and drove back to our house, desperately hoping I’d find them before I reached it. At this point any effort to remain calm was washed away as a wave of fear crashed down on me. I tried to not give any leeway as all my worst expectations of what could’ve happened rocked me to my core. But, I knew if any of them were true then every minute was critical, and I had no time to waste.

When I passed through the gate and asphalt turned to the gravel of our driveway, I saw a glint of light near the carport. As I inched forward it became clearer what it was, and for the briefest moment I felt all the weight that had accumulated in my chest over the past hour leave me. It was a bike. But, as the beams revealed more with every turn of the wheels that short relief melted back into a crushing realization. There was only one, and my dad was holding onto it, frozen in place. When I parked and got out of the truck he turned around to look as I walked up to him. That’s when the final, grisly detail hit me, stopping my next step. We stood there, still as could be, with glassy eyes staring past. The bike was spotted with blood, and so was he.

When my body could once again manage a motion I walked my dad back inside, and tried all I could to get him to talk to me. “Where’s mom? Where did you last see her? Dad, please, I need to know where mom is. Did she get hurt? Where is she?” Nothing. He was usually nonverbal, so getting him to talk in general wasn’t easy. But, this was different. He barely seemed to even acknowledge what I was saying, his lips quivered but never opened to try and form a reply. His eyes were distant, open wide, barely blinking. He was terrified.

I called the police to report my mom was missing, Scott’s a small town so they didn’t take too long to get there. While we waited I tended to him, continually trying to see if he would talk. I changed his clothes, and tried to get him to eat. Not a bite.  When they arrived I explained the situation as best as I could, still wrecked with worry. I showed them a picture of her. The tears finally came when I saw it. They assured me they’d find her. Over and over again, “we’ll find her.” I offered to help but I suppose my state betrayed any guise of being able to handle that, as they told me I should stay and watch after my dad. When two other cars arrived they searched the area, patrolling the property, the road, the fields and houses that dotted either side of it. Minutes turned to hours before I heard a knock at the door after a taste of eternity.

It took another knock to shake me from my stupor, I rose and rushed to the door. The chance that she was okay, safe and intact, was all I hoped for with every step. I’ve never wanted something so much. But, when I turned the knob and pulled the door inward, only the grim face of a police officer filled our doorway. “We’ve looked all over the property, the woods, and we checked with all your neighbors. I’m sorry son, but there’s no sign of her yet.” He reached into his pocket, and pulled out the picture I had given him. “We’ll take this back to the station tonight and get missing persons to work on getting in touch with local news. In the meantime, we’ll send some officers out tomorrow morning to expand the search area.”

I couldn’t form any kind of response, the sting of my dashed hopes still too fresh to let me say a thing. He could tell how rattled I was. “I really am sorry, we’ve done what we can for tonight. Before we leave, I need to know that you’ll be safe. Stay here, keep the doors locked, and please don’t go out looking in the dark. Will you do that for me?” I nodded, still unable to speak. “Okay. Try and get some rest, we’ll find her.” One last repetition. “If we find anythi- if we find her, we’ll let you know straight away. Good night.” I could tell as he said that it was out of habit, not thinking about what kind of night I had ahead of me. I said it back as a reflex, and closed the door. Curled up on the floor, back against the wood, I lost any composure that had held me back. My will was broken, and a hurricane came raging out. Snot, spit, and tears flowed from a shuddering mess of a man, helpless. I cried myself dry.

It was only after my eyes couldn’t spare another drop that I finally looked up to see my dad standing in front of me, looking down. That same look was on his face. His hands were shaking. I don’t know if anything else could have gotten me to lift myself up off the ground quicker than the thought that, even if he couldn’t say it, even if he didn’t really know it, my dad was just as scared as I was. So, I tried to do what I thought my mom would want me to, and took care of him. He still wouldn’t eat, but I at least got him to drink some water. I walked him to their room, took off his shoes, and tucked him into bed.

After I pulled the comforter over him, I saw him lying there, staring at the ceiling. I hoped he could sleep. I hoped he could forget. He had lost his anchor, his one consistency. She was the only thing he could latch onto, and she was gone. I couldn’t look at him any longer. Whatever strength my mother had, whatever will kept her from caving in, I don’t have it. In his face I only saw my own weakness reflected back at me. As I turned to leave him in that room, alone, I didn’t know what else to say. “I’m sorry dad.”

That's all I can stomach right now. If I'm still a free man, I'll tell the rest when I can. I'm gonna try to get some sleep, I've got a long shift tonight. They're always long shifts.
