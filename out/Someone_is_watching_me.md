My name is William Anderson and it is with a sound mind that I can say, despite what the doctors think, that I am not insane. I guess I should explain more for you to understand.
Like stated my name is William Anderson. I was born December 7th, 1990. I went to college and finished with a bachelor of science in nursing. The idea of being a doctor never really clicked with me but I still wanted to work in that kind of environment, so nursing was the next step down. I got a job not long after college at the local urgent care and that’s where I worked for about 11 years, until recently. What you’re about to read is my best recollection of the events that transpired over the past two months and I hope that when you’re done you will agree with my statement from before, I’m not insane. 


The urgent care I worked in didn’t really get a lot of people in there regularly. The town I live in is pretty small so most of the time it was usually the same few that came in. Older patients and the occasional visit from parents after they kid gets a sprain or breaks something. It was a very rare occurrence to every get someone we didn’t know in the place. Mostly it was truckers riding by that didn’t fell up to par, the road trippers that needed directions and then there was him. 


It was about 1 am when he came in. I was putting some patient information in the computer when a man came up to the desk. The best way I could describe him was that he looked boring. I don’t mean that in a rude way, I mean he looked like the most basic man you can think of. If you were to think of a man off the top of your head you would probably imagine a guy that looked like him. Brown hair, brown eyes, he didn’t have a single noticeable thing about him. He was average height, maybe 50 years old. I say maybe because I never got the chance to ask him. Almost immediately after he walked up to the desk he fell over, and immediately after he fell over he started to convulse. I quickly got over to him and called for someone to help me stabilize him and for someone else to call 911. At urgent care we treated non-life-threatening illnesses, so when someone starts to convulse and turn blue in the middle of the lobby we aren’t really accommodated for treat that. 


It was 1:19 am when the ambulance showed up but it was too late. He had died about 6 minutes before they came. Luckily for us the lobby was empty when this all happened. Unluckily for us we all had to experience it. The best way I would describe the feeling of the place afterwards would be stagnant, like the air in the building was staying still for us to really sink in what happened. We tried to carry on like normal after everything transpired. A few of the younger workers left early because of it while I stayed the rest of my shift to fill out all the needed forms to document what happened. Although it’s not normal for something like that to happen, it’s also not impossible for someone to die in urgent care. I figured that I just got the short stick in life and was one of the unfortunate few to experience such a thing, but that life would move on like normal afterwards. I was wrong.


It wasn’t until 4 days after that I started to notice little things. I would feel like someone was watching me from corners or that I was being followed when walking on the street. I caught myself a few times rounding a corner and almost waiting for something to just pop out from behind the wall, ready to strike me down. I chalked it up to nerves but it really started to freak me out when I would experience it at home. I live in a pretty decent area of town in a quiet neighborhood, so it really was strange when I would feel like someone was trying to peak into my windows and catch a glimpse of me. This feeling of unease kept up for about a week until the climax of it finally came to turn one night. 


It was about 1 am when it happened, almost 15 days after the stranger had died at my work. I had taken a few days off for some personal issues, so I was being a responsible adult and staying up past my normal bed time. I was sitting in the living room on my phone while some show I had put on played on the tv when I heard something. I had thought the sound came from the show but then I heard it again, this time louder and more distinct. I muted the tv and waited for it to happen again, and when it did it sounded almost like glass being knocked on. My first instinct was to check the front windows but as I was making my way to them I heard it again, this time behind me. I turned to look at the kitchen window when I saw something pass by it outside. Unfortunately the light of the living room glared on the window so all I could see was a black blur. So like an idiot I turned them off, trying to get my eyes to adjust to the moonlight that started to shine in from outside.


 I had hoped it would make it easier to see out the windows and maybe catch who was doing this. I almost immediately regretted my decision cause as soon as I could see out of them I noticed a figure pressing they face against my back door. I almost jumped out of my skin and let out what I believe to be the loudest scream I have ever made. I just stood in my living room as still as I could, staring at the figure. They had their hands over their eyes as to see better inside which just made the image more frightening. They body was hunched over and I could see them adjusting they position as to get a better view. I just stood still and slowly tried to get my phone from the couches arm rest and as I was about to grab it that’s when I noticed it. They were staring right at me. They arms were at they sides and they forehead was pressed right against the glass. I could feel they gaze peering directly into me as I just stared right back at them.


Without wasting anymore time I grabbed my phone and ran to the front door. I could hear the handle of the back door shaking as the figure started to bang on it. I was running out of the house as I heard the doors glass frame shatter. I didn’t bother to look, I just slammed the door behind me and ran to my neighbors. I was lucky enough for them to be home and was able to have them call the police for me, as I had become an incoherent mess. The police checked my whole house and besides the broken back door they said they could find no signs that another person was ever in my house. Did they think it just smashed the door and walked away? I told them I heard it come towards me after it broke in but they said it wasn’t enough evidence to push it any further.


I ended up staying with a friend for a while after cause I just knew something was wrong. No one just goes to a persons back door to break it and leave. I soon found out that my suspicions were right, I was still being watched. I could feel eyes on me at almost every second of the day, but it wasn’t the normal side glances people give you on the street. No, this was a hateful stare coming from one specific person. I would start to freak out at the smallest things. People bumping into me, the sound of things falling, but it all started to come to ahead one day at work.


It had been about 20 days since the stranger had died at my work. The image of him falling over in front of me would reply in my head every time someone came up to check in. I ended up moving to the back and just did some busy work cause it was getting too much for me. I was filling out some checklist for supplies when it hit me, I was being watched.


 I did about 5 360’s to check around me, just spinning in a circle to try and catch a glimpse of someone, anyone that might had been there. I grabbed a nearby wall to catch my balance when I finally spotted them. Standing, right in the middle of the hallway was him. He almost looked like a shadow, draped in darkness so I couldn’t see any noticeable things about him. I think we stood like that for about 10 minutes before he finally took a step towards me. I didn’t waste anytime, I turned and ran the other way. I was praying, pleading for someone else to show up and help me. But no one did, it was if the entire building was empty. The hallways felt like they were stretching, what should have been a 20 second walk to another room had turned into a 5 mile sprint. Every time I turned around he was right there, just staring at me.

After what felt like miles I finally reached a room. I slammed the door behind me and backed away, staring at the knob of it. I looked for anything to use in the room to defend myself when I heard the doorknob shaking. I started to hyperventilate, my head spinning as I watched it shake more and more violently. I slowly moved into a corner and slide down, staring at the door. 
As the door slammed open I just started to scream.
“GET THE FUCK AWAY! GET AWAY, I DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME!”
I felt a pair of hands grab my arms and start to squeeze them before a calm voice filled my ears.
“William! Calm down, it’s ok. No one is here.”
I opened my eyes to one of my coworkers right in front of me, the rest of them standing by the door terrified. I felt my eyes fill with tears as I clung onto them, feeling myself breakdown.


I didn’t know what was happening. I wasn’t even sure if it was real but I know that it wasn’t safe for me to be around people while I was like this. I went to my boss and told him I was quitting. He knew what happened and was understanding, telling me that if I wanted to I could come back after things calmed down. But I knew they wouldn’t, not until I figured out who was following me and what they wanted. I stayed in my house for the next few days after I quit. I knew that guy would come back for me and I was ready to find out who he was.


It had been a month since the stranger died at my work. I was a mess, I had spent all the time sitting in the living room. I was just waiting for him to show up. It was around 1 am again when I heard the knocking on the glass. I immediately turned to the back door and stared at it. Watching the shadowed figure hunched over like that made me realize that maybe I was going crazy. I could have sworn that he looked almost, boring. Like he had no real noticeable thing about him. My eyes just grew when I realized what was happening, when I realized who was at my back door. I walked to the door, pointing and yelling at him.
“I-It’s you…Your the man from my work. 
You should be dead…WHY THE FUCK AREN’T YOU DEAD!?” 
He just looked at me and I could see his brown eyes stare into my soul. I banged on the door and backed away from it. 


I thought I was going insane, a dead man was at my backdoor and I was going insane. Then I watched as a rock flew through my backdoor, glass shattering along the kitchen floor. I quickly grabbed a knife from a drawer and pointed it at the man.
“Just leave me the hell alone. I didn’t do anything to you, WHY WONT YOU LEAVE ME ALONE!?”
I screamed at him, but all he did was slowly make his way towards me. I didn’t know what to do, so I just ran at him. I ran at him and tackled him to the ground. I could feel the decaying skin and clothes underneath me as I raised the knife above my head and brought it down into his chest as I screamed at him. I just kept stabbing and stabbing and stabbing until I could feel the knife hit the floor beneath him. I was covered in blood and dirt and filth, my hands were shaking and my heart was beating a mile a minute until I heard a bang on my front door. I turned to see it burst open and two police officer came in.


That was about a month ago. Iv been in the psych ward since the officers brought me in that night. I have explained what happened to plenty of people and none of them believe a word I say. Doesn’t help that the body wasn’t even there when they arrived that night, just me covered in blood and filth and slamming a knife into the ground. Hell, they can’t even figure out whose blood it was. I hear a few of the doctors and nurses say I’m probably suffering from some kind of mental insanity but I know I’m not. I know that everything that happened was true and that I was being followed by that man I saw die a month before. I know he’s not fully dead yet too, because sometimes when I sit outside in the garden of the ward I get this strange feeling. 


It’s as if I’m being watched.
