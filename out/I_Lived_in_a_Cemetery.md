The events I’m about to relate happened while my son (whom I’ll call “Luke”) was still little. For years, even after we moved into an actual neighborhood, with other children, and a real yard he could play in without seeing gravestones, he would still wake up screaming and crying, recounting nightmares in his limited child’s vocabulary that chilled me to the bone. Sometimes, even after I came in and turned on the light, he would look around the room, eyes wide and glassy, as if still fixated on something horrifying, something that wasn’t there. The doctor called these episodes “night terrors.” I would comfort Luke as best I could, let him sleep in my bed, and even though my wife died when he was just an infant, he would still sleep in the middle of the bed, pressed up against me, as though she was still on her now empty side of the mattress. 

And when I inevitably awoke later, drenched in sweat, from my *own* nightmares - or memories, maybe; the line between them has admittedly blurred over these years - I would bite my lip to keep myself from crying out, waking him up, scaring him. After Luke’s mother died, he was my world. Still is, even though he’s older now, more independent, with his own friends and his own life. 

Years of keeping these things to yourself weighs on you, erodes your mental health. I couldn’t talk to Luke about it because I didn’t want to frighten him. I couldn’t talk to any of my friends about it because, beyond just being laughed at or disbelieved, I was concerned word would get out that I was unstable and my son would get taken away from me. Stories got passed around about the cemetery, of course (and they still are, as far as I know), but who really takes local legends like that seriously? So I buried everything, deep down; I drank too much, smoked too much, changed careers and tried to forget about it, but how do you forget something that shakes the very foundations of your worldview, and everything you took for granted? So finally, I decided I had to get it off my chest, even if it’s just shouting into the void of the internet, and even if no one believes me. 

So, whoever you are, let me tell you about the weeks that my son and I spent living in a cemetery.

It was early fall, going on a decade ago now, when I saw the classified ad: Live-in Cemetery Groundskeeper. Room and Board provided. Maccabees Memorial Garden, \[address redacted.\]

Not a moment too soon - I’d been sleeping on my sister’s couch for a month while Luke and his cousin shared a room. My back couldn’t take much more of it. I went to drop off my resume after taking Luke to kindergarten, and got to talking with Lily, the kindly old lady in the administrative office, the both of us raising our voices over the din of the construction equipment rumbling just outside the west gate. Their previous caretaker had left rather suddenly, she explained, leaving them in dire need of a quick replacement. Living on-site wasn’t a requirement, she mentioned, but it was encouraged due to the size of the property, and they did have quarters available. By the time I had to leave, she’d offered me the job and given me a brief tour. 

The cemetery was old and sprawling, divided from the world of the living by a heavy iron fence, with gates on the south, east, and west sides, though the road leading to the west gate was long defunct and overgrown. Paved roads wound through rolling hills packed with headstones bearing names and dates going all the way back to the 18th century. Near the office stood what I knew from my previous cemetery work was called a “columbarium,” or a structure where urns were stored, while the private mausoleums were mostly concentrated near the western side of the property, near the oldest burials, surrounded with sandstone markers worn away by centuries. Many of them bore carvings of sleeping lambs, which, in the olden days, indicated the resting place of a child.

The house we’d be staying in was on the grounds, on a hill far back in the cemetery, separated a little ways from the burial plots. It was larger than I had expected - two stories tall, two bedrooms. It even had a porch with a swinging bench. I had reservations about bringing my son to live in a cemetery, of course I did, but they were outweighed by the prospect of actually having a house of our own. We didn’t have to live there forever, either, I told myself - just long enough for us to get back on our feet, to save up enough to afford somewhere else. 

Besides, I was a practical man. I didn’t believe in ghosts, or spirits, or monsters, other than the human kind, of course - the sort that had taken our house after I was laid off from my last job, for instance. And anyway, Luke was too young to even understand what a cemetery truly was. It wouldn’t make much difference to him. I was more worried about the grinding, buzzing, rumbling, and clanking of the construction site just past the fence - building a new road and a park in the woods, Lily had said. I just hoped they wouldn’t start too early in the morning.

A week later, we were moving in. I got settled in the master bedroom, on the west side of the house, and - just my luck, of course - there was a window overlooking the woods, and the construction site, perfect for all the noise to come straight in. Luke played in his bedroom down the hall while I worked, putting up some of the framed photos that had been packed away during our stay with my sister. For once, I warmed at seeing Rose’s smile, without lingering on how she looked in those final weeks as she suffered the final stages of her disease, as the cancer ate her from the inside out. Something about having a new house of our own, away from the place she had slowly and agonizingly slipped away, dulled the sharp pain I’d felt every time I reminisced about her for the past year. It would take some getting used to, seeing graves from my bedroom, but it was nice feeling like we had a home again. 

The sun was beginning to set, and I was putting fresh sheets on my bed when the doorbell rang.

*Ding dong.*

*Must be Lily dropping by to see how we’re doing,* I thought, heading downstairs. But when I opened the door, there was nobody there. The porch swing creaked lightly in the autumn breeze. Gravestones dotted the hillside just beyond the little patch of land that served as our new yard. From my vantage point, I could see a hearse entering the north gate, with a small procession of cars behind. 

I walked out into the yard and glanced around each side of the house. Nothing. Nobody there at all.

The leaves of the nearby weeping willows rustled gently.

I furrowed my brows and went back inside. *Probably old wiring*, I thought. I made a note to take a look the next day. I was the groundskeeper, now, after all.

Later that night I was tucking Luke into bed and asked if he liked his new room. He grinned and nodded, snuggling up to Simon (his stuffed cat), and I felt some of the layer of ice that had formed around my heart over the previous year begin to melt, just a little bit. I became slightly more confident that I’d made the right choice for both of us.

“Good.” I ruffled his hair and switched the light off. “Sleep tight, buddy.”

Back in my own room before bed, I found myself staring out the window. The old sandstone and marble headstones clustered near the west fence of the cemetery practically glowed in the pale light of the full moon. My eyes scanned the treeline just beyond. I could hear my own breath, could feel my heart thudding in my temple. I pressed my teeth together. I felt inexplicably tense, like I was waiting for something to happen, though I couldn’t say what that was. 

Then I noticed them. A pair of eyes in the woods, reflecting the moonlight like a cat’s in the dark. They looked up at the house. Then another pair flickered into view beside them. And another. Greenish white. Shining and empty. I stood rooted in place, my pulse pounding. What did those eyes belong to? They were bigger than cats. Bigger than raccoons or deer. They began drifting towards the cemetery fence, towards the house, approaching–

My eyes blinked open. Had I fallen asleep? I didn’t even remember laying down. For a moment I didn’t know what had roused me. There was a sound, distant, but urgent. I shook off the drowsiness and focused in on it to realize it was my son. 

He was screaming.



I scrambled out of bed and ran down the hall, disoriented in the new house. Luke’s voice was beyond frightened. It was pure desperate panic. I threw open the door to find him staring at his closet, eyes wide as he shrieked his throat raw.

I threw the lightswitch, hurried over, and scooped him up into my arms. “What’s going on? What’s wrong?” I asked, stroking his hair. Slowly, Luke calmed down, but he wouldn’t take his eyes off the closet. 

“There was a man in there,” he said, pointing. “He didn’t have a head.”

My stomach surged, despite myself, my practicality. I glanced in the closet, seeing nothing but the few boxes we’d stacked there earlier in the day, and quickly slid the door shut. I was almost certain I had closed it before tucking Luke in, but I convinced myself that, after the long day of moving, I must have been misremembering. 

“It was just a bad dream,” I told him, laying him back down, gently. “It’s alright. You’re safe. Go back to sleep.” But when I stood up to leave, Luke started to whimper.

“Can I sleep with you, daddy?”

I sighed. I loved spending time with him, but when he was in my room, he had a tendency to want to stay up and chat and play, meaning neither of us slept well. He had school in the morning, and I had to get up early for my first real day of work, so it wasn’t ideal. But it was a new house, and he was absolutely terrified.

Of course, I tried to convince myself that wanting him in the room had nothing to do with the unease I now felt creeping through me.

“Sure, buddy,” I answered, hoping he’d be too exhausted to get wound up. “Just for tonight.”

\--

After that, the next several weeks mostly went by smoothly. We even got a break from the construction noise, as the workers seemed to have been called to an auxiliary project down the road. Occasionally, though, I noticed odd things - keys wouldn’t be where I’d left them, or I’d find the kitchen cabinets open when Luke was at school and I was sure I had closed them. The doorbell rang several more times with nobody present, and try as I might, I couldn’t find any issue with the wiring or the mechanism. The floors would creak, and though I told myself it was just the boards settling, I could have sworn, more than once, that the sounds had the cadence of somebody walking, purposefully, from one room to another.

The house’s heat seemed to be on the fritz as well; it would often get cold inside, nearly as cold as the outdoor autumn weather sometimes, even with the furnace going. I examined it and, again, couldn’t find any problems. Beginning to doubt my maintenance capabilities, I made a note to call in a specialist to take a look.

By, and large, however, these were minor issues, and I chalked them up to my imagination, the stress of being a single parent affecting my memory, and the age of the house. Luke was coming out of his shell more and making friends. Work was going well. For a couple of days, here and there, I even managed to convince myself that I was finally starting to move on, that I wasn’t missing Rose to death.

\--

It all went downhill in late October. I remember I was woken up early that morning by the once-familiar roaring of the excavators. 

*Back to it,* I remember thinking acidly to myself as I rubbed my eyes and hauled myself downstairs to make coffee.

After dropping Luke off at kindergarten, I got started with the work day. I planted new grass over the site of a previous day’s burial. I trimmed the hedges between the mausoleums and drove around picking up trash. Doing the rounds soon brought me to the old section of the cemetery, near the west gate.

As I climbed out of the cart to grab a wayward plastic bag, I suddenly heard a voice, whispered, insistent.

*"John."*

It seemed to drift to me on the breeze, out from the rustling orange and yellow leaves of the forest.

I frowned. *I'm imagining things,* I thought*.* *It's easy to pick up patterns where there aren’t really-*

*"****John****."*

Louder this time. Above a whisper. 

Unmistakable. 

I looked around. The whole area was deserted. If the cemetery had any visitors, they weren't anywhere in sight. Even the construction equipment at the nearby site was empty, the workers gathering at their cars on their lunch break. I gave myself a quick pinch to make sure I wasn't having another dream, then hurried back to the golf cart. It was only after I started off that I realized I’d forgotten the plastic bag, which blew away, beyond the fence, into the trees.

	

That night, Luke seemed nervous. He couldn’t tell me exactly what was wrong, but he insisted that I leave the light on in his room. As I had started doing every night, I double checked that the closet door was shut tightly, and in my own room, I also made sure the curtains to the window looking out over the woods were drawn. 

A flash of memory came to me: *greenish-white eyes, shining and empty. Bigger than deer or raccoon.* I shuddered.

Like I said before, I didn't believe in ghosts, or spirits, or monsters. But nonetheless, I found it much easier to fall asleep with that view of the woods obscured.



*…creak*.

I jolted up in bed. The clock on my nightstand read 2:23 AM.

My door had just opened.

I was absolutely certain I had closed it before bed. That wasn’t a question, like it had been with Luke’s closet, or the kitchen cabinets. Closing my bedroom door was second nature, an old habit from growing up with an overly-affectionate cat. I couldn’t sleep with it open.

*Thump. Thump thump.* I heard the sound of soft feet shuffling quickly down the hall.

*Crash.*

I sprang out of bed and ran down the stairs two at a time. I flipped on the kitchen light to see Luke standing next to the counter. A broken glass was at his feet. I guessed he'd knocked it off the table in the dark. I felt a wave of relief - what had I expected to see, anyway? 

"Daddy?"

"Luke? What are you doing up?"

"I heard you down here," he said sleepily. “You were saying my name.”

I felt my stomach sink. My throat tightened.

"You were dreaming," I said, much more confidently than I felt. "Let's go back to bed."

I remembered the voice calling me from the woods. "*John. John…"*

"I'll tell you what,” I told Luke, “you can sleep in my bed again tonight."

We went back upstairs and settled in.



But I wasn't asleep for long. The second time I awoke that night, moonlight was streaming through the window.

The curtains were open.

I rubbed my eyes. Everything was blurry. Something was casting a long shadow across the bed. 

"Luke?" I muttered. But I glanced over and saw that Luke was sleeping soundly next to me, his breathing steady and even.

A smell drifted over to me, then. I felt my stomach churn. Mold and soil. Musty decaying leaves. I followed the shadow and looked up just in time to see a vague form quickly shuffle out of the room. 

I felt myself sit up and climb out of bed, drawn along as though a passenger in my own body. There was no belief, nor disbelief, only a void, the padding of my bare feet on the wood floor, the surging of adrenaline. 

I was wide awake. I know I was.

*Thump. Thump. Thump.* Something hurried down the stairs ahead of me. Rounding the corner, I caught a shadow disappearing into the kitchen. One step at a time I descended, following numbly, and as I emerged out onto the ground level, my heart shuddered in my chest, sending tremors through my veins.

Surrounding the windows in the kitchen and living room, silhouetted in the pale light of the moon, were shadowy, skeletal forms, watching without seeing, rags hanging off them gently swaying in the night air. The front door hung open, its hinges creaking with every draft. I drifted over to it like a ghost and peered out the screen door.

Across the yard, moving west, was a figure like the others, clad in decaying tatters. It had no head on its shoulders. As I stepped out onto the porch, it stopped near the west gate, turned towards me, lifted a shriveled hand, and beckoned. The gate, usually secured with chains and locks, was now hanging open, leading to the disused and overgrown road into the woods.  Like a puppet on strings, still barefoot, dressed in my bedclothes, I stumbled down the steps, across the grass, through the graves, and towards the treeline; in a panic, I thought of Luke alone in the house, but nonetheless I continued on, helpless as a man possessed. As I neared, the headless figure turned and quickly vanished through the gate and into the dark woods, near the construction equipment. And as I looked on I saw eyes, dozens of them, glowing, shining pale and white and empty from behind the trees, waiting and watching as I came closer and closer, drawn inexplicably towards the other side of the west gate, where sat the silent trucks and excavators…



I suddenly found myself opening my eyes in bed with a beam of sunlight falling across my face. I could hear Luke in the other room singing to himself, and birds chirping faintly outside the window. I sat up and rubbed my eyes, clearing away the sleep. 

*Why do I keep having these dreams?* I wondered blearily.

I sat up and swung my feet out of bed, and that’s when I felt something odd between my toes. I looked down.

My feet were smeared with dirt.



Like I said before, I was a practical man, and what I told myself, at first, was that I had been sleepwalking. After bringing Luke into school, I tried to get on with my work day. But the more I tried to ignore everything, the more it bothered me. I’d never had trouble sleeping before moving in. And it wasn’t just me - Luke had also seen something in his closet, something that terrified him.

*There was a man in there. He had no head.*

I remembered the headless figure gliding across the cemetery, towards the gate. 

Turning to beckon me.

*What Luke said caused you to dream about a headless man while you were sleepwalking,* I tried to tell myself. But it felt like a hollow excuse. Where would Luke have even gotten the idea of a headless man? I searched for any memory of him watching any scary TV shows with his cousin, or reading any books that might mention such a thing, but I came up empty. “Kids and their imaginations” could only go so far.

*And the alternative is… what? An actual headless man coming in your house?* My rational self said with disdain. *Do you have any idea how crazy that sounds?* 

I did. But I also knew what I’d seen, what I’d felt, what we’d both been experiencing over the last month.



Before I got to the day’s scheduled work, I decided to actually walk down to the west gate and have a look around, just to make sure everything was in order, since the strange happenings seemed mostly centered there. Still trying to convince myself that I wasn’t superstitious, and reminding myself that I’d worked in other cemeteries for years without seeing so much as a flicker of a ghost, I reasoned that it wasn’t just the supernatural I was concerned about. There could be dangerous animals hiding out in the woods, I told myself, or maybe people - teenagers playing pranks, even vandals and thieves. I grabbed the cemetery key ring and headed down the hill. 

Soon, though, I saw I wouldn’t need the keys. The padlock had been unfastened, and the chain lay on the ground. The gate was open, just a crack. 

Just as I had seen it the previous night. 

On the other side, the woods loomed dark and foreboding. Even now, in the broad daylight, I could feel hidden eyes on me from just behind the treeline, watching my every move. The wind whispered through the leaves. I shivered, in spite of myself. 

The construction equipment sat nearby, unused. I thought that was strange; they were usually well into their work day by this point. I stepped out through the gate and made my way carefully over to the site. There was one worker nearby, smoking a cigarette and heading back to the road where his car was parked. I hurried up to him.

“No work today?” I asked breathlessly.

“I guess not,” the man replied. “None of the equipment will start up. Can’t figure out what’s wrong with it. They’re getting a mechanic over to take a look.”

After the construction worker drove off, I walked through the site, past the abandoned diggers standing still and silent in the shadow of the forest, with no idea of what I was looking for. I was about to give up and get to work on the mausoleums when, very suddenly, I felt a presence behind me, oppressive and glowering. There was a soft shuffling behind me, and once again, the stench of rot, of soil and moldering leaves. Ice flooded my chest.

A voice came to me on the fall breeze, a rasping croak, below even a whisper.

*“John.”*

I was frozen in place. My heart raced. 

*“John...”* More forcefully now, it called my name again.

I wouldn’t turn around. I couldn’t.

My pulse thundered in my ears. I thought my heart would explode.

This was not a dream.

*“****We’re here.****”*

Something broke in me then. I turned and bolted for the open gate, but tripped on a pile of debris cleared by the excavators and went down hard in the dirt, rattling my teeth. As I climbed back up to my feet, something caught my eye. Something subtle, really. An unnatural shape in the soil, and a patch of white.

The fall seemed to have shaken me out of my panic. The voice was gone now and I was alone. All that remained was the gentle autumn breeze. I crouched down and carefully brushed away the soil.

The empty sockets of a human skull stared up at me from the dirt. I stumbled backward, ran towards the house, and called the police.

\---

After the proper reports were made, the paperwork filled out, and a more complete investigation done, a clearer picture began to emerge. Over two dozen unmarked graves were uncovered on the other side of the cemetery’s west fence and in the nearby woods - a potter’s field over two hundred years old, forgotten over the decades, then cut off from the main grounds when the heavy iron gates were erected at the turn of the century. Since there was no documentation of them, the construction project had bulldozed right through their resting places. The remains were moved, reburied in the main cemetery, and given new markers - “Known Only to God.” Then the park and the road were built, and that was that.

Well, almost. 

The rest of the body belonging to the skull that I found in the dirt that day was never located. And there's a story the kids around here tell: that if you pass down the road next to Maccabee’s Memorial Garden, between the west gate and the woods, on a dark autumn night, you might see a figure in the shadows, and if you look closely, you may find that he has no head.

I’m not sure how true that is. I gave my notice the very same day I uncovered the bones. Luke and I were gone within a week, moved back in with my sister. I didn’t mind the couch so much this time around, and Luke had a much easier time sharing his room with his cousin than with… whatever it was he’d seen in his closet at the house.

What I did mind was the nightmares. Every time I closed my eyes after that, for months, I was right back at the construction site, standing there shaking uncontrollably, sensing something standing behind me, smelling the must, the leaves, the soil, the rot. I knew I had been led there by something fundamentally *wrong*, something that was dead, something that should not be able to walk, to talk, to move, and yet *did*. I was crouching, seeing those empty eye sockets staring back at me, what had once been a person, with a whole life, with dreams and loved ones, now forgotten, abandoned to nameless decay, crying out for recognition from beyond the grave.

The nightmares started a period of exploration; I read books on the afterlife and near death experiences, and even went to church a few times, trying to reclaim the Catholicism of my youth; while I ended up falling out of it again for various reasons I won’t go into, I am now certain - death is not the end.

But it should be. 

The dead must be given their peace, their rest. Without it, they will wander the earth, stinking and wretched, desperate for recognition, for connection, for closure.

I haven't set foot near the cemetery since the day we moved out, and I plan to keep it that way. And my advice, if you see an ad for a live-in cemetery caretaker… keep on looking.
