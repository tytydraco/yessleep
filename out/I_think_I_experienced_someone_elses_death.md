THIS IS NOT FICTION I AM BEING SO DEADASS RIGHT NOW. 
So I live in a very old, haunted house. You pause the tv and once you turn your back it’s playing again, I’ve walked in on my mortar and pestle grinding randomly, a black dog with red eyes sitting in a corner, hearing footsteps, voices, weird opera music ect. 

My boyfriend and his mother lived there when he was a child (he’s 20 now) and he recalls hearing his name being called yet no one’s there. Doors randomly opening, shit like that. 

So anyways, we’ve lived here a year and don’t really mind the entity in the house it’s just kinda annoying. But one night I took a bunch of edibles (way too many) and go to sleep. 
At around 4-5 in the morning I wake up hunched over in my bed as if I was leaning on something but nothing was there. I couldn’t move, something was moving my arms and head for me. I see other people in the room with me but not like physically see them, I’ve hallucinated as a child and this was nothing like that; it was as if I was looking through a lens or something. I could see them in my mind but I knew they weren’t actually in the room with me. 
A huge man has his back turned to me and is beating the shit out of someone on the ground. After he kills them he turns to me (I can still see his big beard with a red flannel on) he starts strangling me. 
I could barely breath and then somehow I get an image of my throat almost completely closed. I hear a voice in my head asking me why am I scared to die? Reminding me that death isn’t something to fear, as if I had already experienced it before. 
Next all I see if a dark cave like tunnel with vines and little cherubs, with a bright light at the very end. I had a weird vibration go down  the middle of my body from head to toe. I wanted to walk out of the tunnel into the light but something pulled me to the side and then I snapped out of it, freaking out I try to wake my boyfriend up telling him that I might be tripping off of edibles. He’s high as hell too so he tells me to go to bed. 

I get up and start walking to the bathroom, I could barely walk, felt like I was seizing, my whole body was convulsing and every step hurt. My eyes are red and bulging, it hurt to drink water.  
My neck physically hurt to touch for over a week and my whole body hurt for a few days. I still get these weird tremors and my body is shaking somehow. 

I told my boyfriends mother about it and she freaked because when she lived there apparently she had nightmares all the time of her being strangled by some man. 

Ever since then I haven’t been scared of death death because I feel like I’ve already experienced it. The pain and stress suddenly turns to a abyss of sweet nothing. A good feeling tho. Sometimes I crave it. 
Idk if it was sleep paralysis or something worse. 
I asked someone who studies witchcraft and she believe that since I was in such a deep state of relaxation I somehow astral projected. I don’t know what happened but i do know i will never be the same. 
If you’ve experienced something similar please tell me.
