Our job was pretty underwhelming, we went into the jungles of central America and surveyed the land to find worthy candidates for mining, deforestation or potential infrastructure. We had to know every boring mathematical detail of the land. Wildlife density, rainfall, even the geology of the land. So, imagine the look on both me and my team when we discovered a large Temple looking to date back to the Aztec empire. I flipped through the briefing on the land provided by flying surveyors and other first recon procedures.

Nothing in these notes suggests civilization of any kind exists out here, not even an isolated tribe and there was no mention of a temple. The temple was, however, located in the center of a clearing in the jungle so it would be the ideal place for us to set up our encampment. Throughout the night we inspected the temple for any signs it would collapse on us and upon learning the structure was stable, we laid down for some rest. The next day my men began racing each other to the top and I thought it would be a good way to get a view of the jungle. The sunrise over the jungle was stunning, but it didn’t make up for the horrors that would befall me during my time there.

The first two weeks were us uneventfully doing our job, with three days travel back to HQ where we gave them all the nitty gritty facts about the land. We then mentioned the temple and how we would have liked to study it further and requested both a language specialist and an archeological team. Fascinated by this anomaly and thinking there may still been Aztec wealth inside; they funded the program, and we would head out to the site within the next two weeks. They asked me if my men or I had gone inside, but we hadn’t for fear it was trapped, cursed or had bad internal infrastructure.

As the one who discovered the anomaly, they wanted me on the team and to this day I wish I would have refused, but I wanted to be a part of one of the biggest archaeological discoveries of all time. A remote temple preserved in time and seemingly untouched. I was naïve and foolish and couldn’t wait to get to the Site while riding with the archeological team. Finally, we arrived and there it stood at the exact same coordinates as before, I was a little anxious we would get there, and it would have magically disappeared.

When we got to the temple (having to make the rest of the three-hour trip on foot due to dense jungle) there was still enough sunlight to get a camp set up and plan how we were going to handle excavating the area. My job was to report progress to HQ and see to the collecting of any records that had to do with the surrounding land. Just as I feel asleep the crack of dawn lit the sky and the men and women began setting up equipment as they readied their first voyage into the temple.

The Monolith stood gaping open with no gates or doors. We took our powered flashlights and shinned them down the corridor that went into a large chamber.

We noticed the walls had some symbols on them and shot photos for the translation specialist. The foyer itself was huge, a large empty room with only a stage and altar at the very end.

At first, we feared this meant looters or other explorers may have gotten here first, or the residents didn’t leave much when they did leave. We all spread out searching the room and upon the altar we saw a book, bound in some kind of leather, most likely human flesh. It had a red gem in the center and weighed heavier than a normal book. We sent it off to be studied by the linguist and Aztec historian on our team and continued our search through the monolith. We went up the stairs and that’s when we saw something that really disturbed us. The room was full of cages and a single urn at the end of the room. The walls weren’t painted with symbols but instead mummified bodies.

I could feel the unease coming off the others and eventually we went back downstairs into the main foyer where we saw another hallway leading down further beneath the temple. We went down, and down, and down until we felt like we were at the core of the earth and at the end of another hallway we could see it, A large stone door that stopped us from advancing any further. By the time we went back up to report our findings it was nighttime.

“Boss we got a problem.”

One of the workers said to the head of the team.

“What problem would that be?”

“It’s Perry, he’s had his face in that book for hours, he hasn’t eaten or used the bathroom or anything like that.”

Perry was the main linguist and while the head of the team didn’t see a problem with him passionately doing his job, he decided to ask about the book himself. When the three of us went into the tent Perry had collapsed, most likely due to heat stroke. We got him medical attention with a medical specialist we had on hand and administered an emergency I.V for fluids and then we were told that we would know more about him the next day. That night I didn’t sleep easy, to many thoughts about the door, the cages and waking up to the men and women of the team screaming like they had been shot. Their cries were loud enough to drown out the sounds of wildlife which in the jungle is no easy feat.

After everyone calmed down, most said they had a nightmare about a giant door opening and something malevolent Devouring them, others said they had nightmares about being put in cages and sacrificed to an Aztec Deity. I was shaken, some of these guys never went into the temple and only the head archeologist, one other guy with a light and myself saw the door below. The next day we visited Perry he too looked like something had shaken him to his core.

“Perry what was in that book.”

“Truth.”

“I’m sorry what?”

“About what lies below, we need to get out of here.”

“Perry what the hell are you talking about?”

I couldn’t really tell what he was saying, it was something in Nahuatl, the primary language of the Aztecs, but it translated to “The Devourer of the Depths.” We researched a little more into the temple and managed to find something big. Hidden in a compartment were scriptures that, if translated, could shed some light on what this place was. We had Perry take care of that instead of focusing on the book and upon Reading he explained that it detailed the history of the organization that ran this temple. The translation wasn’t 100% correct but we decoded the following.

A Cult known as “the way of scales and feathers.” Being exiled from Tenochtitlan (the main city of the Aztec Empire.) Being branded extremist and needing blood for the serpent. Finally, the message. “We love the serpent, and the serpent loves us.” served as the closing remark.

We hadn’t found any treasure or any reason to stay and instead talked about getting out of here as fast as we could. The head of research agreed with this notion although HQ wouldn’t be happy about it, but the only unanswered question we had was the mysterious door that we all agreed would be better left closed. That’s when Perry’s eyes grew wide. “It’s starting to call to us, the gathering has begun!” He then got up and walked into the temple and that’s when we noticed that the camp was empty, only our medical professional remained.

We asked her what happened, and she said the crew all stopped working in unison and then began chanting as they walked into the temple. we ran into the main entrance and saw many of our men and women kneeled on the floor facing the altar repeating the phrase, “we love the serpent, and the serpent loves us.” I tried to shake them out of their trance, but they seemed fervent. That’s when we saw some of them get up and walk up the altar where they took whatever sharp object they could find and slit their own throat while the others continued to chant.

We then ran upstairs and found our historian with his wrist opened draining blood into the urn. “Take it…to the altar.” he said with his last breath as the urn overflowed with crimson blood. I pulled away, no way this was happening! What was even happening?! I couldn’t think straight as my mind filled with visions of monoliths and a colossal snake with feathers crushing the world in its coils. I threw up, my world spun around and that’s when I noticed the head of our team wasn’t with me anymore and neither was the urn. I ran downstairs and saw him pour the urn into a font of sorts behind the altar. The chanting stopped, a there was a moment of silence where I tried to reach Him asking him what he was doing, he turned to face me.

“We love the serpent, and the serpent loves us.”

I was in so much fear that my fight or flight response kicked in and I flew the hell out of there.

The ground beneath my feet began to shake, I ran, and ran until I couldn’t feel the rumbling or even my own feet for that matter. By the time I reached the car I was exhausted, hurting and through all of it I cried. I tried to push it all out of my head, the temple, the door, the book and every last person I left behind there.

Upon getting back to HQ I told them that there was indeed an indigenous tribe living there and they attacked our men in the middle of the night killing all but a few and scattering the rest of us. I don’t know what they did with the case after that, but I told them that they should never return to that temple or section of central America ever again. And hopefully I won’t live long enough to see whatever was behind that door, escape.
