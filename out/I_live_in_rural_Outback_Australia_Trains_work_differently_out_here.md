Rural Australia is a strange place. Most of it is just red desert. Sometimes you’ll come across a town or two. I live in one of these towns. Population? About 70 on a good day. Our only connection use to be the Trans-Australian Railway. Ran straight through this town. However, they diverted the track about 15 years ago now during an overhaul. Runs far away past us now. Quicker too. Luckily we have a road now, so supplies usually come in though trucks now.

The track still lies in the middle of the town. Cutting through it down the middle. The government never actually bothered to pull it up. It’s rusty rails stretch from horizon to horizon. Hasn’t been run on in years.

So they say.

During the construction of this particular bit back in 1916-17 ish, the Aboriginals who lived on the land said that if they continued, started operating, it would never stop. The white men ignored them, as was common for the time. Completed in 1917, started operating. Weird things began happening however. Passengers would tell newspapers they swear they saw long, dark things gliding next to the trains at night. Or belongings and whatnot mysteriously either disappearing forever or showing up days later charred and burned. A train even derailed once. Killed 8 people, injured 20. They say the cause was a blockage on the rails, but survivors on the train that night swear something big impacted the locomotive up front. Checks out too. The locomotive, which was reported to only suffer minor damage, was taken out of service and deemed ‘too damaged to continue working’.

Nothing specific ever happened to this town, but sometimes, unscheduled trains would pass through. They would always feel off. The whole town would go silent and listen when these trains would pass. The horn would always sound like someone doing a really good impression of one, and the rails grinding under the wheels would sound more like hissing than sparks.

Apart from all of these, life would go on usually normally. I have a job working at a repair shop in town, a wife, 2 kids and friends with pretty much everyone here. It was perfect. Until last week.

It was surprisingly cold night for the desert. My kids and wife were all upstairs asleep and I was busy watching tv downstairs. I was deciding whether to go to sleep now or go to sleep later and call out of work the next day. That’s when I heard it. A soft clacking of something outside. I couldn’t put my finger on what it was at first, but then I heard the horn. Honestly, it sounded more like a scream than a horn, but a horn nonetheless. I fell on the floor trying to scram to get my coat. I burst out the front door and saw a headlight coming up the track. Could have been a car, but it was too steady and high off the ground to be a car. It came into view. It was an old streamlined engine.

The old faded yellow and blue glistened off the front as it pulled into the station across from my house. It was pulling a set of coaches. They were all battered and rusted beyond recognition, somehow still moving. I looked around in bewilderment. Where did this thing come from, why is it here and why is no one else hearing this? This track had been disconnected from the main new track right? Of course it had. It was on the news. What if it hadn’t? The thoughts lingered in my mind for a long time. Maybe it was a mistake? But then I looked at the rust covering the thing and the weird nature it seemed to emit steam, not smoke. It was like something trying it’s best to be a diesel but mixing up features of it with a steam engine.

I looked around again. Still no one was out. It was like I was the only one who had heard it. I walked towards the abandoned station and climbed the stairs, still not believing what I was seeing. I stood on the platform and looked up at the massive thing. The doors on the carriages had seemed to open without me noticing. I looked inside. Empty. Rusted walls and battered chairs lined the sides as a big red fading carpet lined the middle. I should have stopped there. Should have left and got someone. But I was so eager to figure out what was happening. So foolish. I stepped inside. Big mistake. The doors closed. The carriage rocked forward, like the train was trying to leave as fast as it could. I banged on the carriage door but it was no use, I screamed, kicked, punched, but it seemed to just take it. I saw the town move further and further away.

All I saw now was red sand and black skies. It was quiet. So quiet. Too quiet. I walked, half ran, up the isle and to the door leading to the carriage infront. I opened it and walked through. Another carriage, exact same as the previous one, except more warped. I swear the walls were moving, and the colour of the chairs changed at least three times. The more I walked through the different carts, the more they warped. Walls stretched and bent. Chairs rose and shrunk. Doors leading outside eventually disappeared altogether. It felt like I walked for hours.

Hundreds of carriages. The outside disappeared eventually. Don’t know when. Just did. At this point I wasn’t even in a train anymore, it looked like a cylinder shape with fleshy walls and ceilings. Finally, however, I got to the front, or what was considered the front. There was no controls, just a window looking out the front. All I saw was void and rails. Until there was none. I felt myself falling, I don’t where I was. Was I in the train? Was I out of it? I fell and fell and fell until I slammed into sand? I wearily looked up. I was back in the desert. Red sand covered me head to toe but I was never happier.

There was nothing for kilometres and kilometres. I walked for what felt like 4 hours but was probably longer. I finally saw the town again. It was dusk now. People were out. Looking for me. As soon as I was seen I was taken to the Sherrif for answers. I told him everything. He looked at me sternly. Too many weird things had happened in this place for him not believe me. He told me I’ll have to stay in the holding cell for a few hours to make sure I didn’t bring anything back with me. After a day though, and multiple tests, I was let go.

I haven’t told anyone what happened yet. Anyone who asks, me and the Sherrif just say I got drunk and wandered off. My wife was mad at that story but glad I was okay. Life has mostly returned to normal now. For a few days after I had strange nightmares. Weird colours. Insane shapes and visuals. They’ve mostly worn off now though. Last night however, I heard it again. It went past the station this time. Didn’t stop. Looks different. Different model of locomotive. Different carriages. Still the same vibe though. I didn’t sleep that night.

I’m currently doing research to find whatever is happening. If anything else happens, I’ll update.
