The drive back home was quiet, Cindy replayed parts of the statement given by Tina, her fingers grazing across the screen of her phone before turning towards me. *"I feel for them. I think Tina's right, Elmwood covered this up, it could mean dozens—maybe hundreds—of other cases where people suffered because of their negligence."* Cindy's voice wavered, pausing before averting her gaze.

*"I think my mother knew—she knew, and had the evidence to back it up."*

My grip tightened on the steering wheel, and the rhythmic hum of the tires filled the silence. *"It's not just negligence. If this was intentional if they knew the risks and ignored them... it's criminal."* I paused for a moment, biting my tongue just for a moment. *"How sure are you... about your Mom? Because right now I don't think we can afford speculations."* I asked honestly, yet as I felt the atmosphere shift with tension, I couldn't look back at her as I focused on the road.

"Because she wouldn't be dead right now if she didn't," Cindy uttered.

"It's not a fucking coincidence she caught some terminal illness weeks after they confiscated her evidence. I saw her medical records in my dad's office, I compared the timeline..."

Her words hung heavy in the air, I glanced at Cindy from the corner of my eye, her fists clenched tightly in her lap as if holding onto whatever composure she had left.

*"You think they intentionally caused her death?"* I asked, my voice soft but insistent.

Cindy let out a hollow laugh, shaking her head. *"I don't know. I don't have concrete proof, but..."* Her voice faltered as she shifted her gaze to the passenger-side window. *"I can feel it. As crazy as it sounds, believe it or not, I know my Mom would still be here if..."* She uttered, leaning her head against the window, letting out a tired sigh before closing her eyes, I stayed quiet letting the air of silence permeate the car once more.

The drive felt longer on the way back, quieter as it no longer held the light atmosphere we once had on the way to North Carolina. Cindy was deep in her thoughts, Tina's voice emitted from her phone once more, replaying parts of her statement.

*"This happened twenty years ago."* Cindy broke the silence, sitting upright slightly, her words heavy with the realization. *"The statute of limitations for things like this—wrongful death cases—it's long gone for Tina's family. Hell, even for my mom..."* Her voice caught at the mention of her mother.

I stayed quiet, letting her continue.

*"They—Elmwood—made sure to wait just long enough. They fixed those damn gas lines quietly, knowing well there were families like the Gonzales and..."* She faltered again, pressing her lips together and inhaling sharply. *"Like mine. Families they completely screwed over. My mom wasn't just fighting them—she knew something bigger was at play. And then, suddenly, she's gone. Her so-called illness... no one will ever prove a damn thing now."*

Cindy chuckled trepidatiously, clenching the phone in her lap, knuckles baring white.

*"But how long ago did your mom pass?"* I asked carefully, keeping my tone neutral as I glanced at her from the corner of my eye.

*"Fifteen years ago."* Her voice was quieter this time, almost a whisper. *"She fought them for years after the fire—she wouldn't let it go. She had to hold them accountable, even if it wasn't for Tina's family anymore. And then, just like that, she got sick. Weeks after they confiscated her evidence. And it wasn't long before we buried her."*

I didn't know what to say. Everything about this was vile, calculated. They'd waited long enough for most people to move on, for laws to bury the past behind legal deadlines. They'd bet on time doing their work for them—and they were right.

*"What was her illness?"* I asked.

Cindy hesitated, her lips parting before speaking, her voice hollow. *"They said it was lung cancer. But she never smoked, not once in her life."* She laughed bitterly, shaking her head. *"That didn't stop them from blaming it on her, though. The doctors couldn't explain how it came on so aggressively, but they ruled it 'natural causes'."* She let out a frustrated exhale, her hand balling into a fist in her lap.

I felt my chest tighten as I processed her words. *"You think it was connected to the gas leak?"* I asked carefully, not wanting to jump to conclusions but unable to ignore the glaring possibility.

*"Connected?"* Cindy's gaze turned to me, her expression contorted to gather her thoughts.

She turned back to the window, staring out at the darkness as though it held answers. "I-I'm not so sure..." she continued, her voice quieter now. *"There's a chance she was looking into gas exposure. Leaks like the one in the Gonzales' apartment? Long-term exposure can do more than blow up a building. It can poison you, slowly, and you don't even realize it until it's too late."*

*"Poison you how?"* I asked.

*"Mental hallucinations? Physical deterioration? I'm not very familiar with the logistics of its effects but when we get back we can do more research."* Cindy said, pausing as my gaze was focused on the road, the night sky, and the dark surroundings of rural woodland, only illuminated by the street lamps planted at the sidelines.

*"You know what's so evil about all of this?"* Cindy's voice grumbled as she looked back at me. *"They're untouchable now. No case, no proof. There is nothing to force them to answer for what they did. Tina's family... my mom... it's just so unfair."*

*"Maybe not legally,"* I admitted, gripping the steering wheel harder. *"But even if we can't take them to court, we can still expose the truth. That's what you're after, right? For people to know what they did?"*

Cindy nodded, her lips pressed into a thin line. *"You think anyone will care?"* she asked.

*"They will. The good ones would, the truth should prevail in the end, right? Or else what good is there out in the world if it isn't? And if it's out there, someone will pay attention. At least we'll know we did everything we could."*

With a trembling breath, she leaned her head back on the seat. "I don't know if it's enough."  
  
"Maybe it's not," I conceded. "But it's something."  
  
With the weight of our purpose drawing us closer to something none of us could really understand in retrospect, the remainder of the trip went by in quiet. After guiding me toward her apartment complex, Cindy was ready to exit the car but stopped for a second before turning to face me.

"Will you be busy tomorrow?" She asked.

"I'll be shopping for Christmas presents, I have a flight to catch in the 24th." I said, nodding as I noticed the slight falter in her gaze.

"Wanna come with?"

She smiled at my question, nodding. "That would be nice, I need a break from... all this." She gestured at nothing, pausing before letting out a soft sigh.

*"I don't know if I can do this alone,"* Cindy mumbled, I could hear the trepidation in her voice, I could hear how tired and worn down she was from chasing this case, from looking for answers that felt lightyears ahead of us.

*"You're not, I'm here. I'll help you."* I simply said, my voice didn't sound like my own, as I heard the words with my own two ears.

*"I need you to promise me, Josh."* Her voice wavered, almost shaken up by the desperation evident in her tone.

*"I promise."*

She smiled thanking me as I drove off, telling me she'll be waiting in my lobby around noon, then we can just grab lunch together tomorrow.

I left Cindy behind as I made my way back to my building. It wasn't far from where she lived, which made sense—she could easily visit Mr. Jobert throughout the week. The road felt quieter, the muffled rhythm of the wheels jolting me awake as I navigated over road bumps, my mind growing heavier with each passing mile.

The day had drained me completely. Even as I reached my apartment, my eyes lingered a little too long at door '506' before I moved toward my own. The tiredness enveloping my body, as I start to feel the lightheadedness develop into a headache. I shuddered, brushing off my grievances as I remember what I had seen inside the apartment adjacent to mine.

I contemplated calling the police, realizing that there was a high chance a person—most likely a homeless man was living in this abandoned apartment. I turned back to Mr. Jobert's door, wondering if I should just stay at his place for the night, but the feeling of guilt crept up again, keeping Cindy's secret from him. If I were to stay in his place, I'd feel as if I was taking advantage of his kindness—I've wronged him quite enough already.

The hallway was quiet, almost too quiet, the kind of silence that made the hum of the ceiling light feel deafening. Though my surroundings remained quiet, my mind raced a million miles, with my thoughts whispering endlessly inside my head, until I hadn't realized soon enough, that my hand was wrapped around my doorknob, before letting myself inside my apartment.

Or so it felt like it.

I settled in, a sense of calm washing over me as the stillness of the apartment took hold. I was about to head to bed, ready to call it a day after a long one, but first, I dragged myself into the kitchen out of habit more than necessity. I filled a glass of water, the coolness of the glass against my palm grounding me in the quiet kitchen. The only sound that broke the silence was the steady glug of water as it poured from the dispenser, and into the glass.

The night was quiet and calm, I could hear the video I left playing from my computer back inside my room, as the sound reached up to the kitchen in incoherent rambles. Though the gnawing headache that had subsided, It was all routinely mundane, up until I saw the smudges on my counter once again.

As I set the glass down on the counter, my eyes wandered to the dirt patch I'd seen before. There they were again. I furrowed my brows, wondering if I was just too tired to care. But I couldn't ignore them now, not with how the dirty water I had once seen back in my living room vent, began to drip from the ceiling above the dirt.

It led my gaze upward, directly underneath the dislodged ceiling tile.

Climbing onto the counter, my hands gripped the edge as I reached the loose tile. The dirty grip slid under my fingertips as I carefully pulled it free. My phone's flashlight came on, and I pointed it into the space above the kitchen. Dust kicked up in the beam, and I could feel it—heavy and thick like the air had been untouched for years. All I saw was the metallic tangle of old ducts and an empty void.

Yet still, I couldn't help but feel the gnawing feeling that there was something else up there. A presence. Something I couldn't see in the dark, but could feel. My stomach lurched, I felt there was something—or someone—behind me.

My nerves screamed at me to look, but every instinct told me to stay still, to resist the urge to look back, as the wisp of air blew on the nape of my neck in a breathing pattern.

I turned around.

My eyes settled in the dark as I tried to process the damp surroundings, scanning from one side to the other. It was right there when my eyes found what didn't belong amongst the dusty pipes, growing mold, and cobwebs. It was a teddy bear, its lifeless eyes beady and black, staring back at me with a permanent grin on its lips.

And then the smell followed, face contorted smelling the scent of rotten mold emitting deeper within the dark corner behind the protruding support beam. My eyes watered as I covered half of my face, and I made my way closer by taking down more ceiling tiles to throw on the kitchen floor below, keeping my foot steadily placed on the counter while walking carefully.

No amount of mental fortitude or desensitization could've ever prepared me to see what was lurking on the corner.

What I expected to have been a space was forsakenly wrong, as my breath caught in my throat, the flashlight beamed on what had been an obscured secret for years, just right at the top of my head.

At first, I didn't understand what I was looking at—dark, disjointed shapes clumped together in the cramped, dusty void. But then as my eyes settled in, the small skeletonized hand reaching out in my direction made my vision a blur, brought by the molding smell and the realization that tore into my chest.

Laid before me was a corpse.

The sight of the decrepit bones bore into my eyes, mottled with stains that darkened by age, moisture, and decay. The smell was faint but distinct, a sour blend of old rot and mildew that clung to the back of my throat, it was clear the decomposition of the corpse had long been completed, the curved outlines were unmistakably human, but chest wrenchingly shrunken smaller in size.

As my light shone further to observe its form, the tattered dirty blue sweater clung onto the upper body of the corpse, my eyes able to make out the cartoonish design of a dog on the clothing. I felt my eyes water further staring at the corpse, its eye sockets, and cavernous voids staring back at me with emptiness forever emboldened in the sockets of where its eyes used to be. The unhinged skeletal jaw hung wide and eternally frozen, screaming in silence for help, only for its call to be answered decades later.

It was a boy—I thought as I scanned further, now seeing the other remnants of belongings, lost and abandoned through time. A foreign object caught my eyes, or what I thought it was at first, before my sight registered further in the dark, only to realize it was a small sneaker, the dirt-smudged white, with its pink accents left forgotten not far from the boy's corpse.

After my gaze parted from the shoe, then my focus landed on what looked to have been the back of a skull, a bit larger than the previous one. It was a bit harder to discern what it was at first, I hadn't realized then that the matted streaks at the back of its head were what was left of its hair. The sight made my stomach lurch further, as a gasp was pulled from my throat seeing an even smaller form wrapped around the larger corpse.

I felt bile rise in my throat as streaks of hot tears rolled down my cheeks. My mind raced to all the grim conclusions I could discern, given what was before me. *"T-This can't be. This can't be those kids."* A cowardly whimper escaped from my lips, my voice cracking trembling on the verge of a sob.

The soft rustling among the corpses startled me, freezing me in place. I jolted to move, as my phone's flashlight pointed around my oppressive surroundings. Half of my body was still wedged up there, the stale air and layers of dust suffocating me. The sound grew closer, sharper. Then, a sudden chirp broke through the silence.

Before I could react, a blur lunged from the skeletal eye socket of what I now realized was little Andrew's skull.

*"What the fuck!"*

I shouted, jerking back instinctively. My foot slipped off the edge of the counter, and I grappled frantically trying to find my balance, with my hand latching onto a flimsy ceiling tile. I heard a sickening crack before the entire structure caved in.

I crashed, falling back onto the floor in a cascade of debris, my head bouncing off the tile with a sickening thud. Dust filled the air in choking clouds, with bits of drywall and plaster raining down on me. Though that was the very least of my worries.

Two bodies, or what was left of them, collapsed against mine—skeletonized remains that clattered and shifted against my skin. Jenny's little skull tilted grotesquely to one side, her jaw half-locked in a permanent scream. Mila's skeletal arms sprawled across me, her ribcage poking sharply into my side. Andrew's tiny remains landed just feet away, staring blankly into nothingness.

A shrill, bloodcurdling scream tore from my throat, filling the apartment with raw, primal terror. The metallic cloying stench of corroding metal, and growing mold filled my senses, oppressive and rancid. But beneath the putrid scents, something new, sharper—an acrid, chemical reek that burned my nostrils.

Gasoline.

My breath hitched as my eyes widened at the realization, my already-pounding heart seemed to stop altogether, even just for a millisecond. The smell clung to the air, thick and unmistakable, mixing with old decay. My hands fumbled to push the brittle remains off my chest as panic set in.

Somewhere in the apartment, a loud zap of what sounded to be loose electric wiring, hitting a puddle of water. Clicks and zaps preceded further from where I lay reflected from the sheen in my eyes, my gaze found the thin streaks of lightning.

A moment of deafening silence followed, then—

The world ignited.

At that moment, I barely registered half of my apartment being engulfed in flames, everything came as a shock and a blur to me. My ears rang, a shrill endless note that muted the fervid chaos around me. I stumbled back, knowing there was no way I could've escaped through the front door at the time of the explosion.

I took cover behind my couch, the blistering heat felt unbearable, every breath I took felt like a never-ending smoke in my lungs, as the air smelled like burning ashes and molten plastic. The fire frolicked closer as I felt tears emit from my eyes, my already hazing vision, a complete blur.

*"Mom... Mommy."* I called out for her out of panicked instinct, my weakened form grew weaker, as pain rippled through my body, the burns on my raw flesh searing through my senses, the damage registering to me as soon as the adrenaline subsided.

I made the effort to peek above the couch, my damaged hand crawling up to hold onto the backrest, as I slowly peeked to see the state of my apartment. I felt a hopeless churn in my stomach seeing the front door completely blocked off—a death trap as the flames made my once familiar space truly look like an altered image from hell.

My eyes darted to the hallway leading into my bedroom, the fire hadn't reached it yet; I saw the darkness beyond the flickering light, a stark contrast to the orange inferno beginning to consume half of my apartment.

*"Run, damn it!"* I cried out to myself, begging my own body to keep me alive, to muster up the energy to get to safety.

I forced myself, stumbling over bits of debris and fallen tiles, with pulsing heat emitting from behind me, as if it was clawing at me, pulling me back into the unforgiving flame. Yet I persisted—struggled, but persisted.

For the time being, the struggle was worth it as I made it into my familiar room, and my first instinct was to pry the window open, it was harder to do considering I only had one hand to use. As I coughed feeling light smoke emit from the bottom of my enclosed doorway, my eyes darted around the familiar space, looking for something to smash it open.

*"The book..."*

I coughed making my way towards my desk as I grabbed the heavy book with one hand, the hard-covered shell looked strong enough to smash through the window, with its triangular metallic frames at the edges.

Without hesitation I chucked the book, breaking the window's glass into pieces, shattering outside, raining shards out onto the empty street. I cried out for help, screaming and crying for someone, anyone to come and save me—yet nothing.

Defeated I knew jumping off would just result in another method of death, though I contemplated. Taking the faster way out, or waiting as death slowly inched its way to my doorstep.

As I walked towards my desk, I thought about what I could only truly do at this moment, at this time;

. . .

Mom, I'm sorry for not always listening to you, and for being so distant throughout the years. I love and appreciate everything you and Dad have done for me, for me and my siblings. I don't say that enough, I don't tell you guys how much I love you all, no matter what negative feelings we may harbor and ignore silently.

We may not be bound by blood but you've given me a life so many other kids myself couldn't have back then, and for that, I will always be grateful.

Mr. Jobert, I can't begin to express the guilt I feel for keeping Cindy's secret from you. The man who's welcomed me with open arms and practically treated me like your own, when I was at my loneliest I had you. I still remember the many nights I'd knock on your door, and we'd share a drink as you talked to me about what life was like out at sea.

At some point I even thought you were just making stuff up because of how absurd they sounded but, they—you brought me comfort when I needed them the most, thank you for taking care of me, I wish I could do the same for you as you get older.

Cindy, I'm sorry I won't be able to make it to our first real hangout, I know we've only known each other for such a short time, yet I've truly found a friend in you, and for that, I can't thank you enough.

I think what I'm most sorry for, is that I made a promise to you, I made a promise to help you uncover the truth beneath the lies you've been fighting for so long.

I hope in some way I was able to be of help to you in bringing the family justice, you have a good heart, Cindy, don't let the darkness of this unfair world change that.

Truly, I wish I could be there, I wish I could help you see this through until the end, but unfortunately, this is as far as I can go. I pray that you make it, I pray that you find what you're looking for.

Because I think I have; I think I can hear them Cindy, they're calling me, telling me to come home. For now, I must go, but until we meet again. Goodbye for now.

Your friend,

*Jos*—
