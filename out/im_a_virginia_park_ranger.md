im sorry for my improper grammar and capitalization im typing this all on my phone. i don’t know where to post what i have found or seen, but i think this place here people will believe what i have to say. frankly, i don’t really believe myself. maybe what i saw was wrong. just the full moon reflecting against the trees in just the right way to give way to illusions to dance against my eyes. but i my gut tells me it wasn’t just some mistake, that whatever i saw was the real deal. 

growing up in appalachia, i always heard stories of things that go bump in the night. hearing many of the sounds to put a story too was the perfect fuel for a child’s growing imagination. but as i grow older these stories just grew to build up the better half of my cultural background, but most importantly, my love for the beautiful mountains and geology of virginia. all this to say it was my dream since a child to be a state park ranger. right as i turned 21 i joined the academy and was hired by the natural bridge state park. 

when i was hired, no one ever mentioned to me what i saw. of course i expected that as i always believed they were just  stories of folklore to the land. i haven’t even been here long, only about a week, there are some nights im on trail patrol. tonight i was on night patrol it was a full moon. when you look atop the natural bridge the light shines against the trees in a particulars bright way. maybe it’s just being at a higher point but im not really sure why this happens. but what i saw astonished me. but more than that it scared me to my core. and when i tell ya 12 years of catholic school and being a ccd teacher doesn’t prepare you for this, you best believe it.

i began to hear voices. at first i just thought they were some sounds in the woods, but they sounded off in an unnatural way. not something the forest would make. so i began to listen closer and this is what i thought i heard

that’s the best i could make out with the sounds they were saying. right around hearing that mess of words in the wind, i begin to see these bright eyes stare at me from across the natural bridge. these bright stark white eyes that were punching lead into my soul. and with them came these fluid black human like bodies. i swore when i saw them they flowed with the wind a little bit. they just kept staring at me with those words thrown into the wind to braise against my ears. then all of a sudden, what looked like mouths began to open real wide like. about three times the size of their eyes if i had to guess and the words got louder and louder. well i can tell you what i wasn’t staying around to find out what was happening next cause i was out of there as fast as i could. even took a small tumble my way out of that part of the park. i’m back at the station now. i gotta find out if anyone else knows about this.
