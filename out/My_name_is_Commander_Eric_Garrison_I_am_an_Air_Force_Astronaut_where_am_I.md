I do not know how I should start this. As the title says, I am an astronaut for the United States Air Force, and I don’t know what has happened, I also do not know how much I could share with the general public who I assume is reading this, well, it likely is declassified now so I think I could share. I am/was part of a program in the ’70s called Blue Gemini, it used the same technology used by the original NASA Gemini missions in the early ‘60s we used them for “peacekeeping” operations, specifically spying and messing with communications satellites, the latter is important. I was sent up on July 30th, 1973, onboard Blue Gemini 14 with me being the Commander of the mission, along with me is Robert Mackenzie, another Air Force astronaut. The mission was to intercept a Soviet spy satellite publicly called Kosmos 749 and secretly deorbit it. The flight was standard with the launch of our Titan II rocket from a classified launch site north of Indian Springs AFB in Nevada, we intercepted the satellite at T+2.6 Hours after launch, this is where I am not sure what happened, we were planning to deorbit it when all of sudden bright light, almost like a star, enveloped the satellite and our spacecraft, we tried to radio Vandenburg saying that something has happened however all we heard back was static, then a Russian voice spoke through the radio with an almost disappointed voice: "You will regret what you have wroth." Then it felt like my brain was being overloaded with information, nothing I can specifically recall but what I think was the history of the universe all being processed through my brain, then I believe I blacked out.

I woke up from what felt like a long slumber, still in the Gemini, sitting in my seat, with Robert blacked out, I glanced through the window to see that 749 was in tatters, pieces of metal and equipment strewn everywhere, it seemingly exploded, not longer after, I jolted Rob awake, he was as confused and tired as I was, we tried to radio Vandenburg again but once again, there was no response, then I noticed something near me, floating in the spacecraft, it was some kind of computer, but not like a normal massive one, it looked like a typewriter with some sort of interface on it, we plugged it into our battery supply to make sure it still had power. That computer is what I am currently typing on, we also noticed the date on the computer not long after, it has been half a century since we launched, yet we look the same, what has happened?

We are somewhat conflicted now, we don’t know what to do now, we might deorbit, and we will have to land in the continental U.S. because I doubt our recovery ship is still waiting at sea.  
I might post again for an update on what we will decide, we don’t have long though, we have two days worth of food and water.

I just don't get it, was this some punishment from God? Is this our Judgement Day? Our only hope is that the world is now better than when we left it, now fifty years ago, likely everyone we know is dead or is now in retirement homes, and we are still the same age, almost frozen in time. We almost wish now we never joined Blue Gemini, here is hoping that our story could be shared.
