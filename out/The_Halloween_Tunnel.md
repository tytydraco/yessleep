“Scaredy-cat,” teased Carmen.
 
“It’s the least frightening haunted house on the planet, and you’re still too chicken to go in,” hissed Michelle.
 
I glared at the pair of eighth graders. Ever since I arrived at James Garfield Middle School, they’d taken it upon themselves to bully me relentlessly.
 
It didn’t matter that our classes didn’t overlap, as I was two years their junior. They always found ways to harass me during school events and field trips, as well as after hours, during which they waited for me to be alone, or at least away from any adults. They generally stuck to insults and put-downs, but they weren’t beneath going further when they could get away with it. I’d come home with plenty of cuts, bruises, and pain in my scalp from where they’d pulled my thin black hair.
 
They’d sized me up as soon as I’d entered the school bus. I was new. I read the wrong books, usually weird stuff about magic and the occult. I lived in the wrong area – one that was a substantial step down from the neighborhood with its own country club earlier on the bus route. I was late to hit puberty, rendering me smaller and less developed than my peers. And, I was deeply claustrophobic, as they learned when they locked me for several minutes in a supply closet, prompting me to scream my heart out.
 
My dad kept telling me that if I just ignored them, they’d eventually leave me alone. But it was advice that I gradually realized was naïve. Sure, some bullies will lose interest if you don’t give them the reaction they want. But not these ones.
 
On this particular occasion, it was Halloween. Our school took the holiday relatively seriously, condensing the day’s class schedule and reserving the final two hours for festivities.
 
Due to rain, the event largely transpired in the school gymnasium. The room was filled with seasonal activities – apple-bobbing barrels, pumpkin carving stations, and even a dunk tank with a target that resembled a spider web and a giant jack-o’-lantern shaped base. The vice principal and an elderly teacher, both remarkably good sports, took turns sitting inside. They were dressed as a pair of witches who, according to local lore, wreaked havoc on our Pennsylvania community centuries ago. 
 
I wish I could have enjoyed the event as much as my peers. But the echoing noise and the prospect of being stuck in a room with a large crowd quickly sent me fleeing. Before long, I found myself in an adjacent corridor where a small number of students perused a few less popular attractions.
 
I walked to the end of the hallway, where I saw that the music room had been transformed into a makeshift haunted house. *Great*, I thought. There was virtually nothing I hated more than haunted houses. I didn’t mind the spooky decorations – in fact, I had a soft spot for them. What I hated was the idea of not knowing where I was, of not being able to see, and of being stuck in confined spaces where, at any moment, someone in a costume might jump out at me.
 
Seeing nothing else to do, I sat against the wall and waited for the event to be over. That’s when Carmen and Michelle came along.
 
~
 
They’d followed me there. At first, they pestered me for being alone. “What a surprise finding the class weirdo here all by herself,” snickered Carmen. 
 
“No, um, I just wanted to see what was over here,” I lied.
 
Michelle’s face formed a skeptical expression. “If that’s the case, then why are you sitting down?” She glanced at the music room entrance, then back to me. “You know what I think? I think you’re too afraid to go in there. Little miss *terrified-of-everything*.”
 
“No, that’s not it-”
 
“Michelle’s right!” chimed in Carmen. “You’re too scared!”
 
“You’re, like, the biggest wimp I’ve ever seen in my life,” jeered Carmen. “Just pathetic.”
 
“Leave me alone,” I whimpered.
 
“*Leave me alone*,” mocked Carmen, adopting a comically high-pitched voice to mimic my own. “We’re going to tell *everyone* that you’re too much of a coward to go into the world’s least-scary haunted house.”
  
They carried on like this for several minutes. As they did so, three students emerged from the haunted room. They looked, well, happy. As they headed back towards the main event in the gym, they talked and giggled excitedly amongst each other. Certainly, they didn’t seem the least bit bothered by what they’d encountered.
 
I let out an annoyed moan as I realized that the path of least resistance was just to give Carmen and Michelle one less thing to bully me about by walking through this stupid attraction. Even with all my phobias, how bad could it honestly be? “Look, I’ll do it, okay?”
 
“Whatever,” Michelle retorted. “Like we really give a shit what you do. Just know, though, that if you chicken out and try to leave, we’ll be here waiting, and we’ll see it.”
 
“Same goes if you come running out screaming, or having one of your pitiful little panic attacks,” hissed Carmen as she removed her phone from her pocket. “Everyone’ll have a video of it by morning.” 
 
“I’ll be fine,” I muttered. And with that, I pushed open the door marked *Entrance.*

Before me, a combination of boxes, music stands, and bookshelves formed a corridor adorned with plastic spiders positioned on fake webs. As haunted houses go, it was certainly mild and kid-friendly. I did my best to control my fear as I pressed onwards.
 
Ms. Jensen, the music teacher, had certainly put a lot of effort into the environment. Plastic ghosts dangled from the ceiling. Prop graves, complete with fake hands reaching out from in front of them, littered the ground. The overhead lights flickered dimly, and what visibility I had was impeded by the fog emanating from a mist machine. Some of the props moved or made noises (or both) when they sensed my approach.
 
The path continued to a “Halloween Tunnel” formed of canvas held up by arched PVC pipes. A giant clown face covered its entrance, such that entering it resembled crawling into its mouth. There was no way around it – at least, not without turning around, or shoving bulky furniture out of the way.
 
I shuddered. As if the poor visibility wasn’t enough, I now needed to enter a confined space, just as I’d feared.
 
*This will all be over soon*, I told myself. *If I turn back now, they’ll make fun of me forever.* I took a deep breath, dropped to the carpeted floor, and crawled inside.
 
I placed one hand before the other and steadily made my way forward. Some decorations – mostly skeletons and pumpkins, all placed above the tunnel – were visible through the translucent canvas. But as I made more progress, the light started to fade, to the point that I could only see a few inches in front of me.
 
I kept thinking that I was about to reach the exit. But, the exit never came, even as I was sure that I’d traversed the full length of the room. As my body started to tire, I struggled to imagine how a tunnel this long could even fit in the area where it had been located. Perhaps if it wrapped back onto itself in a snake-like form. But I hadn’t sensed any turns. As far as I could tell, I was moving continuously in the same direction.
 
This kept going for a long time. Eventually, I realized I was sweating profusely, and not just because of physical exhaustion. Panic swept over me. What if I got stuck here, as impossible as that was to rationalize? What if no one found me? I imagined the walls, which I could barely see, closing in upon me, and the oxygen in the stale air I was breathing slowly disappearing, leaving me to suffocate. My mind started to drift away, and I grew dizzy.
 
That’s when a thought belatedly occurred to me. I had my house keys in my pocket. It would take a little effort, but I could use them to cut a tear into the thin canvas and force my way out. If I was somehow wrong about all this – if I wasn’t stuck in an impossibly endless tunnel – I could deal with the consequences of damaging Ms. Jensen’s prop later.
 
It was at that moment that I first heard it: a shrill cackle that reverberated through the tunnel. As it repeated, my surroundings tremored, as if shivering in fear.
 
At first, I thought it was coming from behind me. I quickened my pace, only to hear it ahead of me, too. That’s when I realized that it was coming from both directions at once.
 
“*Lyd-i-a,*” echoed the eerily high-pitched voice ahead of me, which stretched my name into three syllables.
 
“*Lyd-i-a,*” echoed an identical voice behind me.
 
At first, I wondered if it could be Carmen and Michelle playing tricks on me. But that thought faded when, ahead of me, two bright red eyes pierced the darkness. I gasped as the glow they cast revealed a face half-covered with ancient skin. No skin at all covered the other half, exposing the figure’s chalky white bone underneath. 
 
I looked backwards, only to see two similar eyes from a similarly decayed face glaring at me from several yards behind.
 
“*Why so afraid?*” they asked, in unison.
 
I shook all over. I tried to croak out a response to them, but I couldn’t muster the words. Whatever these things were, I didn’t want to be anywhere near them.
 
Then something miraculous happened. Or, at least, it seemed that way to me at the time. The tunnel split off, with a new pathway opening to my right. Without a moment’s hesitation, I turned and crawled as fast as I could.
 
Obviously, none of this made any sense. But I was caught up in the moment as my survival instincts kicked in. In the distance, I spotted light. Could there be an exit ahead?
 
As I clambered forward, I imagined the hideous figures close behind me. I didn’t know who they were or what they wanted. I just knew that I couldn’t let them catch up to me.
 
Finally, an exit appeared. As I climbed to my feet amidst blinding light, I felt aches all over my back and legs.
 
As my eyes adjusted, I realized I was back in the corridor outside the music room. *Thank God*, I thought, feeling a sense of relief.
 
It was short lived. I shrieked as pain seared through my lower leg.
 
I turned to see a decrepit, veiny hand reaching out of the tunnel. It had long, sharp fingernails. Blood – my blood – dripped from one of them where it had cut me. For a brief moment, the two revolting faces peered up at me from the tunnel with looks of pure hatred and malice. *I wasn’t safe, and they were still following me.*
 
As I sprinted away, I screamed for help. Only, there was no one to hear me. As I passed by the cafeteria and into the gymnasium, I encountered no students or teachers. The whole building was eerily vacant.
 
The only new feature was the dust. Layers upon layers of it, several inches deep in many places, that caused me to cough and sneeze as my feet kicked it up.
 
Finally, I reached the main door to the outside. I pushed frantically at it, but it wouldn’t budge. I realized, to my frustration, that it was chained shut.
 
Another set of loud cackles rang out, their echoes resounding through the hallway. I grimaced as two figures appeared. Once again, they were on either side of me – both at a far end of the corridor – where I was stuck in between them.
 
Both figures were, or at least once were, women. But, now, both their clothes – a low-necked gown, on one, and a grey dress and petticoat on the other. Their bodies were tattered, revealing patches of bone and dry, sickly skin. They both had stringy, grey hair, and they both appeared to levitate a few inches off the ground.
 
I watched as the one to my left suddenly dived into the thick dust that covered the floor, disappearing from sight. I turned to my right to see that the other woman, too, was gone.
 
That’s when the floor close to me rumbled. My heart sank as both figures emerged less than a yard from me, each wielding a sharp dagger with a wooden hilt and a double-edged blade. Dust covered their forms, and they both emitted what sounded like a furious attack cry.
 
I ran once again.

Before long, I found myself crouched in a small nook in the back corner of the library. I was caked in sweat and dust, and it took several minutes for me to fully catch my breath.
 
As far as I could tell, I’d managed to shake my pursuers. But I doubted I’d elude them for long. The cut on my back leg, which I desperately needed to clean, was still dripping blood. 

Questions ran through my mind. Why was the school so empty? Perhaps I’d been lost, or stuck somehow in that tunnel, for longer than I’d realized, and everyone had gone home. But if that were true, then how did all this dust get here? Had I slipped into some sort of alternate reality? And who were the two people, or whatever they were, pursuing me, and what did they want?
 
A “thud” drew my attention as a book from the shelf that bordered my hiding spot fell and landed on the nearby floor, sending up a small cloud of dust. Its cover displayed in bright red letters: *The Story of Lydia*. It didn’t list an author.
 
I picked it up. The cover, binding, and typeface were all extremely old. The table of contents, meanwhile, consisted of a list of people – all of whom, at various points in my life, had mistreated me.
 
I flipped through the rest of the book. It described incident after incident when someone insulted or bullied me. The girl who’d ripped open my stuffed animal at summer camp. The girl who’d shoved me to the ground on the playground. The girl who told me that nobody liked me, and that even my father was just pretending. The teacher who’d falsely accused me of cheating. And, over and over again, the following words appeared after each description: *Lydia did not fight back.*
 
The last section recounted everything Carmen and Michelle had done to me, from routine snubs and put-downs to outright violence. Once again, the chapter closed with the words *Lydia did not fight back.*
 
By the time I reached the end, I was steaming with rage. Both at the many people who’d mistreated me, and also at myself for not standing up for myself and, in a way, sometimes enabling it to happen. Again and again, I’d let people walk all over me.
 
When I closed the book, I saw three numbers, 211, written on its back cover followed by a phrase handwritten in red ink, “*Only if you have what it takes.*”
 
~
 
I instantly knew what 211 meant. It was my locker number, located on the second floor. When I reached it, my usual combination worked.  
 
Inside, at the bottom of the locker, was a dagger identical to those I’d seen both members of the duo wielding earlier. Underneath it was a note in the same handwritten red ink as on the back of the book. It read, “*They want to kill you. Fight like your life depends on it.*”
 
~
 
I resolved to return to the tunnel. It struck me as my best ticket back to reality. Once in it, I’d crawl back to the juncture and, if no exit was apparent, I’d cut through the canvas.
 
As I walked, I half-expected an ambush by the two phantoms. But I didn’t care. I was done hiding. If they tried something like that, I’d try to fight them off. I’d defend myself, or die trying.
 
Of course, this raised the obvious question: who dropped the book next to me in the library (or created it, for that matter), and who led me to the dagger? Was someone here looking out for me and, if so, why?
 
As I neared the corridor containing the entrance to the music room and the exit from the tunnel that had brought me here, I noticed a figure in the distance. She was pacing and covered in dust. I dived for cover, successfully managing to avoid alerting her to my presence.
 
I dropped to a crouch and, once I could tell that she was facing the opposite direction, quietly crept towards her. The air in the corridor was thick, and the light was so dim that the figure was little more than a dusty silhouette. *She's one of them,* I told myself. *This is my chance to catch her by surprise. My life depends on pulling this off.*

As I narrowed the gap between her and me, a rage inside of me began to fume and boil over. I wasn’t seeing a person; I was only seeing the target of years of pent-up hatred. The figure was entirely masked in grey dust, and as I got closer, the smell of mildew and decay that clung to it blocked out all other thought. These two undead women were only the latest in a long line of people who’d never gotten their comeuppance for what they'd done to me. That was going to change, starting now. I raised the dagger and pounced.
 
~
 
The events that followed passed in a blur. I remember cries of shock and pain. Dust flying in the air, followed by spurts of blood. A body crashing against the floor. 
 
I remember dropping my dagger as I dove into the tunnel, crawling, *racing* toward a distant light. The sounds of cackling close behind me, then further away, then faintly fading. 
 
I remember emerging into the haunted music room at the end of the school day; bursting into the hallway outside, too frantic to notice, or care, who was there to see me; and running through a door and into a downpour outside. I didn’t care about the rain, or the thickets that scratched me as I rushed through them. By the time I got home, I was drenched and exhausted, and there were cuts on my clothes and skin.
 
~
 
I knew that telling the truth wouldn’t get me anywhere with my dad. So, by the time he got home from work, I’d showered and thrown my filthy clothes into the laundry, and I had an explanation for the cuts that involved slipping in the mud and falling into a thick shrub.
 
I avoided any Halloween festivities that night. Instead, I lay on my bed trying to make sense of what had happened. Eventually, I considered the possibility that it had all been an anxiety-induced hallucination. I recalled how I’d grown dizzy and nearly lost consciousness while in the tunnel. In that moment, had my mind just combined my worries about Michelle and Carmen with the local legend about witches that I’d been reminded of only a few minutes prior? Yes, I had a gash on the back of one leg, but couldn’t that be a scratch left from the thorny plants I’d gone through during my frenzied journey home? My mind slowly settled on this explanation as making more sense than any alternative.
 
That all changed when I got to school the next morning and learned that Michelle was missing. Worst of all, she’d seemingly disappeared while on school grounds the previous afternoon, which contributed to dozens of uniformed police officers prowling the building throughout the day.
 
Two of them spoke to me privately. Apparently, Michelle had gone into the haunted room after me. According to the officers, she was ‘concerned for my safety’ after realizing I’d been in there for quite some time. I knew that this was something Carmen had told them, and that Michelle’s motivations had more to do with finding an excuse to further humiliate me, but I kept that to myself. I answered their questions coldly and succinctly, offering nothing about the bizarre journey I’d gone on or the two apparitions who’d chased me in some parallel world. Eventually, they let me go.
 
“What did you do to Michelle, you freak?” Carmen screamed at me during lunch that day. To the shock of everyone else in the cafeteria, I gave her a bloody nose with an abrupt blow to the face.
 
~
 
I didn’t care about the detention that followed, my subsequent grounding for three weeks, or my father’s stern lectures and disappointed looks. What I *did* care about was that Carmen never messed with me again.
 
I’m no longer the same person I once was. That person ceased to exist when I realized that the dust-covered figure outside the tunnel was no ghastly witch. When I took out years of frustration and anger not on the entities I believed wanted to kill me, but, rather, on a school bully who merely wanted to pester and embarrass me. Who’d followed me through the tunnel for that very purpose. Who two witches had let pass into their realm to be sacrificed not by them, but by me. 

That person, my old self, died along with Michelle as I stabbed her again and again before leaving her body in a distant place where I knew that it would never be discovered.
 
I wasn’t even surprised when, several days later, another book appeared in my locker. After all, I’d caught on to why these spirits, these witches of the distant past, had taken such an interest in me, and I finally had a good idea of the purpose behind their actions. Namely, they had been testing me, and I’d passed with flying colors. I was eager to claim my reward and to finally become part of something greater than myself.
 
This book was filled with spells and incantations. I’d read spellbooks before, but this one was different. This, I knew instantly from the authentic feel of its ancient, grimy pages and the ominous aura I sensed in it, was the real deal. It detailed the steps necessary to carry out many forms of dangerous, dark magic. It was the kind of book people had good reasons to burn. And yet, this particular book had survived, and even made its way to me.
 
Familiar handwriting inside its front cover read, *Welcome to the coven. You’ll be hearing from us again, soon enough, dearest Lydia.*
