It is somewhere in the early 90s. I rent out plastic spaceships and cameraware seasonally to local news and watchable media creators looking to post about UFO experiences they have witnessed. For premium suckers I hire a group of carpet cleaners to break into their residence and line their hats with tin foil. 

My ancient-ish ancestors from Dutch South Africa did not only stop at elephants and zebra folk, they messed around with cameras since a large one was shipped over in eighteen-poopty-hundred-year, never to return. My people have mastered cameracraft and my shop and I consider ourselves to be at the very pinnacle, the absolute Forefront of humankind, with access into the souls of everynyan and their maaaahders. I swing my tripod of camera around my hometown with a robust confidence in hopes that I will inspire my DutchSouthAfrican brothers and DutchSouthAfrican sistars to follow in my greatness and forge their own path. 

I have since approached an affluent young individual of a local culture here in my shop in relatively cosmopolitan West Germany. His parents know their way around town and through expert camera work I have worked over his father's business to the point where I have access to not only every angle of visual feed in his bedroom, bathroom and commode, but can track his pulse through a chip para-legislatively stuck in his arm shortly after childbirth. 

We are a humble people and limit our records to tapes of sexy time and group pissing. Absolutely not was I prepared for what I then faced my eyes open to see from beyond the coopy corn kernels of the pathway facing his mag-household (household beyond feasible imagination of the poverty line we work to sustain here in DutchSouthAfrica)

I track the location to ten fathoms below the local pirate dock. My own personal hand scope allocates for an infrared locator which paints for me a picture of the seabed, this is used during famine season to shock fish and non-ethnic tourists for purposes of consumption. 

I spread and position myself and my equipment humbly and under tent by the harbour. I feel an intense breeze circle my chemise and nibble at my ankles. It is Raboul Yulematouli, a free fool by the people of the pool. I pay the truffle tax and bequeath my salted meats and various other DutchSouthAfrican tchotchkes and verbal aphorisms in hopes of satisfying his in-wired need for chaos and excitement. 

He goes on his way. I am outside of the tent, the wind now brushes my hairs. It is not a pleasant affair. I have assembled the hardware, and, now free from any malicious affairs with persons o'er'there, I sit on my foldable stool and start up the machine. 

The coastline erupts into life. As the electro magnetic pulse blasts shut the bulbs of the dock light, suddenly there is no fease for the commotion. I sense Jabouli Raggamatouli nearby (close brother of the other), and so know I am safe. I then unpack my horse and unsheathe my torch, the tech says he should be well within reach. 

A angry haired penguin bobs lifelessly on the shoreline. In his mouth, is a finger. Attached to the finger, is a whole arm. 

  
I will require multiple fundings for a part 2. Like unto Me and my Post and I shall confirm that you are out there, fear not of hackings for my own location in DutchSouthAfrica is no longer safe and the ethnic authorities seek my every move. 

I also thank Mr Huffman Senior for delivering unto me the sloppiest toppy currently known to man. Again, it is somewhere in the 90s, so his face wrinkles and other agings have not yet set in, and he is still quite firm.
