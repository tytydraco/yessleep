Found in the files of the late Mr. Wolfram Hart, a friend of mine.

I am writing this down because I cannot actually tell people about this bizarre force of nature. So I will leave this in my desk should they be of an open mind.

I was walking with a dear friend of mine, David O’Hairo, when he told me of a strange dream he had a few years ago. He was star gazing at Enchanted Rock, Texas, when a someone called his name. It did not sound like anyone whom he knew, so he turned to gaze upon the owner of the voice. Standing before him was a tall, muscular man, with a gnarly staff. He had a shirt made of animal skins, covered by bones of unknown creatures tied together as makeshift armor. David just stared at the guy in wondering amazement. But his awe turned to terror when he noticed the man’s face. A look of hatred and hunger shown on it and the guy said, “I have waited long for your arrival, and I am willing to wait some more. Your fate lies with me and always has been.”

Before David could do anything, the man was upon him, beating him senselessly with the staff. After several blows, the man drew a knife and dealt a killing blow to David’s heart. But David did not wake up from his dream. Instead he witnessed his own body go limp, and watched as the man knelt down and began removing organs and putting away in a bag. Finally, the man dismembered David, leaving only blood as evidence of what transpired. 

Only then did David wake up. He reasoned that this was just a bad dream and that it was his wild imagination, as he is an author himself, playing as he went to sleep the night before. A few days go by, when the police show up at his door to do a wellness check on him. They had found a lethal amount of blood, that matching his, at Enchanted Rock. After a long and extensive investigation, evidence showed that David had not been there in the past few days, and there were countless alibis on his behalf. David kept quiet about his dream, as he is a man of reason and science, and does not believe in the supernatural.

He explained all of this to me, and said that while he has no scientific evidence to explain what happened, he believes that there has to be a logical explanation. I did not know what to think. We both follow Ockham’s Razor which states plurality should not be posited without necessity. Effectively, it means whatever is is the simplest explanation to an event is probably the actual explanation. For example when a person hears a cry in the woods, the most likely scenario is that it was a animal or a another person, not a spirit. 

All of this took place a few years ago, so I eventually forgot about the bizarre story, and went back to my own devices. That is until a few weeks ago. David went to Enchanted Rock for an astronomy project and disappeared without a trace. Nothing was left behind save his gear at his campsite and his car. It was as if he just stopped exiting in the middle of the night. A search party ensued and David was never found. I found myself drawn especially to this thought provoking riddle. 

After a while of thinking, I finally opened my mind to the possibility of the supernatural. I started with some research into little known American Indian lore. Lore so old, most have forgotten, but some friends in some certain academic circles of mine pointed me in the correct direction. And now, I, Wolfram Hart, have gathered an answer to this puzzle together.

The creature that David dreamed of was real, and he died precisely the way he witnessed it. This being, I shall name “The Future Monster,” waits for an unknown amount of time until its prey exists. When it is ready it will attack the prey in the future through its dreams. The outcome of the dream becomes real and leaves behind what occurs in the dream, during the time of the dream. David’s blood was left behind many years ago because that is when he was killed by the creature. However, the creature cannot take the prey from the dream. It must wait until fate brings the prey to the location in the future. So when David inevitably went to Enchanted Rock, he was fulfilling his predetermined destiny. The attack happened years ago, but never took effect until recently.

I learned that the creature is bound to Enchanted Rock, so it can never leave. I ponder if someone can beat it in the dream, because the dream is reality. All I can say is if you, dear reader, have a bizarre dream, fight for your life. Because whatever happens in the dream is written in the fabrics of time. If you lose the fight, you will, by some force of nature, go to Enchanted Rock, and you will disappear, with no trace left behind. All the evidence of your body, (not material objects) would have already been their on the night of the dream. For now, I am writing like a mad man, so I will leave this in my desk, and continue my life knowing this truth. 




*this is a note from the op
Mr. Hart was a friend of mine who died in a traffic accident at the age of 26. I was helping his roommate with moving his things when I went through his desk and found this story and other odd writings of his.
