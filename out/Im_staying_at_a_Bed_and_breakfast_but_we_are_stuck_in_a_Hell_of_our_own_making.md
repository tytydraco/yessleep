I’m writing this more as a desperate shot in the dark than anything else. It’s been “22:30” for what feels like hours now, and I’ve exhausted every option. No phone service, no signal—not even a flicker. Oddly enough, the Wi-Fi here is flawless, but every time I try using social media to contact someone, my phone crashes. Just a black mirror staring back at me while I stand there, dumbfounded.

I peered through the peephole a few minutes ago. She’s still out there—same cold, dead eyes and that haunting grin. I suppose I should explain how we ended up here, rather than just unload this little pocket of dread and confusion.

We arrived at the Skirrid Rest Bed and Breakfast late in the afternoon. Despite it being summer, the sun had already dulled—casting a tired glow across the hills. It’s the kind of idealised Welsh setting you’d see on postcards: endless green, scattered sheep, and the occasional stone wall snaking off into the distance. Remote, quiet, almost empty—apart from the squat little B&B with its makeshift gravel car park. The red phone box and old cobblestone walls were a nice touch, admittedly.

I was leaning against my battered old Skoda—bald tyres, back window a web of cracks—next to Jim. Ciggy in one hand, can of Stella in the other. He looked like someone who’d long since given up on life, though he’d made the effort to throw on new Jordans and a double denim outfit that somehow worked.

He took a long drag of his cigarette before muttering through the smoke,
“Fuckin’ hell, where are the others? I’m gonna end up lookin’ like Old Jimmy standin’ here in this heat.”

Old Jimmy—no relation—was the local drunk. He’d passed away three weeks ago. Cremated now. A bit of a morbid comparison, but after an hour of air-con and silence, I appreciated the gallows humour.

Right as Jim was about to light another smoke, the rest of the crew rolled in. A massive silver Porsche with blacked-out windows crept over the gravel and parked beside my Skoda, instantly making mine look like scrap. Out stepped the rest of our group.

Clive was behind the wheel—self-made millionaire, sold medical equipment to pharmaceutical giants. His wife Jen was next, a lifelong friend we’d always suspected he’d marry. Then came Owen—no one really knows what he does now, post-uni. He just… exists. And finally, Petal—named by parents who clearly hated her—popped the boot to start unloading bags.

“Bloody hell lads, been waitin’ ages! Where’d you lot bugger off to? Bet Owen wanted snacks every ten minutes—the hefty bastard!” Jim bellowed cheerfully, walking over.

“Least I’m not pissed before 4pm most days, ya bloody alky!” Owen fired back without missing a beat.

They loved to rip into each other, but it was never cruel. Banter built on years of closeness. The rest of us exchanged hugs, jokes, and moved toward the entrance. Clive led the way—he’d made the booking and was playing group leader.

I knew why we were really here, though. The others chatted away while I sat quietly in the bar next to the lobby, flipping through brochures on local abseiling tours and cider museums. But my mind was somewhere else.

There used to be seven of us.

Hugh was the seventh. He and his wife, Gloria, had moved up here a couple of years ago. Over time, the group drifted away from him. Ignored his texts, skipped dinner invites, forgot birthdays and anniversaries. I tried—really tried—to keep the connection alive. Hugh and Gloria appreciated that. They told me, often, how much it meant that I still cared.

Last year, Hugh booked this very place for a “gang catch-up.” Everyone bailed. One by one. I was the only one who made the effort, but even I arrived late—my car broke down halfway. When I finally made it, flashing blue lights surrounded the B&B. Police. Ambulance. Fire. I walked into the lobby, shaken but not yet alarmed. The woman behind the desk told me, in a quiet voice, that a man and woman had fallen from the cliffs behind the building—a freak rockslide had knocked them into the garden.

It was Hugh and Gloria.

Grief hit like a freight train. I hated myself for being late. I hated the others for not bothering at all.

After the funeral, Clive and I talked. A lot. We agreed—maybe foolishly—that it would be right to come back here, just for one night, to honour him.

As I sat lost in memory, I felt a firm hand on my shoulder.

“Oi, lad,” Clive said, half-grinning. “Jen and I are sorted. The fitty behind the desk wants to give the rest of us a little intro. Says you’re up first.”

He pointed toward the reception. An old oak beam blocked my view of whoever was behind the counter.

I stood, walked around the beam, and stopped short.

The “fitty” Clive mentioned was a tiny old woman, barely five feet tall. Swaddled in blankets, her face wrinkled like a withered Granny Smith apple.
Oh, hello sweetie! You’re the single room, I believe?”

The woman behind the reception counter jangled a set of keys before extending a trembling hand holding a brass key marked Room 4.

“There you go—Room 4, the Sunshine Room! Oh, it’s lovely in there this time of year.”

I smiled, warm and polite, as she continued.

“Now, before you go, just a bit of housekeeping.”

I nodded, listening.

“The bar and restaurant close at 8, but if you need any beverages afterward, you can call reception. The third floor is strictly off-limits—we’re renovating the brickwork and it’s simply not safe.”

She then leaned in closer, her pale blue eyes locking onto mine with a sudden intensity.

“And lastly…” she whispered, voice lowering, “please do not leave your room between 10:22 PM and 10:40 PM. Under any circumstances. I beg you.”

I blinked, startled.

“We have… a wandering guest. A little confused. Likes to walk the halls around that time. You should be safe, of course, but—best not to upset them.”

Then, as quickly as the moment had gone eerie, she beamed again. “Anyway! Enjoy your stay, dear!”

Odd. A very specific time frame. But my logical side took over. I’ve worked with dementia patients who roam the halls at night and can get distressed if startled. This must be similar.

I gestured to Petal that her keys were being sorted next and told the others I’d take my bag upstairs and get ready for dinner.



My room—Room 4—was directly at the top of the stairs. A little gold number sat above a glass peephole, both centered neatly on the worn wooden door. I slid the key into the lock and jiggled it—then the door flew open with a sickening crack, slamming into the wall behind.

Heart pounding, I stepped back, half expecting someone to come charging out. But… nothing. I edged inside cautiously, until I spotted the open window. The draft must’ve done it.

I exhaled and dropped my bag on the bed, followed shortly by myself. The room was old, floral, and drenched in a very “grandma’s guest room” aesthetic—wallpaper, curtains, even the bedspread had floral patterns. Not exactly luxury, but charming in its own dated way.

There was a second bed in the room, across from mine. I stared at it for a while. If Hugh were here, he’d be sitting on that bed—laughing, talking. Instead, it sat still, the floral duvet tucked and undisturbed.

A soft knock at the door broke the silence.

Petal stood on the other side. She looked flustered but composed.

“Um, hi. I’m so sorry to intrude, but there’s been a bit of a mix-up. My ceiling’s leaking—probably from the renovations upstairs. Looks like I’m sharing with you tonight. You’ve got the only other room with a spare bed… if that’s okay?”

Without hesitation—perhaps too eagerly—I stepped aside to let her in.

We hadn’t known her long. Maybe six months, tops. She’d joined the group through Owen, originally his housemate. When he bought the place outright, he evicted the remaining tenants after Petal moved out. She now lived a few doors down from me, and over time, we’d grown closer through late-night games, takeaways, and drinks at Owen’s.

Petal was incredibly caring, almost to a fault. Timid at times, but brilliant. Long brown hair, a button nose beneath thin-rimmed glasses, and a smile that felt like being let in on a secret.

While she unpacked, I seized the chance to satisfy a lingering curiosity.

“Sooo, Petal… I’ve got to ask. It’s driving us all mad. What exactly does Owen do? He’s always cagey but never seems short on cash.”

She chuckled gently, “Oh, Owen? Well… I probably shouldn’t say, but… he dabbles in some shady stuff.”

“Shady how?” I asked.

“Have you been in his room?”

“No?”

“It’s full of weird shit. I can’t tell if he’s selling pot or summoning the dead. Crystal balls, skulls, bags of… product. People coming and going all the time. Half of them in bloody robes. I swear, the lad thinks he’s a wizard or something. That’s why I moved out.”

I wasn’t surprised. Owen had always leaned toward the occult. He’d offered to read my palm once, squinted at it seriously, then gasped and said, “Says you’re a massive twat.” Classic Owen.

But sometimes his antics leaned less funny and more unsettling.

Just a few weeks ago, we were driving back from up north. Owen was in the back seat when he suddenly leaned forward, grabbed my shoulder—nearly made me crash—and said in a weirdly calm voice:

“Don’t take the motorway. Turn off here. Go through the villages instead.”

It added over an hour to our trip. But Owen was insistent. I gave in.

Later that evening, scrolling through Facebook, I saw news of a major crash on the motorway. The same stretch we would’ve been on—just three miles past where we turned off.

I felt sick. Could’ve been us.

So, Petal’s revelation wasn’t that shocking. He may have been high half the time, but his instincts—however strange—were unnervingly accurate.



For the next hour, Petal and I lay on our beds and just… talked. It might sound dull, but it was far from it. She opened up about her life before joining our chaotic little group—family, childhood, heartaches, joys. We shared stories of grief and laughter, moments that mattered. Her voice was soft, soothing—like a warm mug of soup on a cold winter night.

We had more in common than I realised. Same values. Same emotional compass. She felt like a reflection of me, in a way.

Eventually, I glanced at the clock and realised we had ten minutes until dinner.

I excused myself to the bathroom with my crumpled suit in hand to give her some privacy. When I came back out, she was standing by the mirror, fiddling with the clasp on her necklace.

She wore a blue dress—elegant, flowing like waves on the Mediterranean. I stepped forward.

“Here, I’ll help,” I said, gently taking the necklace and fastening it.

Our eyes met in the mirror. A small, involuntary smile crept across my face—sincere and slightly nervous. I saw the same smile reflected in hers.

Then—BANG.

The door burst open and Jim collapsed into the room in a drunken heap.

“Helloooo, chaps!” he slurred. “Sorry to intru—intrude, but I’m off to the bar, then dinner. Thought a few pre-scran shots were in orrda.”

He flapped his arms, urging us to follow. Then, true to form, he didn’t walk down the stairs. He slid down the banister, landing in a graceless heap at the bottom.

Petal rushed down after him to check he hadn’t broken anything important.

I lingered on the staircase.

The wall beside me was lined with old paintings and photographs. Most were of the cliffs behind the building—oddly blurry, all at strange angles. They felt… off. Not artistic. More like something caught by accident.

At the center was a large oil painting.

The cliff post-mudslide. Rubble, debris, gray skies. But at the top of the cliff stood two indistinct figures. Shadows. Too blurred to identify—but they didn’t look painted. More like ink smudges. Fingerprints.

I stared at it, transfixed, until Clive’s voice broke the spell from below.

“Oi! You coming, or what?”

He tapped his watch impatiently. I turned, stepping down into whatever the rest of the evening had in store.
We all sat down at the table—a wide, round thing that looked like it had been stolen from the set of King Arthur. The restaurant section of the B&B was mostly empty, aside from a few older couples enjoying quiet dinners and a lone patron nursing what could only be described as a depressive pint.

I felt out of place in my suit, and judging by Petal’s glances, I think she felt the same in her dress. Meanwhile, Clive, Jen, and Owen sat glued to their phones. Jim was already leaning over the bar, helping himself to another pint of cider.

That left just me and Petal making small talk and placing our food orders.

An older man with a limp shuffled over to our table, notebook in hand. He wore faded jeans and a woolly jumper that had seen better decades.

“Evenin’, ladies and gents. Welcome to the Skirrid Rest’s evening meal offering,” he said with a crooked grin. “Can I take your orders? I’d recommend the starter—it’s on a deal and saves a few quid.”

He scanned our table, his eyes skipping over the pale, screen-lit faces until they reached me. He paused, steadied his grip on the notepad, and gave me a nod.

“Hi, yeah—I’ll have the soup to start. Then maybe the fish and chips for the main,” I said, closing my menu.

As I handed it over, he leaned in close and whispered something that made my blood run cold.

“Good choice. The soup was Hugh’s favourite… but you would know that. Not like the others.”

I froze, mouth slightly open. By the time I looked up again, he was already taking Petal’s order. The rest of the table replied with sighs and mutters of indecision until Clive finally scoffed, “Hi, yeah—was just wondering if there’s any actual food here? I expected something bad, but this microwaved pub grub is taking the piss.”

“I’m terribly sorry, sir,” the waiter replied through clenched teeth. “I’ll speak to the chef and see if we can prepare something… more palatable.”

He hobbled off, the severity of his limp making him sway dangerously with each step. The moment he left, the group returned to their phones, punctuating the silence with the occasional pathetic chuckle.

Petal and I resumed our quiet conversation until, surprisingly quickly, the waiter returned—far too fast for the kitchen to have conjured up whatever gourmet nonsense Clive expected.

“Bon appétit,” the old man said with a thin smile. “The chef’s special of the day. Locally sourced. Fresh from the valleys.”

He placed a steaming plate in front of Clive. And to be fair… it looked stunning.

It resembled a lasagne, but the colours were darker—richer. The meat oozed out the sides like molten lava. Two slices of garlic bread leaned gently against the pile, and a fresh bread basket arrived for the rest of us. The rest of our meals followed, and for a moment, there was peace. The rhythmic clatter of cutlery. Contented murmurs.

Then I saw it.

Clive, mid-boast about his business hitting a million-pound turnover, was about to shovel a dripping forkful into his mouth when I noticed something buried in the mess of meat.

A pale stub.

Short. White. Rounded at the end.

A thumb.

I stared, frozen, as he continued bragging, completely oblivious. I wanted to scream. But I didn’t. I didn’t say a thing.

He chewed, paused, winced.

“You alright, Clivey?” Jen asked, half-concerned.

Clive smacked his lips, sucked at his teeth, and replied, “Yeah, just a bit of gristle. Burst open, caught me off guard.”

He chuckled and kept eating.

I wanted to be horrified. And I was—but not just by the food. It was the fact that he, of all people, had eaten it. Karma. Somehow perfect.

He licked his fingers clean, wiped his plate with garlic bread, and sat back smug and satisfied. I had to excuse myself.



The bathroom was dim and smelled of mildew. I gripped the sink, hunched over, dry-heaving. My knees buckled beneath me. I splashed cold water on my face and reached for the crusty paper towels stained with who-knows-what.

As I looked up into the mirror, I froze.

Over my left shoulder, there was a figure.

Wearing a tattered orange puffer jacket, stained with maroon smears. A threadbare woollen hat clung to the head beneath—barely hiding a gaping wound where scalp met skull. And he was whistling.

Fly Me to the Moon.

Hugh’s favourite song.

Note for note, perfect—until the tune gurgled and cracked as though sung through broken glass.

I was paralyzed. Shaking.

The figure began to turn. Bones snapped. Skin peeled like old wallpaper. And beneath it—Hugh’s face, mangled and weeping.

I squeezed my eyes shut and screamed, “NO! This isn’t real! Piss off!”

When I opened them again, I was alone. The reflection had returned to normal.

I collapsed to the floor, trembling, huddled between the pipes beneath the basin. Time stopped.

Eventually, I pulled myself together. I reminded myself—rationally—that the doctor had recently upped my pain meds after the kayaking injury. He did say I might experience visual disturbances. Hallucinations.

Still, I hadn’t expected Hugh.



When I returned to the restaurant, the mood had shifted.

Jim had come back from the bar with three bottles of merlot and was drunkenly rambling to Petal—something about learning the history of the inn from “the dog behind the bar.” She looked… politely trapped.

“Where’ve the others gone?” I asked, muttering as I sat beside her. “Gone home already? Wouldn’t be surprising.”

“Ahh, you return!” Jim said with a theatrical wave. “No, no, Owen had one of his visions. Said he saw a woman in a Halloween costume running around outside. Purple woolly hat, apparently. Everyone went off chasing shadows. We intellectuals stayed behind for proper conversation.”

I didn’t answer. I knew who he’d seen.

I poured myself a large glass of wine and took a long drink. Petal declined a sip when I offered. A little while later, the others returned, moaning about being dragged into a wild goose chase. Owen stayed firm.

“No, lads, she was there. That purple hat’s hard to miss.”

They ignored him and settled in with the wine.



It was approaching 22:10.

I remembered the old woman’s warning and suggested we head back to my room—the biggest—for some cards and a few shots.

As we made our way upstairs, I glanced at the oil painting on the wall. Something was different.

Where there had been two shadowy figures earlier, now there was only one. And around its midsection, a streak of vivid orange paint had appeared—like a crude smear across the chest.

I didn’t have time to dwell. Jim pushed past, chanting, “Shots, shots, shots!”



Back in the room, Petal lined up the Tequila Rose. Owen shuffled the cards.

I checked the time.

22:30

Only eighteen minutes to go. I just hoped we could avoid upsetting any spirits—or the staff.

We’d barely dealt the first hand when Jim stood up and muttered, “Ahh, forgot me pint.”

He staggered toward the door.

I shot to my feet and blocked his path.

“Jim, wait. We’ve got shots. And remember what the lady said—no one leaves the room during this time. She was serious.”

Jim scoffed. “No, you listen. I don’t care what that old bitch said. Don’t care about some nutter walking the halls. I’ll take ‘em both on if I have to. Now get out of my way—or I’ll move you.”

He shoved me hard. I hit the floor.

The others laughed.

All except Petal, who rushed to my side, kneeling beside me.

“Pussy,” Jim muttered, swinging the door open as he staggered out.

Strangely, what hit me first wasn’t the pain from being shoved, or even the embarrassment. It was the crushing anxiety that we’d let down the old woman who had been so kind to us. I hate upsetting anyone—it twists my stomach into knots. But that guilt was quickly replaced by something much colder.

The lights flickered.

Then darkness.

The room was bathed in a pale blue glow from the moonlight leaking through the windows—casting everything in a ghostly, underwater hue. The silence that followed felt… wrong. Not just quiet. Wrong.

Clive was the first to speak, with an exasperated, “Fuckin’ hell.” He stood and tried the door. No luck. He shook it, then slammed his shoulder against it.

“It’s a key,” I said. “It’s not electric—just a lock.”

But it wouldn’t budge. Something was keeping us in.

Then came the whistle.

A slow, deliberate, off-key tune: Fly Me to the Moon.

It came from behind the door. Feminine. Familiar. And chilling.

The room dropped in temperature so suddenly that we all gasped. It was summer, yet we could see our breath.

Jen stood abruptly, her chest heaving.

“I— I can’t— I’m claustrophobic— I can’t breathe!” She bolted to the window and fought with the latch, but it refused to open. Her strength gave out, and she sank to her knees. We rushed to her side… and saw what lay beyond the glass.

Where there were once vibrant green valleys, there was now a wall of dark, dense fog. Nothing beyond the car park was visible. The world outside had turned monochrome—dead.

Then something moved in the mist.

A figure.

The orange puffer jacket. The limp. The gaping wound under the hat. The slack jaw barely held together by strained muscle and bruised skin. The skull was cracked and visible beneath the shredded face. A grotesque shadow of the man I once called friend.

Owen spoke first, his voice barely a whisper.

“Hugh? No… no, it can’t be. This is some sick joke.”

Then all of our phones vibrated simultaneously.

A message from Hugh.

“thank you”

I turned to Petal—she’d received it too. Still stunned, I tried to speak.

“Maybe… maybe he knows. That we came back for him. That we’re trying to—”

The look they gave me stopped me cold.

Clive’s hands trembled so violently he nearly dropped his phone. I reached out, steadied him, and looked at his screen.

Another message.

“Too little, too late. You did this. And she is pissed.”

Jen screamed and sprinted to the door. This time, it opened.

“Jen, wait!” Clive shouted, running after her. In seconds, both were gone.

I turned back to my phone.

Still 22:30.

Unchanged since Jim left.

The room was silent, save for Petal’s sobs and Owen muttering incoherently on the bed, rocking in the corner. I realized, in that moment, that we weren’t just haunted.

We were damned.

I stood. “You two stay here. I’m going out there. I need to make sure they’re okay.”

Petal leapt up. “No! I won’t let you. I… I can’t lose you.”

I took her hands. “Petal, I promise. I’ll get us out of here. I’ll keep you safe.”

She hesitated, then kissed my cheek and stepped back. I opened the door and stepped into the corridor.

It was colder still.

Stained glass windows cast fractured beams of red and blue moonlight down the hall. My breath fogged in front of me as I walked.

Fly Me to the Moon echoed faintly in the distance.

I made my way toward the stairs, thinking rationally: if Jim went to the bar and Clive chased Jen to the lobby, that’s where I needed to start.

But the stairs didn’t end.

I descended step after step, turning back on myself halfway down each flight, expecting the lobby below. But it never came. After what felt like 80 steps, my knees screamed in pain.

I sat. Panting. Dizzy. Alone.

This isn’t real. This is the medication. The side effects.

But fear crept in. Tears blurred my vision as I wrestled with helplessness.

Eventually, I turned to look back up.

Four steps behind me—just four—was the landing I’d started on.

Confused, I stood. As I did, I noticed a faint glow to the side. A new staircase—one that should’ve been sealed off for renovations—beckoned upward.

A creamy, golden light spilled down from the floor above.

Drawn to it, I climbed.

At the top was a door. Nailed shut with a picture frame hanging crookedly from the center nail.

A photo.

I stared at it and nearly collapsed.

Hugh sat on a worn sofa. Gloria beside him. Behind them—Gloria’s parents. The old woman from the desk. The man from the restaurant.

But next to them, awkwardly apart, stood Owen.

He didn’t belong there. Yet he was in the photo.

The door creaked open behind me. I turned—too late.

A force yanked me inside. Darkness swallowed me whole.

I wasn’t falling down. I was falling through.

Weightless. Endless. Floating in black.

It was… peaceful, oddly enough. A quiet space where I could feel everything—the months of guilt, the loss, the buried anger.

Then—impact.

But no pain. No blood.

I landed on cold stone, yet it felt like a mattress. I opened my eyes.

The reception.

And there—peeking over the desk—was the little old woman.

“Hello, sweetie. That was quite the fall.”

I stood, trembling. “You… you’re her mum, aren’t you?”

She smiled. “Yes.”

She guided me to one of the armchairs in the lobby.

“I only told you and Petal the rules because I knew you meant no harm. You weren’t the problem. But I’m so sorry you got mixed up in all this “ 
I couldn’t speak. Couldn’t form thoughts.

She sipped her tea. Calm. Composed.

“You have a kind soul,” she continued. “He’s forgiven you. But she… her hatred is too strong. I’ll do what I can to protect you—but I can’t promise anything.”

“Why?” I asked. “Why is this happening? Wasn’t it just… an accident?”

She shook her head slowly.

“No, dear. Not an accident. Hugh… he intended to jump. But not with Gloria. She followed him after she saw the note and as fate would have it the rockslide happened” 

I couldn’t hold back the tears.

“He always seemed so happy…”

She placed a hand on mine. “He was lonely. Redundant at work. Fading health. And no one—except you and Petal—answered his calls.”

A pause.

“He thought you’d all forgotten him. When you didn’t show up, he felt like he had nothing left. But he knows it wasn’t your fault you were late”

I broke down. She held me as I sobbed.

“But… why Owen? I saw him in the photo. Is she after him too?”

Her grip on me tightened.

“Yes. Owen… is Gloria’s stepbrother. My stepson. He was here that night—visiting his father. He tried to save them at the hospital. But what he brought back… wasn’t them.”

She stood and looked toward the desk, where her husband stood, eyes lowered.

“They’re trapped. And now… so are you.”

I opened my mouth to respond, but she raised her hand.

“Time to wake up, sweetie.”



I gasped.

Cold water. Tiles. The bath.

I scrambled out and flung open the bathroom door.

Petal ran to me, arms outstretched, sobbing. “Thank god! You were gone for hours!”

I held her tight—but my eyes were fixed on Owen.

He sat in the corner, rocking, eyes rolled back. His lips moved rapidly, chanting in a language I couldn’t understand.

Then came the whistle.

Low. Layered. Off-key.

Fly Me to the Moon. Sung by many voices.

I turned toward the door.

Slow creaking.

I approached and looked through the peephole.

And immediately vomited.

Three heads. Clive. Jen. Jim. Their eyes rolled back. Their hair held by a hand as pale as snow and stripped of flesh.Behind them, Gloria. Broken. Grinning.
She mouthed one word:
“Owen.”

I turned to him, still rocking.

And Gloria whispered, calm and cruel:

“I’ll wait.”
Which brings us to now.

Petal is in the bathroom, writing in her journal. I’m typing this out—frantically—hoping that someone will find it if we don’t make it.

The door is clicking open.

The creak is getting louder.

I’m sorry, Hugh.
