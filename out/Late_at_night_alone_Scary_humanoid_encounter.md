It was late 2009 when this story took place. I lived in a very small town in mid-Michigan called Springport. It is a farm town surrounded by woods and cornfields. The main road is only about a mile long, and that’s where I lived, in a trailer park sandwiched between a cornfield and a wooded area. My trailer was in the corner right next to the woods. My back door led right to the woods' edge, and I think that's important to remember for later in the story.

I lived with my mom (33), my dad (35), my oldest brother (17), and my second oldest brother (15). I'm the youngest and a girl (9). I think this is important because I believe it's the reason this thing came for me. Both my brothers were in wrestling at the time, and one thing about the school there is how seriously they take their sports. So after school, they would have practice, and usually, practice didn't get over until late at night, around 7-7:30 pm.

My father worked as a car salesman in a town 45 minutes away. He never knew when he would be out of work, and we only had one vehicle at the time, so my mom would leave quite early to meet my dad at work, leaving me, the 9-year-old, home alone from 3-7 every day. I was completely fine with it, as I was very mature and capable of being left alone at such a young age, and it was nice to have alone time without my annoying older brothers.

Because this was so regular, I kind of created my own routine when I'd get home. I’d have a snack, let the dog out, and then sit down with my pillow and blanket and watch my favorite show Ed, Edd n Eddy until everyone got home. It got to the point I would just stay camped out on the couch for the rest of the night. I would say I slept on the couch for 3 weeks straight.

So the way my trailer was set up, you could see the whole kitchen from the couch at a kind of diagonal. At the back of the kitchen, there was a hallway that led to the back door. You couldn't see the door from the living room, just the hallway entrance. And in front of the entrance, there was our dining table that looked like a booth.

One night, after everyone went to bed, I had stayed up watching a movie. I had been staying in the living room for a while at this point, so I was pretty comfortable being alone. I wasn't really an imaginative child, either. I never had imaginary friends, and even when I pretended the floor was lava, I never actually saw lava. So I'd confidently say my mind didn't make this up. I also wasn't watching scary movies at this time, so I wasn't imagining that either.

I was laying down with my cat watching this movie when all of a sudden I noticed him looking toward the kitchen with his hair up and he started growling. I looked over to see what it was and noticed something white crawling under the dining table. I remember being confused about what I was looking at because it didn't look right.

Next thing I knew, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something peeking around the corner of the table. When my eyes finally focused within half a second, this thing was like 10 feet long, all white and humanoid-shaped. It had no face, was smooth and super thin. I started getting super scared, and it started reaching for me. Its arm kept growing and growing, reaching to the living room, its fingers were like a foot long and as thin as pencils.

I lost all thought in my brain, and I stood up and tried to scream, but nothing came out. I was stuck in my blanket and felt paralyzed. I don't know how I did it, but I managed to get out of my blanket and run to my brothers' bedroom, which was right next to the couch, I made it to the door without looking back, and my cat ran in right after me as I slammed it shut. I slept on their floor that night and every night after that for a year.

I never brought it up and kept it in the back of my mind until years later when I got on the internet and read about creatures called rakes and skin walkers. Only then did I realize I wasn't crazy and that thing was real. To this day, I don't know why it chose me or what its intentions were, but I believe it sensed my energy from being home alone so much as a young child, and the reason I couldn't scream was that it was feeding off of me.
