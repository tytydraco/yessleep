My name is Levi Reyes. 

I don’t exist – not officially. You won’t find a birth certificate with my name on it, no government ID or even records of employment. 

I'm a ghost, twenty-six years old with only a single job on my resume, a job I’ll continue to work at until the day I die. Why? That’s just the kinda contract you sign around here. 

You won’t know my employer. Nobody does. It’s a paramilitary outfit more clandestine than the CIA, one that monitors supernatural threats, neutralizing them before the public catches wind of their existence. The Order of Alice, it’s called. 

Our mandate is simple: we hunt monsters. We track them, cage them, then break their minds into errant pieces before putting them back together again, molding them into Conscripts to fight on our behalf.  

See, there's a war coming – and no, I’m not talking about the third in the world's worst trilogy. I’m talking about a bigger war. Much bigger. 

Arthur C Clarke once said that two possibilities exist: either we’re alone in the Universe or we’re not, with both being equally terrifying. 

Well, Arthur was wrong. One possibility is infinitely more terrifying, and I can tell you that with certainty because we’re living it. 

We aren’t alone in this universe. Not by a long shot. There’s something else out there – something ancient and hungry. It lurks upon the black canvas of the cosmos, watching us from those empty spaces between slow-guttering stars. It doesn’t have a name. It doesn’t need one. All it wants is to feed, and it seems our world is next up on its menu list. 

If it takes a monster to stop a monster, then to stop an eldritch god capable of horrors beyond comprehension, it'll take as many monsters as we can throw at it. And that’s exactly what the Order of Alice is doing: turning humanity's worst fears into its last hope.

But you’re probably wondering why I’m telling you this. It's highly sensitive information -- classified, surely?

And you’d be right, it is. But I’m tired of secrets, and more than that, I’m tired of lies. An hour ago, I woke up in a hospital bed from a coma that stole the better part of a month from me. The doctors tell me I very nearly died. 

And all because I was lied to – betrayed by the very people I work for.

So fuck it. The Order can go straight to Hell, and so can their OPSEC. This is me being the change I wish to see in the world. This is me offering up a little transparency to the masses by telling my story, one nightmare at a time. 

I'll spare you the build-up - I’m not the hero of my story. I’m not even sure I'm the main character. All I'm sure of is that I'm an Analyst, one of hundreds employed in a labyrinth of cubicles buried a mile beneath the earth. My uniform consists of a pressed shirt and slacks, just like the rest of my cookie-cutter colleagues.  

Cosmic threats? Not on my radar. Elder Gods? Way above my pay grade.

I'm a nobody, the personification of boring. My days consist of filing paperwork, cataloguing monsters and assigning them threat classifications ranging from Bad News all the way up to Run For Your Fucking Life. 

Or at least, all that is what I used to do. 

But as is so often the case, everything changed the day I died.

It began with a distant rumble, like an elephant were marching down the corridor outside the office. Then our computer screens started going haywire. Lights flickered. One by one, my fellow Analysts began to panic.

Our supervisor, Mr. Edwards, vanished into his cubicle to contact the Inquisition, worried a Conscript might have broken loose. Most everybody else contented to take shelter beneath their desks, quietly praying to a god they didn’t believe in. 

As for me? I made a beeline for the door, engaged the lockdown mechanism, and tried not to piss myself as the footsteps halted directly outside. 

**BANG!**

**BANG!**

The knock dented the door's reinforced steel. I scrambled backward in terror, my breath caught in my throat.

# BANG!

# 

The door burst open in a shower of splintered drywall. It hung from a single hinge, a colossal shadow filling the frame behind it. The intruder's chest heaved. It took a thunderous step forward, eliciting terrified whimpers. A wicker mask covered its face, the weave flaring upward like the horns of a devil. It was clad in crimson Kevlar, with a playing card pinned to the jacket – a Jack of Clubs. 

‘An… An Overseer…’ somebody muttered, gulping loudly. 

‘B-But those things aren’t allowed up here,’ replied someone else. ‘They’re prison guards. They belong down in the Vaults, watching all the other monsters…’

‘It must’ve gone rogue…’ reasoned another voice. 

‘Jesus,’ whispered a woman, ‘does that mean it’s gonna kill us?’

Mr. Edwards strode past, a skinny man in a grey suit. 'For Heaven's sake, Julia. It's not going to kill us. It's job is protect us from the monsters below.'

Julia called after him, asking if he’d managed to contact the Inquisition about the Overseer, and Mr. Edwards shook his head. They never answered his call.

The office erupted into a panicked uproar. 

‘Relax!’ Our supervisor shouted, though his tone suggested he was far from relaxed. ‘Everybody, please calm down. We don’t need an Inquisitor.' He glanced uneasily at the Overseer. 'This is clearly just a minor misunderstanding. I’ll deal with it.’

The thin man inched forward in his ill-fitting suit, approaching the hulking intruder like a mouse might approach a tiger. ‘Good morn– err, afternoon,’ he squeaked. ‘It would appear you’ve gotten lost – understandable in such a large bunker. How about I help you back to the elevator? We’ll have you back down to the Vaults in no time.’

He smiled hopefully up at the Overseer, but the creature made no response. Mr. Edwards pulled on one of its massive arms, trying to guide it back toward the corridor, but it was like he was trying to move the limb of a statue. 'If. You'll. Please. Just. Work. With. Me. Here.'

The Overseer’s neck jerked suddenly sideways, its hollowed eyes staring directly at me. I shrank against the wall, heart pounding.

‘Levi Reyes…’ it rasped. 'Come...'

Nobody moved. Nobody so much as breathed. 

‘Wh-what?’ I stammered, jabbing a finger at my chest in disbelief. ‘Me? You want me to... to come with you?’

The Overseer nodded, its neck muscles creaking like ancient timber.

The color drained from my face. I spun around, desperately searching for somebody to help me out of this situation. ‘Mr. Edwards,' I choked out. ‘This isn’t protocol. Tell the Overseer it isn't protocol.’

The gaunt man looked like he might be sick to his stomach. To his credit, he gave another tug on the Overseer’s arm. ‘Now,' he said meekly. 'There’s no need for that, M-Mister Overseer Sir. My employee is quite fine where he is. How about you and I—’

The Overseer stepped forward, dragging Mr. Edwards behind it like he were a sheet of toilet paper stuck to its boot. ‘Levi Reyes… specifically... requested…’ It snatched me by my collar, dragging me out of the office as I flailed wildly, shouting for help. 

Nobody moved a finger. My colleagues stood idly by, watching in petrified shock as the Overseer pulled me out into the corridor, dragging me toward the waiting elevator.

‘Wait!’ Mr. Edwards shouted, scrambling after us into the corridor.  ‘Y-You can’t do this!' he said, as though he were finding his voice for the first time. 'For Heaven's sake - you can’t just kidnap Analysts from their desks! The Inquisition will hear about this, and when they do—’

The Overseer tossed me into the open elevator like a squirming sack of meat. ‘The Inquisition…’ it muttered, turning back to face Mr. Edwards with a rattling chuckle. ‘Who do you think sent me...?’

Mr. Edwards' jaw fell open. ‘No,' he said weakly. 'They wouldn’t. The Inquisition would never. Not one of our own, not unless…’

The Overseer punched the control panel, and the elevator doors began to close. ‘Inquisitor Owens...' it said coldly, 'sends her regards…’

As the doors slid shut, I watched Mr. Edwards stumble to his knees, staring after us with a look of utter horror. Only I couldn’t help but notice it wasn’t the Overseer he seemed terrified of.
