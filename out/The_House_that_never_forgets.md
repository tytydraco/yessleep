Part One: The Ones Who Tried to Take Me
(A true story from my family, told by my mother and father)

I grew up in a house that felt… wrong.

felt hunted, your new something was just off about it. Like the air inside was listening. Watching. Waiting. I didn’t know that at the time, of course. I was just a baby—barely four months old—when the first thing happened.

But my parents? They remember everything. And when they talk about that house, their voices get low. Like they don’t want it to hear them.

We lived in a two-story house in Mexico that everyone in the neighborhood called “la casa extraña.” The strange house. Not because we were rich (we weren’t), but because it looked like someone had built it without really knowing how houses should work.

It had six bedrooms, three bathrooms inside, one outside, marble floors that echoed with every step, and a balcony that stretched the full length of the front of the house, right above the garage. The stairs were wooden and wide, and they creaked like they were trying to warn you. The windows were massive-floor-to-ceiling monsters that made you feel watched even in the daytime.

And then there was the rooftop.

In Mexico, we don’t really have attics the way people do in the U.S. Instead, there’s a kind of flat rooftop space. But to get there in our house, you had to climb out a second-story window, walk a thin ledge along the outer wall, and climb a rusted metal ladder bolted into the wall. My mom always said it was off-limits. She didn’t like the rooftop.

She said it made her feel sick.

At the time of the first incident, I was the youngest of five kids. That evening, my mom was downstairs making dinner. It was a little before sunset. My siblings were still at the park with a neighbor, and I was asleep in my crib in the coldest room upstairs. Cold in a way that made no sense, even in summer. My mom used to call it “un frío raro.” A strange cold.

Because of how empty and echoey the house was, she could hear everything from the kitchen. Footsteps. Whispers. My baby cries. That’s how she says she knew something was wrong.

Only this time, it wasn’t crying she heard.

It was laughter.

Not soft baby giggles. No. My mom says it was deep, belly-shaking laughter. Wild and giddy and out of control, like I was being tickled too hard.

At first, she thought maybe I was dreaming. But then…footsteps.

She thought maybe it was my dad, home early from work. But she hadn’t heard the stairs creak. And the only way upstairs was past the kitchen. Something wasn’t adding up.

Then the laughter changed.

It turned shrill. Wet. Like crying and laughing mixed together. The sound sent chills down her spine. That was enough.

She dropped the spatula and ran.

She says she’ll never forget what she saw when she burst into the room:

I was halfway out the window. My tiny legs dangling over the edge. Four pairs of small, pale hands were gripping my arms and shoulders, tugging me toward the open air.

She screamed.

She says the things at the window weren’t children. Not really. They were small, yes, but wrong. Their faces were too stretched. Their eyes too dark. Their grins too wide. She called them duendes. Gnomes. Imps. Something out of old folklore.

And when she screamed, they pulled harder.

Panicked, she remembered my dad’s old police-issued handgun in the nightstand. She sprinted to it, grabbed it, and aimed-not at me, but toward the creatures, away from the crib.

She fired.

The sound shattered the silence.

The creatures let go of me instantly. I dropped back into the crib. She says she could hear them scurrying, their tiny feet pattering on the walls, into the ceiling, through the house like cockroaches in the walls.

She scooped me up, sobbing, and held me tight.

I had red marks on my arms. Finger shaped bruises. But I was alive.

To this day, there’s still a bullet hole in that wall.

To this day, she swears she saw them.

And she wasn’t the only one.

Part Two: The Boy in the Hallway
Years later, when I was old enough to understand, my mom told me that wasn’t the only thing that happened in that house.

There were more moments. Stranger ones. And one night in particular, one that still makes my dad’s hands shake when he retells it.

It was a Saturday evening, early 2000s. My parents had just come back from Blockbuster with a couple movies. They sent us to bed early because one of the films was rated 13+, too scary for kids. My mom doesn’t like horror, but that night she agreed to watch something spooky with my dad. Something about ghosts, maybe.

From the couch in the living room, they had a direct view of the staircase and the hallway of the first floor. At the end of that hallway was the bedroom where we were sleeping. A little way down was the bathroom.


About twenty minutes into the movie, my mom noticed something.

A figure.

Just standing by the stairs.

She thought maybe one of us had woken up to use the bathroom but was too scared to go alone. We were still little. “Hey,” she whispered to my dad, “I think one of the kids is up.”

My dad got up and walked into the hallway.

But the space was empty.

He turned on the light. Still nothing.

“There’s no one here,” he said.

My mom shrugged. “Guess I imagined it.”

But five minutes later, it happened again.

This time, she saw it clearly.

A child was standing at the end of the hallway. Hand raised. Beckoning toward the stairs.

My mom thought it was one of us trying to sneak upstairs and said, “It’s too late for you to be wandering. Go back to sleep.”

But my dad had frozen.

“That’s not one of our kids,” he whispered.

The child had on old-fashioned overalls and a striped long-sleeved shirt. Clothes none of us owned. He had a grin that stretched too wide, filled with too many teeth. His eyes were huge and unblinking, his skin too smooth and pale.

He just… stood there, smiling.

Then, without turning around, he started walking backwards up the stairs. Step by step. His eyes still locked on theirs.

When only his feet were visible, my parents exploded into motion.

My mom rushed into the bedroom to check on us. My dad ran upstairs, chasing the figure.

We were all in bed, asleep, but something was wrong.

My older brother had a bite mark on his forearm.

My sister had bruises she couldn’t explain. Ones that hadn’t been there at bedtime.

Upstairs, my dad says he heard whispers- low, muffled voices in the walls. He never found the boy. Or the source.

That night, every light in the house stayed on until morning.

They didn’t sleep.

There were other stories. So many other stories.

Guests who woke up with scratches on their arms. Plates that slid off counters on their own. My mom once heard crying from the rooftop, but when she checked, it was empty. My dad found tiny handprints on the inside of the windows. Sometimes, you’d feel something watching you from the corners. From behind the doors.

Once, I swear I heard someone whisper my name from the drain in the sink. I was eight.

Even now, years later, long after we moved, people say that house still moves at night. They say they’ve seen a boy on the stairs. That they hear footsteps above the ceiling, even when they’re alone.

Some houses forget.

But not this one.

This house?

It remembers us.

And I don’t think it ever let us go.

If you want to hear more… just ask.
There are things I still haven’t told you. Things I’m not sure I understand myself.
Because some stories?
They don’t end when you leave.
Some houses never forget.
