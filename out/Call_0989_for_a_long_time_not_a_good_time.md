“I think that might be the wrong way round,” I said, smirking.

The message had not been inked, but *engraved* into the plastic laminate partition. It’s the staple of any public bathroom stall. A mysterious phone number. One that, let’s be honest, is either false or owned by an unwilling participant of a bad practical joke. But this message was different. Unlike the other musings and doodles on the cubicle wall, it caught my eye. That’s no meagre feat, considering it was three in the morning, and ten bottles of cider were sloshing around in my belly.

It wasn’t the unbalanced handwriting that entrapped my gaze. Not even the brown trail of rust left in the grooves of the etching. So what if an inebriated moron had written his phone number with a house key? That didn’t interest me at all. No, my curiosity was piqued by the *length* of the number.

Four digits.

I didn’t ring it, of course, because I didn’t expect that the call would actually connect. However, when I really started to think about the message, concerns poisoned my intrigue. There was an omen lurking in the words. I didn’t like any of it.

Still, I shook my head, realising that my drunken mind was playing cruel tricks on me. If a not-so-sober stranger had written the message, it would make sense that he might not remember more than four digits of his number. It would make sense that he’d mix up a common saying too.

*Get a grip, scaredy-pants*, I told myself, chuckling as I struggled to aim my stream away from the toilet seat.

“The fuck are you yapping about?” Mason slurred, slipping on the damp floor as he pulled my cubicle door open.

I zipped up my jeans and grinned. “Trying to sneak a peak?”

“Keep your fantasies to yourself, Alec,” Mason said, swaying listlessly in the doorway. “Now, what were you saying, tosspot?”

“I don’t remember,” I admitted, laughing and shrugging.

“Something about the wrong…” my friend hazily began, pausing to belch. “Something was round? I don’t know.”

I slapped my head in realisation, then jabbed a pointing finger at the cubicle wall. “The *message*! I was saying it’s the wrong way round.”

Mason crouched, squinting to read it. “It’s missing, like… three numbers…”

I snorted so hard I choked. “Mason, it’s missing a few more than *that*. You’re drunk.”

“So are you!” he protested, standing up with hands on his hips, then stumbling into the opposite cubicle wall.

“True, but at least I have more than one brain cell left,” I pointed out.

“That isn’t saying much, considering you only started with two,” Mason retorted.

I laughed. “Damn.”

“Yeah,” he replied, tapping his temple with a grin. “See? Even tipsy, I’m witsy.”

“Witsy?” I asked, giggling.

“*Witty*,” he corrected.

I was searching for a smart reply when I noticed that Mason had produced his phone from the front pocket of his jeans. My inebriated friend’s bobblehead hindered his ability to focus on the screen, but I already knew from the tone of the phone’s digital clicks that he was dialling a number. A *short* number.

“You’re not serious?” I asked as the phone started to ring. “It’s not going to work.”

“We’ll see, won’t we, Mr Smart Alec?” Mason asked, mashing the phone against sweaty hair in a completely failed attempt to meet his ear. “That name hits the spot every time.”

“Yeah?” I scoffed, rocking from side to side. “So does your mum.”

My friend laughed, shoving me into the green, rickety wall of the cubicle. “My mum’s too wonderful for you.”

“*You’re too wonderful for you.”*

The phone had barely stopped ringing when the response sounded through the speaker. I heard the voice with such clarity that I twisted my head to ensure the responder hadn’t appeared in the cubicle.

As my friend and I locked eyes, I knew that we felt the same chilling sensation. The same chilling *realisation*.

Mason should not have called that number.

“Who is this?” my friend calmly asked, struggling to sober himself up.

“*Who is this?”* the voice parroted, speaking in a misshapen way.

Mason started to pant, his chest bloating and compressing rapidly as he trembled on the spot. I tried to control my own breathing. I knew why were both so afraid. There was background noise behind the voice on the other end of the phone. And that sharp, spiky audio wasn’t the result of poor reception. Something was hidden in the static of the call.

“Hang up,” I told my friend.

I reached towards the phone in Mason’s hand, but he retracted it and shook his head at me in absolute terror, as if to say that ending the call would be a dreadful idea. As if he were hearing *more* than me. And I wonder, sometimes, whether he’d simply been trying to stop me from hearing it too.

I trusted my friend, as I’d never seen him that way. He was possessed by terror that surpassed even my own, and I’d *certainly* never been so frightened in my life. His transformation became fully apparent when a drunken pub-goer stumbled into the bathroom. The barfly locals call Barmy Barry, but only because he does, in fact, act a little barmy if we don’t call him that.

“Fuck off, Barmy!” Mason yelled.

The old, dishevelled gentleman wore a matching waistcoat and corduroy trousers, as if he were either attending a funeral or preparing to perform amateur magic. And knowing Barmy Barry, he may well have been doing both. I was actually relieved to see him. Relieved to be drawn back into the real world and forget, for a second, the unsettling nature of the phone call.

“What are you boys doing in here?” the grumbling man mumbled as he walked towards our cubicle.

“Blow,” I joked.

“You’re blowing each other?” Barmy Barry gasped.

I sighed. “No, Barry, it’s… Never mind.”

“*Barmy* Barry,” he corrected.

“Just get out of here,” my friend icily ordered.

Barmy Barry narrowed his eyes. “I’m going to tell Michele that you two are up to no good. I’ll be back to check on you if you haven’t left in a few minutes. And then I’m taking a piss, okay? Once you’ve calmed down.”

“Bye, Bazza,” I said as the man exited the room.

My friend summoned a deep breath.

“It was only Barry,” I said, before gulping. “Just… hang up the phone. We don’t need to keep talking to him.”

“*Who is this?”* the phone voice repeated with that horridly unnatural timbre.

Mason ignored me and started to reply. “This is—”

“*This is Mason,”* the voice interrupted, answering its own question.

The two of us quaked in the bathroom stall. Nobody had revealed my friend’s name. Not me. Not Barmy Barry. Yet, this mysterious voice *knew*.

I pleaded with silent eyes for Mason to hang up the phone. To my surprise, in spite of the unwilling look on his face, my friend nodded. But as he started to lower the device from his ear, the voice on the other end spoke again.

“*Why are you listening to Alec? Don’t you want to enjoy a long time?”* it whispered.

Before either of us responded to the voice, the door to the bathroom stall swung closed, sweeping my friend out of the cubicle with unholy force.

“*Mason!”* I bellowed, instantly grabbing the handle.

Something was wrong. I sensed it before I’d even opened the door. Sensed, somehow, that I would be facing a new land when I stepped outside.

I was both right and wrong.

The grimy, stained, neglected bathroom still stood before me, but its pieces had been scrambled. Ahead was a familiar set of sinks, but the row stretched much farther than before, much like the line of cubicles beside me. And when I twisted to face what should have been the room’s far end, I found only a long tunnel. The two walls, lined with sinks and stalls, were no longer straight and finite. They curved sharply to the right, and whatever lay around the corner was just out of sight.

“Alec?” a familiar voice cried, echoing through the infinite room.

My chest tightened.

“Mason?” I replied, voice cracking as it barrelled down the tiled chamber ahead.

There did not come a second response from my friend. However, a few seconds later, the sound of a shutting door travelled down the tunnel towards me, seemingly carried by a far-off breeze. It became clear that I wouldn’t find the bathroom’s end once I rounded the corner. A thought confirmed when I finally took ginger steps out of the cubicle, skidding slightly in the same mystery puddle that had nearly claimed my friend.

And after following the curving tunnel for only a few steps, I saw that I was correct. The bathroom continued ceaselessly. The two side walls did not meet an end-wall. I did not see an exit beside the last cubicle on the right, for there seemed to *be* no last cubicle on the right. All that awaited was a never-ending passageway of sinks and stalls.

I didn’t want to follow the bend. I had a feeling that I should wait in the first cubicle for the nightmare to pass. But I knew, if I were to do that, I would be turning my back on Mason.

As I walked farther and farther from the faux safety I’d felt in the initial cubicle, I tried to focus on my trainers clapping against damp tiles. But the persistent echoes of distant noises drowned each step, no matter how heavily I walked.

Far-flung faucets gushed. Poorly-oiled stall hinges groaned. Doors locked and *unlocked*. Every sound typical of a public bathroom, which would have been banal in any other circumstance, seemed to excavate a fresh layer of fear from the pit of my stomach. I held my sanity together with duct-tape and faith. Faith that I would find my friend. Faith that we would escape.

It was when a *not*-so-distant sound emerged that I finally unravelled.

Only three or four cubicles ahead, a stall door closed. But not before I had a chance to scream at the sight of translucent fingers gripping the plastic. The invisible skin revealed cobwebs of arteries beneath the flesh and the green of the door on the other side. Each finger unwrapped from the edge of the door, one by one, before it closed.

I shivered on the spot, fully prepared to turn on my heel and run back to the starting cubicle, but I was close to finding Mason. Not that I had a sixth sense. It was more that something in the never-ending bathroom, likely the voice behind 0989, had shown me the way.

I pressed forwards, being sure to keep my eyes ahead and avoid the cubicle that housed the translucent creature. But I felt something peeking through the gap alongside the door hinge. Felt eyes upon me as I passed the occupied stall. Eyes or something worse. I only know that its gaze was *tangible*. A look that punctured my flesh and injected my body with a chill that froze the very tears forming in my eyes.

And to exacerbate the horror, as I continued to walk, there came a shape, either a shadow or some black spectre, which slipped around the corner ahead. Just past my field of view. Whether a shadow or not, I had no doubt that it had been *very* real.

Then I saw what I had never expected to see. Not the force behind this madness, but the end of the tunnel. An end to the march.

The far bathroom wall loomed ahead, and, given that I finally saw the last cubicle on the right, I prayed that the exit would stand just beyond it. But what mostly caught my attention was the man facing the exit. The man with a phone pressed to his ear.

“Mason?” I whispered.

A dissonant melody, played by what sounded like a violin submerged in water, sounded from the device in my friend’s shaking hand. But what frightened me more was that Mason looked different. His stubble had flourished into a beard. In the revealing glow of the room’s fluorescent light, there even seemed to be wisps of white in there. The same was true of the matted hair on his head.

My friend was older. *Impossibly* older.

*It’s an illusion*, I told myself, quivering on the spot. *Has to be.*

“I’m on hold…” Mason quietly told me, continuing to face the closed exit ahead. “Any year now, he’ll answer. You watch, Alec. You watch.”

*Year?* I fearfully wondered.

“Let’s get out here,” I urged, trying to ignore the impossibilities stacking up before me. “The door is right there.”

“*We don’t want to open that, Alec,”* my friend replied in a low tone borrowed from somewhere dark.

Mason’s sudden composure terrified me. His trembling had ceased, and I clamped my jaw shut in response. Then, once I stopped shaving away enamel with my fearful grinding, I realised that 0989’s hold music had stopped.

There came a voice from the phone’s speaker to confirm that.

“*I’m here, Mason,”* the inhuman voice announced in a sing-song timbre. *“Thanks for holding.”*

The exit clicked open.

I saw only the edge of the door swing past the corner of the final cubicle, but that was a blessing. I know that I was fortunate to not see whatever stood, sat, or hovered in the doorway. To not see what Mason saw. His expression told me that. Even the most expressive face should not be able to convey such a level of fright.

I’m glad I didn’t look at my friend’s eyes. I fear that I would have seen a reflection of whatever revealed itself in the open exit.

“Oh…” Mason knowingly said.

But my friend’s sole word did not slip into silence at the natural stopping point. The utterance was dragged out like some zombified moan from the oblivion of a brainless skull. Mason was gone. There was nothing left of him upstairs. Nothing worth salvaging after his very sense of self had been obliterated by a terror too great for human eyes.

Then came the nightmare.

“NO!” I shrieked.

But it had already happened. With inhuman speed, my friend raised fingers to his eyes and started to *claw* with long nails. The two of us screamed in unison as he tore into his retinas, but he kept going. Did not stop. He tore until bloody ribbons spilled from the mush-filled sockets. He tore with no sense of self-preservation. Only the maddening desire to never see a single thing again. And that was clearly a gift to Mason, as it would prevent him from *ever* having to see the source of the voice again. From ever having to see what stood in the doorway again.

Ten seconds later, long after my oldest friend had rid himself of his vision, he finally stopped clawing. Mason sighed with relief, painting his face with a wide smile. He seemed, somehow, to be in *less* pain than before.

“*That’s better,”* he said.

But it wasn’t Mason. It wasn’t anyone I knew at all.

I screamed for the tenth consecutive time, lungs starting to give out, but my friend did not turn to face me with his eyeless, blood-strewn face. Did not utter parting words to someone who’d been his friend since childhood. He walked towards the exit, then the door slammed shut behind him, welcoming Mason into an unknown world with an unknown thing.

The same door flung open a second later, and a grey-haired man, wearing Windsor glasses, burst into the bathroom.

“What the fuck is happening in here?” Barmy Barry cried. “Alec? Why are you crying?”

I turned around, cheeks painted with tears and snot, to find no curving tunnel behind me. The bathroom had returned to normal.

But Mason was [gone](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
