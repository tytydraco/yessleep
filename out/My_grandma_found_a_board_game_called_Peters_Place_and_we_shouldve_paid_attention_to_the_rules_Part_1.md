**Part I** - [Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1e9g7fp/my_grandma_found_a_board_game_called_peters_place/)

“I bought this at a charity shop on Market Street,” She squealed excitably. “It looked like something you two would love!”

The rigid, cardboard box, far too firm for its apparent age, was marked with a black, serif font that read: “Peter’s Place”. The cover image depicted a titchy, plastic figure, painted purple, striding slowly forwards. A figure seemingly disinterested in the several white, plastic figures pursuing it at a far greater pace. And every character powered towards a nearly-nondescript house in the distance. Little more than a childlike outline of a home. A triangular roof, four windows, and a door.

The picture contained some indistinguishable shapes of various muted colours. Despite the mint condition of the cardboard, its weathered ink told the truth. There persisted a persuasion, moving towards the forefront of my mind, that the faded cover had lost some of its imagery to time. Lost secrets that, perhaps, would’ve told us much more about the ancient game.

Would’ve told us, perhaps, never to play it.

Grandma proudly placed the game on the coffee table, and I offered my younger sister the Krasinski Smirk, as if smugly eyeballing some hidden camera. She stifled laughter behind bubbling lips, and our grandmother obliviously settled into an armchair. It pains me to sound like a brain-rotted adolescent, but Mikayla and I haven’t ever enjoyed board games, so I wondered why Grandma had presumed otherwise. Still, I felt shameful for thinking that way. I knew better.

Around the time I went to university, and my sister entered sixth-form, the Templeman family adopted a new, stilted dynamic. Mum and Dad changed. At first, I thought it had something to do with my sister and I embracing new phases of life. However, a few months ago, our parents finally revealed that Grandma was displaying some early signs of vascular dementia.

We hadn’t been too surprised. During the holidays, Mikayla and I often spent a few days at our grandmother’s house, and we’d noticed her cognitive decline over the years. With this new knowledge, of course, we realised it was more serious than that. We realised our time with her was precious and fleeting, so we would’ve done anything to make her remaining days pleasant. Whether it had been a three-hour marathon of Antiques Roadshow or an evening of some dull board game.

“What are the rules, Emmett?” Grandma asked me.

I lifted the lid, wincing as it loudly scraped against the sides of the box. For a moment, I almost needed to *strain*, as if the lid were wrestling with me. As if it were unwilling to reveal what lay beneath. But it eventually came free.

“You need to hit the gym, Spaghetti Limbs,” Mikayla laughed.

I unleashed a backhanded swing, thumping my sister on the nose with the cover of the box, and she recoiled.

“Behave, children…” Grandma tutted, before her eyes suddenly glazed. “Where did you get this game? It looks fun!”

I sighed, feeling the mood in the room lower. “It was, erm… You bought it for us, Grandma.”

“Oh,” She softly responded, before clearing her throat uncomfortably. “Yes, that’s right. Sorry. So, let’s start, shall we?”

“I just need to read the rules first,” I chuckled.

“*And* you need to explain them to us, you dirty cheater,” Mikayla added.

“I *will*,” I said, rolling my eyes. “I’ll repeat them word for word, and you’ll spend about twenty minutes reading the entire rulebook just to check I didn’t lie to you.”

“Sounds about right,” Mikayla nodded.

“Then one of you will have to read them aloud a second time because I’ll have forgotten,” Grandma giggled.

My sister and I laughed along, but there was a hint of sadness in that moment of joy. Grandma’s wit still cut sharply, whenever it poked above ground, but that edge had become blunter over the months. It was a side of her, much like *all* sides of her, that we rarely saw after the diagnosis. Whatever remained of ‘Grandma’, in terms of who we knew, was slowly dying. Grief is torturous when the body, but not the mind, of a loved one lingers before you. For there may still be moments of that person you used to know. Painful reminders of that gradual deterioration.

To fill the pained pause that followed the round of laughter, I explained the rules.

***Peter’s Place***

*The House is home. The place which safeguards all that is dear to you. All that you wish to hold and never let go.*

*You have been displaced, and you must return to your pleasant abode. However, you are not the only one with eyes on that shining beacon in the darkness. Peter has seen that you have woken far from home, and he hungrily eyes this opportunity to take everything you love.*

*You and your teammates, each moving a white piece one or two squares per turn, must work together to reach The House. At the end of each round, when all players have taken a turn, Peter, depicted by the purple piece, will move one square closer to the same destination.*

*You win if every teammate reaches The House before him. You lose if it becomes Peter’s Place.*

*You may be faster, but he is far more cunning. Peter knows that legs grow weary. The journey will weather you, perhaps even taking everything. Peter, on the other, cannot be slowed. Cannot be stopped. He moves steadily.*

*Every turn, you will move in whichever direction you so please. There are many possible routes. Always the same destination. However, to win, every single player must reach The House before Peter.*

*After moving your piece, you will pick up an Item card, adding it to your collection, and a Choice card. The cards must correspond with the colour, either red or green, of the square on which you land. If you land on an Event square, you must also draw a corresponding Event card.*

*If a player reaches The House, Item and Choice cards do not need to be drawn. However, if all players have crossed the line, draw one final Event card to determine your victory or failure. It may be red or green.*

*This is no game of chance. No matter the situation presented, you decide the route.*

*Peter is an ambitious man. Peter is an acquisitive man. Peter is, above all else, a self-serving man. To him, a house is not a home. It is food. And he will stop at nothing to take it from you. To take everything from you. Understand that you may win today, but nothing lasts forever. One day, the coarse sands of time will rot your door to the ground.*

*One day, Peter will have his place.*

*When all players are ready, The House will open, and the game will begin.*

Grandma sighed. “Whew! That was a mighty mouthful.”

“Most of it simply set the scene. The rules actually seem quite straightforward,” I assured her. “I know it’s a strategy game, but it’ll be easier than chess. Think of it that way, Grandma. You’re good at chess.”

“Plus, we all have to work together, so we’ll help you,” Mikayla added. “And we won’t have to worry about Emmett cheating to beat us.”

“What sparked this ‘Emmett is a cheater’ crusade?” I asked, laughing.

“Monopoly. 2015. Mayfair-gate,” My sister bluntly explained.

I snorted even louder. “I was ten years old!”

“You put five houses on it, Emmett. *FIVE!*” Mikayla barked. “The max is four, and you *know* it. You knew it then too.”

“Nobody stopped me,” I shrugged, grinning. “It’s a good life lesson, Mikayla. You’ve got to keep your eye on the ball, y’know? Property development is a ruthless game.”

My sister huffed whilst unpacking the box. She started to unfold a large cardboard square onto the carpet, revealing an entanglement of various cross junctions and overlapping routes. There were dozens of ways to reach the plain, two-storey house with no discernible features. Some roads passed through a dense woodland, and others passed through an abandoned town. My eyes wandered across different passages, trying to ascertain which pathway would be the quickest.

The most direct route to The House squeezed between the woodland and the town. However, I counted a greater number of green than red squares on the tempting route, and something told me that green might bring far worse odds. *Peter’s Place* unnerved me for a reason I did not understand. I found myself not wanting to eye the board for a prolonged period of time.

“What have you got in your hands, Emmett?” Grandma asked, waking me from the trance.

I’d been so transfixed that I forgot I’d plucked an old, cotton bag from the box. I loosened the drawstring to find a dusty heap of plastic figurines at the bottom. Three white and one purple. As I removed them from the bag, hand trembling, my sister laughed.

“What are the odds? It’s as if it were *made* for us,” She said.

Something about that sent shivers down my spine, though I internally chastised myself for being frightened by a coincidence. I was trying to make sense of the fear response within my body. Embarrassed that I was growing increasingly afraid of something as banal as a board game.

There were starting squares in the bottom corners of the board. One on the far left, for the main players, and one on the far right, for Peter. I placed the three white pieces, who were frozen in sprinting poses, on our starting square. And the purple figurine, frozen in a brisk walking pose, was placed on the opposing square. At Peter’s feet, a purple-squared route led to The House, circumventing both the woods and the town. No obstacles. No great rush needed. He would creep to the same destination as us, one square at a time.

“We’re in a hurry, aren’t we?” Grandma laughed, picking up one of the white figurines and admiring it. “It’s been quite a few years since I was able to run like this.”

“And look at Peter,” Mikayla said, pointing at the figurine. “He’s hardly even trying.”

“Are we ready to start?” I asked. “Or would we rather watch TV?”

“The television set will be there in an hour or so,” Grandma said. “Let’s play.”

“Bold of you to think we’ll finish that quickly,” Mikayla said. “Who goes first?”

Given my churning gut, I wanted to refuse, but I knew my grandmother might have very few lucid days left. I realised we had to cherish nights like that one.

*Soon, she might not be able to play board games at all*, I thought. *Soon, she might not even recognise my face.*

“It doesn’t say,” I eventually replied. “Grandma, do you want to start? We’ll go clockwise. You, Mikayla, me, then… Peter.”

“Sure,” Grandma smiled. “You’ll have to move the piece for me though. It’ll hurt my back to keep clambering out of this chair.”

“Of course,” I said, lifting one of the white pieces.

There came a sharp click from the hallway, startling the three of us, and our eyes shot to the back door, which stood ajar. A moment later, we were all laughing at our skittish reactions.

“Well, I suppose that means the game begins,” Mikayla said.

“Sorry, dearies,” Grandma apologised. “That latch has been on the blink for *eons*.”

“I’ll shut it,” I said.

“Oh, don’t bother, Emmett! The door will only do it again,” She called as I bounded into the hallway.

I closed the unlatched back entrance, and my eyes were drawn to the patterned glass, which barely allowed any visibility of the field beyond Grandma’s cosy back garden. But my gaze met something in the distance, illuminated by the dusky, red light of that strange time post-sunset. A being hid in the forest. Dark and shapeless, watching me with eyes that could not be seen. Driven by some force beyond me, I opened my mouth to release a soundless scream. Terrified and helpless in the face of whatever surveyed me.

“Emmett?” Mikayla shouted from the living room. “Are we playing or not?”

My lips sharply rejoined, and I controlled my breathing, wondering what I’d just experienced. Wondering how to rationally explain it to myself, given that I’d never suffered from any mental illness. Given that I’d never believed in anything beyond what could be seen, heard, smelt, or touched. But on that night, I did not doubt that something lurked in the forest. Something with intent neither cruel nor kind. Something that did not feel at all.

“Which way would you like to move?” I asked quietly as I re-entered the room.

“Oh, I don’t know,” Grandma chuckled. “Towards those lovely trees, perhaps.”

I nodded, sitting on the carpet and veiling my emotions, as I did not want to be teased for odd behaviour. “One square or two squares?”

“Why, two, of course! The faster we win, the better!” Grandma said.

I pushed her piece forwards, and she landed on a green square in the forest. As I reached towards the green pile of Item cards, I still struggled to shake the feeling that red would be safer. But it had to be tested.

I was relieved, and slightly amused, to read the Item card that I had drawn for my grandmother. It depicted a rectangular wrapper branded with the words: ‘Bransgrove Oats’.

“You’ve earnt yourself a ‘Chocolate Bar’,” I laughed, handing the item to her.

Grandma gleefully took the card, squinting through reading glasses to inspect it for herself. Her strong smile gradually softened into something level. Something cold. I’d never seen her that way. She was only ever bright and jovial. A woman who always radiated warmth. But as her sunny disposition departed, a chill swept over my flesh, riddling it with goosebumps.

My sister drew a green Choice card from the top of the pile and read it quietly.

“What does it say?” I croaked.

“You wade through a stodgy puddle clogged by brittle flakes. It is far deeper than expected. The liquid rises above your frail ankles, threatening to swallow you. Do you jump out and skirt around the pool, moving one square backwards? Or do you risk seizing a nearby branch to free yourself, moving one square forwards and adding this Choice card to your personal supply?”

“I object to the notion that I have frail ankles,” Grandma gasped, bending forwards with a wince and scratching the fabric of her left sock. “Oh, I don’t know. I’m in no hurry. I’ll step out of the puddle.”

I nodded, moving her piece one square backwards. “Seems like the safer option to me.”

“Really? There didn’t seem to be any downside to pushing forwards,” Mikayla said.

“It said that she’d keep the Choice card,” I pointed out. “I have a hunch that we might be punished for having certain things in our supplies. Who knows what we’ll draw later?”

“The rules didn’t mention that,” My sister replied.

*This game has unwritten rules*, I thought to myself, shuddering as the darkness of the woods filled my fractured mind.

“Whatever. Peter’s slow, isn’t he? Right, it’s my turn!” Mikayla said, eagerly pushing her piece two squares along a different route. “Makes sense to try another way. And I’ll pick up this red Item card… Oh, wow. A shovel.”

“Maybe you’ll dig us out of some dire situation,” I suggested, trying to perk up.

She grinned. “Or I’ll hit you over the head with it if you annoy me. Anyway, let me read this Choice card… You find a bicycle propped against a nearby tree. Do you take it, moving forward an extra two squares, or leave it, staying on your present square?”

“Leave it,” I said.

Mikayla rolled her eyes. “You’re no fun. We’ll be playing until sunrise at this rate.”

“It seems risky. If you move two squares forwards, you’ll land on an Event space,” I said, pointing at the board.

“So? Why are you assuming that Events would be bad?” My sister asked, pushing her piece forwards. “I take the bicycle. And I guess I’ll be picking up a red Event card. Here we go…”

My eyes started to lose focus at the edges, and my throat elongated, simultaneously concrete yet elastic. I realised that I hadn’t breathed in roughly twenty seconds. I’d been watching Mikayla with a horrified expression as she silently read the card, without revealing her thoughts.

“What does it say, dear?” Grandma asked, smiling in a way that implied she’d forgotten whatever unnerved her.

“You become distracted by something in the forest,” My sister eventually said. “You see a lamb, entirely out of place, being circled by wild foxes. The predators viciously tear the helpless creature limb from woolly limb. You are so distracted, in fact, that you miss your following turn. And Peter smiles. After all players have finished this round, he will take *two* steps forwards.”

“I *told* you,” I sighed.

Mikayla shrugged. “It’ll be fine. He’s still slow.”

I smiled weakly, struggling to conceal the burgeoning dread in my body. My turn had finally arrived. I scanned the board, unsure as to which route would be the safest. I was starting to suspect that there may *be* no safe routes, so I followed my sister’s lead. I took yet another path, pushing my white figurine two squares to the right. Heading towards the abandoned town. As I neared Peter’s purple path, a shiver coursed through my form, from top to toe, and I was certain that I felt a fourth presence in the room.

Certain that I heard breathing in the lounge’s empty corner.

Haunted, but outwardly composed, I kept playing. Told myself that I’d started hallucinating. Told myself that there may be a leak in the house. I almost excused myself to inspect Grandma’s carbon monoxide alarm.

I had landed on a red square, which felt *safer*, though I wasn’t entirely sure. I berated myself for fearing a simple game as I picked up a red item. The adrenaline left my body as I read the mundane card. After a few awful seconds of bracing for terror, it was wonderful to feel such a sweet release.

“It’s a torch,” I laughed, flashing the card at everyone.

A perfectly ordinary item. Nothing that upset me as much as a chocolate bar. Of course, I reminded myself that Grandma wasn’t well, and that helped to settle my anxious waters as I reached for a Choice card.

“You find yourself in… an empty town,” I started, frowning as I wondered how the card coincidentally correlated to the route I had taken.

“Go on,” My sister laughed. “You’re such a slow reader.”

“Sorry,” I said, clearing my throat. “You find yourself in an empty town. Excited to have reached somewhere, you run forwards. Move an extra two squares. Your excitement fades as you realise drapes are drawn, cars are nowhere to be seen, and every inch of the place appears, upon first glance, to be uninhabited. But you enter a small store and find a crying girl, palms digging into her eyes.”

“Sounds like every girl’s reaction to you, Emmett,” Mikayla giggled.

“Shut up,” I said, pushing my piece an extra two squares forwards. “As you get closer, you realise she is not crying with sadness, but *joy*. Today is a good day. Her face is nothing but a beaming smile, and she finally removes her hands to ask what you would like. Do you ask the girl to call a taxi for you, missing your next turn, but moving forwards an extra five spaces? Or do you buy some things from the shop, picking up two extra Item cards?”

“I vote that you call the taxi,” Mikayla said. “What do you think, Grandma?”

“Sorry?” Grandma asked, eyes suddenly returning to us. “I lost myself for a second. What’s happening?”

“Don’t worry, Grandma,” I said, turning my attention to Mikayla. “If I call the taxi, I progress five spaces to… a green square.”

“You really think the colours matter, don’t you?” My sister asked. “This is a game of chance, not just strategy. Each coloured pile has good *and* bad cards.”

“We don’t know that,” I said, reaching towards the red pile of items. “I choose to buy some things from the shop… I’ve got a blanket and a tyre iron. Great additions to my collection.”

“Weird things for the same shop to sell, but okay,” Mikayla replied. “Right, so we’ve all finished our turns. Round one over. Let’s move Pete.”

I half-expected the purple figurine to walk of its own accord, striding to the measured rhythm of some tribal tom-toms. However, I heard only the beat of my overworked heart as my sister pushed Peter two squares forwards. No drums, and no sign of Robin Williams.

“Before we continue, I think I should take a trip to the loo,” Grandma said, grunting as she braced herself on both armrests of the chair.

“I’ll take you,” Mikayla said, abruptly standing and catching the game’s empty box with her foot.

“Careful,” I said, as the cardboard flipped.

“Oh, shoot,” Grandma said as my sister helped her out of the room. “We should really think about dinner, shouldn’t we?”

“Emmett said he’ll get a takeaway for us,” Mikayla replied. “It’s late though. You’re right.”

“I’ll do that now,” I distantly said, eyeing the underside of the box.

As my grandma slowly exited the room, arm supported by my sister, I closely observed the overturned cardboard. Hastily etched into the back, seemingly with the sharp edge of a blade, was a message.

*Can’t kill it.*

*Don’t play it.*

There was an unsettling urgency to the penmanship, or swordsmanship, of the message’s anonymous author. It would be rational to interpret the words as evidence of the previous owner’s bizarre sense of humour. Still, that wasn’t what I believed, though you may well be tiring of me saying such things without any notable evidence.

I simply wanted to delay telling the story of what happened after I staggered across the driveway, sweat cascading down my temple, and slumped into my car. But I will tell you. I *must*.

Mikayla and I, usually without our parents, visited Grandma often. And the nearby village, like so many secluded parts of Wales, had always been a sleepy, idyllic place. A place mostly inhabited by petrels, not people. However, on that game night, a little after dusk, the town’s character changed. The sleeping land had perished entirely.

Still haunted by what I’d read on the back of the box, it took a few seconds to process the new air in the village. As I followed skeletal roads, I almost forgot why I’d come to the town, but a gurgling stomach reminded me. Whether the pang had been a sign of hunger or fear, I still do not know. What I wanted, more than anything, was to turn around, return to Grandma’s house, and scorch the game until all that remained were ashes.

*Can’t kill it.*

As I pulled into the car park of the local supermarket, I inwardly repeated that sentence. The haunting shapes of those letters were engraved into both the box and my eyes. A deranged scrawl, searing holes into my retinas. I was so afraid that I hardly noticed my surroundings, which still leaves me thankful. Thankful that I may well have overlooked certain horrors.

The ones I *did* witness were terrible enough.

The shop’s glass panes released a white glow onto the streets. A glimmer of hope in that dark place. Yet, my dread grew as I neared the automatic doorway. And when I entered the supermarket, much to my displeasure, I found nobody. Around eight on a warm Saturday evening, in the middle of spring, the local store was *empty*.

*It’s a small town*, I reminded myself. *What is wrong with you tonight? Get a grip.*

A sudden vibration stuck my side with a hot poker, and I jolted before reaching into my jacket pocket. Often, I barely notice the sound of my phone. On this night, however, the metallic buzz echoed loudly down the silent aisle. Though, as I rustled around to retrieve my phone, I convinced myself that I had heard a distant door swinging.

“Hi, *Idiot*,” I answered.

“Woah, why are you so grumpy?” Mikayla asked.

“Because this town’s dead,” I replied.

“You’re only supposed to be grabbing food, not finding a nightclub,” My sister said.

“Yeah, well, you’re slowing me down,” I pointed out as I entered the aisle for frozen food. “What do you want?”

“Grandma took her turn,” Mikayla said. “And I had to skip mine, remember? So it’s you to go. What do you want to do?”

I scoffed. “Didn’t want to wait for me, huh? Just move my piece through the town.”

“How many squares? I hate to tell you that the next few… are all *green*,” She teased.

“Better make it two squares, then,” I absently replied, trying to ignore the awful atmosphere in the supermarket.

“Right, well, I’ll pick up the *dreaded* green item for you,” Mikayla said, pausing for a few seconds. “See, why were you worrying? You got a broadsword!”

I laughed, momentarily forgetting my unease. “What the *fuck* am I going to do with a broadsword?”

“Sword stuff,” My sister said.

“Broad stuff?” I asked.

“Exactly,” She replied. “Right, Grumpy. Choice card. You pass a red lake at great pace, moving an extra two squares forwards. You grimace at the unknown liquid beside you, and hands emerge from the depths. You watch as two drowning souls burst through the surface, begging to be rescued. Do you save the rabid fox or the lamb?”

“That’s all it says?” I asked, wondering about rewards and punishments.

“That’s all it says,” Mikayla answered.

I sighed, eyeing a neat stack of Margherita pizzas in the supermarket’s freezer. “Well, I don’t see how it affects the game, but I suppose I… should save the lamb? Yes, I’ll save the lamb.”

“Cool,” My sister said. “Well, it’s your go, Grandma. Hurry up and come home, Emmett. I don’t want to call you every time it’s your turn.”

“Am I on Speaker?” I asked.

“No…” She uncertainly replied.

“How is Grandma?” I found myself querying quietly, thinking about the ‘Bransgrove Oats’ bar.

“Oh,” Mikayla said. “Yeah, she’s… She’s fine. Still seems aware enough to play. It was sad that she forgot even buying the game, wasn’t it?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Does she still seem happy? Not just lucid. I mean… Does she look *uncomfortable* at all?”

“She’s fine, Emmett,” My sister promised. “She probably just wants some food, eh? Yeah, in fact, she says, ‘My stomach is growling rather loudly.’ Oh… Grandma just told me off for being cheeky.”

I laughed. “That’s karma. All right. See you soon.”

After the call ended, I picked up three pizzas and swiftly returned to reality. The icy reality of a silent supermarket in a silent town.

Fear crept back into my bones as I passed a dozen hollow aisles, each scorched by the battering glare of overhead lights. I thought of the way that place had lured me inside. The only light in the dark. However, with nothing to accompany me but blinding lights and the muted hum of refrigerators, I started to long for the safety of the shadows. Started to feel exposed in the well-lit supermarket, and I still hadn’t shaken that idea of being *eyeballed* by something.

Then, when I reached the self-checkout registers at the far end of the store, something unexpected met my gaze. A bawling woman, face buried in her hands, wearing a bright-red uniform and a name tag with illegible text. I was not relieved to see another human, and that had nothing to do with the shop worker’s tears. I’m an empathetic man, but the crying lady sparked no natural, human instinct to rush forwards and comfort her. For I sensed she *wasn’t* human.

Too frightened to make sudden movement, I feigned ignorance and scanned my pizzas, trying to hide trembling hands. However, I struggled to ignore the woman. I wanted to shoot past her without uttering a word. Straight out of the shop, to my car, then home. But I did something foolish. Something that defied my will. Something *habitual*.

“Are you okay?” I weakly asked, clutching my bag tightly.

At that moment, standing only a few yards away from her, I realised that she was laughing through the tears. Well, it was something *adjacent* to laughter. Something so close to an emotion that one might call happiness, but not really an emotion at all. That smile, peeking from beneath her hands, was a *warning*. And I realised, as much as I wanted to stay calm, that I had to *move*. I veered to the side of the woman, but she sharply lowered her hands as I passed.

I yelled.

Above the worker’s drooling grin, shadowed by a brow ridge, there were *skin-covered dips* that did not house eyes. And a nose that was a misshapen lump, merging with the taut flesh of pale cheeks.

*Her face is nothing but a beaming smile.*

The words from that Choice card pounded in my head. As I had known, on some sub-conscious level, before arriving in the town, there was something wrong with the game. Something that had spilled into *reality*.

The woman started to laugh manically, entire body twitching, then she pounced. I yelped as her hand swiped at me, catching my wrist. Then I turned, blood staining my sleeve, and ran through the store.

“*What would you like*?” She hysterically cried, audibly closing the distance between us. “*I’ll see whether we have it in the back*.”

My legs ached from over-exertion as I burst through the automatic doors, followed by an otherworldly cackle that escaped the supermarket. I ran to the car, fumbling with my keys, then clumsily opened the door and jumped into the driver’s seat. As I locked everything, I expected to lift my head and face the inhuman shop worker. Sprawled on my bonnet or pressed against the side window.

However, the abomination had not left the store. And more eerily than that, the building had plunged into darkness, much like the rest of the town.

The dim moon, and the soft hue of my car’s headlights, offered the only illumination in town as I burnt tarmac in an eager exit. It was as I left the village that my eyes caught something in the rear-view mirror. A fleeting shape that I viewed as a trick of the mind, much like whatever else I had experienced.

The dark outline of a man, hundreds of yards behind my car, striding with purpose down the middle of the road.

My eyes shot back to the windscreen, and I attempted to control my breathing, but as I followed empty country roads back to Grandma’s house, an unwelcome thought entered my mind. The possibility that the three of us may be the only living people left on Earth. Given what I had experienced, that idea did not seem deranged.

In fact, I fearfully wondered whether we were still on Earth at [all](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
