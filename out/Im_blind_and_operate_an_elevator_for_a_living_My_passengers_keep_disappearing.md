Last year, when my ten year prison "stint" was finally up, and I re-entered society, I encountered some... obstacles.

Obstacles like... Lack of upward mobility. Prejudices and stigmas. Wages and earnings lower than the general population. Undesirable and oftentimes dangerous jobs. And lack of protection from wrongful termination.

Not to mention, an already tough job market, and the fact that my parole required that I maintain steady employment, or face re-incarceration.

Which is why, when I finally got a job offer, after six months of aggressive job hunting, I jumped at the opportunity, giving absolutely no fucks as to how I was actually making ends meet.

"Ever operate a freight elevator before?" Mr. Winfred, the manager of "The Cornelius" and my new boss, asked me my first day on the job.

"No, sir." I replied honestly, as I ran my fingers along the doors of the antiquated contraption, the only remaining evidence of the recently renovated luxury building's ancient past.

"Normally these old things aren't used for passengers, but the building's pretentious designers thought it might add a certain charm to its otherwise sterile decor. Which is where you come in." He continued, as I heard him slide open the freight elevator's outside doors...

SLAM!

...Followed by its scissored metal inside doors.

SCREEEECH!

I heard Mr. Winfred step inside and, using my cane, scanned the interior of the rather large elevator, which must have been eight feet by eight feet, and followed him in.

Instantly, my nose was hit with an overpowering, musty scent, like the kind you'd smell in a basement, combined with your grandmother's attic.

He then closed both doors behind us.

SLAM!

SCREEEECH!

"Now this here." Mr Winfred added, taking my hand and placing it on the handle of a lever, "Is how you move the elevator from floor to floor. Up for up. Down for down. You'll hear a click when you reach each floor, which will be helpful for someone like yourself." He said, clearly calling attention to the fact that I'm blind.

*Someone like myself?* I scoffed internally. You ignorant, entitled piece of shit.

Truth is, I've always had a bit of a short fuse. Which I guess, looking back on it, is what got me into prison in the first place.

But in my ten years of incarceration, I was given tools to combat my anger issues. Tools like reminding myself that it was nothing new. Assholes like him were always dropping unintentional microaggressions. It had been something I'd grown used to, and given my probation, wasn't a battle worth fighting.

"Yes sir." I replied through my teeth, as I begrudgingly swallowed my pride.

"Now, why don't you spend today practicing. Our first residents don't move in until tomorrow."

—

In just a matter of a week or so, as the doors of "The Cornelius" opened to its new tenants, I learned pretty much everything I needed to know about the job.

Said tenants were rich. Very rich. And most of them acted as such. Entitled. Obnoxious. Holier than thou. Especially given my own social class. But a few of them weren't so bad, and tipped well.

Mr. Winfred's assistant, Jane, was a  lovely human being. Patient, kind, thoughtful, understanding. Especially when compared to both the building's uptight residents, and Mr. Winfred himself. It had been years since I had dated, and the very thought of meeting a partner stressed me out to no end, but if I was to find someone, I hoped she'd be like Jane.

The elevator didn't open on the basement level. As I'd learned countless times, it was possible to go there, but the doors simply wouldn't open.

The old freight itself was finicky as fuck. Stop the lever one second too early, or one second too late, and when the doors open, you're halfway between a floor. But eventually, I got used to it, to the point where most of the building's tenants assumed the role of freight operator had always been my job. And when you're good at your service job, and do it with a smile on your face, the tips start flowing.

And so, all was well for the first couple weeks on the job...

...A seemingly refreshing return to normalcy, after ten long years...

...Until...

...The disappearances started happening.

—

I was just arriving to work one day, when I heard about the first disappearance.

"Have you seen - I mean, have you been in contact with Elizabeth Davis? From room 401?" Mr. Winfred asked, after correcting himself. Something he did often, which continued to annoy me.

"Um." I replied, unsure of where he was going with the question. "Not since yesterday. She got back from work, and I brought her up to the fourth floor. But come to think of it, I don't think she rode the elevator down this morning. Like she usually does."

"Interesting." My boss replied, before continuing. "She disappeared yesterday."

"Disappeared?" I asked.

"Yeah, husband said she never came home last night."

"Hmm. Well I know for certain that I brought her to the fourth floor. Did you check the hallway surveillance footage?"

"Not yet. Unfortunately the building inspector's in today, and I won't have time until tomorrow. Let's hope she just went somewhere, or got lost. In the meantime, keep an eye out - I mean - just, let me know if you hear of anything suspicious."

"Yes sir," I replied, once again resisting the urge to snap on him, before heading for the elevator, where I started the day's shift.

SLAM!

SCREEEECH!

That day, I did my best to do as Mr. Winfred had asked, and listened carefully for any signs of mischief.

But the day went on, business as usual and by the end of the day, I hadn't noticed anything out of the ordinary...

...Except... The only thing of note was a difference in Mr. Lawrence's demeanor. The tenant of room 805, he was a salesman, and acted like one. When I say the man could talk, the man could talk. To a point where whenever he was a passenger in the old freight elevator, despite the long ride from floor one to floor eight, I'd rarely have a chance to get a word in.

But this time... was different. This time, Mr. Lawrence entered the elevator chatting away, just as he always did. But about halfway up, he just... stopped talking. And the thing about my job is, if someone chooses to talk or not talk, it's their decision, and none of my business. So I left him alone, and when we reached the eighth floor, I simply said goodnight. To which, he didn't reply.

*Must be going through something.* I thought to myself, having been unable to truly get a sense of his composure, without being able to see him, before closing the double doors and heading off to help the next passenger.

SLAM!

SCREEEECH!

—

Later that night, Mr. Winfred called me into his office, and asked me to take a seat beside his assistant, Jane.

"Mr. Owens. Are you aware of the situation that's going on in the building?" He asked, in an interrogating tone.

"Um... yes, you told me about it yesterday. The disappearance, sir." I replied.

"Disappearances now. Plural." He said sternly.

"But... who else?" I asked.

"Mr. Lawrence."

"What happened to him?"

"Well, to be honest, I was hoping you could tell me. Cause much like Ms.Davis, the last place he was seen was going into your elevator."

"What about the cameras in the hallways?"

"I'm afraid that after reviewing the tapes, after stepping into your elevator, neither Ms. Davis, or Mr Lawrence, ever stepped out."

"But that's... not... possible."

"Mr. Owens. I'm going to give you an opportunity. Is there anything you want to tell me? I know you have a sordid past."

"Mr. Winfred!" Jane interjected, clearly offended by his words, and implications.

"Quiet, Jane." He scolded, before continuing. "Answer the question, Mr. Owens."

I didn't know what to say. I was so shocked, so flustered, by what he was implying, that I simply froze.

"Mr. Owens!" He screamed.

"I... I... don't know!" I cried out, as I heard Jane squirm in her seat. "I'm telling you, the last time I heard from either of them, I took them up to their floors. But I'm-"

"You're what! Blind?"

"Well, yes sir. I don't see what goes on inside the elevator. I just let them on and off."

"Mr. Owens. If they got on your elevator, and never got off, where could they possibly have gone?"

"I... don't... know." I replied, at this point, wanting to grab him by force, demand that he never speak to me that way again, and scream out my innocence. But my next parole appointment was the following week, so once again, all I could do was just bite my tongue.

Mr. Winfred paused for a moment, took a deep breath, and regained his composure.

"Mr. Owens, I could go to the police now. And that would be very bad for someone like you."

*Fuck. He's right.* I thought to myself, realizing, that if he went to the police, and I was even remotely suspected of what was going on in the building, it was back to prison for me.

"But lucky for you," He continued, "There are things going on in the building that I wouldn't want to bring unwanted attention to. And for that reason, I have decided not to go to the police... yet. But consider this a warning. And know, that I have a repairman coming first thing tomorrow morning to install a security camera inside the freight elevator, so I can see what exactly it is that you're doing in there."

I had know idea how to react to Mr. Winfred's continued accusations. So I simply remained silent.

"Now get out of here and go home! We'll reconvene on this tomorrow." He said dismissively, before Jane walked me out of the room, down the hall, and outside the building, where I planned to return home for the night.

—

Fifteen minutes later, we were at a bar down the street, where Jane apparently frequented.

"But where could they possibly have gone?" I asked her, my hands trembling at both the thought of people disappearing in the elevator, and that it was happening under my watch.

"Thing is," Jane said, as she finished her beer. "There's something you should know about the building."

""The Cornelius"?"

"No, from before it was called that. It used to be a factory of some kind."

"Is that what Mr. Winfred was talking about when he said that there were things going on in the building? That he didn't want to bring unwanted attention to?"

"Well, yes and no. Yes, in a sense, that Mr. Winfred cut some corners, and rather than fully renovate the entire warehouse, he simply walled off entire sections of the old structure. Like the basement."

"And no?"

"No, in a sense, that even Mr. Winfred doesn't know what's really going on in the elevator. Sure, it'd be easy to pin it on you, especially with your criminal record - no offense... but even he knows that it's probably something... else."

"Something else?"

"See, that's where things get hazy. Because no one knows what exactly went on at the factory, before it became "The Cornelius." But rumors have it... it was laboratory of some kind, and some fucked up shit went on inside there."

"Like what?"

"That, my friend. I don't know. But what I do know is... I better be getting to bed."

"Fair enough. Well, thanks for the drink, and the support." I said with a smile, as we made our way out of the bar. 

"Yeah, don't let Mr. Winfred get to you. And try not to worry too much."

—

Contrary to Jane's suggestion, that night I worried... a lot. About the disappearances, what might be causing them, whatever may have gone on in the factory, and most importantly, about everything getting pinned on me.

I couldn't fall asleep, tossing and turning in bed as my mind raced. And each time I finally passed out, I'd wake up in a panic attack, my heart pounding, short of breath and in a cold sweat.

But it didn't stop there. The uncomfortable feeling of terror and fear, accompanied by the vibrating sensation of adrenaline pumping through my body, remained well into the next morning, when I stepped back into the elevator, terrified by what might be going on inside there.

*Please don't leave me alone in this fucking thing.* I thought to myself.

And within a matter of minutes, my prayers were answered.

"How goes it?" The surveillance installation worker called out, his cheery disposition contrary to mine.

"Um... not too bad." I replied, lying through my teeth, as he stepped inside.

But after a minute or two of sharing the elevator with him, my fears lessened and my body relaxed, comforted by the positive conversation, and the metallic, clinking sounds of the installation.

*Everything's okay. The doors are open. And he's talking.* I thought to myself.

But eventually, the man finished installing the camera, and began wrapping up the job.

"Well, that's it! Camera's all installed and running now." He called out. "Let's just take the elevator for a spin and make sure we don't lose the signal."

"Yes, of course." I replied, before reaching for the double doors...

SLAM!

SCREEEECH!

..And moving the lever up. 

We started moving.

"Fascinating job, I must say, elevator operator. But I suppose you could say the same for mine."

"Pays the bills." I replied, feigning a chuckle.

*If he's here, and he's talking, then I'm safe.* I continued to reassure myself.

But a few minutes into our ascent, just like Mr. Lawrence... the man... suddenly stopped talking.

"Alright, looks like it's working fine. We can head back down and-"

SILENCE.

"Hello?" I asked.

But he didn't respond.

*Fuck.* I thought to myself, realizing that whatever caused Ms. Davis, and Mr. Lawrence, and seemingly now the repairman to disappear, could still be in the elevator with me.

Standing there, shaking, sweat rolling down my brow, I backed myself into the corner of the elevator, as I reached for the lever, pressed it down, and the elevator began to make its descent back to the ground floor.

When I finally reached the lobby...

DING!

I scrambled to open the doors...

SLAM!

SCREEEECH!

...And darted out, gasping for air, expecting to find a safe haven.

But instead, all I heard was the sound of Mr. Winfred's voice. "Where is the repairman?"

—

A few minutes later, I was once again sitting in Mr. Winfred's office, next to Jane, this time attempting to explain what had happened.

"...And then he stopped talking! Just like Mr. Lawrence."

"You know what, Mr. Owens. I'm tired of your excuses. And now that we have a working camera in the elevator, it's time to find out what's really going on inside there." He threatened, as I heard him clicking away on his computer, clearly reviewing the footage.

"Please do!" I cried out, "I'm telling you, it's not me."

That's when... Mr. Winfred, and Jane, both went silent.

"Hello?" I called out, unable to see what was really going on. Given the fact that my passengers had recently been going silent, the thought crossed my mind that they too had disappeared, but I could still hear their breathing in the room. Breathing, that sounded like it was increasing rapidly...

...Until they broke the silence.

"Oh... my..." Jane said, struggling to catch her breath.

"That can't be. Let me rewind the tape." Mr. Winfred mumbled, the most scared I had ever heard him.

"What is it?" I asked, as they seemingly played back the video.

I would later find out from Jane that the footage would show myself and the repairman in the elevator, as a slithering, grotesque, humanoid figure, suddenly climbed down from the roof of the elevator, wrapped it's slimy arms around the repairman, then somehow hopped back out of the elevator, and pulled the man up with it. Leaving me standing there, completely unaware of what had just happened.

But in that moment, Mr. Winfred must have realized the... complications associated with reporting such a bizarre phenomenon, and instead decided to finally pin it on me.

"Mr. Owens, you shouldn't have done that!" He cried out.

"Mr. Winfred, what are you talking about?" Jane asked, "You and I just watched the same footage."

That's when I heard him drag a file to his computer's trash and delete it.

CRUNCH.

"Stay out of this, Jane. This man has killed three people in the elevator. I knew I shouldn't have hired an ex con!"

"But sir, I didn't-" I tried to reply, before he interrupted.

"Mr. Owens, I'm picking up the phone, and calling the police. I'd suggest you just stay put."

"But Mr. Winfred, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything!"

"Yes, is this 911? I'm the manager of "The Cornelius" and I'd like to report three murders in my building."

"We'd better go." I heard Jane say, as I felt her place her hand on my shoulder.

"And yes, I have reason to believe the killer is our elevator operator, an ex convict, who is sitting right in front of me."

"Come on, let's go!" Jane screamed, as she tugged at my shirt, I hopped up from my seat, and she led me out of the office, down the hall, and into... of all places... the old freight elevator, as she explained to me what she had seen on the surveillance tape.

—

SLAM!

SCREEEECH!

"Take us to the basement!" Jane called out.

"But the basement is walled off." I replied.

"Just do it!" She insisted, before I moved the lever down and the elevator began to move.

I spent the ride catching my breath, until we finally reached the basement level.

DING!

"Now what?" I asked.

But Jane didn't reply.

"Jane?"

*Oh fuck.* I thought to myself. *The monster.*

That's when I turned to the center of the freight elevator, where Jane had been standing, reached out into the unknown...

...And sure enough, felt the cold, slimy, skin of the creature, wrapped around Jane's face, preventing her from making a sound.

Not knowing what else to do, I gripped its disgusting appendages with both hands, and slowly pried it off Jane, as she let out a...

...SCREAM..

...And the monster's arm quickly slithered away, back up through the roof of the freight.

Jane dropped to the ground, coughing violently.

"You okay?" I asked her.

But rather than responding, she simply handed me something...

....I opened my fist, to find a pair of keys.

"The lock above the lever. Unlock it." She instructed, still coughing, as I felt around the lever, found the lock, inserted the key, and unlocked it.

CLICK.

"The doors. They should open now." Jane said, as she stood up, having finally caught her breath.

SCREEEECH!

SLAM!

—

We arrived in the dark basement to smell the same, musty odor from the freight elevator.

After her eyes adjusted and she scanned our surroundings, Jane informed me that this floor looked nothing like the other eight, newly renovated floors, with their modern feel and minimalistic designs.

Instead, the basement was a window into the building's former self, when it had been a factory. Its walls brick and crumbling, its floors concrete and cracked.

And scattered everywhere, were the dusty remnants of laboratory equipment. Devices, machines, tanks, most of which were destroyed, or disconnected, or both.

"What went on down here?" I asked.

"From the looks of it, something inhumane," Jane said, after she picked up a few tattered pieces of paper from one of the lab stations, and told me what was on it.

"The first page looks like some sort of a diagram, of a man being pumped with chemicals from tanks. And the second, a drawing... of the creature from the elevator. In pencil beside it, someone appears to have labeled it "The Silencer.""

*Silencer.* I thought to myself, before remembering that the creature seemed to always silence the sounds of its victims, and to have been repulsed by Jane's scream. At the same time, it had never bothered me in the elevator, as I tended to stand there in silence.

But before I could dwell too much on the thought, Jane interrupted.

"If you don't mind my asking. What did you go to prison for in the first place?" She asked.

"It's okay," I said, surprised she had waited this long to ask, before contemplating the best way to explain what had happened. "’Cause of my temper. Some guy was being a dick on the train platform. We got into a scuffle, and he accidentally fell into the tracks."

"Over what? Did he insult you? Your blindness?"

"No, I'm afraid not." I replied, "We were drunk... and arguing over... a basketball game, of all things. He was... my friend."

"Oh my God. I'm so sorry."

"It's okay."

Jane put her hand on my shoulder, and we stood there in silence for a moment...

...Until suddenly, we heard the sound of Mr. Winfred, and the police approaching, as they ran down what must have been a hidden set of stairs from the ground level to the basement.

"Come on, follow me!" Jane called out, as she took me by the hand and led me into what I'd soon discover was a labyrinthian network of old passages, while the police and Mr. Winfred both called out to us.

"This is the police! Put your hands on your head, and turn yourself in!"

"You're trapped, Mr. Owens! Just confess your crimes, and you'll simply go back to jail!"

We continued to run deeper and deeper into the passages, as our pursuers began to close in on us, their footsteps getting closer... and closer... and closer...

...Until suddenly, the sound of their footsteps was replaced by that of...

...SCREAMING...

...And they suddenly went...

...SILENT.

"What the?" Jane whispered.

"The creature." I whispered. "It must be down here."

That's when we hatched a plan.

—

Having found our way out of the labyrinth and back to the entrance of the laboratory, where we had arrived in the old freight elevator, I found myself standing alone, waiting, as I nervously tapped my cane on the basement floor, Jane having gone off on her own.

That's when I heard Mr. Winfred emerge from the passages, alone, and call out to me.

"Mr. Owens! There's nowhere to run! Even your beloved elevator is gone. You're cornered." He taunted, as I backed towards the elevator and tapped at it with my cane, its doors open, its shaft empty.

"What did you say?" I asked, encouraging him to talk louder.

"What are you, deaf now too?" The ignorant old man snapped back. "I said, you have nowhere to run!"

"I'm sorry, you'll have to forgive me," I said sarcastically, pointing to my ears. "Can you repeat that again?"

That's when Mr. Winfred began approaching and screamed, "You worthless, ex con! I knew I shouldn't have hired you in the first place! And now, you'll go back to where you belong!"

But suddenly...

...Mr. Winfred went SILENT...

...As the creature must have wrapped its slimy tentacles around his face.

That's when I seized the opportunity, ran over to Mr. Winfred, gripped the cold body of the creature, which was indeed wrapped around him, turned, and flung them both behind me, into the hollow elevator shaft...

SLAM!

...Before hitting the "Up" button on the wall, and calling the freight elevator down.

Suddenly, the gears of the elevator above could be heard turning away, and the machine began its quick descent down.

"Mr. Owens, no!" Mr. Winfred cried out, clearly now separated from the creature.

I froze for a moment, as my mind raced back to the night of the tragic accident, when my friend called out to me from the train tracks, and I was unable to save him in time...

....Until I eventually snapped myself out of it, and willed myself to save Mr. Winfred, no matter how evil the asshole's intentions may have been, reaching out my hand out, and pulling him up and out of the elevator, just as the freight car came crash down to the basement level.

SLAM!

CRUNCH!

"RAAAAAAAARRRRR!" The slimy beast cried out, as it was crushed under the old elevator's weight.

DING!

The basement fell SILENT for a moment, until...

SCREEEECH!

SLAM!

...Jane stepped out and said, "Going up?"

But the joke was met was silence. I simply stood there, shaking, as Mr. Winfred did the same, clearly shocked by the events that had just occurred.

—

A few weeks later, after the authorities had done a full sweep of the basement, and cleared out all traces of the building's old laboratory, I found myself once again back in the manager's office.

"Mr. Owens. This is the last time I'm gonna tell you this!" Jane joked, as I heard her recline back in what was once Mr. Winfred's chair, having been named interim manager since her boss's recent and... ironic... prison sentencing.

"Who's the convict now?" I said with a smile, before making my way out of the office.

"Wait." Jane said, stopping me at the door. "You sure you want to go back to operating the elevator? After all that's happened? Like I said, the doorman job is yours if you want it."

"What's the worst that could happen?" I replied with a smile. "There's another one of those creatures in the building somewhere?"
