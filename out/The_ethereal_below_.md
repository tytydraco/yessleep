I’ve always been drawn to caves. It’s an odd obsession, I know, but something about the darkness, the ancient rock, the sense of being underground, where the world is distant and muted, has always felt like an escape. I’ve explored more than my fair share—abandoned mines, forgotten tunnels, hidden caverns in the hills of the Appalachians. But nothing could have prepared me for the last one.

It started out innocently enough, a weekend trip with a few friends—Ben, Mia, and Leo. We had all been looking for something new to explore, and when Leo found a mention of a cave system in an old, barely-used guidebook, we were intrigued. The entrance was supposed to be at the foot of a remote mountain, the sort of place where only locals knew to go. The book mentioned it briefly, claiming it was a “forgotten” cave, untouched for decades. The sort of place people warned you about, but never gave specifics as to why.

We weren’t cave experts, but we had the right gear—helmets, flashlights, ropes, and harnesses—and, most importantly, we had the confidence of youth. The warnings we heard from locals only fueled our curiosity. They mentioned “strange noises” and “bad feelings,” but that was enough to convince us that this cave would be something worth exploring.

The hike to the cave was easy, the terrain manageable. The air was thick with the scent of pine and damp earth. The entrance was barely noticeable—just a small gap between the rocks, like the mouth of some ancient beast waiting to swallow us whole. But we were undeterred.

The first few hours inside were like any cave exploration—narrow, twisting tunnels that eventually opened into wide chambers. The walls were slick with moisture, and the air was cool and stale, but nothing unusual. We laughed and joked, snapping photos and mapping out our path as we went deeper. Ben, always the adventurous one, led the way, and Mia, the quietest of us, followed closely behind.

Then we found it.

We had just entered a long, narrow passage when we noticed something strange. The air had grown cooler, and the walls were more jagged, almost unnaturally so. The passage seemed to be pulling us forward. There was an odd, pervasive feeling of pressure, like something was waiting, watching us.

I noticed it first—the scratching sound. It was soft at first, distant, like the sound of claws on stone, but it wasn’t quite rhythmic. It wasn’t right.

“Do you hear that?” I asked, my voice low.

Ben, with his usual bravado, waved it off. “It’s probably just the wind. This place is full of weird echoes.” But even as he said it, I could see the unease in his eyes.

We kept going.

The scratching grew louder the further we moved, as though it were following us, the sound coming from deep within the rock. There was no wind down here, no breeze to cause such a noise. Leo looked over his shoulder, his face pale, but he said nothing. Mia had gone silent, her usual chatter replaced by a nervous energy I could feel from a distance.

And then we saw it. A massive stone slab, leaning against the back wall of the cavern, almost perfectly smooth—too smooth for a cave. It didn’t belong. At first, I thought it was just part of the natural rock formation, but the more I looked at it, the more it seemed out of place. The way it gleamed in the dim light of our flashlights was unnatural.

There were carvings on it—symbols I couldn’t make sense of, like ancient script, though I had no frame of reference for what it could mean. The closer we got, the more I felt drawn to it. A strange, almost magnetic pull.

“Ben, don’t touch it,” Mia said, her voice barely a whisper. But Ben, ever the curious one, was already moving forward, his hand hovering over the smooth stone surface.

I remember thinking—just for a second—that something didn’t feel right. But it was too late.

As soon as Ben’s fingers made contact with the stone, the slab shifted. Not slowly, but with a sudden, terrifying lurch, as though something within it had awakened. The cavern groaned under the movement, the air thick with a sudden, oppressive heat. A crack split down the middle of the slab, and from that crack came a sound—the wet, slithering scrape of something far too large to be human.

I don’t know how to explain what happened next. I wish I could say it was a blur, but it wasn’t. It was real, each second seared into my memory, crystal clear. The slab slid open, revealing what lay beneath it.

It wasn’t a treasure. It wasn’t an ancient artifact. It was something far worse. Something that made no sense—something that shouldn’t exist in this world.

A mass of flesh, pale and slick, twisted in on itself. It was like looking at something that had been submerged in the deepest, darkest part of the ocean for centuries. Its limbs were long, too long, ending in hands with claws that looked far more like the appendages of an insect than a human. The skin was translucent in places, showing sinew and muscle beneath, and its eyes—if you could call them that—were deep, hollow pits, like black voids staring right into your soul.

Ben screamed. A high, terrified sound that echoed through the cave. It wasn’t a scream of a man; it was the scream of an animal, a primal terror so raw and gut-wrenching it made my stomach twist. He stumbled back, his body jerking uncontrollably, as though the thing inside the stone had already begun to crawl into his mind.

But it wasn’t Ben that it wanted.

The creature—it—lunged at us, a blur of unnatural speed, its claws scraping across the stone floor as it moved. I can still hear that noise in my head—the skittering, scraping sound as it charged toward us.

Mia was the first to break. She turned and ran, her footsteps echoing off the stone, the air thick with the scent of something rotten. Leo followed, but in the chaos, I didn’t see where he went. I only saw the creature, its eyes locking onto mine as it scrambled toward me, its mouth opening wide—too wide—showing rows of sharp, uneven teeth, glistening with saliva.

I don’t remember how I escaped. All I know is that I ran. The walls of the cave seemed to close in around me, the air growing thick and suffocating, and the sound of the thing behind me—its claws on the stone, its screeching cries—grew louder and louder.

I don’t know how I made it back to the entrance. The others were gone. I was alone when I emerged from that cave, gasping for air, my body covered in sweat and dirt. I was shaking uncontrollably. The cave’s mouth swallowed me up behind me, as though the earth itself had sealed shut.

The police found me hours later, delirious, wandering in a daze through the woods, barely able to speak. They searched the cave, of course. But when they went in, they found nothing. No creature. No stone slab. No carvings. Just the same winding tunnels we had walked through earlier, and a strange sense of emptiness, like the cave itself was waiting.

I’m the only one who made it out. And I can’t help but wonder if I was meant to.

The nightmares came soon after. I can’t escape them. Every night, I close my eyes, and I hear it—scratching. Soft at first, but always getting closer. It’s there, in the walls. In the earth beneath me. Waiting. Watching.

It’s still down there. And one day, I think, it’s going to find a way out.
