I'm just gonna get straight into it.  I'm not sure if this post will be as interesting or "scary" as the others, but I just thought I would post about this anyways, because I want to and maybe even want some advice on what I should think of the situation (specifically if I should assume if my house is haunted or not).

When I was about 9 or 10 years old, I had a friend over for a sleepover.  We were bored after watching YouTube for, like, three hours, so we both agreed to play hide and seek around the house - we decided to play downstairs, since my parents had express that they didn't want us upstairs because they were wrapping Christmas presents for me and the rest of the family.  There was one round of hide and seek where my friend was the seeker, and, of course, as you can guess, I had to hide.  There's a small, maybe 4x3 bathroom that's right across from the front door - I saw that as a good place to hide (which, by the way, it very much *wasn't*, my house doesn't have much hiding spots lol).  I closed the bathroom door, kept the lights off, and pressed my back against one of the walls - I was there for about 15-20 seconds before I felt something against my back, something that felt like two human hands, and suddenly, I felt as if I was pushed forward - luckily, I didn't fall, though I did stumble quite a bit.  I was immediately freaked out, being my 9 to 10-year-old self, and ran out of the bathroom - I was anxious for the rest of the night, and my eyes were darting around the room, scared to see something or perhaps again feel something that wasn't (or maybe was) there.

I've also experienced my bedroom door opening by itself *multiple* different times - and throughout all the times it happened, I was 100% sure that, not only my door was completely and properly closed, but *locked*.  I also recall rarely hearing faint whispers around me, most of them saying my name - whether I was hallucinating, going crazy, or experiencing a real paranormal experience, I was freaked out, though I always tried to ignore it the best I could.

I also recall being home alone, when I was around 12 years old, my parents at the grocery store and my older brother either hanging out with his friends or at work (I can't remember), I heard laughing downstairs in the living room - not faint like the whispers I had heard, but *very* audible and noticeable - it sounded like my stepdad's laugh, who, again, was at the grocery store with my mom when I heard it.  I even called him and asked him if he had perhaps left the TV on, though he confirmed that he never left it on, nor had it even been turned on that day.

Luckily, I haven't experienced any of these anomalies in quite a minute, though they still freak me out just a bit.  Even if no one's interested in this, I just wanted to say something anyways, just to feel slightly more at ease - also, I apologize for my horrible story-telling.
