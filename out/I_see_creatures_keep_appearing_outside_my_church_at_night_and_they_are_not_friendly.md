A little backstory: I was an orphan since birth and I do not know my parents but what I was told by Fr. Gregory is that a young woman gave me to one of the older nuns named Sis. Lucia, my mother never came back to get me and so Fr. Gregory took me in and raised me in the convent and I can say that he is my father because he's the one who took care of me and paid for my food and education, it's pretty sad to not know your parents but having someone like Fr. Gregory who's a model priest raise you is more than I can ask for and so I grew up in the church in servitude to God and the church.

I am now 18 but I still serve in the parish as an altar server on Sundays as it is my responsibility and the church itself is a big one so every Sunday it's crowded and many people come to worship God and receive Communion, it's a simple job but I appreciate it greatly and I love serving in the church as an altar server but everything changed until last night when I saw things that I cannot explain so here's how my story goes.

I was at my room looking down from my window that's facing the main street pondering about random stuff and thinking about how I'm gonna wake up early when I am unable to sleep, as I look and ponder about random stuff the street was very silent and only the street lights illuminate the empty street, it gives a different feeling to me, different from when it's daytime when the streets are packed with vehicles and people but now it's but silent and empty

I stare into it until I saw a few movements on the corner of the street and running out from the shadows is an old man in his 50s running away from something or someone and he is obviously in the state of panic judging by his face, I froze as I watch him desperately run but soon I saw a figure in the shadows running fast and a bit odd as he's running on all fours but his movements are fast and soon he came into the light

But it's not a man, something that resembles a man but far more hideous. It caught up with the old man and grabbed one of his legs, he then proceeds to pounce on the old man now screaming for help but no one is there to answer him, not even me for I am frozen in fear as I watch that deformed man attack and rip off the old man in the streets, I just watched from my window, shaking and scared of what is happening outside

The deformed man started to rip off the organs of the old man and began feasting on it, it ate his intestines and liver, it then proceeded to munch on the flesh while giggling as it consumes the flesh of the now deceased old man, I am shocked and terrified of what I am seeing and it it gets even worse

The deformed man began laughing while it eats the flesh of the poor old man and is releasing its excrement uncontrollably and after releasing the excrement from it's body, it consumed the excrement again and uncontrollably eats the old man's organs like a deranged animal

I am frozen in place as I watch it indulge in it's own activity and unbeknownst to me is that Fr. Gregory woke up from his bed and was watching it as well, he tapped my shoulder and I looked back at who is tapping my shoulder and I was almost startled that it was Fr. Gregory

I asked him if he saw it all and he answered yes, he then closed the window and curtains so we can avoid watching it, he then talked to me about what I saw and told me to relax from my servitude for a while because of what we saw

Currently I am resting and I will post an update after this night
