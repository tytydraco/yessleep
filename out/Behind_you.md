I have only been driving for a year.

I have never had to replace a broken part in my car, I have never even had my car break down. I've only ever changed my wiper fluid and filled my car up with gas.

I mean, tonight was like any other night, was doing my regular routine of going to the gym, stopping at a gas station to grab a protein shake, and heading home to play video games.

I take this dark, rural road to get home from the gym. Aside from one intersection with a flashing red light and the odd house, the road is bleak and empty.

I was on my way home listening to music when my car died. It was instant. Everything went dark.

I was confused, I thought that my engine would at least start to sputter before my car died. I ended up calling my brother to let him know that I needed a jump, and that he'd be here in 10 minutes.

I decided, out of fear of animals, that I would lock myself in my car and distract myself on my phone until my brother arrived.

I looked around at the darkness surrounding me, it was creepy. It was like I was in a tub of black paint, not a speck of light in sight...

Not long after starting to watch a video on my phone, I heard a light tapping sound coming from my roof.

*Tap...Tap...Tap*

Now, I thought it could be some sort of tree branch tapping my car, as I was right beside the entrance to a forest with overhanging trees, but that is when I realized the tapping was more methodical.

*Tap...Tap...Tap \*pause\* Tap...Tap...Tap \*pause\**

I wondered if maybe an animal had gotten onto my roof, and decided to turn on my phones flashlight and open my door to check my roof, and sure enough it was empty. What made me feel uneasy, though, was that none of the trees near my car could reach the roof of it.

I sat back into my car when I decided to call my brother to see where he was.

"*I'm five minutes away man, stop calling me"*

I hung up and opened Instagram and started scrolling.

As time went on I realized it had been thirty minutes since I had called him. I decided to call him again, and I got the same answer.

"*I'm five minutes away man, stop calling me"*

Before I could even ask anything else, he had hung up. This couldn't be possible. It was 10 minutes from my house to this location and he'd been driving for nearly 45 minutes. My brother is normally lazy but he wouldn't lie about having left the house when I'm in a situation like this...

That's when I heard it again...

*Tap...Tap...Tap*

This time it sounded like it was on the window, and so I scanned the windows and saw nothing, that was until I checked the rearview mirror. A dark figure filled the glass, and shining my phones flashlight on it revealed its horrible features.

Pale skin, milky white eyes devoid of any colour, boasting an ear to ear smile.

I let out a scream and that's when it disappeared from my back windshield.

I called my brother a third time and yelled:

"WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU?"

"*I'm five minutes away man, stop calling me"*

And the phone hung up. I realized that the expression was the same each time. I decided to call back again but this time look at my phone, and to my surprise when I clicked *call* under my brothers contact name and that's when I realized what my phone said:

*Call Failed.*

And I heard it

*"I'm five minutes away man, stop calling me"*

I realized though, it wasn't coming from my phone, but I was actually hearing it in my ear. I slowly turned around and that's when I saw it, this... this thing behind me, staring me in the eyes with a blood curdling smile. He then repeated it in my brothers voice:

*"I'm here."*

I gripped the door handle and shoved it open, falling into the road. It was just then when the darkness disappeared and was taken over by light. I looked towards the light source and saw my brothers car pulling up behind mine.

I could hear my heart beat thumping in my ears as my vision came in and out, a vignette surrounding what I could see.

"What the fuck are you doing?" He said, getting out of his car laughing.

"WHA- what?" I screamed, looking into my backseat, it was empty.

"Whats wrong?" My brother asked, more serious now.

"The- there was someone in my back seat" I said, panicking.

My brother retreated to his car and grabbed his gun from his glovebox.

I checked my phone and to my dismay, it was only 10 minutes after I called him, and there was only one call in my call history.

Just at that time, my brothers car turned off, the *darkness coming back*.

"What the fuck?" I heard him say.

He flashed his phone flashlight on my back windshield. 

A smiling face drawn crudely in a thick red substance, I could assume was blood, and small writing underneath reading:

'Behind you.'
