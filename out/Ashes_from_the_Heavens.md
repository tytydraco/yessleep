The atmosphere thickens as flakes of ash descend from clouded skies. Structures and all that encompass the Earth become caked in a heavy white soot.

Observers speculate, many attempting to decipher this puzzling phenomenon, but those who are wiser know that this can only mean one thing.

Children line the streets, unknowingly inhaling the toxic air that was once clean and pure. People of all ages halt their busy, yet meaningless lives to bear witness to the grand spectacle that is the burning of Heaven itself.

One little girl stands alone in an empty roundabout. She stiffly clutches her stuffed animal closely to her chest, staring at a spot in the clouds. A few steps away, her parents pace frantically within their domicile, too enthralled in their own problems to pay attention to their curious daughter. 

They desperately yearn to regain some semblance of control over their lives, but they can only pray for the strength to face the opaque abyss that lay ahead.

Unfortunately for them, their prayers fall on deaf ears, as a colossal object lands directly within the center of the roundabout, striking the asphalt with tremendous force. It is the head of an angel: The Archangel, Michael.

A weathered, aged man overlooks a scenic landscape from a balcony atop the tallest tower, at the highest point of the world. Over the course of many years, his lungs have come to acclimate to the thin mountain air. He has completed many impressive feats throughout his life, with this one only being a small fraction of everything he has accomplished.

Embers begin to trickle down from the cosmos. Before long, the old man is clawing at his own throat, suffocating as he breathes in the white smoke cascading down the tower. With his last breath escaping his lips, he slumps over the edge of the balcony, plummeting from his keep down to the unforgiving ground beneath.

His long and prosperous life has come to an unremarkably abrupt end. His lifeless body is swiftly encased in ash, leaving but a white mound in its place.

Most others will go on to experience similarly tragic fates.

The ashes from above ignite the fires of an already dying world, only to leave it charred and exposed for all its sins to be witnessed by anyone who has not yet succumbed to the flames. Many flail in agony as their fleshes melt away from the insatiable heat. 

The Earth spirals into chaos, and I sit here, looking up. Iâ€™ve always looked up, gazing upon the glory and righteousness of Heaven through eyes of hate and envy.

Now, as I reflect through sorrow and regret, all I see is ash.

I am at a loss for words, for I know not who is responsible for this most unforgivable act. As I sit here, I can feel in all my being that someone has done the unspeakable.

Someone has burned down the Heavens.

Someone has killed God.

And now, I am left here to suffer alone.
