When I was a junior in high school, I had a nightmare. I’ve never really had bad nightmares, but this one was an exception. It happened almost four years ago, yet I still think about it from time to time. I remember waking up from it, too afraid to go back to sleep. So, I turned on the light, wrote down what I had dreamt, and waited for morning to come.

I’ve only ever told a couple of people about this nightmare, but I thought this might be a good place to share it. I’ve edited what I wrote slightly to make it clearer, but I’ve kept it mostly the same as when I first wrote it that night. I hope you like it.





I had a bad nightmare.

The first thing I remember is "waking up" in the darkness of my small room and seeing my closet door wide open. I almost never leave it open, especially not when I go to bed, so this already felt wrong. I got out of bed and shut the closet door, then made my way downstairs.

My family’s house is set up with a living room connected to a kitchen. There are two couches in the living room and a half-wall separating it from the kitchen. I walked to the bottom of the stairs and sat down on the couch with its back to the half-wall. It sounded like my whole family was downstairs. My brother and dad seemed to be in the kitchen behind me, and my mom was lying on the other couch across from me.

I couldn’t take my eyes off my mom.

Something felt off about her. She was acting strange, like someone trying to imitate my mom but not quite getting it right. The family was chatting and making jokes. I joined in, trying to ignore the gnawing feeling in my chest. I made a joke myself, and I guess "Mom" really liked it. She threw her head back and laughed—but her face changed.

Her mouth stretched wider than any human’s should. Her eyes and teeth pushed themselves out of place. Her skin twisted and stretched as her form grew more grotesque with every passing second. Instinctively, I screamed and threw the pillow I was holding at her.

My dad and brother didn’t seem to notice the horrifying creature that was pretending to be my mother. I looked away for a second, desperate to get their attention, and when I turned back, she was normal again. She was just lying there on the couch, smiling at me.

I stared at her in silence, frozen in fear and confusion.

Then, another figure walked across the living room, heading toward the doorway between the kitchen and the living room. "My mom" got up and started following close behind, her eyes wild with a crazed intensity. For some reason, I was sure that this new person was my real mom.

Dread filled me as I saw the monster getting close to the new person. I stood up from the couch. In the split second it took me to get up, the monster had collapsed to the floor at the feet of the new person.

I crept slowly toward the doorway. Both figures stood completely still. As I drew closer, I said, timidly, “Hey, Mom?”

The moment the words left my mouth, both figures snapped their heads toward me, and in perfect unison, they answered, “Yes?”

The new figure looked exactly like my mom. The monster had twisted back into its terrifying, deformed version from before, but both of them were smiling at me.

I glanced down at the monster on the floor. Despite its horrifying appearance, there was unmistakable fear in its eyes. I looked back up at the new figure, certain she was my real mom. Fear surged through me, and I yelled desperately, “Kill it! Stomp on it!”

But she just kept smiling. She never blinked, never looked away.

Her smile slowly shifted, from warm and familiar to something cold and dead—something sinister that sent chills down my spine. She began walking toward me, arms outstretched.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the monster on the floor, its fear growing more visible by the second. In that moment, I realized the thing coming toward me was not my mother.

Panic froze me in place. I tried to step back, but my legs gave out and I fell to the floor.

"My mom" kept coming, inching closer, arms reaching for me.

And just before she could grab me…

I woke up.
