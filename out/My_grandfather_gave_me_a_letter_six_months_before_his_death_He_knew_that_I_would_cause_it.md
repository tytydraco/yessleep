Throughout the last few years, I have made numerous attempts to document the events that followed my 17th birthday. I haven’t been very successful: memories elude me like butterflies through my bare hands, and what I do manage to catch dies on its way to the page. As time passes, my recollection has continued to fade, and that scares me. I believe my story deserves to be told, and I think I owe it to myself to tell it before I lose it forever.

When I was 16, my grandfather gave me a letter. This was not necessarily the beginning of my story, but I am starting with it for the simple reason that it has already been written.

Dear Abby,

I’m writing you this letter to say goodbye. I’m not expecting to die before you read it, or anything like that - no need to rush downstairs and call an ambulance.

I just have a feeling, of a sort. Maybe it’s a premonition, or maybe I’m just recognizing a pattern. Whatever it is, I just know that sometime soon - maybe tomorrow, maybe next year - you are going to go off somewhere, and when you do, I will die. No sooner, no later. I’m not saying it will be your fault - I’m not going to die of a broken heart from your absence, if that’s what it sounds like. It will probably be a heart attack, maybe a stroke, it could even be an accident. Again, it won’t be your fault, and you don’t need to stay on my account - I’ve already lived many long, happy years, and I don’t have any business sticking around for much longer.

I am writing you this goodbye as a letter so that you will have it with you when you decide to go. I doubt I’ll be given any warning before you leave, and frankly, I don’t want it. I know you don't like goodbyes, and neither do I. If you come to say goodbye before you go, then once you leave I will die sad and alone, knowing how terrible the ordeal ahead of you will be. Instead, please just take this letter with you. You can read it again on your way, and I’ll be able to die in blissful peace and ignorance.

I wish you would stay. I used to think that if your Grandma Abigail and I loved you enough, it might keep you from that awful place. I know now that it was a futile hope, but I still implore you to stay away from it. You’ve endured more pain than most kids your age, and while I won’t say that this place is worse than what you’ve been through, it carries a different type of suffering - one that is unrelentingly malevolent and sadistic.

I've seen enough signs for me to know there’s probably nothing I can say or do to keep you here, but if you find yourself in a situation where you have a conscious choice to stay or go, please stay. You’re a bright girl with a long and happy life ahead of you, no matter how grim things seem right now.

I figure this is the part where I should gush about my feelings. I’ve never been much for feelings, but I do okay with stories, so I’ll give you one of those instead, and I hope you’ll get what you can out of it.

I think I always suspected what you had ahead of you, but the first time it became real for me was about twelve years ago.

When you were four years old, I would take you to the park in our neighbourhood almost every day. It wasn’t much of a park, but it was what we had, and you seemed to like it well enough. You might have been too young to remember it properly, so I’ll fill in some of the details. At the entrance of the park, there was a nice little playground with gravel surfacing. It had some monkey bars, swings, a slide, and a sandbox. There was a nice bench attached to the frame that held the gravel in, and I would sit there and watch you do your thing. I wish I had been spry enough to join in, but even back then I couldn’t move around very well. A kid ought to have a father who can keep up with them, and I’m sorry that I was all you got.

Behind the playground, there was a field with enough room for kids to play soccer, which they often did. You wanted to join, of course, but the kids there were quite a few years older than you, so instead you’d sit on the swingset and watch them. There was a nice pair of siblings, brother and sister - I think they were twins - who would sometimes kick a ball around with you when a game wasn’t in progress. I met their parents once or twice; they didn’t seem too remarkable, but evidently did a good job. That’s not particularly relevant, but I figure it’s never a bad idea to remind you that a little act of kindness can stick around in someone’s life for a long time.

The soccer field was surrounded by a treed area. It was mostly evergreens. I have it in my head that spruce trees are the ones with the short, dense needles, and pine trees have long, soft needles. If that’s correct, then these were spruce trees. There were a few leafy trees mixed in there as well - ash and aspen, probably, the type you’d expect to see in our city. It was more of a thicket than a forest - it couldn’t have been larger than a city block in total area - so I didn’t think anything of it. There certainly wasn’t enough room for anything to be lurking in it - the thought that it might not be safe didn’t even cross my mind.

When there were other kids around, you’d often run through the woods and play a game called “forest people.” I’m not sure what the game entailed beyond a lot of hollering and waving sticks around, but it seemed like the kind of good-old-fashioned fun that kids these days don’t get enough of, where the only rules are the ones you make up and you don’t need any fancy toys or equipment. I would say “it’s just like when I was a kid” except that wouldn’t really be true.

You used to brag to me that you and “Wormy” had come up with the game, and that all the other kids loved it. That’s all I ever heard about this “Wormy” character - it seemed like he was an imaginary friend of some sort. The idea of imaginary friends has always put me off a little bit - I'm not sure if it’s normal for a parent to worry that their child’s imaginary friend might actually be a real-life child predator, but I sure did. I scoured the trees to make sure there weren’t any signs that someone had camped out there, and I asked around to see if there’d been any vagrants in the area - nothing turned up. I felt a lot better after you showed me that “Wormy” was what you called the worms and caterpillars. You’ve always been a creative kid, and I hope you never lose that.

One day, you and I went out to the park with a bucket of sidewalk chalk that your grandma had just bought for you. There was a coupon for chalk in the supermarket flyer, and she had a bad habit of buying just about anything when there was a good deal on it. You were so excited about the chalk, though, that it seemed to be worth it.

You started out by drawing on the sidewalk next to the park, but then a couple of kids your age showed up, and you all ran off to play “forest people,” taking the chalk with you. I don’t know if you still remember that day, or if it left an impression on you, but I just want to say that I’m sorry for the way I acted. If you don’t remember, you and your friends came back out of the trees with your faces covered in tree sap and coloured in with white chalk, sporting big grins. I immediately picked you up, with strength I didn’t know I still had, and hauled you home. I made you scrub your face until all the gunk was gone - it must have taken an hour - and threw out your sidewalk chalk. I don’t think I spoke a word the whole time.

You were just a kid - a perfect, precious kid - and I should not have made you suffer for my issues. You couldn’t have known how viscerally horrifying it was for me to see you with your face painted like that. I should have let you know how I was feeling - I wasn’t mad at you, I was terrified for you. At the time, the fear seemed irrational, so I was embarrassed about it, and that kept me from telling you how I felt. That night, I laid awake and cried uncontrollably. I almost never cry, as you know. It took Abigail hours to calm me down, but if it was up to anyone other than her I think I would have been inconsolable for weeks. She gave me a very stern talking-to the next day, of course, and you got extra dessert for a little while after that.

In retrospect, I think the severity of my reaction was appropriate, though I should have handled it differently. If anything, that day should have affected me even more. I still took you to the park after that, and still let you run around in the trees. You started spending time alone in there, as well. I always made sure to keep an eye on you, of course - the thicket was small enough that I could see almost all of it from my bench - but I still wish I was more careful. I know there’s something to be said for giving children some freedom, letting them make mistakes, and not being a helicopter parent, and I know things probably wouldn’t be much different even if I’d kept you out of the forest, but even so, if I could do it over, there is no chance I would let you anywhere near that park.

Two months after the chalk incident, I happened to fall asleep at the park while you were off in the trees alone. Now, I know a certain amount of narcolepsy tends to come with advanced age, and I’m not immune to it, but I was sure that I could always keep myself awake when I needed to. I had never felt myself close to nodding off while watching you before, and if I had any inclination that I might fall asleep, I would not have taken you to the park without additional supervision. I firmly believe that my error was taking you there in the first place, not inattention. The things I dreamed there all but confirm it, in my view.

I woke up sharply and suddenly, as though something had shaken me awake. Awakening to the sight of the forest was profoundly unpleasant - moreso when I realised I couldn’t see you. The first instinct of any normal parent would be to call the police or search the vicinity, but I got up and sprinted towards the thicket without a second thought - the thicket that was visibly empty. If sitting on the bench instead of playing with you allowed me to save all my energy for that moment, then it was worth it, because I tore through those trees faster than I could have as a young man. Branches whipped past my face as I ran deeper and deeper into the forest. What struck me in that moment was how terrified I was for *myself.* You were in danger - maybe lost forever - and yet I still felt this horrible terror as if I was plunging into an abyss, and every fibre of my being screamed for me to turn around and save myself. I am ashamed at how hard it was to suppress that feeling and continue onwards.

I began to panic when I saw a creek snaking through the forest in front of me. I turned to continue along the creek’s edge, but found myself hesitating. Again, I was filled with selfish concern for my own life. At that point, I was convinced that you were already gone. Did I really need to throw my life away? I could turn back instead, and live the rest of my days in peace. I am terribly ashamed, but those were the thoughts that crossed my mind at the time. I stopped for almost a full second before I started again along the creek’s path.

I finally caught up about five minutes later. You were standing in the middle of a clearing, ringed by birch trees. Your head was tilted upwards, watching and listening. I kept my gaze towards the ground and put on a burst of speed towards you, grabbed you and slung you over my shoulder - you didn’t resist - and took off in the direction I came.

It only took a minute to cover the distance to the park and leave the forest behind us. I didn’t look back or slow down until we reached our house.

That was the night that we got a call from the hospital saying your Grandma Abigail had passed away. It happened while we were at the park - she had suffered a heart attack while at the grocery store. The hospital had been trying to reach me while I was out, but my cell phone didn’t start ringing until we got back to the house. It feels wrong to mention this without saying more about it, but I’m going to leave it there anyway.

I know it’s in poor taste to state the moral at the end of a story, but in case it hasn’t come through clearly enough, the moral of this story is that I am so sorry for all the ways I’ve failed you, but I love you more than anything, and there’s nothing in the world I wouldn’t do to keep you safe and happy and healthy.

I love you, Abby. You’re a wonderful young woman, so brave and selfless and smart. It’s hurt me so much to see all that you’ve been through in the last few years, but I’m so proud of how strong you’ve been, and I know your Mom and Dad and Grandma all feel the same way. I promise that things will get better, even if they have to get worse first.

I wish I could tell you more about what’s out there. I tried for a few years to write an account of it, but I just can’t seem to dredge it up. I can remember a collection of feelings, facts, and vague ideas, but no proper memories. I’ve been putting what I can on paper when it comes to me, and I’ll attach my notes to this letter.

Feel free to talk to me about any of this if you’d like, I’ll be around as long as you are. Just remember not to say goodbye, and please don’t talk about wanting to leave or when you might do it - if you go, just go.

Love,

Grandpa Peter

For the record, I never blamed my grandfather for anything, not even the chalk. I knew what kind of man he was, and he never broke my trust. I knew that if he made mistakes there were usually reasons behind them.

In the months after my grandfather gave me the letter, I talked with him a few times about his life, what he’d been through, and what he thought I might go through. I think I might write those conversations down next. I don’t have recordings or anything like that, so I’ll have to write from memory. I think it’ll be a good exercise: my writing, someone else’s story. I hope that might help me feel more comfortable with finally sharing my own story.

It seems I lost the sheet of paper that was attached to the letter, where my grandfather wrote down those notes he mentioned. I wish I had it, as it would be helpful to have a little more than just memory to go on.

I can’t promise that I’m going to write more, since this was just the easy part. But I hope that I can.
