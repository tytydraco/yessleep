“So… are you human?” I asked. 

I braced for the neat little lie. That easy “yes” to cover whatever he really was. But he didn’t answer. Didn’t blink. His eyes stayed locked on something I couldn’t see, and in that stillness, something cold slid down my spine. I’d hit a nerve.

And suddenly, I wasn’t sure if the only ally I had in this nightmare was really an ally at all. He let me walk into this job blind. Never said the rules could change. Never warned me they could overlap, or that the Night Manager could just appear and peel me apart. He only ever comes after, like he’s just here to inspect the wreckage.

Maybe that’s all he’s allowed to do. Or maybe I’m just an idiot. I hate that I see it now. I hate that I’m starting to wonder if he’s just another cog in this machine. Life has taught me one thing: don’t trust anyone completely. Not even the ones who stay.

And if I can’t trust him—then I’ve got no one.

I stared, waiting for anything—a blink, a twitch, a word—but he stayed carved out of stone.

“Guess that’s a no,” I muttered.

Finally, he moved. Just barely. His hand tightened on that battered clipboard, not like he was angry, but like someone holding on to the last thing they have. When he spoke, his voice was softer than I’d ever heard it. “You shouldn’t ask questions you already know the answer to,” he said. And for the first time, it didn’t sound like a warning.

It sounded like an apology.

I didn’t know what to do with that. “Right,” I said. “Got it. Curiosity kills, et cetera.” But the look on his face stayed with me—a flicker of pity that I hated almost as much as the Night Manager’s grin. Because pity means he knows exactly what’s coming.

That thought sank under my ribs like a splinter, sharp and deep, while the fluorescent hum filled the silence between us. Then, just like that, he left. I still had thirty minutes before my dreaded shift, so I did the only thing that made sense:

If there’s no information about this place outside the store, maybe the answers are hidden inside. I went into full scavenger mode, tearing through every aisle, every dusty corner, every forgotten shelf. No basement—I’m not suicidal.

And what I found was… nothing. Before 10 p.m., Evergrove Market is just a store. No apparitions. No crawling things. Just normal. I was ready to give up when my eyes landed on the cabinet in the employee office, the one that held my contract. Locked, of course. Old furniture, heavy wood—one of those with screws that could be coaxed loose.

It took me seven long minutes to drag it out from the wall. And that’s when I saw it:

A back panel. Loose.

I pried it open.

Inside—paper. Stacks and stacks of it, jammed so tight it looked like it had grown there. Old forms, yellowed memos, receipts so faded the ink was barely a ghost.  And beneath all of it: a ledger.

Not modern. Thick leather, worn smooth, heavy with age.

My hands shook as I pulled it out. Names. That’s all at first. Pages and pages of names, written in the same precise hand. Each one had a column beside it: their rules.

Not the rules.

Their rules.

Each person had a different set. Some familiar. Some I’d never seen before. And next to some of those rules was a single thin red line. Crossed out. The names with those red marks?

Also crossed out.

It didn’t take a genius to figure out what that meant. Sweat slicked my hands, but I forced myself to keep turning the pages.  Every worker had their own invisible walls. And when they broke one—when they failed—They weren’t written up.

They were erased.

At the top of one page, in block letters:

PROTOCOL: FAILURE TO COMPLY RESULTS IN REMOVAL. NO EXCEPTIONS.

Underneath was a name I didn’t recognize.

Rule #7 beside it was circled: Do not leave the building between 3:02 and 3:33, no matter what calls you outside.

That line was crossed out in red. So was their name.

The deeper I flipped, the worse it got. Dozens of names. Dozens of rules. And every single one ended the same way—blotted out like they’d never existed. My stomach turned.

This wasn’t a ledger.

It was a graveyard.

I snapped pictures with shaking hands. When I checked my phone, the names were there— Except the crossed-out ones. Those spots were blank.

Like the paper had erased itself the second I looked away. A cold, crawling dread sank its teeth in. I wanted to keep going. To find my page. But the thought of seeing it—of seeing an empty space waiting for its first red strike—It felt like leaning over my own grave.

Not worth it.

I was about to close the book when a fresh page caught my eye. The ink was still wet.

REMI ASHFORD – RULES: PENDING

No rules. Just my name. Waiting.

I didn’t even have time to breathe when the ledger slammed shut.

No wind. No hands.

Just a deafening CRACK, so fast it nearly crushed my fingers. The sound rang in the empty store like a gunshot. I jerked back, heart in my throat, watching it settle on its own like nothing had happened. And for a long, long time, I couldn’t move.

The leather was warm when I finally touched it again. Too warm.

I didn’t open it again. I didn’t even look at the cover this time. I just carried it back to its shelf and shoved it into place, heart pounding so hard I thought the shelves might rattle with it. And that’s when it hit me. The old man knew this was here. He knew about the ledger, the names, the rules and he’d been watching.

Taking notes.

Every time he glanced at that battered clipboard, every time his eyes lingered on me like he was measuring something—it wasn’t just a habit. He’s been keeping score.

Keeping track of how long I’ve lasted before it’s my turn to be crossed out. The thought settled like ice water in my stomach. I pressed the cabinet door panel shut and stepped back, as if just being near it could get me erased early.

The silence was so deep I could hear my own pulse. Then, from somewhere high in the store, the big clock gave a single, loud click as it rolled over to the start of my shift.

The sound made me flinch like a gunshot. I tried to shake it off, to act normal, but my hands wouldn’t stop trembling. By the time I made it back to the breakroom to grab my vest, I couldn’t even get the zipper to work. My fingers just kept slipping, clumsy and useless, because now I knew—I wasn’t just surviving under their rules.

I was being graded.

The night itself started deceptively calm. The Pale Lady came, stared like she always does, took her meat, and vanished. At this point, she’s basically part of the schedule. Comforting, in a way.

But at 1:45, something happened that has *never* happened before.

A car pulled into the lot. Headlights. Tires. Normal. And then—someone walked in. A human. An actual human. He looked mid‑twenties, a little older than me. “You got any ready‑made food? Like cup noodles?” he asked.

I just stared at him. Three whole minutes of mental blue screen before I finally said, “No noodles. Food section’s over there—sandwiches, wraps… stuff I wouldn’t eat even if I was starving.”

He frowned. “Why isn’t this a store, then?”

“It’s a store,” I said. “It’s just… not what it looks like.”

He laughed like I’d told a dad joke. “Hahahaha! Oh, that’s good—creepy marketing. Classic. Bet it works, huh?”

And just like that, he walked toward the food aisle. Laughing. And sure, I could’ve stopped him, but what was I supposed to say? “Hi, don’t touch anything, this store isn’t from Earth”? Yeah, as if that would work.

“You work here alone?” he asked, like he couldn’t quite believe it. “All night? Out here? This is literally the only place for miles. And they’ve got you—what? A girl—running the whole store by yourself?”

“Yeah,” I said, flat as the floor tiles. My eyes tracked him like he might suddenly split into twelve legs. I’d seen his car, sure. Watched him stroll in like a normal guy but it doesn’t mean a thing.

I’ve been fooled before—especially by the old man—and the clock was crawling toward 2 a.m. “I’m on a road trip,” he said casually, like we weren’t standing in a portal to hell, and grabbed a sandwich.

I tried to smile but it came out looking more like a nervous grimace on a department‑store mannequin. 

Halfway through scanning his food, he said, “Oh—actually, I want a drink too.” Of course you do. Sure, why not? Let’s take a nice, slow walk to the farthest corner of the store five minutes before homicidal creatures visit this store. 

“Juice or soda?” I asked, keeping my voice level while mentally planning my funeral.

“Soda,” he said. Totally unbothered. So I bolted. Full‑sprint. Drinks aisle.

Which, by the way, seems to get longer every single night. Either this place is expanding or I’m losing my mind. Probably both. I grabbed the first soda can my hand touched and ran back like the floor behind me was on fire.

1:55 a.m.

The register beeped as I scanned it, shoved everything into a bag, and slid it across to him. My pulse was louder than the buzzing lights.

1:58.

He fished for his wallet. I nearly snatched the cash out of his hand.

1:59.

He packed up, slow like he had all the time in the world.

And then, as the second hand clicked over—

2:00 a.m.

I didn’t even wait to see him leave. I turned to bolt but then—the bell over the doors chimed.

No. No, no, no.

Before I could think, I grabbed him by the hoodie and yanked. He stumbled, swearing, but I didn’t stop until I’d dragged him behind the reception and shoved him into the breakroom.

“What the hell?” he hissed, trying to pry my hands off.

“Shhh,” I whispered, pulse thundering.

“I’m calling the police!”

“Good luck,” I shot back, flat and low. “There’s no signal in here after ten. None. Until six.” His mouth opened to argue, but I wasn’t listening anymore. I cracked the door just enough to see.

Standing in the entrance was a little girl. Nine? Maybe ten.

At first glance, she could’ve passed for human.

But then I saw the details: knees scraped raw, blood dripping in thin rivulets down her shins; a dark, matted streak running from her hairline to her jaw like someone had tried to wipe it clean and failed.

She stood there swaying, like one good gust would knock her over.

Out here. In the middle of nowhere. At two in the morning. None of it made sense.

Then she started to cry.

“Please,” she sobbed, thin arms on the reception desk. “Please, help me. I’m lost. I need my mom. My dad—”

The sound skittered over my skin like a thousand tiny legs. “What’s that?” the guy whispered behind me, peeking over my shoulder.

I slammed my palm against his chest, shoving him back. “Don’t look. Don’t listen.”

“She’s hurt,” he said, voice rising. “We need to help her.”

“Dude. No,” I hissed.

“What is wrong with you?” he snapped, pushing past me. “It’s a kid!”

He shoved me aside like I weighed nothing and strode straight toward the reception lobby. I stayed frozen. Because I knew exactly what was waiting for him. And I couldn’t make myself take another step.

He knelt beside her, close enough to touch.

“Hey,” he said gently, “you’re okay now. I’ll help you. We’ll find your parents, alright?”

The girl lifted her head, blood-streaked hair sticking to her cheek. Her wide eyes locked on him, trembling like a wounded fawn.

“Can I ask you something?” she whispered.

He smiled, relieved. “Of course. Anything.”

Her voice dipped, almost conspiratorial. “Do you know Rule Four?”

That made him pause. “Rule four? What ru—”

Her lips curled. “Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m.” she recited, word for word.

And then her gaze slid past him, right at me.

“Well,” she said, perfectly calm now, “I guess one of you remembered Rule Four.” The tears dried on her cheeks as her lips split into a grin too wide for her small face.

Her tiny fingers closed around his wrist and the sound was instant—bone popping like snapped chalk. Her skin rippled as she rose to 7ft, shooting up like a nightmare blooming. Limbs stretching too long, too thin, joints bending the wrong way. Her face split from ear to ear, jaw unhinging, rows of teeth spiraling deep like a tunnel. Her eyes, no longer human, were pits rimmed with something raw and red.

She bent forward with a jerky, insect-like motion and bit. The crack of his skull splitting under those teeth was louder than his scream. Blood hit the tiles in warm, wet arcs. Then—gone. In one horrifying jerk, she dragged him backward into the aisles, his body vanishing as fast as if the store itself had swallowed him.

And then there was only me. The store fell silent again. The doors slid shut with a cheery chime. And in the middle of the floor, dropped from his hand: a plastic bag.

Inside—one smashed sandwich and a dented can of soda, leaking fizz into a slowly spreading puddle.

I didn’t leave the breakroom. Not for four hours. I just sat there, frozen, replaying that scream over and over until it hollowed me out. My own tears blurred the clock as I realized something I’d never let myself think before: up until now, only my life had been on the line. That’s why I never saw just how dangerous this place really is. Not until someone else walked in.

By the time the old man came in at 6 a.m., calm as ever, I was shaking with rage under the exhaustion. “There’s a sandwich and a soda at the front,” he said absently as he stepped into the breakroom. When he saw my face. He stopped.

“You broke a rule?” he asked, scanning me like he could read every bruise on my soul.

“Worse,” I said, my voice coming out like broken glass. “You didn’t tell me other humans can walk in here.”

“Other humans?” he echoed, surprised. “That’s happened only twice in a thousan—” He cut himself off, lips snapping shut.

I shot him a glare sharp enough to cut. “So you knew this could happen. And you didn't take any precautions to avoid it?” My voice cracked, but the fury in it didn’t.

I pushed past him and walked out, into the front of the store. Not a single trace of blood. No footprints. No body. Just the plastic bag with the ruined sandwich and the dented soda can. His car was gone too.

“This place has a knack for cleaning up its messes,” the old man said behind me, voice flat, like that was supposed to mean something.

“So what happened?” he asked.

“None of your business old man,” I spat. Because if he’s keeping tabs, then what happened tonight will be in that ledger too. And I don’t even know—if another human breaks a rule in your shift, does that count against you?

But as if hearing my thoughts, “Don’t worry. Violations only count if you break them yourself. Now go home. Rest. Three more nights to go.” he said, voice heavy.

I made it to my car on autopilot and just sat there, gripping the wheel until my knuckles went white. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking, but it wasn’t fear anymore—it was rage. Rage at this store. Rage at the Night Manager. And most of all, rage at that old man who sees everything and still lets it happen.

Tonight settled it: Evergrove Market isn’t just hunting me. It’s hunting anyone who crosses its path.

So if you ever see an Evergrove Market, listen carefully—don’t go in after 2 a.m. Don’t even slow down.
