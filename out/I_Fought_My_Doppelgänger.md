A few weeks ago, I woke up in what looked like my room, but the colours were off. The walls were painted a slightly different shade, and the posters were arranged differently. At first, I thought it was a bad dream or a trick of the light, but then I went downstairs.

My mum was in the kitchen, just like every morning, but when I asked where Dad was, she gave me a look that chilled me to the bone. “He’s been gone for years, sweetie. Don’t you remember?” She told me they’d divorced ages ago, but in my world, they’d been together just yesterday, bickering over their usual nonsense.

I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe I was losing it, but things only got weirder. I went to college—or at least, I tried to. The campus was completely different, the name on my ID didn’t match, and my friends were strangers who acted like they’d known me forever. My supposed best friend was a girl I’d never seen before, and when I looked in the mirror, it was like my reflection was watching me with a bit too much interest.

By then, it was obvious:It wasn’t as glamorous as it sounds. Sure, it was cool to learn that there was a whole country called Altaria where Canada used to be, and the Beatles had released an album in 1978 that was somehow better than Abbey Road. England being split into three countries, and nobody had heard of The Lord of the Rings; instead, Tolkien had written a critically panned book about gardening and everyone seemed to think that Harry Potter was a series of poorly-received horror films about a boy who gets possessed.I even found out that in this world, everyone thinks that New Zealand doesn’t exist. People looked at me like I was crazy when I mentioned it. “You mean Australia’s forgotten cousin? That’s just an old internet joke, mate,” one of my new classmates laughed. But no, New Zealand was just… gone.

I tried to settle in and accept this bizarre new reality. But as days turned into weeks, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong. I’d find notes in my handwriting that I didn’t remember writing, little scraps of paper tucked into my books or stuffed into my pockets, with phrases like “not real” and “find the way back.” I was losing my grip, and it was getting harder to pretend everything was fine.

Then, one day, after a long day at this weird new college, I came home to my room and heard a rustling noise. My heart pounded as I slowly opened the door, and there he was—me, but not me. My doppelgänger, the one who had stolen my life. His eyes were wild, and he lunged at me before I could react.

We fought viciously, knocking over furniture and smashing everything in our path. I managed to pin him down and tie him up with a rope , my mind racing with questions. “Why did you do this?” I demanded, my voice shaking with a mix of anger and fear.

“I’m the original,” he gasped, glaring up at me. “I’m the real version of you in this timeline. My life sucked. No friends, no one who cared—I just wanted a better life. So I switched places with you.”

My mind reeled as he explained. He had created a device in the garage—a box big enough for a human to fit inside, lined with complex circuits and wires that hummed with an unsettling energy. It was a crude machine, but it was his gateway between worlds.

“It’s all about superposition,” he said, catching his breath. “Like Schrödinger’s cat, but on a larger scale. You know the theory, right? The cat in the box is both alive and dead until you open it. Well, I built a box that could put a person in that same state—existing in all possible versions of themselves across every parallel universe.”

He went on, explaining that to enter superposition, you had to take a special drug he’d concocted. It was a serum that forced your mind and body into a state where you could perceive all realities simultaneously. “Once you’re in the box, you’re in superposition. There’s a hallway with infinite doors, each one leading to a different version of your life. You just pick the one you want.”

He told me he’d used it to escape his miserable life here, swapping places with me because he saw that my world was happier. But he’d come back for something he’d forgotten—some sentimental item he couldn’t leave behind. He thought I’d be at college, never expecting me to catch him in the act.

As he spoke, I stared at the box. It looked like a twisted metal coffin, thrumming with a low, ominous hum. The inside was lined with wires and screens displaying bizarre, shifting images—like CCTV footage from a hundred different lives I’d never lived.

I couldn’t let him do this to anyone else. I dragged him back to the box, ignoring his frantic pleas. He tried to bargain, promising he’d find another universe and never come back, but I didn’t care. I shoved him inside and slammed the lid shut, injected the serum in him . The box shook violently as he screamed from within, but soon, it went silent, and he was gone—sent to a harsh world of his choosing, where the sky might be forever dark, or gravity pulled in the wrong direction. 

I adjusted the settings, took the serum, and climbed into the box myself, determined to get back to my own reality. I walked the hallway, doors stretching endlessly in both directions, each one marked with cryptic symbols that somehow made sense in that place. I found my door, the one that led me back home.

When I returned, everything was as I’d left it—the right paint on the walls, my parents together, and my real life waiting for me. I dragged the box back into the deepest corner of the garage, sealing it shut and covering it with old tarps and junk. I couldn’t risk anyone else finding it, or worse—someone else crossing over from another timeline.

To this day, I keep the box hidden, buried under piles of clutter. I make sure the locks stay tight, and I never, ever touch the serum. I can’t forget what I saw in that hallway, and I’ll never forget the feeling of fighting myself for control of my own life.

Because the scariest thing isn’t that there’s another version of me out there. It’s knowing that, at any moment, they might want what I have.
