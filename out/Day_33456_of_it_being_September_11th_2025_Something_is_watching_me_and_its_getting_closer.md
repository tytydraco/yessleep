You’d think with such a big world full of so many vastly different places, people, and cultures that we'd have created more shit to do. Cooking? Done enough to be a 5-star chef in any country. Extreme sports? Done it all. Stardom? Quite proud of this one actually — I landed a role in the next *Avatar* movie. Too bad it's always going to be Thursday.

**Note to self:** If I ever do get out of this, make sure I nail that audition before the cycle is broken.

Long story short, if you can name it, I've done it. And before you comment — yes. I've posted here before.

So why write it again, you may ask? Because this time, something is different.This time, there's someone watching me.

I don’t mean like, metaphorically. Not like “God is watching” or “your FBI agent through the webcam” watching. Or even someone casually sneaking glances watching.

**No. This thing doesn’t blink.**

At first I thought I was hallucinating from boredom.I saw it standing at the end of my street last night — tall, thin, like someone got stretched in one of those medieval torture devices, whatever it's called.

Oh hey, new hobby: learn more about medieval torture devices.

But back on topic, here’s the kicker: It wasn’t there the last 33,455 times.

I went to check again, but the next loop, it was gone.

It wasn't until a few loops later I realized it never really left — just changed spots. I saw it across the grocery store parking lot. Just… standing between the carts. Still no blinking. No moving.

Safe to say I was incredibly freaked out, so I did what anyone would do in my situation: Pretended it wasn’t there and bought a LOT of alcohol.

The cashier didn’t see it. Or maybe she couldn’t.

She smiled, scanned my stuff, asked how my day was. I said I was gonna drink to forget about the fucking skinwalker that’s been watching me.

Eventually you realize you can say pretty much whatever you want and it never really matters.

When I stepped out of the store, it was gone again.

I walked around the corner to my car and saw that all the shopping carts were facing it. Perfectly lined up, wheels locked, every single one aimed straight at where I was parked.

I don’t think they were like that when I went in.

And as I got into my car, the rearview mirror caught something tall and thin standing inside the store watching.

It went on like that for a while — just watching from afar. I hadn't noticed back at the store or down the street, but it had always been the same distance away.

Everything changed 3 loops ago when it started getting closer each time I saw it.

The first time, it was halfway down the block. Next, it was on my front lawn. Last loop, it was in my kitchen.

The doors are locked. The windows too.

I hadn't really seen this thing up close till then. It was pale — like a dead body pale. Wore a tattered suit that looked like something you'd see a homeless man wearing.

The sleeves and legs were all too short for its abnormally long limbs.

His cheeks were sunken in and his eyes—oh god, his eyes. I couldn’t tell from afar, but up close I could see they’re filled with rage.

This morning when I opened my bedroom door, he was standing there. Face right up against the door.

Only this time he was smiling. His face was full of malice.

My blood ran cold and I immediately slammed the door shut. I don’t know where it's going to be tomorrow.

I realize now I’m experiencing something I thought I'd lost after the amount of times I've died and reset the loop:

**Fear. Pure, even primal, fear.**

If anybody out there can help me in any way at all, please tell me what to do.
