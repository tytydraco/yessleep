I'm Sorry Ronnie,

I had no other option.

I had to make it stop.

I couldn't take any more of those eyes.

This is a confession. Last night, I woke up and thought I saw it in the dark... in the corner, staring. But it couldn't have been. It doesn't hide. It makes itself known.

I hope that after writing this, I can sleep better. I have to get this weight off my chest.

We were twelve years old. John and I were in the middle of a sleepover. It was around 8 PM, and we had just started playing video games. John had been my best friend since we were three. We were both very competitive. A 3-liter bottle of Coke, enough candy to make our ears ring, and full control of the main TV screen in the living room while my parents relaxed in the kitchen—what more could two twelve-year-olds ask for?

"After you die here, I'm next," John said, as I focused intently, trying to prove I was better than him at Crash Bandicoot.

Knock Knock.

"Who's that?" John asked, probably trying to distract me.

"I don't know, probably someone selling something," I said, tackling a tough part of the game.

My mother walked past us to answer the door.

"I hope you don't mind, boys, but I invited someone else to your sleepover—so be nice!" my mother called out.

"Who?" I asked, not taking my eyes off the screen.

She unlocked the latch and opened the door.

A woman stood outside with her tall son behind her.

"It's Steve," John whispered.

"You're joking," I said, finally looking away from the screen.

Steve was about 5'8", a lot taller than John or me. We never hung out with Steve. Why was he here? Steve was the class bully.

"Why in God's name would my mother invite him?" I thought.

"Well, Steve, you're very welcome here. Come in—the boys are just over there playing video games," my mother said with a smile.

Steve stepped in, silently removing his coat and shoes.

"Thank you for this, Martha. I really appreciate it," Steve's mother said softly.

"Not at all! He'll have a great time," Mom replied.

Steve walked over and sat on the couch without a word. He didn't look at us, just stared at the screen. Then, he started glancing at the corners of the room—jerking his head away each time like he was twitching.

"You can have a go next if you want," I offered, unenthusiastic.

"Okay," Steve said flatly.

As soon as I died in the game, I handed him the controller and walked into the kitchen where my parents were sipping wine.

"Mom, what the hell?" I said, opening the fridge.

"James, he needs friends—especially now," she replied.

"But why at our sleepover? He bullies us at school! Just because Tim and Ger are missing doesn't mean he gets to jump into our group."

"That's ENOUGH," she snapped.

"I spoke to his mother two nights ago. He's been really down—obviously because of what happened to Timmy and Gerard. But he needs company."

"Yeah, 'cause he probably feels guilty for—"

"Nobody knows what happened to them. Now go back inside and have fun," she interrupted.

I returned to the living room.

John, who never took crap from anyone, just sat quietly, watching Steve play. This was going to be a long night.

1:00 AM.

Mom and Dad had gone to bed an hour ago.

We were on our second horror movie.

John kept glancing at the corner of the room. He tried to hide it, but the twitch in his eye gave him away.

"You guys ever do anything else besides video games and movies?" Steve grunted.

"What are you thinking?" I asked.

"I know a fun game," Steve said, his eyes suddenly alight with excitement.

"What is it?" John asked.

"Bloody Mary."

"No..." I said—not because I was scared, but because I was actually invested in the movie.

"Come on, you scared?" Steve teased.

"No, I just want to watch the movie."

"You know what happens—the virgin girl always survives. Now come on, let’s do it."

"I'll play if you do," John said, grinning.

"No, because it's a stupid game that preys on your imagination."

"Exactly. So why are you chicken then?" Steve smirked.

John looked at me, waiting for me to cave.

"Fine. But I'm not going first."

"We’ll draw for it," Steve said, already pulling out three straws.

"Wow, you're *really* eager," John joked.

"Yeah, well... I'm bored. Whoever draws the short straw goes first."

Of course—I got the short straw.

"Unlucky, mate," John said.

I sighed.

"Okay, we need matches, a candle, and a mirror," Steve instructed.

We grabbed a candle and matches from the nightstand. The large mirror above the fireplace was perfect.

"I'll get the lights," Steve offered.

"I’ll close the curtains," John said.

"Light the candle first."

I lit it. Steve killed the lights. Darkness swallowed the room. Only the soft glow of the candle remained.

"Okay, put your face close to the mirror. Say 'Bloody Mary' three times. Blow out the candle. Then light it again."

"What happens then?" I asked.

"I don’t know. You’re supposed to *see* something," Steve shrugged.

"You wanted to play this and don’t even know what happens?" I snapped.

"Just do it, man," John said.

I stepped onto the stool, my face inches from the mirror.

I inhaled.

"Bloody Mary... Bloody Mary... Bloody Mary."

I blew out the candle.

Pitch black.

Silence.

"Give me the matches," I said.

"John has them."

"No, you do," John replied.

"Just kidding," John snickered, handing them to me.

I relit the candle and looked into the mirror.

Nothing.

"Well, that was... special," I joked.

"I was hoping you’d see something," John said.

"You didn’t do it right. You're supposed to *wait* after the third Bloody Mary, *then* blow out the candle. John, your turn!"

"John, you don’t have to—"

"No problem," he interrupted, pushing me aside.

''Bloody Mary'' Chanted John

I scanned the room.

Something looked... off.

''Bloody Mary''  John Chanted Again

A shadow in the corner. Mid-sized. Draped. Like a mannequin under a sheet?

''Bloody Mary''

Then—gone. Just my imagination.

John blew out the candle.

Darkness again.

"Did it work?" Steve asked.

"Light the candle and see," John replied.

He did.

"OMG I SEE IT," he said sarcastically.

"Just turn the lights on," I groaned.

John laughed.

I flipped the switch.

Light flooded the room.

"Damn, that’s bright," Steve said, rubbing his eyes.

"Maybe that’s Bloody Mary punishing us," John joked.

His laughter faded.

Then: dread.

"WHAT IS THAT?" John screamed, pointing at the corner.

"What?" I saw nothing.

John backed into the opposite corner.

"It’s looking right at me," he cried.

Steve stared like a statue. No emotion.

"John, there’s nothing there."

"It’s still there!" John wailed, curled in a ball.

My mom ran in.

"What did you two do?!"

"We played a game—then he just—"

"He’s having a panic attack!"

"It’s still there!" John screamed.

She comforted him.

"I’m calling his mother. And yours. Sleepover’s over."

I didn’t hear from John all weekend—just his mom, yelling at mine on the phone. John wouldn’t stop crying, said he saw something in every corner.

Monday: John was absent.

Steve didn’t speak to me. He was back to his old self. Bullying. Laughing.

That night, I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. I couldn't get John's screaming face out of my mind.

Then—I saw it.

A shadow.

I rubbed my eyes.

Still there.

I turned on my lamp.

It stood in the corner.

Tall. Barefoot. Draped in a dark, almost see-through sheet. Eyes—yellow, glowing, sharp black pupils—shining through.

I froze.

It didn’t move.

I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t speak.

I slid out of bed slowly, eyes never leaving its gaze.

I opened the door.

It didn’t follow.

I closed it. Breathed.

Then—

It was there again.

In the hallway.

Same shadow.

Same glowing yellow eyes.

I backed against my door.

Heat flushed through me.

My vision turned white.

I was losing control.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Honey, wake up.” A nudge.

Light pierced my eyes as I opened them.

My mom sat on the edge of my bed.

“Huh? Oh... I’m getting up,” I mumbled.

“There’s news. About John.”

“What? Is he okay?”

“He’s missing. Since last night. Have you heard from him?”

“No... I haven’t.”

“I’m sure he’s fine. Come down for breakfast.”

She stood.

And revealed it.

It was still there.

In the corner.

Closer than before.

It wasn’t a nightmare.

It’s everywhere.

Every corner.

Watching.

Always watching.

But now—it was two steps closer.

I didn’t tell Mom. Or Dad.

Was this what John saw?

Was this why he’s missing?

I had to talk to Steve.

Steve sat beside it, but was ignoring it.

He couldn’t see it. But I could.

It had been staring at me anywhere I went—any place that had a corner. Those same yellow eyes, wide open, locked on me.

Except now, it was two steps closer from the corner. Whenever I looked away, it would reappear in the next nearest corner, always just within my peripheral.

There was no escaping it. And it was inching closer over time.

I couldn’t take my eyes off it.

"James," Mr. Donnelly, my teacher, said, snapping his fingers to get my attention.

"Yes, sir," I replied, shaking my head back to focus.

"Pay attention. Stop staring off into space," he said firmly.

No one else could see it. Only me. it took another step.

The class bell rang.

Everyone rushed out for break, but I stayed seated.

"When we return, we’ll begin our lesson on Catholicism," Mr. Donnelly shouted over the chatter.

"Steve—we need to talk," I said, grabbing his arm as he tried to leave.

"No, we don’t."

"Yes, we do." I pulled him back.

"Everything alright, boys?" Mr. Donnelly asked, eyeing us.

"Fine, sir. I just wanted to ask Steve how he did the math homework," I said quickly.

Mr. Donnelly gave us a skeptical look—like, *Why ask the D-grade kid?*

"Very well. You can work together at the back of the room. I’ll stay here at the front."

"Thank you, sir."

Steve rolled his eyes. We sat and opened our math books.

"What’s going on?" I asked, rummaging through my bag.

"What do you mean?" Steve replied.

"Why am I seeing that... thing in the corner?" I asked, subtly pointing.

It took another step closer. It was like a countdown.

"I don’t know what you’re talking about," he muttered.

"Yes, you do. Please—it’s getting closer," I said, my voice trembling, tears threatening.

Steve stared at the corner. Took a breath. Sighed.

"How many steps closer?"

"At least four," I answered.

Steve didn’t reply. He just kept staring—right through it.

"What’s happening? How do I stop it?"

"You can’t," he said, gripping his pen tight.

"What do you mean I *can’t*?" I hissed.

I looked back. It hadn’t moved. Still watching. Listening.

"A few weeks ago, a really old friend of my mum’s came over—with her son. Totally random visit. She was weirdly insistent that her son, Darren, come too. Everything seemed normal. We played games, watched football, then a movie. Our mums chatted outside in the garden. It was supposed to be a day visit, but it got late. Darren’s mum said she didn’t like driving in the dark, so my mum offered for them to stay."

"What does that have to do with... it?" I asked, nodding toward the grey-footed, black-draped figure now even closer.

"He wanted to play a game," Steve said quietly.

"Bloody Mary," I whispered.

"Yeah. He lit the candle, told me to play while he watched. So I did. Then I saw it—it—standing in the corner, staring. It was 1 AM. As soon as we finished, Darren told his mum he didn’t want to stay anymore. They left immediately. So much for being afraid to drive at night."

"They knew. They *knew* what they were doing."

"Seemed like it. As he was leaving, Darren whispered to me while I was staring at the wall... 'Pass it on.'"

He paused.

"For three days, I didn’t know what to do. It kept getting closer. Until she was practically within arm’s reach. I thought I was going insane. I didn’t tell my parents. So... I did what he said. I passed it on."

It clicked.

"Timmy and Ger..."

"Yeah. They came to my place on day four. We played. First Tim, then Ger. Ger freaked out. Tim tried to calm him. Then, on day four, Ger vanished. Tim started seeing it. He confronted me, just like you are now. I told him: pass it on. He tried. But not in time. So it came back to me."

"You *used* our sleepover to pass it to us!" I shouted in a whisper.

"Honestly, I was going to give it to the new kid. But your mum invited me over—she felt sorry for me after Tim and Ger disappeared."

"How long do I have before It... does something?" I asked, looking back at it. Still unmoving. Still staring.

"It varies," Steve said. "But four steps? I'd say you’ve got until tomorrow morning."

"Play the game with me. Take it back."

"No way."

"You gave it to me. Take it back!"

"Not a chance. You’ve got a better shot at passing it than I do. People like you... they listen to you."

The bell rang again, signaling the end of break.

As the room filled with noise, Steve leaned in.

"Please, James. Just pass it on. Because if you don’t... it’s coming back to me."

He stood and returned to his seat.

I followed—its eyes never leaving me.

"Alright, open your religion books to page 95," Mr. Donnelly instructed.

I sat, thinking. There was no defeating it. No stopping this. Pass it on—or let it take me.

It took another step.

So I did what any terrified twelve-year-old would do.

I'm sorry,

I had no other option.

Even now, though It never came back, the guilt gnaws at me. A weight in my gut I’ll never shake.

"Hey, you're new here, right?" I whispered to the kid beside me.

"Yeah. We just moved from Newdale," he said.

"Got any friends yet?"

"Not really. Why?"

"Wanna come over after school? Play some games?"

"Sure, sounds fun," he smiled.

"What's your name again?"

"It’s Ronnie," he replied.
