I bought a banana.

That’s how it started.

Not from a supermarket, not from a fruit shop, but from this weird corner stall that popped up overnight on my street. One of those rickety produce tables with a plastic tarp roof, set up beside the abandoned laundromat that hadn’t had power in a decade. The sign just said:

“BANANA: $1”

That’s it. Singular. “Banana.” Not bananas. And it was just one. One perfectly yellow banana sitting right in the center of the table, resting on a purple velvet cloth like some kind of relic.

There was a man behind the stall. Old, wiry, tall as hell, with skin that looked like baked leather. He didn’t blink. Just stared at me when I approached.

“You’re sure it’s only a dollar?” I asked, trying to lighten the mood.

He smiled, all gums. “Or four quarters.”

I was hungry. It was late. I’d been walking home from work. I figured maybe it was some weird art thing or a publicity stunt. Either way, a banana’s a banana. I handed him the coins. He slid the banana across the velvet like it was a priceless artifact.

I should’ve left it.

I should’ve walked home and thrown it in the bin and taken a hot shower and gone to bed.

But I didn’t.

I ate it. In my kitchen. Alone.

And it tasted... strange. Not rotten. Not overripe. Just... too sweet. Sickly sweet. Like if you distilled sugar into flesh.

That night I woke up drenched in sweat. Shirt soaked, mattress damp, the works. My heart was going like I’d just sprinted out of a nightmare I couldn’t remember.

I kicked off the covers, sat up — and nearly screamed.

The skin on my forearm was peeling back.

Not cut or damaged.

Peeling.

Clean and smooth, in a neat little curl, just like the top of a banana when you pinch it.

There was no blood. No pain. Just this soft, fleshy yellow stuff underneath. Not muscle. Not fat.

Something... softer.

My stomach turned. I shoved the flap back down like it would somehow reattach. I wrapped my arm in a dish towel and sat on the floor until the sun came up.

By morning, the skin looked totally normal again. Like it had never happened. The towel wasn’t even stained.

I told myself it was a dream.

A really, really bad dream.

But just to be sure, I went back to the fruit stand. 

Now? It looked completely ordinary.

A folding table. A few stacks of fruit crates. And the guy behind it — a bored-looking vendor in a nylon jacket, scrolling through his phone.

I cleared my throat. “Hey, uh... did you sell me a banana yesterday?”

He looked up. “A banana?”

“Yeah. Just one. You had these, like, really yellow ones. No brown spots.”

He gave me a polite but clearly *I’m-too-hungover-for-this* smile. “Dude, I’ve got like 50 bananas. People buy them all the time.”

“No, but this one — it was wrapped differently. Like shrink-wrapped. Had a waxy tag with some weird lettering on it —”

He cut me off. “That doesn’t sound like anything I sell.”

I stared. The fruit on the table was boring. Imperfect. Organic. Normal. None of it looked like the banana I ate.

I walked away. Confused.

That night, I woke up again.

The smell hit me first — sweet. Overripe. Rotting.

And then I looked at my feet.

My toes were splitting.

The skin had unzipped down the middle, curling outward like petals, revealing more of that soft yellow pulp underneath. No pain. Just... warmth. A strange, syrupy warmth, like whatever was under there wanted out.

I panicked.

Kept trying to wake myself from this certain dream. But I couldn’t.

I peeled my toes shut again and wrapped them in socks. Sat on the floor and waited for morning.

The sun finally pierced through my blinds. But I couldn’t bring myself to check if my feet were okay.

I didn’t even go to work the next day. I didn’t move. Just sat on the kitchen floor, drinking water and staring at my hands.

I swear the fingers looked longer. Shinier. More like a peel than skin.

Every night, the peeling got worse.

At first, it was just my fingertips — thin sheets of skin slipping off like banana peel. I shrugged it off, thinking it was dry skin. But by the third night, the peeling spread down my arms, leaving behind raw, tender flesh that ached like I’d sunburned my entire body.

The fourth night, I woke drenched in sweat. My chest and neck peeled in long, ragged strips. I looked in the mirror and barely recognized myself. My skin was patchy, yellowing in places, stretched tight like the surface of a ripe banana ready to burst.

I felt sick, weak, and every morning brought a new layer of slime and decay.

I finally cracked and got help. But the doctors were useless. No infection. No rash. Just... skin that had become sensitive. That and an overractive imagination.

But I knew there was more going on.

Then I thought back to the man at the market.

The slight sense of desperation he had. Handing me the banana with a crooked smile. Had he been through what I had?

Maybe the curse only ended when the fruit moved on.

I suddenly had a reckless idea.

I set up a stall of my own, right where I’d bought the cursed banana.

I placed a single bright yellow banana on the peeling wood counter.

Hours later, a young woman stopped by. She looked tired, eyes scanning the fruit.

“Is it fresh?” she asked.

I nodded and said nothing else.

She paid and walked away.

For the first time in days, I felt a flicker of hope.

Maybe it was over.

That night, I slept more soundly than I had in weeks.

But when I woke, I had zero appetite.

I haven’t eaten in three days.

Nothing tastes right.

Everything else is spoiled.

Except bananas.

I can’t stop.
