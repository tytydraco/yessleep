Ever since first hearing the story, I imagined what it could be, I eventually found David Paulides, and listened to so many of those cases.  What I always found interesting was the mystery of how they disappeared or ended up where they did.  Like the child whose boots were found miles away from where he went missing, and how fast they were seemingly gone.  Obviously those are real cases, which is what I thought about the Search and Rescue at first till I found the author was a writer.  However, those David Paulides cases were just as mysterious in some cases, and I loved listening to them.

So, here goes, this is a possible ending to the Search and Rescue creepypasta, which you can find here [Search and Rescue Creepypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3jadum/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest/).  I also thought the only thing missing is a video, or images to go along with the text.  So with the help of AI, as this might be the perfect scenario to test it, I'll try to create images that I can maybe use to make a video.  This is one ending which focuses on the Fuzzy man, as I always wanted more from that story.

After the incident with the stairs, I decided to quit my job as an SAR officer. I couldn’t handle the nightmares, the guilt, and the fear anymore. I moved to a different state, hoping to start a new life and forget about the horrors I had seen in the woods. But I soon realized that I couldn’t escape them. They followed me everywhere, in the form of a man with a fuzzy face.  
  


He started showing up in my dreams, taunting me with his distorted voice and twisted smile. He would show me images of the people he had taken, tortured, and killed, and tell me that I was next. He would say that he had a special interest in me, that I was different from the others, that I had something he wanted. He would say that he was not alone, that there were others like him, and that they were coming for me.  
  


I tried to ignore him, to convince myself that he was not real, that he was just a product of my imagination and trauma. But then he started appearing in my waking life, too. I would catch glimpses of him in the crowd, in the mirror, in the corner of my eye. He would follow me wherever I went, always watching, always waiting. He would leave me messages, written in blood or carved into flesh, telling me to meet him in the woods, or else. He would threaten to hurt the people I cared about, if I didn’t comply.  
  


I knew he was serious, and I knew I had no choice. I had to face him, once and for all. I had to find out what he wanted from me, and why he was doing this. I had to end this nightmare, or die trying.  
  


I packed a backpack with some essentials, and a gun with a few bullets. I knew it probably wouldn’t do much against him, but it was better than nothing. I drove to the nearest forest, and parked my car at the entrance. I took a deep breath, and started walking into the woods.  
  


I didn’t have to look for him. He found me. He was waiting for me in a clearing, standing next to a large metal object that looked like a spaceship. He smiled when he saw me, and waved his hand.  
  


“Hello, friend. I’m glad you came. I’ve been expecting you.”  
  


He spoke in a clear, human-like voice, unlike the garbled noises he used to make. His face was still fuzzy, but I could see his features more clearly. He had large, black eyes, a small nose, and a thin mouth. He had no hair, and his skin was gray and scaly. He was wearing a black suit, with a badge that had a symbol I didn’t recognize. He looked like a stereotypical alien, but somehow more sinister.  
  


“What are you?” I asked, pointing my gun at him.  
  


He chuckled, and shook his head.  
  


“That’s not important. What matters is who you are. And what you have.”  
  


He gestured to his spaceship, and opened a hatch.  
  


“Come, let me show you.”  
  


He walked inside, and motioned for me to follow him. I hesitated, but curiosity got the better of me. I wanted to know what he was talking about, what he had in there. Maybe I could find a way to stop him, or at least understand him. I followed him into the spaceship, and closed the hatch behind me.  
  


The inside of the spaceship was dark and cold, filled with wires, screens, and machines. He led me to a room that looked like a laboratory, with a large metal table in the center. On the table, there was a body. A human body. A body that looked exactly like mine.  
  


I gasped, and dropped my gun. I stared at the body, unable to believe what I was seeing. It was me. It had my face, my hair, my clothes. It even had the scar on my left arm, from when I fell off my bike as a kid. It was a perfect copy of me, except for one thing. It was dead.  
  


“What the hell is this?” I asked, feeling a surge of fear and anger.  
  


He smiled, and walked over to the table.  
  


“This, my friend, is you. Or rather, the original you. The you that I took from your parents, when you were just a baby. The you that I replaced with a clone, that I implanted with a chip, that I controlled and monitored for all these years. The you that I experimented on, and learned from, and used for my purposes.”  
  


He touched the body, and a screen lit up. It showed a series of graphs, numbers, and images, that I didn’t understand.  
  


“You see, you are very special. You have something that none of the other humans have. Something that we have been looking for, for a long time. Something that we need, to complete our mission. You have the spark.”  
  


He pointed to a spot on the body’s chest, where a small, glowing device was embedded.  
  


“This is the spark. It is a source of infinite energy, that powers your body, and your mind. It is what makes you alive, and what makes you different. It is what we want.”  
  


He looked at me, with a gleam in his eye.  
  


“And now, we have it. Thanks to you.”  
  


He pressed a button, and the device detached from the body, and flew into his hand. He held it up, and admired it.  
  


“It’s beautiful, isn’t it? So small, yet so powerful. So rare, yet so precious. So human, yet so alien. It’s the key to everything. To our survival, to our evolution, to our domination. With this, we can do anything. We can create, we can destroy, we can conquer. We can be gods.”  
  


He laughed, and put the device in his pocket.  
  


“And you, my friend, you are the one who gave it to us. You are the one who made it possible. You are the one who fulfilled our destiny. You are the hero of our story.”  
  


He clapped his hands, and smiled.  
  


“Thank you, thank you, thank you. You have done us a great service. You have done yourself a great honor. You have done the universe a great favor. You should be proud. You should be happy. You should be grateful.”  
  


He walked over to me, and hugged me.  
  


“Thank you, thank you, thank you. You are the best thing that ever happened to us. You are the best thing that ever happened to you. You are the best thing that ever happened to anyone.”  
  


He let go of me, and looked into my eyes.  
  


“And now, it’s time to say goodbye. It’s time to end this. It’s time to end you.”  
  


He pulled out a knife, and stabbed me in the heart.  
  


I felt a sharp pain, and then nothing. I fell to the floor, and saw him standing over me. He was smiling, and waving.  
  


“Goodbye, friend. Goodbye, hero. Goodbye, spark. Goodbye, and thank you.”  
  


He turned around, and walked out of the room. He left me there, bleeding and dying, alone and forgotten. He left me there, with my dead body, and my dead clone. He left me there, with my dead life, and my dead story. He left me there, and he never came back.
