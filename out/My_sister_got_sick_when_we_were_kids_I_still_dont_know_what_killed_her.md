Hey all, I recently posted on r/doctorsUK what I posted below, but the post was quickly deleted, and I was told to try here. Hopefully someone here has an answer, Lord knows I’ve tried.

When I was much younger (I couldn’t have been older than 6) I lived in a small home near the south coast of Wales with my parents and my older sister. My dad worked in construction, and was a problem solver at heart, constantly coming up with solutions to every problem we ever had. My mother was a photographer, and our house was littered with her work. Pictures of the countryside and the old castles of Wales followed by pictures of me and my sister in the garden span the walls. She definitely favoured the latter.

My sister, Alyssa, was four years older than me, which certainly gave her a sense of authority over me. However, she was my best friend growing up, and we’d spend our summers exploring near the creek, when in reality I doubt we ever left our mothers eyeline. Things were good. That was until my sister got sick.

I remember when it started, when I went to wake her up to watch cartoons with me Saturday morning. When she wouldn’t wake up, no matter how hard I shoved her. When I screamed for my parents and how my father ran to the phone and called the nearest doctor while my mother sat there caressing my sister's hair while I watched from the half-open door. I kept watching from the doorway when the doctor marched in and began examining her, and I remember wanting to cry when her eyes finally fluttered open. Looking back now, I wished that her eyes had never opened.

The next few months were agonising. After she had woken up, my dad had taken me outside and explained what happened, how they thought she had caught some kind of bug from swimming in the creek, and that I wasn’t allowed to play with her until she got better. He told me I could never go into her room unless either he or mum were in there with me. Dr. Ackles essentially became our housemate, and would regularly eat at the table with us in between work. I never really knew what he got up to in there, all I remember is watching cartoons in the living room, trying to ignore my sister's muffled wails while he worked.

I only ever saw her twice after that. My dad was on the phone with a client, mum was in the shed developing pictures, and Dr. Ackles had gone home for the day. While they were working, I was essentially alone in the house, and while I was never a rule breaker growing up, I missed my sister. I stood in front of the large wooden door. I had opened this door so many times before, but I was still reluctant. I grabbed onto the metal handle, and creaked the door open. The inside was dark, and the air inside was thick, like I was breathing tar. The light from the hallway painted onto my sister's bed, the liquid in her IV glistening. The bed had indented her shape, like she was slowly sinking into it. Her hair was greasy and long, longer than she ever had it. Her dress was stained yellow from a mix of sweat and vomit. She was noticeably skinnier, and her skin was dry like sand. Her eyes looked heavy, and months of dead skin coated her eyelids. Her gaunt face slowly turned from aimlessly staring at the ceiling to focusing on me. Her mouth snuck out into a soft smile, her lips cracking as the corners of her mouth fluttered wider. Her dry breath carried a word. A word filled with what I realise now was a mix of love and disappointment. “Maxie…”

I ran to my room, I was terrified. Hell, I am still terrified. There was no way that my sister was in there. As much as I reasoned and eventually pleaded to myself, not even my parents called me Maxie. That was my sister. After that things were different. Now, Dr. Ackles slept in the guest room, and I saw my parents less and less. Our dinners grew silent, and my sister's wails grew louder, going from weak cries for help to resentful shouts. I remember wanting to run away, this didn’t feel like home anymore.

March 23rd 1995. I remember the date to this day, since that was my sister's birthday. My parents wanted to celebrate, so they made her a cake. No one ate it. I was put to bed earlier than normal that night, and my parents seemed a lot more upset than usual. Alyssas screams were a lot louder that night, so I hardly slept. I usually slept with the door shut to try mute out the crys, so when I woke up in the middle of the night to my bedroom door wide open and the hallway lights on, I felt sick. I knew something was wrong. Before I could even get out of my bed, a whisper called out to me.
“Max” It was my sister. Her voice was deeper, and felt like it crawled out of her throat against her will
“Aly? Why are you in my room? Are you feeling better?” I said optimistically 
“No, I’m not”. I sat there paralysed in fear. Tears streamed down my face.
“Are… Are you going to hurt me?” I had never been scared of my sister like this before. She took a long time to answer.
“No”.
“Why are you awake? Mum’s gonna be upset at us.”
“They don’t control us”. We fell silent after that. I heard her start to drag her feet out of the shadow, as she came into the light of the hallway. She looks taller now than I last remembered, and her skin looked like leather. Blood caked her face, and in the darkness it looked like a boid of black where her mouth should've been. I hardly recognised her. She began to hobble out of the door, before stopping in her tracks to look back at me with a sympathetic look. “She loves you, Max”. Her head cracks back, and I can hear her bare feet slowly smack against the tile floor of our hallway all the way back to her room. That was the last I ever saw of her.

After laying in bed all night falling in and out of sleep, I decided to muster up the courage to go see my parents. Their bed was empty, and no one was home. I even checked Alyssa's room, and she was gone too. In the daylight, I noticed a trail of small drops of blood running from my room to Alyssas. Not long after, my parents came home in tears to break the news that Alyssa was rushed to hospital last night and died in the early morning. They never told me what was wrong with her. We held her funeral a week after, and I was never allowed to talk about her or enter her room ever since.

After that, my parents consumed themselves in work, which eventually resulted in dads company skyrocketing. We moved to a nice house just outside of Cardiff, but never sold the old house, with too many memories of Alyssa to let go of. I’m 35 now, and I ended up getting work as a paramedic. In my 10+ years of experience, I’ve never come across anything like what happened to Alyssa. 

That's where I come to you all. I have no idea where to go from here, surely there must be more to what happened to my sister. I’ve tried talking to my parents but they always shoot me down, and contacting Dr. Ackles has been proving difficult despite being in the medical field myself. Does anyone have a similar experience or know what I should do next? Any help would be appreciated.
