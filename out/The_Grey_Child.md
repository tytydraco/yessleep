When we got to the new house, Rose was beyond excited. She immediately rushed to the old swing that hung from the crooked tree in front of the house. “Mommy, look at high I can go!” she yelled. I looked at her with relief.  I wasn’t sure if she would accept moving to a new city after the death of her father—my husband, Chris. Our new house was fairly small and was surrounded by a large wheat field.  As I watched Rose swing, I noticed a grey figure in the corner of my eye standing in the wheat field, but when I looked there was nothing and no one there. “Must be seeing things” I told myself, but I felt as though I was being watched. I yelled at my daughter to come inside and get settled, she did just that. 

After a while I decided it would be best to tour the nearby city with Rose so we could get familiar with it. We both hopped in the truck and I turned the key to the ignition. “I miss daddy” said Rose, I responded “I do too”.  Right before I pulled out of the driveway I noticed something in the rear view mirror. A small grey child standing in the window that peered into the living room. In the brief glance I got, I could make out that there were large black orbs in place of its eyes, its skin was a grey color, it had no mouth, no hair, no ears, no clothes, and no other body parts. I blinked and it was gone, I kind of felt a little creeped out but decided that it was just in my head. I drove away from the house and towards the city.

After getting familiar with the city, it started getting late, so I drove back home. Rose jumped out of the truck and ran to the front door. She opened the door and right before she ran inside, she stopped and started to cry.  I ran to comfort her and looked inside. My husband’s decapitated head was resting on a small
table set in front of the door. My heart began to race. I hurried Rose back to the truck and hopped in the driver’s seat. As I began to to drive away I saw the child again, standing in the wheat field, staring. But this time, he didn’t go away he stayed there and stared as I drove off. I called the police and gave them my address.

The police searched my house, but they didn’t find a head or any signs of forced entry.  I told them about the kid I kept seeing in the wheat field but they just recommended me to a therapist and left.  I decided that it was probably just some sort of hallucination like the grey kid. “But how could me and my daughter hallucinate the same thing?” I thought.  I disregarded this thought and me and Rose went back inside. I tucked her in and kissed her goodnight. “I’m scared” she said. “Don’t worry sweetie, whatever we saw probably wasn’t real.”

Morning came. I stayed up all night, I couldn’t sleep. I heard the front door open, I jumped out of bed and rushed to my daughter’s room, she was gone. I ran to the front door and saw out the window that my daughter was swinging on the swing, and behind her, stood the grey child, who had now formed a mouth, a smile. I slammed open the door but as I went outside they were gone, both my daughter and the grey child. I called the police again and reported my child missing.

-1 week later-

I couldn’t sleep, again. I pulled myself out of bed and made myself a coffee. Just then, I heard something coming from outside. A rope being tightened. I run to the front door as fast as I can and slam it open. The swing was gone, in its place was a single rope, a noose, and hanging from the noose, was Rose. Her throat and wrists slit. Beside her stood the grey child in the wheat.
