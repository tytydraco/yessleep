From the moment I remember myself, I was with Jacob. He was that one friend that stuck out. He was supportive, understanding, honest. He was the only person that tried his best to cheer me up whenever I was down, the only person to keep me company whenever I was feeling alone, and the only person to just listen to my dumb problems. He was my best friend and I was his. I knew him since I was very little and we basically grew up together in this shithole of a town. 

I was so bored here. I always felt like I never belonged or that this town didn't deserve me. I had so many ideas and dreams about how I wanted to live my life in the long future and I was so bored of just waiting for school to be over so that I could get out of here. Jacob felt the exact same way. We had plans to go to college together and study astrophysics or something crazy like that. Heh. To kill time, I started searching for something I really liked. Something that no matter how many times I would watch, play or read, I would not get bored of. And then my interest in horror began. Movies, stories, books, games. I absolutely adored the mystery and the imagination it fed me. I discovered this love of fear along with Jacob and we were seriously addicted. We wanted to express it though, so we decided to start a podcast.

It almost didn't surprise me when our regular talks managed to hit the ears of our beloved classmates in that damn school in this totally not gossipy town. I didn't mind though, in fact, I think I liked the attention. In my mind, it was almost perfect; me and Jacob doing the thing we loved and being popular at the same time. It felt surreal and I had second thoughts about leaving this town. At the time, my microphone was lost and I was furious about not being able to talk about crimes, serial killers, or urban legends. Jacob would continue the podcast without me. At least until I'd find my mic. I was happy that he did.

For our next episode, we had a great idea. I had been searching for myths and tales in our on the web for a long time. I remember the excitement I felt when I came across articles of people being obsessed about a dark, shadowy creature lurking in corners of abandoned buildings and isolated places. Now, I had read tons of shit about "entities" or "ghosts" or "creatures" stalking people and such. I never really believed them but they intrigued me. However, I had never read about something like this in our town. So, Jacob and I decided to instead of simply going to places to investigate like usual, actually invite people with us. And those people would come from our audience. We thought that making "interactive" episodes like that would bring our podcast even closer to success. And to no surprise, we had volunteers. They were 3 kids from our school, our age. I recognized them but I'd never really hang out with them. It was Nick, Marlene, and Nicole. God knows how many times they would shove in our faces that they were in a relationship, Nick and Marlene. The whole school knew, I'm guessing the whole town too. Not only that but that Marlene and Nicole were best friends too. The aftermath of having social media in such a small town. 

Anyway, after a bit of research, we found a wrecked place that used to be a hospital, and there were alleged appearances of that thing. We told the others to bring some stuff including flashlights, umbrellas because it was raining, pocket knives in case of an ambush, and cameras for potential evidence. We gathered at a spot near the center of the town at midnight and began our walk to the hospital. On our way there, there was a lot of talking from the others. Nick was making jokes to scare Marlene and Nicole seemed eager to be with us. At one point, she asked me where had I been and why I wasn't appearing on our then-recent episodes. I explained my situation and that I was feeling so frustrated by that. I glanced at Jacob and he avoided eye contact with me. That's odd I figured, but I brushed it off.

We were there. It wasn't really visible in the dark so we turned on our flashlights and we saw it. It was a medium-sized hospital that had parts of its walls tumbled down, lots of broken windows, and tall, green grass around it. In front of us were two slightly opened doors that had their color faded. On the ground was a lot of mud and a couple of footsteps could be seen. Marlene let out a gasp and Nick hugged her. I briefly remember Nicole smirking almost as if she wanted to laugh. "Let's go" said Jacob and we went inside. The atmosphere of the building had a weird tone to it like something didn't feel right. The air was cold and I was feeling tickles on my back. I pointed my flashlight up and I saw a dusty sign saying "Main Hall". There were lots of stuff to explore; chairs, beds, offices, files. "That's some real shit" said Nick while Nicole was going crazy touching everything and running around. Marlene was holding Nick's hand seeming quiet. Jacob and I warned them not to get lost and to record anything that seems weird.

A while later, having explored the bigger part of the ground floor I let out a sigh that turned to a scream when I felt something wet and slimy on top of my head. Before I could even touch it, it fell down my face covering my eyelids. I wiped it with my hands and I felt disgusted when I saw it was a thick black liquid that was kind of shiny. I cleaned it off and I turned my head up to see it leaking from the gaps in the top floor. "Could have been worse" said Nicole pointing to the stairs leading up. Jacob seemed absorbed as he took photographs of me from every angle possible. "Can you quit now?" "Yeah, sorry". 

We walked up the stairs and got to the first floor. The first floor seemed a little bigger with lots of rooms and a big open window at the end of the hall. Quickly we spotted a paddle of black slime inside some small holes in the floor. "Maybe we should go" said Marlene; "Com'on now that the fun's starting?" replied Nicole. "Guys stay focused, we have a whole new floor to examine" said Jacob. "I say we do it separately" suggested Nick. "Great idea, we can cover more ground in less time that way" I said. I ended up with Marlene and Jacob was with Nick and Nicole, going the opposite way of us. Marlene and I went into the first room which was relatively small and had a broken patient bed in the corner. It didn't have anything strange though so we agreed to leave. I tried opening the door and it wouldn't budge. Before I could react to it I heard something coming from the bed. It was a muffled voice talking loudly until it started screaming. I was petrified and didn't know what to do. It had been a while since I had felt that way. Marlene started crying and banged on the door. We heard banging coming from the other side until the door fell down revealing the others. The muffled screaming was gone. They asked us what happened and we struggled to make out words. 

A pair of fast footsteps could be heard on the other side of the floor sprinting towards us. It sounded like that person had put glue on their shoes and it made that sticky sound. We pointed our flashlights there and nothing was seen but a photograph falling down. Nicole grasped it before it fell and what she saw shocked her to the core. Her eyes began tearing up as she put her hand on her mouth. She handed it over to Nick with a blank expression as if she saw someone die. It was a picture of her and Nick. Her and Nick kissing on a bed next to Marlene sleeping. Nick was furious. He started punching and kicking the walls. "What kind of prank is this you sick fuck?" he shouted. When Marlene saw the photograph she started gagging, fell down, and gasped for air. Jacob and I were speechless trying to connect everything that had happened together. After we did, Jacob put his camera and flashlight inside his bag, held my arm, and said "We're leaving". I let out a confused "What?" as he dragged me to the stairs. 

When we left everyone else and made it to the bottom of the floor we witnessed something so horrific I can't even put into words as I'm writing it. It was a huge mass of slime in front of the entrance doors that started to move toward us. Out of instinct, I pointed my flashlight to see it carefully and saw it was the same slime that fell onto my head. A shiny black thick slime that had human hands coming out of its body. The hands kept hitting the floor lifting the whole slime in the air. It made these unearthly muffled sounds as it moved. It came to a halt and then its hands began tearing out its body. We watched frozen in horror until the slime started forming something. Something like a human face. It was Jacob. Jacob holding what seemed like my microphone. My lost microphone. I couldn't believe what I was seeing at first, but at some point, it was so clear as if looking in the mirror. I turned my head to Jacob who was already looking at me with a sad expression, tears falling from his eyes. "Jake?" I whispered. The black slime suddenly started melting to the floor, never to be seen again. I fell down struggling to stand to my feet. 

To this day I am still baffled by these events, but at least I have come to some big realizations. Jacob never talked to me again after that. I deleted the podcast from every platform. Everyone asks me what happened to it and I have nothing to say. Thankfully, Nick, Marlene, and Nicole ended up okay and I still sometimes catch up with Marlene. We have been searching for this "entity" ever since but have not come to a clear answer yet. I have not told anyone about this and neither hasn't she. I feel safer talking about it here rather than in real life.
