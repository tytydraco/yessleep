Something’s following me, and I can feel myself beginning to change, somehow.  

I was hiking with my friend Greg when I made the mistake of walking down some stairs into an earthen tunnel just off a mountain forest trail in West Virginia. I assumed the Greg I met when I came back up the stairs was the same one I’d left behind. He wasn’t. And I didn’t really realize what had happened until I was already far away from the spot I came through. And I think, until I can find those stairs again or another set like them, I’m trapped here. 

If you want to know exactly how it all happened, it’s in my last post. 

This world looks a lot like ours. There are things here that look like regular people, like my friends and family…at least until they open their mouths. When I tried to escape them I barely got away. They converged on me the instant they realized what I was doing, and I thought that was it.

And then one of the reminders on my phone alarm went off. 

It makes the sound of a bell chiming over and over again. The things that looked like my family all started screaming and covering their ears. That’s when I saw their teeth—razor sharp, like a shark’s. I left the alarm on as I ran like hell for the nearest treeline. By the time I reached it, my phone’s battery had died. I kept running. I ran as hard and long and as fast as I possibly could. I don’t even know how many of them, if any, tried to catch me. 

It’s dark here, even during the day. Weirdly dark. The sky is always clouded over, and the leaves and pines needles overhead grow so thick they almost block out the whole sky anyway. Things here look normal, but it’s like everything is just a little bit wrong. Alive in ways it shouldn’t be. I got desperate enough to try picking and eating some random berries. The little spray of black at the top of them that I thought were leaves turned out to be spindly, curled-up legs. The “berries” swarmed up my arm and bit me. Now it’s covered in boils. 

It even smells bad here. Like something’s rotting no matter where I go. 

But the worst part is the deer…thing. About fifteen minutes after I first stopped running, by the time I stopped breathing so hard that I couldn’t hear much over my own breath and the crunch of leaves and sticks as I walked, I heard the footsteps. It didn’t take me long to identify that they weren’t human or human-like. That it was something with four legs. I have spent a lot of time in the woods, after all.  

By then it was night, and everything was really dark.  I could barely see anything, and was mostly moving forward by feel. That’s when a voice called out from behind me. Greg’s voice. Not the fake Greg, but the real Greg who spoke English. 

I froze on the spot. I wanted to call out to him. It made sense that the real Greg would have followed me down the tunnel when I didn’t come back out, that he might now be here in this world with me.  But I don’t trust anything about anything anymore. 

The footsteps and the calling continued. I looked over my shoulder a lot, squinted into the dark, trying to see what it actually was. 

When I finally made out what looked like a pair of antlers on a very definitely four-legged body, I took off again. But I was slow and clumsy. Tired, starving. Pathetic. The thing kept a steady pace behind me, but from the sound of it, it was struggling too. It must have been, or else it definitely would have caught me. But I was getting more exhausted by the second. 

What felt like hours into this, I stumbled across a cave. The opening was long but extremely low to the ground. The kind of thing I might be able to get into and out of easily but which some weird-ass deer creature could not. Or at least I hoped so, because I was just too tired to keep going.

So I slid into the cave. Lying on my belly, I felt around carefully to see how high the ceiling was throughout the space and to check for drop-offs. I found that there was just enough room for me to sit up. And then I found something else. Something that felt like canvas, and then a zipper, and straps…it was a backpack. 

I unzipped it, felt around, and actually thanked god out loud (even though I don’t technically believe in him) when I found, among other things, a bottle of water, a flashlight, granola bars, beef jerky, mini usb cables, a miniature folding solar panel…and a portable battery bank. The downside of turning on the flashlight was that it allowed me to see the dried blood stains all over the outside of the pack. 

Before long, I heard the footsteps again. I turned off the flashlight. They got closer, and closer. For a long time, the thing seemed to pace back and forth, maybe a yard or so outside the entrance of my cave. It called my name. It called for help. Again and again. 

“I’m human,” it said, over and over. “It’s me, it’s me.” It made weird, choked-off sobbing sounds. “It’s just me.” 

I lay there and didn’t move a muscle until finally the pacing and the pleading stopped. 

I charged my phone. I ate and drank. I wrote this. I feel…weird. I feel like I’m even writing differently than usual. I don’t know how to explain it. Anyway. I’m going to sleep now because I just can’t not anymore. I’m not sure why I’m writing this down. I don’t have internet out here in the woods,  but it helps to think this might not be the end, after all, and maybe I’ll get a chance to post this somewhere. Maybe I’ll meet other people who went through this, and I’ll feel sane again. 

Anyway, goodnight.

It’s not a deer. 

When I woke up, it was lighter outside. I couldn’t hear anything but more-or-less normal forest sounds. I looked out the cave, trying to avoid being seen by anything already out there. I just saw trees. Grabbing the backpack I dragged it out of the cave with me. There was a spot outside where the underbrush was all pressed down, like something had bedded down in it. There were reddish-brown smudges on the leaves and in the dirt. 

I tried not to think about it too much, and started on my way again. The plan was to walk north, back in the direction of the forest I’d first come through in.  

I walked for about two minutes, and then I stopped. 

The deer-thing stepped out of the deeper shadows just up ahead of me, into what passed for bright light in this place. And I saw it clearly for the first time. Saw the human flesh and the human bones, pulled apart and contorted until they fit the vague approximation of a deer. Saw exposed ribs spread too-wide at the bottom and the loose loop of intestine that hung from the open cavity to drag below it. A bit of actual deer had been fused in too—specifically the antlers and part of a skull. But the eyes were still Greg’s. 

I screamed. I turned. I ran. 

That was a while ago. I collapsed in the most sheltered spot I could, when I could, and fell asleep again. I haven’t seen the deer…Greg…since I first ran from him. Now I’m near a small town, and I’ve got service again. I guess that must mean there’s a town there back in my own world, too. I guess WiFi crosses the multiverse. Who would have guessed? 

I’m resting as I write this, eating the last bit of beef jerky. Pretty soon, I’m going to have to find some other source of food, unless I find a way home first. But people in my last post said that this might be the fae realm, or the place where those stories come from, anyway. What if what they say about the food is true? What if eating it will really trap me here for good?

I guess I better hope I get out of here, and soon. Really soon. I’ve kind of…stopped being scared of this place…and that worries me. Now the only thing I’m scared of is Greg. I feel so guilty for just running away from him, but what could I possibly have done?
