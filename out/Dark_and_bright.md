As many other Tuesdays, I woke up to the blinding light that enveloped my room, a uniform, sterile white, rounded little chamber: smooth white walls curving gently into the ceiling and floor, forming a space without shadows. The bright lights hummed softly, pushing back the horrors of the outside world. There were no corners, no crevices, no angles where darkness could take root. Just clear, brilliant light.

As I stepped through the door, the clarity followed me into the main shelter. The vast bunker stretched before me: an open space of round chambers like mine, bathed in artificial light. People moved through the space in a sleepy trance, exhausted but alive. With pale skin as a result of years spent under fluorescent light. The air smelled of sweat and metal, a reminder of the fragile world we clung to - no deodorants, no perfumes, just bags of flesh desperately holding on to life. Outside, beyond the reinforced walls, the shadows slithered, waiting for their chance to creep in.

I made my way to the communal area, where fatigued voices spoke of rationed meals, power generators, and the terrifying reality that even the smallest shadow could invite the creatures inside. I spotted Laura - her tired smile gave me a flicker of warmth in this sterile world. I had known her since the early days, when we met in the bunker just as the darkness claimed the rest of the city (the rest of the world? Impossible to know). Beside her stood Daniel, one of the engineers who maintained the generators - by far the most important job in our small community. He was reliable and capable, someone I trusted completely. A good friend.

"Did you sleep well?" Laura asked, though we both knew the answer.

I ran a hand through my messy hair, already showing signs of balding despite being only 26 years old. "As well as I could," I replied.

No one in the bunker had slept well in years. The blinding lights, a necessary survival measure, prevented deep rest; we all saw the insides of our eyelids glowing red the moment we tried to sleep. Minutes later, exhaustion would knock us out, and a couple of hours later, we would wake up - tired, sore, drained, and depressed, but alive.

I headed to the kitchen to queue for my daily ration. Like every Tuesday, I welcomed (as much as one could in these circumstances) a plate of rice with stewed vegetables and protein. "Never ask about the protein" was the common saying.

Then it happened.

A flicker.

It was subtle at first, just a faint hesitation in the lights, like a shiver through the relentless fluorescent tubes. People froze mid-movement, mid-conversation. The electric hum stuttered. Then, with a soul-crushing silence, the lights failed completely.

Screams filled the bunker as panic erupted. A few emergency lights flickered, struggling to stay alive, as if they, too, feared the darkness. But the shadows spread. In the shifting dimness, something moved. The creatures had arrived. Every precaution had been taken - had it not been enough? How long would the batteries last? How long would the fuel hold out? There was no time for questions, only survival.

I grabbed Laura’s arm and ran. Daniel shouted something about the backup generators, but his voice was lost in the chaos. People leapt toward the few bright spots left, desperate to cling to safety, but the lights were fading fast.

This wasn’t possible - every measure had been taken, every calculation made, countless expeditions carried out for batteries, generators, backups, fuel. It just wasn’t possible.

Someone had done this.  
Someone had let them in.  
Someone wanted them to enter.

In the gloom, a shape moved differently from the others - calm, deliberate. It was Victor - he had always kept to himself in our little society, he was always… strange, but today, he was different: with a faint smile, reassuring and friendly, his sleepy eyes like everyone else’s, and his disturbing calm, he spoke without looking at anyone directly – although, to be honest I felt he was looking at  me.

“The shadows are not the enemy,” Victor called out through the chaos and screams. “The shadows are salvation.” He repeated it as he walked through the darkness without hesitation. “Surrender to the darkness, I promise you everything will be alright.”

His weary body contradicted his strong, steady voice. Before everyone’s eyes, the darkness swallowed him whole. One second, he was walking; the next, his collapsed body was dragged into the shadows by the creatures.

One by one, everyone fell. Some fought, clinging to the last remnants of light, but inevitably, they succumbed. Yet, as each person fell, their terror seemed to fade. Their eyes closed, and their bodies relaxed.

In my final moments, beneath one of the last working lights, I didn’t feel fear - I felt relief. I gripped Laura’s hand tightly and whispered, “There’s nothing left to do. Just let go. I love you”

My eyelids succumbed to the gloom, and the creatures' violent claws transformed into gentle, caring hands, carrying me with caution into a world of darkness. For the first time in years, my eyes finally rested. Laura, beside me, also let herself be pulled into the darkness, our hands slipped apart as we disappeared into the void.

My last thought – Years of this… for nothing.

With the bunker almost completely consumed by darkness, Daniel, the engineer who had kept the generators running for ages, watched as all efforts proved futile. The gallons of diesel had never been enough, nor the solar panels, nor the batteries, nor the anti-shadow measures. The last light above him flickered twice, then went out.

Everyone was dragged by the now-gentle claws of the darkness—into the abyss, into the unknown.

I woke up to a blinding light that engulfed my room - sterile, white.

“Charlie, can you hear me? Move your head if you can hear me. Can you squeeze my hand?” repeated a man in a white coat. “My name is Victor. I’m your doctor.”

The bright light gave way to shapes and faces. Among them, Laura - older than I remembered her - was crying with happiness. “You’re finally awake, baby.”

Beside her, Daniel held my hand. “You’re back, brother.”

The man in the white coat brought me a cup of water with a straw and said, “I’m so sorry, but I need you to tell me everything you remember about the light, the shadows, and the creatures - everything, from the beginning, in full detail - quickly before you forget.”

Daniel and Laura leaned in close, whispering softly into my ears:

“You have to remember. Forgetting is death”.  
“Tell him everything you remember, brother. Don’t forget anyone. If you do, they can’t come back

Panic jolted me awake, and I tried to recount a fading dream. As I spoke, I looked around - hundreds of hospital beds… in nearly all of them, other doctors were saying the same thing:

“We need you to remember. Remember them all.”

I woke up from one nightmare into another. Now, a different kind of darkness: oblivion.
