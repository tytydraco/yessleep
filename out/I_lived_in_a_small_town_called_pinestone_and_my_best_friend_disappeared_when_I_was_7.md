There are stories about things that go on in little isolated towns. I've lived in the great north woods of Michigan for most of my life. I lived in a little town called pinistone in the copper country as a kid. See Townes like pinestone are pretty Isolated hell I'd be surprised if you could even find a map that marked the place. Perhaps that's for the best though as I would come to realize as I grew places like pinestone should just be forgotten, growing up in the copper country you hear all sorts of rumors and myths like the wendigo, yellow mike, dog men but the one that always scared me was the jagers. The story says that the town of Pinestone is watched by the jagers, a group of people descended from a group of German trappers back when the natives owned the land. They used to hunt elk deer, moose bison, you name it they hunted it until they hunted most of them animals up here to near extinction it was at that time some say the hunters were cursed to hunt their fellow man.  Parents used to tell us kids if we misbehaved the jagers would take us away from them. I never really believed that story until a friend of mine disappeared. Her name was Marlene but I always called her Mar. Marlene was a transplant her parents were trolls from down below the bridge. I never understood the hatred of those from the lower peninsula they all seemed nice enough to me and Marlene was no exception. 


We had been friends for most of our childhood, that was until we went camping. My dad decided for my birthday to take me and my friend Marlene camping, now dad was a seasoned hunter and fisher but Marlene's dad insisted he come with us which my old man agreed too much to me and Marlene's dismay. I remember the day clearly. We had set up camp in the middle of the forest in a place me and my dad liked camping. I remember me and my father decided to go fishing in the late afternoon on the coast of Lake Superior it was a mostly peaceful venture aside from accidentally hooking my old man near his eye, I should've looked behind me and he shouldn't have been behind me but he got the hook out and we started back to camp when we heard Marlene scream. I remember running as fast as I could back to the camp but we were too late . The tents had been torn to shreds and a trail of blood led into the forest. I never did see Marlene again, the police labeled the event as a cougar attack but I know the truth I know why my dad warned me of the jagers. I won't lie to you, it's been twenty years since I questioned Marlene's disappearance. I believed the story that a cougar attacked her and her father that day.  


I moved on after a while. I eventually moved away from Pinestone down to Houghton and eventually married a woman who for her safety I won't name before taking a job on a charter fishing boat. I eventually had my own daughter who again I won't name here in case they happen to read this. I didn't think of Marlene until my little girl and I were walking through the forest and she found Marlene's backpack hanging on a tree. I was surprised to see it after all these years but even more surprised by the fact that it looked just as it did the day she disappeared.
