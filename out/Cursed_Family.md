What I’m about to tell you is based on my personal experience, or rather… it’s not over yet, so to speak… Anyway, here’s the story.

I’m a 23-year-old man, working as a caregiver and living with my family.
Our family consists of my father (52), mother (44), younger brother (18), and me. My brother was planning to start living on his own this spring for his new job. That evening, after dinner, we were all in the living room watching TV – my father, mother, and I. 

We were discussing things like “Where should our brother live?” and “What does he need for living alone?” Meanwhile, my brother was in his room (we shared the same room), preparing for his job (I guess?).

Za za… za za za za…

Suddenly, there was a noise on the TV. It quickly subsided, so I didn’t pay much attention and continued watching TV while saying, “…so, yeah.” But when I shifted my gaze to my parents, I noticed something strange.

Both of my parents had their mouths half-open and were staring at the TV with wide-open eyes, as if they were shocked by something. 
“!!… Huh!?… What!? What just happened!?” I asked, feeling disturbed by their unfamiliar expressions. “…………” However, my parents ignored me and kept watching TV.

Suddenly, only their wide-open eyes were looking at me. 
“!!!! Huh!?” The next moment, as if nothing had happened, my mother said, “Yeah, but our brother cooking for himself…” and my father said, “Isn’t it okay? Right, son?” and they started talking.

“No… Wait a minute! What was that just now!? What was that!?” Both of my parents are not the type to make jokes or play around, and they have always been serious and strict. So, I couldn’t possibly imagine them doing something like that as a joke.

My mother asked, “What do you mean by ‘just now’?” and my father said, “??”. They both had confused looks on their faces. Knowing their personalities, I realized that their reactions were not to deceive someone, but their genuine reactions, and at the same time, it felt strange.

“Uh… ‘Just now’… I mean…” I mumbled and looked down. My mother asked, “By the way, when will you die?”
“What?” My father added, “Yeah, we should talk about that too. When are you going to do it? Suicide? Or an accident?”
“What?” I couldn’t understand the meaning. 
I was quite puzzled by the sudden barrage of events. I stammered, “Uh… huh? I… die…? Huh?…” But my parents continued the conversation as if it were completely normal.

Father: “I’ve been waiting for this as well. It’s about time.”

Mother: “I’ll help you. It’ll be okay. Right?”
My parents continued to talk calmly.
They discussed things like hanging, sleeping pills being a good option, and how jumping off would be painless if you faint midway.

It was as if they had seen it before…
In snippets of their conversation, I could hear laughter, as if something was amusing…
“Wait… Wait a minute!!! What the hell are you saying since earlier?!”
Feeling anxious and scared by my clearly different parents, I shouted loudly.

My parents turned their faces towards me.
“Uh…!!!”
Their eyes were facing in opposite directions.
Father: “Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die”
Mother: “Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die”
“Ah!!!!!!”
Their eyes were facing in opposite directions, but their faces were firmly directed towards me.

Like broken dolls, they repeated “die” over and over again.
Unable to bear it any longer, I fled to my brother’s room.

Bang!!

Brother: “Whoa! That scared me! What’s wrong, big brother?”
My brother was sitting at his desk, writing documents.
“Uh… Listen! Dad and mom… their eyes were facing in opposite directions, and they were saying ‘die’… Oh! Before that, there was noise on the TV…!!”

Brother: “No, sorry. I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

I didn’t even understand what I was saying.
I couldn’t comprehend what was happening to me right now.

“Listen… Listen, I mean… That’s why…”
Unable to understand anything, I held my head,
“A-anyway, dad and mom are acting strange…!!!!!!”
My brother had his mouth half-open and wide-open eyes…
“Oh… Ohh…”
My parents became strange, and now even my brother…
As I watched my brother’s eyes gradually facing in opposite directions, I ran towards the entrance.

What is this?! What is this?! What is this?!
Before stepping outside, I glanced at the living room.

My parents were standing, facing towards me.

Their eyes were indeed facing in opposite directions…
I ran at full speed to a crowded area. After catching my breath, I called my coworker, who lived alone, explained the situation, and went to their house. This coworker could see spirits and ghosts, and they listened attentively to my incomprehensible story.

Coworker: “I see… Alright, tomorrow let’s go to a temple of an acquaintance and ask for help. Rest for today. You look terrible.”

I stayed at my coworker’s house that day. Needless to say, I couldn’t sleep a wink.
The next day, my coworker had a night shift, and I had a day off. At 6 o’clock in the morning, my coworker drove me to a temple about 30 minutes away, where I explained what happened the previous night to the head priest.

Head Priest: “I understand… It must have been tough. You look completely exhausted…”
Looking at my face, the head priest expressed concern. After that, they said, “We can’t leave it as it is,” and decided to return to my house with my coworker and me.

The inside of the house was hell.
My father was walking through the living room and hallway, blood dripping from both his arms and legs. In the corner of the living room, there were several blood-stained knives discarded.

“After two more rounds, I’ll cut the artery in my right leg…
After three more rounds, I’ll cut the vein in my upper arm…”
He muttered to himself.

My mother was in the bathroom. 
She was repeatedly submerging her head in the filled bathtub and resurfacing.
Pressing her own head with her hands…
“Ahaha, gulp, ahaha, gulp, ahaha, gulp…
Just before death!!! Just before death!!! Just before deeeeeeeath!!!”
My brother was sitting at his desk, writing. However… he had a cutter in his hand, and there was a mirror on the desk.

“City A, Town B…”
He was engraving our home address on his body.
I cried in terror.

Afterward, the three of us managed to get help from the head priest and other monks who were called for support. We are fine now. However, there are still scars on my brother’s and father’s bodies, and it greatly depresses me when I go to hot springs or similar places.

I apologize for the lengthy and poorly written text.
After that, I asked the head priest, and it seemed that the cause of my family’s transformation was rooted in our ancestors. You know those lines you hear in period dramas like, “I curse you and your descendants for generations to come”? It seemed to be a real-life version of that.

Moreover, the curse was brutal. It wasn’t just about killing us outright. It involved possession, gradually tormenting the family over time. 

That’s what I was told. However, this time, the curse couldn’t be easily executed. It turns out that in my past life, I was a high-ranking monk, and the curse couldn’t touch me from the moment I was born. 

Frustrated by my immunity, they resorted to using my family as a means of pressure, repeatedly commanding them to “die.”

But I managed to escape, and they said, “Well, if we can’t have him, at least the rest of the family…” However, the curse was so potent that the head priest couldn’t completely remove it, and the rest of my family always carries protective charms.
The curse is still ongoing.
