I grabbed Sarg's leash off the hook by the door. His ears perked up, and he bounded over to me, tail wagging like crazy. “Ready, boy?” I asked, clipping the leash to his collar. He barked in excitement, already pulling me toward the door.

It was late afternoon, the sky still bright but the sun beginning to sink. We headed down the familiar path that ran behind the neighborhood, through the woods. Sarg trotted beside me, nose sniffing the ground, ears alert to every sound. This was our routine—just me and my dog, out for our daily adventure. It felt good to get away from everything for a bit, just us.

The further we walked, the quieter it got. The rustling of the wind in the trees was soothing at first, like nature's lullaby. But as the woods thickened around us, the air grew still. Too still. I noticed it right away—no birds, no squirrels scurrying in the underbrush. Even Sarg slowed down, his nose twitching, ears cocked. I could feel his tension through the leash.

“Come on, buddy,” I said, trying to sound confident. But there was a knot in my stomach now. Something didn’t feel right. The path was getting darker, the trees casting long shadows over the dirt trail. The wind picked up again, but this time it carried a strange sound with it—low and distant, like a moan. I froze. Sarg's ears shot up, and a low growl rumbled in his throat.

I told myself it was just the wind. It had to be. We kept walking, but my pace quickened. Sarg stayed close, his eyes scanning the trees. The further we went, the more the woods seemed to change. The trees, once familiar, now twisted into strange shapes. Their branches stretched out like fingers, clawing at the sky. The path was barely visible now, swallowed by shadows.

I stopped, looking around. I wasn’t sure if we were still on the right trail. Panic began to creep in, and I tugged at Sarg's leash, ready to turn back. But Sarg wouldn’t budge. His growl deepened, his fur standing on end.

“Come on, Sarg, let’s go,” I urged, pulling harder. But he planted his feet, staring into the trees.

Then, I saw it.

Between the trees, just beyond the path, something moved. At first, I thought it was just the shadows playing tricks on me. But it was there—a figure, tall and thin, lurking between the trunks. My breath caught in my throat. Sarg barked, lunging forward, but I yanked him back, fear gripping me.

The figure moved again, closer this time. I couldn’t make out its face—just a black silhouette against the darkening woods. Its movements were jerky, unnatural, like it was glitching through the trees. And then, it stopped.

It looked at me.

I couldn't explain how I knew that it was staring, but I felt it deep in my chest—a cold, creeping sensation like ice water running through my veins. Sarg's barking echoed through the trees, but the figure didn’t flinch. It stood there, watching, waiting.

I bolted. I didn't care about the path anymore. I just ran, dragging Sarg behind me as fast as my legs could carry me. The woods blurred past, branches whipping at my face, thorns snagging my clothes. My lungs burned, my heart pounded in my ears, but I didn’t stop. I could feel it behind me, that thing, chasing us. Its presence pressed down on me like a heavy weight, suffocating me.

I glanced back—just for a second—and saw it, closer now, its long limbs reaching out, its face still hidden in shadow. My foot caught on a root, and I stumbled, hitting the ground hard. Sarg barked, circling me, trying to pull me up. I scrambled to my feet, adrenaline pushing me forward.

Finally, we broke through the trees. The woods spit us out into a clearing near the edge of the neighborhood. I could see the rooftops in the distance, the streetlights flickering on. I didn’t stop running until we were back on the road, houses in sight, the nightmare behind us.

Sarg was panting, his eyes still darting back toward the woods, but he stayed close. I doubled over, trying to catch my breath, my heart still racing. When I finally looked back at the woods, there was nothing. No figure, no shadowy silhouette, just trees swaying gently in the breeze.

But I knew what I saw. What we saw.

I’ve never taken that path again. Even Sarg refuses to go near the woods now, and every time we walk by, I swear I feel eyes watching us from the shadows.
