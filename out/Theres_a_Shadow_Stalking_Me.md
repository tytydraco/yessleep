**Chapter 1**

Jared sits in his apartment, on his favorite divot on the couch. The walls of Jared’s apartment aren’t just bare; they are closed off, suffocating, as if the bricks have somehow drawn closer to him since he last noticed them. The hum of the fridge is louder today, or maybe his mind is just quieter. It buzzes like the anxious rhythm of his thoughts, just waiting for him to fill the silence, yet he can’t. Every surface in the room feels foreign, like someone else’s apartment he’s somehow been stuck in for too long. On the television, sitcom laughter erupts, the noise sharp against his ears. The chatter of the characters fills the room, a distraction from the silence he dreads. It’s in moments like these that his mind betrays him, conjuring her voice, her laugh, the sound of her key in the door.

There’s a lot to do, the threat of the LSAT looming dreadfully. Jared scheduled a test date around a time he’d likely need an effective distraction. A February test date offers the illusion of progress, but progress requires effort. There’s a birthday card for his boss sitting blank on the table and an essay due tomorrow at midnight, each task no more than a fleeting thought in his unmoving haze. Because for now, Jared just sits. For a month and a half, give or take, just sitting has been his most practiced hobby.

Eventually, as it always does, his hatred of himself for putting aside all of his responsibilities overrides the numbing of his brain. He opens his laptop, the light of the screen shocking his bloodshot eyes. His fingers begin to move, almost on their own. With every tap and click, he feels his senses returning. Jared has always had the skill of making himself sound a lot smarter than he is. It’s incredible how a potato-brained fool can be a legal analysis savant for two thousand words in Times New Roman, double-spaced font. Well, five hundred words for now—genius and effort have their limits.

Next, attention shifts to LSAT review note cards. The cards in Jared’s hand are supposed to be his ticket out of this perpetual haze, but every time he flips one, it feels like a mockery. Each word is a betrayal.

*Quixotic.* He repeats it over and over, until it no longer makes sense, a jumble of syllables that reflects how his brain feels—overstuffed with information he doesn’t want and unable to hold onto anything that matters. He rubs his eyes, trying to clear the fuzziness clouding his vision. The letters shimmer for a second, twisting and warping into something indecipherable. He blinks hard, and the word returns to normal.

Must be the lack of sleep, he thinks, tossing the card onto the table. But the unease lingers, curling in the back of his mind like smoke.

Now, the most heartfelt and passionate birthday wishes are due. It isn’t that Craig Evans, esteemed manager of the prestigious Burger Barn, would actually care. But Jared’s performance review is coming up, and every little bit helps.

Jared sits with the blank card, the ink of his pen a fleeting connection to something outside of himself. He doesn’t care about Craig Evans or his birthday. But he knows that if he doesn’t at least make an attempt, it will be another reminder of what he hasn’t done, another mark on the list of things he can never finish. What is a greeting, a gesture, compared to the silence that swallows everything else?

His focus breaks as his attention is drawn to his phone. The glowing notification stares back at him like an accusatory finger. His stomach sinks. Of course, he forgot about the appointment. What else is new?

The thing about Jared is he holds an expertise in two skills, actually. One is sitting and doing nothing, and the other is forgetting. His boss’s birthday card will have to wait until after his appointment with Dr. Wright, which he’s now on pace to be ten minutes late for.

\*\*\*

“I’ve just been chillin’ to be honest.”

“Now Jared, I can’t and won’t force you to share more than you’re comfortable with. But you might find these sessions more helpful if you can give me a little more detail.” Dr. Wright looks up from her notes, her kind eyes offering an inviting expression to Jared. Her warm smile establishes an aura of trust.

Jared chuckles, his cheeks blushing slightly out of embarrassment. “My bad, I’m still in homework mode. I’ve been doing okay. Trying to work the piano a little bit more, and I’ve been going to the gym more often.”

Dr. Wright nods thoughtfully. “How’s your diet been?”

“Fine,” Jared says, avoiding her gaze. He notices her raised eyebrows and frown, prompting him to add, “I’ve been doing better. I try to schedule times to eat so I don’t forget or lose track of time, you know, with LSAT stuff and work.”

As Dr. Wright nods her head, her hand begins to scribble. As she writes, Jared is drawn to a bowl of spearmints that sit between him and his therapist. Their smell is strong in breaking the air but gentle on his nostrils. The walls are adorned with paintings—probably a side hobby of Dr. Wright’s, Jared assumes. One sits on the east wall, staring directly at him. It’s a dog, it’s just sitting there, just staring. Behind the dog is a beautiful meadow. The unnaturally green grass contrasts with red, blue, and yellow flowers. The pure blue sky is broken by ghastly clouds, somehow softening the already serene environment. It’s all nauseatingly calm, annoyingly perfect.

“That’s a good habit to build,” Dr. Wright says, jotting down a note. After a brief pause, she looks up again. “How are you doing with staying in no contact?”

Jared shifts in his seat. The question breaks his calm, and he feels the pressure inside himself begin to rise. “I mean... I just...” He takes a moment to compose himself. “I don’t know, really. I’ve just been doing nothing. I guess there’s nothing to do, so I’m doing nothing. Does that make any sense?” Dr. Wright nods, but Jared feels exposed, like she can see past the shrug, past the nonchalance. The quiet presses down on him, and his mind screams, Say something else! Anything else! But all he can do is sit there, the silence loud in ways it shouldn’t be.

Dr. Wright’s tone remains gentle. “I understand. It can be hard to accept situations for what they are right now. But taking this time to heal is important. Think of it as a chance to reconnect with yourself—to figure out who Jared is, outside of anyone else. It might feel uncomfortable, but it’s good to know the value you have by yourself.”

By himself. That’s exactly the reality Jared has been trying to avoid. It’s the reality that makes itself known in the moments of silence. It’s the reality that makes itself known when he cooks, by himself. When he cleans, he does it alone. When he listens to the same songs, watches the same movies, he does it by himself now.

“Well Jared, that’s all the time we have for this session. I want to challenge you to keep up with your journal, and recognize how your emotions continue to shift with everything.”

Jared stands from his seat, his brow furrowed, mouth tightening into a faint grimace. “Thanks, Dr. Wright,” he mutters, the words automatic. She gives him a small nod, her warm expression unchanged, as though she’s accustomed to goodbyes that don’t quite stick.

The receptionist flashes a polite smile as he walks past her desk, but Jared doesn’t meet her eyes. The faint humming of fluorescent lights fills the lobby, blending with the muted tap of keyboards and the shuffle of papers. He steps into the elevator, pressing the button with more force than necessary.

\*\*\*

As the doors slide shut, Jared exhales, his eyelids heavy. The growl of the elevator motor fills the small space, leaving no room for distraction. In the quiet, his mind drifts—not forward, but back. And with that drift comes a familiar ache. His thoughts wander, unbidden, to places he’d rather avoid, ghosts of conversations, the echo of laughter that feels like a punch to the chest.

It’s always like this. In the quiet, his mind doesn’t drift; it digs. Callused though it is, it still knows where to press hardest. His mind slips to a distant time, to the beginning.

He can’t exactly describe how he felt the first time he met her. It was strange—like tasting a food you instantly love but can’t compare to anything else you’ve ever eaten. How do you describe something so new? Like discovering a completely new color—how do you begin to name it? How do you attribute value to it in your own mind?

Their first conversation was casual, nothing out of the ordinary. Jared had given her some general advice as she prepared for college, nothing he hadn’t said to others before. But this time, something felt different. Every time she smiled, a warmth stirred in him. When she began rambling question after question, her nervous energy on full display, he found himself grinning back. Her anxiety was palpable, almost endearing, and he’d never been so drawn to someone so preoccupied with the smallest details.

There was something about her—something he still struggles to put into words. Her brown eyes didn’t just look at him; they seemed to look into him. They pierced, not like a knife, but like a vaccine, soothing the sickness he hadn’t realized had taken hold of his heart. Sharp and striking, their shape added an edge to her beauty, pulling him further into her orbit.

Her long black curls framed her face perfectly, tumbling over her shoulders with effortless strength. Her skin was soft, her hands delicate, though they carried the strength of her cautious confidence. She intrigued him—the confidence she kept buried under layers of careful precision, the contradictions that made her more compelling with every word.

Every sentence Jared spoke to her felt like walking a tightrope. With each exchange, he whispered a silent prayer that it wouldn’t be his last.

Eventually, the last sentence came—years later.

\*\*\*

The elevator jolts slightly as it reaches the ground level, the doors sliding open to reveal an eerily empty parking garage. The fluorescent lights reflect off the scattered cars, the uncanniness unsettling. Jared’s car sits near the corner, its familiar silhouette a small comfort amidst the emptiness.

With a sharp chirp, the car’s lights flash as Jared unlocked it. He stepped inside, the stale, warm air giving way to the cool rush of the AC. He let out a deep sigh, gripping the wheel as though grounding himself. The silence that had accompanied him from the elevator was warded off by the blaring of a pop hit from the radio, the upbeat tune clashing awkwardly with his mood.

Shifting into drive, Jared pressed the gas harder than he intended, the tires giving a brief squeal against the concrete. His pulse quickened, the sudden jolt breaking through the fog that had dulled him all day. The empty parking spots blurred past, white lines flashing in his peripheral vision like distant beacons. The overhead signs became checkpoints in a mindless race to nowhere, pulling him into a fleeting, hollow focus.

His focus would remain until a figure, a man, appeared in the path of his headlights, seemingly out of nowhere. Jared’s breath hitched as he slammed the brakes, the screech echoing through the garage. The car lurched to a halt, stopping mere inches from the man.

Jared sat frozen, his heart pounding like a drum in his chest. The figure stood motionless, bathed in the harsh glow of the headlights, his silhouette sharp yet strangely indistinct. Was it fear? Or something else entirely that kept him rooted in place?

Snapping back to reality, Jared fumbled for the window controls, rolling it down to stammer an apology. The words caught in his throat as he looked up.

The man was gone.

The space in front of his car was empty, the concrete stretching endlessly into shadow. Jared blinked, his chest tightening. His eyes darted to the mirrors, to the corners of the garage, searching for any sign of movement. Nothing.

Whatever had just happened, Jared couldn’t explain it. And yet, it left him with a lingering unease that seemed to seep into the air around him.

\*\*\*

The upbeat pop hit blared through the speakers, but Jared wasn’t listening. His hands gripped the steering wheel tightly, knuckles pale against the dark leather. He drove in a kind of autopilot, the lines on the road blurring together.

In the silence between songs, he thought he heard her voice. Just for a second, faint and fragile, cutting through the noise like a ghost. He turned the volume up, drowning it out. But the ache in his chest didn’t go anywhere.

As he pulled into the parking garage, he whispered under his breath, “It’s just in your head.” Saying it out loud didn’t make it feel any truer.

As Jared pulled into the parking garage of his apartment building, a dull ache throbbed in his head, each pulse a reminder of the five, or sometimes four, hours of sleep he was forcing himself to run on. The exhaustion clung to him, heavier now that he was back in the familiar confines of home.

He parked in his usual spot, the tires crunching softly against the concrete. As he stepped out, a soft cooing caught his attention. The pigeons were there, as they always were, perched on the concrete divider that separated the floors.

They recognized him.

With fluttering wings, they descended to his feet, their tiny claws clicking against the floor as they waited expectantly. Jared couldn’t help but chuckle under his breath. “What’s up fellas? At least some things never change.”

Reaching into his bag, he pulled out the small stash of crumbs he always kept for them, remnants of stale bread or crackers from the week. He sprinkled them on the ground, watching as the birds eagerly pecked at the offering. Their simple contentment was oddly grounding, a brief pause in the storm of his mind.

As Jared scatters crumbs on the ground, the pigeons descend as usual, their tiny claws clicking softly against the concrete. But one of them, a larger bird with dark eyes, remains still. It stands apart from the others, its gaze locked on Jared, unwavering, as though it could see him in a way nothing else could. Jared can feel the weight of its stare, an unspoken question hanging in the air.

"What’s your deal?" Jared mutters, tossing a crumb its way. The pigeon doesn’t move. Its head tilts slightly, and for a brief moment, Jared feels as though it was studying him. He shakes his head and turns toward the elevator, the soft click of talons echoing behind him longer than it should have.

The inside of Jared’s apartment was as still and quiet as ever. The occasional drop of ice cubes in the refrigerator and the faint clicks of the pipes were the only sounds separating him from the oppressive weight of total silence.

In the bathroom, Jared opens the cabinet and grabs a fresh towel. He strips down with a wince as his back protests the movement. Maybe skipping a post-workout stretch hadn’t been his best decision. “Yoga tomorrow,” he mutters to himself as he steps into the shower and twists the knob.

A shock of ice-cold water crashes onto his head and neck, forcing a gasp from his lips as his muscles tense. His breath hitches, body shivering, before the water begins to warm, cascading over him like a gentle barrage of bullets. As the tension melts from his body, a soft exhale escapes him.

The droplets are steady and rhythmic, their touch oddly comforting. Jared barely registers the thought as it passes through his mind: *This is the closest thing to contact I’ve had in over a week.*

Time slows, the bathroom walls fading into the background. His eyelids slide shut, his head tilting back as the water traces rivulets down his skin. In this brief moment, Jared is alone with himself, and just for now, he doesn’t hate the company. He could almost drift away, enveloped in the warmth, lost in a fragile peace.

Jared allows the water to continue to run over his face, shutting out the world for a moment. His chest rises and falls in slow, deliberate breaths. *It’s fine,* he tells himself. *I’m fine.*

But the truth seeps through, clinging to him like the steam in the air. It isn’t the silence he hates; it’s the way it reveals things he works so hard to ignore.

He thinks of her, how she used to tease him for taking showers so hot they turned his skin red. He’d laughed it off then. Now, the memory scalds, leaving a mark deeper than the water ever could.

Then comes a thud.

The sound is loud and sudden, reverberating through the shower door. Jared jolts, throwing himself to the side, his back hitting the cold tile wall. Terror grips him as his eyes lock on the frosted glass. Through the fogged surface, a figure stands on the other side.

It mimics him perfectly, pressed against the door, its outline indistinct but unnervingly human. Jared’s chest heaves, his breaths shallow and panicked. The figure remains motionless, a stillness so absolute it feels wrong—like staring at a statue carved from the void itself.

They stay like that, frozen in a silent standoff. Seconds stretch into an eternity, Jared’s legs trembling as adrenaline courses through his veins. His vision blurs, his consciousness threatening to slip away. His lungs burn as if the air has been stolen from the room.

And then, with a wrenching gasp, Jared’s awareness snaps back.

He finds himself curled on the cold, wet floor of the shower, arms and legs tucked in a desperate fetal position. The figure is gone. Only the steam clinging to the glass remains.

With a shaky breath, Jared rises to his feet, shame mixing with the remnants of fear as he turns off the water. The silence creeps back in as he dries himself off and completes the rest of his nightly routine, avoiding the mirror and its potential reflections.

Lying in bed, his muscles still tight from the encounter, Jared clenches his teeth. His mind swirling with questions, the memory of the almost-collision in the parking lot and the eerie figure in the shower refusing to settle.

Confusion swirled until it blurred into exhaustion, and slowly, he drifted into a restless sleep.
