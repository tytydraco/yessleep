My name is Mitchell, I'm currently 38 and my brother Toby is 36. We both had a great childhood growing up on our parents property in Pennsylvania in the 90s, it's something I can't really explain unless you lived through it as a kid yourself. Things were just simpler and combine that with having a loving mother and father that always had time for us and it was an amazing time to be a kid, there was one thing that always struck me as odd however. My father was never an angry man, he always had a cool and calm demeanour like most Pennsylvanian farmers but he was relentless about telling Toby and I to never go in his toolshed, he always had a very serious look in his eyes and used a stern voice commanding us not to go in there, it must have not been good enough for him to just tell us not to go in there because he eventually put a padlock on the toolshed door so we wouldn't be able to get in without a key.  

It was strange to me how serious he was about it but I chalked it up to him just not wanting us kids messing with his tools, after all he did have some pretty expensive power tools in there like chainsaws and weedwackers to take care of the property so I could see why he wouldn't want us in there but it always weirded me out how serious he was about it but our mother just told us to listen to our father and do as he says so that was that. 

Eventually Toby and I grew older and left for college and would come back to visit every spring break, our parents always loved having us back at home to visit and I always enjoyed seeing my folks again too. Over time though we both started visiting less since we both had jobs and our own lives going on but our parents understood and didn't try to guilt trip us into visiting more and then one day a couple of years ago was the worst day of my life, my brother and I both received the call that our mother and father had both passed away. They had been coming home from visiting some friends across town when a semi truck's brakes malfunctioned and slammed right into them and they were both killed instantly.

I was devastated and Toby was visibily upset as well when I went to his house to check on him. We both immediately went back to our home town to attend our parent's funeral, it was heartbreaking losing them so suddenly but it was comforting to know they both died right next to each other and didn't have to live without each other. They left us the house and property we grew up on in their will and so after the funeral Toby and I decided to go back to the house to sort out what items to keep and what ones to sell, we had a great time together revisiting memories from our childhood and teenage years and it was a good distraction from the mourning of losing our folks.

 After a while I brought up the toolshed to him and asked him if he remembered how angry our dad used to get telling us to stay out of there, he said "Well yeah, how could I forget that. After a while I was starting to think that's where Dad kept his porno mags" he chuckled, "yeah how hilarious" I replied sarcasticly "something about how sternly he used to tell us not to go in there always weirded me out you know" "well why don't we go check it out then?" He replied. I agreed and we made our way to the toolshed behind the house, after all these years the padlock was still on the door of the toolshed and we had no idea where the key was, there was an axe nearby my father used to cut firewood though so I used that to break open the lock and the door swung open. 

The toolshed sat as it had for decades, my father's various powertools and hand tools hanging up on the wall and a table sat at the end of the small room used for working on his chainsaws. "I don't get it, what was he hiding in here that he wanted us to stay away from so badly" I said, Toby replied "if it wasn't porno mags then I have no idea". The room's light bulb wasn't working so I reached for the flashlight left on the table and began scanning the room, everything seemed normal and nothing seemed out of place. That was until I noticed a small bit of white tape on the wall directly in front of the table, I removed it and it revealed a small hole in the wall only about the size of a golfball. I put my eye up to the hole and couldn't see anything as it was completely pitch black and then I made the mistake of pointing the flashlight into the hole so I could see what was inside and what I saw was pure terror. 

As I scanned through the hole I realized there was a large crawlspace type of room below this toolshed and that's when I noticed the bloody bits of meat hanging on hooks on the wall, I should've turned around and left then but I couldn't stop myself from looking. As I continued to scan I noticed large bloodstains on the rotting walls of this clearly very old crawlspace and that's when I saw it, there was an old rusted metal bed without a mattress in the crawlspace and there was a mutilated corpse chained to it. Bloodied limbs hung from hooks above the corpse and the floor was stained with blood and entrails. I felt sick to my stomach and my brother could tell something was wrong with me and asked me what I saw, I just shoved him and told him to run. We ran back into the house so I could catch my breath and tell him what I saw. 

I explained to him the horrors I saw when I looked through the hole, a horrified look appeared on his face as I told him about it and he ran to get the will our parents left behind to see if there was anything they knew that we didn't. It was so much to process all at once, the grief of losing our parents and the horrifying site I just witnessed in that toolshed, I hadn't taken the time to process what I had witnessed when I came to a chilling realization. The bloodstains and corpse in that crawlspace were fresh. I felt goosebumps appear on my arms and a chill run up my spine when I realized this and then my brother came back into the room looking even more terrified than when I told him what I saw. He held up our parents will and the only instructions on it were "STAY OUT OF MY TOOLSHED"
