My mother had me at the age of 16 and my father left us before I was born. I grew up having her come in and out of my life as my nannie was the person who cared for me walking hours to take me to and from school. Once I turned 11 my mother took full custody of me. My mother wasn't a nice women several times she beat me and I knew she regretted having me "taking away her life" but she needed me for goverment money. A few years later my mother met her boyfriend through our neighbour who comes from a very rich family, he was a very well-off man himself being one of the heads of a well established plane engine company.   


We already didn't like each other as he didnt want to have children and my younger sister was born when I was 7 so he was already taking in two children he didnt really care for. After 3 years of my mother being with her partner I witnessed him "spanking" my sister rather aggressively. This caused me to attack him defending my sister, we had a aggressive fight. After my mother not taking my side I went emotionally dark on my mother for choosing to stay with him.  


After few months my mother started leaving me alone at our house and staying with her boyfriend for long peroids of time only dropping by every 1-2 weeks to drop off various amounts of food. The house I was living in was a horrible-mess. My mother hid the fact she was a horder from her boyfriend, her bedroom was a vile mess of mold growing on the walls, mugs full of the blue mushroom mold and rotting clothes sitting around the floor. Her hoarding got so bad it ended up over flowing into mine and my sister room (We had bunk-beds). So I was forced to sleep on a sofa that was older than myself I had no real idea on how to look after myself. I was going to school smelling bed, having no friends or any form of people to talk to. I started to try and push myself into sports which I regret because this is where I started to hate my life. I shattered my ankle playing rugby forcing me to stay home and with nobody there to care for me. I spent days at the time laying on the sofa and dragging myself to the bathroom with nobody there for me. My uncle (who is a drug addict) would stop in and visit to check in on me. (and to do drugs in my kitchen and crash on a fold out sofa in there). He would come and go after a while he stopped coming to "visit" as the police knew my kitchen was his drug usage place.  


After a while of no human interaction and nobody around to check up on me I became extremely depressed and start to hate my existance. Only eating mayonaise on bread and tubs of ice-cream because at the time a tub was 50p and it would fill me up. 

**I thought I was alone but I wasn't.**  


After so long I started to have dark nightmares where I was still on the sofa laying there but dark figures would stand over me for hours on end. No faces, no features just darkness it was always a tall man. After awhile the nightmares got worse the figures leaning in getting closer and closer to me. Still not facial features nothing just a void of nothing.  


After awhile I started skipping school due to lack of sleep because I knew If I slept I would see these figures but because I was not sleep and avoiding school with nothing to do I would lay on this dirty sofa just laying there like my life had no meaning (and thats how I felt).    


I started not eating due to not leaving the house and our tap-water was dirty so I didnt drink any water. I became so malnourished I was turning into skin and bones. I ended up spending a few days sleeping in the bathroom after puking my stomach acid. I wasn't far from being that malnourished I could of died, luckely my uncle made a random stop by and called an ambulance I ended up in hospital having a spinal tab without numbing agents.  


After a few days in hospital I was sent home without any notice to my mother so she didnt know what happened. I spent the next few months thinking I could die and with the medication I was on and being a child I didnt really "respect" the dosage and the nightmares became to "real". I started to accept the shadow figures just laying there awake even with them hanging over me scared but accepting.  


After awhile I made a friend on "bebo" and hung out with her at the weekend she got me to hangout with people I didnt know and I started to feel better and after a few more years the figures slowly dissapeared.  


Me and my mother dont speak rarely we speak via email and thats it.  


Thats my story.
