So last week my new phone arrived. First day I got it I did all the setup bullshit. Sign in to Google, transfer my number, redownload all my apps, transfer pictures and videos, make sure all my accounts are logged in. Typical stuff. I didn't buy a case or screen protector since I'm on a bit of a budget lately. I value eating more than anything. And before you ask why I bought a new phone on a budget, my old phone stopped holding a charge. Not much of a mobile phone if it has to be plugged in to use it. Whatever. I have a new one now. It should work fine as long as I don't drop it. Knock on wood.

Update: Last night I was eating some leftover lamb and I heard a weird noise. I slipped my phone into my back pocket and sat down at the kitchen table. Pretty much as soon as I sat down I heard a prolonged grunting noise coming from my phone. No, I wasn't watching anything weird. I was reading an article about various factors that affect the trout population in the midwestern United States. I took my phone Out of my pocket and looked at the screen. It was turned off, but the noise continued. I guess that's what I get for buying the cheapest phone available.

Update: Today I was scrolling through reddit, just checking out r/gamecollecting coveting other people's belongings while sipping my coffee, typical start to my day off work. I set my phone down for a second to refill my mug and when I came back the light next to the camera was on. If you didn't know this just tells me that the selfie camera is active. I've never had a phone with one before now so I figured I would explain.Â 

Update: This morning I woke up late. I slept through my alarm. I was going to call my boss but I saw in my call logs that a call was made around the time I went to sleep that lasted for several hours to a number I didn't recognize. I don't remember calling anyone. Did I do it by accident while I was asleep? I tried to call it again but all I got was a robot response telling me the number was no longer in service. Oh well.

Update: I found some blue dust around the base of my phone. I have no clue what it could be. Any ideas?

Update: I left my phone on the table next to a slice of buttered bread on a plate while I went to the bathroom. (yes I washed my hands) When I came back there was a noticeable amount of the bread missing as well as crumbs between the plate and my phone.

Update: Today I left my phone on the charger while I went to shower. When I walked into the room I saw a small circular head peaking on the side of my phone. It was red and with yellow eyes that were closer to the sides of its head than they were to each other. It was no larger than my pinky but I know I saw it.

Update: Typing this on my computer. I put my phone in a jar with some salt and rat poison. I don't care what happens to it now. I have backups of the pictures on my computer. I'll just get a new phone when I have more money. Last time I buy a phone from tracfone. Not sure if I should bury the jar or toss it in the ocean. Maybe just burn the phone? Idk.
