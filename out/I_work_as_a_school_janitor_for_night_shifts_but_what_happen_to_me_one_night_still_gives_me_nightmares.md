I work at Holt and Rinehart middle school. It's a chill school in the daytime. Every day is the same for me; when all the kids leave school, I start to clean around the hallways and the classrooms, but one night, everything changed. I was doing the regular cleaning of the classrooms, but there was a small of something that I could not put my hand on. It seemed like something was dead; I could feel it inside me. But I still cleaned since I get paid per hour, but not even an hour later, I could hear the teachers talking about the kids, which is common, but this time it was different. They were saying

" You saw the new kid. He looks like a freak." Said the math teacher.

"Yeah, I saw him. He looks like he just died inside. I tried to talk to him, but he just looked at me and said nothing back, and it seemed like he did not even have eyes; they just seemed so dead to me."  Said the other teacher.

They were only talking about him, not planning or doing anything else. I thought it was weird, but I could judge others, so I continued my job. I went to the last hall I had to clean, then I only got to clean the lunchroom, but out of nowhere, I started to hear kids talking even tho all the kids had left the building. I could not listen to what they discussed, but they spoke of something. I started to go to the kids' voices, but it just stopped like no one or something was even talking. I began to walk back to the hallway I was cleaning, and after an hour of cleaning it since kids trashed this hall. I was going to tell the principal that I was cleaning the trash hallway, but for some reason, her voice came on the speaker for the whole school she said.

" If anyone is still in this building by 7:49, if you are still here by this time, your next paycheck will be 400$ off," she said.

But I still don't know why she made this announcement even though the only people still here are me and some of the teachers. But still, I was going to say I would go overtime for free because I like cleaning and have nothing to do at home. I still had 23 minutes to make it to clean the lunch area. When I got to the lunch area, I started to clean the tables, and it was calming just because it was only me cleaning it; most of the time, I would have my friends Bradley and Winston, but they had to be out because they both were sick. But after 10 minutes of this, I noticed that the lights started to turn off one by one. I did not know what to do, so I stayed; plus, I was on the third last table, so this will only take 2 minutes. But only if I listened to my gut and left that place, but I stayed; for the next few minutes, I started to hear more kids. I even tried to call out for one of the kids.

"HELLO, IS ANYONE THERE'' I said out loud because they kept talking non-stop.

But before I noticed all the lights were out and the kids stopped talking, I started to panic because I could not say anything or anyone, and I looked at my clock. It said 7:49, *"oh shit." I said to myself, then I started to run for the exit because I didn't want to get a paid cut, but I was too late, and the doors were locked. I don't know why my keys won't work on the exit door, but they won't, so I tried calling the principal, but she did not answer. I went to one of the classrooms to think, what the hell just happened. When I got into the classroom, I sat on the teacher's chair and started to consider for the next few minutes. But then I remembered I still had my phone with me, so I called most of the teachers that I knew if they were in this school too. All the calls went like this,*

*" Hello, are you in the school building I'm stuck in? I wanted to know if anyone else was in here, too,".* 

*All of them said no. But then, when I tried to think of what to do, I heard a sound that would never leave me. It was like a call of duty zombie, but the only difference is that this is real life and not a game. I peeked out the classroom door and saw it; the head was like nothing I had ever seen. It was red, and the hair was all black, but I think it knew I was looking at it because It started looking at me with a smile. I could not even see the body but only the head. But when the monster smiled, I got myself back into the classroom. When that monster saw me returning to the school, it dashed to it, and the glass part of the door he was looking back at me with the same smile. When the monster left me alone, I peeked outside the classroom again to see where the nightmare was going. It was going away for me, so I ran out of the classroom to break down a window and call for help. When I got to a window, I broke it down with just my legs and feet, which made a loud sound echoing throughout the school. The nightmare, which is the monster, was running to my location, so before anything, I jumped out the window and called for help.*

"CAN ANYONE HELP ME? HELLO?" I said as loud as I could when I left that god-awful school.

When I made it back home, I was out of breath. I saw nothing outside my window, just cars and some houses. I felt safe in my home, so I went upstairs and slept. The following day I called the principal and told her I had quit, and she couldn't do anything about it.

"PS this is my first story so tell me how good this"
