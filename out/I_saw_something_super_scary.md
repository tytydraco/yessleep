Call me Greg. Call me, Greg. Hah! See what I did there?



Yeah, I know, I’m a genius. So much so that, in my spare time, I sneak onto other subreddits I’m not the moderator of and give people answers, using only a fraction of my brain power on some Shaggy type shit. It’s light work. They should pay me for this. Unfortunately, they don’t. But! This one time—a time I remember as clear as artificial sunlight—someone gifted me an award and, get this, they said I won the internet! Their exact words were “You, sir, have won the internet. I tip my fedora to thee.” I orgasm-ed on the spot.



My genius and accomplishments, however, are not why I’m here. I’m here because I saw something. Saw something last night, to be specific. Saw something scary, to be even more specific. I had to put my moderating on pause to type this. And even went outside, for once, to pick up a DoorDash I ordered, which consisted of lots of Monster energy drinks. Hopefully I don’t punch any drywall while writing this because… this story… this story is really something. It cost me more sleep than when one of my discord kittens asked me to stay up and be her knight in shining armor because she was going through a rough patch with her boyfriend at the time (who was a prick btw). Why do good girls always prefer the bad boys? I’ve had that question for a long time. I’m, like, the nicest guy ever and no one wants to give me a chance. Us nice dudes, we always finish last. Sighhh, I guess I should’ve known better...



…But, uhh, anyway, where was I… Right! The story. It all started once upon a time. To be exact, said ‘time’ I’m uponing upon was around midnight—last night, not this night, this night I’m writing this, this which you are reading—while I was on voice call with one of my homies. We were chatting about the usual, you know, stuff like *“Hey, have you seen Andrew Tate's new guru video? Maybe if we follow it we won’t finish last”* and *“Dude, take that back. Star Wars is so not better than Rick and Morty”*



But, as we were deep into one of these discussions, the discord joining sound dinged. It silenced us immediately. And I may or may not have been shivering my timbers. 



The reason it got that reaction out of me was because we were in a private voice call. No one could have joined. Unless my homie, Pete, added someone, but that was extremely unlikely since he always preferred to stay in the shadows and remain silent, given that he had a lisp and all.



“Uhh…” I managed. “Uh… Pete?”



“G-Greg?” 



“Was that you?”



“It wa*sss* not.”



“Uh-oh…” I gulped, and, hesitantly, reached over to my mouse on its anime boob mouse pad; an action I had never hesitated on doing.



I closed out of the Reddit tab I had open, bringing me back to the discord tab. Once there, I saw… nothing. It was just me and Pete with his alpha wolf avatar in the call.



“Ha! Gotcha good!” Pete erupted in laughter.   
  


“Nani?” I asked. Could it have been a soundboard? But… but it sounded so real! I placed my hand over my face, wearing an anime protagonist smirk. “And there we go. The obvious answer that I have known. You’ve proven me right.” A chuckle escaped my lips. “Ah. Look at you. Thinking you have all the power in the world, thinking you can trick me. I have fallen for your illusion. How disappointing. I will say this, however. Fool me once, Pete, shame on me. But!”



“Don’t worry, I won’t fool ya twice. I gotta get going anyway. It’*sss* getting *sss*uper late.”



*Damn it, I was getting in the groove,* I thought. Villain monologues had nothing on the speech I just gave. “Alright, alright. I won’t hold you up. Have a good night, Pete!”



“You as well!” With that, he left the discord call. And I was about to leave as well but…



…before I get to that dramatic twist, I gotta go pee real quick. My bladder has been nagging me all the while I was typing that. In the words of my idol Joe Rogan: Monsters are piss magnets. Don’t worry though, I’ll take you guys with me, since I am after all typing this on my laptop. I’ll just continue typing on the way there.



I am currently getting up off of my sweat-stained gaming chair. There’s a maze of dirty clothes littering the floor that I’m navigating through to get to my front door. Hold on. I need my hands to open the door, so I’ll just set yall down real quick.



Alright. Done. The door’s now open, making the darkness from my hallway cower back thanks to the bright led strip lights of my room. I’m creeping forward, which is funny because I just so happen to be wearing a Minecraft Creeper hoodie. Hah! My floorboards seem to find it funny as well, given they are creaking and cackling.



Note to self: you are a genius. Note to those reading, watching, or listening via annoying AI narrations, you guys are awesome. Maybe not those listening to the AI narrations because fuck those channels. Thanks. Thanks for everything. Thanks to everyone besides AI of course. A specific thanks to you guys for validating my existence. I revolve my entire self-worth around how many upvotes I get. My posts about going outside and interacting with the world were worth a lot of upvotes. Guess Redditors dream of that. My self-deprecating humor posts and comments were worth a little less. My childhood trauma was worth only a few upvotes. Seems everyone has that nowadays.



But anyway, sorry for getting heartfelt there, I just… I just saw something that made me realize life is short, ya know?



I have arrived at the bathroom, having walked down the whole hallway. I’m putting y’all down while I pee.



Okay, I just finished cooking fried chicken in that toilet, just going back to my room now, currently passing the hallway split leading to the kitchen, now passing my roommates, now passing the dead body still lying in a pool of blood, and finally passing the threshold of my door, alrighty, let’s get back to the story…



…And I was about to leave as well, but Pete joined once again. Must’ve forgotten to tell me something, or so I assumed. 



I put my headset back on, the headband slotting seamlessly into the gamer dent on my calvaria. “What’s up?”



Pete stayed silent. For some odd reason. He was usually as much of a yapper as I am. *Weird.* There was a faint buzz of an AC audible in the background, so he definitely wasn’t muted. *Even more weird.* He probably accidentally joined while he went about doing whatever it was Pete did for his nightly routine; maybe doom scroll or something. 



Hence why I just decided to leave. If anything, he could always text me or holla. Plus, I was getting pretty tired myself and there were servers and subreddits to run come next morning. *Time to hit the hay.* 



I rose up off my gaming chair with a sigh and a scratch to my behind, then powered off my gaming laptop. That bad boy was my everything. My only connection to society. I’d fight to the death over it… okay maybe not, but it meant alot to me. So when I turned around and realized someone had broken into my house, my first instinct was to hide it. I placed that bad boy under my desk, grabbed my Xbox controller, and spun around in that ‘standoff with a six-shooter’ pose.



My window was wide open. Cold air I would’ve only otherwise felt when opening a refrigerator gusted in, fluttering my blackout curtains with an artificial sound of thunder. I never, and I mean never, opened that window. Ever. The most obvious reason being that I hated sunlight. But the less obvious reason was the fact that it was welded shut. Hence why I knew someone, or something, had broken in. You may be thinking: who the fuck would break in this late, also you are pretty awesome Greg, and also times 2, be careful! I know right? I was over here quivering. 



Glancing around my room, I spotted nothing out of the ordinary though. My bed still sat in the corner, unmade. Clothes and empty cans/wrappers still littered the floor. And my closet was still boarded shut like a window in COD Zombies. So whoever or whatever had broken in slipped right out of my room while I was on my laptop. Odd I didn’t see anything in the corner of my eye though, given that my gaming setup flanked the door. They must’ve snuck past during our VR session of the call then. That was the only explanation that made sense.



Speaking of which, I did the only thing that made sense to do when in situations like this: I called the police. But as I was dialing in 9-1-1, a shadow darted past in my periphery. I recoiled, surprised I didn't accidentally astrally project out of my body like Bruce Banner. I wasn't, however, surprised that I dropped my phone. I do have butter fingers after all. The phone’s fall was cushioned by carpet.



“Jesus!” I yelled, eyes darting about. It was definitely a humanoid shadow. I knew that much. And it was tall. At least seven feet, given that I am totally six feet. Okay, maybe it was six five or so, but that didn’t matter now. What mattered was my phone.



I looked down at my feet and thanked god. Didn’t thank god because of my feet, no, I thanked god because the call went through! 9-1-1 had picked up too, and they were surely pulling up my addy as we spoke. I squatted down to pick up my phone. But some dirty grimy hooves kicked it away just as I was doing so. I yelled like a girl, to say the least. To say the most, I may have spontaneously pissed myself. I looked up at… nothing. There was literally nothing there. Either the creature ran away at the speed of light or they dematerialized. Both explanations equally made me shit enough bricks to lay a house with the productivity of an Amish.



“Get out of my house! You don’t belong here!”



I could’ve sworn I heard a record abruptly scratch. Some dude dressed in a furry costume peeked its head into my window. “What you mean by that?”



“What do you mean what do I mean??”



“What do you mean by that which you have said about me not belonging?” The furry creature removed the head of its costume, revealing a… a Mexican.



“Oh… oh shit, man, sorry I, uh, I didn’t know. But just so *you* know, I voted for Kamala man, fuck Trump.”



…By the way, now should be the time for me to chime in and do some damage control: I am Mexican. Me, Greg. The Greg who said “Call me, Greg.” Hah! Gotcha again! Alright, uh, anyway, where was I? Right!…



He just stared at me, still shaking his head.



“Uhh…” I looked left and right. “Anywho… who are you? And why did you break into my house?”



“Pete hired me to give you a spook.” He pointed behind me with a furry finger. Bro was really wearing an anthropomorphic wolf costume. I turned around and found he was pointing at my now turned on gaming laptop. Not just that, it was on turned and in a video call with Pete’s DaddyLongNeck looking ass. He had his hands steepled, laughing his lungs off. 



He unmuted himself and said: “You *sss*hould’ve *sss*een the look on your face!”



“How could’ve I done that?” 



“A mirror, duhhh.”



“Oh, true.” I looked at the mirror on my wall. Holy shit, I was cooked. My hair was a bird’s nest. There was so much sweat on my pants and shirt it looked as if I had peed my pants. Oh wait, I had. But uh… that’s besides the point.



“Pete. Seriously dude. Why would you do this?”



“Because you wanted to *sss*ee the look on your face!” He was cackling Mr Krabs style.



“No, I mean, why would you prank me dude? Let alone hire a furry to do so?”



“Ah. Because you *sss*ee, Greg, this is retaliation for pranking me all tho*sss*e year*sss* ago.” He looked up at the sky; I did as well. And a flashback sequence soon ensued. “Remember back in highschool, when you gave me a wedgie in front of all tho*sss*e girls?”



“Dude, that was, like, five years ago.”



“Five year*sss*, three month*sss*, two hour*sss*, four—rather, five now—minute*sss*, three second*sss*, and nine millisecond*sss* ago. And I have yet to forget the embarra*sss*ment you put me through.”



“Woah.” I snapped out of the flashback sequence. “Sorry about that man.”



“Yeah, I know it was terri—wait… did you ju*sss*t apologi*zzz*e?”



“Yeah, that was pretty fucked up of me, sorry dude.”



“Oh… I, uh, I wasn’t expecting that.” He cleared a lump in his throat. “Damn, thanks, that really means a lot.”



“Yeah, no problem, man. Want a hug?”



“Yeah… Yeah I would love that.”



He disappeared out of view in the video call, and soon after burst into my room Fanum Tax style. We hugged; complete with pats on the back and all, including some sobs as well, you know, the whole vulnerability package.



“So… who’s gonna pay me?” asked the furry.



“Oh! True.” Pete sniffled then handed the furry a wad of cash that he should’ve been using to pay his share of the rent instead of using to prank me like a cunt.



…Hold on, I am currently hearing sniffling from over my shoulder. And a few drops of snot dripped down onto my sleeve.



“Pete?” I ask, while still typing my every move.



“Greg?”



“Why are you standing over my shoulder, man, I’m a little busy here.”



“Yeah, I could *sss*ee that. Bu*sss*y typing a ma*sss*terpiece.” He wipes his tears from his cheeks. “But, uh, *sss*orry, it’*sss* ju*sss*t that the *sss*mell is terrible from my room. Maybe we should… uh, di*sss*pose of the ‘tra*sss*h’” He air quotes



“I already did my chores this morning, dude, it’s your turn.”



“No, I mean, the tra*sss*h-tra*sss*h. You know, the ‘zombie pre-awakening’” Once again he air quotes.



“Zombie? Ahh!! Where?!” 



“No you fucking dumba*sss*, the dead body. The damn per*sss*on we killed last night.”



“Ohhhh… Hold on though, I gotta tell Reddit who we killed and how.”



“Dude, fuck Reddit, they can wait.”



“Okay, okay. But let me just end this story in a more satisfying way. Besides our bromance.”



Okay, so, yeah we killed someone. That someone wasn’t the furry prankster though, he’s cool actually. We ended up cracking open a few cold Modelos and pulled an all-nighter with him. After he had left for the night to go get his one hour of sleep before getting up to work, Pete and I ordered DoorDash. We ordered two of the same orders from different accounts like dumbasses since we were sat across from each other, on our phones, talking out loud about how hungry we were. And yeah. We accidentally killed one of two DoorDashers, because they happened to be standing next to the Halloween decor that we still had up for some odd reason. It spooked us. Spooked us to the point of compulsively swinging at them like a knee reflex test. And after we had killed one of them, we thought we had to intentionally kill the other because of what he witnessed, but apparently doordashers couldn’t care less. We just gave bro a hefty tip and he went on his merry way. Hopefully we don’t go to jail. And hopefully this story doesn’t get narrated by monotonous AI narrations because fuck those dudes.



Peace out Reddit! Thanks in advance for all the “you won the internet” comments.
