I clicked the recorder on. "Hello, Tommy, how're we doing today?" The boy made no motion. "Tommy?" I asked. He looked up at me. The look on his face was an almost confusing combination of anxiety and confusion.

"How was your day today?" He continued staring at me. I started shuffling the papers around to find his file. "Okay, not much of a talker, are you?" I chuckled. I exchanged a brief glance up at him. Still, he just sat there staring at me. For a second, I noticed how blank his face was, not just the look of confusion, but more of just this... this *lost* look in his eyes.

"Well, that's okay, you can talk to me in your own time. Just remember that I'm here to help you and I want you to know that you can tell me anything you want, okay? Anything. Even if you feel like it's something you wouldn't want your ma and pop knowing. I'm Dr. Randall, by the way."

Nothing. I started shuffling through the papers again until I found the documents I was looking for, the school incident reports. "Now Tommy, it says here you wrote things on the stall in the bathrooms, hurtful, scary things. Would you be willing to tell me about them?"

Nothing. Stares -- not even at me, I started to notice -- but *past* me. His body was there, in my office, but his mind couldn't have been farther. I was tempted to reach over and shake him, admittedly, just to see if the poor kid was even still *alive*. Instead, though, I looked back down to the documents and asked "Are the other kids at school mean to you?" When I looked back up at him, he was actually moving, rapidly blinking while shaking his head.

"Tommy?" I asked. The jerking of his head became more and more sporadic. Soon, it came to a point where he was squinting and his entire body was jerking. *Oh God, he's having a seizure!*

This caused me to spring to my feet and I was about to rush over to him when, all of a sudden, he just stopped. For a moment, I stood frozen myself, halfway convinced I just watched him die. Then, his head came back up and looked at me, blinking and looking around the office. "Tommy? Are you okay?"

"Y-Yeah, what's going on?" he asked. He sounded legitimately confused when he asked this.

"Do you know where you are, Tommy?" He shook his head. "Tommy, my name is Dr. Randall, I'm here to--"

"Doctor?" he interrupted, "But I'm not sick."

I chuckled nervously and replied, "Well, you know, Tommy, there are different types of Doctors. There's the ones like you're thinking that you go to when you're feeling sick. Then there's the ones you go to for when you need to get glasses. There's the ones you go to for when you need to talk about things going on in your head, too. I'm one of those doctors."

He cocked his head to the side. "In my head?"

"Uh-huh. Like how you feel, what you think about. Think about it this way, my job is to help you feel well on the *inside*."

"Kinda like when the pretty nurse lady gives me that nasty purple stuff to drink to make my tummy ache go away?" I chuckled again.

"Yeah, something like that." He giggled at this.

"Are you gonna make me drink some nasty purple stuff?" I shook my head, chuckling.

"See, Tommy, I have a different type of medicine. Mine is where we talk and see what's wrong in your head." He stopped smiling and tilted his head to the side.

"But there's nothing wrong with my head, Dr."

"There isn't?" I asked disbelievingly. "You sure?" He nodded slowly.

"Okay, well then let's just talk."

"O-Okay... What about?"

"Well, let's start with school. You like school?" He nodded. "You have a lot of friends?"

He shrugged. "Not really."

"How come?" He shrugged again. "Are the other kids mean to you?" He shook his head. "Really?" I asked.

"No."

"They don't call you any names or say hurtful things about you?"

"No."

"None at all? They don't call you ugly or stupid, anything like that? Maybe they say they don't want you around them?" This got a reaction out of him, causing him to lower his head like he was embarrassed. "Something wrong, Tommy? Do your classmates say that to you?"

"No." he said in a timid voice. I frowned at him. "They don't say that. They don't say anything."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, no one really says *anything* to me."

"No one says anything to you in the hallway?" He shook his head. "What about at lunch or recess?"

"Nuh-uh."

"Really? Not at all?" He shook his head. His eyes were big now and I could see tears starting to well up in them. I had to be careful how much farther I pushed him. "Why not?"

"I... I don't know." he whimpered. "They just don't ever wanna talk to me or play 'Army men' on the playground."

"I see, and how does that make you feel?" He shrugged, sniffling.

"I don't know. Sad, I guess."

"Makes you feel sad?" I repeated. He nodded. "I'll bet you get pretty lonely, don't you?" His head sank to look at the floor. "I'll bet you have one friend, though, don't you?"

For a moment, he looked up at me, before looking back down to the floor. "Do you, have a friend?"

"Well... There is Mr. Needle-nose." I furrowed my eyebrows at him.

"Mr. Needle-nose, huh?" I asked. "What's he like? Is *he* nice?" He nodded, shrugging. "Does Mr. Needle-nose like to play 'Army men' with you at recess?" He looked down again.

"Not really."

"Hmm... Well then what *do* you and Mr. Needle-nose like to do at recess?"

"He likes to tell me stories."

"Stories, eh? Like what?"

"Well, like spooky ones, like the kinds in those movies mommy and daddy say I'm too young to watch yet, you know?" I nodded.

"Do you like when he tells you these stories?" He shrugged.

"Sometimes. I used to think it was cool, you know, 'cause I wasn't supposed to listen to that kind of stuff. Mama calls it 'brain-rot', says it'll make my brain mushy." I smiled. This was admittedly adorable, despite also being a bit concerning overall. "But sometimes it would give me bad dreams."

"Really?"

"Uh-huh, like the one he told me about the little girl that was taken out of her bed one night and kidnapped and only her head was found." He curled up into a ball in his chair. His body quivered violently and tears streamed down his cheeks.

"Hey, hey, it's okay." I said warmly. "Listen, we don't have to talk about Mr. Needle-nose anymore right now, okay? We can talk about something different."

"O-Okay..." he whimpered.

"What would you like to talk about?" He shrugged his shoulders, sniffing. "How about home? Everything going okay there?" He nodded, limply shrugging his shoulders. "You do anything cool there?"

"Not really." he muttered.

"You sure, nothing at all?"

He looked up to the ceiling, frowning and tapping his finger on his chin before replying, "Well, I do sometimes like to build a fort in my room with my pillows and blankets."

"Neat. What's it for?"

"Hiding."

"From who?"

"Enemy soldiers, of course."

"Ahh... and does it work?"

"Usually."

"Do you usually win against the enemy troops with your fort?"

"Usually. But sometimes they end up overrunning us and we have to fall back." I grinned.

"But you always get 'em back, right?" He chuckled and nodded. *Good, he's coming back.*

"Can I ask you something, Tommy?" He leaned closer in his chair, eyes wide with attention. "Why do you like that game so much, 'Army men'?"

He shrugged. "I don't know, cause Army men are awesome."

"What makes you say so?"

"Well, 'cause they get to go around shooting guns and stuff and killing bad guys."

"I see. If you don't mind me asking, Tommy, who ARE these 'bad guys' you fight?"

He paused for a moment, tapping his finger on his chin again and said, "Well, it's different sometimes."

"Different 'bad guys', you mean?"

"Uh-huh."

"How so?"

"Well, sometimes they're big scary men in black uniforms."

"I see, and what makes them 'bad guys', per say?" He frowned. "In other words, why do you have to fight them? What do they do that makes them bad?"

"Well, they do mean things to people. Do things that hurt good people, you know?"

"Like what?"

"You know, like taking and hurting women or kidnapping little little boys and girls and never letting them see their mommies and daddies again." He was starting to tremble again.

"Hmm, and why do they do that?" He shrugged. "You don't know?" He shook his head. "How do you know they do this stuff then?"

"Because I see 'em do it."

"What do you mean?"

"I see the bad guys all the time, snatching little boys and girls and they never see their mommies and daddies again. No one else ever sees them again, either, so I have to fight them."

"Okay. So you always see them, you say?"

"Uh-huh."

"Where?"

"Everywhere. At least, anywhere with other kids."

"I see. Are there any in here, right now, in the office with us?" He didn't answer this. He just stared at me for a solid ten seconds before I called out his name, "Tommy?"

He snapped back to look at me. His eyes were confused again like they were at the beginning. "What happened, Dr. Randall?"

I frowned, raising my eyebrows. "Are you okay?" His eyes looked around the room, rotating his head around like he was lost. "Tommy, are you feeling okay?"

"What happened, where'd everything go?" he exclaimed, his voice shaking. He began to hyperventilate.

"Calm down, Tommy, it's okay. It's okay, nothing's wrong. What happened, did you see something?"

"I... I don't know. I saw you for a second, then everything was gone!"

"What do you mean "gone"?"

"Just gone. Everything was all black, I couldn't see you anymore."

"What *did* you see?" He looked back to me again. His eyes were bulging and glistening, his breath quivering. "Tommy, what's wrong, talk to me, what did you see?"

"It... It.. It was..." His hyperventilation increased. "It was Mr. Needle-nose!" His hyperventilation was then cut off as he began seizing. His entire body seemed to lock up and jerk as one unified convulsion.

"Tommy!" I yelled, jumping up from my chair to rush over to him. "Walter, call the ambulance, he's having a seizure!"

Foam began foaming from Tommy's mouth, first the usual white, saliva type, but then it was red and viscous. *Oh Jesus, he's choking on his own blood!* "Walter, damn it, *hurry!*"

"I'm on the phone with them now, sir." Walter shouted. "Yes sir, we have a minor, male, 7 years old, he's having a seizure." Tommy's body jerked harder and harder in my arms. Red fluid was now being coughed up in large spurts like a fountain from his mouth. Walter was heard running down the hall.

"Sir, they wanna talk to you-- oh my God!" His face was instantly drained of color. I stood up and took the phone from him.

"Here, Stay with him and hold his head up or he'll choke." I then walked into the lobby with the phone. "This is Dr. Randall, I'm the behavioral physician of Eastboro psychiatric care on Westman Rd. My patient is a little boy, Tommy Ryers, and he's having a severe seizure."

**"Okay, sir, now has the victim been exposed to any flashing lights?"**

"No ma'am."

**"Are you aware of any genetic pre-disposure of epilepsy?"**

"No ma'am, I have his records, medical ones too. He's had no history, direct or genetically, of epilepsy."

**"Okay, sir, now is the victim at all responsive?"**

"No ma'am, he's completely catatonic."

**"Are you aware of anything the victim might've eaten that could've triggered this condition?"**

"No ma'am."

**"Has the victim expelled any fluids from the mouth or rectum?"**

"Yes ma'am, he's releasing this red fluid from his mouth. I think he's choking on his own blood!"

**"You said it was a red fluid?"**

"Yes."

**"Okay, First responders are on their way. I want you to stay on the line with me until they--"**

My attention was jerked away from the phone when I felt Walter's hand on my shoulder. "Sir, you need to see this." His face was pale as a bedsheet.

"What happened?!"

"I... I... I don't know." Phone still clutched in my hand, I stormed down the hallway behind him back to the office. My heart froze dead at the entrance.

On the floor, covered in a pool of red fluid, Tommy's body laid motionless. His eyes were stitched wide, staring up at the ceiling, face frozen in perpetual terror. Time stopped right there and then. The world was drowned out around me, though, faintly, I could hear the dispatcher saying from the other end *"Hello, sir, are you still there?"*

"Tommy?!" I cried out. Nothing. "Tommy!" I rushed over to him, gently nudging him before pressing my index and middle fingers to his throat. There was nothing. Not even a faint pulse, just silence.

*Oh God... Oh God, Oh God, no, no, no, no, no, Jesus Christ, PLEASE no!*

I continued nudging his lifeless body. "Tommy! Tommy, come on, you gotta wake up! Tommy!" Nothing. Eventually, I'd say about a minute and half, two minutes later, I heard the sirens pulling into the parking lot outside. Walter let the paramedics in and I was led away from Tommy's body.

From there, everything went into a daze. My entire body was hollow. My mind was hollow. One thought and one thought only cycled repeatedly in my mind.

*He's dead! He just died right in front of me, in my office!*

Tommy's body was wheeled out soon after the police arrived. "I... I don't know what happened." I stammered to the officer. "Everything was just fine before he began seizing like that."

"There were no flashing lights?"

"No sir, I told the operator that and I already said that he never had any real history of epilepsy."

"Alright, well can you tell me what led up to this?"

"I already have. We were just talking."

"And were there any signs beforehand that things were going sideways?"

"There were, but sir, that's just it, I actually changed the conversation, but..." I trailed off. He raised his eyebrow, wanting me to continue, but I couldn't. What more would I be able to say? Even if I could violate HIPPA, it still wouldn't have provided any real light on the subject.

"Have the boy's parents been notified?" asked another officer. I turned to Walter who nodded and started dialing on his phone. The officer interrogating me thrusted a card into my chest and told me to keep in touch before turning and joining the others. I stood alone then, a lifeless, borderline mindless statue in the parking lot. My eyes absently rolled to look at the ambulance. They had just heaved the gurney into the back of the truck before closing the doors. They peeled out of the parking lot after that, with the police following soon after.

Then everything went quiet. My attention was snapped to Walter when he came over to me, telling me Tommy's parents had been called and that they were headed to the hospital. I nodded and looked away again. I was about to trudge to my car when he put his hand on my shoulder and said, "This wasn't your fault, Bill." I didn't answer this, though if I had, it'd have only been to tell him that that was no comfort anyway.

I knew it wasn't my fault. That was the problem. It wasn't my fault, but then, who or what *was* to blame?

*Mr. Needle-nose...*

This then started to join the confusing frenzy that was my brain. What in God's name was "Mr. Needle-nose"?

Obviously, my first impression was that it was an imaginary friend, one that was perhaps developing into a sort of dissociative identity disorder. I'd had cases before of patients, particularly young children, blaming things on mischievous imaginary friends. That's just natural, right? Mommy asks who broke the plate and little Johnny whatever says "No mom, that wasn't me, it was 'Mr. Fuzzy' over there, see?"

The child may or may not believe he or she actually exists, but everyone else knows *they* were the ones that broke the plate or whatever. Usually, too, the child isn't afraid of the imaginary friend either. They'll either "Tell them to stop" or to "Go away", but this was different. Tommy was *afraid* of "Mr. Needle-nose", so much it killed him. But then, was that it? Was it sheer fright alone that killed him? Of course, if that *were* the case, why, and how would that explain the other odd behaviors; the stillness and disconnects from reality and such?

These were questions I had no mind to try answering then. Who or whatever the cause, a child had just died in my office and there wasn't a damn thing I or anyone else could've done to stop it. I went home that night in a daze and you can bet every penny to your name I didn't get a damn bit of sleep. The next morning, I woke to an email from the Board of Administration "recommending" that I take a week or two off, unpaid leave, while the heat from the situation blows over. Almost like clockwork, too, I then turned on the news and the first headline that greets me is **"Child dies under mysterious circumstances while in psychiatric care. Parents suing specialists."**

"Just yesterday afternoon, authorities were alerted to the scene of *Parker's Care Behavioral and Psychotherapeutics center,* where just an hour before, Harold and Yolanda Pitcher had brought their son, Tommy, for consultation. When they arrived, the boy was said to have suffered a panic induced seizure. It is unclear at this time whether or not the Therapist in charge of the consultation was involved with the boy's death, however, it has been stated that the parents of young Tommy Pitcher are looking to take the matter to court on grounds of malpractice."

*MALPRACTICE!* I screamed internally. The footage then cuts to Yolanda Pitcher herself.

"If you're watching this, and I hope you are, then I hope you're happy with yourself. My little boy's gone. I don't care what you told the cops, and I know you probably won't see any jail time, but I know it was your fault. We entrusted our boy to you, and whatever *YOU* did, took him away from us for good. I hope you're happy now."

The words were a serrated knife, cutting through my guts and ripping my heart straight in half. I wanted to scream, to her, the Board and to the world that I didn't kill him, but then, what was the use? Like I said, how could I be sure at the time that it *wasn't* overwhelming fright that'd killed him? If nothing else, too, she had at least *one* grave point. They HAD trusted me with his care while he was under my supervision. Regardless of whether or not the cause of the situation could be explained, regardless of whether or not it could be proven that I hadn't been complacent in his death, the fact still remained. For that alone, I went the next week almost completely without sleep.

Eventually, the heat indeed blew over and the case was settled. Fortunately, it was resolved that my actions were not the cause of Tommy's death, nor were the actions of the others complacent. The Pitchers didn't win the case and *Parker's Care Behavioral and Psychotherapeutics center* managed to get away without shelling out a dime. Obviously, there was a small media uproar about this but it, too, subsided. What *didn't* subside was the overwhelming dread I still felt over the whole situation.

Responsible or not, without knowing exactly *what* caused his sudden condition, I *still* had no idea whether or not this was a mere isolated incident or if there was a chance of it happening again. What would I do then?

A few weeks went by then, more or less without much of a hitch. Granted, a few of the long-time clients of *Parker's Care* had stopped coming, thanks to the incident. For the most part, though, everyone else more or less "had my back", so to speak (plus it's worth mentioning that, since I wasn't ever mentioned by name in the news coverage, not even by Yolanda Pitcher herself, *technically,* I still held a degree of plausible deniability.)

It was a good few days, though, before I was able to get back into the swing of things at the office. If it weren't for the need for as much of the full amount of my next paycheck as possible, I probably would've just taken a few more days off. Still, by the end of that first week back, I was *somewhat* back to working order. As much as could be expected, anyways. I'd even managed to shove even the mention of [Mr. Needle-nose](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zn3q18/the_haunting_case_of_mr_needlenose_gina/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to the farthest reaches of my brain.
