You know, in this day and age, everything has its own society, community, or forum—whether offline or online. Even the strange and nonsensical ones.

Have you ever heard about a bunch of kids taking pictures with DSLR lens caps? Yeah, very specific—the lens caps. That falls into the "doesn't-make-sense" category for me, and yet, it has its own societies and communities in different cities.

Welcome to millennial! Yay!

Now, if you think about it, it wouldn't be odd to find that almost everything else has its own society, community, or forum.

Take liars, for example.

Yeah, liars—people who tell lies. They have their own society too. I mean, why not? Especially when you're in the habit of lying, constantly telling lies, and want a safe space to do it without hurting your family or loved ones. It’s much easier to lie to a group of people who already know you’re lying than to deceive the people who truly matter to you.

I was once a part of this Society of Liars.

Once.

Like any other society, the Society of Liars I’m talking about had a name. It was called Liar’s Dinner, because it was held once a week at night, where we shared lies over dinner and snacks. Pretty much like any other gathering, except for one key rule: everything we said was a lie. Every single thing.

And all the members of the gathering must react and respond as if the story is real, no matter how badly the lies are told by other members.

There are many reasons why people tell lies.

The most common is to avoid trouble—truth gets you into trouble, so you lie. Others lie because they’re manipulators; they enjoy controlling situations and people. But the most fascinating liars, in my opinion, are the dreamers—the ones who wish they could do something they never could, so they lie about it. They lie about being great at something, just to feel the thrill of admiration. It gives them the same satisfaction as a successful person bragging about their achievements.

The difference is, it’s all a lie.

When people believe them, they feel like their worth skyrockets—like they’ve ascended to a higher level of respect or quality.

But in reality, they haven’t.

As seasoned liars, most of us could spot the difference between truth and lies, no matter how well-disguised. Some lies are obvious, even to a child.

Take Danny, for example—a short, chubby, awkward guy and a terrible liar. His lies were so bad, they were almost entertaining. He’d spin the same stories over and over, about robbing banks or hooking up with supermodels. You didn’t need a Ph.D. in psychology to know he was lying.

Then there are lies that only experts can debunk. Like if someone claims to have robbed a bank but gets the details wrong, someone with experience would catch it immediately.

A lie is a lie—it didn’t happen. And if you’ve lived with lies long enough, you can always tell the difference.

But have I ever met someone who told a lie so convincing that it sounded like the truth? A story where every detail matched, down to the tiniest nuance?

Yes, I have.

Do I think they were lying or telling the truth?

Well, you tell me.

It was the 57th Liar’s Dinner gathering. Only seven out of 24 members showed up—it was a cold and rainy night.

One of the Society of Liars’ core rules was anonymity. No one knew anyone’s real identity. We all used fake names, and no personal details were shared when we joined. The only things we knew about each other were our faces, fake names, and the lies we told.

My name in the society was Lucas—Luke for short.

I ran from the parking lot to the building to avoid the rain, knocked on the door, and was greeted by Max.

“Yo, Luke! Our Liar of the Month is here!” Max exclaimed, grinning. “How’s your day, mate?”

“Terrible, as always. Everything went horribly wrong today,” I replied, stepping inside. In the Liar’s Dinner, the moment you entered the room, everything you said had to be a lie.

“Wow, that’s sad,” Max said with a chuckle, handing me a cup of warm coffee.

The others—Danny, Lionel, Neil, and Randall—were already there. Shortly after, Nicholas arrived, making it seven of us.

Max started the meeting, and we all took turns telling our lies. Danny kicked things off with his usual nonsense—crime sprees and supermodels. Predictable. Lionel tried something new, claiming he’d hooked up with a famous actress. Close, but the details didn’t quite add up. Neil and Randall teamed up, boasting about launching a startup that became wildly successful in just three months. Too good to be true.

Finally, it was Nicholas’ turn. Usually, he’d launch straight into tales of glamour and luxury. But that night was different.

He sat there, scanning the room, a strange smile on his face.

“Well,” he began, “this week, I experienced something I’ve never experienced before. Something extreme.”

He paused, letting the silence build.

“I murdered someone.”

The room fell silent, everyone staring at him in disbelief.

Throughout 57 meetups with 24 members, no one ever told a story—or a lie—about murdering someone. Some members did share stories about doing horrible things to people they hated, like their bosses or their bullies, but never a murder.

"Wow! This is new!" Max exclaimed from the back, as excited as ever, clapping his hands slowly. "Go on!"

"It actually happened three days ago," Nicky began his story. "The day started out like every other day. I woke up in the morning, had breakfast, and kissed my wife goodbye before heading to work." Unlike the way he had opened his session earlier, his voice softened as he started his story.

"So, I did my job as best as I could at the office, just like I always do. However, unlike every other day, it turned out to be the worst day ever. That morning, I had a meeting with a potential investor for the company I work for. I’ve never had a problem dealing with third parties before—whether they were future clients or investors—but this one guy I met that morning was really tough. He asked me questions, and I answered, but no matter what I said, he always had a counterargument. It was as if everything I said was wrong.

"You know, it wasn’t the first time I talked to potential investors. I’ve been doing this for years. Most of the questions they ask are predictable, and I know the answers by heart. So, I started to think that this guy was intentionally giving me a hard time.

"And I didn’t know why.

"Long story short, the deal fell through. It was a complete failure. My boss had warned me beforehand that this deal was huge, so if I failed, I’d be in trouble.

"And I was.

"When I got back to the office, I had to endure the full wrath of my boss. My day was officially ruined. And it didn’t stop there—it got worse. Just as my boss was done yelling at me, he reminded me of another meeting in the afternoon. That’s when I realized I’d forgotten to bring the files he needed for the meeting.

"I couldn’t afford more trouble, so I sneaked out of the office and drove home. My plan was simple: grab the files and get back before my boss noticed I was gone.

"But when I got home, I heard noises coming from my bedroom. It was my wife, moaning with pleasure. I walked toward the doorway. It wasn’t closed, so I could see everything clearly—my wife in the middle of having sex with another man.

"I didn’t know who he was because, from the doorway, I only saw his back.

"Of course, I did what any husband would do in that situation. I shoved the door open and yelled at them. I startled the guy because he quickly turned around.

"That’s when my rage boiled over.

"I finally saw the man’s face, and at first, I thought he was a stranger. But I was wrong. I had met him before—just that morning during the investor meeting.

"The man in bed with my wife was the same man who had sabotaged the deal earlier that day. The potential investor.

"'WHAT THE FUCK? WHY ARE YOU HERE, HUH?' I shouted at him as he scrambled to get off the bed. 'You ruined the deal this morning, got me in trouble with my boss, and now you’re screwing my wife? You son of a bitch!'

"'Soon-to-be-ex-wife!' he shot back. 'Stop acting like you're so great! You're good at nothing!'

"'You’re in my house, goddammit!' I screamed, enraged. 'Don’t act like you own the place!' I ran at him and swung my fist.

"Before I knew it, we were fighting. My wife just sat on the bed, frozen, unsure of what to do.

"During the fight, I managed to grab something from the desk—a metallic statue—and I swung it at him. BAM! I hit his head hard. Blood gushed out, and he collapsed. He wasn’t moving. My wife screamed in horror at the sight.

"My house is pretty big, and the distance between houses in my neighborhood is considerable, so no one would have heard us yelling. But my wife’s scream? That would definitely alert the neighbors. Before she could scream again, I turned around and hurled the metallic statue at her.

"I didn’t aim for her head, but that’s where it landed. She suffered the same fate as her lover—dead from massive blood loss.

"I knew I couldn’t afford to get caught, so I thought fast.

"First, I had to avoid arousing suspicion at work or among my neighbors. I locked the house and rushed back to the office.

"I wrapped up everything I needed to do at work and then returned home in the evening. Once home, I cleaned up the mess. I burned all the clothes and fabrics stained with blood. I scrubbed every trace of blood from the floor and walls. Then, I mutilated their bodies, packed them into a large bag, and waited until after midnight.

"When the neighborhood was silent, I loaded the bag into my car and drove to my late grandparents’ old house on the outskirts of town. Behind their house, there’s a pier that leads to a deep, murky lake. I found the biggest drum in their barn, stuffed the bodies inside, and sealed it with cement.

"Finally, I rolled the drum onto the pier and let it plunge into the lake’s depths.

"I returned home by 4 a.m., just before the neighborhood woke up. Exhausted, I collapsed onto my freshly cleaned bed and fell asleep almost immediately."

Nicky paused, taking a deep breath, and looked around the room at each of us.

"Well, that’s all," he said, spreading his arms wide and smiling ear to ear.

No one reacted. The room was silent. We all sat there, staring at Nicky, each of us silently asking the same question.

This was Liars’ Dinner, a gathering where everyone shared lies. Nicky’s story, like everyone else’s, should have been a lie. But when I glanced at the other members, their faces told me they were thinking the same thing as I was.

Nicky’s story sounded too realistic. Way too realistic. Every detail seemed perfectly placed.

I’d known Nicky since the society's inception. I’d heard every lie he’d ever told, and there were always flaws—details that didn’t add up. But not this time.

I mean, this was a murder, man! A murder! You don’t just make something like that up without cracks in the story. It’s too big, too haunting to be flawless.

Before anyone could react, Nicky stood up, glanced at his watch, and said, "I’m deeply sorry, guys. It’s been fun, but I have to go now." He grabbed his coat and headed for the door.

"What? Right now? Come on, Nicky, we're not done yet," Max tried to keep him in the room.

"Sorry, Max. There's a plane I need to catch," Nicky replied.

"A plane? Where are you going?" Leo asked.

"Manila, Philippines," Nicky responded calmly. "Business trip, for about two weeks. I won’t see you guys for two weeks. Gotta say, that's pretty sad." Nicky giggled as he explained.

Nicky walked toward the door, with Max following behind.

"See ya, guys," he waved at us in the room without even looking back.

Max closed the door and locked it. He then turned around and leaned his back against the door. Everyone in the room remained silent as Max stared at each of us.

"The story Nicky just told us," Max spoke slowly, his voice soft, "was a lie..." He paused for a moment before continuing with a question.

"...Right?"

Everyone in the room exchanged uneasy glances.

"Well, this is a Liars' society. Rule number one is that everything we say in the room should be a lie," Neil answered. But before he could finish, Max cut him off.

"I wasn't asking about the society or the rules," Max said. "I was asking your opinion about Nicky's story."

"I don’t know, Max. Seriously. I'm not a good liar," Randy said. "But Nicky's story was too convincing. I felt like I was drawn to it."

"Okay, this is breaking the rules we set for ourselves," Danny finally spoke. "We’re not supposed to discuss whether the other members' stories are truth or lies."

"Yeah, but we’ve never heard a lie this good in the society before. And it’s Nicky we’re talking about. Even I always noticed some details that were off in his stories," Randy commented. "Also, we all agreed that there’s no such thing as a perfect liar."

"Well, yeah. But rules are rules, Randy," Danny replied.

"Okay, okay. Danny’s right," Max said again. "But one more question..." He remained leaning on the door.

"Who else here thinks that Nicky isn’t actually coming back?"

No one raised their hand, but from the looks in their eyes, I was sure everyone had the same answer to that question. And for the next thirty minutes, we sat in silence, each lost in our thoughts, pondering the thing we weren’t supposed to discuss.

After the rain and wind stopped, one by one, everyone got up from their seats and walked toward the door. We left without saying a word, but we all had the same thoughts lingering in our minds.

Two days after the gathering, I stopped by a coffee shop near my house after work. Just as I was about to pull out a chair, I heard a familiar voice.

"Lucas," the voice said slowly, "or whatever your real name is."

I turned to see Maxwell—if that was even his real name—sitting at a table next to the one I was about to sit at. Max gestured for me to join him, so I sat across from him.

After a few moments of silence, I couldn’t hold back anymore.

"Okay. This isn’t the society’s room, so I can ask whatever I want," I said, trying to keep my voice low. "Nicky's story was a lie, right?"

"I don’t know, but..." Max replied immediately, "what if we ask the question differently?"

"Say he actually killed his wife and her lover," Max began. "Why would he tell us about it? All of us. Six people. We could be witnesses to his confession."

Max had a point, and I was about to agree when another thought flashed through my mind.

"You know, if he wasn’t a serial killer and only killed them unintentionally, wouldn’t the murder haunt him? I read a few articles about that," I said.

"Yeah, I know. So?" Max responded.

"So, the only way to ease the burden and haunting thoughts is by sharing the story with someone," I explained.

"Typically a friend or a psychiatrist, sure. But six people? That doesn’t make sense," Max said.

"Exactly. But think about this—have you seen any news about murders matching Nicky’s story?" I asked. Max froze for a moment before responding.

"I haven’t," he admitted. "I’ve been looking but found nothing."

"Exactly. And don’t forget he shared the story in the Society of Liars, where everything is supposed to be a lie," I continued. "That’s the rule, but who’s to say some parts weren’t true? Maybe he just added twists and changes to make it seem like a lie."

"No one can prove if Nicky even has a wife or a job," Max added, his excitement growing.

"Or a house," I said.

"Maybe..." I said, "maybe he did murder someone. Or two. Or three. Who knows?" I paused. "But it’s clearly not his wife and her lover."

"It’s possible he mutilated someone, packed them in a drum, but didn’t throw them into his grandparents’ lake," Max suggested. "Maybe he dumped them in the sea. Or burned them."

"That’s smart," Max said, leaning back in his chair. "Even if we watched the news, we’d never figure it out."

"Because we don’t know which parts were true and which were lies," I added.

"You think everyone else has figured this out too?" Max asked.

"Even if they haven’t yet, they eventually will," I replied. "If we can, so can they. And the six of us from that night can tell the story to others who weren’t there."

"Will it impact the society?" I asked.

Max stared at the ceiling for a moment before answering. "Yes," he said. "And the worst-case scenario..." He paused. "Everyone might find the game useful and start using it themselves."

"You mean the other members might murder someone they hate and retell their stories to ease their burden too?" I asked, not even surprised anymore.

"Yep. And that, Luke," Max said, pointing at himself, "includes me..."

Then he pointed his finger at me.

"...And you."
