“Oh, fuck. Matty’s gone-,” I stress-talked at Jen while I stress-ate a handful of chocolate-covered espresso beans a friend of mine had recently sent me from Guatemala.

I had awoken this morning to day number three of the brand new, non-caffeinated me. Looked like the end of the line for that peace train. I wasn’t sure I cared anymore.

“Slow. Down. David,” Jen said. “Where is my husband?”

“You sound like the chick in The Incredible Hulk,” I said.

“I just got off the F train,” Jen said ignoring my Marvel reference. “I’m coming right over and I’m bringing coffee, David. And chocolate. I just got another fucking 40% off up to $15 promotion. Fucking AI! You hear me, AI? Just fuck off and fuck you. By the way, tell Matty I said he should try answering his wife’s fucking messages for a change.”

Fifteen minutes later, my golden retriever, Archer, was whimpering his hello into Jen’s crotch like it was thundering outside or something. It was actually a sunny day without a cloud in the sky but it was grayer then the first scene of The Wizard of Oz in my heart. Jen told Archer what a good boy he was. Enabler.

I was modifying a couple of blonde roasts Jen had brought over along with a few bags of dark chocolate and sea salt covered almonds.

I was busy reheating the coffee. I didn’t like lukewarm coffee. I poured the coffees from their cups into my new Michelangelo sauce pot. I then added all the chocolate covered nuts and espresso beans. Then I turned up the heat.

Behind my back Jen said, “David. Where the fuck is Matty? People don’t just disappear. I mean Matty disappears sometimes, but not *disappears* disappears. He’s just slow to respond to texts. And voice mails.”

This was rough. I loved Jen. Like a sister. Since freshman year orientation. That’s when I had met Jen, Phoebe, Matty, Monica and Joey and we all had became best friends for life bonding over coffee, cannabis and bad sitcoms. But Jen and Matty? It was more than just friends. It was *fire*.

Anyhow, time for that last cup of coffee. Got to make it count. The trick was reheating the coffee and dark chocolate covered almonds and espresso beans to the proper temperature before transferring the chocolate infused brew into proper coffee mugs. The ones on my kitchen counter sported Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall images all over them. When the chocolate had fully melted into the coffee, I slowly began stirring the sugary caffeinated concoction with a steel chopstick. Joe began to imitate my life; boil, boil, toil and trouble. I lowered the flame to a faint blue simmer while continuing to stir clockwise. I looked down at Matty’s hastily abandoned sneaker. There was more mold and mildew on it then the last time I had glanced. I looked down at my own feet. They seemed fine. Matty’s shoe looked pretty expensive and not to have seen very much mileage.

*Two hours ago*

I had been going through the divorce from hell. I needed someone I could trust. Phoebe was trying to ruin me. I think her lawyer had something personal against me too. She had passed me in the hallway of her law firm once and I could have sworn she muttered, “trout breath,” at me.

“It’s your upper lip,” I had heard myself mutter back.

Matty: “Dave, baby. We’re blood brothers since ’86 baby. Blood brothers, Dave. We bros gotta stick together. We all fam, Dave. No child left behind.”

Me: “Phoebe and her shyster are trying to eat me alive in the divorce, Matty.”

Matty: “Dude. That fucking bitch. I always knew she was a bitch, bruh. But my cousin Charlie’s hooking you up, right? Jen and I got you, my brother.”

I had foolishly sought representation from Matty’s ambulance chasing cousin, Charlie, who was always with the runny nose and the Abbott & Costello Haunted House Painting eyes.

“No. That’s another thing I needed to talk to you about, bruh,” I had told Matty. “Charlie’s a,” and then I called Charlie a bad word.

Matty had frowned.

“But he ain’t even charging, bruh!”

“Maybe, but I get the feeling it’s gonna cost me. Probably a lot if Charlie don’t get dropped now.”

Matty frowned. He did that when he didn’t get his way.

“I got a plan, Matty,” I said with a smile that came to my face but was a sad one just the same.

Matty: “Oh, shit. My blood brother,” Matty exclaimed lighting up like a pinball machine. “My man got a secret cash stash, amirite? You flexin’, hoss? Gimme the loot, gimme the loot!”

I had shrugged. Whenever Matty tried to be urban I felt embarrassed for him, his parents, their parents and….

Me: “Matty. I wanna show you something.”

Matty: “Yeah, hoss. You gonna show me the loot, loot?”

Matty’s eyes lit up like Christmas in Sin City.

I had pulled a joint out of my pocket.

“See that wall?” I asked Matty.

Matty seemed annoyed.

“The one with the mold? Yeah, so what? It’s fucking disgusting! You should do something about that.”

“Never mind that,” I said. “You watching?” I asked, emphasizing my words with my eyebrows like a stern Groucho.

Matty often had intrusive thoughts and could be a little obsessive compulsive from time to time. He had ADHD too.

“Okay, hoss, I’m watching,” Matty had said. “What’s the gag? You want me to hold your cash stash, brose?”

I took the joint, a barbecue lighter, got the joint going and filled my lungs with a healthy drag.

I then looked at Matty, let out the smoke and said, “WATCH!”

I then flicked the joint at a big moldy spot covering a large swath of the wall in shimmering spores from cabinet to shining cabinet.

Before the joint could collide with the spore zone it simply vanished. Into. Thin. Air.

“Oh shit! What the fuck!?!?!” Matty exclaimed his eyes big as an 80s satellite dish.

“It’s the craziest thing,” I began. “You wanna hear about it?”

Matty said he did.

So, I told him the story.

And then Matty didn’t believe me. So as usual we argued. But this time Matty got a little physical. I wasn’t going to fight my brother. But before it came to blows Matty slipped on some mold and mildew. Yeah, fate put out a foot and Matty slipped and then-we loop back to the beginning: **Matty’s gone**

But Jen didn’t know what Bo knows. Jen didn’t know why there was a lonely shoe on my kitchen floor and I wasn’t ready to tell her where her betrothed might be. Was there more mold there then before I awoke? No, it was only under the sink and on the wall. What a sad fucking song I was singing. Mold and Mildew, how do you do?

“Dave! David! Fucking Earth to David?!?! Hello, McFly!?”

I looked at Jen.

“Tell me slowly from the beginning why you keep saying my Matty is gone and you need to fucking have me roust Phoebe to come here when you know she only likes you slightly better than her peanut allergy.”

“Phoebe’s still coming, right?” I asked.

Jen put down her coffee with a thud. Archer looked at her. His ears were a bit back and he had that golden retriever should I be worried look.

“You’re fucking neurotic, David. And yes, she’s coming.” Jen looked at her watch. “And, in about ten minutes, so if you’re going to tell me what the big funny fucking joke is now would be the right time.”

Jen was right. I had to tell her. She was a solid citizen. Ever since we were all living together during college. Yeah, I could tell, Jen.

“Listen, David. We had our coffee. You showed me your gain of function biohazard spore farm of a fucking wall. Now tell me what the fuck you’re talking about. Seriously.”

I went into my freezer and got a joint out of a Tupperware.  I got it lit. I took a hit. I let it out and said, “I’m going to flick this at the wall. And this joint is going to fucking blink the fucking fuckity fuck out of actual existence. Do you understand?”

Jen said, “You might wanna give that legal weed a rest, Dave.”

“You watching?”

When I was sure Jen was, I flicked it at the spot and it blinked out of existence.

“Oh shit! What the fuck!?!?!” Jen exclaimed her eyes big as an 80s satellite dish.

“That’s what everybody says,” I said.

“David?”

It looked like school was in session and it was time to tell the tale.

“It started back in ’99 when I flicked a joint in my freezer and it straight up disappeared. Couldn’t find it anywhere. Bugged me the fuck out.

Then couple of years later I was hiding an ounce from Phoebe under the baseboard heater. And then when I went to retrieve it, I bobbled it and it bounced off my knee and landed under the sink in the mold and well, poof. Bye-bye, Maui Wowie.”

“What the actual fuck does this have to do with you calling me like I’m 9-1-1 to report a missing Matty? And what the fuck is up with his shoe? And this fucking mold and mildew black hole? Your landlord is supposed to fix this shit. It's a biohazard.

Now, David, I am telling you, if you and Matty are fucking around with me you’ll both be wearing your nuts for earrings. Now. Where. The. Fuck. Is. My. Husband?”

“Okay,” I said taking a slow and deep breath through my nostrils. Archer looked at me. I put out my hand in the stay it’s okay sign. Archer reluctantly plopped down and sighed audibly.

“Matty and I are definitely not fucking with you, Jen. I’m not, well, I'm just not exactly, erm, specifically," I made a vague Italian gesture with my hand. I tried to solider on, "Erm, I'm not literally, exactly sure where Matty is, well, physically located, right now.

Honest to God! Listen Jen! Phoebe’s gonna be here any minute and there's some things I need you to know! Okay?”

Jen looked at me and wrinkled her nose. “Talk.”

“You know Phoebe’s divorcing me like it was feeding time in the piranha tank, right?” I asked.

“Well, you’re both my friend so…” Jen said lackadaisically.

“Well, that’s how it is. But, ya know. The last couple of years something really changed between us. It was like I couldn’t do anything right. And Phoebe kept acting like I was the one acting all *sus*. She kept wanting to check my phone. Accusing me of, of being, I guess, well, non-monogamous. Asking me if I wanted to open things up.

She asked me if I wanted to go on a break, Jen! And her fucking spending. Once the bills came due for horse psychics, spa weekends and her Atlantic City junkets, well, I sat her down to talk. So, well, she just told me straight-up, no chaser, and I shit you not, ‘I’m a blonde bombshell! Do you understand me, David!?!? A blonde bombshell, David. Bomb. Shell. Boom. Blonde bombshell.”

Jen forgot she was annoyed at me and that maybe Matty was eating cheese by himself with only one shoe on in some black mouse hole sun even Rod Serling had never heard of.

Jen said. “*Bombshell*?!? What is that even supposed to mean?”

“It means I had a rap with my bro, and your hubby, Matty. And he got me his cousin Charlie the lawyer to represent. I figured you were trying to stay neutral, like Switzerland but shit. Jen! All our joint accounts got drained. And then all our joint credit cards got max’d and not even remotely relaxed. I heard Phoebe on the phone telling Monica she got her butthole bleached. Twice.”

Jen sighed as understanding dawned upon her face. Imagine how she'd feel by high noon.

"Anyway, after Phoebe split, she served me with divorce papers the very next day. And then fucking Choo-choo Charlie kept telling me he had it all under control but I had this feeling he needed to go look up control in the dictionary but I didn’t have time to wait. So..., I decided to hire a specialist. “

“A specialist? You mean a fucking private eye? Like fucking Spenser for Hire?”

“Mmm, not quite. There’s this curio shop by the French Café. They sell all this occult shit. Books and potions. Anyway, I saw the proprietor while I was on line at the French café so I asked him about moldy Brooklyn walls that eat shit.”

Jen's eyebrows did that thing. “No shit?”

“Abosolute zero shit. And guess what? Dude had a book called, 'Mystically Malevolent Medieval Mold and Mildew'. Dude said the right kinda mold and mildew can open holes into other dimensions and shit. Dark shitholes, Jen. Hungry shitholes with hungrier shit that wants to eat shit from our dimension like a croc eating a deer. It ain’t pretty, Jen. Crocs eating deer ain’t really pretty and it ain't really me, rent stabilization or no rent stabilization.”

“Does this specialist have a name?” Jen asked. Jen always focused on the stuff on the periphery.

“Yeah. Herman. Anyway, this fucking Herman dude has a cousin who’s a retired NYPD detective and he did Herman a favor after I gave him some loot and showed him the mold situation.”

I took another joint out deciding I’d smoke it before flicking it into wherever the fuck the wild things are.

Jen said, “This is fucking crazy. You had a detective follow Phoebe?”

“She’s been fucking this other dude, Jen. For at least two years.”

Jen’s eyebrows went up like those things over the 6 key.

“You’re sure? Phoebe? No fucking way. Not our Phoebe. She wouldn't even cheat on a break.”

I shook my head.

“There's no doubt about it. He found receipts. Phone records. Security footage. He followed her around. You get the picture, now?”

Jen tilted her chin to catch the last drop of my espresso almond mocha latte.

Without warning the front door buzzer buzzed loudly. Archer got up on his hind legs. And barked. A lot.

“That’s gotta be Phoebe,” I said.

Archer got a little nuts and started running back and forth across our tiny one bedroom.

A minute later I let Phoebe in. She brushed past me. Archer approached her cautiously. She looked down at him. Archer sniffed her crotch, looked at me, then decided to return to Jen’s side on the floor.

Phoebe kissed Jen on the cheek.

“Okay,” Phoebe said. “What was so fucking important that your lawyer couldn’t tell my lawyer, David. You know we are not supposed to communicate directly. And you know exactly why. It’s because you are a narcissistic, cheating and delusional rap music loving, left leaning, emotionally dysregulated toon of a television character. A goddamned, shallow and superficial, two-dimensional dufus while I am a spiritually enlightened, well-adjusted and resilient five-dimensional goddess bombshell. Get it? Understand Dave? Do? You? Understand? Comprendes?”

“Got it! I’m a *delulu* Cluster B-Boy and you, you are the Queen of Sheba. I got it. But I got to tell you something about Matty, and it also involves money.”

Phoebe’s face relaxed a bit. It seemed to be engrossed in some calculus.

“What money? What about Matty?”

I took a manila envelope out from under the kitchen counter and took three 8x10 photos out and placed them face down.

I moved them around.

“This isn’t funny,” Phoebe complained.

“David….” Jen intoned.

“Patience,” I counseled. I then pulled out another envelope. I emptied its contents on the kitchen counter. It was nearly a hundred large. Phoebe’s eyes looked like two black holes in the sky.

“Come here *Phoeebs*. Watch the watch.”

Like a moth to a flame Phoebe approached the cash stacks wide eyed.

*Gimme the loot Gimme the loot*

 “I knew you were fucking holding out!” Phoebe snarled.

“It’s yours,” I said. “All you gotta do is flip the photos without falling off the Earth.”

Phoebe pushed past me, standing near Matty’s now moldy shoe. Yeah, that shoe was moldy as fuck. What a difference thirty minutes makes.

Phoebe looked at the cash. Realizing it was real she furiously flipped the photos.

Photo #3

Matty and Phoebe knocking boots in our marital bed. My red blanket was mostly off the bed and the corner of the blanket was wet with dog slobber dripping from Archer’s mouth.

“Phoebe? You fucked my husband?” Jen asked incredulously.

Phoebe looked up. Archer let out a low sound that could have been a prelude to a low growl.

“PHOEBE?!?!”

Phoebe looked at Jen. Then she looked at me.

“So. Fucking. What? Friends? We’re not friends. Hah. Don’t make me laugh. We drink fucking coffee together and split rent because the cost of living forces my blonde bombshell bootyliciousness to deal with you fucking rug rats. So, if I wanted to fuck Matty then Matty’s getting fucked. Okay?”

I looked at Jen.

“Wanna see something really fucked up, Jen?”

Jen looked at me. Then she looked at the pictures. Then she looked at Phoebe.

“Yes. I do want to see something really fucked up, Dave.”

I nodded. I looked at Archer. I put up my hand and said, “Stay! Archer stayyy.”

Phoebe said, “Give me the fucking loot-“ but before she could finish, I stepped behind her. I grabbed my soon to be ex-wife by her shoulders.

"*OWWWWW*!" she said, indignant annoyance stretching like boardwalk taffy in July.

I put the sole of my non-mildewed, running shoe against Phoebe's butt. I took in a lot of air through my nostrils.

Then I kicked her ass and the rest of her into the black hole sun mystical mold & mildew without further ado.

“Bitch,” I said.

Phoebe yelled, “You mother- “but I never got the rest of it because she hit the wall in the nastiest and moldiest part and clear kept going deep into the nothingness.

And nothing is exactly what I felt when I looked at Jen and said, “I really gotta move to a new crib."

“You really fucking do,” she said. “Like grab the loot, grab Archer, and let’s get the fuck out of here.”

Sometimes, I did as I was told.

Downstairs on the street Joey and Monica were pulling up in front of the hydrant in Joey’s new SUV.

 “*Heyyyyyy*, guys! Where’s your better-halves?” Monica laughed alone and too *b*oisterously at her own joke.

Joey said, “Hey Jen! Hey Dave! Yeah! Where’s Phoeebs and Matty?”

I looked at Jen. Jen looked at me. Archer looked at everybody with that golden retriever, should I be worried look.

I didn’t know what to say. So, I said nothing. Somewhere I heard a car stereo playing Don’t Stop Believing by Journey. Kinda makes you question everything, you know?
