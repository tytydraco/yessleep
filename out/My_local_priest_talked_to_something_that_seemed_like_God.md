Until I was thirteen, I lived in a desolate town around Baja Arizona. Half of the dwindling population was Hispanic, with the other half being the descendants of mostly Irish immigrant workers who came out here to work in the old silver mine. Today, the mine has long since been depleted, and our small community was racked with unemployment. Most who did work worked in the nearest city, and some only came back to their families on the weekend. Sunday mass was unmissable, and was the one day out of the week that I would be reminded that my town was still alive. 

The bone white church stood in the center of the community, and every dust road led to its doors. Sunday mornings, I would dress myself in my best clothes and walk to the Holy building with my mother, father, older brother and infant sister. This particular Sunday began like all the rest, with a dozen or more other families following our same routine. It was early December, although you couldn't tell from the cloudless sky. Nearing midday, it was already 66 degrees and rising, although the blisteringly cold nights made up for the warm days. After the short walk we reached the church, where the usual crowd of townsfolk congregated inside. My family entered the fray, and immediately noticed something was off. 

Father Abascal was our only resident priest. He was born here in the 1950s, before moving to California. There, he entered priesthood and took on the role of missionary, traveling primarily to central Africa to spread the word of the lord, as well as polio vaccines. Father Abascal talked often of his time in developing nations, and usually found a way to tie his experiences in with whatever parable we were covering. Later in life, he opted for a change of pace and returned to his hometown, whose population had halved since he left. In the fifteen years since his return, it has halved again. But our community's future, or a lack thereof, was not the troubling thing the crowd  were discussing that day. 

An hour before, the Spanish language mass had taken place. Those in attendance, mostly older folk, now seemed distraught. I wasn't fluent in Spanish, but learned it at school and heard it around town regularly enough that I could pick up the majority of what they were saying. Father Abascal seemed tired and unprofessional. There were large gaps of silence in his sermons, and he seemed to constantly slur his words. The organ player had not shown up, nor had the altar boys. Father Abascal staggered through mass on his own, and had barked at the old attendees to stay behind. Before this talk could reach the ears of everyone in the crowd, the church bell rang out and we began to fold into the pews. Sunday mass was packed to the rafters most weeks, but in the lead up to Christmas, the church now weekly housed the town's entire, diminutive population. A continuous drone of talk and gossip continued as we took our seats, and ended abruptly when Father Abascal emerged. 

I was near the front, and had the displeasure of seeing him clearly in that state. His tired eyes were ringed with black bags that seemed to sag down his face. He looked around the congregation frantically, and both the bridge of his nose and the corners of his lips twitched uncontrollably. His usual plump cheeks appeared sunken and grey. He lurched uneasily toward the altar like a marionette. Hushed whispers enveloped the congregation, all directed at the priest's state. I looked around, catching the glances of many who likewise searched around in confusion. Father Abascal cleared his throat, ready to speak. This turned into a cough fit, which had him bent double, spluttering into his elbow. When he righted himself, I saw that his sleeve was now freshly stained black. He gripped both sides of his altar, his raw fingernails digging into the masonry. Finally, he spoke. 

“Fine people,” he began, his voice laboured and hoarse, “I am become a witness. I have received confirmation from above of my most evil minded suspicions.”

Gasps erupted. Some stood, shocked at the Holy man's claim. I looked at my parents, who sat pensively, not yet ready to discredit the man who'd just baptised their first daughter. 

“While I slept, He spoke to me, He showed me terrible things and commanded my next actions,” Father Abascal continued, “I know now of the Great Breach of the Papacy. Please, be seated as I spread deistic warning.”

Some faltered and sat back down. Others, the more agitated among them, rushed to the doors only to find them locked. As were the windows. Father Abascal cleared his throat, flecks of black bile peppering his clerical gowns. Then he continued. 

“It began with Theophylact, Count of Tusculum,” He said, a crazed look in his eye, “he and his wife Theodora had an insatiable hunger for power. Insatiable. In 903 AD, Theophylact met with a hooded man, shortly after midnight. The hooded man presented him with a deal. He would aid in the family's conquest, in return for a betrothal to one of Theophylact's descendents. He agreed willingly to these terms, and shook the hooded man's hand on this matter. They never met again, but within the year, Theophylact and his family had consolidated power over all Rome. From the day of that deal onwards, however, the hand Theophylact had shaken with the hooded man became frost bitten, forcing him to bind it for the rest of his days.”

Father Abascal showed his own hand for dramatic effect. I can remember tugging at my collar, feeling hot and anxious. I looked to my parents for guidance, but they remained apprehensive to act. With nothing else to do, I slumped back into the pew and continued watching the rambling. I wondered what jokes I could make about it tomorrow at school, where it'd assumedly be all people would be talking about. 

“From then on, years of ruinous debauchery plagued the Papacy,” Abascal continued, “Rome was ruled by harlots! For decades, it was under the thumb of the House of Theophylact, until the army of the Holy Roman Empire was forced to intervene. But even this only dampened the heretical flame.”

Father Abascal slumped forward onto the altar, panting. He looked physically exhausted. An old woman shuffled to his side, but he shook her off, commanding she sit back down. He took some deep breaths, righted himself, and kept going. 

“In 996 AD, it came time for the hooded man to collect his debt,” He spoke in a morose and shaken voice, “and collect it he did. Maria, wife of Gregory I, grandson of Theophylact, became pregnant with twins. But only one of them was hers. The other was instilled by the hooded man.”

The crowd stirred as we all realised the implication. Abascal continued. 

“It was The Unholy Son, birthed from the womb of a whore with an accursed lineage. And birth it she did, for in the 25th night of July in 996, it came gushing out of her in a torrent of blood. So did Maria's natural born son, whom she cradled while the leech was set down upon the dirty floor. As soon as its infantile costume touched the stone, the door burst open. A farm dog ran it and attacked the newborn, tearing it apart. Like that, the antichrist had been sealed for another thousand years.”

The use of the word “antichrist” sent the congregation into a frenzy. People stood, shouting at Abascal to step down. Some rushed to his side, only to have the deranged priest roar at them, demanding he be allowed to spread God's recent message. Even my parents were stirred, although they stopped short of rushing their kids out of there. Father Abascal finally took the church back under his control, if only by being the loudest voice there. After another coughing fit, he hauled a case that had been set down by his side onto the altar. It was long and tubular, not unlike something used to carry a rolled up map. He unscrewed the cap, but stopped short of taking out whatever was within. He bent over the altar again and started to speak. 

“But the evil hadn't been wholly killed off. Part of it festered in its womb-brother, who grew up to become the wealthy count, Alberic III. His own son, Theophylact III, became Pope at just twenty years of age. A malice unfound in any man before him accompanied his pontificate. Murder, rape, incest and beastiality all found a common home in the Lateran Palace. He ruled as Benedict IX, becoming Pope three times and committing high simony as he did, selling the very Papacy for a sum of gold. His leadership was ruinous, and achieved only the splitting of the church in 1054. Eventually, holy forces did defeat this antipeter, but the House of Theophylact remained tainted. Their bloodline spawned countless adversarial members until their domain, the town of Tusculum, was completely levelled by the Crescentii family. Now this accursed lineage was scattered across the known world, and eventually the new world.”

Father Abascal faltered. His breathing seemed cancerous now, as his bile filled lungs worked to deliver us this message. 

“I've been told from above,” he said again as he raised his head, “that the chosen descendent is among us. In this chapel.”

Anarchy. People leapt from their seats, many trying for the locked door. Abascal raged, though few heeded him. He swore, and said things I thought I'd never hear him say. I looked at my parents, who likewise were now getting up for the pew. I stood, not taking my eyes from the mad priest. He had heaved the carrier bag onto the altar and removed the lid. He slid out the contents onto the marble slab and for a second, I thought it was a map. Until Father Abascal unfurled it. It was some sort of tapestry, ancient and crumbling. He took two corners and held it up in front of the congregation. The scene depicted had faded, but I could tell it was to do with the story Abascal had just recanted. It showed a dog, drawn with a distinctly medieval quality, with an infant's head in its jaws. The rest of the baby flailed in the air. On its forehead was a symbol, one I could barely remember but later identified as the seal of lucifer. As I looked at it, I felt the tears that had welled in my eyes grow hot. They were boiling. 

Suddenly, my mother burst into flames. My sister too, cradled in her arms, was engulfed. The manic crowd's attention turned to the sudden immolation. Father Abascal began screaming like a fanatic and rushed towards us, but was held back by one of the attendees. I burst into tears as my brother dragged me away from the human pyre. My father threw off his jacket, attempting to quell the flames. It was no use. My mother died between the pews, suffocated by the smoke borne from her burning flesh. It was all over so fast. My father collapsed to his knees, trying to drag his wife from the position she reflexively crumpled into. By now, the wooden pew had caught alight, and other members of the church had to force my dad away from the spreading fire. All the while, Abascal screamed about how he'd purged the evil.

The doors didn't budge. A stone basin of Holy water was upheaved and used to pummel the entrance like a battering ram. As the fire spread and the crowd became more desperate for salvation, someone threw a statue of Our Lady of Gaudalupe through one of the stained glass windows bearing the image of Christ's crucifixion. She shattered her son, and for a brief moment I thought we finally had a path of escape until I realised what was so desperately wrong with the scene. Despite it being noon, there was nothing outside but darkness. I stumbled back, watching everyone I knew act like wild animals in their attempt at escape. Old men and children were crumpled underfoot as the stampeding faithful tried to break out into the fake night. My breathing drew heavy as my eyes began to close. There was smoke all around me. It was all I could smell. All I could taste. It was everything. The sound of screams dampened as I fell into unconsciousness. 

I awoke an unknowable amount of time later to the sound of a baby crying. There were stars overhead, and as I pushed myself up from the charred floor, I realised the chapel's roof had burned to ashes. I was surrounded by a black ruin. I stood, surveying the debris of smoking embers and bone for the source of the crying. I walked unsteadily towards it, carbon crunching under my shoes. Bodies, cooked alive during the fire, were scattered all around. Most were concentrated in the large pile, stacked where the broken window once stood. The ash of the burnt pews covered everything in a black carpet, including my baby sister. I leaned down and picked her up, tearing her from the skeletal grasp of my mother. I brushed her down and let her cling to my shoulder, putting a calming hand on her back as I soothed the infant. Other than some dust, she hadn't been harmed. That was impossible, I can remember thinking to myself. I saw her become engulfed in flames. And then I realised I myself was a miracle. 

Human remains surrounded me where I had lain, all dead by immolation. Despite this, I didn't have the slightest burn. The impossibility of it all was the last thought on my mind, however, as I realised I was now alone in the world. I identified my father from the scraps of fabric that remained of his pale blue jacket, and my brother from the metal watch which had begun to melt and fused to his wrist bone. My family had been whittled down to just me and my sister. I stumbled through the burnt, crumbling doors and went outside. There, I started to cry. I kept crying for some time, accompanied by the baby I now clung to. I didn't stop until I heard something move in the darkness. I wiped my red cheeks and tapered my whimpers, then tried to do the same with my sister. I could now hear someone trying to walk towards us. Their feet dragged slightly in the dusty road, and the noise of their shambling grew louder each passing second. Still, the night enshrouded them. White ash fell like snow, although the temperature had begun to drop so low that a blizzard wouldn't feel out of place. I realised my sister was shivering, and held her tighter, trying to pass on what body warmth I had left. A figure appeared, just a silhouette and their current distance. Silently, they kept coming closer. 

“Hello?” I said in a low voice. 

My first and most obvious assumption was that it was one of the townsfolk, one who didn't show up to mass this morning. Surely, I can remember thinking to myself, there must've been a fair few still left in their homes when the fire erupted. It wasn't until the figure was almost directly in front of me did I realise how wrong I was. It stood still now, dressed in a long, tattered black robe. White ash flakes collect on its broad shoulders and once pointed hood. I couldn't see any face within, just more darkness that outdid the night sky. I felt bolted to the floor from fear, and maybe something else.

“Ireup ihim ad,” the robbed man said, speaking with a warped, baritone voice. 

It then reached out its arms. From within its long sleeves, two necrotic hands appeared. Maggots festered under its black finger nails and the skin sagged down from a build up of pus. I realised it wanted me to give it my sister.

“Who… who are you?” I barely managed to say.

“Sutroba ied mus oge,” it said in twisted answer, “Ireup suilli retap.”

Before I could say anything else, the robed figure pulled back its hood. Whatever I saw then now occupies a black hole in my mind, unable to be called upon. Even in the past few days as my reality crumbles, I cannot incur that aberration in my mind's eye. That night in 1996, it caused me to run in terror. I flew past rows of houses, any of which that had been occupied a few hours before were now occupied only by ash. My sister stayed close to me, and I eventually reached the edge of my desolate town. Beyond lay only the Sonoran desert. For miles, nothing, then came the great slab of concrete that was the city of Tucson. I looked back and saw the hooded figure approaching, and decided that the wilderness at night was a worthwhile risk to escape anything that bore that face. 

I had no idea what direction I was heading. I was only wearing a t-shirt and shorts. I now carried my sister under my shirt, and my exposed legs were cut up by glass-like shrubs. I had an idea of the landscape I was traversing from what I saw during the day. It was empty, apart from the dried undergrowth and occasional rock formation. The cracked ground was made almost entirely of orange hued dust. That night, my visibility was extremely limited, and would have been reduced to nothing at all if not for the slither of moonlight. It was barely enough to let me see directly in front of me, and did nothing to reveal the constant loose rocks I kept tripping over. I could see my breath trail behind me, and kept moving despite how tired I felt. Every noise, every movement in the corner of my eye spurred me on as I pictured that thing in the tattered robe lurching towards me. My feet were covered in blisters. My sister was crying, and although I wanted desperately to join her, I felt the need to keep myself together. For her sake. I couldn't lose what little I had left. So I kept walking. Until it started to snow. 

I had never seen snow before, not really. I'd seen mountains from a car window, ones with white peaks, but never experienced it first hand. For a time, I thought I finally had. I thought my annual Christmas Eve wish had finally been granted at the worst time possible. And although the white flakes burned with a cold intensity, I came to realise they were not snowflakes. They were ash. The hooded figure was near. I'd begun to walk with a stupor, and felt my hands go numb. My feet were like weights, ones I struggled to drag behind me. The fake snow came down harder as I tried to find a road, and prayed that a car would soon pass. The breaking of branches in the darkness just a few paces behind me powered me on, but only for so far. The cold was beginning to numb my mind. I couldn't take it anymore. I stumbled forward and, behind a small bush, found salvation. 

North of my town, there was a small ranch near the banks of the Santa Cruz. Some of the men in my town used to work there, and my older brother got a summer job in ‘95 driving around and looking out for any cattle that had wandered off. I accompanied him on one of the trips, but we found nothing that day. Tonight, however, I did. Laying in the dust was a dead cow, leathered by the day's sun. A prehistoric instinct awoke in me, and I knew what I had to do. I slid my barely breathing sister from under my shirt, and placed her on the ground. I took a jagged rock in one hand and slit the bloated bovine stomach open. I took my sister back into my arms, just moments before I heard a yelping and scurrying in the shrubs just beyond us. I clutched her tight and pinched my nose. Then, I crawled inside. 

No light penetrated the rotting skin, and as such, we were left in total darkness. This was a blessing in disguise, as I could not see the maggots that festered around me. Despite my nose being clogged with ash and dust, slithers of odour seeped through and made me gag. My sister started to cry. This too was a blessing in disguise, as it assured me she was still alive. The fetal position was the only way I could make it between the beast's ribs, and that's how I stayed as I heard footsteps around me. Something out there was circling us. I tried to convince myself that it was just a coyote, and that the thing in the robe couldn't have followed us all this way. Whatever it was stopped right in front of the cow's stomach, and did not move again for a long time. 

Exhausted, but warm, I was on the edge of sleep when it happened. Light. Just a crack. My eyes adjusted and I realised the crude slit I'd carved into the corpse was being tugged at. It was being opened. As I watched in horror, I started to make out the shape of a hand. Nearly human. Just a silhouette, but I could clearly make out the shape of the knuckles. The fingers were on the inside, pulling back the fleshly lip. Like a toddler, I closed my eyes tighter and simply wished for it to be gone. For everything bad to be gone. I clutched my sister tightly. Thankfully, she'd stopped crying. That meant I could finally get some sleep. I couldn't wait to sleep. I was so tired. My body ached. At the same time, I also couldn't wait to wake up from this horrible nightmare.

Sunlight. A bright yellow seeped into the cavity, lighting it up. I came to, and slowly dragged myself out of the rancid shelter. Once I could, I stood. Looking around, I realised I was just a few yards from the road. Before I began my trek, I sat back in the sand and examined my sister. I hadn't let go of her all through the night. As I cradled her, I realised she wasn't breathing. She was silent and still. She was dead. I had officially lost everything. But I physically couldn't cry anymore, so I got to my feet and started to walk. I wrapped my sister in my t-shirt and carried her with me. The sun was high and I was now sweating as I walked, rather than freezing. No trace of ash could be seen on the desert floor, and I wondered if it had been there at all. I kept walking along that road for hours until, eventually, a car passed me. It stopped, and a kind couple emerged to help me. They bundled me into their car, firing a blur of questions in my direction. I don't remember much of the drive to Tucson, but I do remember my stay at the hospital there. The next day, a man came in and sat by my bed. In the calm way he'd been trained to be, he explained in simple terms that my town had been destroyed by a wildfire. The recovery was ongoing, but it wasn't looking good. He was right. Within the week, my parents and brother were declared dead, as were the rest of the townsfolk.

The following Friday, as I sat up in my hospital bed, I received another piece of news that proved itself to be worse than anything I heard prior. A nurse came to me, and asked if I wanted to see my sister. At first, I thought she meant it final goodbye, and so I began to get out of bed. But she stopped me, and soon after another nurse came in cradling my baby sister. She was crying and squirming in the nurse's inexperienced hands. I looked on, shocked as she walked to my bedside and placed my only living relative in my arms. 

I spent the rest of my years before eighteen in the foster system. Not long after that night, my sister was adopted. I recently learned that they're a staggeringly rich family living in northern California, and gave my sister the name of Armilia. For years, I was content not to have any part in her life. She didn't know me, not really, and I didn't know how much her adoptive parents told her about where she came from. I didn't want to ruin her life again. The years spiralled by, and I spent many of them working on oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Isolation suited me, which is probably why when I retired early after my knees and back gave out, I moved to Wyoming. That was earlier this year, when I figured that what I had in the bank and some odd jobs would keep me going for the foreseeable future. That dream of tranquility was shattered in the past week.

Someone is talking to me, and it's the same someone who spoke to Abascal in 1996. He was convinced it was God Himself. I don't know what it is. It comes to me in my sleep, paralysing me where I lay and reciting dissonant commands as I struggle to breathe. It told me things. It told me the truth. It told me what my sister is, and what great terror she'll unleash when she turns 33. Her 33rd birthday is just three short years away. That's all the time I have to find her and kill her.
