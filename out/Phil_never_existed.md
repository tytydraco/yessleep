There is this running saying in my family that everyone must tell their child "Phil never existed", now, obviously, this confused a lot of us, why so specific?, we were never ever told why this would be said. Phil seems to be a very cursed name in our family, so a lot of me and my cousins needed to know quickly. I once tried to find the source when I was 8, and I looked everywhere I could; Now I say "I could" because there was a strange keyhole in the Floor and I never found the key, and I couldn't look through the keyhole as it is much too small, but I distinctly remember a weird and unusual smell, one that smelt like our Christmas dinner  
  
When I woke up this morning, My mother asked me to take the water bottles out of the basement, I went and got a pack and took them up, I went back down And picked up the second back, But in the packaging I realised that there was a silver thing inside so I took it out then put it in my pocket and gave the water bottles to my mother. I was confused about this object so I examined it and realised it was a tiny key. I was wondering what it might lead to but then I remembered the keyhole I saw when I was 8, as I was confused and wondering why this is here, I realised there must be a very horrible secret being held from most of the children in this family, so I went back down to the basement to see if I could find the keyhole  
  
I was looking all around but couldn't find it, I almost gave up but then I remembered that there was a really strange new wardrobe put in the middle of the room, I pushed it and there it was! the keyhole. I opened it and climbed down, but to my surprise there wasn't a treasure or something along the likes, It was multiple dismembered corpses of children, that's when it came to me, There are currently no people named Phil in this town, And it wasn't a coincident, when my father took me to his workplace, I saw paperwork from two guys named Phil, and I saw they were born near my Road. I was so confused on why anyone would do something horrible like this.  
  
A bad thought rushed over my head, the meat at the Christmas dinner we have every year was said to be horse meat, but I always go with the food-maker for the years Christmas when they go shopping, and not once have I ever seen horse meat being sold, and I saw chunks from the people missing, I almost threw up to the thought, unfortunately there is no good ending here. We still live like we always do, but I still know the secret, So whenever Christmas dinner is served, I just say I don't want any beforehand
