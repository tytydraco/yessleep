In around 2015 I got sucked into family history. In Scotland we love a little deep dive into clan history. I'm a Campbell, just like a tin of soup. We have our own tartan, our own words: Cruachain! We've spread far and wide, my wee bonny clan. There are Campbell’s in America, in Australia, in short, we’re all over the place. Maybe you're a Campbell, if so, nice to meet you brother! 

As a rabbid family historian, I popped over to Ancestry.com. Even paid for the premium membership. Disappointingly most of my closest relatives never really made it out of Scotland, nor even the crappy little mining town I live in. One did, however, and his was by far the most interesting branch on ye olde family tree. 

Alexander was my great, great, great, great, uncle who moved to London, sometime in the eighteenth century. He had a wife called Murran MacDonald who was as a photographer (rare for a woman during the period) and two daughters named Susan and Lesley. I briefly wondered if Murran was of some relation to my wife, they had a shared surname. He worked at the docks and seemed to be a proper working class geezer. He'd jumped down the border for a better life. 

Don't think he found it though. Seems a hard thing to grasp, a better life.

For his tree ends. His daughters never marry or have children, and his wife, Murran, falls off the record too. There's no death records, nothing. A great big stinking mystery. That was until one of my links, Martin MacDonald sent me over a zipped file. He was a descendent from Alexander's brother-in-law. Interestingly there were photos in it. Lots of photos. Probably because Murran was a photographer. Eager to unpack, I opened it.

I suppose for this story to have any meaning to you, I'll have to explain the complicated art of Victorian photography. To be quite blunt, it was shit. Long capture times meant photos of people were blurry. Everyone moves a little, whether through breathing or simple muscle flexes, so there would always be a little blurry halo around people captured in the sepia tones. 

That was of course, unless they were dead. 

Death photography was very popular in the Victorian age, particularly children. You want to remember your loved one, so you snap a little picture. It's natural in some ways. Can't say i’d hang my dead nan on my wall, but I get it to some extent. 

The first photo was of Alexander and his daughters out in the garden. It looked to be a perfectly blissful scene. Little Susan was in the tree, her spindly arms hanging from the branch. Alexander was sprawled out on a bench. Lesley, the elder, was playing by a rose bush, her knees bent beneath her at odd angles.

Onto the next. They were in the living room, lined up for a photo. Alexander sat in the middle, his daughters flanking him, their hands placed on his shoulder. Martin, had left little annotations.  For King James, was scribed onto one. Weird. 

The third was a little odd. The photo was a longshot, with little Lesley in the middle of a snowy field. She was laying in the ground, in a summer dress, odd for the climate. She seemed to be making a snow angel, yet she was pale, and gaunter than in the last. Alexander had a tartan scarf wrapped around his neck, and he was on his knees, hands sunken in the snow. Susan had been buried in powdery white, only her little head was free, and her cheekbones were sunken pits. Campbell's not welcome, had been annotated below. Again. Pretty weird.

Then I noticed it and something in my stomach gave way. The photos were perfectly clear. If you remember what I said earlier, pictures of people in the Victorian age are all blurry. These ones were vivid and missing that blurry aura. I looked through more, not pausing to view the photos, simply reading the annotations. For Scotland. For Clan MacDonald. Never forget. Payback for the Massacre. I opened the final photo.

The Black Dinner was scribed on the final. Alexander sat at the head of the table, deathly clear. Susan and Lesley were there too, their heads dropped into their plates. I felt unease coil in my gut, and something resembling fear burgeoned within me. I was separated from the horror by over a century, yet still I felt it. The discomfort had been sealed as if left in a little time capsule. 

Then I saw her, just her arm, spindly and long, the photographer, Murran, there was blood on her fingertips, and the aura around her was bloodied. She was alive, she alone, had survived.

She saw her error too late, had been annotated in a long little paragraph. Never forget, never forget Glencoe. The blood is sullied, the blood is mixed. 

Then there was another photo, less artfully shot than the last, and it was obvious why, for Murran was no longer the photographer, but rather the subject. She still had a blurry aura, which told me she was alive, she was splayed out on a table, clutching at her bloodied middle. There was a strange fleshy mass beside her, attached to little tubes and viscera. 

So that she may never use it again, had been annotated, let it be known, that no Campbell's shall ever again pollute Clan MacDonald. 

Then my wife tapped me on the shoulder and I shut the laptop quicker than a horse bolts the stocks.

 “What are you doing? More of that family history stuff?” She giggled. “I hope you don't delve too deeply into our families. They've never really gotten along have they? Macdonald's and Campbell’s, always on the opposite sides. Well, never mind, it's time to pick Johnny up from school." 

 Per mare per terras, I thought, ne Obliviscaris.
