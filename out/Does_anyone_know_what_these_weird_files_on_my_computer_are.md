I typed this using a mirror.

If anyone ever finds this message, it means the barrier between us isn’t as solid as we thought.

Every ten years, the air bends and the reflections breathe. We call it the Change. The glass stops copying us—it starts watching. If you see yourself move wrong in the mirror, if it blinks when you don’t, walk away.

It calls itself the Lamb. And when it returns, the world listens.

——

That’s all the file said. Four short paragraphs, sitting in the middle of my desktop in a text file named “01_RETURN.TXT.” No metadata, no trace of when it was created, and somehow no modification date either—just blank spaces where the data should be.

I thought it was some kind of joke or maybe a fragment from an old draft I’d forgotten. I do a lot of late-night writing, sometimes half-asleep, so I figured it was me just being weird again. But the language doesn’t sound like me. I don’t use phrases like “barrier between us.” I don’t write cryptic religious crap about “the Lamb.”

Then the webcam light blinked. Just once, when I opened the file. I froze, stared at it, waited. After a few seconds it went dark again. When I checked my camera folder, there were no new images. Nothing in recent files, no timestamps changed. I unplugged the camera after that, just to be sure.

An hour later, the light came back on—without the webcam even connected.

I ran through every security check I know: malware scan, firewall logs, Wi-Fi devices list. I’ve built PCs, fixed firmware corruption, even done data recovery for friends, so I know what to look for. But nothing showed up. It was clean.

I tried deleting the file next. It wouldn’t go. Every time I emptied the recycle bin, it came back instantly, like the system restored it before I could blink. I checked the command line. Same result. The name changed each time though—the first was “01_RETURN.TXT”, then “02_CHANGE.TXT,” and now it’s “03_MIRROR.TXT.”

That’s when I noticed something else. The timestamp never changes from 3:17 a.m. Even if I reboot. Even if I rename it. Every version is marked 3:17 a.m., like the computer’s trying to tell me that’s when something happened.

I checked my event logs for that time. There’s nothing recorded between 3:16 and 3:19, just a two-minute blank space like the system wasn’t even running. But I know it was on. I was up late that night, reading in bed.

I keep trying to ignore it, but my monitor’s been acting strange too. Whenever I open the file, I can hear faint static from the speakers, even when they’re muted. And once, I swear I saw the reflection of the text on the screen moving a little faster than what I was typing, like it was finishing the words before I did.

I’m not a superstitious person. I don’t believe in ghosts or “digital hauntings.” But I can’t explain this. 

No process, no signal, no program should be able to fake that kind of behavior and cover its tracks this good.

This morning, I woke up to find the screen on. The cursor was moving. Lines were being added to a fourth file—“03_MIRROR.TXT.” No keystrokes, no sounds, no keyboard activity, but words kept appearing in real time.

It stopped after about twenty seconds. I didn’t touch anything for a while, just watched. The screen stayed still. Then the cursor jumped, skipped a line, and typed something new:

“The Lamb returns when the mirrors breathe.”
That’s it. No glitching, no flashing, just that line appearing by itself.

I unplugged the computer and left it off all day, but when I turned it back on tonight, the file was still there, timestamp unchanged.

I’ve backed everything up, and I’ll upload the three files if people actually want to see them. I’m not sure if it’s a prank, or a worm, or something else—but whatever it is, it’s persistent.

And every time I open those files, I swear the reflection in my screen looks like it’s watching me a half-second too late.
