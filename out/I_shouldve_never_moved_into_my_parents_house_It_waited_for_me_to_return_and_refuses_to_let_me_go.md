At 9 a.m. my phone buzzes uncontrollably and the blue light spreads inside my pitch black bedroom.

Last night I had another night shift, working odd jobs on odd hours. Right before attempting to turn off the alarm, I remember something: Today is moving day.

My parents died without a will and I couldn't just let their old house be demolished-after all it's the place I grew up in.

While driving I notice I don't even remember most of my childhood. What is the house going to look like? What do the places I spent most of my time in look like? What kind of atmosphere is going to await me?

I take a deep breath, my keys rustling.

"Why the heck is this door not opening?"

With a gut-wrenching squeacking the door swings open.

A stinging headache hits me the moment I enter.

"No wonder the headache-doing all these shitty part time jobs"

"This house feels like I'm here for the first time, mum and pa must've poisened me to forget everything haha"

Exploring the house I see the big window leading to the yard. It somehow calls me to come closer.

"Whose kids thought it to be a fun idea to smear their hands on the windows?!"

I have to clean the whole house anyway, so it didn't bother me that much, but how did the kid even climb the fence, it's twice as big as me. Besides, the handprints look like from a three-year-old.

I remember my parents insisting on taking the bigger fence because they wanted me and... -my friend I think, to be and feel safe.

The next morning I wake up with back pain but had slept surprisingly well overall.

I made my morning coffee and looked at the yard when noticing something. The handprints are back.

Maybe this was some childish prank-or I just forgot to clean the window.

I grab the cleaning cloth, kneel down and remove the handprints.

As I stood up I see the handprints reappear. 

"What the hell!" I feel the hard floor I landed on. 

I blamed the stress of moving and tried to forget what had occurred. It was best to just ignore it.

The next time I risked a glance at the window I saw a smiley face being drawn-with nobody being there.

I continued my day as usual and waited for the night to come.

The minute I choked down my medication I heard childlike laughter coming from the yard. I held my breath.

It was best to just sleep now.

But even in my dream I was being haunted. I was in my yard, laughing-and then there was a loud thud, and a scream.

The screams kept growing louder and more painful, like the beasts from hell themselves were screaming in agony.

It was like they were eating me alive.

I woke up soaked from sweat and tears-you couldn't tell which was which.

But I knew that the nightmare was not over with waking up.

It had just begun.

Feeling like I've awoken from death I walk to the toilet.

These were the only few minutes of rest.

Limping back to my bedroom I suddenly feel a chill, moving Up from my stomache. Something's not right.

I hadn't noticed the hallway being this dark before.

I pinched myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming-but the nightmare has already followed me into the waking world.

From the end of the hallway a little child is staring at me.

A black liquid dropping from its head onto the floor.

I scream in terror, my heart racing and my head spinning. I pass out.

Waking up on the very same spot the next morning, the first thing I did was cry.

I cried and cried for hours.

After I pulled myself together I decided that I needed to know what I had seen and what the fucking hell is going on in this damn house.

Near the window I find small footprints leading from the yard into the house, some were smeared with a dark liquid.

I look up at the window.

In big, jagged, dripping letters is written

"You kiler"

"You are guilty"

Frozen in shock I stare at the words for multiple minutes.

*My head hurts.*

I follow the footprints.

The headache grows more intense with every step, my vision is blurred and I hear a crying child in the distance.

The footprints lead me to the roof. I had never been allowed up there.

The crying stopped.

*A crack* 

I stepped on something.

It's a picture. A picture of me playing in the yard, crying.

I look at were I was looking, it was a little girl, laying on the grass with her eyes toward the sky.

She was bleeding, she was dead. 

*I killed my sister.*
