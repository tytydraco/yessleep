I have a problem. The grammar correction software on my computer says I should rewrite this sentence to “I need help”. Maybe. It starts with a light grey fog if it is morning, and if it's nighttime, I will just see a glimpse of someone from the corner of my eye.



I cannot take shortcuts anymore.



I was a gifted child and would get by with minimal effort through my teens. There have been days when I’ve put more effort into things than others. This has helped me remain average, with those few moments of extraordinary success. Overall, I’ve managed to stay afloat and be in the field I want to be. But as time took me deeper into the season of adulthood, responsibilities increased and the stakes became higher. The consequences of actions had a bigger impact. A below-average grade in school might not affect one long-term, but during adulthood, one’s livelihood depends on one’s work, and to an extent, the other areas of life do too. I still couldn’t stop taking shortcuts. My relationships suffered because I wanted the easy way to do things. My work colleagues thought of me as lazy but intelligent. I just never learned consistent hard work so making that a part of my life in adulthood felt impossible. I tried, but motivation isn’t enough for consistency. You need habits and you need, well, you need, fear.



I didn’t learn to fear the consequences enough till I met my boss at my last job. Linda was very strict and would go out of her way to make things harder. The woman was a witch, but her daughter, Martha, was a true manifestation of evil. While Linda expected everyone to meet her demands regardless of the workload or high pressure, she didn’t apply the same work ethic to her daughter. Martha was then an intern at our office but Linda was trying to get her daughter placed at an A-tier firm. She was trying to get Martha’s name on pretty much all my work, the same with many of my colleagues.



One major task given to me was creating a list of resources for a big project which would involve me contacting our biggest clients and assessing the resources available at their companies. I kinda delayed sending out those emails and outreach attempts to clients till the last minute. By the time I sent out my first round of communications, we were already near the project’s initial deadline. I knew this was a big project and Linda was hoping for this to be the highlight of Martha’s success while she was at our office. Afraid of having to own up to what I did, I went to the companies’ websites and looked at our previous records. Based on that data, I created a rough estimate of resources. I put these estimate numbers on the list and changed every document to say this was a ‘tentative’ resource list. I told Linda that I hadn’t heard from all the clients and that some numbers had to be estimated figures from our previous records.



Linda seemed fine with the work and we moved on to other tasks. However, a few months later, the project came under ethical scrutiny. The financial ask by our office was based on the available resources from our present clients. However, the actual resources available and the numbers in the report ended up having a seven-million-dollar difference. Since Linda put Martha on the lead, her name was in the ethics committee complaint. Linda immediately tried to put the blame on me and wanted Martha’s name removed from the complaint investigation and process.



I explained to the committee that my numbers were based on the estimates from previous records and the website’s public information. More importantly, I had clearly communicated to Linda that these figures were mere estimates. Martha had taken over the responsibility of drafting the final report. She changed the language in the report and removed the word ‘tentative’ from the document’s language instead of asking me for final figures or getting them confirmed herself. Since most of this was proven by the evidence, I was cleared from the complaint process. Martha, however, got into serious trouble.



I understand where I was wrong and that Linda, expecting me to have done the entire work of researching the numbers, never asked Martha to confirm the figures. At the same time, the figures were estimates and they were tentative.



Regardless, both Linda and Martha blamed me for the downfall of Martha’s career and it was clear no top-tier firms, or any place, would hire her after this disaster. Linda and Martha called me to Linda’s private office during all of this. The conversation was long but essentially Linda told me that I must admit to the investigative team that the job of confirming the numbers had been outsourced to me and that it was my fault that the discrepancy in the final report happened. As much as I wanted for this process to be over, I too needed to think about my own future and this admission would be career suicide for me. I didn’t have the connections or nepotism advantages that Martha had. Linda told me that what I was doing was not right. “You are trying to use a shortcut instead of doing what is right. If you admit to the ethics team that you are responsible for the final report now, we will allow you to stay in the company. If you don’t, I will make sure you can never take any shortcuts in your life ever again”. I refused to admit what I was being asked to. I was fired shortly after.



A few days after I was fired, I got a letter in the mail. It was from Martha and it had her office address. I opened the white ashy-looking envelope. A small yellowing tarnished piece of paper fell out of it. The envelope was otherwise empty. I picked the piece of paper up and it had some strange words on it in a language I didn’t understand. The letters or the alphabet were in English; only the words themselves felt like they belonged to a different language. It was a very short letter, I think, ummm…, must have been like one sentence so seven eight words max. I immediately felt dizzy after seeing the words. I tried to read the words in my head to figure out if the letters actually were incoherent or if it was just me. As soon as I finished reading the sentence, I had the most intense wave of nausea hit me, and immediately after that I fainted.



I don’t know how long I was on the floor for, but when I woke up, it felt like an eternity had passed. The paper was no longer in the room. I had terrible nightmares for days after this. And just like that, I couldn’t take shortcuts in life anymore.



It starts with a light grey fog if it is morning, and if it's nighttime, I will just see a glimpse of someone from the corner of my eye. That’s when I know that I need to stop. Because from here it gets less controllable. I can hear time after this. Not in the ‘tick-tock from the clock’ kinda way. No, it's more of a, actually, I don’t think I can describe it. It's like, umm, well if you think about a color you’ve never seen before and it's not in the color wheel, not cool or warm, nothing like we’ve seen before, how would you describe it? You can’t. That’s what time sounds like. I can’t describe it because it's unlike any sound I have ever heard. I don’t think my brain can process this sound, or my ears for that matter. Because they always bleed after this. Sometimes it feels like something is crawling into them. And then, then, I….. I know they’re here.



It will come from an unexpected spot or opening, like the classic horror movie hands from under the bed. My reflection in the mirror reaching out. Or the door opening even though I locked it. I know to expect it, but I never know what to expect. Every time I experience this, the future version becomes worse and scarier. After this, everything goes dark. In this pitch-black darkness, wet hairy strong arms and hands wrap themselves around my neck. They ask me to choose between myself or another. And as fast as it disappears, my sight comes back. A horrible creature at a small distance, it is feminine and she always has a smile. A sinister smile. She starts to walk towards me, the speed increasing as she covers more and more of the distance between us. I have to choose before she reaches me.



I have always chosen others.



Whoever I choose always dies. Happens in a week. Yeah, as I’m trying to remember, the longest someone has stayed alive is a week: natural causes, accidents, and even murder. The causes can be anything, but they always die, always.



I don’t know if it is the curse itself or just my brain. Whenever I take a shortcut, this process starts. It starts with the fog or glimpse of a person and ends with me having to choose someone. The thing is, if there are others with me when I have taken a shortcut in life, my brain cannot choose a person outside of the crowd of people I’m with at that moment. If I am alone, the choices are unlimited.



A part of my gifted brain usually knows when I am about to take a shortcut in life. There are some moments when I only know because of the process starting. So despite me trying my best, I can’t always avoid it. I have learned to live with it. I had to tell my friends I had a rare type of OCD. So when we go on group trips, if I randomly make them stop or tell them we can’t go on a certain road, it's because of my disease, because my brain can’t take it. I have lost so many people from group activities that involved unexpected shortcuts. Now I try to drive and tell people my OCD is extreme and can lead to severe mental consequences. This helps me avoid fights or the inevitable. I, of course, try to avoid group outings or social events with others altogether.



So why am I reaching out now? Why write about this? You see, I am getting married. Yes, I know, seems crazy impossible. Congratulations to me, despite my condition, I found the one.



I have never met a more caring, loving, supportive, intelligent, and mature man. He compliments my personality perfectly. If it was anyone else, anyone, I wouldn’t be writing this. He doesn’t deserve my curse, though.



My fiance thinks I have some OCD-like mental challenges, and he understands that things need to be done a certain way for me. He respects that. But practically, I can’t always control what we do together. I thought I could, but I’m fooling myself. For instance, yesterday, we were talking about wedding budgeting. He is insanely rich, and his family wants to take care of certain things for the wedding. The fog and sightings have let me know several times that the money his family is offering hasn’t always been earned from fair means. They have used their political positions to earn money in corrupt ways. I can’t accept that money. I can’t take shortcuts. However, with my budget, things can’t be as extravagant as his family likes.



He understands my need to pay for things by ourselves. But that is just one tiny example. I know what you’re thinking. I’m sure you have many questions. How many times has this happened already? Many many times, yes, yes, I am responsible for the death of various people. Why would I do this anyone? I don’t want to, but I guess I’m selfish, I tell myself I have a shot at living a normal life. I tell myself that if I try hard enough, I can live without taking shortcuts and that means I won’t hurt anyone. Why do this to my fiance? Why risk it? I love him, and I can’t let him go. Giving up on being together is like telling myself to give up on life, to give up on, on hope. I just cannot give up on hope. Why not reach out to Martha or Linda? I can’t. I’m too afraid. I’m too afraid. I’m very very afraid. I am scared that if I go to the cemetery, and say something to them, they will answer back.



I told you Martha was the true manifestation of evil. Whatever she cursed me with, I think she anticipated I would try to come to her for a solution. A few days after I received the letter, I was given the news that Martha had hung herself in her office. Linda couldn’t take the news of her daughter’s death, so she followed suit soon after. They made sure I couldn’t take shortcuts.



As I am about to hit the submit button, I can see a glimpse of a person from the corner of my eye. If this is a shortcut, it gives me hope that whoever is reading this can help me find a solution.
