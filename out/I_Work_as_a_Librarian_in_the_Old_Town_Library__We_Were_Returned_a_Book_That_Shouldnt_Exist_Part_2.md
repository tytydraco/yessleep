[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lugeoq/i_work_as_a_librarian_in_the_old_town_library_we/) | Part 2

Since that ill-omened day when I rediscovered the book amidst the other volumes - that dark turning point marking the onset of my inexorable descent into a realm beyond human reason - weeks have passed whose torments have shackled both heart and mind.

In this time, I have endured things that a sober, clear-thinking mind would dismiss as the hallucinations of an overworked librarian - and surely, but for the few weeks since then, I myself would have done so, when this tale was nothing but a distant nightmare, one to be met with weary smiles or bitter laughter.

Yet now I write these words with trembling hand, driven by the uncanny fear that I am about to lose all footing on the thin boundary separating reality.

I seek no sympathy, nor belief. I know the horror that such words carry - how they sound, how they wound.

But perhaps, just perhaps, this will be read by one who has once glimpsed the unspeakable.

Perhaps such a being might explain what is happening to me - or perhaps this is but my last attempt to stave off madness.

On the day I found the book for a second time - a shadow lurking among the orderly returns, as though it belonged there - I returned it to the archive.

This time, however, with a desperate wish to seal it away, to consign it forever to darkness.

With trembling hands, I cleared space in one of the ancient, heavy archive boxes, removed yellowed files, faded folders, and musty catalogs, laid the book carefully at the very bottom, then piled the old contents back atop it.

I sealed the lid with multiple layers of tape, re-labeled the box, and placed it on the darkest, most remote shelf, buried deep behind forgotten folders untouched for years.

I tried to calm myself. I sought a rational explanation.

Perhaps it was a cruel prank by Lena, who had been here the night before. She had seen how the book disturbed me. Maybe she had sneaked back, pulled it from the archive, and slipped it among the returns - a vile joke meant to drive me mad.

That explanation suddenly seemed so plausible - yes, it had to be!

With this thought, I climbed back up the stairs repeating the story to myself until a sudden anger welled inside me - anger at Lena, for such cruelty.

But then, halfway up the stairs, a sudden shock gripped me, a jolt of cold terror:

Lena had no key.

She always came only in the afternoon, when the library was already open. And she was never alone in the evenings. She needed no key - she could not have entered the archive.

For a brief moment, relief flooded me - but the fragile peace was swiftly shattered.

For the more disturbing question now rose, unavoidable: If not Lena, then who?

I searched for answers in the realm of logic - Mrs. Brandt, perhaps? But she had long left in the evening, oblivious to the book. Practical, dry, precise - no type for such secret games.

My mind began to falter as cold dread knotted my stomach and a film of sweat glazed my brow.

I dragged myself to the reception, collapsed helplessly into my chair, bowed my head onto folded arms - just for a moment, I told myself. Just briefly close my eyes, gain a spark of distance, to find clarity.

Yet the sense that something primordial, something unspeakable, had crept into my life crept like a cold fog deeper into my soul - visible only to my spirit, invisible to the world.

For ten minutes, I sat motionless before slowly pulling myself together and trying to interpret everything rationally.

Perhaps I never actually returned the book to the archive yesterday? That had to be the case! For when I saw it lying among the stacks, the carefully placed note of mine was gone. And in the archive, I had not seen it anywhere.

The past days must have been more exhausting than I admitted to myself. The move, suppressed memories - all weighed heavier on my soul than I had realized.

This thought gave me a deceptive calm. I began scanning the books with sober mind - an ordinary morning in a seemingly ordinary world.

The creak of the heavy entrance doors announced Mrs. Brandt’s arrival before I saw her.

She stopped by the coffee machine, poured herself an espresso, and then came to me.

“Morning, Clara,” she said, taking off her jacket.

“Good morning, Mrs. Brandt,” I replied.

“Been here long?”

I nodded

She placed the scanned books on the cart.

“I had to drive a friend to work this morning, so I came in late,” she explained.

“No problem, Mrs. Brandt.” I replied

We stood silently side by side, each lost in our own world. I scanned, she sorted.

Suddenly she paused, looked at me with unexpected concern: “Are you alright, Clara? You look… tired. And somewhat ill.”

There was a genuine worry in her voice that surprised me.

“Yes, no, I’m fine,” I answered, trying to hide my fatigue.

The morning passed without incident.

In the afternoon, an event with a group of young students brought me new joy - their childlike wonder a bright light.

Locking the library in the evening was routine, uneventful.

On the way home, I almost forgot the dark burden of the book -overshadowed by the banal reality of the day.

But upon entering my apartment, the inconceivable struck me: The same black book lay on my coffee table.

My heart pounded wildly.

How had it come here? Who had brought it?

I approached the couch and picked it up.

I fixed my gaze on the book, its warm, almost living leather feeling in my hand like the beating heart of a foreign monster.

A metallic scent stung my nose again, sharper than before. A faint humming, barely more than a whisper, seemed to emanate from the book.

Cautiously, I opened it.

There was Sarah again - her fate recorded in faded script, captured within a story.

A feeling of being watched crept up my spine like a dark serpent.

Suddenly, a dark suspicion struck me: Someone had to be in my apartment.

I hastily set the book aside, grabbed a knife - my last shield against a danger I could neither see nor grasp.

With heart racing, I searched the small, shadow-filled apartment.

Every corner seemed to swallow me, every darkness seemed to move.

I rummaged through cupboards, looked under the bed, behind the shower curtain — anywhere a being might hide.

But no one was there.

The thought of calling the police arose - but I felt it would be futile.

Then the shattering realization struck like a dagger in my heart: No one had brought the book here.

I cannot explain it - and my mind still wrestles with this - but I felt like I had to return to the couch, take the book again, and sit down.

Slowly, I opened the last page and began to read.

The words described with oppressive precision how Sarah sat in her car, on the way home - a scene so vivid it seared itself into my consciousness like a nightmare.

I read the page to its end, ready to close the book.

But then the unfathomable happened: On the next page, previously blank, new words formed, as if the story itself was growing - like a living, malevolent entity.

With mounting disbelief, I stared at the book, unable to comprehend what I saw.

This could not be.

Yet, inexorably, I read on as Sarah’s journey home unfolded before my eyes - written by a hand that could not be human.

I know not how long I sat there, enthralled by the cursed book, which opened before me like a gate into a foreign reality not meant for mortal eyes. Perhaps three hours. Perhaps more. Time had lost all meaning in that state.

The pages portrayed with absurd, tormenting detail how Sarah came home, carelessly slipped off her shoes, greeted her cat with a soft murmur, prepared a simple meal, and finally settled on her couch, staring into the dim flicker of a poorly tuned television.

I read of the shower, of light flowing over her shoulders like water, and of the silence of her bedroom as she finally lay down to fall into a dreamless sleep.

But I did not merely read.

I was her.

I smelled the dust in her apartment, felt the weight of her cat on my lap, sensed the hot water on my - no, her - skin, and heard the muffled sounds of night through her tilted window.

It was no longer mere reading.

It was a transmission.

An invasion.

A substitution.

Only when she fell asleep could I lay the book aside.

I was exhausted, more than after a day of hard labor, exhausted in a way that can only be described as a draining of the spirit.

I sat motionless, staring at the wall, empty, numb.

Then came the horror.

I, Clara - a rational woman, enlightened and sober - sat with a book that wrote itself, while simultaneously invading the life of a stranger like a ghost unsure whether it was observer or possessed.

The thought was unbearable, precisely because it was so clear.

I knew no one would believe me. Not the police, not my friends, not even myself - if it had happened to another.

I would have laughed at such a tale. But now?

Now I laugh no more.

A sudden thought pierced me like cold electricity: Was Sarah even real? Or was she an illusion of the book, a phantom shaped from alien thoughts, born from nothing?

I had to know.

I knew her full name - the text had named her repeatedly.

I took my phone, hands trembling. The light of the screen hurt my eyes.

I typed her name.

And then… there she was.

An Instagram profile. Public. Unremarkable. A selfie on a balcony. A blurred coastline in the background.

I had never seen that face before. And yet I knew - with a certainty that chilled my blood - that it was hers.

Sarah.

My temples began to throb.

A cruel pain shot through my head, as if something inside me was bursting.

I dropped the phone, staggered to the kitchen, somehow found an aspirin.

But it did no good.

The fatigue did not come as ordinary exhaustion.

It was like a dense fog, heavy, oppressive, blacker than sleep.

I collapsed back onto the couch, and the world sank into a dull, swampy darkness.

And that night, I dreamed for the first time of the archive.

Not our archive.

Another.

Older.

Deeper.

I know not when exactly the dream began - or whether it was a dream at all.

Perhaps it was more a passage, a slipping across, a threshold I crossed when my body sank into sleep on the couch.

I found myself in the midst of a room.

An archive.

But not the semi-modernized archive of my library - no, this one was old. Ancient.

The air was heavy, nearly damp, filled with the acrid scent of dust, leather, and something else I could not name - something like old flesh or deeply buried earth.

The only light came from scattered oil lamps, their flickering glow hanging in murky panes like a tired sun over a dying land.

Shadows crept across the floor, trembling against the walls as if alive.

The walls - if they could be called walls - consisted of endless bookshelves. Massive, worm-eaten wood, unevenly built, twisting like in a nightmare where geometry obeys no rule.

None of the shelves were empty.

They were crammed with books, all alike.

Black leather.

No title. No author.

No hint of content or origin.

I knew without thought, without doubt, that they were the same books as the one I had at home. Only with different content.

They looked like clones.

Embryonic births of an alien consciousness.

I wanted to speak.

To utter a sound.

A call, a word.

But no sound came from my mouth. Only my breath, heavy and shallow.

I looked around.

There was no door.

No windows.

No obvious way out.

Only shelf after shelf, book after book.

No end.

A labyrinth of knowledge no man should ever grasp.

And then - the whispering.

Not loud. No.

Far too soft to comprehend. But omnipresent.

Like a hundred voices crawling through the cracks of the shelves, like breaths between the pages.

They spoke no language I knew. Or perhaps they spoke every language at once.

A whisper of things that existed before time itself.

I shivered.

Not from cold, but from a knowledge lurking behind the whisper.

A feeling that I was seen.

Not watched in the ordinary sense - but penetrated, as if my mind were an open book and something between the shelves was flipping its pages.

I wanted to flee.

But my legs refused to obey.

It was as if the room itself held me - not physically, but like a web spun from meaning, expectation, unavoidable fate.

And then something happened - not seen, but felt:

A movement.

A shadow, not a light interrupted - but darkness intensifying.

Something was there.

Not near. Not yet. But approaching.

My heart raced. I gasped for air.

Panic coursed through me like cold fire.

I wanted to wake. I wanted to scream.

But I was trapped - in the room, in time, in knowledge.

I knew that if I touched even one of those books, I would never wake again.

Never return.

For this was no mere archive.

It was a consciousness.

A place where thoughts were bound. Where souls lay trapped between pages.

And I was but a breath away from becoming the next.

I awoke with a start, as if an invisible hand had torn me from the depths of my consciousness.

My heart hammered wildly against my ribs.

The room was silent, and the dim daylight filtering through the curtains seemed to struggle to pierce a leaden darkness I still felt within my mind.

For a moment, I was paralyzed, caught between dream and reality, my senses reeling, and a nameless dread settled like a heavy veil over my thoughts.

Then my eyes fell upon the coffee table.

There it lay.

The book.

Motionless, as if an ancient being patiently awaited my turning of the next page.

The cover seemed alive in the gloom, pulsating like the skin of a foreign monster.

And as I placed my trembling hands upon the table, I knew the night had shown me more than the limits of reason would allow.

The memories of that endless room, the oil lamps, the dusty shelves, the whispering murmurs - they burned themselves into my soul as if clawed by an invisible talon.

I wanted to rise, to seek the outside world, to force normality - but my limbs were heavy, and the weight of that knowledge pressed upon me like an unseen stone.

My fingers sought my phone.

I sent a message to Mrs. Brandt, my own voice in the text as faint and distant as my spirit: “Mrs. Brandt, I will take the day off today. I do not feel well. - Clara”

The book lay there. Still. Patient.

And I was trapped in its thrall.

I forced myself to rise, shaking off the heavy shadows that clung to me from the night before.

The day was to be calm, I resolved - a day free of toil and obligation, a day of silence and order.

I began with a simple meal, prepared with mechanical motions. The clink of cutlery, the faint sizzle in the pan - small, mundane sounds that briefly tore me from the dark fog that had settled in my mind.

Afterward, I sat before the television and put on an old film, one whose plot I vaguely remembered. The voices and images momentarily captured my thoughts, yet my gaze kept drifting back to that black book on the coffee table.

There it lay, immovable, as if fused to the apartment itself, a living thing, patiently awaiting its hour.

To distract myself, I reached for another book - an innocent novel, far removed from secrets or dark powers. Yet even as I read, a persistent unrest gnawed at me, stirred by the black tome. A tug, a relentless yearning pulling me back again and again.

The harder I tried to resist, the clearer it became - I could not escape it.

At last, as the sun passed its zenith and shadows shortened, I yielded.

With trembling fingers, I lifted the book from the table, opening its heavy cover - felling strangely alive beneath my touch.

The words unleashed themselves like a frigid wind, sweeping through my consciousness.

Sarah sat at her desk, surrounded by the pale glow of flickering neon lights that bathed the room in cold, sterile illumination.

Her hands flew over the keyboard, but she seemed nervous, restless, as if sensing invisible eyes watching her every move.

“Sarah felt watched,” I read - the words simple, yet loaded with a suffocating dread that pierced my very soul.

Her gaze flicked repeatedly toward the door - her shoulders tensed as if bracing for an inevitable assault.

Sarah did not linger long at her desk, the oppressive presence in the air unbearable.

She rose, nervously brushed hair from her face, and moved to the window, staring out at the gray facades of surrounding buildings. The light outside was dull, filtered through a heavy, leaden sky.

A chill filled the room, making Sarah’s skin prickle as if unseen cold seeped outward from within.

She forced herself back to the desk, resuming work on the documents before her.

Again and again she glanced over her shoulder, as if trying to glimpse someone who was not there.

The feeling of being watched clung to her - her heart beat unevenly, her thoughts spun in chaos.

Yet no one was there - only shadows that seemed to move when unobserved.

During her lunch break, she left the office for a small café around the corner and ordered coffee.

Seated at a window table, she tried to focus on the outside scene, but the sensation persisted: Someone - or something - followed her, listening to every word, stalking her steps.

She ate mechanically, appetite absent, often gazing out as sluggish gray clouds lumbered like ancient titans over the city.

Hurriedly, she swallowed the last sip of her cold coffee as the clock announced the end of her break.

She forced herself to rise, stiff limbs reluctant but moving, leaving the café with heavy footsteps.

The clouds now seemed to press even closer, intent on smothering every spark of life.

Back at the office, she sat once more at her desk. Documents awaited her, and though her mind battled the oppressive presence, she worked as if nothing were amiss.

Her fingers danced over the keyboard, but each time she looked up, she flinched - as though a shadow moved at the edge of her vision.

The hours dragged on endlessly. The whispering - silent to all but her - was a constant companion.

No attack came, no tangible threat - only the paralyzing sense that something unspeakable drew near, encircling her.

When the workday ended, Sarah hastily gathered her things. She wanted to reach the safety of her own home as swiftly as possible.

Once inside, she followed her usual routine.

She cooked a simple meal, stroked her cat, which purred softly at her feet, sat on the couch, and turned on the television.

The flickering images offered faint comfort, though her eyes were weary, her mind restless.

After dinner, she took a warm shower, the water seeming to wash the cold shiver from her skin - yet the feeling of being watched endured.

Finally, she lay down, pulling the blanket up to her chin and closing her eyes.

But sleep was no gentle refuge. Within her, a dark dream began to stir.

Just as Sarah’s eyes closed and she sank into the shadowed depths of that dream, I snapped from my trance.

Dazed, I looked about.

The room was draped in the dusky darkness of evening, only the faint glow of streetlights filtering through the windows.

A suffocating stillness hung over the apartment, as though time itself held its breath.

Slowly, I realized I had done nothing else all day but read the book - lost within that alien, disturbing world unfolding relentlessly before me.

I rose, limbs heavy as if shackled by invisible chains.

The apartment felt suddenly empty, colder than before, though nothing seems to have changed.

I went to the kitchen, brewed a cup of herbal tea, took the steaming mug in both hands, and sat in the old armchair by the window.

Outside, the wind whispered softly through the trees, and the muted light of night seemed to lull me.

Despite my exhaustion, I did not wish to sleep just yet.

I stared into the dark cup, struggling to order my thoughts, but the images from the book would not let me be.

Something inside me yearned to regain control - yet the book pulled me back with an inexplicable force.

At last, I set the cup aside, turned off the light, took a shower, and crawled into bed.

The blanket felt heavy upon my shoulders - like the shadows I could not shake.

As I stared into the darkness, sleep slowly enveloped me - but deep within, I knew Sarah’s story and that of this book had only just begun.

I dreamed again the same dream as the night before.

Again, I found myself in that gloomy chamber, its walls lined with endless wooden shelves that stretched silently to an unseen ceiling.

The pale light of old oil lamps cast flickering shadows on the black, leather-bound books resting there - silent, yet brimming with unspeakable secrets.

I looked around, desperate to find an exit, a glimmer of hope - but the shelves seemed to shift, their rows endless, intent on imprisoning me.

A cold breath slipped through the room, and I heard indistinct whispers echoing between the volumes - like an ancient, lost song that gripped my thoughts.

I felt watched, surrounded by something beyond comprehension, something fixing countless eyes upon me though I saw nothing.

A nameless terror crept up my spine, making my limbs tremble.

Yet despite the fear, despite the panic, there was an inexplicable longing that drew me ever deeper into this labyrinth - as if I were not merely a prisoner, but a part of it.

I awoke again with a pounding heart, still dazed and caught between dream and waking.

The book lay beside me, pages spread open as if it had found its own way to me, beckoning me deeper into its baleful thrall.

Unthinkingly, I grasped the book once more and began to read.

A chill ran through me as I saw what was written - something that chilled my blood to ice.

Sarah had dreamed the same nightmare that night.

Deeply disturbed, Sarah reached for a sedative pill, its bitter taste biting her trembling tongue.

The words described how she sensed something was wrong - that the dream was no mere dream, but more like a teleportation to that accursed place.

She struggled desperately to shake the shadow, to organize her life, to begin the day as usual.

Yet a dark premonition slithered like a cold serpent through her thoughts: something dreadful was coming.

In the weeks that followed, I witnessed a womens descend into madness.

That day, I returned to work, determined to maintain normalcy.

But despite my efforts, a leaden weight pressed upon my shoulders.

Unconsciously, I had brought the book with me, hidden deep in my bag.

Again and again, in quiet moments among the shelves and the library’s hushed bustle, I caught my gaze drifting to the black spine, my fingers reaching for the book to read.

Sarah’s condition in the story deteriorated visibly.

She felt ever more pursued, pressed by an invisible presence poisoning her thoughts and entangling her in a web of paranoia and fear.

In my own life, the same oppressive dread spread - a difficult ache in my chest stealing my breath.

I knew instinctively I was the origin of all this - the origin of her paranoia, her fear, her inexorable decay - yet powerless to resist.

I could not set the book aside, could tell no one, and the thought of seeking escape seemed like fleeing an unavoidable truth.

Days passed, each melting into the next in a grim loop.

Again and again, I grasped the book, sinking deeper into Sarah’s world - a realm of terror and growing madness.

Sarah herself began neglecting her work, often sitting still and silent before her computer, glancing anxiously around.

Colleagues noticed the change.

They cautiously asked if she was well, but Sarah gave no answer, no explanation for the darkening cloud that cloaked her.

Her smile grew rare, her eyes dull.

Every encounter exhausted her, and fleeting glances betrayed a fear beyond words.

Then there were the nights - the nights that Sarah and me shared.

Every night, I fell into the same dream, the same dark chamber of the archive.

Sarah entered that dream too, as lost and desperate as I. We shared this place, this mute, oppressive presence that enveloped us and slowly dissolved the boundary between reality and madness.

Our souls were entwined by the book, and with every page I read, Sarah’s decline seemed more inevitable - as if the book itself dragged us both down a spiral of despair and lunacy from which there was no escape.

Between the bleak nights, from time to time, another dream crept into my mind - a dream leading me to a pitch-black room, an endless void where all light was extinguished.

There, before me, lay Sarah - curled and crushed beneath a weight of despair, crying silently, endlessly.

I could do nothing but watch in mute helplessness, trapped as a silent observer.

And whenever I awoke from this vision and reached for the book, it was as though the dark scene reflected in Sarah’s dream.

She had the same dream, witnessed the same torment - only from a different angle.

While I looked down upon her, she lay upon the floor, watched by an overwhelming presence from which she could not flee.

But she could not see me.

With each passing day, Sarah’s decay became more apparent.

The light of her life faded in faint, faltering whispers.

She began avoiding work.

The routines that once carried her through the day crumbled to dust beneath her fear.

Colleagues noted her absence, but she remained silent. Messages went unanswered, calls ignored.

Even eating, once a simple necessity, became a burden.

Her fridge remained unopened, meals untouched.

The cat, once her loyal companion, was forgotten - left unfed and silent witness to her decline.

Sarah spent most days in bed, wrapped in a blanket as heavy as her thoughts.

Her eyes stared blankly at the ceiling as her mind wandered a dark labyrinth of fear and paranoia.

Every movement was effort, every breath a struggle.

A struggle she eventually lost.

That day I had just come home from work.

For some time, I had ceased having dinner - my appetite waned, along with all else within me.

I sank heavily onto the couch and resumed reading.

Before me unfolded the final moments of Sarah’s life.

She stood upon a rooftop, high above the flickering city lights that spread like tiny, cold stars in the darkness.

Tears ran down her face as memories of a former life overwhelmed her - friends, family, the women she once was slowy fading into the husk she was now.

Her weeping was quiet, almost resigned.

Then she leapt.

Her body plunged through the cold night air, her last thoughts inevitably drawn to the archive.

She knew - or believed - that she was becoming part of that dark abyss whose shadows had long loomed over her.

The impact came - a dull, final end.

I felt the familiar warmth of the book slip away, the metallic scent fading into nothingness, as if all life had been drained from its pages.

And before my eyes, the last words of her story emerged slowly, like a creeping mist:

*“The Archivist Below sees...”*
