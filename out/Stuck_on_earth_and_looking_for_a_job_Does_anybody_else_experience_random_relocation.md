Hello, people. I'm back with another update about my self-loathing, jobless, nearing-on-broke existence. My shoulder is doing a little better, thank you very much. I seem to possess unknown regeneration abilities. Not that that'll get me anywhere in life. 

Our doorbell has been broken for a very long time. Instead of ringing, it emits a drawn-out gurgling that still freaks me out every time I hear it. I was watching TV late last night as I couldn't really sleep, and let me tell you, when that awful sound echoed through the emptiness of the apartment, I nearly jumped out of my seat. When I got up to answer the door, I was relieved to find that it was only [Nettie](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) coming to visit. I didn't mention my injury. In fact, I gave her no indication anything out of the ordinary had happened at all. We tuned into a cartoon and sat in companionable silence for a while, but she seemed to have something else on her mind. She kept stealing glances at my profile until I asked her what was up. 

“Well, since you insist! Remember how we talked about dating a little while ago? I’ve been thinking about it and there’s someone I would *love* for you to meet.”

“Are you serious?”

She bit her lip, giving me a shaky grin. “You know, sometimes when your voice is so flat, I can’t tell if you’re mad or not…”

“I’m surprised, that’s all.”

“Interested?” She leaned closer, eyes gleaming.

“Not very much.”

“But he’s amazing! He’s twenty-eight like me, he’s super laid-back, and he’s my cousin! We grew up together. Okay, look. I’m sorry if I overstepped, but… matter of fact, he’s not seeing anyone and he agreed for me to give you his number.” She pulled out a piece of paper and waved it in front of my face. “Here. Come on. Just take it. Take it.”

I sighed and reluctantly snatched the note out of her hand. Elijah. “That’s a nice name.” 

“Yes! It is! And he’s got neat handwriting, too, doesn’t he?”

“I guess.”

“So will you give him a call?”

“You’re being pushy.”

She fell silent and the rest of the night was rather awkward. This morning, Kit woke me up around eight and drove me to an interview that went so bad I don't want to talk about it. I ended up sitting in the empty bathtub at home, fully dressed and staring at the wall for an hour. This lasted until Kit knocked on my door and asked about my day, at which point I began to cry. So I got out and then I somehow ended up typing a number into my phone. Anything to distract myself from this sorry state of affairs. Wiping my eyes and nose, I exhaled deeply before pressing the *call* button.

*"Eli Carter."*

The voice that gave this clipped greeting was deep and warm.

"Hi, this is Evangeline Shirley. Your cousin gave me your number."

*"Well, hey! How are you?"*

“Terrible. And you?”

*“Um… sorry to hear that. So misery does love company, huh? I’m fine. Just got home from work.”*

“Oh, so *everyone’s* got a job now,” I said bitterly. “I got turned down again today.”

A sympathetic hiss of pain came from the other end. *“Damn. Been there; I know it's frustrating."*

My brows rose. I had sort of expected this to throw him off.

*"So, seeing as I'm free and you need some mood improvement, wanna go out to eat?"*

"Hm. With how Nettie's been talking you up, I wouldn't want to let her down."

*"Perfect. Tom's Diner, around eight?"*

I cringed, the image of blond curls flashing through my mind. "Bad idea. Someone… works there."

*"Well, now, Evangeline, that's the case with most places."*

I snorted. "You know what I mean."

*"Okay, so what are we going for here? Fancy place or not so fancy place?"*

"I'm broke, so take a wild guess," I said, smiling at my phone.

*"It'd be my treat."*

"I don't want you spending money on me. We're strangers."

*"Not entirely, we're both close to Nettie. Okay, compromise: how about we get some burgers and sloppily eat them in my car?"*

Much better. I told him to pick me up by the local park, then I got dressed and did my hair. I always wear it in a braid that goes around the back of my head. Nettie taught me how, and for as long as I've had hair, this has been the only acceptable style to me. Thus, I headed out into the cool night air, greedily sucking it into my lungs on my way over to the meetup spot. Elijah was driving a classic Chevrolet Caprice, the seats of which were soft as feathers as I sank down on them.

"I like this car."

Elijah grinned. "It's secondhand and it eats gas like it's Cheetos, but I love it." His closely shaven hair and strikingly broad build almost gave the impression of a military man, contrasted by his open, casual smile. We chatted pleasantly on our way to the local burger place, Eli seeming comfortable in leading the conversation. I appreciated this more than I can say. 

Elijah drove us out to the cliffs to eat. We live near a rugged, windy coast. Come summer, the storms turn into salty breezes and the sun coaxes tons of visitors to the beach, but these days, the weather is still wild and rather unpredictable. I was therefore pleasantly surprised to find that the air was calm and gentle as we got out of the car and sat down on the hood to eat. The spot he'd parked in was overlooking the edge of the ridge and the waves roaring against the rocks below. Crossing my legs, I stuffed a handful of fries into my mouth.

"Nettie doesn't want me eating fast food," I muttered through the taste of spicy potato mush. "She says it's bad for you."

"It is, but it's okay to eat sometimes. Nettie's got some… specific ideas about how things are supposed to be." Eli shrugged, staring up at the dark sky. The moon was hanging over us, bathing the cliffs in its serene white light. "Don't hold it against her. She struggles with that, more than she lets on."

"So what is it that you do?" I had actively avoided the topic of jobs thus far, but I was frankly running out of things to say. 

"I'm a security guard. I used to be on the police force, but… that didn't work out."

"And you've always lived here? How come we only meet now?" I asked.

Eli stayed silent for several beats. "I spent the last couple years in a psych ward. I normally don't tell people that. Not right away. But you kinda look like you'd be okay with that."

"Why wouldn't I be?" I paused. "Also, what's a psych ward?"

Eli's features stiffened. "You're kidding me."

I held his gaze, slowly shaking my head.

"Girl, you are weird." He grinned wearily. "Well, a psych ward is a hospital where you get treated if it's… if it's your mind hurting and not your body."

I frowned. "Why is it such a big deal that you were there?"

"It's not. It shouldn't be. But to some folks it is." He kicked his legs up. "Just one of those things that shouldn't be the way they are. Nevermind. Didn't mean to kill the mood. Speaking of which, you're not that into me, are you?" he inquired casually. 

"No, I like you." I paused. "You're easy to talk to. I like you a lot."

"But this isn't what you want?"

"Correct."

"Do you *know* what you want?"

"Yes." *It [waits tables](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13fnc4u/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_everyone/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) down at Tom's Diner.* "But it might not be a good decision."

"Hey, least you got a general idea. Because I don't. Feels like everyone my age is already married with children or whatever, and meanwhile, I'm sitting here kinda wishing I could *be* a kid again. I wasn't even sure I wanted to go on this date, but I don't know… I'm not regretting it."

I raised a quizzical brow.

"Look, it's like this. You're not really my type, and you definitely have someone else on your mind—but we get along well. That's rare enough, for me at least."

"Me too," I admitted.

"So, do you wanna just hang out?"

I nodded slowly, my lips twitching into a smile. "I know where we can go."

The playground. My idea was the playground. If you've ever been to a playground at night, you'd probably understand. Elijah Carter understood well enough. We had a pretty good time simply messing around on the jungle gym. After about an hour of sitting on the swingset and showing each other random songs we liked, he came up with something much better. We decided to play hide and seek. I texted Kit Sutton to come join us, but we started the first round on our own anyways. Eli volunteered to be the seeker, counting to a hundred while I found a place to hide. I already knew which spot I was going to pick. As soon as he had his back turned to me, I climbed up the big yellow tube slide and crammed myself up in there in the fetal position; far away enough from both the entrance and exit as to not be visible if someone were to peer inside from above or below. 

I heard Elijah finish counting outside and stifled a giggle when he began to wander around outside. He searched in the jungle gym tower, in the bushes near the edge of the grounds; he even looked up the tube slide once but didn't find me. I grinned to myself, heart pounding in giddy excitement. It was fun, until something… changed? 

I was suddenly very aware of how tight this space was. The contorted position I was in began to grow progressively uncomfortable, and now that I was actively thinking about it, the burning pain seemed to increase by the second. Before long, it was shooting up my tendons and stinging my joints. I took note of the beads of cold sweat on my forehead only when I felt them roll down my face. It was then that I decided it was time to give up; I wasn't liking this game anymore. I was about to straighten my body and drop down the slide to freedom when I found that I had lost the ability to move. 

First, I thought my legs had simply fallen asleep. I couldn't get my knees to bend, I couldn't even wiggle my toes. The problem didn't stem from my lower body alone, though. Upon attempting to curl my fingers into fists, I found that they, too, wouldn't budge. Every breath felt like a conscious, deliberate action and the air I desperately tried to suck in through my mouth didn't seem to *arrive* in my chest. That's when the panic set in. I didn't know what was happening to me. I appeared to have lost complete control over my body, and no matter how sharply I commanded myself to comply, I remained rigid, frozen, still. Stuck. 

I wanted to cry out, scream for help, but my lips would not part and my throat refused to produce a single sound. I realized in horror that walls were closing in on me—the tube slide was growing tighter around me. The sturdy yellow material appeared to be pulsing, shivering and contracting. I felt like a small animal that had been swallowed by a snake and was now being digested, the process agonizingly slow and painful. I couldn't hear Elijah outside anymore. In fact, I couldn't hear anything, save for the static throbbing of prolonged silence and a low droning noise coming from afar. 

*Nonononononono.*

Tears began to sting my eyes, blurring my vision. My gaze darted between my motionless hands and my knees, pressed up against my chest. The discomfort was near unbearable. Every nerve in my body seemed to be screaming; I ached to arch my spine, stretch my legs, flex my arms—

And then, completely without warning, they all sprang free. 

The narrow confines of the tube slide had dissolved into nothingness. I found myself lying sprawled out on warm, unfamiliar soft ground; my muscles groaning and my senses singing with relief. I was out. 

*How the fuck had I gotten out?*

I didn't remember moving, I didn't remember anybody coming to rescue me from my hard plastic prison. As my eyes blinked up at the sky, this question was quickly replaced by a harsher, more urgent one. 

*Where even was I?*

I couldn't be at the playground. There was no moon hanging above me, no slides or swingsets anywhere in sight and the nightly darkness had been replaced by a dim, baby blue glow. The light had no singular source and seemed to instead come from all around me, as if the sand I was lying on was somehow emitting it. I raked my fingers through the shining grains and they flowed freely between my digits, acting almost as one liquid entity—more like thick, soupy water than anything else. This place was unlike anything I'd ever seen before. 

Once more, I tipped my head back to look up. There were hues of pink and purple dancing across the heavens, almost spectral in appearance. But there was something else too, something much less pleasant to behold. It was a… splotch. A dark spot, like the silhouette of an object drawing closer from afar. For some reason, I was overcome with a strong sense of familiarity. My throat constricted as cold dread began to seep into my bones. My mind was racing. *What was this place? How did I get here? What was that shadow in the sky, and why did the sight instill such horrified recognition within me?*

And then it hit me. I must have fallen unconscious. This was all a dream, it had to be. I'm normally one to sleep dreamlessly, and nothing like this had occurred the last time I had passed out, but it was the only logical explanation. I threw my head back as a sigh of relief escaped my throat. Now all I had to worry about was waking up again. 

I figured all I could do was wait. I pushed myself up into a sitting position and pulled my knees to my chest, fingers drumming against my calves. My gaze languidly traveled back to the black spot closing in on the odd beach, but I quickly snapped my head back around as a chill ran down my spine. 

*Wake up, wake up, wake up…*

I repeated the phrase over and over again in my head like a mantra, growing more and more nervous when nothing happened. Was it normal to be this aware in a state of unconsciousness? I pressed my eyes shut. If only Nettie were here. She'd be able to make sense of things, ready with gentle words of reassurance and a warm smile. I missed her, missed the comfort of home. My thoughts were running wild again. *Was I ever going to get out of here? I couldn't stay trapped in my mind, right? That was a thing that couldn't happen. And the others, they had to be around, they had to find me at some point…* My fingers began tapping more rapidly, my lips starting to quiver until finally, I *burst*. 

I threw my head back and cried out, howling into the vast expanse of the pastel firmament. 

My vision blurred, and then, all of a sudden, everything turned dark. I felt myself slipping down a hard, smooth surface on my back. The next moment, I was tumbling, rolling onto a rougher surface. The landing was painless, though, and when I let out a weak, confused groan and my eyes fluttered open, I found myself at the bottom of the yellow tube slide and two figures rushing my way from opposite directions. 

"Holy shit!" I recognized my roommate's voice immediately. Too stunned to move, I uttered another meek whimper. Bright blue strands of hair tickled my face as [Kit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13eovqy/im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_also_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) leaned over me, concerned eyes meeting mine. "Eva! Eva, are you alright?"

She was joined by Eli, who without hesitation started to lift my arms and legs one by one, inspecting my body for injuries. Before I could react, he quickly but carefully turned me onto my belly to trace my spine with his fingers. 

"Anything broken?" Kit asked, her voice breathy and anxious. "Is she okay?"

"Seems to be," he mumbled. "Hey! Hey, can you hear us? Say something, talk to me," he ordered sharply.

"I'm here," I pressed out. 

"Where the hell have you been?" Kit hissed, her tone without venom as she pulled me up by the shoulders. "We were looking for you for, like, a whole hour!"

"None of you thought to check in the tube slide, huh?" I muttered, rubbing my forehead. 

The two of them traded bewildered glances. "Uh… actually, we did," Kit replied. "You weren't in there."

"What?" I shot Eli a quizzical look, but he merely nodded.

"You really weren't," he confirmed. The way he regarded me with knitted brows and a tight jaw left no room for doubt—he was telling the truth, or at the very least he was sure of it.

"I actually crawled all the way into it," my roommate supplied. "It was empty."

"But that's where I was hiding! I-I was stuck in there, and I think I passed out because I dreamt I was… somewhere else."

Elijah shook his head in disbelief, scratching his scalp as his throat was visibly working. "I'm out. This is too fucking weird for me. I'm just gonna… I'm out." He swayed slightly as he rose to his feet. "Are you gonna need help getting her home?" he asked Kit.

"Nah, it's fine," she said quietly, staring at the ground beside my head.

"I can walk," I told her, accepting Elijah's hand to pull me up. My knees felt weak and wobbly, but I managed to place one foot in front of the other without issue as I took a couple tentative steps. We parted ways with Eli, Kit holding the door of her old station wagon for me as I slid into the passenger seat. She wordlessly took her place behind the wheel. 

"Can't believe this. When you texted me, I was really looking forward to goofing off, actually. And now, I just… I just don't get it. I don't understand what happened to you." The words came bubbling out of her as the car engine sputtered to life. 

"Me neither," I answered absently, still feeling as though I wasn't quite awake.

"This is a first?"

"Yeah."

Kit exhaled, whipping her hair back. "Okay… On the bright side, Nettie's cousin seems nice. They've kinda got great looks running in the family, don't they?"

"If you say so."

"Well, Nettie's, like, the prettiest girl ever for sure so… I mean… nevermind. Guess what, I actually had lunch at Tom's Diner today."

My brows shot up. "You did?"

"The waiter asked about you. Seems he's seen us together before. He wanted to know if you were alright and if you'd be coming back to the diner anytime soon."

"What did you say?"

Kit let out a short laugh. "Actually, I told him to grow a pair and ask you himself; he's got your number after all. But I think he didn't want to. Seemed kinda nervous." She paused. "I guess I'd be, too. You can be pretty intimidating."

"The effect is unintentional."

"I know, Eva. So… maybe now you'll tell me what happened between you two?" 

I didn't, but I showed her my previous post when we were at home. It left her rather confused, to say the least. These things just keep piling up, it seems. I don't know what to make of any of it, and neither does Kit. Maybe Nettie will be able to make sense of this when I tell her. If I tell her. I'm still rather unsettled. At this point, how I'm supposed to find a job between all this is beyond me.
