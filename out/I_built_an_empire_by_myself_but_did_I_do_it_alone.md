I came from nothing. You hear stories like mine all the time, but people rarely understand what it means to really start from the bottom. Life? It’s unfair from the get-go. We’re all born different. Some have wealth, connections, safety. Others, like me, have to claw through the mud just to get a glimpse of the surface. I wasn’t handed anything. Every opportunity, I had to fight for. I had to outthink, outlast, and outmaneuver people who, quite frankly, had no right to be in the same room as me.

But that’s the thing about life. It doesn’t care if you deserve better. It only responds to power—whether that’s money, influence, or fear. I learned that early. You work your way up, or you stay down. So, I worked. Ruthlessly. Sleepless nights, backstabbing deals, lies that I told myself were just part of the game. And now, here I am, in my penthouse—high above the city I once had to beg from. It’s funny how things change, how money warps your reality.

I was sitting on the balcony last night, looking out at the skyline, the lights twinkling like stars. The city below moved like clockwork, oblivious to the sacrifices that had been made for me to rise above it all. People were just dots, ants scurrying in their little lives. For a moment, I felt invincible. Nothing could touch me. Not anymore.

After I went to bed, I don’t know when I drifted off. The bed was too comfortable, and the exhaustion too heavy. But then, I found myself somewhere I wasn’t supposed to be.

It was a grand white mansion, not the White House as I first thought, but something far more elaborate, almost surreal in its perfection. The walls gleamed like polished ivory, the marble floors stretched endlessly, reflecting the overhead chandeliers that sparkled like stars. The architecture was impossibly grand, the kind of opulence that felt out of place, like it had been plucked from some distant dream world. Everything around me was pristine, untouchable, and the people—if you could call them that—were all dressed in sharp suits, their faces blurry, their movements robotic, almost lifeless. Their voices were a distant hum, as if I was underwater, unable to grasp a single word they said.

I moved through the crowd, feeling their cold presence closing in on me, suffocating me. I needed space, air. I slipped away, down a long hallway lined with towering columns and intricate golden patterns etched into the walls. The further I went, the quieter it became, the distant hum of voices fading, replaced by a creeping silence that made the hairs on my neck stand up. It felt wrong—like I wasn’t supposed to be there. But I kept moving, unable to stop, as if something was pulling me deeper into the mansion’s endless halls.

That’s when things started to change.

The walls around me began to darken, the pristine white corridors turning black, like wet tar slowly oozing down from the ceiling. The lights above flickered, then died, plunging me into near-complete darkness. All that remained was a faint red glow at the end of the hall, pulsing like a heartbeat, calling to me. My breath quickened. I turned to look back, but the way I had come was gone—just an endless void stretching into nothingness. Panic set in, but I couldn’t stop walking. My legs moved on their own, dragging me toward that red light, like a moth to a flame.

I tried to run, but my body felt heavy, like I was moving through quicksand. The shadows around me twisted and writhed, closing in with every step. No matter how fast I tried to go, the hallway seemed to stretch on forever, the red light always just out of reach.

And then, I heard it.

A soft, scratching sound, like claws dragging against stone. It came from above. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. Slowly, I looked up—and that’s when I saw it.

The creature.

It was hanging from the ceiling, its long, gangly limbs stretched out like a spider. Its skin was raw, burned, as if it had been torn apart and pieced back together in some grotesque fashion. Thick black ooze dripped from its body, splattering onto the floor. Its face—or what was left of it—was a distorted mask of horror. One eye was hollow, an empty void, while the other glowed with a sickly green light. Its mouth was stretched wide, too wide, lined with jagged, broken teeth that looked like they’d been sharpened to points.

And then it smiled. A slow, sickening grin that revealed more of those razor-sharp teeth, dripping with black tar. My stomach churned, but before I could move, it dropped down in front of me, landing soundlessly. Its long, skeletal arm lashed out, gripping my right arm with its clawed hand. The pain was instant, sharp, as it yanked me off the ground, holding me up like a helpless puppet.

I dangled there, face-to-face with the creature. Its breath was hot and foul, like something that had been rotting for centuries. It tilted its head, studying me with its glowing green eye, its grin never faltering. 

And then, in a voice that sounded like nails on a chalkboard, it spoke.

"You forget who made you what you are," it hissed, its voice dripping with malice. "Time’s up."

Its claws dug deeper into my arm, slicing through the skin. I screamed, or at least I tried to, but no sound came out. The air was thick, suffocating, and I could feel myself slipping away, the creature’s twisted grin the last thing I saw before everything went black.

I woke up with a jolt, gasping for air, drenched in sweat. My heart was pounding, my skin clammy. It took a moment for the room to come into focus, but when it did, I looked down at my right arm—and froze.

There, on my skin, was a mark. Three long, jagged lines, like claw marks, red and angry. I could still feel the sting of the creature’s grip, the echo of its voice ringing in my ears.

I reached for my phone, my hands trembling, and checked the footage from my bedroom’s security camera. What I saw made my stomach twist.

The video showed me tossing and turning violently in my sleep, clutching my right arm just as I had in the dream. But at the exact moment the creature had grabbed me, I shot upright, my face twisted in terror, and stared straight ahead—right into the camera.

But it wasn’t me. My eyes—they were glowing, just like the creature’s.

The dream wasn’t just a dream. It had left something behind. And whatever it was, it wasn’t finished with me.
