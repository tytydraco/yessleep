I came from nothing. You hear stories like mine all the time, but people rarely understand what it means to really start from the bottom. Life? It’s unfair from the get-go. We’re all born different. Some have wealth, connections, safety. Others, like me, have to claw through the mud, just to get a glimpse of the surface. I wasn’t handed anything. Every opportunity, I had to fight for. I had to outthink, outlast, and outmaneuver people who, quite frankly, had no right to be in the same room as me.

But that’s the thing about life. It doesn’t care if you deserve better. It only responds to power—whether that’s money, influence, or fear. I learned that early. You work your way up, or you stay down. So, I worked. Ruthlessly. Sleepless nights, backstabbing deals, lies that I told myself were just part of the game. And now, here I am, in my penthouse—high above the city I once had to beg from. It’s funny how things change, how money warps your reality.

I was sitting there last night, looking out at the skyline, the lights twinkling like stars. The city below moved like clockwork, oblivious to the sacrifices that had been made for me to rise above it all. People were just dots, ants scurrying in their little lives. For a moment, I felt invincible. Nothing could touch me. Not anymore.

I don’t know when I drifted off. The bed was too comfortable, and the exhaustion too heavy. But then, I found myself somewhere I wasn’t supposed to be.

A White Mansion. The mansion stood grand and imposing, its walls gleaming a pristine white under the dim light, almost too perfect, too untouched by time or nature. Tall columns flanked the entrance, supporting an expansive balcony that overlooked a sprawling courtyard. The windows were large, but dark, offering no glimpse inside, as if the building itself was guarding secrets within. The air around it felt still, unnaturally quiet, as though the mansion existed in a world of its own, separate from the one just beyond its iron gates. I was walking through it like I belonged there, surrounded by people dressed in sharp suits, their faces blurred, their voices distant murmurs. I didn’t know what I was doing there, but it felt important, like I was supposed to make some kind of decision. But as I continued walking, I felt the need to get away from the crowd. It was like they were suffocating me. So, I slipped out, away from the noise, down a long corridor.

That’s when things started to shift.

The walls around me began to darken, the pristine white halls of power fading into something more sinister. They turned black, slick, like wet tar. The lights flickered, then died, leaving me in almost complete darkness, save for a faint red glow at the end of the hallway. My breath quickened. I turned to look back, but there was nothing—just an empty void where I had come from. Panic set in, but I couldn’t stop walking. It was as if my feet were dragging me forward, toward that red light.

Then, it appeared.

The creature. It slithered from the shadows, its form a writhing mass of twisted flesh, like something that had been melted and reshaped by fire. Its eyes—if they were even eyes—were hollow, glowing with a faint, sickly green. And its voice... that voice, deep and guttural, like it came from the depths of something far older than time itself.

"You forget who made you what you are," it hissed, its words slithering through the air like poison. "Time’s up."

I tried to move, to run, but my body wouldn’t listen. The creature was on me in an instant, its foul breath choking the air around me. I could feel its claws digging into my skin, as if it was trying to pull something out of me, something I didn’t even know was there. I struggled, fought with everything I had, but it was like fighting a nightmare you couldn’t wake from. Every moment was more suffocating than the last, and just when I thought it was over...

I woke up.

I was drenched in sweat, my chest heaving, gasping for air. I was back in my bed, in my penthouse, the city lights still twinkling innocently outside. But that dream—it felt too real, too close.

And I couldn’t shake its words. "You forget who made you what you are."

I stared out at the city for a long time after that. Maybe I had forgotten. Maybe that’s why the dream had come. Or maybe... maybe it was something more. Something reminding me that no matter how high I climbed, the darkness I had left behind was always lurking, waiting for the right moment to pull me back down.
