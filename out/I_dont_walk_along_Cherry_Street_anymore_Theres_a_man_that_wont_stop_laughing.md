I don’t know why I’m posting this. My head is throbbing still and I’m nursing my headache with whiskey and mushrooms and trying my best to dissociate. And I’m trying to decide whether or not we’re going to move, my wife and me. I don’t think it’s safe in this town anymore. But if I don’t write this down, if I don’t let someone know what happened to me, then he’ll win. And then your town may fall into a green Hell too. Don’t try to find me, and don’t try to find out where I am. I haven’t used any real names here, and I’ve changed all—most—of the street names too. Cherry Street is the sole exception. There’s a lot of streets by that name all over the country and… changing it feels dangerous in a way I can’t explain.

I’ve made it a habit, lately, to go for walks—sometimes in the evening, sometimes in the early morning, and on a few spectacularly rare occasions, in full dark, when the moon and the stars are my only constant companions. I find the walk invigorates me. It gives me time to think, whether to plan my day, work out a job-related issue, or just to take in some music or a podcast. And, truth told, to lose the spare tire I’ve been carrying since college.

Where I take my daily jaunts is a bit aways from my house, which sits at the zenith of a long hill. But the neighborhood at the bottom is flat, structured, and best of all quiet. There’s little beyond the occasional whir of a lawnmower to interrupt my thoughts. And the houses themselves are beautiful, if not particularly large.

I’m not the only one that likes to traipse the roads that wind uncaringly through the countryside, either. There has come to be, in the past several months, a rotating cast of characters with whom I’ve become quite familiar, by face if not by name. A teenager with down syndrome that tended to cast his gaze downward whenever anyone passed by, humming atonally under his breath. A couple walking their dachshund up and down Cherry Street (and never beyond that). An old man with a John Deere hat perched on hair that had gone milk white. All of these and more were frequent sights as I made my way around the neighborhood, sometimes nodding as I went by, more often making a single, acknowledging glace before leaving them behind me.

Animals, too, were a frequent sight as I passed yard after yard on my treks. There was a cairn terrier that yipped frantically as I passed, an American Eskimo with strawberry red fur on one paw from chewing at itself that stared stoically at me until I looked back, at which point he’d run for the door, barking all the while. There was a fenced-in yard with a husky and a corgi in it, and the two tended to ignore me as they pranced and cavorted around each other. A pregnant stray cat peered out at me with weary eyes, her bulbous belly almost ready to push out more strays into the world. They were all familiar to me, and even now the thought of them brings a smile to my face.

That day, I had decided to take my walk late in the evening, assured that the sun would set just as I was cresting the hill that led to my home. My stomach was full of cheap beer and expensive steak, and I was itching for the chance to work it off a bit before bed. My wife, as always, kissed me goodbye, reminding me to be careful and pressing my pocket knife into my hands. “For protection,” she had said, and I took it with humor. Because the area was *safe*, you understand? I had nothing to fear.

Down the hill I went, listening as the chirps of birds were replaced by those of crickets, as the sky began to dim and the trees began to blur together in one dark, green smear. But there was still light as I reached the bottom, walked cautiously across the road, and onto my usual walking path. I stretched and took a moment to tie my shoes, and then walked on.

There were three churches in that neighborhood stuck in each one of three streets that made it up. On Cherry Street was a run-down little presbyterian chapel, a sign out front proclaiming, “J sus i Kin !” I kept waiting for more of the letters to rub off, curious what combination of gobbledygook would be there to greet parishioners, but had thus far been disappointed. A nice brick Baptist church was parked on the corner of Willow Road and Clark Avenue, complete with a large parking lot and a tall basketball hoop, this last frequently visited by a gaggle of teenagers, the arrhythmic whap of the ball on the ground gaining an almost-musical quality after a while. Finally, there was a Methodist Church at the far end, close to the main road, on Orchid Street. I’d actually been inside once or twice, although the preacher there left a bad taste in my mouth, and I haven’t been back since.

The first church, the one on Cherry Street, was the first I would reach on my usual route, and it was the only one against which I would lean as I cast my gaze down the road. Cherry Street had been named, as near as I could tell, for the number of black cherry trees that lined its length, almost thirty by my sloppy count. They had certainly been there for as long as I could remember, their stature lording over the houses and spilling leaves across the road in the fall.

The sight was breathtaking in the summer, with the views of the houses nearly obstructed by a tunnel of green. In the spring, they’d bloom, producing small clusters of white and yellow flowers, their scent carrying on the breeze so strongly I could almost smell them from the moment I left my house. And in the autumn, the leaves turned such a bright shade of orange that the street itself appeared to be on fire, the whispering of leaves easily mistaken for the whoosh of fire.

Cherry Street was the best part of my walk, and the only portion where I found myself really *looking* at my surroundings, and not just looking but *seeing*, and so I saw the Laughing Man even before I heard him, his jovial chortles growing out of the rustling leaves like pokeweed.

He came thumping up the road wearing worn out sneakers, the kind that lacked any brand insignia on the side (only $19.99 at your local Walmart!). His jeans had faded at the knees and had worn thin on the inside thighs from the friction of his mountainous legs rubbing together. A shirt the color of the very leaves around him bore an image of a bear wearing sunglasses seated at a piano. “Blind Bear Café,” it read in bold red lettering. There were sweat stains in the armpits and beneath his sizeable breasts, and as he marched along, arms pumping left to right, the shirt would slide up, exposing his generous gut. But his size didn’t catch my attention, nor his worn-out clothes. It was his laugh.

It sounded joyous, but not the kind of gut-wrenching laughter that would come when someone told a particularly outrageous joke. Just the sweet, good-natured chuckling two friends who hadn’t seen each other in years might share over an order of onion rings and a couple of beers. And matched with his face—round, but handsome, like a cross between Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson—he put a slight grin on my face too.

By the time he’d caught up with me—he on his side of Cherry Street and me on mine—I was moving again, fixing to beat the sunset back home. I looked out at him, suddenly inspired to a rare interaction with one of my fellow Walkers, and called, “What’s so funny, man?”

He turned and his laughter ceased. He was still smiling as he fixed his gaze on me, but something, some prickle on the back of my neck, made me uneasy. But then he was laughing again, and the feeling vanished so quickly that I wondered if it was there at all. His large frame jiggled to the corner of Cherry Street and Willow Road and then he turned left and was swallowed by the trees.

I thought perhaps I’d see him again as my route took me to the other end of Willow Road, but when I’d reached it, the Laughing Man was nowhere to be found. Perhaps, I thought, he lived in one of the houses there, though I’d never seen him before in the months that I’d been walking around the neighborhood. Perhaps he’d cut through a yard and wandered into the woods behind Clark Avenue, traversing an old trail I didn’t know about. But in the end, any thoughts of the Laughing Man and his peculiarities were pushed from my mind. After all, he was just another Walker. And we each kept to our own.

I didn’t think about him again until the next day, when I’d decided to go walk straight after work, with the stun still blazing down on my back. I didn’t expect to see him again, as unlike me, most Walkers seemed content to do their meandering at the same time each day. And I wasn’t disappointed. Except for the man I thought of as Nipples (for he never wore a shirt whenever I saw him) trimming his hedges, there wasn’t a soul to be found in the neighborhood but for myself and Cross-Eyed Mary, an old mutt woofing at me half-heartedly from behind her fence.

As I sometimes did when I would go walking, I changed sides of the road, this time walking along the right side of each street. For variety, I suppose, although little ever changed but whose mailboxes I would need to veer around as I went. But then I spied something peculiar as I walked over the rough gravel and cracked pavement lining the excuse for a sidewalk which bore me—footprints. At least, they looked like footprints. But they were *growing*.

Left foot and right foot, each print had sparse blades of grass growing out of the ground. Even over tiny bits of gravel and on the concrete itself. It wasn’t at all obvious that they *were* footprints—there was barely enough grass to even *suggest* this, but it stuck in my mind as the only possible solution. But how? And then I remembered the last person I’d seen walking this road, wide but shuffling gait beating on the pavement to some jerky, arrhythmic beat—The Laughing Man. And I thought. And I wondered.

I brought it up to my wife when I returned home—not just the footprints, but the man himself. I described hi—a tall, jolly black giant ambling along, arms flailing about as only the most morbidly obese seem to do, chuckles rumbling out of a mouth stuck in a perpetual grin. It was a little weird, I told her.

“Maybe he was listening to something,” she had said. “A comedy podcast or stand-up or something.” When I told her that there was nothing in his ears, she paused. “Maybe he only had one earbud in,” she offered. “So he could still hear traffic.”

Maybe, I thought. It fit. But then I brought up the footprints and the grass that seemed to rise out of them like tiny green flames. And she put a hand up to her hair to twirl a strand of it around her finger in thought. “You said he might have gone into the woods, right? He’d have had to go through a yard to do it. Maybe he walked through someone’s yard before and picked up grass seed on his shoes and kind of left it behind as he walked. Or just old lawn clippings that *looked* like grass growing.”

Maybe, I thought again. That fit too. One earbud in and a habit of trespassing and collecting grass seed on the bottoms of his worn-out sneakers. That was a thought. It was sensible. Occam’s razor, I thought that was called. But it didn’t *feel* right. I had been certain that when the man turned to look at me there had been nothing in his ears but my greeting. And the grass—that wasn’t clippings, I was certain. It was *growing* out of the concrete. And as far as I knew, that just wasn’t possible.

It was another two days before I saw the Laughing Man again, and when I did, something seemed to have shifted. In the interim, I had noticed the grass in those footprints growing thicker, like someone had poured fertilizer on the spot. The concrete seemed chipped there, and there was even a dandelion rising from one of the footprints too. On the day I saw that man again, I barely even noticed the grass anymore. I was far too focused on *him.*

I had reached the church on Cherry Street and was leaning against it again, looking down the verdant tunnel that stretched invitingly along the road, enveloping it in welcoming green velvet. I thought to count the trees again (although I usually eventually gave up), when I saw him, shucking and jiving up the way. Was he dancing?

No, although there seemed to be a bit more pep in his step that day. He was almost skipping up the street, sporting a different shirt this time—still green, but featuring a pot leaf wearing sunglasses and the slogan, “Why be high on life when you can just be high?” The sweat stains were even more severe, drenching his back and the sides of his great gut. He seemed a little thinner now, I thought.

His laugh was the same as ever though, a pleasant chortle that nonetheless sent shivers down my spine. I couldn’t explain it, only that the laugh seemed false, a ham-fisted façade to mask… what, exactly? This time, as he passed me, I made the point of waving to him, hoping to get him to turn his head so I could see, for certain, if he was wearing an earbud. Hoping to prove that I was just being paranoid.

“Hello again, buddy,” I called, trying to keep the nervous edge out of my voice. “Still laughing, eh?” And then, with a thought both sly and breathtakingly stupid: “Whatever you’re listening to must be pretty funny.”

The laughing ceased again, as he turned to face me; there was certainly nothing in his ears, I noticed. I expected a puzzled look, like he was confused that he was supposed to be listening to anything but the rustle of trees and what-was-I-stupid? But instead, he just fixed his gaze on me, smile sloughing off his face like a snake discards its old skin. His eyes were green, I saw now. The poison yellow-green of a dart-frog. And they looked hateful.

Then, as quickly as that look came, it was gone, replaced by his relaxed smile. The silence, oppressive as I realized that I couldn’t hear anything—no lawn mower, no birds, no insects, was replaced by his charming chuckling and he was off, disappearing around the bend where Cherry Street met Willow Road, with nothing in his wake to denote he’d been there but my own rapidly beating heart.

I stood there for a great long while, leaning against the church’s wall, staring through the trees as though I might still catch sight of him. But I didn’t, and when my phone rang, it was my wife wondering where the Hell I was, as it was almost twenty minutes past when she expected me back. I swore to myself and turned to leave, casting my glance one more time at the sidewalk on the other side of the road.

It wasn’t really much of a sidewalk, I thought. More like just the place where the road met the grassy yards of the neighbors, broken up here and there by thick chunks of what *might* have been a sidewalk once. *Had* there been a full sidewalk here before? I thought back. Certainly not since my wife and I had moved in. But there was a tickle in the back of my head like something wasn’t quite right with the situation. I wondered.

For the next week I didn’t see him, didn’t see any sign of him bustling up the side of the road, bopping along to music that wasn’t there. I had started to wonder if, perhaps, he was nothing more than a hazy hallucination, born of the ninety-degree heat that seared the pavement and made even the most stalwart dogs pant and whine for water. But I knew I’d seen him. I knew that laugh that seemed at once cheerful and crazed; the bubbly, joyful smile was just a sewer grate barely covering the reeking depths below.

And then one day I saw him again. It was early one Saturday morning—early enough that very few people would be out and about, especially on the weekend. But it was set to rain all day and I was determined to go for my walk before the road disappeared under a deluge of water. I woke up early enough so as not to wake my wife, wolfed down a piece of toast and a couple not-quite-done eggs, and started my walk, choosing a different route this time for variety’s sake.

To my great surprise, one of my fellow Walkers was out—the guy I thought of as Jebediah for the wide-brimmed straw hat he always wore and the almost neanderthal brow that sported beneath it two watery brown eyes that spoke little of intelligence. He nodded at me as I walked by, and I nodded right back—the only communication we ever shared. He was walking in the opposite direction, and if I knew his route (I did, I knew everyone’s usual routes by now), we would pass again on Cherry Street.

And, sure enough, I saw him again, rounding the bend just as I took my usual spot against the wall of the Presbyterian church. I could smell the rain in the air and judged I might have just enough time to get home before the sky opened up and vomited its watery payload all over town. There was Jebediah—or Jeb, I supposed—at the far end of town there, making his slow, confident way up the side of the road, stepping through grass that had grown thick there; there really should be a sidewalk, I remember thinking.

I smiled when I saw my Walker friend. Like the rest of them, he and I could share this one, specific thing, and even if we never really spoke to each other, there was still a quiet understanding between us, like the mutual respect of two hunters passing each other in the forest on their ways to bag their respective kills. It was a connection, I suppose.

But that smile faded as I saw the Laughing Man coming up behind him. He seemed to positively melt out of the trees as he shucked and jived up the side of the road, belting out his austere chortling. He looked even thinner now, like he’d lost another fifty, sixty pounds since the previous week. And I wondered if he’d even eaten since I’d last saw him. He wore a brown shirt with a picture of a football on it and writing too worn to be legible. He was walking faster than I thought he could; he would certainly overtake Jeb before long.

His shoulder collided with the straw-hatted man, knocking him to one side as the Laughing Man continued his solitary shuffle, chuckling to himself as he went.

“Hey. Hey!” Jeb called out to him. “What the fuck is the matter with you? Did you not see me there, you tubby black fuck!?”

The laughing ceased. I felt a dark churning in my gut as I watched the Laughing Man turn around, that crazed smile never leaving his face. He regarded Jeb with a single glance before, incredibly, the laughing began again in earnest. I could see the disturbance on my fellow Walker’s face as he realized what I’d known all along; the Laughing Man wasn’t right. There was some kind of stark sickness, some heavy *wrongness* with him. From far away, I couldn’t see his eyes, to know what it would be like to have that wrongness fill my entire field of vision, but I quaked at the thought.

A hand shot out and gripped Jeb’s throat. The laughing grew louder. Eyes that immediately widened from the shock of such a sudden and frightful act quickly flashed to anger, and then fear. The Laughing Man’s grip was iron. Jeb thrashed his head back and forth, arms coming up and raking along that hand, clawing feebly. If he cried out or made a single noise of protestation, I couldn’t hear it; the laughter covered all. 

There was a charge in the air, almost electric. I could feel the hair all over my body rise to attention. There was the malodorous stench of ozone in the air. I decided to flee the scene, tried to turn, realized I couldn’t. My eyes refused to close; I wasn’t sure I was even still blinking.

The Laughing Man’s arm rose, and Jeb along with it. Slowly, slowly, until only his toes remained on the ground, like a macabre ballet dancer standing en pointe. Then, incredibly, his feet left the ground. The Laughing Man’s chuckle seemed to resound in the leafy tunnel that was Cherry Street as Jeb rose higher, higher. His fingers groped, slapped at the Laughing Man’s face, seeking purchase there to annoy, to hurt, to convince the black giant, now so much like some fierce god, to release his tortured neck.

Then something thin but jagged emerged from Jeb’s throat. Sweat stood out on my forehead as I realized, incredulously, that it was a stick, from which a single, verdant leaf sprouted. The Laughing Man was turning now, his back to me as he swung Jeb around with no more difficulty than a child with a ragdoll, stalking forward to the nearest lawn and suspending him over it almost expectantly. Still laughing. Always laughing. I wondered if the occupant of that house was crouched inside, as frightened and unable to move as I at the scene unfolding before us.

Jeb had turned his attention to the stick (no, *branch*) that was still sliding smoothly out of his mouth. He snapped the first twig off of it, gripped the thicker branch, and pulled, tugged, *wrenched* at it, but to little effect. One of his shoes dropped off and I could see a network of brown-white tendrils sliding out of his toes. Roots. Then a hand shot to his eye, and my stomach turned as, between his trembling fingers, another branch shot out between them, the green leaves stained red with sticky blood and eye gore. I was going to be sick, but not even my stomach was empowered to move in this maddening spell I was under.

The Laughing Man carried on as Jeb’s arms began to rise, as nails were ripped from their beds to allow more branches, more leaves, to erupt from their fleshy prison. He turned his palms skyward as if to seek supplication from God Himself. I was suddenly aware of the church behind me, and I wondered wildly how the Creator could allow this horrid, frightening vision to continue.

But it was almost over. Jeb had ceased his struggling as his skin rippled and sloughed off, rough brown bark replacing it. His shirt was shredded as his chest widened, becoming a thick, solid trunk. The Laughing Man’s terrible voice had been joined by the groaning of swelling wood. He didn’t need to hold Jeb’s neck anymore. What remained of my fellow Walker was now quite literally rooted to the spot, the tendrils of roots from his feet greedily spearing into the ground beneath him. His pants split at the crotch and his belt tore apart. A few more seconds, and it was done. A massive black cherry tree stood before the Laughing Man now, surrounded by scraps of fabric and two torn-up shoes resting against the trunk.

The spell was broken. A low whine escaped my lips as the Laughing Man turned, and I could see he had grown fat again, as if he had just eaten and eaten well. His eyes met mine and even from that distance I could see how they glowed, no longer the toxic yellow-green that promised poison, but brightly pulsed a deep, vile green that made me think of radioactivity and bioluminescent fungi. His laughter was still that same, even volume, laughing at a joke I was only now beginning to get. He took a step toward me and I broke.

I turned and ran, fearing as I went that the Laughing Man’s slow, easy amble would quicken into a full sprint to catch me, to *change* me like he’d done to Jeb. A painful throbbing thrummed under my left temple, sending streaks of pain through me. I ran heedless of that pain, crossed the main road, only narrowly dodging a battered Ford pickup truck. The driver laid on the horn as I passed, but I couldn’t hear it. Not over the sounds of laughter that I could still hear, still feel inside my head, a perverse invasion that blotted out all else.

I thundered up my road, one so cracked and broken that I very nearly fell. And if I had, I was certain I would have stayed there, my flesh turned to bark, my hair to leaves. Perhaps berries would grow from branches and the birds would eat me, bit by bit.

I didn’t fall. I didn’t slow. I raced up my driveway and threw open the door. My dogs howled and barked. My wife thundered in, her face a mix of shock and worry as she saw me, as she considered my haunted, pale face and wild eyes and heaving stomach and trembling limbs. She asked me what happened. What was wrong? I fell into her arms and wept.

That was the end of my daily sojourns to that neighborhood. And especially to Cherry Street. I put in time off requests to my job so I could spend the next week at home, still fearful that the moment I left, the Laughing Man would be waiting for me with a twinkle in his too-green eyes and his belly jiggling with that austere laughter. My wife got the sordid story out of me the very next day, and while I don’t think she believed me (I think she thought I’d had a mental break), she supported me, treating my week off like a well-deserved mental health break.

I was able, by the end of that week, to force my feet to carry me over the threshold of my home and out to the car. And slowly, gradually, my life resumed its normal course. I still walk, of course; it’s good for me, and for my still-shrinking waistline, but I do it at the gym, on a treadmill. The sweet perfume of grass and wildflowers has been replaced by the stink of sweat and disinfectant, the sounds of birdsong replaced by grunts and the clang of weights. But that’s a small price to pay to keep me away from there. Away from *him*.

I did go back to Cherry Street eventually, of course. For closure, my much-needed therapist told me when I finally worked up the nerve to recount this tale to her too. I didn’t go on foot, however. Even if it was only the thickness of a windshield that separated me from the outside, I felt infinitely safer in the seat of my S-10.

The street was still there. The same, dilapidated houses devoid of occupants. The same overgrown driveways. The same abandoned church covered with poison ivy and Virginia Creeper vines. I stopped in front of the house before which the tree which had once been Jeb stood. I felt another throb start beneath my left temple.

You see, I remember what happened that day. I remember which lawn the Laughing Man had chosen to make Jeb’s grave. But I also remember that exact tree having always been there, having actually leaned against it once to tie my shoes. I remember those houses having well-manicured lawns and braying dogs. Remember the cars filling the lot of the church on Sunday. I remember a sidewalk. But I also remember Cherry Street like this; abandoned—peaceful, yes, but devoid of all life save that of plants. What happened? What was *still* happening?

I looked onward at the great number of black cherry trees lining the street. Almost fifty, I counted, and a shiver worked up my spine. My lips parted, and I thought I was going to weep again. But I was surprised by the wild, horrible, senile sounds that came sputtering from my cracked lips.

I was laughing.
