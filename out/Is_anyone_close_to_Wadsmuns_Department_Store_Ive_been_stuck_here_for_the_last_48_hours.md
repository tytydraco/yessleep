Hello Reddit,

I'm currently writing this to you from Wadsmuns Department Store in Seattle. Could someone contact their Head Office or something? Now while I can't call this an 'emergency' per say, I am starting to get a little bit uncomfortable. I admit, at first it was fun, having this entire place to myself, but, by now I'm just done with it. I really just want to get out of here and go home.

Two days ago I decided I would check out Seattle. I'm from out of state and it's always been a dream of mine to visit. Well, it still is because I've only planned to stay here for three days and I've been in this store for the entire time. I know... it's ridiculous. I'm starting to realize that this situation is little weirder than I initially... I haven't been thinking clearly.

I got into the city and was making my way though downtown. I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this but for some reason I figured shopping would the best way to start exploring this new amazing city... I know, materialism is bad okay.

The were just something about the building, from the outside it looked incredible. I've never heard of Wadsmuns before but I was really impressed. At least, I was before I realized I literally cannot find the exit.

So I should say, yes, of course I've tried calling for help. The phone reception here is junk. I called 911 after having a melt down a few hours ago and they sounded like they were underwater and just kept asking if I was on the line.

I've retraced my steps multiple times, but the thing is I was certain the entrance lead into the clothing department and segued into decor and then the tools section, but, I've circled that part of the store like twenty times and... well it's just not there. I was like 99% sure it was though because when I entered I noticed this really nice sweater, which is still there on the rack... but there are no doors there. It's just empty wall, which tbh is kind of weird now that I look at it.

I'm kind of trying not to panic because like, I'm just in a department store, it's not like I'm lost in the woods or something so I don't want to be irrational but at the same time it's really getting weird. I know what you are thinking, well can't I just ask someone to help me out? The thing is there is literally nobody in the store... I didn't notice at first because I was just so enthralled by this place, but after I had been here a few hours I started to get a feeling like something was off. I mean there is NO ONE, here.

I was wondering if maybe there was some kind of city holiday or something? I don't know, do those exist? If anyone is in the area, again I'm at the Wadsmuns Department Store in Seattle. I think it was on the corner of d̸̬̒̃a̷͇̬͘͘t̴̻͉̀̔a̴̭̽ ̶̞̥̽̒c̴̺̗̿̂ǒ̶̲̂r̸̟̋͋r̶͍͚͋u̵͖͎̅̓p̴̢͍̿ṱ̸̡̀͗ě̸̟d̴̺͆́. I'm not getting any signal atm, and my phones date and time as location have been going wonky. Like right now it says it's 0:00 o'clock (?) and it's been like that for a few hours.

Another thing that is really making me worried (and I'm really not trying to let these things bother me, because I know there is a logical explanation) but not only is there no one in the store... I don't see anyone outside either. Like there are windows here but I looked outside for like an hour and didn't see a single person or car drive past. I've been thinking about just smashing one of the windows but they are huge and thick and probably cost a fortune. If I get caught being in here and I'm actually trespassing AND I break a window... I feel like it could be a lot more than a slap on the wrist and I can't go to jail folks.

There is internet but it barely seems to work. It's not like there isn't a whole lot to do here, but I just need to not be here and be at home. I've tried searching for the building but nothing comes up. I've looked everywhere for some kind of floor plan or fire exit but there's nothing. This place is huge though, so maybe I just am not looking hard enough...

edit:

Well... I spent the last few hours looking and I've resigned myself to my new life here... LOL. No but really I hope someone can help me out here? I've commandeered this mock bedroom in the furniture section and have been ransacking the cafe but I don't need comfort at this point I just want to get out of here. It's weird though, because, on my way to cafe I noticed some of the electronics were turning on and off by themselves.

edit 2:

I swear I just saw someone in here. I was looking across the store and I could see someone standing behind a rack of clothes. He was completely still. I think it was probably just a mannequin... but the thing is when I went over there it was gone.

edit 3:

The speaker system keeps going off... it just keeps repeating 'Service Announcement...' and 'Attention Shoppers' over and over again. It's been doing this for the last hour. I really want to get out of here. Why did nobody respond to my post or send for help? My phone now says the time is 88:88?

edit 4:

Guys please, there is someone here. I was on the escalator just now and it stopped halfway. I heard foot steps and turned around and saw him... I don't what 'he' was. I couldn't make out his face, but it looked like he was featureless... *like a mannequin*. He started walking up the escalator towards me so I booked it as fast I could and am hiding.

edit 5:

The lights in the store are now flickering and they are playing this horrible vaporware music. I haven't seen the 'mannequin man' again but I know he's here.

edit 6:

I've decided I need to get out of here. When I was running earlier I noticed an escalator I hadn't seen before. The lights are hardly working up here now, they flicker on for a few seconds but it's mostly dark. I did notice there was a light where the escalator was leading, well... it was pitch black otherwise but maybe the power is stable down there at least.

I'm thinking that's the service area and there should be an exit. If so, I should be out of here soon (*thank goodness*). I've been totally overreacting. The guy I saw was probably just a maintenance worker or something. I'll update, once I'm out of here... even though not one of you have responded but nonetheless, I'll let you guys know!

Ciao!

Hello, it's me, the girl. I was confused. Everything is fine. I was right, I was overreacting. I'm fine. I went to the basement, I did not meet the mannequin man down there. I'm going to stay here at Wadsmuns, I don't know why I said I wanted to leave. It was a lie, sorry. Sorry for wasting your time. In fact, you guys should come here too.

edit 8:

I'm not going to update anymore, I just wanted to say again, I'm fine. Nothing happened in the basement. I just decided to stay. This building is absolutely not a mirage designed to trap tourists with an insatiable desire for material objects.

Don't look for me, 

Good buy
