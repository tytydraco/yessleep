Vixen was my first dog. I got her for Christmas after years of begging my parents for a puppy, and when I moved into a tiny duplex in Georgia she came with me. 

But something is off with Vixen…

It all started when I let her stay the night with my upstairs neighbors. 

I was going to be gone for a weekend visiting my parents, and their landlord is very strict on no pets in the house. I was planning on paying for a pet-friendly hotel, but when my neighbors offered to let my dog stay with them I decided to go with it. It would save me some money, and I’ll admit that it would also be a nice break from having to take several walks throughout the day.

I left them with a care sheet on what she would need and also with plenty of dog food/toys and money to pay for anything they’d need. 

I thought everything had gone well

When I came back my dog seemed perfectly fine, if a little calmer than usual. I just chalked it up to being confused or anxious about me leaving.

But around 3 AM she did something she’d never done before…

I let my dog sleep in my bed. It makes me feel better knowing she is there, and it helps her stay asleep. Although, she never has had much trouble sleeping through the night. Not even as a puppy. 

But this night she was up. She was sitting at the end of the bed howling…if you could even call it howling. It sounded like she was wailing in pain. Each screech was loud and strangely enough, identical. There was no change in pitch or tone or volume. Every wail sounded the same. 

I tried petting her back and talking softly to her to calm her down, but it wouldn’t work. I tried picking her up but she wouldn’t move. She just kept howling.

Finally at 3:33 exactly she stopped, walked back to her spot on the bed, and lay down. 

I was freaked out, but tired. I stupidly just went back to bed. I shrugged off the whole situation as just a weird consequence of her daily schedule being taken away and then reimplemented. I thought surely it would all be better by tomorrow.

It has been 3 months now and it is getting worse…

Every night from 3:00 - 3:33 AM Vixen will wake up and scream into the night. But that isn’t the only thing;

She watches me

All day

Everyday

While I am sitting at my desk working she sits on her dog bed and stares at me, while I cook dinner she sits under the table and watches, even while I shower or change. I started locking the doors, but whenever I come out she is sitting there staring at the door.

And there is something off about her eyes.

They’re no longer the dopey sparkly puppy eyes that used to be filled with love. Her eyes look…human? I don’t know how to describe it…they seem too intelligent to be an animal’s eyes. Sometimes they even look calculating…

My neighbors moved out a few nights ago, and from that night my dog stopped sleeping. She now sits on the bed all night; watching me. 

I never thought I’d get to the point where I feel afraid of my dog, but here we are. It has been three nights now of me waking up in the middle of the night to her staring at me. 

Last night was the worse of them all…

She was not just staring, she was smiling. It sounds crazy, but I know what I saw. It was definitely a smile. Like she knows something nobody else does…

I don’t know what to do, and I am afraid… any advice would be appreciated.
