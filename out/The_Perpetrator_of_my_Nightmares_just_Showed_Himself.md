For the longest time, my sleep routine remained consistent: Fall asleep around 11, wake up around 2-3 due to nightmares, go back to sleep around 4, and wake up at 6 due to nightmares. The constant nightmares have plagued my mind to the point that I fear going to sleep at night. 

I should probably mention the fact that whenever I lay my head to rest, I hear whispers around my room. I’ve tried listening carefully, but it just sounds like gibberish to me. It startles me every night, but I just assumed there were spirits around me having a conversation and try my best to ignore it.

For context, my last nightmare was a two days ago, and it ended with a male cyclist brutally getting ran over by a vehicle. Yes, I saw blood, bones breaking, and the soul of the poor man being ripped away. It felt a little too real, and I ended up taking several naps during the day afterwards.

Last night, I was terrified to sleep (like every night). About five minutes after laying down, the whispers sounded again. Breathing softly, I listened for any audible words, but once again, just gibberish. I finally got comfortable enough and fell asleep pretty quickly. 

I stood in the middle of my old high school english classroom. Realizing I was dreaming, I sat down in the only empty chair next to a group of kids. They were coloring a paper board, not letting the chaos of the other kids distract them.

“Do you need help?” I asked the group as they turned to me. Their eyes were beady and soulless, as if they were robots. 

Suddenly, I was awake, back in my room. My body was paralyzed, and my head was shifted to face the wall in front of me, where a black and white portrait of a man stared back at me. The man was asian and had shoulder-length hair. His eyes were very small, giving off a very uncanny look to him. His square jaw was tilted, as he stared into my room. I couldn’t speak, so I thought to myself “Is this you?”

The room began convulsing and blurring as the man’s eyes met mine for a split second. I blinked, and his portrait was replaced by a family photo. The man was in the photo, along with a young woman, and an older man and woman. I thought to myself again, “Is this your family?”

The room pulsated even more than before, along with the tight squeeze and tingling sensation that my body felt. I knew something was wrong, and this was also a dream. I woke up, still tingling. The room settled and was quiet. Sitting up, I recalled what just happened, and instantly knew. 

The man had caused all my nightmares up to this point, and was finally showing himself after almost five years of living here. As the night creeps amongst me, I dread sleeping, fearing I’ll have another encounter with this man. If anything happens, I’ll give an update. Until then, I hope that me sharing my experience will give those reading this a good scare.
