I’ve been feeling nostalgic lately. The kind of deep, aching nostalgia that only seems to hit you in your early thirties, when you realize that your high school years are now officially “the good old days.” It’s a dangerous feeling, that nostalgia. It makes you do stupid things. Like digging through that dusty old box in the back of your closet, the one labeled “MEMORIES - DO NOT OPEN.”

That’s what I did last week. And inside, under a pile of faded concert ticket stubs and awkward, grainy photos, I found it. A single, scratched-up CD in a slim plastic case. There was no label, just two initials written in faded silver Sharpie on the CD itself, intertwined in a heart. My initials, and hers.

My first love. We were sixteen. It was a relationship of clumsy, heartfelt, teenage intensity that burned bright and then, inevitably, burned out. I hadn’t thought about her in years. But holding that CD… it was like opening a time capsule. It was a mixtape she had made for me. A relic from a time before streaming, before algorithms told you what you should like. A carefully curated collection of songs that were the entire soundtrack to our sixteenth summer.

I don’t even own a CD player anymore, not a real one. But I have an old, dusty one in my laptop. With a strange, almost reverent slowness, I slid the disc in. The drive whirred and clicked, struggling to read the scratched surface. And then, the first track started.

It was a slightly obscure indie rock song, the kind that was probably only cool to about a thousand people in the entire world, and we were two of them. It was our song. The sound quality was terrible. The digital transfer was full of pops, clicks, and a distinct, jarring skip right in the middle of the first chorus. But as the familiar, jangly guitar riff filled my quiet apartment, the feeling was electric. I was sixteen again. I was driving in her beat-up car, the windows down, the summer air thick and warm, and this song was blasting from the cheap speakers. The memory was so vivid, so potent, it was almost painful.

I listened to it a few times, lost in the bittersweet ache of a past that felt more real than my present. Then I went about my day.

The first time I heard it, I smiled. I was in the grocery store, in the sterile, fluorescent-lit purgatory of the cereal aisle, trying to decide between two identical boxes of bran flakes. And over the store’s tinny, terrible speaker system, I heard it. The jangly guitar riff. Our song. I hadn’t heard that song in the wild in at least a decade. I looked up at the ceiling, a genuine, surprised smile on my face. A happy coincidence. A little wink from the universe.

The next day, I was on the bus, heading to my soul-crushing office job. The bus was crowded, a press of damp coats and weary, morning faces. And through the dull roar of the engine and the murmur of conversation, I heard it again. Bleeding faintly from the headphones of the person standing next to me. The same jangly guitar. The same melancholic vocals. The sound was thin and distant, but it was unmistakable. Another coincidence, I thought, but a little thread of unease started to weave its way into my mind. The universe was starting to feel a little clingy.

That evening, I was in my apartment, trying to unwind. I heard a car drive by on the street below, its windows down, its stereo blasting. And the song that came pouring out was our song.

But this time, I noticed something that made the hairs on my arms stand up.

It was the skip.

Right in the middle of the chorus, the music jumped, a jarring, digital hiccup, before continuing. It was the exact same skip, at the exact same moment, as the one on my scratched, fifteen-year-old CD.

A cold, heavy feeling, like a block of ice, settled in my stomach. I rushed to my laptop, my heart pounding, and ejected the CD. I held it up to the light. The surface was a mess of scratches and scuffs, a roadmap of teenage carelessness. This wasn’t a coincidence. It couldn’t be.

The song wasn’t following me. My copy of the song was following me.

The next few days were a descent into a quiet, creeping, auditory hell. I heard it everywhere. It would come from a construction worker’s radio across the street, the sound tinny and distant, but I’d hear the familiar pop at the 42-second mark. I’d walk past a cafe, and the song would be playing from inside, the chorus skipping in that exact, sickening way. I was at the gym, and it started playing over the PA system, the scratches and clicks as clear as if it were being broadcast from my own laptop. I looked around, but no one else seemed to notice. They just kept lifting, kept running, oblivious to the fact that the soundtrack to their workout was a ghost from my past.

I was being haunted but by a sound. A specific, damaged, digital file that had somehow escaped its plastic prison and was now bleeding into the world around me.

I tried to fight it. I tried listening to other music, blasting it through my headphones to drown out the world. But it would always find a way in. I’d be listening to a podcast, and the host’s voice would distort, just for a second, into the melody of the song. The jingle for a commercial on TV would morph into the jangly guitar riff.

I tried to destroy the source.

I took the CD from my laptop. It felt strangely warm to the touch. I didn’t just throw it away. I knew that wouldn’t be enough. I took it out to the concrete patio behind my building, and I put it on the ground. I took a hammer, and I smashed it. I didn’t stop until it was nothing but a pile of glittering, rainbow-hued dust and sharp, plastic shards. I swept the dust into a bag, tied it tight, and buried it at the bottom of the dumpster. It was over. The connection had to be broken.

That night, I went to bed feeling a profound, exhausted relief. I slept, for the first time in what felt like weeks, a deep and dreamless sleep.

And then, I was woken up by the song.

It wasn't coming from outside. It wasn't coming from a car, or a radio, or a neighbor’s apartment.

It was coming from inside my own head.

It was a perfect, tinny, internal rendition of the song, playing on a relentless, maddening loop. And it was the scratched version. I could hear every pop, every click. I could feel the skip in the chorus like a missed heartbeat in my own chest.

I sat bolt upright in bed, my hands clamped over my ears, but it did nothing. It was in my brain.

I was desperate. I hadn’t spoken to her in fifteen years. We hadn’t ended on good terms. But she was the only one who might have an answer. She had made the mixtape. She had to know something.

It took me a full day of frantic, obsessive searching to find her. She wasn’t on social media. I finally found a work email address for her through a professional networking site. She was a graphic designer, living in a city a thousand miles away. I wrote the email, my hands shaking so badly I could barely type.

“I know this is insane,” I wrote. “We haven’t spoken in years. But I have to ask you about the mixtape you made me in high school. The one with that indie rock song on it. It’s important. Please, call me.”

I included my number. I didn’t expect a reply. But my phone rang less than an hour later.

Her voice was different, deeper, but I recognized it instantly. “What do you want?” she asked, her tone cold, wary.

“The mixtape,” I said, the words tumbling out in a panicked rush. “The song. I listened to it. And now it’s… it’s following me. I hear it everywhere. And it’s the scratched version. I smashed the CD, and now it’s in my head. It won’t stop.”

There was a long, heavy silence on the other end of the line. When she finally spoke, her voice was a choked, terrified whisper. “Oh, God. You played it.”

“What did you do?” I asked, a new, cold dread seeping into me. “What was that thing?”

“It was stupid,” she said, her voice cracking. “We were kids. We were… edgy. I found it online. On some old, weird, occult forum. It was a ritual. A spell. ‘A lover’s knot to tie two souls together forever with a song.’ You were supposed to record the song, a song that was special to both of you, and… and put a drop of your blood on the disc. And a drop of theirs.”

I flashed back to that summer. I remembered her pricking my finger with a safety pin, and then her own, laughing it off as a silly, romantic gesture, pressing our bleeding fingers to the shiny surface of a blank CD.

“I thought it was a joke,” she sobbed. “A stupid, goth, teenage game. I never thought it would actually… work.”

“Work how?” I demanded. “What did it do?”

“I don’t know!” she cried. “The post said it would create a… a connection. An echo. That the song would become a bridge between us. I thought it was romantic. ”

The song in my head, which had been a constant, low-grade hum, suddenly spiked in volume. And as it did, a flash of an image, a memory that was not my own, exploded behind my eyes.

I’m sitting at a drafting table. The light from a desk lamp is a warm, yellow pool on a half-finished logo design. My hand is holding a stylus, but the hand is smaller than my own, more slender, a silver ring on the index finger.

I gasped, stumbling back, my head throbbing. “I… I just saw something,” I stammered into the phone. “Your office. A logo design.”

I heard a sharp intake of breath on the other end. “How… how could you know that?”

“What’s your address?” I asked, a cold, terrifying thought dawning in my mind.

She was silent for a moment. “Why?”

“Just tell me.”

She told me. An address in a city I had never been to. A street I had never heard of. And as she said the name of the street, I could see it. I could see the row of brownstones, the ginkgo tree on the corner, the red door of her apartment building. I knew her address without ever being told. The knowledge was just… there. In my head.

That was a week ago. It’s getting worse. The song is a constant, maddening presence in my mind. The flashes are becoming more frequent, more vivid. I’ll be cooking dinner and suddenly have the memory of her arguing with her boss. I’ll be trying to sleep and experience the phantom sensation of her cat sleeping on my chest. Her life, her experiences, are bleeding into mine.

And it’s a two-way street. Yesterday, I was humming the song, unconsciously, a nervous, maddening habit I’ve developed. My phone rang a second later. It was her.

“Stop it,” she whispered, her voice frantic. “Stop. I heard you. It was right in my ear. Like you were standing right behind me. Stop it.”

I’m losing myself. We both are. The entity that we created, we tied to that scratched, broken piece of music. It’s squeezing our two separate lives, our two consciousnesses, into one. Collapsing fifteen years and a thousand miles into a single, shared, schizophrenic existence.

And I think I know how it has to end.

This thing, this entity, it’s a connection between two points. It needs both of us to exist. And if one of those points is erased… the bridge has to collapse.

I don’t want to die. But I can’t live like this, my mind a shared space with a ghost of a person I used to love, our thoughts and memories a tangled, screaming mess, all set to the soundtrack of a single, terrible, endlessly skipping song. And I know she can’t either.

So I’m writing this as… I don’t know. A confession? A warning? A suicide note? I just don't know which one of us is going to have to be the one to do it. But I think, if i did, i will be saving both of us.
