I don’t even know where to put this. So, I apologize for putting it on the sub. It’s very minimal, compared to things I’ve seen on here. But, it keeps happening.

I am a skeptic. I am a nonbeliever. I am an atheist. I was raised in the church, I remember, at the age of nine or ten, having dreams of the devil. I was on a roller coaster, and the devil was chasing me. I remember it vividly. But that isn’t what this is about. I’ve left that chapter of my life, where things I can’t explain happen. 

I moved towns about a year and two months ago. Everything was fine. Besides my children, everyone in my family is dead. I never asked them to send me a sign. I didn’t ask for a heart in the clouds, I didn’t ask for a red bird. No matter how much they believed in the afterlife and Jesus, I accepted that they were gone. So I have no belief in spirits or ghosts.

When I moved here, my phone kept falling. It’s on vibrate. That’s probably why it falls. It’s because I left it close to the edge of a surface, and the vibration from a notification made it fall. I’ve bought at least six packs of three screen protectors since I’ve lived in my new home. Three phone cases. Clumsy me. Funny though, it was always on a level surface. And I became more aware of leaving it near the edge. Yet it still fell. It fell today, off my nightstand, while I was in the shower. 

When I say I moved towns, I moved in with my fiancé and his daughter.  About six months ago, I came home from work, and they were sitting on the patio. I love him, as well as his daughter, but I know when I should leave them some space. So I did. I could see they’re deep in conversation, so I went to take a shower. Once I was out of the shower, and I saw she was inside, and he was sitting outside, I went out to ask him if she was okay. She was at work the whole time. She was never sitting out there. He had no idea what I was talking about. But I saw her, I saw the sun lining in her hair, I saw her head moving, I saw her hand moving with every inflection of conversation.

I was lying in bed, not long ago, and my mother called me from the bathroom. I was my mother‘s caretaker, before I watched her pass 5 years ago. She called me often from the bathroom, as she was dying from cancer. I was half asleep, I immediately hopped up to go help her. Of course, she wasn’t there. Of course she’s been gone for five years. But, she called me. She called me as clear as day. And I could sense her presence in the bathroom, waiting on me to help her. I smelled her White Shoulders perfume, I smelled her bowel movement, as graphic as that is, that was the reality of being a caretaker. But of course, she wasn’t in the bathroom. 

A month ago, my guy came home, and called me from the bedroom in the kitchen. He had brought home groceries. I heard the rustling of the bags, I heard the door open as he went to get another load. I was ready to make dinner, so I went into the kitchen to go help put things away. He was still at the store, I text him, because I walked into an empty kitchen. 

The last thing is, something coughed. It coughed in my shower. I was home on a vacation day, middle of the day, no television playing, just sitting on my kindle (Freida McFadden.) And something coughed. One loud, hearty, deep cough from my shower, as I was lying on the bed near the bathroom. The dogs heard it. I have two dogs, both barked toward my bathroom. I yelled for them to go outside, they both cowered. I only heard the one cough. 

I can explain more, this is sort of a hurried post. I just need to tell someone, anyone, that this is happening. I don’t believe in it, but I have no explanation. There has been more than one occasion that my fiancée has called me from one room, only to be in another, or outside. It’s weird; and I’m frustrated.
