I’m not sure where to start with this, but I need to get it out. Maybe typing it here will help me process what happened, or maybe someone out there has experienced something similar. I don’t know. I just know I’m scared, and I can’t shake the feeling that it’s not over.

This happened about a week ago, and I haven’t slept properly since. My girlfriend, Sarah, and I live in a small house just outside town. It’s old, creaky, but cozy enough for the two of us. We’ve been here about a year, and nothing weird ever happened until last Tuesday.

We had a friend, Mike, staying with us for a few days. He was passing through on a road trip and needed a place to crash. No big deal—we’ve got a spare room with a pull-out couch, so we told him to make himself at home. Mike’s a good guy, laid-back, not the type to make stuff up or get spooked easily. That’s why what he told us the first night freaked me out so much.

We were all hanging out in the living room, eating pizza and catching up. It was late, maybe 11 p.m., when Mike said he was beat and headed to the guest room. Sarah and I stayed up for another hour or so, watching some dumb show on Netflix before we went to bed. Around 2 a.m., I woke up to the sound of footsteps in the hallway. Heavy ones, not like Sarah’s usual tiptoeing when she gets up for water. I figured it was Mike, maybe going to the bathroom or grabbing a snack.

But the footsteps didn’t stop. They just kept pacing—back and forth, back and forth—right outside our bedroom door. I lay there, listening, waiting for them to stop or for a door to open, but it was just this steady, deliberate pacing. After a few minutes, I nudged Sarah awake and whispered, “Do you hear that?”

She frowned, still half-asleep, and listened. Her eyes widened a little. “Yeah. Is that Mike?”

“I don’t know,” I whispered back. “I’ll check.”

I got out of bed, heart pounding, and grabbed the baseball bat we keep under the bed. (Yeah, I know, cliché, but we live in a rural area, and it makes me feel better.) I opened the bedroom door, bat in hand, and peeked into the hallway. It was dark, but the moonlight coming through the window at the end of the hall gave me enough light to see. There was nothing there. No Mike, no shadow, nothing. The pacing had stopped the second I opened the door.

I checked the guest room, easing the door open as quietly as I could. Mike was passed out on the pull-out, snoring softly, his phone still in his hand like he’d fallen asleep scrolling. I closed the door and checked the rest of the house—kitchen, living room, bathroom. Everything was normal, doors locked, windows shut. I told myself it was just the house settling or maybe I’d imagined it. Old houses make noises, right?

The next morning, Mike was up before us, making coffee in the kitchen. He looked rough, like he hadn’t slept much. I asked him if he’d been up in the night, maybe walking around. He gave me a weird look and said, “Nah, man, I was out cold. Why?”

I told him about the footsteps. Sarah chimed in, saying she’d heard them too. Mike’s face went pale, and he set his mug down a little too hard. “Okay, that’s creepy,” he said. “Because I heard something last night too.”

He told us he’d woken up around 3 a.m. to what he thought was someone whispering. Not loud, just a low, constant murmur coming from the corner of the guest room. He couldn’t make out any words, but it sounded… urgent, he said. Like someone was trying to tell him something important but couldn’t quite get it out. He’d turned on the lamp, and the whispering stopped. He didn’t see anything in the room, but he said the air felt “wrong,” like it was too heavy, too still. He didn’t sleep much after that.

Sarah and I exchanged looks. We’re not superstitious people, but this was starting to feel off. I tried to laugh it off, saying maybe the house was just messing with us, but it didn’t land. We all felt uneasy.

That night, we decided to leave the hallway light on, just in case. Mike said he was fine sleeping in the guest room again, but he looked nervous. Sarah and I went to bed around midnight, and I don’t know when I fell asleep, but I woke up to the sound of Mike yelling.

I bolted out of bed, Sarah right behind me, and we ran to the guest room. Mike was sitting up on the couch, wide-eyed, clutching the blanket to his chest. “There’s something in here,” he said, his voice shaking. “I saw it.”

He pointed to the corner of the room—the same corner he’d heard the whispering from the night before. He said he’d woken up to that same heavy, murmuring sound, but this time, when he turned on the lamp, he saw something. A shape, he said, like a person but not quite. It was tall, too tall for the room, and it didn’t have a clear outline. Just this blurry, dark mass that seemed to soak up the light. He said it was standing in the corner, watching him, and when he screamed, it just… melted into the wall.

I didn’t know what to say. Sarah grabbed his arm and pulled him out of the room, and we all ended up in the living room, sitting on the couch with every light in the house on. Mike was shaking, and honestly, I wasn’t much better. Sarah kept asking if he was sure he hadn’t been dreaming, but he swore up and down he was awake. “I know what I saw,” he kept saying. “It wasn’t a dream.”

We didn’t go back to sleep that night. Mike grabbed his stuff and left at dawn, saying he’d rather sleep in his car than stay another night. I didn’t blame him. After he left, Sarah and I tried to talk it out, figure out what was going on. We checked the guest room, looked for anything that could’ve caused it—bad wiring, a draft, anything. Nothing. The room looked normal, just an old couch, a lamp, and a small dresser. But it felt… off. Like the air was too thick, just like Mike had described.

We haven’t used the guest room since. We keep the door closed, and I avoid walking past it at night. But last night, I heard the pacing again. Slow, heavy footsteps, back and forth in the hallway. I didn’t wake Sarah this time. I didn’t get up to check. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, listening until it stopped just before dawn.

I don’t know what’s in this house, but it’s not just old creaks or our imagination. Something’s here, and I think it’s been here longer than we have. We’re looking for a new place to rent, but it’s hard to find something we can afford. Until then, we’re stuck here, and I’m terrified of what might happen if we stay too long.

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? I don’t even know what I’m asking for—advice, I guess, or just to know I’m not crazy. I keep thinking about that shape Mike saw, and I wonder if it’s watching us even now. If it’s waiting.

I don’t know what to do.
