A normal life seems so obsolete when you’ve witnessed the things I have. 

To understand my story, we’d have to jump back in time a bit. While the exact nature of my abilities remains a mystery. My awakening to this new reality began a few months ago, It was on that date that I believe something inside me was either switched on or shaken loose. Whichever the case, I’m almost certain that the inciting incident took place on what I remember, in vivid detail as a Saturday.


I woke up earlier than usual that morning. By five AM, I was already fully dressed and alert... I was beyond alert. That’s because I knew, on a cellular level that the instinctual reaction that triggered me out of a normal sleep schedule was anything but. Even my cat was reacting oddly at the time. Not only was the small animal wide awake, he spent the duration of my post-awakened state in fight or flight mode, darting back and fourth across the thick carpet as if some, unseen force was pumping pure adrenaline into his condensed frame. 

Even as my own sense of unease had yet to outwardly manifest, I still felt beyond empathetic for my spooked pet, this being due to the fact that I started to feel my own inner turmoil bubbling to the surface. My throat began to tighten as the uneven concoction consolidated into a knot at the center of my throat. I had only been awake for the lesser half of an hour, and I was already stir-crazy... At the time, I figured that the only solution for such an ailment was fresh air, a brisk walk, easily serving as a spur of the moment cure....

Hindsight being what It is, there's a part of me that wishes I had just gone back to bed that morning, seeing as how, this so-called “fresh air” would only serve as the catalyst for a head-splitting cycle events that would go on to agitate the very foundation of what I perceived to be the physical world around me.

By six AM, I was jogging slowly down one of the main streets, only to stop dead in my tracks. I was so preoccupied with my immediate surroundings, that I had completely ignored the path ahead. The small town skyline that I had grown accustomed to over the years had become engulfed after the unprecedented arrival of a low hanging fog managed to ensnare any and all aspects of the visual landscape. The dense cloud acted as an impenetrable barrier that robbed the observer of what should have been mundane scenery... 

Even from my stagnant position, I had come to the unusual conclusion that what I witnessed was a rare phenomenon and not just by town standards. I was beginning to hear the alarm bells ringing in my gut. An alert that I can only describe as primal in nature. It was the kind of vague, uncategorized sense, only reserved when one finds themselves in the vicinity of something that had no place in our man-made kingdom of logic. A short moment had only elapsed when I felt the unmistakable tug of fear, pulling me in the direction I came. A direction that didn't lead to the fog. My self-preservation mode had, not only kicked in, It had already shot up to deafcon 5.

With every fiber of my being, yanking me in the opposite direction, I still compelled myself to move forward. A process that I knew to be disadvantageous. Somehow curiosity had managed to get the best of me in that moment. I needed to know who or what was responsible for such an intrusive incident.

Each step brought me deeper into the fog. Each step melted away any confidence that I had walked in with. I watched as cars and people continued on around me, all of them encapsulated in the repetitive nature of their daily routine. The further on I pushed, the more baffled I became. Something big was taking place and It genuinely puzzled me why no one was taking such an event seriously.

 My unease contracted into full-blown paranoia, this, accompanied with an added flurry of strange, mechanical sounds from above continued to twist my sanity into the disjointed shape of a madman’s.

As Seven thirty rolled in, I found myself unraveling into a full-blown nervous breakdown. The straw that almost broke the camels back came in the form of a single thought. I was being watched... Through the fog. I had no proof. The mist was too thick to see anything beyond the adjacent landmarks. I thought that I was losing my mind. Eventually, the fog cleared and everything settled back into normalcy.... 

With the exception of myself, as I never found a way to shake the continuous feeling that I was being observed

I’d never had the time to decompress, as the Orbs would come next. After a few chances encounter with skyward lights, I decided to document what began to go above and beyond the typical Ufo sighting. While the casual observer might have shrugged the appearance of the orbs off as a random fluke, I knew, without a hint of a doubt that the paranormal happenings were intimately linked with the fog that rolled into town only a few days earlier

After a few, chance encounters with a bevy of strange lights in the sky, I had become obsessed with UFOS... Or rather catching them on camera. 

A handful of blurry photos would serve as the catalyst for what would become a series of nightly excursions. As I got better as a photographer, so too did my pictures see a sudden shift from “OK” to “GOOD”.

The hyperactive spheres would bounce in and out of sight, in an improvised rotation of gravity-defying antics that appeared to be leaps and bounds ahead of any drone based technology that I knew of.

I had been taking photos for a couple of weeks before reality, as I knew it had been shattered during the span of a single night.

It wasn't long after that when I noticed them... Just sitting there in some abandoned parking lot. A fleet. A literal fleet worth of ships... All of them clustered together in a uniformed arrangement. An otherworldly outpost, cloaked in an ever-swirling barrier of translucent fog. The fog would never dissipate, nor blow away.  It simply sat there, even as I began to slowly feel the breeze pick up around

I stood frozen at the edge of the lot, the camera hanging around my neck feeling heavier than ever, like a burden I wasn’t sure I was ready to carry. My instinct screamed at me to lift it, to capture what I was seeing, but something held me back an overwhelming sense that pointing a lens at this impossible gathering might somehow cross a line I didn’t fully understand. The sight before me was both awe-inspiring and profoundly unsettling, like staring into the abyss and realizing it was staring back.

The fleet of ships sat perfectly still, their sleek, metallic forms glowing faintly against the swirling fog that surrounded them. The fog wasn’t natural it didn’t roll or drift like clouds or mist would. It hung in the air, alive, pulsating in time with a strange vibration that resonated in my chest and teeth. The hum was low but unrelenting, like a giant invisible tuning fork set to an impossible frequency. I could feel it under my skin, pulling at something primal within me.

And then, I saw movement.  

Out of the fog, they emerged. Figures, tall and elongated, their silhouettes unnervingly fluid as they glided toward me. Their forms shimmered with an almost liquid quality, as though they weren’t entirely bound by the rules of this world. My breath caught in my throat, and my body screamed at me to run, but I couldn’t. My feet felt rooted to the ground, not from fear alone but something deeper a sense that this moment had been building long before I ever set foot in that parking lot.

They stopped a few feet away. I could barely make out their features in the dim, otherworldly light, but their presence was overwhelming. They exuded an energy that pressed against my mind like a physical force. My thoughts felt invaded, as though someone or something was gently sorting through them.  

Then, it happened.  

One of the beings stepped forward, raising what looked like a hand, long and crystalline, refracting light in a way that made it hard to focus on. It didn’t speak, not out loud, but its voice bloomed in my mind like a burst of color.  

“You’ve been chosen.”

The words rang out, clear and calm, yet layered with meanings I couldn’t fully grasp. Chosen for what? My mind raced with possibilities, none of them comforting. Was I supposed to go with them? To leave everything behind? To do something unimaginable?  

I couldn’t form the questions. Before I could even think to ask, the being reached toward me. Its crystalline hand hovered inches from mine, waiting. Against every survival instinct screaming at me to turn and run, I reached out. The moment our hands met, the world dissolved.  

Everything around me vanished, replaced by a cascade of light and color. My body was gone, or maybe it wasn’t. I couldn’t tell. I was everywhere and nowhere at once, floating in a sea of infinite possibilities.  

Images flooded my mind,planets bathed in golden light, stars collapsing into brilliant supernovas, galaxies spinning in intricate patterns that defied comprehension. I saw civilizations far more advanced than ours, their cities glittering like constellations. I saw beings of all shapes and forms, living lives so far removed from anything I could understand.  

Then the images shifted. I saw Earth. Small. Fragile. It hung in the vastness of space like a glass ornament, beautiful and breakable. I saw its history flash before me, its beginnings, its growth, its struggles. And I saw its future, splintering into countless possibilities, some hopeful, others horrifying.  

The voice returned, echoing through the kaleidoscope of light and sound. **“Your kind is not prepared. You must prepare them.”**  

Before I could respond, the vision ended. I was back in the parking lot, the ships still there, the beings still watching me. But everything felt different now. My mind buzzed with fragments of knowledge too vast to comprehend. I felt like a vessel, filled to the brim with something I couldn’t even begin to understand.  

Without a word, the beings turned and vanished into the fog. The ships began to shimmer, their forms flickering in and out of visibility before finally disappearing entirely. The fog dissipated slowly, leaving the lot as empty and unremarkable as it had been before.  

I stood there for what felt like hours, trying to process what had just happened. My camera was still around my neck, but when I checked the memory card, the photos were gone. In their place were symbols strange, intricate patterns that seemed to pulse with a life of their own. I had no idea what they meant, but I knew they weren’t random.  

When I finally made it home, everything felt off. My cat, normally aloof, sat by the window, staring at me with an intensity I’d never seen before. Outside, the town looked the same, but I felt... disconnected, like I was seeing it from a distance.  

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, replaying the events over and over in my mind. The message they’d given me echoed in my thoughts

Your kind must prepare.”

But prepare for what?  

I didn’t have answers. All I had was a gnawing sense of urgency and the unshakable feeling that I was being watched. Days turned into weeks, and the feeling didn’t fade. It intensified. Every shadow, every flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye felt like another piece of a puzzle I couldn’t yet see.  

The orbs returned, but I didn’t bother trying to photograph them anymore. I knew it wasn’t about proof. It was about what came next.  

And whatever it was, I knew one thing for certain My life, my world, would never be the same again.
