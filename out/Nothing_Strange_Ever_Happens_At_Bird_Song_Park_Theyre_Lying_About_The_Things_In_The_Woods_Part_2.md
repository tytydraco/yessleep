( Part 1 https://redd.it/1dzeizv )

There were some deep drag marks in the mud outside. I followed the path my stomach sinking when I spotted blood slowly getting washed away by the rain. I had two choices. Keep going down the path to a working phone, or try and find a person I barely knew.  

I picked the wrong option swearing I would only go so far and then head back. By some miracle, I didn’t find Nikhil but it was too late.  

My flashlight beam cut through the trees landing on him a few feet away. I opened my mouth to call out to him but my voice stopped from the fear of seeing pale shapes stalking through the woods.   

He must have heard my footsteps. His head turned enough for me to see his bloody face.  

“Lee?” he asked just before those creatures fell on him.   

I screamed unable to reach him in time. Within seconds at least ten of those monsters swarmed him, pulling my new friend to the ground. Terrible sounds of bones breaking and flesh ripping came. A few creatures couldn’t squeeze into the feeding frenzy so they turned their attention in my direction.  

I hated myself at that moment but I turned to run. Pale long legs hot on my trail. I heard something almost like a high-pitched bird as creatures screamed behind me. I stopped long enough to bring the axe down on a creature’s exposed next. It fell to the ground as two more turned on it.  

I kept racing through the woods stopping long enough to wound or kill one of my stalkers. If they weren’t interested in eating their dead or wounded, I wouldn’t have lived for as long as I did.  

I didn’t know how long I fought for. I couldn’t hold out forever. Just as I thought the numbers started to thin out, five more monsters came from the trees. My body ached, my lungs burned and I felt as if I was going to pass out. I wasn’t going to be able to fight off all of these creatures. I found a clear pathway through them and booked it through the trees. Suddenly a large branch came swinging into my face knocking me off my feet.  

I should have died then. And yet I woke up again being dragged by two of those creatures. I struggled but they clamped down harder on my arms.   

The rain had stopped. Blood and mud covered my clothing. My body shook from the cold and fear. I didn’t understand why they hadn’t just eaten me yet.  

They dragged me into a large clearing with a roaring fire in the middle. More of those monsters lingered around, eyes reflecting in the low light. The makeshift camp was covered with stolen trash made into nests.  

We stopped and I was able to stand up but not get my arms free from those creatures. The tallest of the monsters walked into the light of the campfire. Unlike the other creatures, he looked as if he had human intelligence. An amused expression came over his face as he adjusted a pile of rags made into a headdress.  He walked over to us leaning down so we were eye to eye.  

“Strong flesh.” it spoke in a low raspy voice.  

The other creatures joined in repeating the words like a chant. The sounds died down when the leader spoke again.  

“Join us. We want. We want strong flesh. We bring you food. Eat the cabin man. Join us.”  

Bile rose in my throat. I shook my head. Long thin fingers reached up to grab my chin so painfully I thought my jaw would break.   

“We want. Us or eaten.”  

He shook my head hard back and forth as if he found the action funny. I finally pulled away, face throbbing. My eyes darted around trying to figure out what to do. The creatures holding my arms had a gripe too strong to get free from. I refused to become a creature like them. There needed to be another option death or something far worse.  

If I was going to die, I might as well take one more of these monsters down with me.   

My face shot out and I latched my teeth deep into the flesh of the taller monster’s throat. It let out a garbled scream but I refused to let go. The creatures holding me back lessened their grip from shock. I pulled my arms free. The fight between us was a mess of desperation. Thick vile blood flooded my mouth nearly making it impossible to keep biting. The threat of death motivated me to keep going.  

By the end I found myself standing over the fading body of the leader, body exhausted and wounded from the night's events. All of those creatures froze eyes fixed on me. I breathed hard waiting for them to move. I might be able to kill one more monster. But I couldn’t kill them all.  

“Well?” I asked them after spitting out the disgusting blood from my mouth.  

They started to crawl closer, scared yet staving. One stood, hunger in its eyes. It started to run forward; my body was tense ready for attack.  

A sound came like a quick birdsong. The creature that had run towards me suddenly collapsed to the ground. Half the body suddenly disappeared into thin air. I was shocked and didn’t understand what happened.  

“Sorry, I needed to get changed.”  

I slowly turned my head still not understanding what I was seeing. The person I was positive had been torn apart stood in fresh clean clothing.  He waved and smiled like we were meeting for a pleasant day out.  

“Nikhil...” I said unable to act in any other way.  

The creatures got over their fear and started to move. They turned to flee also unsure of how one of them was killed. Nikhil’s body went limp for a second as if he was a puppet with its strings cut. He tilted to the side about to fall to the ground, nothing behind his eyes for those few moments. I heard a sharp whistling sound, and then Nikhil snapped back. When I turned my head to look back at the camp of creatures my stomach twisted at the sight.  

The fire had been stomped out. A large indent of some sort of strange foot had destroyed the camps. Embers gave off enough light so I could see the bodies of the creatures. Each appeared as if they had been cut in half. No, bitten in half.  

“Daniel came to collect your friends. I’m sorry. The one didn’t make it and the other was dead before the ranger found him.” Nikhil explained as he walked towards me confidently on his feet.  

I couldn’t move. The information refused to seep into my brain. I felt a hand take my own making a chill shoot directly to my bones.  

“You’re shaking.” Nikhil pointed out.  

I met his eyes. It felt like he could see me. At that moment I knew he could. His sight was different than a human. Or anything else for that matter.   

“What...” I choked out.   

“Do you want to go back to the office or to the cabin to rest?”  

I knew he would listen to anything I asked for. If I went back to the office to see how Chris and Conner were doing, I wouldn’t get the answers I needed.   

“I’ll go with you.” I said mouth dry.  

He nodded and kept my hand in his so he could guide me back through the woods. My legs shook. Fear still shot through my heart at any sound from the woods. Deep down I wondered if I just agreed to something I could not come back from.  

We didn’t speak the entire way back. Blood stained the wooden cabin floor. Nikhil brought out more backpacks to find another set of clean clothing so I could change into. I spent a long time in the small washroom unable to wash away the blood from my hands. No matter how hard I scrubbed I still saw it.  

When I came out, the cabin had been cleaned up. A lantern on a table was the only source of light. A pile of blankets had been placed on the floor next to the bed.   

“You still have a few hours until sunrise. You should get some rest.” Nikhil said.  

He was sitting on the pile of blankets by the bed. I paused unsure if I could actually sleep that night.  

“Do you want me to stay outside?” He offered.  

I shook my head a little surprised by my answer. I didn’t want to force a blind man out of his own place, even though I knew he wasn’t human. There was a small conversation about me sleeping on the floor but he refused. I didn’t press too hard a bit scared of what he might do if I disagreed.  

I crawled into bed, feeling like the dead and yet not tired at all. I stared out the window at the clear sky through the trees. We didn’t speak for a while then Nikhil’s voice cut through the darkness.  

“Are the stars out tonight?” He asked.  

“Yes. There is a lot of them.” I answered back.  

Again, we didn’t speak as I got ready for the big questions.   

“The rangers know about you.” I stated.  

“Yes.”  

He sat up to lean his head against the bed so I could hear him better.  

“A long time ago I made a deal so I'm bound to if they give me an offering so I keep this place peaceful. But...” His head moved as if he was looking at me. “I’ll tell you a secret. I lied. There is nothing truly binding me to this place.”  

I saw his smile in the darkness. He had been waiting a long time to tell someone that fact. I forced down a thousand questions to focus on one at a time.  

“Why here?” I asked.  

“It's quiet. My hearing is very good. If I'm too close to a city I can always hear humans going about their lives and you are very loud creatures. I know at some point that no matter where I go, I’ll have to listen to your kind. When that time comes, I don’t know how long I’ll last before I snap and make everything quiet again.”  

I swallowed hard letting that information sink in. The person next to me was old and powerful. I don’t think humans could ever fully understand what was hiding behind his mask.  I lay on my back, sweat starting to form on my forehead.  

“Why... did you save me?” I spoke carefully not certain I wanted the answer.  

He could have let us all die that night. But also, I knew he heard the storm coming while we walked to the cabin that day. He wanted me to stay for some unknown reason. I felt his weight on the bed and my muscles locked in fear. I didn’t dare move as he carefully pressed an ear to my chest.  

“I like this sound.” He whispered listening to my heartbeat.  

It wasn’t just the sound of a racing heart. He loved the sound of fear. My jaw tightened at the realization. Slowly he moved away to curl up on the floor. We were done talking for the night. I fell asleep for maybe an hour around sunrise.   

I woke up to Nikhil making egg sandwiches for us to eat on our walk down the trail. The storm had left the air cool and clean. I kept my breakfast down oddly feeling fine enough to walk beside a monster I had been frightened of the night before.  

We met Daniel on the trail just before we arrived at the office. Nikhil left asking that I drop by again.  

“I thought you weren’t coming back.” Daniel admitted after Nikhil left.  

“I got lucky and he was just lonely.” I said with a shake of my head.  

I wanted to ask him so many things. Like why Nikhil had camper's backpacks and if there were just cow tongues in the basket from yesterday. I stayed silent fearing the answers.  

Conner had gone to the hospital but Chris stayed behind. He wrapped me in a death grip of a hug when I walked inside the office. I didn’t enjoy it and felt awkward but I didn’t pull away. I think he needed a hug from someone.  

“Now what?” I asked after Chris peeled away.  

“Nothing. The two of your friends got lost in the storm and died of the elements before we could find them. It happens all the time.” The older ranger said with a shrug.  

“I knew there was a cover-up! I won’t stand by it! They were my friends and it’s my fault they’re gone! I’ll use every last cent to expose what happened!” Chris said with tears in his eyes lessening the impact of his speech.  

He could only say these things because he only saw the pale monsters in the woods and not the thing that ate them. A birdsong rang out from outside. Then the office shook as if something large and heavy dropped outside.  

We all looked out the now-darkened window in horror. Beyond it was a creature so massive we only saw one sharp tooth when it opened its mouth to smile. The whistling came again and the shape disappeared faster than we could blink. Sounds crashed outside and to his credit, Chris raced out the door to see what just happened.  

A large tree had been beside the building. Now it was just the trunk with a massive chunk taken out of branches around it. It looked like something had come down and taken a bite out of the tree line. Some more branches fell to the ground creating a mess.   

Chris understood there were forces in this world that money couldn’t go against.  

“I liked that tree...” The older ranger sighed.   

He hadn’t even put down his cup of coffee.  

We wisely decided to leave shortly afterward. I didn’t think Chris was in the state to drive so I offered to take him into town. I've never seen a person's son defeated before.   

“It’s not your fault. You need to understand that. There was no way to know what was inside those woods. It was like you came across a tornado or any other force of nature. We should be thankful three of us made it out alive.”  

Chris nodded and got out of the car. He called for someone else to pick him up. I was beyond ready to go home after all of this.   

“Hey.” I rolled down my car window to call out to him before I left. “Nothing odd happens in Birdsong Park, right?”  

He didn’t nod for a full minute. If he disagreed with the statement, he risked his life.   

I wanted to leave it all at that. For the last I saw of this place was in my mirror as I drove away. But I was drawn back there a few weeks later.  

That’s a story for a different time. As I drove home I just kept repeating to myself there was nothing strange about that place as if my life depended on it.
