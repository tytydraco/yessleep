My town’s suburban legend of The Culvert goes like this: in the 80s, some lady went missing after her husband caught her with, not another man, but a creature. Some say he killed her, chopped her up into little pieces, and flushed her down the toilet in small batches until she was completely gone. Other, more ghoulish people, claim she ran away with her creature/lover to the sewage systems on the outskirts of town where they lived out the rest of their days in foul-smelling bliss.

Some swear they spotted the offspring, christened The Culvert, near the pipes it calls home. It’s said to have a strangely beautiful face framed by a wide set of horns or antlers, with pale, mottled skin, and a contorted figure draped in ragged, hand-stitched cloth. No video sightings of this creature exist. Even the local teens are too spooked to attempt a hoax. The legend warns that those who impersonate The Culvert are fated to become it, and yet, that’s exactly what I set out to do.

You probably think I’m an idiot for doing the one thing the legend warned against, and you’re absolutely right. I’m well aware that this decision was absolutely the worst mistake I have ever made, so please don’t lecture me in the comments. I just wanted to go viral.

I foolishly crafted a smooth, expressionless paper-mache mask with lofty deer antlers attached, sloppily sewed some rudimentary clothes, and painted my skin a patchy mix of red, purple, and ashen white. I set out for the sewers early in the morning donning my costume and an old camcorder.

The sewer’s leaky mouth gaped wide, foreboding. My dinky flashlight illuminated graffiti-tattooed walls. A rat scampered between my feet, disappearing into the daylight behind me.

As I delved deeper and deeper into the twisting pipes, beer cans and condom wrappers gave way to more unsettling litter, a waterlogged teddy bear begging for euthanasia, a wayward mannequin torso stripped bare. I filmed every eerie detail with morbid delight.

I could not ignore the ghostly call of music emanating from the depths of the piping before me. It grew louder the further I ventured. My shoulders grew tense, my jaw set.

The unfamiliar melody grew deafening as the tunnel sloped wide into a large iron chamber. Dead end.

When I sloshed in, the hair on the back of my neck instantly rose. It was adorned with dated but well maintained furniture. A floral couch sealed in plastic, an ornate brass bed frame, and a solid wood kitchen table with two vinyl chairs. Seated there, facing me, was a woman. She was in her 60s or 70s, and markedly lovely. She wore a pristine bubblegum pink tracksuit with lipstick to match.

She sat perfectly still, bolt upright, with her eyes peacefully closed. Surely something was wrong, but I could not place exactly what. I approached her tentatively, but with each step, my stomach dropped further. I laid a hand on her shoulder and her head lolled to the side at an unnatural angle. Of course, she was dead.

There was no smell, no sign of decay. How long had she been there? I was about to turn, about to collect my camera and sprint for the outside world when I felt the presence of someone directly behind me.

I spun and locked eyes with what could only be The Culvert. He stood there, blocking the only exit, attempting a disarming smile.

He was tall and gaunt, stooping slightly to avoid hitting his head. His skin was sickly and translucent with blue, purple, green ropey veins spidering right below the surface. He did not have antlers, as my classmates had once detailed, but his skull did jut out on either side, perhaps a deformity. His ribcage bulged, shoulders protruded. His face was fine, almost handsome, with milky blue eyes that looked pained, pleading.

I am only human. I screamed. Loud.

This sent him barreling towards me, fibrous limbs flailing about revoltingly. I stumbled backward, tripping over the corpse’s stark white Keds and slamming my head on the slimy floor. My eyes went blind for one, two, three seconds too long, and by the time I got my bearings, he was upon me, groping, pawing, whimpering like a spooked animal.

Pins and needles prickled across my skin. When I jolted up against him, he did not budge, and engulfed my writhing wrists and ankles in his enormous hands.

But those frosted eyes bore into mine, beseeching me. For a moment, I almost felt bad for him. *What does he want?*

“Shhhh,” he begged, brow pinched with concern and… fear.

He scooped me up and slid me beneath the bed as if I weighed nothing. He raised his palms toward me as if to say, *stay put*.

I obeyed and held my breath as he rummaged around the room, turned off that hellish music, and preened the woman’s corpse lovingly. They did bear a passing resemblance. Same black hair, delicate bone structure. My mind sprinted.

*What does he want? Why did he look scared? There must be something else down here. Something far worse. Maybe I should run.*

Before I could work up the nerve, he shuttered and let out a wheezing gasp. He dropped to his knees and cast one final pitying look at me. His bones snapped and twisted into something new, unrecognizable. The skull split under his scalp with a wet pop, forming mock antlers, stretching his thin scalp to a sickening degree. He screamed in agony as his eyes rolled back into their sockets, replaced by a glazed new set, shining and pitch black. I thought of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

It stretched its limbs awkwardly and surveyed its surroundings. *I was wrong*, I despaired, *that* *is The Culvert*. It sniffed the sour air indulgently, then spun around, jerking to a stop at the sight of me.

What choice did I have? I bolted.

The Culvert roared, an enraged, guttural vibration I felt in my bones. I risked a glance backward and saw it squirming up the sewer pipe and sprinting along the ceiling on all fours. It was fast, but I was faster.

At a fork in the piping, I hung a right, then a left, then a right again, just as I had when I ventured through not too long before. *Just around this curve*, I thought, expecting to be welcomed with sunshine. As I skidded around the corner, my stomach hitched. More inky darkness.

*How could I be lost*? The layout was so simple. I paused, but The Culvert’s soggy footfalls endured punishingly only moments behind. I pushed forward, lungs stinging with exertion, legs begging me to slow down.

The tunnels stretched ceaselessly. I ran for what felt like hours, twisting through fork after fork, plunging deeper into the bowels of that infernal maze. I could not shut off the thoughts ricocheting inside my skull: *You’re dead. You’re dead. Good as dead!* I could swear the pipes were constricting, closing in on me.

I peered over my shoulder only for a minute and clipped a rod on the floor, sending myself soaring forward and straight into the stagnant water below me. I crashed. Hard. Smacking my chin firmly on rusty metal.

I must have blacked out, but only for a second. With a start, I pulled my face out of the oily water and gasped for air. It was in my nose, my eyes, my mouth. I blinked the mud out of my vision and was rewarded with daylight not 20 feet ahead of me. I scrambled on all fours towards the blinding afternoon, but was grasped by the thing at the last second.

It wrestled me below the shallow surface again and again, but I thrashed with everything I had left. Its jaws split wider. Its wet insides squirmed forward, pouring down from the skull and dangling mere inches from my face in pulsing, purple tendrils. *It wants to be inside of me*. I clamped my mouth shut and gave one more violent kick, setting it slightly off balance.

I clambered to my feet and lunged for the light with everything I had left. Then, I was out in the secluded woods. I forced my dazzled eyes open, searching desperately for the creature, but as I hoped, it did not follow me out of the sewer’s yawning maw.

I went straight to the police station, as any sane person would, but I tamed my story a bit for credibility. I’ve seen movies.

The drive home felt eternal. All I wanted to do was crawl into bed and sleep for a few days. I didn’t even care about the video, didn’t mind that I had forgotten my camcorder or lost that mask in the melee. I wanted no reminders of this awful day.

I peeled off my wet clothes, balled them up by the back door, and scrubbed my skin raw in the shower.

I yearned for sleep, but my brain kept buzzing. I padded into the sunroom, hoping to catch the amber sunset.

That’s when I saw it. My mask, soggy, twisted, its jaws ripped wide: a warning.

The air hung thick and putrid. I spotted a trail of muddy footprints leading to the wobbly glass door. A floorboard creaked behind me. I whirled around, and there, through the doorway, I glimpsed the edge of a tufted antler, one beady black eye. My heart leapt into my throat. *Run for your life*, my brain screamed. And I did.

I’ve been camping out in my car for the past few hours, I’m not sure where else to go but the shopping mall. I watch people meander in and out of the ShopRite, trying to clear my thoughts, but I can’t escape the visions of that *thing*. I envy these people, and their ignorance of the evil holed up right below their feet.

I’ll just keep waiting until the police give me a call, but I already know what they’re going to say: the sewers are empty.

The street lamps just kicked on, and the parking lot is growing scant. Soon, I’ll be alone out here. I’ll just have to keep scanning the horizon, searching for The Culvert.
