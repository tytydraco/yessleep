[People](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midnightcreepypasta0/) hear demon hunter and think I’m some kind of crusader. Holy water, silver bullets, all that crap. That’s not me. I’m not out here to kill anything. I’m out here to find her. Because… well, she has something that belongs to me. My dad. At least I think she does. I’m getting the bulk of my information from my mum, and my mum, she isn’t what people would call a reliable source. She lives in Beacon Point Sanatorium on the edge of Corvus Vale. She says a demon took my dad. But Everyone else says she killed him. That’s why she’s there, that’s why I was taken from her care when I was just a week old, and that’s why I’ve never met my big brother. I could be out there looking for him, trying to find the family I never had. But instead, I’m hunting a demon, because, unlike everyone else, I believe my mum. She told the police a demon took him after a ritual went wrong. Looking at it from an outsider’s perspective, I can understand why they think she’s crazy. she told the police this information while standing next to his cold, dead body. I guess you can’t accuse something of taking someone when they are clearly visible on your living-room floor, I get that. But she insisted that this demon took his soul and left his body. That was the moment they stopped calling her an outright killer and started calling the shrink. I’m documenting this here because I need someone to know what I’m doing, even if its just strangers on the internet. I grew up being past from pillar to post in a shitty foster care system, I have no one of real value in my life. If this all goes to shit, I need someone to know…I tried. So, anyway, ill start at the beginning, I guess.  
My name is Alex, Alex Hammond, I was born in Vale central infirmary in 1989. My parents are-…were. Shannon and Jerry Hammond. I don’t know anything about my brother. He was 2 when we were separated.  
I found my Mum recently, after years of not looking.  That sounds bad, I know. But if you’re told the same story enough times, it starts to stick. You stop asking questions. For 36 years my mum was a compulsive lying psychotic murderer and that’s all there was to it. School was a cruel place. My life was common knowledge. When I started my new job as a tree surgeon up by hollowthorn forest, it didn’t take long to realise people still knew more about me than I did. “You ever spoke to her then?” Gary, my team leader asked out of the blue one day whilst casually munching on a tuna sandwich. “Spoke to who?” “Your mum mate.” “No, I don’t have a reason to, wouldn’t know where to find her even if I did.” I said, internally rolling my eyes. This line of questioning was something I was accustomed to, but I was hoping I could at least escape it at work. Gary wiped the crumbs that had accumulated in his stubble way with his sleeve, looking at me wide eyed. “Mate... she’s in there” he pointed a meaty finger upward, towards an ancient manor house style building sitting alone nestled amongst the very trees we were working on.



Beacon point isn’t far from my house. Corvus vale isn’t a big town. It’s About a 30-minute walk as the crow flies or a 10-minute drive. It sits just inside hollowstone forest, surrounded by a large stone wall. It’s peaks and chimneys visible from the road. It’s a secure site, The west wing, housed the criminals deemed too mentally unstable for general population, the rest of the building was used as a long-term residential facility for people with severe mental illnesses. White stone signs with polite fonts and little bird logos dotted the long driveway directing visitors. I was going to the west wing. Inside everything smelled like bleach and stale coffee. I didn’t tell anyone I was going. Who would I tell. I signed the visitor sheet with a pen that didn’t work until it did. The receptionist barely glanced in my direction. “Who are you here to see?” “Shannon Hammond.” She Paused and looked up. “I’m sorry Hammond is on family only visitation, and she doesn’t have any family” “I’m her son.” That got me a look. Not a kind one. More like really? I fished out my wallet and slid my ID across the desk. She didn’t pick it up. Her eyes ping ponged from the card to my face and back too many times before she sighed and printed me a badge. After an agonising wait, she buzzed me through. “Follow the lines” she said matter-of-factly. “Yellow to the visiting suit, red to the reading room, green to the lunch hall, ignore the black” “Ignore the black?” I echoed “yeah...” My trainers squeaked on the over polished floor as I followed a yellow line painted beneath them. I counted doors to stop my hands from shaking; I was so nervous. I felt as though I had shifted back in time, to the fourteen-year-old me, clutching a bin liner full of clothes outside yet another stranger’s door with a social worker telling me to be brave.

Mum sat facing away from me, at a table with edges rounded down to nothing. she staired vacantly out of the window as I sat opposite her. Her hands folded like she was waiting for church. She looked older than the picture I had. Of course she did. She had to be in at least her early sixties now. Her hair was completely grey; she’d tried to brush it neat. Her eyes met mine slowly. “Hello,” she said, softly. “Hi.” Silence fell into the space between us and had to be pushed aside. “I brought you something.” I didn’t know why I said that. I hadn’t. But I wanted to. Fruit. A magazine. A miracle. She smiled anyway. “You brought me you.” “I’m Alex,” I said, which was stupid. She knew that. But I needed to say it out loud. I needed it to be true in the air, not just in a file. “I know,” she said. Her eyes were wet, but she didn’t cry. She had the tired control of someone who has learned what crying costs in places like this. For a minute we talked about nothing. The Weather. My job. My favourite food. Then it all wanted to pour out. The questions. But I didn’t know how to open that door without everything falling through the floor. She did it for me. “You look like your father” she said, quietly. A tinge of fear shot up my spine. For a moment I had visions of her lunging at me from across the table. I stayed quiet and forced a thin smile. “Do you see him?” she asked. “Who?” “your father.” I stared at her, confused. I started to think id made a huge mistake in coming here. She was clearly deranged. She saw the puzzled look on my face and started to elaborate. She smiled, “Do you see a bird? Strange looking fellow. You wouldn’t miss it if you saw.”

  
My mouth went dry. “Sometimes,” I said. “There’s a weird one that sits on my window. It’s probably got a nest” “What makes him weird?”. “He a crow but he’s white” I said flatly. She nodded like we were finally talking about something that mattered. “That’s your dad,” she said. Certain. I laughed. A small, ugly sound. “spiritually speaking” I said not knowing if it was a question or a statement. “No, literally speaking” I raised an eyebrow. This was as good of an opening as I was going to get. “How?” I hated how much I needed that word. She turned her hands palm up on the table, like showing me she had nothing hidden. “I’ve waited thirty-six years for a chance to tell you the truth Alex. Let me start from the beginning” She sat back in her chair, the hard, cheap plastic clicking under the strain.

  
“We wanted a child,” she said. “But the doctors said no. There was an incident when your father was young, he needed emergency surgery to repair an abdominal hernia but there was an accident, both vas deferens were severely damaged during the surgery leaving them scared beyond repair. No one knew. Not until it was too late.” “I don’t know what those words mean” I replied honestly. “His balls didn’t work” “oh...” I looked away embarrassed. She half smirked before continuing. “Your father wanted a child of his own so badly, he searched high and low for an answer” “I thought I had a brother.” I interrupted “Didn’t he already have a child of his own?” “This was before your brother” she stated before continuing. “He found a book, in a dusty old shop in town. Started studying the occult” “What?” “Yes, that was exactly my reaction when he told me too.” She agreed. “But it worked” “What worked?” I asked cautiously. “The summoning spell” she whispered. I’d heard enough I couldn’t believe I just sat though that. She was clearly deranged. I started to stand; she reached for my wrist stopping me dead. An icy chill running up my spine. “Please Alex, just hear me.” Her eyes were pleading. “If at the end you never want to return, I will understand but please, let me finish.” I sat down slowly. If only to get her to release me. She stroked my wrist once with her thumb before removing her hands and straightening her faded pink scrubs. “I didn’t take part in the ritual, he did that on his own, but I know it worked. I got pregnant.” “With my brother?” “yes” she smiled.

  
“It wasn’t until I read the book later that I discovered there was a price to pay. The price differs with every request, depending on what you need granted.” “What was your price” I asked leaning forward slightly. “Any subsequent children must be given to her” “What?!” I stammered “I’m a subsequent child... I..I... mean I’m a subsequent child!” “I know,” she murmured, her gaze dropping to the floor in shame. “It was never meant to be this way. After your father told me what the price would be, we promised each other that we wouldn’t have another child. We tried, truly we did.” She looked up at me, her eyes full of desperation, silently begging me to believe her sincerity. “You’d think it would be simple, not getting pregnant, but…” her voice faltered, “…she always finds a way.” “What way?” I asked “It doesn’t matter now, what matters is you were born, and we loved you. Your father loved you.” “What happened to my dad Shannon?” I couldn’t bring myself to call her mum. At this point I was still quite sure Beacon Point Sanatorium was the best place for her.

 I could see this caused her pain, but I was done listening to stories. She continued regardless “She made a mistake. The deal your dad made was between him and her. For the ritual to work in her favour we both had to be present at the summoning so that I could agree to the terms. But I wasn’t.” “Then what happened” I muttered half-heartedly. “The fortune teller that give your father the book helped us. She knew a spell; she helped us rewrite the terms. Sort of like a cosmic solicitor” she chuckled dryly. “This isn’t funny” I shot back “you killed my dad! I’ve grown up alone Shannon!” She slammed her palm on the table shocking my tears away. “It’s because of that man you got to grow up at all!” she growled. “He sacrificed his life for you! He took your place!” “Yeah. And what...? now he’s a fucking bird!?” She settled back into her seat. Resigned “she gave me a solid story. But I chose the truth.” “What!?” I stammered, exasperated. “Find Morrigan.” She whispered, defeated. “She will give you what you’re looking for” Her shoulders sagged as if the weight of the years finally pressed her down, the fight gone from her eyes. I stared at her, the words settling uneasily between us, thickening the air with a grief that tasted almost metallic. I wanted to scream, to demand sense from her rambling, but something in her expression, some fractured hope, kept me silent. Shannon no longer looked like stranger spinning tales; she looked like someone who had lost everything and was begging for a chance to make things right. The clock in the hallway ticked on, indifferent to the ruins she’d laid before me, and I realised that whether I wanted it or not, the story wasn’t finished. [Not yet.](https://youtu.be/QRy-gJSkOs0)
