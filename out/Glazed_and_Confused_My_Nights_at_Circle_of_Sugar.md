It's morning now as I type this out. I am trying to beat the sun and get into bed before the first rays of dawn slither through my blinds and confuse my circadian rhythm. The curse of night shift. My nights typically start at nine pm and end by about five in the morning. Always dependent on how sloppy the shift went. Last night was one of those nights. Our patrons I deliver to found out it was my last week and were none to happy to hear about it.  I work for a donut shop, circle of sugar donuts to be exact. Best coffee and maple bars in the county. We even put bacon on some of the maple bars. Our bakers really love to experiment and its one of the reasons we have been in business for so long. My personal favorite is our brown butter cinnamon glazed rings. Those things sell out fast. Don't even get me started about our coffee, but I digress.

Circle of sugar is an great place to work don't get me wrong. I really have enjoyed my time here but I just have to follow my dreams. I will be going to film school next semester in a state far away from this place. I just felt like telling people about the reality of what is going on up here is something I had to do. I am leaving out the specific locations for everyone's safety. I don't want some savvy reddit detectives opening a door their not necessarily prepared to close. Though in all reality if someone dug deep enough they could figure out where the delivery route leads.

I suppose I should start from the beginning to paint a better picture. This was one of those jobs where you heard about it through a friend of a friend. They never placed ads for the position. I learned this was because they wanted someone who could directly vouch for the person applying. The interview was definitely one of the strangest I had ever been through. I showed up early in my best outfit and was greeted by the barista. She had me take a seat and offered me a free which I gratefully took. The front of the store was your typical donut shop. Bright pink boxes, shining polished display glass holding an array of sugared jewels of all shapes and sizes. A tip jar full to the brim. Bright eyed teenagers helping customers who lined out the door. Busy place, a good sign that I had chosen a decent place to work.

"Bill?" A man in an apron stained with chocolate frosting stood with my resume in is hand.

"Yes Hello sir." I replied

"Call me Frank, pleasure to meet you Bill lets head back to my office."

I shook his immense calloused hand trying and failing to match his grip.

The hallway was the first indicator of how strange this job was going to get. Various symbols were painted along the walls in a red color that looked like rust. Circles in circles with zigzag patters and what looked like Hebrew written along the outer rings. Dolls made of flowers and bones hung from certain parts of the ceiling. We passed an opening to the kitchen where several bakers stood around a table working a pile of dough all looking up at me as I passed. I swore the dough looked like it was moving around at first glance.

"Right in here Bill."

We turned into a small room before I could be sure. It was the size of a small closet and cluttered with papers, empty pink donut boxes still un-assembeled and wrapped in plastic, a wall of security camera monitors and a huge cabinet with two doors closed behind the chair of Franks desk. We both took a seat and went through the typical back and forth of a normal interview. Frank seemed pleased with my responses and sighed deeply before opening a drawer in his desk and pulling out a non de-script bottle of brown liquid.

"Bill would you join me in having a drink?"

I froze, the question making me stutter out "A drink?"

I wondered if this was some sort of test. As if reading my mind Frank said "Don't worry this is not a test I just like loosening up a touch with my new hires to get to know them better."

I nodded, slightly nervous at the prospect. This was beyond odd but I really did want this job. The town I'm in doesn't have a ton of prospects and the pay was the best I had seen in a long time for a simple delivery job.

"Sure why not." I said smiling in a way that probably communicated my apprehension.

He poured us both a glass and we clinked our glasses before shooting back the harsh liquid. It was whiskey I assumed. It tasted a little watered down but still burned as it made its way to my stomach.

Frank stared at me smiling for an uncomfortable amount of time. I started to think it actually was a test, one which I had failed miserably.

"Bill do me a favor can you hold out your hand for me?"

"What, uh, yeah." I replied dumb founded before holding my hand out across the desk. Frank reached back in a nook of his clutter desk and retrieved a salt shaker. While maintaining eye contact he began sprinkling salt in my open hand before quickly pulling back as if it would explode. I began to sweat nervously thinking I had made a grave mistake and my prospective employer was a complete nutjob.

After a time he relaxed and said "Excellent, OK good, you can just toss that down."

"I'm sorry but that *was* actually all a test and you passed. We can move onto the second part of the interview your doing great Bill."

I sheepishly dropped the salt and wiped my hands together to get the rest off.

"What kind of test? This is all a little odd sir, with all due respect."

Frank looked down at my resume skimming through, "To make sure your human."

"Human? Do you get a lot of non humans applying for this job?" I asked in a tone I regretted as soon as it came out of my mouth.

"You would be surprised. Just bear with me a little longer Bill I understand the strangeness of all this but It will make sense as we finish out. If by the end you don't want the job no hard feelings OK?"

I nodded slowly, curious as to where this was actually going.

Frank began a series of rapid fire questions.

Do I believe in the paranormal? Have I ever encountered a non human entity? Do I believe in other dimensions? What is your experience with occult practices?

I guessed I was answering correctly by Franks nods and continuous smile. We finished the questions and Frank leaned back pouring another shot.

"You don't have to have another if you don't want one Bill. It's just jack daniels watered down with holy water nothing to crazy."

I felt curious to hear what he had to say next but also plotting my escape from this office and out into the safety of my car.

"The job is yours if you want it but I need to explain a few things. You will be assisting the bakers for the first half of your shift, frying and prepping dough. The second half will be delivering orders across and out of town in our truck. We also have a menu which is not available to the public. It caters to a clientele who need certain requirements. Our job is to keep that specific clientele happy in order to keep the public safe. We make and sell donuts here but we are also part of an organization. One which has been around for as longer than I can tell you. We help to keep the shadows satiated so to speak. Now I understand this is a lot but I can guarantee this is all very real. As I said the job is yours if you are still interested but I cant go into much more detail unless you take the position. So what do you say Bill, is this something you are interested in?"

I sat under the weight of what he had just said. I didn't feel as though he were lying. His confidence and casual manner of speaking about it all made me believe him. It was all weird but if I am being honest this was the most interesting thing I had ever come across in our boring little sleepy town. I wanted to know more, even if it all was a huge hoax my curiosity was peaked, and there was something I just really liked about Frank.

"I accept the position."

Frank grinned ear to ear reaching out his massive hand. We shook and hammered out the details for when exactly I would start.

Frank explained "I will be the one to train you on the routes and our head baker Charlene will train you on the baking and prep."

"Can you explain more about the whole shadowy organization menu thing, I mean that is a lot right?"

Frank laughed nodding "Yes I will get more down to the nitty gritty on your first night. It would be better if we discussed it when you meet Charlene and get out on the route."

With that I took the job. I'm going to stop here guys as the sun is definitely starting to come up and I am exhausted. I will write in more soon here. It is nice to get this all out finally. Have a good one guys thanks for reading.
