As I got out of bed, I walked down the stairway and cooked me some breakfast; a mushroom omelette with a side of toast.

It was the busiest time of the year; parents doing last minute shopping, kids singing christmas carols, people watching movies. All of that. I thought it was a good time to go camping since most people camp out during the warmer days. Plus, I had a glamping tent I hadn't used yet.

When I finished eating breakfast I grabbed a notepad and read what I needed to bring:
1 Quart Canteen,

Portable Sattelite,

Sleeping bag,

Glamping Tent,

​Portable Wireless Heater,

Laptop,

Chips and Pancakes,

Lantern, and

Tent Lock.

After I got the last item off the list, I used the restroom before locking my house. When I got into the car I headed to the nearest gas station, there I bought a bag of chips.


As I was getting ready to check my items out I saw a peculiar looking old man. He had grey hair and a receding hairline. He looked as if he was in his 90s, he also had a red cashmere sweater, and slim green cargo pants. From what I could tell he had a crowbar and a black garbage bag in his hands.


I stared at him but got interrupted by the cashier's words of 


"That will be $5 and ¢30. And would you like a receipt?


I handed her the cash and told her no before promptly exiting the store.


As I was filling up my car with gas I saw that same old man from the store entering his rusty old blue pickup truck with the items he just bought in the store.


I shrugged it off and put the gas pump back and then proceeded to drive my car to the campground.


I was getting close to the park after a few hours of driving. When I entered the park I parked my car into the nearest parking space before grabbing my stuff from the back of my truck. I looked around and saw a toll booth and a bunch of other miscellaneous cars.

As I walked towards the toll booth I was greeted by the toll booth operator. I asked for the fee and he said that it was free today. 

"No wonder why there are so many cars" I thought to myself

From what I remember the operator said "Anyways, campsite twelve is still available. All you need to do is to walk straight until you come upon a fork in which you'll turn left and continue walking left until you spot another trail intersecting with the road you're walking on, go on that trail and it'll lead you to a vacant campsite."

I thanked him as he pushed a button open a gate into the forest, there I hiked towards my campsite. When I finished hiking towards my campsite I saw a beatiful arrangement of trees elegantly swaying in a back and forth motion while an orange bright sky lay upon it.

"Perfect" I thought

As I admired the scenery upon me, I started to set up my tent. I swung it around to get some air inside my tent. Then anchored the tent with the screws that came with it. After that I setup my sattelite and my internet. Next I put the sleeping bag, lantern, laptop, and​ the portable heater inside too. I grabbed the snacks and put them inside of the tent. Now I was ready to camp.

After I set up my campsite it was already nighttime, so I got into my tent and locked it with my trusty tent lock.

 While I was sleeping I felt thirsty so I woke up and got up to grab my ​canteen.

When I was drinking out of my canteen, I suddenly spotted a silhouette of a man that looked like it was holding a crowbar. I was unsure at the time because of my blurred vision. It looked like he was getting closer when he suddenly vanished...

My heart pounded as I waited in silence... Nothing...

I opened my laptop to call the police but there wasn't any internet services available.

I grabbed my lantern to go outside and check. I had to get the wifi back on...

So, I clenched my fists and prepared myself to fight just in case I had too as I slowly opened the tent lock and the tent's zipped door...

...

I saw nothing as I leaned towards to get a closer look...

Then I finally stepped outside but when I turned around, I saw what seemed like a dead corpse in a garbage bag hanged on a tree, it said "You're Next." written in blood on the garbage bag. When I saw that my heart skipped a beat as I jumped into my tent, zipping shut and locking my tent door. I curled up in a ball inside of my sleeping bag, sleeping the night out.

The next morning I woke up pondering what had just happened the night before.

I went outside and saw that the body was no longer there. I also saw the sattelite back to it's original spot which clearly wasn't there. Something was clearly wrong. But now that I have the internet again I can call the police. I called the police and they agreed they would come, but it would take a while and they will arrive at midday. So then I called the park's phone number and... They hung up.. 

Something bad was going to happen sooner or later so I immediately got all of my stuff and packed up my tent and ran back to my car. 

I forgot how and where to go so I accidentally went the wrong way when I reached the fork in the road again. When I walked up the other trail I saw a log cabin in the distance by a lake. What's weird I saw the same old rusty pickup truck at the gas station. I ran back the trail I was on and then headed to the right direction, I finally found the parking lot and the gates were open.

But when I stepped close...

....

The gates closed.

"You thought you could escape that easily?" croaked a mysterious voice out of nowhere.

Then the tollbooth operator suddenly appeared in my way...

"For years customers have mistreated me even though I was nice to them!" 

"I own this park so technically you're trespassing, and now I can finally get my revenge!"

Then a large clank was heard and the tollbooth operator collapsed.

Behind him stood the same old man carrying the same crowbar from the gas station.

"C'mon let's get ya home kid." said the old man

Before I could question it I was already in my car with the stuff in the back trunk.

"Don't worry I'll take care of him." He said

 As I drove off I saw the old man tie up the insane tollbooth operator while the sun was shining brightly. I thought the old man was the killer but that goes to show you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.

Weeks have past and I have been informed that the tollbooth operator has been sentenced to life and prison and that the old man now owns the park, taking place of the tollbooth now. I guess Christmas came early for me.
