Growing up I would always see things, nothing crazy as you may suspect but most of the time it was just shadows hanging out or moving through my peripheral vision. Now I am not an avid believer in the paranormal, so I just chalked it up to my "Imagination." During this time, I would also hear my name be called through the house, most of the time the voice sounded like my grandmother but calling out a loud "Yeah?" always netted me the response of "I didn't say anything." or "Why are you shouting?" again didn't think anything of it, I just went on with my day giving it little to no thoughts. For the most part I chalked it all up to being an effect of a lack of sleep, since during this time I did nothing more than binge video games all night and occasionally go out.

At this point ignoring all these feelings was easy, any time it would happen I would always tell myself, "Nothing has happened to me yet, it hasn't gotten worse, I haven't seen anything, or experienced anything that would strike me as being off." and that usually would have been the end of it, a few months go by this way, only this time it was different, it started as little things, you know, the usual "Where did my keys go?" type stuff, small things would just go missing and I could not for the life of me find them, it's funny, thinking back on it now, most of that stuff still to this day hasn't been found, again, my naivety told me that I am just forgetful, and being someone who can't remember what I had for breakfast yesterday that's all I told myself it was. 

Unfortunately for me this was only the beginning, it was a warm sunny summer and like usual I was bored out of my mind playing whatever new hit video game that was out, when I decided that video games just weren't cutting it, I called my friend Alan over so that we could hang out, make some popcorn watch some movies, just do anything that wasn't me isolating in my room, the rest of the day was uneventful so I won't bore you with the details of what we did, but you can probably imagine what two teenage boys did hanging out at the house with all the soda, food, and video games we could play. eventually the fun comes to an end and the day starts wrapping up, I pull up a spare bed and put it on the floor next to my bed and we both just pass out. I am not sure if it was due to a massive sugar crash, or from the fact we had a long day of loud fun. 

3 am rolls around and something wakes me up, I don't know what it was but, in that moment, something just drew my full attention to the open closet at the end of my room. I just sat and stared into the darkness for a good minuet or so, I didn't see anything, but whatever woke me had my full attention, after my trance is broken and I finally manage to pull my eyes from the closet I look over and notice that Alan was awake, and just like I had been doing something woke him up and drove him to look into the closet as well, I didn't know this till the next morning when I talked to him, here's what he said. "Man, I don't know what it was, but something woke me up last night, and instinctively drew my attention into the closet." Then it hit me, he had woken up in the same instance I had and stared into the closet at the same time I had. 

This was harder to rationalize but as I had stated earlier, I was extremely naive, I refused to give in to the creeping thoughts that something was going on, soon, I learned just how wrong I had been. Another month had passed at this point and the things I was experiencing had gotten worse, the shadows I was seeing no longer resided in my peripheral vision, I would notice a strange silhouette of a person standing in the room, sitting on the bed, even floating outside my second story window. I could no longer rationalize what I was seeing, but I told myself "After months of seeing whatever these things are they have never harmed me directly, if they had wanted to they would have already, not even an hour after thinking that I felt a strange thin burn going across my back, taking a look in the mirror I noticed three small scratches going down the length of my back.

This is where I finally started to worry, it was no longer small things going missing and shadow people popping in to say hi, stuff was falling over, I could hear cups and other like stuff falling to the floor from downstairs, I even heard the little cat bell I have hanging on the doorknob jingle as if something or someone was trying to open my door. I couldn't bring myself to sleep in that room anymore, so I usually ended up sleeping on the living room couch, I finally beat it, I didn't have to see or hear anything creepy if I never went into the room that it was happening in right? wrong, it was as if whatever was messing with me had gotten bored. Now my brother had a bedroom in the house, but it was downstairs, most of the "activity" took place in the upstairs bedroom. 

I was awoken by my brother who had come into the living room, it was obvious he was freaked out, hyperventilating, shaking, couldn't even form coherent sentences, but what he said when he finally caught his breath still haunts me even now, he had heard noises coming from the upstairs bedroom and assumed I was up there awake, right before he started treading up the stairs something caught his eye in the shadows of the upper hall. A tall shadow of a man was standing at the top of the stairs staring down at him, he said that it didn't have any features, eyes, nose, mouth, but even without any of that it was staring. Next to the tall shadow figure was another much smaller shadow, this one had horns. Now my family isn't very big on religion but seeing that unnerved him to the point where he started to pray, that was a bad call, whatever had been standing idle at the top of the stairs gave off a horrible rage filled aura.

Whatever it was had noticed him, and it was not happy, it wasn't happy he had seen it, and it especially wasn't happy he tried to pray it away. Slowly it took one step, then another, methodically sauntering down the stairs, which made my brother pray more, that's when it got bad. At the drop of a coin, it had nearly doubled its speed, blasting down the tall staircase and that's when he finally ran into the living room and coincidentally what woke me up. I am writing this now because at the current moment I am huddled up in my brother's room trying to calm him down, but there is a big problem, I don't know what to tell him or hell, even what I should do, I can feel the house shake gently, and the lights are now flickering, over the span of writing this story the shaking has become violent, and there is no more power, I was only able to get this story out because my phone still has data, it's now at one percent and everything is silent.

I don't know anything about what I am dealing with, but I do know one thing, it will never leave.
