We were hurtling west on Route 78, deep in the gut of Pennsylvania, running blind towards Ohio. Not for scenery. We were running. From the polite knocks of debt collectors that echoed wrong in our apartment stairwell, from the hollow resonance of the house where Chloe had spent eleven months watching cancer siphon the life from her mother. From grief that wasn't like mold—it was mold—a damp, pervasive chill clinging to our clothes, our lungs, the backs of our throats. A "fresh start," we called it, the phrase tasting like ash as we steered the rented U-Haul towing my wheezing Civic. Hope felt like contraband.

It was deep night. Maybe 2 AM. The hour the world thins, when highway lines blur into hypnotic tracers pulling you toward an oblivion whispering invitations. Chloe slept beside me, head canted against the vibrating window, her breath a soft counterpoint to the engine's drone. A small mercy, her unconsciousness. My own eyes felt scoured with sandpaper, fueled by gas station coffee curdling in my gut.

That's when the radio soured.

It had been snagging classic rock through static for an hour, normal for the terrain. But Pink Floyd didn't just fade—it dissolved. Smothered by static that wasn't crisp; it was thick, wet, like listening through pond scum. Beneath it, almost subliminal, a rhythm asserted itself. Slow, deliberate.

Thump-thump... pause... thump-thump... pause...

Not a heartbeat. Something larger. Deeper. Beating in the earth beneath the asphalt.

I stabbed at buttons, twisted the dial. Nothing but that viscous hiss, the deep pulse resonating through the plastic dash, vibrating in my teeth. I killed the radio, craving silence.

The silence that rushed in felt wrong. Heavy. Pressurized. My ears popped violently, a sudden descent. Mirrors showed miles of moon-bleached emptiness behind us. Ahead, only darkness. Yet, the hairs on my arms lifted. The intimate chill of cold breath on my neck. The illogical, primal certainty of being observed.

Through the windshield, the stars burned with unnatural clarity, too numerous, constellations I didn't recognize but felt disturbingly familiar, like half-remembered symbols from a fever dream.

Then, the engine sighed. A soft exhalation of power. Dashboard lights didn't flicker; they pulsed, once, hard, in time with that hidden beat, then died. I cursed, stomped the useless gas pedal. The engine didn't seize. It simply... ceased. Like a switch thrown miles away. The U-Haul glided, momentum bleeding away with terrifying smoothness, rolling to a dead stop on the shoulder, swallowed by the wilderness.

"Liam? What—?" Chloe startled awake, voice thick, face stark in the moonlight. The weight loss from mourning had sculpted her features into something fragile, almost translucent.

"I don't know," I managed, turning the key. Utterly dead. Not a click. "Engine just... stopped."

Panic bloomed, cold and metallic. Stranded. No cell service—confirmed an hour ago. Deep night. Nowhere.

"Okay," Chloe said, finding that brittle calm forged in hospital vigils. "Okay. Someone will come. A trucker. Trooper. It's 78."

We waited. Minutes stretched. An hour. Measured by my frantic pulse. Then another. The silence itself was the loudest thing. No crickets, no night birds, no rustling. Just the profound weight of the dark, pressing in. And beneath it all, felt more than heard, that rhythm from the radio—Thump-thump... pause...—vibrating up through the tires, humming in my fillings.

Chloe rubbed her temples, knuckles white. "This isn't right, Liam," she whispered, eyes huge, scanning the void. "Not one car? Not even distant lights? On 78?"

She was right. It was a major artery. Even now, semis should be thundering past. The emptiness felt deliberate. Curated.

Then I saw it. Not headlights. Faint, diffuse lights, shivering through dense trees maybe half a mile ahead, bleeding from a barely-there track peeling off the highway. A track I hadn't noticed, wasn't on any map. No sign.

"Look," I pointed, hope a weak, sputtering flare. "Lights. Town? Gas?"

Anything felt better than this waiting dark. "Stay here. Lock up," I said, grabbing the Maglite.

"No." Chloe grabbed her jacket, hand finding mine, grip tight. Her mother had coded while they were grabbing regrettable cafeteria coffee. She hadn't willingly left my side since. "Together."

The track was rutted dirt, hemmed in by trees whose branches interlaced like gnarled fingers. The air grew instantly colder, thick with the damp, loamy smell of recently disturbed earth. Like a fresh grave, the thought surfaced, unwelcome. With each step, the pulsing rhythm grew stronger, no longer just sensed but physically felt—a vibration rising through our shoes, synchronized with that hidden beat.

The lights resolved into a small, impossibly isolated town cupped in a hollow.

But the town... it was fundamentally wrong.

Like a scale model, disturbingly pristine. Picket fences too white, houses too symmetrical, windows glowing warmly but revealing no movement. No cars, no litter, no barking dogs, no TV murmur. Preserved under glass. And the silence... not absence of sound, but sound suppressed. Held down. Digested. The air itself felt thick, resistant.

The feeling of being watched intensified tenfold. Behind every flawless window, unseen eyes. Waiting.

A single building stood centrally lit: 'GARAGE', the faded sign declared. Lamplight spilled.

"Hello?" My voice sounded obscene, yet flat, absorbed by the dead air. No echo. "Anyone? Our truck... broke down on the highway."

The large garage door slid upwards with a pneumatic hiss eerily mirroring the radio static. A figure stood silhouetted. Tall, unnaturally thin, in greasy overalls.

He stepped into the light. His face was a roadmap of deep lines, eyes a pale, clouded blue, unfocused. He didn't look at us, but through us. A disturbing resonance to his features, a distorted familiarity, though I'd never seen him. His overalls seemed stained not just with grease, but with the darkness of the asphalt itself in places.

"Broke down?" His voice was a dry rustle, like snakeskin over sand, carrying that same damp, subterranean undertone as the static. "On the Route?"

"Yeah. Back on 78. Engine just... cut out."

He nodded, slow, ponderous, disconnected. Like a marionette settling. "Happens." He gestured vaguely back towards the unseen highway with a heavy wrench. "The Route... she gets peckish sometimes."

A memory surfaced—my grandfather, trucker, refusing certain stretches after sunset. "Some roads ain't just roads," he'd said, eyes distant. "Some got appetites." I'd dismissed it as road fatigue.

The mechanic's clouded eyes fixed on Chloe with uncomfortable intensity. His gaze lingered on the hollows beneath her cheekbones. "Pulls 'em right off the asphalt, she does. The ones carrying weight."

Chloe's fingers dug into my arm. "Can you help? Tow truck?"

A sound scraped from his throat, a dry, rattling approximation of a chuckle. "Tow truck won't help none. Not if the Route's taken a fancy." He looked towards the highway again, a flicker of recognition in those clouded eyes. "She's particular."

Ice traced my veins. "What are you talking about?"

"This stretch," he said, wiping grimy hands on an equally grimy rag, achieving nothing. "They call it Echo Canyon. Not on your maps." He tapped his ear lightly. "Things get... thin here. The seam between what was and what is." His gesture encompassed the surrounding town. "Folks stop. Or they get... stopped. And they... settle."

As he spoke, I became aware of others. Emerging silently from the perfect houses. Drifting onto porches, standing in doorways. Sharing that vacant stare, moving with disjointed grace. Some wore clothes fifty years out of date. One woman in a thin hospital gown shivered despite the still air. Another clutched a small teddy bear, tears streaming continuously down hollow cheeks. They weren't just standing; they were positioned, angled subtly toward the earth. As if listening. Waiting for instruction from below.

"The Route notices," the mechanic continued, gaze drifting. "Especially folks carrying something heavy." His eyes locked onto Chloe again. "Grief's got a... resonance. Draws the attention."

"This is insane," I whispered, but a cold dread recognized truth.

"Insanity's thinking highways are just concrete." His lips stretched into something like a smile, revealing teeth stained an oily black. "They're veins. Carrying things." He seemed to listen for a moment. "Some feed. Some... collect."

Chloe stiffened. "The rhythm," she whispered. "I feel it inside my head now."

The mechanic nodded, his movements suddenly smoother, synchronizing. "The pulse. You feel it, don't you?" He pressed a filthy hand against his chest. Thump-thump... pause... His eyes took on an unnatural shine. "The Route's voice. Whispering."

And I did hear it now. Not just felt. A low-frequency vibration from my own bones. As if it had always been there. Indistinct impressions formed in the pulse: Stay... Rest... Belong...

"What is this place?" Chloe breathed, gaze fixed on a woman across the street. Gaunt, hollow-cheeked, eyes lost... Dear God, the resemblance to Chloe's mother in the final weeks was sickeningly real.

"Rest stop," the mechanic said, lips pulling back further. Learned, not felt. "For the ones the Route holds onto. We keep things tidy. Wait."

"Wait for what?" My voice cracked.

"For... incorporation," he said, the word clinical, chilling. His face seemed to shimmer, like heat haze, something shifting beneath. The watchers rippled subtly in unison. "Your thoughts, fears. Your grief. It all... contributes. Stabilizes things." His voice dropped lower, "She's ancient. Older than the road, older than the trails. Been gathering since before wheels." He gestured at the townsfolk. "Some are echoes. Some are... integrating."

A woman with a jagged line across her throat stepped forward, movements fluid yet wrong. Her voice emerged not from her mouth but seemingly from the ground: "It's peaceful. No bills. No pain. No memory of the skid..." She tilted her head impossibly. "The Route remembers."

The mechanic turned back towards the garage's shadows. He glanced towards the highway, then specifically at where our U-Haul sat, unseen but known. He didn't speak, but his clouded eyes held a questioning look, a subtle inclination of his head towards the trailer carrying the Civic. The implication hung heavy in the dead air: Lighten the load, maybe?

Madness. But the alternative... staying here, becoming a vacant echo...

I felt a sudden, overwhelming compulsion. A desperate gamble. "Okay," I stammered. "The car. We'll leave the car." Before I could second-guess, I was turning back.

As we turned, his hand shot out, clamping onto my wrist. Cold as deep earth, dry, papery. Where he touched, faint, dark lines pulsed beneath my skin like ink in water, tracing my veins in complex patterns that throbbed with the rhythm.

"The Route's got a taste now," he whispered, breath fetid—oil, metal, damp earth. "Leaves a mark. Understand?"

I ripped my arm free, heart hammering. The lines receded, but a cold foreignness remained, circulating. "Chloe, let's go."

We practically ran back up the dirt track, the silence amplifying my frantic pulse, the unseen rhythm seeming to throb louder. Behind us, the town and its residents remained, motionless sentinels, outlines fraying slightly at the edges, blurring into the dark.

My hands shook unlocking the Civic. Tossed the keys onto the seat. As I slammed the door—the sound loud, yet instantly swallowed—I swore I saw a flicker inside, a deepening shadow in the passenger seat. Settling in. Wearing the faintest suggestion of a face—my father's. Gone when I blinked. A trick of moonlight and fear.

Back in the U-Haul, air thick with terror, I jammed the key in. Twisted.

The engine roared to life. Aggressively loud.

No hesitation. Slammed it into drive, floored it, tires spitting gravel onto the highway asphalt. I refused to look back, didn't dare check mirrors. But peripherally, a glimpse—the mechanic, standing in the middle of Route 78, watching us recede. He raised one hand slowly. Acknowledging. Marking.

"Did... did that happen?" Chloe whispered, trembling, bleached white. "Liam, his face... just before we got in... did you see it shift?"

I hadn't dared look. "Drive," I gritted out. "Focus. Drive."

We pushed the complaining U-Haul. But the highway felt... elastic. We passed a uniquely twisted oak—then passed it again ten minutes later. Mile markers counted down, then jumped back up. The dashboard clock flickered: 2:17 AM... 2:17 AM... 2:17 AM. The feeling of being watched became invasive—a feeling of being digested.

The radio clicked on. Volume knob useless.

Static flooded the cab, thick, choking, smelling faintly of ozone and decay. And the pulse. Thump-thump… pause… THUMP-THUMP… pause… Pressure, vibrating the steering wheel, resonating in my sternum, shaking my teeth.

Whispers writhed within the static. Fragmented, sibilant. Not direct accusations, but echoes. Familiar voices, warped. "...running from..." like Chloe's mother's sigh, "...so hungry..." a dry rasp, like the mechanic's, "...stay with us..." a chorus, hollow, "...the bills... fear..." my own anxieties, twisted back, "...mother's echo..." a weeping sound, "...taste lingers..."

Chloe whimpered, hands over ears. "Make it stop, Liam! Please!"

Hammering the radio was futile. The whispers sharpened, weaving our rawest emotions into the static tapestry. The Route wasn't just listening; it was sampling. Archiving.

Beside me, Chloe went rigid. Her head turned, slowly, unnaturally smoothly, until she faced me. Her eyes seemed filmed over, reflecting dead dashboard lights like polished stones.

"It's inside now, Liam," she said, and the voice was a grotesque overlay—her pitch, the mechanic's rasp, the wet static hiss. "The Route. It... likes this place." Her gaze drifted downwards towards her own lap. "It chose."

Her face began to... waver. Less shifting, more like a faulty projection. Flashes of the mechanic's lines, the vacant townspeople's stare, a horrifying glimpse of her mother's final emaciation. Then, impossibly, a flash of my father's features—a man Chloe never met. The face from the Civic's shadow.

Ahead, the road shimmered, distorting like extreme heat haze. Asphalt seemed to liquefy, white lines writhing. The truck veered sharply, the wheel fighting me with intelligent force.

"It's pulling us back!" I screamed, as Chloe's hand clamped onto mine—inhumanly strong, cold as the mechanic's touch.

Through the wavering mirage, shapes resolved. Tall, gaunt figures. Dozens. Standing stock-still, faces indistinct blurs of static, all oriented towards us. The townsfolk. The mechanic at their head. Waiting. Welcoming. Among them, my breath hitched—a woman with Chloe's mother's posture. A man with my father's slump. Collected echoes. And worse—a figure with my own stance, watching our approach with patient hunger.

The U-Haul surged, accelerating uncontrollably, drawn towards the assembly. Brake pedal solid, useless. The pulse from the radio reached a deafening crescendo, shaking the cab violently. THUMP-THUMP… THUMP-THUMP… THUMP-THUMP…

"It wants us!" I yelled.

Beside me, Chloe's face contorted. "We can rest here, Liam," grated that composite voice. "All the pieces... gathered. Makes us whole again." She gestured vaguely to her stomach. "Makes space..."

Then, a flicker. Behind the cloudy film, Chloe's true eyes—terrified. Fighting.

Blind panic. Primal survival. I wrenched the wheel, aiming not for the road, but the ditch, the treeline, anywhere off the asphalt. The thing wearing Chloe's face shrieked—oscillating between human anguish and electronic feedback.

Metal screamed. The unseen trailer jackknifed. Steel groaned, glass imploded. We hit the soft shoulder, jarring every bone, then plowed headlong into the dark woods. Branches exploded like gunshots. A vortex of green and black. Then silence slammed down.

...

I woke hanging upside down, held by the seatbelt, cab crumpled. Acrid gasoline, crushed pine. Beside me, Chloe moaned—alive. Her eyes, fluttering open, were hers. Clear. Human. Terrified.

Distant sirens grew closer. Real sirens.

They found us near dawn, tangled twenty miles off Route 78, deep down an embankment. No tracks led from the highway. U-Haul totaled. The trailer and Civic? Vanished. Gone. Troopers exchanged baffled looks. One veteran, silvering hair, kept glancing back at the highway with an expression I recognized—unease. Like he knew something but wouldn't say it.

As they loaded Chloe into the ambulance, I noticed something. Each paramedic, each officer—their movements occasionally synced. Just for a beat. A collective pause. A rhythm. Thump-thump... pause...

We told them the lie. Swerved for a deer. Lost control. What else?

Chloe: fractured collarbone, concussion, shock. Me: cracked ribs, bruises, stitches.

In the hospital, a nurse changed Chloe's IV at 2:17 AM. The drip pulsed with her monitor. Thump-thump... pause... When I pointed, she smiled—eyes vacant for a second—and told me to rest. The intake forms had glitches in the timestamps, strange formatting errors around Route 78.

We made it to Ohio. Eventually. Cramped apartment, soul-crushing jobs. Assembling a "fresh start" from broken pieces. We never speak of that night. The town. The mechanic. The whispers. The price.

But the silence here is thin.

Late at night, city hum low, I feel it. Faint, rhythmic thrumming. Deep background noise. Thump-thump… pause… thump-thump… pause… Sometimes I feel it in my healed ribs, a phantom vibration.

Sometimes, fleeting movement at vision's edge—tall, gaunt, gone. Textures shimmer. Construction pile drivers sometimes sync perfectly for one beat too many. Ice floods my veins.

Maps. Satellite images of Route 78. Sometimes, a suggestion in the terrain—a vast shape, articulated, the highway a vein feeding something ancient, patient. Blink, it's gone.

Chloe feels it too. I see it. She freezes, head cocked, listening. Eyes glaze over, reflecting something unseen. Murmurs in sleep, voice raspy, low, not quite hers.

And my dreams: back in that pristine, dead town. Walking immaculate streets among silent watchers. Waiting. The mechanic leans against his workbench, wiping endless grease. That dead smile. "Told you," he rasps, filling my sleeping mind. "Nothing ever really leaves the Route clean." I wake tasting engine oil and grave dirt.

We escaped. We left the offering. But the Route didn't just want the car. It got a taste. Sampled our static, fear, grief. Planted an echo. A seed.

Last week, Chloe confirmed it. Pregnant. Against odds, against doctors' predictions. There on the grainy ultrasound. A tiny flicker. Nascent heartbeat.

Thump-thump… pause…

Clear on the monitor. Perfectly in time with the rhythm in my bones.

The technician performing it—her eyes, just a moment, clouded. Her voice, briefly static-tinged, whispered: "Strong rhythm for this stage. The... area... seems pleased." She remembered nothing when I questioned her frantically. The printout of the scan seemed slightly blurry around the edges, almost vibrating.

Sometimes, I feel unseen eyes looking back. From shadows, maps, the ink itself. Listening. Waiting.

It remembers us. Thump-thump… pause… It knows where we are. Thump-thump… pause… And I feel it growing stronger. Nearer. Coming to collect.

Last night, I woke. Chloe stood at the window, staring towards the distant interstate, hand absently stroking her still-flat stomach. She turned, eyes catching the streetlight—clouded, milky, unfocused.

"It's calling us home, Liam," she whispered, voice layered with static. "It misses us. It needs... what's growing."

Her other hand, pressed against the glass, left a smear—not fingerprints. A map. The exact route from here back to that stretch of 78. Directions written in condensation on a warm night.

By morning, she remembered nothing. Just tired, she said.

I'm researching. Echo Canyon. Hungry roads. Thin places. Old forums: electrical failures, missing time, strange towns on PA highways. Obscure journals: Native warnings about paths where the land itself hungers. Where echoes gather.

I don't know what's growing inside Chloe. If it's ours anymore. But we can't stay still.

Yesterday, car keys rearranged on the counter. Outline of Pennsylvania. Today, GPS reroutes every destination through Route 78. Won't clear. Tonight, writing this, a truck idles outside. U-Haul. No driver visible.

I've looked at the bedroom doorway three times while writing this. Each time, Chloe stood there briefly, watching—except the third time, it wasn't quite Chloe. The silhouette was wrong. Too tall. The proportions stretched. In its hand, dangling, a set of keys. The idle truck outside revved once, in perfect time with the pulse in my wrist.

Thump-thump… pause…

I'm going to the window now. The U-Haul's back doors are open. I can see something inside—a shadow, person-shaped, beckoning. It's standing in front of what looks like our Civic. Impossible. The shadow has my father's posture. Behind it, more shadows. Waiting.

The keys on my desk just moved. By themselves. Pointing to the door.

It wants us back. Or rather, it wants what it started in us.

I hear Chloe in the bathroom. Running water. Humming something arrhythmic that periodically syncs with the pulse.

Thump-thump… pause…

I should run. But where? The Route is patient. It has mapped every artery of this country. And now, it's mapped us.

Thump-thump… pause… Thump-thump… pause…
