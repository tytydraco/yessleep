They say you should never cry wolf and, boy, were they right. I just didn’t think a lie so innocuous could have such devastating consequences for those around me.

I was from San Berardino, possibly the most boring town in human existence. That’s how it always felt to me growing up there. 

There were never any tornadoes like there were rolling across the plains of the Midwest, not any floods like those surging over a coast in the Southeast, nor wildfires like the ones burning through forests in the Southwest. No real risk of any of that in San Berardino, which I suppose I should have been grateful for.

But, instead, I would always feel a pang of jealousy seeing my cousins and family friends around the country—and globe—marking themselves as “Safe” from various climate upheavals. Why couldn’t my place of residence ever get the spotlight? The online feature, implemented on a social networking site to allow users an easy way to quell their loved ones’ fears, was only accessible when your geographical zone was in crisis.

Meaning, it never ever popped up for me, no matter how much time I spent scrolling on my newsfeed or posting about my day.

That was, however, until the day Facebook randomly presented this feature to me. 

I’d been lying in bed on a school night, doing what I usually do up late: hanging out on social media. That’s when I saw the little blue prompt pop up at the top of my newsfeed, grabbing my attention seconds after I’d refreshed the page.

“Are you safe?” asked the prompt, followed by three boxes, one in green saying “I’m safe”, one in white saying “I”m not in the area” and—curious as ever—one in red saying “I”m unsafe”.

My first thought was that it had to be some joke page my friends had hacked into the site. I assumed it was this, and not a simple glitch, because of the text above it.

*“The San Berardino Downfall: You appear to be in an area affected by the San Berardino Downfall.”*

*Downfall?* From the privacy of my dark bedroom, I let out a laugh. What a hoot. Taking the piss out of this lame town was something that never got old. 

No matter how much I refreshed the page, the prompt didn’t go away. It seemingly wouldn’t until I selected a response. I could have truthfully replied “Yes”, or reasoned that I “wasn’t in the area”, or simply not responded. But I wanted to play into the joke. People would clearly know I was joking. What was the harm in it? What else was a “downfall” supposed to be besides a gag? It might as well have been called the San Berardino Bellyflop. 

With a chuckle, I clicked “No”. The prompt instantly changed to a status update on my profile page.

*“Harry has marked himself as Unsafe from the San Berardino Downfall.”*

It didn’t take long for it to get a few reactions from my Facebook friends, mostly in the form of likes or laugh reactions. The comments were great too.

“No need for a downfall, this town is already a hole haha” typed one of my local friends.

“Clearly fake, San Berardino couldn’t get any worse lol” replied another friend who had long since moved away.

I woke up still amused by the jokes. As I hadn’t got my license yet and only lived a bit over a mile away, I walked to school as I did most mornings, taking in the sight of my dull but pleasant-looking town. I did, however, notice one thing that I didn’t see most mornings.

A hairline crack in the pavement behind me.

I had stopped to tie my shoelace and, as I bent down, saw the small crack behind my foot. It might have stretched down the whole length of pavement I’d walked here on—although surely that wasn’t the case. With a superstitious chuckle about stepping on a crack breaking my mother’s back, I stepped past it and continued my way to school. The town council needed to better upkeep our roads.

But a minute later, instinctively, I looked back at the grey pavement behind me.

The crack was still there. My chest tightened slightly in perplexed unease. I’d studied that crack earlier and it had only gone up to my foot, not ahead of me.

This meant the crack splitting itself across the pavement had followed me all these feet.

No, that couldn’t be true, I told myself, getting up again and forcing myself to walk these concerns off. I must not have seen the crack in the ground correctly. When I looked back again at the crack after a few more minutes of walking, my reassurances changed.

Actually, the pavement must be really fragile and is cracking under my footsteps. That’s it. Gosh, I must have put on a few pounds. I continued my stroll to school, walking a bit faster than I normally would and looking over my shoulder a lot more than I would too.

Was it just my eyesight or had the crack gotten slightly bigger?

Arriving at my high school, I was happy to finally step off that strip of pavement and head inside the building. I stuffed my backpack in my locker, grabbed my books, shut the door and—in the process—looked down. 

My stomach lurched. There was that same crack, stretching out behind me, down the hall and outside of the school—probably connecting with that same pavement crack that had followed me inside.

It was maybe a millimeter or two bigger at this point, and could be seen on the vinyl flooring without much trouble. That was another thing. Vinyl flooring. I could understand cracking a worn down bitumen pavement. But brand new durable vinyl?

My mind could barely focus during my first classes. On my walk to first period, I’d kept my head trained on the crack as I’d walked and—for the first time—I’d seen the unthinkable: the crack cross-crossing across the ground in real time, in my stead.

This mysterious crack in the ground was *stalking* me before my very eyes.

I dashed ahead to my class to get a jump on the crack—but sitting at my desk, while my geography teacher droned on, I had a front row view of its return. Like the tortoise catching up the hare, that unstoppable crack split its way under the classroom door and across the floor in my direction. It took place over the course of minutes, so I was the only one to notice it. But it was clear as day.

And like before, when it reached me, the crack halted its progress and waited for my next move. I fast learned that it wasn’t bound to the Earth either—the crack had no issue following me up the stairs to the upper floors. It made no sense geologically.

“You sound like you’re *on* crack, buddy” my friends dismissively told me at first when I tried to alert them. We were standing in line at the cafeteria and I couldn’t hold in my panicked observations any longer.

“The proof is right there, just look at it!” I shouted pointing over my shoulder at where I knew the crack would be. People stared awkwardly at my outburst but I didn’t care. Their attention would soon be on something else as their gaze followed my outstretched arm.

“Holy crap, this public school really is in shambles,” gawped my friend Al, dropping his tray and jumping out of line.

A commotion broke out in the cafeteria as all the students finally registered the crack in the ground, now a centimetre in width and a few steps behind me in line. Regardless of whether or not people noticed it was trailing me, it was now unmistakably present.

Before long, we were all evacuated to the parking lot outside of the school. Teachers had noticed the cracks spanning the upper levels—courtesy of my classes up there—and identified them as a clear safety hazard. With the structural integrity of the high school in question, classes for the entire day were cancelled.

The mood in the parking lot was jubilant. Not only were we going home early, but there was chaos to talk about. Nothing ever happened in San Berardino, yet now it seemed as if our very school was going to fall down.

*Fall down.*

There, in the chattering crowds under the bright midday sunshine, I finally connected the two events. The strange, ominous crack that had been following me and expanding all day—and the strange, ominous Facebook joke post that I’d made about being Unsafe from the San Bernadino Downfall. I’d posted that I was in danger from it, and now…

The joyous energy of relief around me at evacuating the school was abruptly cut short. I was also shook out of my moment of revelation. What did this was the terrifying, surreal sight of the crack rapidly splitting its way across the parking lot asphalt right in front of everyone. It was now an inch wide—wide enough to make a rumbling noise—and moved several paces every few seconds. Fast enough to cause instant panic.

It was now abundantly clear in the crowded light of day that the crack was headed in the direction of one thing: me.

I wasn’t gonna stick around to say “I told you so”. I was already off before the crowd pandemonium could erupt, frantically running home on the opposite pavement that I’d walked here on.

Stopping and letting the moving crevice catch up was no longer an option for me. Each time I glanced back at it in mid-sprint, it had widened in diameter. It grew from an inch to inches, and then from inches to a foot. It felt like something out of an Indiana Jones movie, and here it was happening to me in real life.

Somehow, I made it back to my house in a few minutes and with a 20 second gain on the chasm. I would need it for what I was about to do. I’d had time to formulate my plan down to the second on the dash home and wouldn’t have a moment to slip up. 

I burned several seconds unlocking the door before leaping up the stairs to my parents’ bedroom. That’s where I knew Dad kept the keys to his truck. My mom had been dropping him at work and picking him up everyday in her car while he was recovering from knee surgery, before driving to her own job. This saving grace is what granted me the slim chance to escape.

As I dove across the landing and threw open my parents’ bedroom door, I heard the crack catch up to me. The sounds of the front porch shattering apart echoed from downstairs, and then the entryway, and then the staircase.

Harried, I tore through the dish on their dressing table, then their bedside table drawer, and finally the hamper by their closet. A jarringly loud crunch and shudder told me that the crack had reached the landing. If the keys weren’t in this jeans pocket, I was done for.

They were there.

Not wasting a second to look back, I did what I’d planned to and jumped straight out the upstairs window. With a roll, I spun myself off the roof and onto the soft grass below relatively unscathed. I didn’t have time to catch my breath. Like I’d stood up that same morning when I’d discovered that crack, I hauled myself to my feet, unlocked the truck and turned the key in the ignition.

Just as I hit the pedal, I heard a far louder noise than an engine behind me. In the rear view mirror, I saw the unworldly sight of my family’s atrophied house collapsing on itself, having been split in two and gutted by the encroaching crevice. As I accelerated onto the road, I thanked my stars that no one had been inside at least.

Now I was racing down my neighbourhood street, faster than I’d ever dreamed of driving. Was it 60 miles per hour? 70? 80? My attention was consumed almost entirely by the ear-rattling destruction on my heels.

Destroying my house hadn’t sated the speeding crack, now a meters-wide abyss that split apart the asphalt road like the crack of doom. Water pipes burst, chunks of rubble flew, traffic lights collapsed and people screamed and darted out of the way to avoid falling into the void. I didn’t look back for long enough to see if they managed it.

The only thought in my mind was to get out of town—to outrun this crack somehow.

So, I sped my way onto the exit highway for San Bernadino, a curving road boxed in by the mountains framing our town. The constantly turning nature of the road meant that I kept seeing the crack popping up my rear view mirrors. As the road finally straightened out and I began to move away from the town, the chasm still hot on my trail, I finally began to accept that I would die. Me and my car would be consumed by the ditch and god knows what lay below it.

Then came a notification beep from my phone. 

One-handed—the situation couldn’t be any unsafer—I opened my iPhone and saw the Facebook notification.

*“Are you safe from the San Bernadino Downfall now?”*

I had nothing to lose. Still wildly speeding away, I tapped the little button that said “Yes”. It was counterintuitive, but it made sense to me.

And it worked.

The second my status update went live, the crashing sounds of the racing abyss ceased. I looked in the rear mirror and saw the crack moving further and further away from me in the distance. It had stopped.

I still put a few miles between me and it before I stopped the car. Shakily, I got out of my truck and looked at the San Berardino skyline. That cursed Facebook feature had started this, and it had ended it. 

Or so I thought.

Suddenly, a crumbling sound louder than any before rang out across the landscape. Had the crack lulled me into false security by stopping? No. Instead, before me, the very silhouette of the town I’d looked down on began to sink downwards. In one solid piece, the building, roads and people began to fall into the ground itself—like a paper cutout someone had cut around the outline of.

My insides seized with horrified understanding worse than ever today. The exit road to the town had wrapped around the town itself due to surrounding terrain. In my panicked escape, I’d inadvertently led the chasm around the town in my truck, destroying its foundations and letting it be swallowed up like I feared I’d be.

Nowadays, a deep crater is all that remains of San Berardino. No survivors—not my parents, not my friends—were ever found in the rubble. The town where nothing happened had *this* happen.

All that’s left of it are Facebook posts like that one I made, marking myself Safe.

Mercifully, no one knows the role I played in wiping my town off the map. Experts blamed it on an undiscovered tectonic fault line beneath Oregon, but mostly just buried the story alongside the town. To this day, people still comment on that “Marked Safe” post of mine, praising my escape as the sole survivor of the San Berardino Downfall.

I don’t read those comments though. I don’t go on Facebook much at all anymore—for understandable reasons.
