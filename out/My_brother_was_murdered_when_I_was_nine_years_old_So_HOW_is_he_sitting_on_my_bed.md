When I was a kid, Jem played dolls with me every day. 

I’d come home from kindergarten, and he’d already be setting up Barbie and her friends in the dreamhouse. 

Mom was always working, so Jem kind of took the place of my honorary parent. 

I remember him always giving me candy when I wasn't technically allowed it before dinner, the two of us snacking on chips and chocolate, watching our favorite TV shows. 

I don't think Jem *liked* iCarly. But he pretended to. 

Jem was fun to play with. 

I remember he was always so excited to give my dolls new hairstyles, taking them *very* seriously. 

He named each of them, gave them personalities, jobs, hobbies— he even went a little existential. 

When we had played every single scenario he could think of, Jem insisted on, “Barbie goes to Heaven” and “Barbie doesn't know what happens after dying, so she just sits on the edge of her pool and goes through her best memories.”

Jem was a *storyteller*. 

Mom said he was talented. 

His school sent him awards in the mail for creative writing contests. 

But when people asked him, “When are you writing a book?” he just shrugged, insisting on injecting his creativity into playing with me. 

Okay, so it wasn't *all* perfect. 

Jem and I were siblings, so we fought and fell out, and reluctantly made friends over the dumbest shit. 

I was very protective of my dolls, and when he left one of them outside in the swimming pool, I threw a fit. 

But again, I was eight. This is to be expected of an eight year old. But the thing is, we always made up. 

He was my brother, of course we did. 

Mom was basically MIA for the majority of my childhood. Jem was the reason why I wasn't lonely— why I continued to play with dolls, even when the kids at school teased me for being childish. 

Jem didn't just play with me. 

He created stories for these dolls worth remembering. 

Like, Barbie and Ken go to Walmart. Which sounds stupid, but Jem could spin any story in a completely different direction. 

They went to Walmart, yes, but then they were abducted by aliens, and Ken was cloned, the real Ken turned into an asshole. I don't remember the specifics of the story, but I *do* remember it. 

His stories left an impression on me. 

I wanted to be a writer like him, follow his footsteps, and create my own Barbie tales. 

But, all good things come to an end– or in this  case, they abruptly stop. 

When Jem turned seventeen, I was nine years old. 

That's a big age gap. 

I was still playing with dolls, and he was coming home late, going to parties, and locking me out of his room. 

Which are all relatively normal things for a high school senior. 

Jem got mean. Like, *really* mean. 

He started calling me names, throwing things at me when I asked him to play with me, and teasing me for playing dolls. 

Look, I don't know why I liked playing with dolls at that age. 

There's nothing wrong with it, and it anything, it wasn't the *dolls* I was having fun with. 

It was the stories I was making myself. 

All young siblings copy their older siblings, and I was obsessed with becoming just like my brother— or even better. 

Dad said it was a disease called the *teenage plague*, making seventeen-year-olds “too mean” to play with their eight-year-old siblings. 

He was right. 

Jem started bringing friends over, and I didn't like them. 

There were two boys and a girl. 

Reece, this guy with glasses, a face full of acne, and a lisp. 

He was the nicest, often chastising (in a teasing way) my brother, for telling me to fuck off. 

His other friends were assholes. 

Clee, who I'm pretty sure he was dating, a ponytail brunette, who was way too condescending and treated me like I was half my age. 

Wylan was probably the most memorable, mostly because he blew smoke in my face. 

I was eight years old, and he kind of looked like a Jonas Brother, so I had a mini crush on him. 

That didn't stop him blowing smoke in my face every time I walked into my brother’s room. 

There was one night, when Jem’s friends weren't there, and I took my chance. 

I had been waiting to play dolls with him, ever since he promised to, on account of me promising not to tell Mom about the weed stashed under his pillow. 

I hopped into his room, ignoring the sign: **“KEEP OUT. NO LOSERS ALLOWED.”**

Jem sat cross-legged on his bed, cigarette in his mouth.

All I wanted was to play dolls with him, to do *anything* with him. 

He was already dangerously close to eighteen years old, and I was scared I was losing my brother. 

I also wanted to show him I was good at storytelling too. 

Look, I guess I'm saying I wanted to be validated by him. 

So, I decided to remind Jem I knew exactly where his weed stash was. 

I remember being quite spiteful. I would do anything to get his attention. 

So, I sat directly on his pillow, where we both knew he had been “gardening”. 

Jem looked up from his laptop, where it looked like he was writing a story. 

He slowly pulled the cigarette out of his mouth, flicking it in an old can of Red Bull. 

We both knew exactly what I was silently threatening, and for a moment he looked oddly impressed, before remembering he was a teenager. 

“You *wouldn’t*.”

I only had to open my mouth to scream to Mom, and he lost all, and I mean *all* of his bravado. 

Little kids always have the side of the parent, and I knew Mom would immediately believe me. 

She had been paranoid about Jem’s friends for a while. 

Very suspicious of Wylan being a little *too* happy when they came over. 

And the most obvious, the stink of *weed* he tried and failed to filter out of his bedroom window. 

When I shouted for Mom, Jem dropped to his knees, eyes wide. 

There was *one* thing he was scared of, and that was losing all of his summer privileges before college. 

Mom wasn't scared of grounding a seventeen year old. 

Being grounded meant no hanging out, no smoking weed, and no Clee. 

I saw all of this in his expression, all of the *could-have-beens* he could miss out on, if Mom caught him. 

I remember he turned to pleading. “Wait, no, shit, I didn't mean it!” 

I didn't have to ask him. Jem already knew what I wanted. 

He stood slowly, scowling, like he was planning my murder. “Fine. I'll play one game of Primrose and Barbie—” 

I remember him hissing out when I hugged him. 

I was a kid, and my brother had FINALLY agreed to play dolls with me.

I was elated. Jem was pissed and reluctant, groaning the whole time. 

“Okay! All right, get off me, you're getting your little girl snot on me.” 

Jem grabbed my hand and I marched him into my bedroom, where the dreamhouse was already placed on my carpet. 

I thought I had to remind him how to play, and which doll was which. 

But when he sat down, Jem was already taking over the previous story, picking out the dolls he liked, positioning them. 

When I reached for Cindy, he snatched her from my hands. 

Cindy was one of his creations. 

She was deaf in one ear, could hear ghosts, and was dating Hanna, the lifeguard. “Nope. *I'm* always Cindy.” 

He held her up, tugging at her bright red hair he “dyed” when he was younger. “See? I gave her this hair.”

Jem effortlessly fell back into being the storyteller, and he was very clearly enjoying himself. I insisted we play one of my stories, and he was impressed. 

Well, he was impressed, but he didn't *say* because he was my brother. 

Jem just said, “You're kind of good. Maybe. Not better than me, though.”

We played Barbie Dreamhouse until bedtime, and he was reluctant to leave when Wylan came crashing into my room, demanding Jem come to a party. 

I expected Wylan to start laughing at Jem sitting there combing Cindy’s hair.

But he just nodded at me and said, “Cool dolls.”

I was hoping Jem would choose to stay with me, but it was my bedtime. 

Jem *promised* we would play every Wednesday after school– and he kept that promise. 

Every single week, Jem came home from school, threw down his bag and jacket, and said, “All right. So, which dolls are we playing with today?”

Some days (rarely) Wylan joined in. 

And let me tell you, it was surreal to watch an eighteen year old senior incredibly focused on styling a doll's hair. 

Wylan made me laugh. Even if he was a little crude. 

Jem was already planning our next adventures, already painting up half finished ideas for the whole story. 

“Ken needs a job,” he told me, while tucking me into bed. “All he does is sit around.”

So, I turned Ken into a factory worker. He made all the handbags. 

I was excited to play Barbie again. 

I came in one Wednesday, just after Jem’s senior prom. 

He was already talking about college, *but* had promised me he and Wylan were coming over to play with me.

I remember waiting hours. Mom got home and said, “Maybe he's at a party, sweetie.”

But then he wasn't at breakfast, and Mom started to call people. 

It wasn't until the following day when there was still no sign of him, and Mom was crying on the sofa, when I knew something was wrong. 

Do you know that *feeling* in the pit of your stomach that something bad has happened? 

I was nine at this point, and dolls had become more of a connection to my brother than an actual hobby. 

But I was old enough to understand why the cops were standing at our door, and *why* my Mom wouldn't get out of bed. 

Jem was missing, and I didn't know what to do. I felt helpless. 

Wylan had given me his phone number to call him in emergencies, but he wasn't answering me. 

I distracted myself with dolls. It was all I could do. These dolls and their stories were woven by my brother. 

They felt real. 

Alive. 

When I took them to school and hid them under my desk, kids didn't *laugh*, but they did whisper. 

Ella, a quiet girl who also played with dolls (and was bullied mercilessly for it) came up to me in class. I remember her smile. 

Ella felt like a breath of fresh air that I desperately needed. 

Ella poked at Cindy, who I was re-dressing. 

“Do you have any spare heads?” she asked, picking through my dolls.

I *did* have some spare doll heads. 

I couldn't find the bodies for them. 

“My parents got me a *big* dollhouse, but one of my Barbies needs a head.” 

Ella handed me a brand new barbie with pigtails. 

“Do you want to swap? I can give you Charlie, but you need to give *me* a head.”

It was a pretty fair deal, considering the barbie she gave me was one of the expensive ones. 

She was a fully detachable doll. 

I agreed, and with my mother’s consent 

(I didn't even ask, she was at the sheriff station joining the search party for Jem). 

But her mother believed my lie, and happily let me jump into her car with Ella. 

This girl and her family were rich. 

Like, RICH rich. 

Her house was a mansion. 

Once we stepped through the door, dolls were *everywhere*, spilled across posh flooring and dumped all over the furniture. 

Ella grabbed my hand and led me to the “special” dolls in her dad’s basement, where her headless barbie was. 

Walking down cement steps, I remember the temperature dropping significantly. 

Ella’s basement was dark. 

But then she turned on the light, and I looked for dolls. 

Ella told me she had fucking dolls, and that's what I was looking for. 

Except there *were* dolls. 

Big dolls. 

Human sized. 

Four large dolls hung by their legs, their heads severed from their bodies. 

There were three guys, and a girl-- and it didn't take me long to understand *what* I was looking at. 

But I couldn't stop fucking staring, and this image is stuck in my head. 

I can't get it out. 

I will NEVER get it out of my head. 

Across the room from the bodies, four heads sat on a wooden shelf. 

I remember the one with a pretty ponytail, makeup perfectly painting her face. 

Her eyes were still wide open, lips forcibly stretched into a grin, glitter on her cheeks. 

Clee. 

I skipped over the other two, my gaze finding the last one. 

Closed eyes, lips pressed into a peaceful smile. 

His hair had been savagely cut, and it looked so *wrong*.. 

Jem would never let his hair get so messy. 

I started forwards, trembling, whispering, my brother’s name. 

The worst part is, I don't remember any blood.

The bodies were perfect, just like dolls, glistening under flickering yellow light. 

I remember not being able to fucking breathe. But Ella was grabbing, and dragging me back, laughing. 

“Oh, I almost forgot!” her voice, her words, are still in my head. 

They fucking haunt me. 

Ella pointed to the fourth headless body hanging from the hook. 

It wore fresh jeans, a t-shirt, and cowboy boots, its skin shining, perfectly embalmed. 

“I don't need a Barbie head!” she said excitedly. “I actually need a *”Ken.”*

Luckily, the cops were already swarming Ella’s house before I could become another victim. 

In the days following, I stopped playing with dolls. I dumped my dreamhouse in the trash. I trashed every single doll. 

I attended my brother’s funeral, but I could never think about him the same. 

Ella’s parents went to jail, but it was very clear to me that their daughter was at least part of it. 

She insisted it was *all* her parents, but they were *her* so-called dolls. 

I don't know much about what happened to her. 

She was adopted by a family who moved out of state. 

I think she's changed her name. 

I know the case is very local, and nobody speaks of it because they don't *want* to.  

Mom insisted on therapy, and it helped, but not much. 

I still couldn't get that image out of my head. 

I'm 22 now. I have my own apartment. 

Mom and I barely speak, and I think it's because of Jem. 

She's getting better, but sometimes she has these outbursts and calls me, begging me to come and see her. 

I do. Every time. 

Today, I arrived back at my childhood home. It's been a few months, and the place is a mess, so I started to clean up. 

Mom was out shopping, so after cleaning the downstairs, I moved to the upstairs bathroom, and the room I was dreading. 

Jem’s room. 

It was exactly how he'd left it. 

Still filled with scripts and unfinished stories. 

Even the bed was un-made, which I thought was weird. 

I could have sworn it was made last time. 

Moving to my room, I shoved the door open and hauled in the vacuum cleaner. 

But then I saw what was on my bed. 

I thought I was seeing things. 

But no. 

Jem. 

Eighteen year old Jem, who died when I was nine years old, sitting cross-legged on my sheets. 

Positioned like a doll, his hands were in his lap. His hair had been combed, and he had a full face of make-up. 

On the floor, sitting around my Barbie dreamhouse I trashed eight years ago, were Clee, Wylan, and Reece. 

All of them mid-playing with my dolls. 

Clee was frozen holding Cindy, brushing her red hair. 

Wylan and Reece were each holding their dolls in the air.

Their skin was waxy and wrong, and doll-like. 

Like melted plastic. 

I stumbled out of my room, took several deep breaths, and squeezed my eyes shut. 

I counted to fifty. Slowly. I felt like I was suffocating. 

But when I forced myself back inside, they were still there. 

Their expressions had dramatically changed. 

Clee was now rolling her eyes. Recce was grinning. 

Wylan was frozen, gesturing for me to, “Come here!”

And my brother’s head had snapped around, his eyes glued to me. 

Grinning. 

Just to make sure I'm not losing my fucking mind, I waited for my mother to come home. 

Instead of freaking out, she smiled, and said, “Well? Aren't you going to play with them?”

… 

Please help me. I can't stand these things being in my house. 

They're moving, but I don't know why and I don't know how *why*. 

The last time I dared peek through my bedroom door, Jem’s smile was only growing bigger and bigger. 

It's stretching right across his face. 

What the fuck is this?
