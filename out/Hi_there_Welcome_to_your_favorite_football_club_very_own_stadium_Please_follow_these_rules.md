For context, I’m a manager here working in this stadium so yes, my words are truly safe. I have worked here since 2017 and would recommended you to follow these rules. These rules are written on a piece of paper that I handed to you before you sit down at your seat, please read them during or before match if you forgot a rule or two. This is for your own safety.

1) If any circumstances your favorite club is playing against their rival but the time they stated the match will take around is 7-8 PM, DO NOT. And I repeat. DO NOT GO TO THE MATCH ON ANY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES. If you did buy the ticket, follow rule 1A.

1A) Please pray to the god you believe him because even I can’t stop this now. You have bought the ticket which mean you HAVE to go.
God bless your soul. 

2) When entering the stadium, a security guard will come and check your baggage if you have one. No matter how suspicious they look please for the love of god follow them. Your ending shall not be merciful if you do not. There are many “suspicious” looking security guards but there are also fakes out there, if you accidentally gave your baggage to the fake security guard, I’m so so sorry. You may only realize this after you sit down at your seat but oh god, I’m deeply sorry. But I’ll tell you the appearance of the real security guards.

2A) Their size is huge. Giant like-almost. But they will wear a cap all time. If you remember that your security guard looked like this then you’re safe.

2B) Their height is small, smaller than average men. They are like 5’6. They will have blonde hair, sometimes they can be brown, black or ginger red but never any other colors. If your security guard appearance is like this then you’re safe.
(If they don’t fall on any of these category, I’m deeply and very sorry but instead of you having a horrific end, your loved ones will instead, every single one of them. I’m deeply and so so sorry again. May god bless their souls.)

3) When the match is going on, there will be some “strange” looking people beside you just watching. If they try to talk to you, it’s best to completely ignore them unless they asked about a footballer, if you don’t reply to them about this, I’m sorry. However you can escape this by making a bet with them and try predicting the score or a goal, if you failed to do so, oh god. I’m sorry. Your end will be more horrific than before.

4) If the stadium is awfully quiet and not loud like usual, please refer to 4A.

4A) Immediately get down below your seat and lay down there while covering your heads, and DO NOT. Any circumstances look up until the commentator says “GOAALLL!!” But watch out, the commentator sometimes will trick you so look out for the crowd cheer noise for your own safety.

5) If the scorer comes up and celebrating and then proceeds to look at you, DO NOT look unhappy or any other emotions. Be happy for them. Failure to do so will get you an personal “invitation” to their dressing room. And you ABSOLUTELY do not wanna go in there. Your end will be horrific.

6) Under any circumstances should you go on a match that is on wednesday or tuesday. The fans will be aggressive especially on these days. We do not know the reason why they are aggressive on these specific days but it’s best advised for you to not go there.

7) I advise for you to only eat food that the owner said had a “green sticker” on them, you may not see it but the owner can. You can ask to them about this. They will not lie. They are very prideful about their food safety. And I also advise for you to not drink any alcohol or any substances that might make you a bit chaotic during match because many fans have done this and caused disturbance during match for others. If you do the same then our security team will have to take you away and “take care” of you personally. No, anyone didn’t tell the security. The security just know.

8) You may use your phone during the match to record a moment of anything special or anything else but you CAN’T NOT record the entire match. And no, you can’t take photos. Only the crew down there right beside the pitch can. Our security team will know if you’re recording the entire match. Let’s just say they have exceptional sense.

9) If you’re sitting beside a team dressing room and wanna go for a handshake or an autograph, etc, follow these additional rules.

9A) Please be a VIP or a really devoted fan. Our security will know if you’re a devoted fan or not. 

9B) If the footballer hand looks a bit off, even the tiniest bit like extra fingers, random hole on their hand, DO NOT shake it. After you leave the stadium, a horrific end will occur to you if you did shake them.

9C) If you got an autograph and there’s a red dot somewhere on the paper/merch/etc. that they wrote it on, DISPOSE OF IT NOW. I don’t really care if you don’t wanna do it or not but for your own safety and your loved ones, please for the love of god, DISPOSE OF IT. The dot will be quite large so you can easily notice it.

10) If you wanna go to the bathroom or just leave for a certain moment, leave something important for you at your seat. The others will know it’s your seat and won’t sit on them. Don’t worry, in our stadium, the fans never steal.

11) A middle aged white man who is fairly fat will come sit right beside you to your right. Agree to EVERYTHING he says. Unless it’s anything bad about your football club, then you can defend them. He’ll understand and won’t talk bad about them again.

12) If for any reasons you noticed something is off about the footballer’s face or body, please do not look at them for the rest of the match, yes you can still see him when you’re viewing the match itself but don’t look at him intentionally again for the rest of the match. Don’t worry, they will be noticeable from any far range so you don’t have to worry. And if they’re celebrating and looks at you like rule 5, follow 12A.

12A) Simply close your eyes and just cheer and look happy like how other fans do. You got 15 seconds to do this after you realized the footballer is looking at you. If you didn’t do it in time, pray to the god you believe in. Your end will not be merciful.

Thank you for coming to our stadium, we hope you had a good time in here while watching the match. Please follow these rules again if you wanna come back, that’s all!
