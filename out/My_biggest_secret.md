When I was 15, less than a week before my 16th birthday, I had a spontaneous conversation with my friend. I asked him what he wanted to do when he grew up, and he dropped a bomb on me. "I want to leave society. I want to go live in nature, like our ancestors." It didn’t surprise me all that much because he was always the type who didn’t care about school, loved physical work, and hated modern society, capitalism, and especially money. He explained to me, why should we work hard at jobs we don’t like just to buy things we do? Why not work in ways we enjoy to get what we want as a result? He wanted to buy just a few seeds and "disappear" from Earth. I agreed with him, and I even wanted to join him, but unlike him, I was doing well in school, and I had a promising future ahead of me. But in the end, I fell for it. I went with him. I even managed to convince him that if we didn’t take just a few essentials with us, we’d die within a week. So we made a list of things to take, and one of the items was a revolver with only 6 bullets. We didn’t take any more. We agreed not to tell anyone because it would ruin everything.

The two of us planned for years throughout high school, working on physical labor to train ourselves, learning how to live in nature and how to camp. In the meantime, we had to work hard as well, since we wanted to find the perfect place on our own through our travels. After high school, we both joined the military for three years, where we trained ourselves well and made money in the process. After finishing our service, we rented an apartment together and spent six months saving up as much as we could. One night, we realized we had saved enough, and we decided: tonight is the night "we die."

You’re probably asking what I mean by "die." Well, we decided to fake our deaths in a drunk-driving accident. We would buy fake identities and vanish from the face of the Earth. Why? To avoid taxes. We didn’t want to pay taxes for moving between countries or for being labeled tourists (but mostly because we wanted to erase every trace of our existence). So we set things in motion. I drove, and my friend placed empty vodka bottles on the back seat. I swerved off the road and hit a pole in such a way that we wouldn’t be physically injured. We got out of the car and pushed it into a nearby lake. From that moment, we understood that our lives as we knew them were over. We wanted no ties to the outside world from that moment on. The closest thing we had were a radio, an MP3 player, a solar charger, and a Nokia phone. We walked the entire way from the United States to Brazil (it took a while) and eventually found the perfect spot: a river (for fishing), a nearby forest, and the area wasn’t owned by the government. We built our base there ourselves and lived there for almost 16 years, alone, with almost no connection to the outside world. 

One morning, I woke up—it was my turn to patrol the area around the base (by that time, we had built a huge agricultural area and a large living space). When I returned, I saw a wild cat near our house. I pulled out the revolver—there were only 4 bullets left (we had used one on a bear and one had accidentally gone off 7 years earlier)—and I fired once at the wild cat. It killed it instantly. I ran over and saw my best friend sitting there, bleeding to death. Luckily, I had studied medicine for four years, so I knew how to treat such wounds and managed to stop most of the bleeding, but not without my friend being in tremendous pain. He knew he wouldn’t be able to withstand the pain, so he begged me to shoot him, to end his suffering. "No one will ever know," he said. "To the world, we’re already dead" (shortly after we disappeared, we heard that the news reported our "deaths," but since no bodies were found, we had been officially declared dead without remains), "and practically no one knows about our fake identities. Just do it. End my pain. Put an end to this!"

I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t want to shoot my friend, but I didn’t want him to suffer either. At some point, he gave me a small smile and took off the necklace he had around his neck—one we had bought for each other before the journey, one for me and one for him. He told me that once it was all over, I should read the note inside. There didn’t appear to be a hidden compartment in the necklace, so I didn’t understand at first. In the end, I did it. I shot my friend. He smiled at me one last time before he died. I sat there for days, crying over him—my best friend who I had lived with for nearly 16 years. I remembered that when I was almost 16, he had told me about this. I realized immediately that this wasn’t a coincidence, and because of that, I knew I shouldn’t grieve for him. I buried him, made a makeshift gravestone, and placed flowers on it. That’s when I realized I couldn’t stay there. I had to leave this place behind. 

We had stashed $400,000 in cash in a drawer in case of emergencies. I took as much food and water as I could carry, left our home, and began my journey. I walked for about two weeks before I reached an area with people. I spoke Portuguese, so I went to a taxi stand and ordered a taxi to the nearest airport. I bought the earliest flight back to the U.S. Within 24 hours, I was standing at my parents’ front door. I knew I couldn’t tell them who I was—I’d go to prison—but I couldn’t keep it all to myself either. Just as I was about to turn and leave, my mom opened the door. She saw me standing there, confused, as though I’d landed in a new world. At first, she didn’t recognize me, or at least I think she didn’t. She asked if I needed help with something, and I quickly said no. Then I saw an old dog coming out of their house. That dog was a one-week-old puppy my parents had adopted the day I "died." I held back my tears, turned around, and left. 

I sat on a bench for about two hours straight, thinking about what to do next. I saw a house for sale right across the street from my parents’ home. It was being sold for almost exactly the amount of money I had, leaving me with just a little extra. The house was slightly rundown, but I bought it that day. That’s where I’ve lived for the past 20 years. I found a wife, married her, and today I have three beautiful children. No one knows about my previous identity, not even my family. Last week, I found four large notebooks in my closet. In them, my friend and I had written down what happened to us every day from day one. We hadn’t missed a single day. That’s when I knew I had to go back—just for one last visit.

I flew to Brazil and returned to that house. It was still there, though nature had started to reclaim it. I made a makeshift chair in about 15 minutes and just sat there, next to my friend, drinking vodka like the bottles we had stashed in the car back then. I slept in the bed I had slept in 20 years earlier. Still comfortable. In the morning, I placed a special rose I had bought for the occasion on my friend’s grave. Only at that moment, standing there in front of the grave for the last time, did I finally have the courage to read what was inside the necklace. I took a large rock and smashed the necklace easily. Inside was a small note my friend had written long ago. He had written things that touched my heart—things and private jokes that only he and I understood. No one made me laugh the way he did. At the end of the note, it was as if he was standing right next to me, watching what I was doing now. He knew I’d leave, and he knew I’d only return when I was ready to face this place again. I burst into tears. I also knew what I needed to do. 

I took a lighter and burned the house down to its foundation. I made sure no trees caught fire in the process (after 16 years of living there, we had already cut down most of the surrounding trees, so it wasn’t too hard). The only thing left there was my friend’s grave. I didn’t want to touch it. Luckily, the grave was located right next to the river. I took my revolver and threw it into the river, watching as it floated away. From there, I returned home and waved a final goodbye to my friend. 

I returned to the U.S. about 12 hours ago, and I knew I had to share this story somewhere. So here it is.

Thank you for reading until the end
