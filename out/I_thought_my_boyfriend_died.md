TRIGGER WARNING: This story contains drug use and blood. 
Some may say it isn't really a scary story but for me it was terrifying and traumatizing. Also I'm sorry it's so long but it all is important for the story. 

  Me and my boyfriend had been together for about 2 years when this happened. We like to smoke and sometimes we would take other stuff. I'll call my boyfriend C, he and I liked to take drugs that made you hyperactive and just play games for several days. We could be awake for a week sometimes and everytime we went out for walks, we would see stuff that wasn't there. 

  We thought it was really cool, if you're experienced with lsd this is nothing (or so we thought). The problem is when you stay awake for so long and snort chemicals on an empty stomach you can start to hallucinate and also get into a psychosis.  

  We had been awake for a week and we had decided to finally sleep, we would probably wake up in like 20 hours. We ate and smoked a cigarette through his window before going to bed. It was summer and it was very hot, my boyfriend can't take the heat so he always has to sleep with an open window. 

  I had a strange feeling in the middle of the night at about 3 AM and when I opened my eyes, I saw him stepping out of the window. Completely silent just walking out like he was walking up some stairs. How it looked and felt was so eerie, he was completely silent.

  I looked down and saw him laying on the ground, I screamed but I couldn't hear anything, it's like I wasn't there like nothing was real. I ran through his apartment and just grabbed whatever I could find since I was wearing his boxers and nothing else (Yes I'm a girl and was wearing boxers lol). 

  That's when I noticed that his bathroom door had been taken off and was resting against the wall, we still have no idea why but he often talked and walked in his sleep. 

  I don't remember how but suddenly I was by him, he was lying there in his boxers I was starting to dissociate or something cause I felt like it was dangerous for me to stay (I've later figured out it was the chock). I saw a pool of blood around his head and I thought he was dead, he clearly hit his head when he fell two stories down. He was unconscious but I later found out that after I left he apparently got up, stumbled around and was talking gibberish to the staff, like he was sleep talking but his eyes were open.

  I banged on the window for the night staff (I don't know what it's called in english but he got help from the state with a support-apartment before he could show them he was ready to have his own) the staff didn't even react at first and then it all was a blur and I felt like if I stay here something bad will happen, suddenly I'm running on the road I cross every day and I have no idea where I am. 

  In my head, my older sister(I don't have one) wanted to kill me so I just ran for my life, I saw a taxi and ran in the middle of the street to get their attention, they didn't stop so I started running towards the parking lot and that's when I saw a creepy man stare at me while walking towards me so I bolted to the nearest houses. In my head it was like in those movies when they're banging on doors while being chased by the killer while no one opens. I have never been this terrified in my life. 

  In my head I'm a 10 year old named Sara (I was actually 19 and my name was not Sara) I had forgotten completely what I was running from and I guess my brain fabricated a story to protect me from the trauma of C falling out the window. I banged on many doors and finally someone opened, they let me in and I told them I'm Sara, I'm 10 and someone is after me. They looked at me weird but I just got in and sat on their couch. 

  I then asked them to call the ambulance (Why not police? Cause I don't trust them) and the ambulance felt like they were never coming so I started thinking the family never called them and that they were trying to kidnap me so I just sat there in my bf's minion boxers, his slippers and his winter jacket thinking I'm a child while planning my escape. 

I was so relieved when the ambulance finally showed up, when I sat in the ambulance they started asking questions and I started realizing stuff. I looked down at my necklace that I got from him and broke down as all the memories came back. What's crazy was that I thought he was dead and no one told me the opposite until hours later. 

  I layed empty at my bed a whole day before I got to see him but then as soon as we got to meet, the police called me cause they needed to interrogate me. He didn't remember anything, he just went to bed and woke up in the hospital. I was the only one who saw him go out the window so it made sense but they could have asked me earlier when he was in the hospital... I was crying on the way to the station, he means everyting to me and they just forced me away. 

We found out later that he got saved because a staff was lazy that night. He parked the bus close to the door so he wouldn't have to walk a few extra steps. When C fell he landed on the car, broke the windshield and left a dent before bouncing down to the ground. If the staff wouldn't be lazy, he wouldn't be here today. 

  He had to get 6 stitches on his eyebrow, had 4 fractures, air in his skull and wounds like everywhere. He can still feel the pain every time I pluck his eyebrows. Sometimes feel so bad for leaving him but I know I can't help that my brain chose to run while in chock. Now more than 2 years later, I'm still traumatized.
