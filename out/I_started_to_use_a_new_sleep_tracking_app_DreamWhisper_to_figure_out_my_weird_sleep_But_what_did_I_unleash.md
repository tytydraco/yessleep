My name is Alex. I recently started using this new sleep tracking app called 'DreamWhisper.' It's supposed to track your sleep, record sounds, and stuff. I thought it'd be cool to figure out why I sleep so weirdly.

But things got really strange after a bit. I played back this recording, right? Among all the tossing and turning, I hear this whisper. It's faint, but it's there, saying 'I'm free.' Freaked me out, not gonna lie. My heart started racing, and I even checked under my bed to see if anyone's hiding there, out of  the old habit when I was a kid.

Then, I start finding these weird pictures on my phone. Pictures I don't remember taking. They're all dark, but there's something in them. Some figure, just barely there, in my room while I'm sleeping. I couldn't believe my eyes, and a shiver ran down my spine. Were they taken by the app while I was asleep? Or, was ‘it’ taking a cute little selfie by itself? I can’t continue my thought without goosebumps running from head to toe.

The unsettling feeling grew stronger as I delved into it. It gnawed at my mind, a constant source of worry and anxiety. I hit the net, looking for answers. Turns out, I'm not the only one. The DreamWhisper forums are full of people hearing and seeing weird stuff. We're all freaking out, sharing our experiences, and trying to piece together this unsettling puzzle.

As I kept looking at these photos, they felt increasingly familiar, like they were dredged up from deep down. They were kinda ghostly, blurry, but definitely human-shaped. One of them really gets to me – tall, all twisted and weird. I just couldn't shake off the eerie sense of familiarity with it, as if I'd seen it during my childhood. My mind raced through memories, trying to connect the dots. Was it from a childhood TV show? Or from an old scary storybook? Where on earth did I see it before?

And then it suddenly clicked – these figures, they were from my nightmares! Growing up, I'd been plagued by the same recurring nightmare over and over again. But every morning when I woke up, all I could recall was this vague feeling of weirdness. Like some people couldn't remember the details of their dreams. However, this app had somehow materialized the dormant memories for me. Not only that, it seemed to be pulling my worst nightmares into the real world. Those terrifying creatures from my darkest dreams, they were out there now, roaming around at night, like twisted echoes of my subconscious fears made real.

Of course, they shut the app down. And claimed that the ‘stuff’ people saw were just hallucinations from a glitching wavelength sent out by the app. But that feeling, like something's still lurking around? Can't shake it off. Some nights, I catch glimpses in the dark, hear those whispers. Makes me wonder what we've unleashed.

Ok wrapping it up so I can catch up on some sleep. Finger crossed I'm finally able to, without seeing the 'stuff' tonight. I'll keep that light on. Cause you never know what's hiding in the dark.
