Hello! I was hoping to get some answers from this community. To see if anyone has shared this experience with a loved one or family member. I don’t know where else to ask this so I’m hoping someone can share more info on this. 

I’ve witnessed a lot of paranormal activity ever since I was a kid. However, one thing that has stuck in my memory is these three men dressed in black. They’re dressed in a black trench coat with black hats and black shinny shoes. Their face is indescribable. It just seems to be like a foggy version of what you could describe as a face. That’s the closest I can get to describing them. I have seen them in dreams and I had seen them in my house growing up, typically a couple of months (or weeks) before a family member would pass away. Here is the kicker though, my family members on my dad’s side who were on their deathbeads, would describe these three men dressed in black and they’d typically be ridiculed by the rest of the family. It’s bonkers to me that no one ever seems to acknowledge the pattern in my family. Had it been one person describing them on their death bead that’d be one thing… but all of them?

Anyway, the two worst times I heard it was when my paternal grandparents passed away just a couple of years apart from each other. The absolute pain those words brought on… I still remember the day we were in my grandparent’s house and my grandpa had miraculously survived his second open-heart surgery. After a couple of weeks of being on bed rest, he mentioned the three men dressed im black who would stand in front of the house at night. Everyone made fun of him, as is custom, but I, of course, panicked because I knew what this meant. However, this was also the first time it had been such a close death. So this was the first time I got to witness the progression descriptions from my grandpa. Because while these men dressed in black would stand in front of the house at first, they then progressed to standing in the living room, then the family room, until he would describe them standing around him in his bedroom to watch him sleep. He mentioned one would sit by his feet and stare at him. As they got closer, his health worsted. This went on for about 6-8 months until he also started to see his sister who would apparently taunt him, telling him he was about to die. It got so bad that he wouldn’t sleep at night and started sleeping during the day. Until he, shortly after, passed away.

A couple of years went by, and my brother calls me and tells me about grandma’s men dressed in black. Again, seemingly completely unworried about the whole thing. I even asked him if he hadn’t noticed how grandpa saw those same men a couple of years prior and it just seemed like the patter was lost on him. Which made me feel like I was losing my mind so I just let it go. I cried so much because I already knew what was coming. My grandma started to see the three men dressed in black. She said they would try to get in at night. In her panic she would throw them money thinking they were thieves who just wanted to steal from her. Then they would get into her living room… and about 6-8 months later… she passed.

Like I mentioned earlier, when I was a kid I remember seeing these men in my living room. Typically a couple of months before someone passed. I haven’t gotten a visit from them since I moved out of my country, but I still remember them and other figures from my childhood vividly. The last time I saw them I was 19, but I had noticed them as early as 6.

So… my reason for this post isn’t really to scare anyone or get any sort of reaction. I’m more so hopeful that someone on here knows more about these men. Maybe someone with a shared experience or a better understanding of the paranormal that might be able to provide me some answers. I haven’t seen them in a while, but I’m scared of what it would mean if I did.

Also, a little background on my dad’s family, there had been a lot of rumors of deals being made and sacrifices offered to deities or spirits for personal gains.
