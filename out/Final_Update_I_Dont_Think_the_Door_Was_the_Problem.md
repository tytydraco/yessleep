I finally did it. I packed my bag, left the apartment, and told myself that was enough. I told myself that distance would fix whatever was happening between Jenna and I. I repeated this mantra over and over again, the entire drive to my friend’s place, like saying it might make it true. After what happened last night, though, I don’t think moving out is the solution I hoped it would be.

I keep trying to remember when I actually fell asleep, and I can’t. There’s no clear break in my memory, just a blur, like someone smeared the edges of the evening and morning together.

I didn’t wake up to footsteps or breathing this time.

I dreamed.

In the dream, I was standing in the hallway outside my bedroom, facing my own open doorway. My legs felt tired in a way they never do in dreams, heavy and sore, like I’d already been standing there for a long time.

The lock was gone. The chair and bin were gone. It was like my efforts to barricade my door never existed. I realized from somewhere beyond the threshold of my open door I could hear breathing. My breathing, slightly delayed, like it didn’t quite belong to me anymore.

Behind me, someone said my name.

I turned and saw Jenna.

She looked wrong. Not monstrous, not possessed, just… exhausted. She was pale. Her eyes were ringed dark, wide and glossy like she hadn’t slept in days. She looked scared, not angry, not confused, but scared in a way that felt urgent. She told me I wasn’t supposed to be out here. That it wasn’t time yet. That I needed to go back. Her voice shook, like she was trying very hard not to raise it.

I tried to push past her.

That’s when it turned physical.

She grabbed my arm. I shoved her. We collided into the wall, hard enough to knock the air out of me. I remember thinking, even in the dream, how strong she felt, how desperate she was. I remember screaming at her to let me go. To get out of my way. She was shouting something too, but I couldn’t quite hear it, like she was trying to talk over rushing water or through a thick barrier.

I woke up.

I was on my bedroom floor.

My door was open.

My arm ached. When I looked down, there were deep, finger-shaped bruises blooming around my wrist. My shoulder throbbed. My throat felt raw, like I’d been yelling for a long time.

I staggered into the kitchen.

Jenna was already there.

She looked at me and immediately burst into tears. The kind that hit all at once, like she’d been holding them back for too long.

She had the same bruises.

Same wrist. Same shape. Same color.

She said she dreamed we were fighting. That she woke up standing in the hallway with her hands raised like she’d been pushing against something heavy. She asked me, very quietly, what I’d been doing before I went to sleep.

I didn’t know how to answer.

We haven’t spoken much since. I’m staying with a friend now. Jenna didn’t try to stop me. Before I walked out, she said, “If you start waking up outside your room again, don’t come back here.”

I asked her what she meant.

She just shook her head and said, “I can’t keep doing this.” She didn’t sound angry. She sounded tired.

I keep telling myself that leaving was the right choice.

I’m writing this from my friend’s couch. I haven’t slept yet. I don’t know if I will. The apartment is quiet, unfamiliar, and somehow that makes it worse. Every small sound feels like it’s waiting for something else to follow it.

I’ve been killing time on my phone, deleting apps I don’t use, when I noticed a step counter I don’t remember downloading.

Last night, between 2:47 and 3:12 a.m., it logged over a thousand steps.

I can’t remember leaving the room.

I don’t know where I went.

And there’s no one standing in front of the door to stop me now.
