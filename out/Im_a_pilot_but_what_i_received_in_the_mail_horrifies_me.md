I’m typing this in my bathroom, with nowhere else to run, just waiting for death. Below is my background and what got me into this unworldly mess. I’m a pilot who was working for singapore airlines and have been loving my job for the past 40 years or so until that god forsaken letter showed up. Now all my social media account was suddenly banned and no matter what I did, I could not open a new one, yet somehow my reddit account is still active. I just hope that whoever read this could help me escape that thing. What came in the mail was a transcript of SQ221, a flight I flew just 2 weeks ago and a letter… I don’t know who sent this but the contents is horrifying. I’ll type it in here for you. Here’s what the recording said followed by the letter:

[START OF BLACKBOX RECORDING]

Air Traffic Controller (ATC): Singapore 221, line up and wait 02 Left

Me: Line up and wait 02 left, Singapore 221

***5 minutes pass***

ATC: Singapore 221, Cleared for takeoff, Runway 02 Left, Winds 130@05

Me: Clear for takeoff Runway 02 left, Singapore 221

***Engines Roaring***

Me: Thrust set

F/O: Checked

Me: Cancel takeoff clearance, taxi to holding point Bravo 2

Me: Reversers Green

***Aircraft Thrust Reversers can be heard***

***Recording Stopped***

The letter:

“Captain, I’m impressed. You somehow avoided death itself. Flight 221 was never meant to land at zurich. Don’t worry, everyone else onboard is dead/captured. We made sure that you were the last. After all, you have flown with us over 40 years, so we decided to give you the best. Oh and don’t bother looking at news or manifest. Basically everything about that flight has been covered. As far as the world knows, Flight 221 never took off, it was grounded at the airport. Have fun surviving”

It simply impossible, I flew the aircraft myself. How could I land in zurich if we never took off, I was confused and horrified, how the hell did someone get ahold of the planes blackbox. 

Then it hit me, John. a few years back me and this guy I’ll call john, had horns locked together. Constantly fighting, at that time, I didn’t know he was the largest shareholder of the airline. I tried to end the bickering and thought all was well until he started acting weird. He would constantly be the engineer to clear my plane for flying. I didn’t want to believe the letter, I didn’t want to believe it was John. A little background on John, He’s our engineer in charge and is basically one of the tycoon son within the airline. What i know for a fact is that we landed in Zurich on time.

I searched on flightradar24, all i got was the confirmation that the letter was real. Flight 221 never left the airport, no investigation nothing, but I believe the airline has bribed the authorities a very handsome sum of money to stop the investigation. By default, all cancelled flight has to go through a small investigation to determine if there was any mechanical errors with the plane or malpractice and it would be published publicly, but somehow, my flight was the exception. No investigation, no interview, hell not even the news crew were there. 

To everyone else, it was just another canceled flight that never flew and just assumed that an investigation was ongoing and would be published soon. Part of me believed that it’s probably just a hoax, that some prankster has somehow gotten my address and hacked into every single one of my devices. Still refusing the believe the letter or the recording, I decided to pay a visit to my first officer, hoping that he is still alive. Then, my phone rang. It was my first officer for that very flight. I picked it up and answered:

“hello?”

“…”

I thought he had called me by accident but then a shrieking noise came from the phone, it sounded like my first officer. Something really bad was happening there, then, i heard him say:
“That recording is cursed, whatever you do, DO NOT PLAY IT. THAT THING WILL KI-”**Blood splatters can be heard as if whatever killed him just squeezed a watermelon hard enough for it to burst**

then the line cuts off…

I was horrified, I had already played the audio more than i could count over the past few days and everyday, i could feel as if, someone or something was getting closer. The first few days was not so bad. More like a mild annoyance. It was like hearing some branch drop on your roof, then it started to become worse and worse. Knocking on the windows, Car alarm going off at random time, even my stove turned on by its own. I’ve always assumed it was my own forgetfulness or some jokers playing a prank on me but what happened 2 days ago has confirmed to me that it wasn’t.

2 Days ago, i heard a knock on my door, I had just came back from a drive to clear my head and was tired. I was walking towards the door when i heard a very familiar voice… my first officer. He was knocking on my door. I stood frozen, I had heard his head get squished like it was a ballon and somehow, he was alive. I found the courage after awhile to get my phone to check my front door camera while the knocking continued. When i open the app, I was horrified. My first officer was in his uniform, but his head was just…. gone. Blood was spewing everywhere around my front door. I ran as fast as i could grabbing thing like my wallet and phone and a kitchen knife while running towards the back door.

I managed to find a nice hotel which frankly calmed my nerves abit and decided to go for a quick shower, locking the door behind me. 

As i turned on the shower, I stand frozen in place with nowhere to run. Because whatever i do next, I will be dead no matter what. I heard a knock on my bathroom door, my first officer calling out my name.

I just hope someone could save me in time… and i’m pretty sure i just heard my door unlock…
