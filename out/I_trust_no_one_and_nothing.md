I made myself ready to sleep. I checked if my rabbit was okey and went to bed. Today was a very tiring day. So I immediately fell asleep. But only two hours later I woke up again. There was this noise. It was weird. It sounded like some sort of clicking. I thought it was my father who was working on his computer or some mice that were running on the roof again so I ignored it and went back to sleep. That night I had a weird dream. I was in my house but there was dust everywhere. And the house, it was so dark. I am not scared of the dark but the absence of light that was in my dream was truly terrifying. It felt like there was a pressure in the air and that I never would be happy again. I was slowly walking around the house full with scratches over my body. And there I saw something. In the corner. The corner was completely dark but I saw red eyes coming out of it. The last thing I remember is a terrible sound. It was a mixture of a low screech and that clicking sound again. 

I woke up with a huge scratch on my cheek. I wasn't that surprised of it because it wasn't the first time that I scratched myself in my sleep. I decided to start my day.

After I ate my breakfast and took a shower I checked on my rabbit. There was a little dried up blood on his paw. I thought he probably had a small cut on his paw so I decided to wash his paw. After cleaning him up I on the rocking chair in the livingroom and scrolled on my phone a bit. 

My father came downstairs and asked about the clicking in the night. I told him that I thought that it was him and he looked at me with a confused face. It can't be someone else considering I don't have siblings nor a mother. But we both concluded that it was indeed the mice on the roof again.

Later that day my father went to work for the weekend and I decided to wash the dishes until I heard that weird clicking again. It stopped soon and I went on with my day. In the evening it started again. It started annoying me so I went upstairs to see if I could do something about it. But it didn't come from the roof. So I followed the sound and ended up in my room. I looked around but I was distracted. My rabbit wasn't in his cage.Â  I turned around looking for him. But when I looked at the doorway I saw him. I let out a sight. I calmed down until the clicking started again. But now it was all twisted and slowed down. My heart skipped a beat when I realized that it came from my rabbit. I didn't know what was going on so I just stood there. This sounds weird and stupid but he scared me. A crippling fear came over me when he started to turn into something terrible. His legs became unbelievable long. The body stretched out in an unnatural proportion. And than his mouth. It opened until it was a meter long wide with incredible long and sharp teeth. And there it was again. The sound from my dream. But this time it was so loud that I had to cover my ears, trying to protect my ears. I was trapped in the room. It stood between me and the door ans before I could think he sprinted towards me. I quickly looked around and found a lamp. I took it and smashed it against his head but it did nothing. I jumped out of the window and landed on my ankle. The pain was immense because I was on the third floor. but I didn't waste time and started running again. 

I wanted to run towards my friend's house but if I do that I'd bring her in danger as well. So I ran trough the streets but he blocked the way the only other way was towards the woods. So I ran there and climbed in a tree. I don't know where to go nor where it is. So that's why I share this. Not because I want help. This is just a warning. You can't trust anyone, no human, no pet. If there is no update. I am probably dead...or worse.
