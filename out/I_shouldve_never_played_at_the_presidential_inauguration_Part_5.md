Sorry for the long wait, we spent some time in Virginia to rest and plan our next move. But we do know we have to leave soon, so heres a recap on what happened: 

When we got to Virginia, we checked into a hotel, and it was amazing being able to sleep in an actual bed instead of on some leaves in a tent.  But we were then hungry, we hadn’t eaten anything since leaving North Dakota, and our food we already had long spoiled. So we searched where the best restaurant near us was, and it was located in a sketchy alleyway, but we were all hungry anyway, so we left our hotel room and went down the alleyway. 

But down the alley, I saw two glowing eyes, but those weren’t red, but instead green. But we ignored it and entered the restaurant. It was quite petite, with a small retro like dining area, with the menu on a window. So we read it.

But everything said “mystery item” but we were very hungry and didn’t want to spend more time looking for another restaurant. So we went to the counter to pay but we then saw the food, in a take out bag with a jar for us to pay. We could’ve just stolen the food as there was no cameras, but we didn’t want to break the law so we grabbed the bag and left our cash on the counter. We then started walking back to our hotel room.

When we arrived at our hotel, I opened the bag and opened one of the take out boxes.  It just seemed like fish and chips, so I grabbed a fry and ate it, but it was very chewy, like skin. I thought it was just a bad fry so I grabbed another one and ate it, it was chewy, too. Meanwhile, Ernest grabbed a piece of the fish and ate it, before immediately spitting it out. 

He said to us it tasted like pork, with the fried part tasting like skin, too. I figured the food just went bad, so I went to the trash bin to throw it, but a slip of paper on the top caught my eye, so I grabbed it to read what it said.

“The Ethan” the paper said.

Then it started coming to me, I remembered cannibals saying that human flesh tasted like pork, the fish tasted like pork. As well as the fries being chewy, like skin. We were eating our friend, Ethan, all this time. I felt like I needed to vomit, but I fought back feeling of nausea and grabbed the drink that the restaurant provided to us. It looked red, like fruit punch. So I started to drink it, but instead of the sweetness of artificial fruit, it tasted like blood. I read the label the container said.

“Ethan’s blood”

I couldn’t hold it back anymore, I ran to the toilet to empty out the contents of my stomach. I no longer felt hungry, considering we just consumed our friend, Ethan. “How could this be five stars?” I thought to myself. Then our door knocked.

I, shaking in fear, grabbed the doorknob to open it, but I realized I should look through the peephole first, so I did. But no one was there, so I opened it anyway.

It was a note.

I picked it up an read it:

“Thank you for buying from our restaurant, we hoped you loved our speciality, Ethan’s”

I ripped the paper in half and threw it in the trash.

“Should we leave?” I asked Aiden and Ernest. But they said no and we should check into another hotel

But I was so tired I didn’t want to spend the hassle finding a new one, so I decided to stay back while they left to find a new one. I forgot what happened after that, but I do know I dozed off quickly. 

When I woke up at around 3AM, I felt extremely thirsty, so I grabbed a bottle of water that I had, but instead of the taste of minerals and h20, I tasted blood. I spat it out, only to see it had something written on it.

“Here’s a gift for buying at our restaurant, here’s more of Ethan’s blood!”
