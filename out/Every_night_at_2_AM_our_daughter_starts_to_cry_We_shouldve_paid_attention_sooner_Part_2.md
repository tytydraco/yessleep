[I ducked to the right](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/134cqth/every_night_at_2_am_our_daughter_starts_to_cry_we/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), moving between a van and a parked ambulance, and darted out in front of it, doing my best to use the vehicles to shield me from my pursuers view. My head spun, moments from every true crime podcast or murder show I’d seen playing out in real time.

My arms ached with the effort of carrying my daughter while running, and I struggled to balance her with one arm while I grabbed the keys with the other, clicking the panic button as I scanned the cars around me for any sign of mine.

Several rows ahead, I could hear it, and see the blare of its lights glowing from behind the other vehicles. It seemed all the motivation my body needed to conjure up some extra bit of speed, as I could hear the footsteps behind me approaching.

The car came into view, one row ahead, the sight of it making my heart lurch. Every second spent covering the distance between it was excruciating, and every hair on the back of my neck was at attention, prepared to feel someone yank me back.

I was nearly there, I could almost reach out and grab the handle when I felt the hand on my shoulder firm, nearly making me lose my balance.

“NO!” I shrieked, finally finding my voice as I spun around and tried to fight my captor, only to feel a firm set of arms pull Abigail from my grasp.

In my panic, I felt my boots catch against each other and I fell back, sliding back against the car and onto the ground with a force that made my teeth clatter.

“Leanne, it’s me! Relax, baby, it’s me…”

Even through my terror, I recognized Allen’s voice. Immediately the fear dissipated giving way to a strange and over-powering sorrow. I fell into his shoulder, the tears running freely as I did so.

I was drained, both mentally and physically. And in the moment I wanted to cry, vomit, and pass out, perhaps all at once.

“I - I didn’t mean to scare you like that. I saw you running and I got worried so I hurried to catch up. What were you running from?”

I looked up at him, unsure of how to respond for a moment. There was some part of me that felt suddenly quite foolish for how I’d reacted, almost certain I’d perhaps blown things out of proportion as we sat there alone in the parking lot.

I shook my head.

“I thought I’d heard someone…it’s nothing. Let’s just go home.”

I could see in his face that he was worried, but knew better than to push any further, which I appreciated more than he could know.

“Okay,” he nodded, “I’ll get her in her seat, you just go ahead and try to doze off.”

I nodded, smiling though I felt no humor in it, as I began to round the car for the passenger side door.

It was as I was climbing into my seat, pulling the door shut with a groan that I peered out into the world beyond the window, and felt my heart stop. I swallowed hard, as I stared at the vehicle exiting from the parking lot only a few yards away, caught for just a moment beneath the street lights as it turned onto a quiet residential street.

It was immediately familiar to me, an old pickup in a shade I could only recall seeing once before. In the driveway of our neighbors house, old Mrs. Melody, the very woman who had brought Abigail to me that afternoon.

The realization made my stomach turn, and somewhere in the back of my head I could hear the doctor again.

“\*- sometimes that alarm bell in your head is going off for a reason. Trust your instincts, Mom..\*”

At that moment, though I could find no way to prove it, my instincts told me that something was going on with the woman next door, and I feared, somehow, my little girl was involved.

That night, despite my exhaustion, I doubt I slept more than three hours in total. It was a light sleep, with every stir of my daughter in bed snatching me from my slumber, as I would shoot up, scanning the darkness beside me until I was certain she hadn’t awakened.

I wasn’t sure when, if ever, she would be back in that crib. I couldn’t see myself feeling safe leaving her in her room alone again for a long while. At the very least, until we could be sure she wasn’t attempting any more midnight escapes, and god only knew how we would manage that. I couldn’t even be sure of when this had started.

At some point during one of those moments, sitting in the silence of the room, listening to the breathing of my husband and daughter over the continuous drone of the ceiling fan; the hope of sleep seemed to escape me. I sat in the darkness, my eyes adjusting to the faint light pouring through the windows, a combination of the moon and distant street lights all I had to see with.

My eyes lingered on the stuffed bear, sitting at the edge of the bed like some sentry standing watch. From the moment we’d returned, even through the mental slur of the pain-killers, it had been the first thing she’d mentioned, and Allen had brought it to the room for her.

I had moved it at some point, after rolling onto the thing only to be awakened by the sensation of it digging into my back, something in it firm and hard, complete with some pointed edge I could feel. 

The sight of it there in the dark, sitting there unmoving, with its blank glass eyes peering forward seemingly through me, made me feel a strange sort of distress.

I’m not sure how much time passed with me tossing and turning in the vain hope that sleep may lie in the next position, but I found my eyes kept lingering back towards that damned bear. 

I glanced beside me, confirming that both Abigail and Allen were sleeping soundly, as I edged towards the end of the bed. With one quick motion, I booted the thing off the bed, those eyes watching me accusingly.

It hit the ground with a thud that made me grit my teeth, peering back to ensure my daughter remained asleep, and muttering a silent thanks that she had.

I glanced over my husband's sleeping form, at the digital clock on his night stand. 1:55, it read. Only five minutes or so away from the time of our daughter's nightly tantrums. 

The thought brought on a great sense of foreboding that I couldn’t shake lying there in the darkness, massing in my chest like the tangle of so many weeds. Perhaps it was the result of a day of mishaps, leading me to feel there could only be something worse around the corner and feeding my anxiety like trees and dry brush do a forest fire.

It was ridiculous, I was certain of it. I rolled over, place my hand across Abigail as though it could bring me all the security I felt lacking in that moment.

She was there. Hurt, as much as it killed me, but safe. I couldn’t see her waking up in the next four minutes. I laid back, and forced my eyes closed, doing all I could to drag myself back to sleep.

It had only been a few minutes, my ears tuned to the alternating sounds of my husband and daughters breathing, and the whirring creak of the ceiling fan as I’d begun to drift, when I heard it.

At first, I was certain it was my imagination, the sound was so faint I could almost dismiss it as such. But no, it was far too persistent, a strange mechanical hiss, like someone had switched on a broken television somewhere in the distance, that echoed out amongst the whirring of the fan and usual murmur of the house's innerworkings.

Before I could even identify a source, I felt my heart pounding furiously against my chest. My eyes fell back on the glowing display of the clock. 

‘*2:00*.’

The timing, it seemed strangely…intentional? I could feel a chord of unease struck, reverberating through me with a chilling effect as my ears perked to listen closer. I sat up, wavering in my mind between waking up Allen or not, settling quickly on the latter. 

He had to be up in a few hours, and while I felt unsettled, I saw no need to disturb him yet. Instead, as carefully as I could manage I slid out from beneath the covers, and stepped gingerly out of bed. The wooden floorboards creaked their protest, making me grimace as I watched Abigail stir.

After seconds passed without another movement, I felt okay to chance another careful step forward. My ears felt tuned as I listened for that sound, louder it seemed, now that I was really listening for it. I could think of nothing in my room that could be responsible for it, save for perhaps the white noise machine I hadn’t used in months, and that was much louder.

No, this sound brought to mind something else. It was oddly reminiscent of the static one might hear on a walkie-talkie or something of the like.

I had owned one during my childhood, which I’d used to talk to some of my friends in the neighborhood, and as I inched across my bedroom floor, gripped by the quiet and frigid night air that seemed to hang heavy in the room, it was all I my mind could conjure.

I stepped forward again as delicately as I could manage, my eyes scanning the dim light as best as they could, though I was relying almost entirely on my hearing to guide me. That mechanical hiss was growing louder with each step, somewhere to the right of me it seemed, near the foot of the bed.

I could feel my heart in my throat with every footfall, my mouth running dry as the hairs on the back of my neck rose with the creep of anxiety. 

It was louder now, so much so that I was beginning to worry it might wake my family, a series of cracking and popping noises audible amongst the hissing. It seemed to be coming from more than one place, though the noise faded in and out, I was almost certain it was coming from two different directions.

The thought made my skin crawl and the pit in my chest widened, as though I was being surrounded by something unseen, my home invaded by spectersI could only listen for.

It was then that I heard it, faint but unmistakable. A voice, from amidst the disembodied static.

“*...hello?*”

In the moment, I could have sworn my heart stopped, an icy shock tore through me as though I’d just been submerged in freezing waters.

My eyes scanned the darkness, wide and searching for anything that might be the source of the sound. 

“Babe?” 

I leapt, nearly losing my balance as I stumbled away from the sudden sound, only to glance over and see Allen sat up in the bed.

He looked tired, and confused more than anything, hands running over his eyes, but after a few moments I could see that he, too, could hear it.

“What the hell is tha -”

“*..little bear….you there?*” 

I sucked in a breath, head spinning with such force I was certain I might fall out from the sheer panic starting to flood my system. That voice again amongst that phantom static, raw and hissing. 

Our eyes met, and I felt a surge of some gruesome satisfaction that I wasn’t alone, he heard it too.

“*...are you there?*”

I spun to face behind me, certain I could hear that voice drifting from somewhere over my shoulder, and found only an empty room to greet me.

From behind me again, the static grew louder, and for the first time since it had appeared, I could pinpoint from where. 

My eyes fell on the baby monitor on our nightstand. Its lights glowed with the hiss of the audio, sparking with color the louder it grew. Allen followed my gaze, snatching it up in one quick motion, before pressing the button to respond.

“Who the fuck is this?”

There was a shrill sound, like the squeal of audio feedback that made us both cringe, and set Abigail to stirring immediately, followed by an echo, as though his voice was being played back simultaneously  from…somewhere else, somewhere nearby, ceasing only when Allen released the monitor. 

In an instance, it was all gone. The air hung heavy with an electric sort of surreality, like the early moments of some waking nightmare, yet there was nothing but the usual sounds of our home to fill its void. The room was silent, or as close as it could be anyways. 

Abby had begun kick up, though still asleep, she was starting to wake - the sounds finally growing too much for her, and I could hear the beginnings of a tantrum building as sleep began to wane.

For several moments, Allen and I lingered in place, our eyes locking, a coiling tension passing between us both. In an instant, a thought crossed my mind, and before I could even think things through clearly, I was out of our room and hurrying across the hall towards Abby’s.

The door loomed ahead, as ominous as a gravestone, my mind fully prepared to meet the intruder I knew must be on the other side. I could all but see it, some figure clad in shadow, hunched over the baby monitor in my daughter’s room, the thought filled me with terror and a rage like nothing I had ever felt.

It was the only thing I could think of at the moment that made some sort of sense. It was obvious that whoever we had just heard had been trying to speak to our daughter, and I could think of no other way we would have heard them over her monitor.

“Janet, where are you going? Stop, wait!” Allen’s foot falls grew heavy as he rushed ahead of me, putting himself between me and the door.

He shook his head, eyes locking with mine, a look that was part confusion, but a majority of visible worry etched on his features. 

“I’ll check, you - stay behind me, we don’t know who might be in there.”

I nodded, still nudging him forth until he was pushing the door open. As we pushed into the room my eyes fell immediately on the nightstand.

The baby monitor sat untouched. Allen began to search the room, flicking on the lights and checking under the bed, and in the closet. All the while I found myself lost in thought as I looked at the monitor, I was all but certain it had to be the source of the voice and yet…there was no one.

The thought should have been comforting, but it only made my fear grow thicker. 

“*...awake, little bear?*” 

Allen shot up, stiffening as he turned to face me. Our eyes locked, an unspoken terror shared between us, as the two of us hurried back to our bedroom. 

“What the fuck is going on?” Allen’s voice betrayed the discomfort we were both feeling, as he grabbed the baby monitor from the nightstand.

“Who the fuck is this?” he growled into the receiver, “I swear to God I’ll -”

“Just turn it off!” I couldn’t take it anymore, that sound, the way the air seemed uncomfortably heavy with a strange sort of unearthliness. 

He stared at me, reluctant, before finally switching it off. 

The device went silent, and yet for a few moments, I could have sworn I still heard it. That faint hiss of static still hanging in the air, persisting somehow despite the monitor being off. A squeal, like the feedback of a microphone pierced the air, making the both of us jump.

It was gone, as soon as it started, leaving only the thud of my heart and a buzzing unrest in the air in its place.

Abby began to stir, angry coo’s soon turning into a full out tantrum. Allen and I said nothing, neither knowing what could be said to do away with the strangeness of the night. 

“I’ll take care of her…” I finally said, scooping her up and off the bed.

“Okay.” Allen said, his voice hard with a sort of anger I’d never heard from him before, as he busied himself yanking the cord out of the wall and gathering the components of the baby monitor.

When he finished wrapping the cord around the monitor and shoving it into his pocket, he faced me with a sigh.

“I’m gonna look the house over, be sure there’s no one here. After that, I’m throwing this shit out.”

I nodded. While it was clear he was agitated, the events of the night finally wearing down his nerves, I didn’t feel as if he was wrong.

It felt like even then, I could still hear that voice. A man’s, rasping and old, echoing in my head as it beckoned for some “little bear”.

“I’ll try to get her back to sleep. Tomorrow, I’ll call the police to file a report, maybe see if they’ll come out and,” I shrugged, “I don’t know, scan the house or something.”

He nodded, making his way towards the door, where he paused to face me.

“Stay here with her. I don’t - I dunno, something doesn’t feel right about this.” 

“Okay.”

With that he was gone. I listened as best as I could to the sounds of his footsteps moving about the house, my heart on edge that at any moment a sudden commotion might ring out as he stumbled upon some intruder.

When none came, I let myself settle into the rocking chair we’d placed in the corner of the room, trying my best to soothe our daughter back to sleep, cradling her injured arm close. 

Allen returned minutes later. His eyes glistened with a look of utter rage, in his hands dangled a series of wires from which hung various smaller gadgets. I didn’t want to ask what they were, some part of my mind already knew the answer, and was horrified by the implications.

“Radios,” he finally said, in a voice that was strained with emotion I’d never heard from him before, “A bunch of fucking radios, one in her room, one in the living room, and a fucking camera in the [garage.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/SetiStories/)
