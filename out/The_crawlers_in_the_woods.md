It was a typical Saturday morning when I got a text.
It was from my friend Ava asking me if I was still coming to the sleepover.
I sent her a quick response, the short word “yes”, and turned my phone back off. 
Maybe if I hadn’t sent that response none of this would’ve happened. 
I looked around my now neat and tidy room, and at my backpack lying on my bed. I didn’t pack much. I never really do. All I had in the bag were pajamas, spare clothes, a toothbrush and toothpaste, my phone charger and my hairbrush. 
I moved towards my window, opening it fully. 
I stuck my head out, feeling the cool autumn breeze brush through my hair. I looked out at the field behind my house. The field I would have to walk through to get to the house the sleepover is being held at. It was, at the very minimum, a two hour walk from my house to Ava’s. I could’ve driven, had my car not broken down. It was horrible timing. Not to mention my parents were out at the time. 
I looked towards the field once more before finally shutting the window. I grabbed my backpack off my bed and got ready to head out.
I grabbed my phone, checking the battery. 
23%.
I sighed. I thought that I would probably be able to charge it once I got to Ava’s. 
But I never made it there.
I headed down the stairs. Taking in how quiet the house was. It seemed peaceful, but there was also something incredibly eerie about how there was no noise at all. Not even the usual sounds of birds. It was simply silent.
I opened the back door and prepared for my journey. 

I walked for about twenty minutes through the seemingly endless field before I came to the forest edge. I stared into the forest, at how the light all seemed to disappear in there. I was always terrified of that forest. I was debating whether to turn back when I got another text.
“You don’t wanna miss this sleepover! It will be the best one yet!” The text read. I sighed and decided to continue on, through the forest. 
If only I hadn’t made that decision.
I trudged on through the forest, the mud beneath me had begun to stick to my shoes making this awful squelching noise every time I stepped. The forest seemed to get darker and darker as I went on. 
The absence of sounds was practically deafening itself. 
Then suddenly I heard it.
A branch had broken behind me. I turned around startled looking for the source of the noise. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I had convinced myself that it was just my imagination and that I should keep moving forward.
What a stupid decision I made.

The mud beneath my shoes had became even more sticky, almost resembling a bog at this point. I was struggling to move without getting stuck. I had gotten stuck in this particularly muddy place when I saw it. From the corner of my eye I saw this shadow run past. It was only a split second. At first I had thought it was an animal. But no animal looked like that. 
It was a slim figure with completely grey skin. It was so slim it was almost just bones. It had scruffy black hair that was almost falling off. It had no nose and dark eyes. Its smile looked human but just slightly off. Slightly sinister. 
I panicked at seeing that and pulled my leg trying to get it unstuck. I heard the creature move somewhere into the darkness. Then I heard it climb into the trees overhead. It was still a little bit behind. I tugged on my leg desperate to get free as I could hear it.
Getting closer. 
And closer.
I finally got my leg free just in time as the creature had dropped down from the trees overhead down into the place I had been standing. It let out a hiss and a guttural growl. I decided I wasn’t going to wait around to see what it was planning so I took off running. I could hear the thing behind me, gaining speed. I took a sharp left desperate to throw it off. I ended up tripping over a branch and losing both my shoes but I didn’t care. I kept running. I could hear the creature in the trees above me. And then I heard two of them. Then three. Then what sounded like a whole army. They were multiplying faster than I could think. They were gaining speed on me. I took another sharp left and saw a cave in the distance. I immediately sprinted towards it and hid inside, hoping none of the creatures saw me enter.

And that is where I am now. Inside this cave. My phone on 12%. Those things are still searching for me. I can hear their growls. Sooner or later they are going to find me. I can hear one of the creatures in the cave with me. It’s asleep. I don’t dare turn around to face it. I cannot leave the cave because I know those things will get me. I don’t even know what they are. But I know I can’t stay in here either. The one in the cave with me might be asleep for now. But I know it will awaken soon. I googled a website about ancient creatures and found I can survive by offering them another as a sacrifice instead. 
So if you’re reading this then I am sorry,
But please understand it was either you or me that survived. And I chose me.
I wish you the best of luck.
