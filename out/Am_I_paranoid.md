So I will admit, I’m very much a true crime junkie and my favorite place to hang out is r/no sleep. I’m no stranger to scaring myself with my overactive imagination and scary stories. But tonight, I may experienced something that genuinely scared me.


To introduce myself, I’m a 21 year old female, and I live down the bayou in Louisiana. I’ve rented the same house with my boyfriend, 21 yr male, in a small town with few neighbors around us. It was around 9:30 pm and I was headed home from grabbing some dinner. I was on a highway headed home, and the speed limit is 55. I passed a red light and noticed a truck going pretty slow. The truck immediately peaked my interest, not because it was memorable, but because it had a busted tail light and it was a Texas license plate. And like I mentioned, I’m from Louisiana and almost as far from Texas as possible. So Texas plates aren’t abnormal where I am, but something was telling me to take notice of this. 

As I was attempting to pass this truck, I was in the right lane, they were in the left and they were going fairly slow. And it’s common practice to tint your windows in LA ,so I could not see into their car, but they could see into mine because I had bought it without tint. As soon as I passed them, they sped up until they were passing me again. I assumed it was a teenager who wanted to race, so I just kept at the speed limit. But they slowed down until they could get in my lane right in front of me, and continued to stay there. When I would slow down, they would slow with me until we were both going well below the speed limit, and the trucks’ original speed. 

By this point I’m nervous, but thinking it must have been nothing. We get to the stop light where I have to turn right, and they get into the turning lane, then turn into the right lane. I stopped at the light, and got into the left lane because I would be turning left. Then there’s another left turn lane that I went into, but did not use my blinker this time. The truck sees this because they were going very slow, and hops all the way from the right lane, past the middle lane, and into my turning lane. 

Now, I’m shaking. I’m nervous and I’m thinking there is no way this is just a coincidence. The truck then tail gaits me onto my street and follows me. The speed limit is 35 and it is a long windy road so I took my time to get up to speed, and the truck slowed down until I could barely see their headlights. I’m waiting for them to turn off onto one of the other roads that branch off of mine, but they never do. I call my boyfriend and tell him that I may be crazy, but I needed him to come outside just in case this truck was about to pull into my driveway with me. 

I get to my driveway, pull in, and my boyfriend walks outside and into the grass to look into the road. This truck comes following me, it is going very slow, and it passes our house. I’m explaining what had just happened to my boyfriend, and he says “they were definitely following you, they just went back onto the road they were already on. My road starts and ends off of the highway mentioned earlier, so they were literally just going back the way they came. 

My boyfriend swears it’s fine and that I’m freaking out over nothing, but something about that whole situation has rubbed me wrong and has made me even more paranoid about being home alone. Does anyone have any feedback?
