Finally that day came, the day I would go to college. I was already packing my things when I noticed a box at the bottom of my wardrobe, when I picked up the box it was written in capital letters:

 PROPERTY OF SIMON - 10 YEARS OLD. 

I laughed, put the box on the bed and opened the lid sealed with tape with my pocket knife. 

Inside it looked like a time machine, there were CDs by Alice in Chains, Greeen Day, The Beatles, Nirvana; some drawings, a leather notebook, Yu Gi Oh letters, and a very old cell phone, BlackBerry.

I picked up the cell phone and I don't know exactly why but I tried to turn it on, I was surprised when the screen turned blue and the brand's logo appeared, I waited a few seconds and there was the home screen of the cell phone I had when I was 10 years old.

 I went into each app feeling nostalgia hitting me, there wasn't much after all, it wasn't a smartphone these days, the only fun thing there was the snake game. 


I went into contacts and noticed that there were a lot of calls from an unregistered number, I thought it could be an old school friend and that for some reason I didn't add the number. 

I continued my search to find out what else my old version did and ended up in the photo gallery. Wow, lots of old photos of me, my parents, my friends from school.

 As I went through one of the photos caught my attention, the photo in question showed a computer screen, in it there was a conversation in the Orkut chat of a user called: noah_gympsin87.

 I tried to read the chat but the image was very bad given the time and quality of the camera.

 I strained my eyes to see and there were three messages from this user: 

noah_gympsin87:  So...what you said yesterday...

noah_gympsin87: I saw it...and man, that's scary! 

noah_gympsin87:  The only one who also saw it was Amber, and she didn't come to school today. Let's skip school to visit her tomorrow 

As a fan of Stephen King I was very curious to know what that user and I were talking about, I went to see new photos but there were no more of the keyboard and the cell phone eventually died due to a low battery.

 There was nothing in the notebook either, it was just a sketchbook. I put the cell phone back in the box and left it in the closet.


As I finished packing my things for the move I would make the next day, that unfinished message haunted me all afternoon, I asked my parents but they both didn't know. 

They just told me that I was with a boy and a girl when I was younger and nothing more. Drug! Why can't I remember? 

That night I couldn't sleep well, I took my cell phone (the current one I use) and went to Reddit, I did what I had already read in several horror stories here, without knowing for sure if it could work, but I had to try something .

 “I'm looking for noah_gympsin87, we were talking on orkut, we studied at school in Montano, Colorado and we had a friend called Amber, could you help me?” 

I felt like an idiot for doing something like that, maybe it wouldn't even work, fuck of course it wouldn't work... 

I went to sleep.

The next morning I put the moving boxes and my backpack in my father's car, said goodbye to my mother and headed to college. 

It wasn't difficult to adapt to college, my roommate Kevin has a golden personality which I find funny. The weeks flew by between parties, studies, projects and exams.

 I had already forgotten about my past weird chat on Orkut and the request on Reddit to find the user. 

That Friday near the end of August, I was in my room finishing a review, as I had a test on Monday and that shitty material wasn't getting into my head at all, that's when my cell phone vibrated, the Reddit Icon appearing on the screen.

I unlocked it and entered the app, it was a message in my private chat, those words shook me and still shake me to this day every time I remember them. 

Amber_sunshine99:Hello Saimon, I'm Amber, do you remember me? The girl who didn't go to class that day. 

Amber_sunshine99: It's so strange for me to say this but... after you visited me that day Noah became strange, you two were actually obsessed with it. 

Amber_sunshine99:  Well, until Noah disappears and you move away with your family. Do you remember? Remember what we saw? No? Maybe it's better not to remember.
