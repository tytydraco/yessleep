I didn’t want to be here.

I *really* didn’t want to. The cruise ship was supposed to be “healing”, according to my parents. After my brother drowned three weeks ago, they didn’t know what else to do with me. I’d spent those weeks buried in my room, crying until my eyes were sore.

So, they booked me this ticket, shoved a suitcase into my hands, and told me to “enjoy the ride”.

As if I could forget about him on a stupid cruise ship.

When I was a kid, I used to love ships. I’d sit for hours on the floor with my toy cruise liner, pushing it back and forth across the carpet, imagining I’d be on one someday. My parents must’ve thought it was the same – like stepping onto a real ship would somehow fix me.

But standing there on the deck that night, surrounded by strangers and old rich millionaires dancing and laughing, all I could feel was how empty I was. My brother would always play *with* me – we wanted to go on ships *together*. Doing it alone felt like a betrayal.

I stayed near the railing, gripping the cold steel with my hands, staring out at the sea.

‘Beautiful,’ I thought to myself. For a moment, I thought maybe my parents were right. Maybe this really *could* help me. Then I remembered; it was the same water that swallowed my brother whole.

The thought destroyed me – whatever peace I’d felt drained away.

No one else noticed, of course. The music was too loud, people were too drunk, and I couldn’t even talk to anyone. *Why* would they send me here? I wanted to grieve by myself. I didn’t need this.

I turned around, ready to go to my cabin and sleep until the whole cruise was over. But on my way there – I must’ve gotten lost – I found something else. There was a narrow corridor, tucked behind a stack of unused deck chairs. At the end, a simple steel door with a round window.

There were no cameras recording this place. I also didn’t see a sign on the door which would indicate it’s for staff only.

I’m not sure why I opened it. Maybe I craved the quiet – I wanted to be alone, I’m not sure.

The air was different when I stepped through. It was colder than outside. I turned back, thinking it was a bad idea.

Too late. The door was already gone.

And ahead of me was a deck I’d never seen before.

It was *quiet*.

There were no lights or music. Just moonlight guiding me forward.

But it didn’t calm me – it made me anxious. Where was I? This place looked different to the rest of the ship. The deck was painted in a different color, the length of the deck was too long – it physically did not fit in with the ship.

“Lily?”

My heart stopped.

He was leaning against the railing, his back facing me, the way he always used to when we went to the beach.

“Daniel?” My voice cracked, but I didn’t care.

He turned, and there he was – my brother.

He didn’t look dead – in fact, he looked very much alive. Not the way I’d pictured him at the bottom of the ocean. He even smiled at me, like he always used to.

“I… you--” I couldn’t even breathe. I ran to him and wrapped my arms around him, and he hugged me back. It felt so real.

“I missed you,” he whispered.

I sobbed into his chest, my arms clinging to him. “But… you’re dead.”

“I know.” He said it so casually, I almost forgot what he even said. “But not here.”

I pulled back, trying to get my bearings. “Where is here?”

He glanced out at the water and took a second before answering. “Here, it’s… better than out there. It’s calmer. There’s no one to disturb us, and we can talk about anything. Our dreams, goals – anything.”

Something in the way he said it should’ve scared me, but it didn’t. Finally, for the first time in weeks, I was happy. Overjoyed, really.

“You don’t have to leave, Lily,” Daniel said. “Stay. It’s better if you stay.”

I nodded without even realizing it. It just felt right, while outside, everything was wrong.

He looked me in my eyes. “But tonight, you’re tired. Come back tomorrow – I’ll be waiting for you”.

I don’t even remember walking back to my cabin afterward. One second I was there with Daniel, and the next I was lying in bed.

And for the first time since he died, my nightmares subsided.  

The next night, I went back.

I told myself I wouldn’t – that it was just grief playing tricks on me. I’ve read about this online. But when the ship’s lights dimmed and everything was quieter, I found myself unable to resist.

And he was there. He was always there for me. Just like before.

We talked for hours. About the dumb movies we used to watch, the fights we had, the summer we built a raft out of wood and nearly drowned in the lake next to our town. It felt like nothing had changed.

And every night, I felt lighter.

I stopped showing up to dinners my parents had pre-paid for. I stopped going to the “relaxation” activities they had booked. I knew they’d get a call about it, but I didn’t care. I only wanted to be with my brother.

By the fourth night, I wasn’t even trying to hide it. I stayed until dawn.

Somewhere around day six, I caught my reflection in one of the glass panels on the deck. I looked tired – pale, and *so* tired. Like these conversations were sucking the life out of me.

“Don’t worry about it,” Daniel said, putting a hand on my shoulder. “You’re alright. Why not just sleep here?”

I almost said yes, but I knew I shouldn’t. I just had a gut feeling it was better if I go back to my cabin to sleep.

By day eight, even the other passengers started to notice me. I’d feel their eyes on me when I passed through the dining hall. Some looked worried; others were disturbed.

But I didn’t care. I waited for nightfall (I was always scared to sneak away during the day)

Daniel was always waiting for me with a smile on his face. There was always a new subject we could talk about – like years passed, and we had so much to catch up on.

I honestly couldn’t – and still can’t – explain what he was, how he was there with me. But being a religious person, I believed it was a miracle. I didn’t question it really – I enjoyed it, because I knew it couldn’t last forever. The cruise would end soon.

And when I told him about the cruise ending, he didn’t answer.

He looked away, then back at me with a smile.

“Then don’t leave.”

I laughed it off – after all, we both know that’s not possible. I have responsibilities back home. I just got into college, and finally managed to take up a part time job.

“Yeah, sure,” I said. “I’ll just live on a cruise ship forever.”

But Daniel didn’t laugh. He kept looking at me, serious.

“I’m not joking, Lily,” he said. “You don’t have to go back. You don’t have to feel the pain every day. You could just stay here with me. Wouldn’t that be easier?”

A chill ran down my spine. I didn’t know what to do – I stared at him, my mouth agape. I stood up and backed toward the door.

“S-Sorry, I really can’t.” I muttered.

Daniel’s expression softened. “That was too direct, I’m sorry,” he said gently. “At least… visit me once more before you leave? Just one last night. Please.”

I hesitated. Something in my mind told me to run and never come back. But then he smiled – my brother’s smile – and I felt myself nod.

The next day, I had a lot of time to think. Think about him, about my life, about the cruise. I cried – again – but this time, not from sadness, but desperation. I didn’t know what to do.

Nighttime came faster than before. I should’ve been packing my things or watching the closing ceremony. Instead, I found myself walking the same hidden corridor.

I opened the door, and Daniel was waiting.

“Hey, Lily,” he said, grinning like always. “I’m glad you came.”

“Yeah,” I whispered. “One last time.”

He didn’t respond to that – he just turned and started walking down the deck, and I followed.

But it looked different this time around.

The sky was darker, and the water below wasn’t calm. It moved violently, waves crashing against the hull. Outside – in the *real world* – there was no such thing.

“Daniel… what is this?” I asked.

He smiled, then looked down at his feet. “It’s just us now. We both know this is what you want. There’s nothing to hurt you here.”

I turned around, ready to leave, but the door disappeared in front of my eyes.

“Please, Lily. Listen to me,” he begged. “It hurts, doesn’t it? I’m also hurting. Every single day without you is hell. I can’t even believe what you’re feeling. This way… we can both be happy.”

My brother – my *real brother* – would never say that. He would never place his needs above mine. He was too selfless to do that. He knew I had a life to go back to, but now he’s only thinking of himself.

This wasn’t him.

“Daniel, stop.” I ordered. “You’re not him – he wouldn’t do this to me.”

His smile faded. His hand twitched. And the whole deck changed.

The sky above gave way to rain – water poured all over the deck, from nowhere. The ship groaned and tilted under my feet, and suddenly, I was in my brother’s room – the day after he died.

His bed was unmade, clothes piled in the corner, his photo on the nightstand.

Daniel was standing there too. He looked hurt.

“You’re really going to leave me? After everything? After I came back for you?”

The walls trembled as I stumbled backward, searching for an exit that wasn’t there.

“Please, stop this already.” I whispered.

He stepped closer. His face was twisted – I could notice sadness, anger and guilt on it. “If you go--” his voice cracked, “If you go, you’ll forget me. I’ll be gone forever.”

I shook my head. “No, I’ll remember you. The *real* you. The Daniel I loved and grew up with. Not this… hollow version of him.”

And for the first time, he looked scared.

The room spun around – but we stayed in place, like gravity didn’t affect us.

“What can I do… to be more like him?” He asked, a tear rolling down his face.

I didn’t know what to say – the sight of my brother crying broke me. I wanted to hug him – to hold him and tell him everything will be alright.

But this wasn’t him. He’s dead. I finally accepted it.

“You can’t,” I answered bluntly. “He’s gone. And there’s nothing you or I can do about that.”

The door reappeared behind me, and I ran through it.

He called after me – his voice warping into a deep and cold one. “LILY. DON’T--”

I slammed through the door.

And just like that, I was back in the narrow corridor. The cold air and rain were gone. Without looking back, I started walking forward, away from the door, each step faster than the last.

That night, I didn’t sleep much. I stayed in my cabin, clutching my brother’s old bracelet like my life depended on it.

The next morning, the ship docked.

When I got off, I looked back at the corridor one last time – half-expecting him to be there and wave at me.

But the corridor wasn’t there – it disappeared.

I stood there for a long time, staring at empty steel, replaying all the memories in my head.

And even now, weeks later, I still dream of that deck sometimes. The question now wasn’t whether it was real – because I’m sure it was.

The question now is whether I made the right [decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThalassianOrder/).
