My girlfriend Alice and I were walking home from a friend’s Christmas Eve party when something very strange happened. The weather was appropriately cold, a moderate snowfall having happened the night before, but was otherwise calm—free of even wind. Alice had noticed a big Santa Claus statue in someone’s yard, and was in the process of mocking an adult’s belief in—or reverence of—such a plainly fictitious creature, when out of nowhere a great plume of snow arose before us, sending flecks of snow in every direction.  

The houses that rimmed the long suburban street were suddenly blotted from sight, as were the many cars lining the curb. The next few moments brought a stifling cold, one that felt distinctly yet inexpressibly unnatural; as if the air had been transported here from super-boreal biome.  

The snow-fog seemed to swell around us, gathering into a veritable storm. I drew Alice closer to me, not wanting her to wander off and be lost in the ever-deepening whiteness. With the onset of the mini blizzard came an *even deeper* cold, unlike anything I’d ever felt before; my breath came out in frosty huffs, and my eyelashes felt heavy, laden with snowy dew. Simultaneously, we started to shiver, and instinctually held one another close.  

A tittering arose from somewhere in the now cyclonic blizzard, the direction of its source indeterminable in the hazy chaos. A subtler chill ran through me, one not born of the cold, but of terror; there was a dark evilness to that high-pitched laughter. It carried within it tones of Satanic mischief.  

I heard a voice whisper something from far off, though I only managed to catch the words, **“You think.... fiction....I’ll show you...power...even in death....”** before it faded away.  

I tried to keep on a brave face for Alice, though inwardly my soul shrank at the ominousness of it all. My spirit knew that some awful horror was lurking just beyond sight, watching us—mocking our fear and vulnerability.  

Not wanting to play into its hands, I hugged Alice close to me and pushed on, unsure of what direction we were heading yet nonetheless determined to make progress somewhere. The sounds of snow being crushed underfoot were soon blotted out by that sinister cackling, as though our black-hearted observers were keeping up with our movements. I heard nothing beyond their laughter. Its unrelenting sonic omnipresence threatened to drive me insane, becoming a full-on chorus as the seconds ticked by.  

Finally, fed up with the devilish choir, I called out to the unseen antagonists, challenging them to face us. Somehow, I managed to get the words out without my voice breaking, though I’m sure its intonation of terror was plainly obvious.  

I wish I hadn’t.  

From out of the swirling, tempestuous frost-storm came several snow-men, each bearing a smirking, fiendish face. Dead carrots, or some other, blackly tinged vegetable protruded from their horrid, rock-studded faces. Scarves adorned their necks, though it was plainly obvious that the material of which they were made was not any kind of cloth, but *flesh.* Blood dripped from the neck-wrapped flaps, staining the snow with a terrible scarlet. Sticking out of their bodies in a grisly, haphazard fashion were bones: some large, others questionably, unspeakably small. These too were slick with crimson, the freshness a morbid implication of the recency of the snow-men's crimes.  

I will not mention in detail the composition of their twisted, multi-segmented arms, and the monstrous claws at their ends. Ultimately, the horrors were abominable, their wicked, leering faces more horrifying than anything seen by Dante during his Hadean quest. Dracul and the doctor’s Monster both would have balked at the sight of these snow-bodied creatures. Beowulf would have trembled in their presences. The Crawling Chaos could not have worn a more horrific visage.  

I heard Alice whisper something in my ear, but I was so transfixed by the sheer evil of their faces that I did not understand her words. When I failed to respond, she muttered them again, this time with no small amount of urgency. “Please, do something! They’re getting closer!”  

Like starved imps advancing upon a mis-sentenced virgin at Hell’s threshold, they marched towards us with those unseemly arms outstretched. I say marched, though in the absence of legs their bodies merely slid. But the approach was evenly spaced and simultaneous, like any other army.  

Having only my wallet and phone on me, I looked around for something with which to defend us. On the ground a few feet away, just within my scope of sight, was a large branch, half-buried in the snow. Quickly I scooped it up, just as the first line of snow-men reached us. Without any kind of bid for peace, I brought the branch up and swung it laterally, hoping to lop the heads off multiple snow men at once. But the tip of the branch shattered upon impact with the head of the first snow-man.  

A great patch of snow in the thing’s head was knocked loose by the blow, revealing the glimmering sallowness of a human skull beneath. An eye-socket, filled with bloodied snow, stared at me; half a jaw bone, agape in the absence of muscle and tendon, shone sickeningly in the moonlight.  

Alice screamed, and I swiveled around, thinking that she’d run off at the grisly sight. But a moment later a large rock smashed into the snow-man, cratering its horrific face. Blood and snow went everywhere, and the fiend collapsed upon itself in a messy heap. Without hesitation, Alice retrieved the rock from the already dissolving pile, and launched it at another snow creature—screaming all the while. Still, the remaining snowmen pressed on, unbothered by their comrade’s demise. Hefting my stick, I charged forward to join Alice in the fray.  

A bloody, snowy melee then followed. It was a long, grueling battle, one in which terror threatened to drive me backwards; but Alice, enraged by the audacity of these ball-bodied brigands, kept my spirits aloft.  

We traded blows with the snow-men, barely managing to dodge their awkward and intermittently timed attacks. Those in the back of their ranks launched snowballs, though these were easily dodged due to their high-arching trajectories. Upon impact with the ground, they exploded into piles of what looked to be ice-armored worms, which wriggled and flopped about disgustingly. Alice stomped on them gleefully when she got the opportunity. I found the sight of them stomach-turning, so I avoided the artic pests whenever possible.  

Eventually, after having sustained several minor and moderate injuries, we were able to triumph against the horrors. The last of the snow-men fell from a combined attack from us, disintegrating in a violent explosion of icy debris. Alice let out a warrior’s victory cry and smeared the remains of our victim into the ground.   

Though we had not consciously expected it, the snowstorm dissipated with the downfall of that demonic horde, leaving us not far off from where we’d been before the ambush. We dropped our weapons and hugged, even as bits of snow and gore still clung to our coats. We’d won a great battle, and were elated.  

Exhausted, dripping with snow and charnel bits, we continued along our way.
