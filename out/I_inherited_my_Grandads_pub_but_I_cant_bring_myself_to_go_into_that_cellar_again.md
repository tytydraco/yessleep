I don’t think any kid likes cellars but the one in my Grandad’s pub is something else. The way the pub is laid out, is that it’s split in half between living space for the pub landlord and his family, and then the pub itself. The living space and its winding corridors and staircases are hidden behind doors which only the landlord, or in my case landlady, has the keys to. But Grandad always left them unlocked. He trusted his patrons.

The pub has to have ways for the landlord to quickly get from one area to another without having to move through a crowd of patrons. Hence the hidden corridors and stairwells. It’s the same in old houses that used to keep servants. It's more common in very old pubs, and although this one isn't one of the many that claim to be the oldest pub in England, it has medieval foundations and the walls in the pub garden are seventeenth century. The building is a pretty Victorian structure.

As a child, I made great use of the hidden passageways. What was always fun about going to visit Grandad, was getting to secretly travel through the back of the pub, and then pop up in places and freak out the punters. “How did you get there?” They’d gasp, barely holding on to their pint glasses. “I thought you were a ghost!”

My favourite regulars were the old timers. They knew all the pub ghost stories. They’d tell me about the little boy who giggles in the function room, who according to a psychic that came in once, died of TB sometime in the Edwardian era. And there's the lady who cries in the pub garden, some of the men claimed to see her in a grey apparition dressed in Victorian mourning dress. She likes to appear around midnight and doesn’t like men, which keeps them from lingering in the pub garden after chucking out time. There’s also a man in the main bar area who likes to whistle sea shanties. My Grandad likes to think he was a pirate or a smuggler. We are after all situated near the coast, and the pub may well have partaken in some free trading. I’d always sit with my elders and listen to them spin yarns until it was time for me and my cousins to go to bed upstairs.

Upstairs we have three bedrooms, a bathroom and a sitting room. Then downstairs we have a huge kitchen for making pub grub, my Grandad's office (which is now technically mine) and then, right as you approach the door to get into the main bar, are the stairs to the cellar. The pub portion of the building was renovated just after the war, but the living quarters where my Grandad lived still looked very Victorian.

The staircase isn’t quite circular but it has a bend as you walk down into the darkness of the cellar. You can only barely see the bottom of the staircase as you look down. As you lean over the banister, all you can really see is the darkness. Pure and black. Like tar. You can see all the way down into the cellar’s darkness from upstairs in the living quarters too, as it’s all one spiral staircase that connects the whole living quarters and makes it feel like a home rather than pub lodgings.

Having to pass by the cellar staircase every time you wanted to enter the main bar was always terrifying as a child. But what was even worse, was having to go down into the cellar yourself. Especially if you had to go alone. Occasionally, Granddad would ask one of us to go down and get some ice for the bar. One day my older cousin who usually did the job couldn’t be found, so the task fell to me.

“Get me some ice would you love?” He asked, handing me the shiny metal bucket from the bar. I hated saying no to the old man especially when he asked so kindly, so I did as he bid me. As if on the way to the gallows, I walked across the red patterned carpet of the main pub floor with my head lowered, dragging my feet on the floor. I raised my small hand to the door handle and opened the door to the living quarters. I stepped in and closed it behind me, the comforting sounds of the pub, old rock and roll music and chatter were blocked out in the process. I was left with an uneasy silence. The stairs to the cellar were waiting for me on the other side.

I flicked the light switch on. The cellar was flooded with yellowy light. My pleather ballet flats began to tap against the wooden stairs as I descended the curved staircase. The coldness made me come out in goosebumps. I hate that it's always cold underground. I’ve never been a spelunker. In my opinion the underground should be foreboding. It’s not meant for the living. I always think if a place is cold, damp and dark, you as a human being should know it’s not for you. Those spaces are trying to tell you that you aren’t meant for them and to stay away. Unless you’re a bat or a stalagmite.

At the bottom of the staircase was the concrete cellar floor. I pattered across the floor, trying not to stare too long down any of the little mysterious looking corridors or in the eerie dark spots where the light didn’t reach. My eyes scanned over kegs and piles of packaged cans and glass bottles. Until finally I reached the ice machine. It was an old clunky thing that whirred nosily. Another thing that still bothers me about the pub cellar is how amplified noises become. I always tried to move around that cellar like I was trying not to wake someone up. As I gently lifted up the flap of the ice machine the sound echoed throughout the cellar, as did the sound of the little plastic scoop plunging deep into the ice cubs. Then the most noisy part, of picking up scoops of ice and dropping them into my metal bucket filled the empty cellar with an awful clattering sound. I imagined, as a young girl, that what frightened me about the loud noise was that those noises could cover up small noises, shuffles or whispers. And I always liked to have all my senses available to me when I was in that cellar.

As I was finishing up collecting ice I thought I heard shuffling behind one of the doors. The cellar had some doors which were always locked. It made my hairs stand on end, but I assumed maybe it was a rat. I clutched my bucket of ice, getting ready to make a mad dash for the stairs. I imagined myself darting up the steps, smacking the light switch off and throwing the door to the bar closed behind me. I was just about to go through with my plan, feeling the adrenaline already start to kick in for my sprint, when three slow knocks came from my left. I turned slowly towards where the sound had come from. It was the old wooden door. The door was partly rotted in places. I stared at it, waiting for another set of knocks. Or maybe confirmation I had just heard a random noise and there wasn't something waiting behind the door and asking to be let out. I was also looking to see if anything was peaking from the woodworm gaps in the door.

“Hello?” I said stupidly. For a second I wondered if the sound didn't come from my mouth but rather it echoed through my head. I wasn’t entirely sure why I’d said it. I sort of felt like the words had been drawn or pulled out of me. I kept staring at the door, waiting for a response. Really, I wanted to run but couldn't unstick my feet from the floor.

“...Helloooo.” A voice greeted slowly. It drew out the vowels strangely in a faltering high pitch that made me feel sick. It reminded me of my older cousins doing an impression of me.

There was a brief pause where my dumbass child brain was trying to figure out its next move. It was complicated because, what if there was a person behind the door that needed help. What if someone was hurt behind that old door? I moved towards it.

"Helloooo."

It crooned again, beckoning me closer. It began to scratch against the door. Slowly. Almost timidly. Like a trapped pathetic animal. My hand hovered over the brass doorknob. I had no idea whether or not this door was locked but I could at least try to save the poor soul on the other side.

Then as my hand gripped the cold doorknob, there was a small shock that sent a message through my nervous system telling me that whatever had responded to me didn’t sound or seem human. It was not to be trusted. And it did not need me to save it.

Snatching my hand away, I decided to scream. In horror, I threw my metal bucket of ice at the door and bolted up the stairs not daring to even glance behind me until I reached my Grandad's side.

It might surprise you to know that I’ve been down in the cellar a lot since. Never alone. But in all states of drunkenness, at all times of day, with lots of people, with just one person, with a little cousin etcetera. Nothing has happened since that day. After that unpleasant experience as a kid we as a family all went back down there and opened that door. Which had been unlocked. There was nothing behind it except the good bottles of booze.

The pub has recently fallen into my hands. My grandfather isn’t dead but his health and memory are failing (dementia is a bitch) and he’s moved in with my uncle. No one else wanted to move down to the coast and take it over so I happily volunteered. I’m fresh out of Uni with a degree in sociology so I have no other job prospects. In truth it’s been a great relief.

I thought I had it made. I ran the place for about two great weeks, managing to covertly avoid going down into the cellar alone. I always got someone’s kid to help me carry stuff or I’d brush off the ice or keg related chores to one of the other bar staff because “I’m just so busy.” In truth it's because I’m a massive pussy. In my opinion, and I think you’ll agree, I had every right to be.

But, the other day, the time finally came where I had to go down there by myself, after a decade of somehow managing to avoid it.

It was a few hours before opening, before my bar staff were due to arrive and I realised I needed J2O’s. My instinct was to wait and get one of the staff to do it, but then I thought; what kind of pub landlady can’t even go down into her own cellar. Determinedly, I marched through my pub, thudding down the steps that were so old they bowed in the middle and creaked with every step. I made my footsteps purposefully loud to prove a point. I was an adult. And a landlady. And a big strong independent woman and all that. Whatever I’d heard as a child could’ve been my imagination. Maybe one of my cousins played a trick on me they never owned up to. Maybe Grandad has a sound activated something or other to keep us away from the good booze.

I looked around my cellar trying to enjoy my organised shelves and thinking up ways I could modernise the space. The quiet cool of the cellar was actually quite peaceful once you got over the sense of looming, foreboding, dread and doom.  I scanned my shelves looking for the bottles of J2O I needed to restock. I plucked the packet of small bottles from the shelf then paused. I heard nothing, not even a shuffle. Just the still quiet of the cellar punctuated  by the whirring of the ice machine. Still I began to feel uneasy. I decided I’d made my point and it was time to leave. I always think you should trust your instincts on things like that. I think a sense people often ignore but should heed more than anything is when your body tells you it’s time to leave. I told myself I’d stay longer next time. Then a little more the next time. But now, it was time to go.

Quickly, I climbed the stairs, half expecting something to grab me along the way or to hear something thud up the steps behind me. But nothing did. I got to the top of the stairs and reached the hallway just fine. As I took one last look down into the cellar, I opened the door to the pub. I smiled to myself, enjoying the feeling of having conquered a deep childhood phobia.

I took the box of bottles behind the bar and started restocking. As I restocked I started to think, quite cockily, that being a pub landlady might be my calling. Now that I’d conquered the basement all I needed to do now was avoid becoming a Wetherspoons and I’d be set for life. I loved the pub and all the memories it had in its walls. I loved being by the coast and I also owed it to Grandad and our regulars to keep the place running.

As I placed the last bottle into the fridge, I heard three knocks from the door to the living area. Being lost in thought the sound made me jump and almost drop said bottle.

“You’re early!” I called out to who I assumed was a member of my bar staff.

There was no response.

“Make me a tea if you’re going to the kitchen please…”

No response again.

“Oi!” I snapped. That didn’t work either.

“Hello!” I yelled into the empty pub, the sound reverberating through the air. There was a lengthy silence. Then finally, I did hear something. I heard a quiet, strained voice which sounded like it was coming from behind the door. I stepped out from behind the bar and began walking towards the sound. As I got closer, it started sounding like a child. I put my ear to the door, wondering if a kid had wandered in from outside somehow or maybe even broken in. Then, in a voice which sounded all too familiar something from behind the door ground out in a flattering and sickening high pitched mockery of my voice:

“...Hellloooo.”
