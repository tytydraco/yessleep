It was almost three AM, but I couldn't leave the phone screen. I had this persistent feeling of something bad or paranormal happening if I did.

I was initially trying to tell myself that that feeling isn't real, and that paranormal activity was removed from my house after the spell I casted weeks ago.  But I eventually gave up and stayed awake for the next half hour.

It was already 3:30 AM, I was exhausted and wanted to sleep but couldn't. I had a mirror next to me which just made my fear worse, as I thought the mirror would show me something paranormal or scary if I looked at it.

I finally left my phone, which was followed by a deep screeching noise. I couldn't even move afterwards, I was scared, I didn't know what to do, I didn't know where that noise came from, I didn't know if it was real or fake, I couldn't understand anything. 

I tried to grab my phone again but some sort of impulse, which I assume was one of the less powerful demons , suddenly gained control over my body, and threw my phone at the mirror. 

I panicked. Was I in the middle of another demonic possession? Was I just delusional again? Did demons come back to my house? Should I expell them?

I looked at the mirror...

It showed a face similar to mine, with a deep, psycopathic and evil smile. That smile, it was getting closer to me every milisecond. I was sure it was a demon trying to possess me.

That creature, which resembled me (almost like a demonic version of me), left the mirror. The creature approached me afterwards. The creature told me the following words: Lucifer is near, why did you have to invoke him? You made a grave mistake.

I don't exactly remember what happened next, I just woke up next morning in the floor just outside of my apartment. Probably a demon appeared and dragged me outside.

I had already scheduled an appointment with my psychiatrist for the next day since a week before, I was thinking whether I should tell him all of this or not. I did not want to be hospitalized again.

After I told my psychiatrist, he prescribed me with medication as he claims I'm having a extreme psychosis relapse, but I don't want to take it, I don't want to be that zombie again. 

I will cast a spell to remove all the demons from my house instead of taking that fucking medication, but I don't know if it will be powerful enough to fight against lucifer itself. As I don't have any experience fighting creatures that powerful.

Nobody believes me when I tell them all of these and everyone just gaslights me and points out to my diagnosis, but I'm sure this is real. I have entered the demonic realm, something which very few humans have achieved, and those who have are marginalized by everyone in both the human and demonic realms.
