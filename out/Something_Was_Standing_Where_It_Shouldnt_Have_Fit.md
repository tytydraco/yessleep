I’ve always liked places people stopped paying attention to.

Urban exploration is mostly abandoned buildings for me—factories, old housing developments, anything left half-finished or forgotten—but sometimes the hardest part of getting to those places is the land around them. Old service roads that don’t show up on maps anymore. Trails that only exist because they used to.

That night, I was following one of those.

The path barely counted as a trail. The ground was flattened just enough to suggest people had walked there once, but the forest had mostly taken it back. Branches hung low. Roots crossed the dirt like veins. I had to watch my footing more than usual.

I wasn’t nervous. I’d done this enough times to know when a place felt off, and this didn’t. It was quiet, but normal quiet. Bugs. Wind in the canopy. Nothing that set off alarms.

What I noticed first was how tight the trees were.

They grew close together in that stretch of forest, trunks packed so tightly that in some places I had to turn sideways to pass through. It made everything feel narrower than it should’ve been, like the woods were slowly compressing.

Still, nothing unusual.

I was about halfway down the path when I caught movement to my right.

Not a shape. Just something tall interrupting the darkness for a split second.

I stopped and turned my head.

Nothing.

I didn’t think much of it. Headlamps flatten distance. Shadows stack. If you look for long enough, your brain starts inventing edges where there aren’t any.

I kept walking.

A minute later, it happened again.

Same side. Same height. Gone the moment I tried to focus on it.

That’s when I slowed down.

Not stopped. Just slower. More deliberate. I told myself I was tired, that my eyes were adjusting, that this was what being alone in the woods at night did to people.

But the feeling didn’t go away.

It was subtle at first. A sense of something being slightly misplaced. Like seeing a door cracked open in a room you’re sure you closed.

Then it clicked.

The glimpses were coming from spaces that were too small.

The trees in that area were close together. I’d already had to squeeze through a few gaps. Whatever I was seeing was upright in places where there shouldn’t have been room for anything that tall.

I stopped walking.

I stood there and listened. The forest sounded the same as it had a minute ago. No sudden silence. No animals fleeing. Just night sounds continuing like nothing had changed.

I stared straight ahead and didn’t move my head.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw it again.

Clearer this time.

Tall. Narrow. Standing between two trees that were barely two feet apart.

My chest tightened.

I turned my head to look directly at it.

It slipped behind the tree.

Not vanished.

Hidden.

The darkness snapped back into place too neatly, like something had pulled itself out of sight at the last possible second.

I felt my heart rate jump. I kept my eyes locked on the tree it had moved behind, waiting for it to come back out.

It didn’t.

I blinked.

The space was empty.

Then I saw it again, closer now, partially hidden behind a different tree. Its body was folded inward, shoulders drawn tight, head lowered too far, like it was trying to reduce itself without understanding how proportions worked.

It wasn’t reacting to sound.

It was reacting to where I looked.

I backed up slowly. My neck started to ache almost immediately from holding my head at an awkward angle. Every time my gaze drifted even slightly, it repositioned itself—sliding sideways, tucking behind another trunk, pressing itself flat against bark that should not have been wide enough to hide it.

It wasn’t rushing.

It was waiting.

That scared me more than if it had charged.

I whispered “no” under my breath.

The moment the word left my mouth, it moved faster.

Not toward me. Around me.

It began circling, shifting positions with unsettling efficiency. When I turned my head, it was already gone, folded behind another tree. When I tried to track it indirectly, it adjusted, always staying just out of full view.

My eyes burned. I knew I couldn’t keep this up forever.

I needed cover.

I dropped low and moved off the trail, crouching behind a fallen tree that lay half-buried in leaves. I pressed myself against the damp wood and killed my headlamp.

The forest went darker than I expected.

I stayed still, barely breathing, listening.

At first, I thought it had lost me.

Then I saw it.

It stepped—no, settled—into a gap between trees about fifteen feet away. From where I was hiding, I had a clear view.

The thing was taller than I’d thought. Its limbs were too long, its torso stretched thin, like it had been pulled upward and never quite settled back into place. Its joints bent where they shouldn’t, locking and unlocking slowly as it adjusted its stance.

Its head lifted slightly.

I saw its face then.

Not clearly. Not enough to describe. Just the sense of a face that didn’t understand how faces were supposed to work. The eyes were set wrong. Too far down. Too close together. Focused on the space I occupied, even though it couldn’t see me directly.

It stood there, perfectly still.

Waiting for me to move.

A leaf shifted under my boot.

That was enough.

It unfolded.

The movement was horrible to watch. Its limbs straightened too far, then compressed again as it lunged forward, not crashing through the forest but flowing through it. Trees didn’t slow it down. Gaps opened where there shouldn’t have been gaps.

I ran.

I didn’t bother with the trail. I crashed through brush, branches tearing at my arms, lungs burning. Behind me, I could hear it moving—not heavy, not frantic, just constant.

Every time I risked a glance back, it was closer.

Not because it was fast.

Because it didn’t have to go around anything.

It narrowed itself, angled its body, slipped through spaces that should have stopped it cold. Its proportions corrected mid-motion, limbs bending and folding to fit whatever space it needed.

I burst into the clearing where I’d parked my car and nearly tripped on the gravel. The open space felt unreal after the trees.

I fumbled for my keys, dropped them, snatched them up again, and threw myself into the driver’s seat.

I slammed the door and locked it just as something tall slipped to a stop at the edge of the trees.

It didn’t step into the open.

It stood there, half-hidden, folded neatly between trunks that shouldn’t have been able to conceal it, head tilted like it was memorizing the distance.

I drove away without turning the headlights off it.

I don’t go exploring tight places anymore.

Because now I know there’s something out there that understands how much space it’s allowed to take up.

And it’s learning how to take more.
