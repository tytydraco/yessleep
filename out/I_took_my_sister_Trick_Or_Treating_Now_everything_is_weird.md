 Something is wrong with my little sister Danielle.  

My mom had to work late, so I was forced to take my sister Trick Or Treating. It wasn’t fair, I had plans to go out with my friends and here I am playing babysitter.  

To kick things off, Danielle was acting like a little shit because Mom told me to make her wear a coat.  

“Scarlet Witch doesn’t WEAR a winter coat,” Danielle said. 

“Yeah, well little girls who ruin their big sister’s plans do, so put it on!” 

She stomped her feet and put the coat on. Danielle was right. It looked ridiculous. Her cape hung out of the back of her coat.  

For the first few houses she remained pissy, but by the fifth door she was just happy to get free candy.  

“Halloween is the greatest don’t you think?” 

I looked up from my phone to grunt at her.  

“Happy Halloween,” kids shouted at the people waiting at the door.  

People (let’s face it. OLD people) always tell me how there were way more kids out Trick Or Treating way back when. One thing I kinda get, is why do some kids skip like half a block, hit one house, then skip the rest of the block. Like, I get at some point it’s more about meeting up than the candy. But why walk around the whole fucking town to hit ten houses. 

Boys were wearing little league baseball uniforms (not even a costume), Black Panther, Spiderman, and hockey masks while carrying machetes. 

Girls were dressed up like princesses, characters from Z-O-M-B-I-E-S and twinsies with their moms. It was especially gross when the Mom was skanky. 

Parents were taking pictures and the boomers went gaga for all the toddlers in their cute costumes. 

My phone kept going off, but every time I tried to check it Danielle threw a fit. 

“If you get to check your phone, I get to eat candy!” 

“No, Mom has to check it all”.  

“You ate a piece!”  

“I’m not stupid enough to eat tampered candy”.  

She glared at me but ran to the next door. 

My phone started to ring. It was Kelsey. I turned my back for a moment and picked up. 

“Hey, are you coming over tonight?” 

“I’m out with Danielle Trick Or Treating”. 

“You’re Trick Or Treating?” 

“No, I took Danielle”. 

“Darius is going to be here”.  

“I can’t come over until my Mom comes home”. 

”You better hope she’s early. Jackie’s coming too”. 

Before I could say anything, I heard a scream. 

“I gotta go,” I said and hung up. 

Danielle was panting holding her hand.  

“What happened?”  

“Something bit me!” 

“WHAT?!?!” 

“It was little and had horns and....” 

“Horns? Are you kidding me?” 

I looked at her hand. No blood, just the imprint of teeth. 

“You just bit yourself to get attention. That’s it, we’re going home”. 

“No!” 

“Excuse me?” 

“You make us go home I'm telling Mom I got bit when you were talking on the phone”. 

We hit every house between here and home. As we headed home, she started walking weird and grunting. Once we got through the front door she ran upstairs. Little dork didn’t even thank me. 

I put on some old horror movie and made some popcorn. Jackie was probably flirting with Darius right now. Thanks Mom. 

There was a huge thud upstairs. I went up to see what was happening.  

“Danielle, are you okay?” 

I heard giggling by the door. Creepy giggling. 

“Is someone in there with you?” 

She giggled again. 

“Fine, be weird”. 

I went to get a pop from the fridge, but all that was left was Mom’s cream soda. A Coke or some Green River was an ask too much. I grabbed a glass and turned on the faucet. Black sludge shot out instead of water. All of a sudden, the whole house smelled like shit.  

Since the faucet in the kitchen was gross, I decided to get some water from the bathroom upstairs. As I climbed the steps, I saw Danielle’s Jack O Lantern light up. Some trick candle? 

When I got to the sink upstairs, I turned the handles full blast. No water came out. I put my face on the sink rim trying to see up the faucet. I saw something out of the corner of my eye. A bunch of spiders crawled out of the drain. They started falling out of the sink and tumbling to the floor. I slammed the door to keep them in.  

The walls in the hallway were bleeding. All of the pictures flew off the wall. I heard the giggling again in Danielle’s room. 

I kicked in her door and shouted for her. She wasn’t in her bed or at her desk. I opened the door to her closet, but she wasn’t in there. 

There was panting behind me. I turned around and saw Danielle squatting upside down on the ceiling. Her eyes were black and juicy, her mouth hanging open. Some sort of slime was dripping from her mouth. Without moving her lips, she asked me a question. 

“Can I have some candy?” 

I ran out of her room and shut the door. The floor of the hallway is covered in blood. Tiny, black legs are reaching under the bathroom door. 

I tried calling the cops, but they thought it was a prank. One came by, but he said he was too busy for my bullshit tonight. I should be grateful he wasn’t filing a report.  

When is my Mom coming home? What the Hell is going on?
