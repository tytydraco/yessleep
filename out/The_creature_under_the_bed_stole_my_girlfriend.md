Lacy won the stuffed teddy bear at the local fair. She gave me the bear and I bought her a deep fried slice of cheesecake on a stick in return. That must have been our first date, maybe second if you count walking her home from class as a date. The teddy bear had always been here, even when she wasn’t, and she certainly wasn’t here now. I tossed the bear up and up again, catching it over and over in my outstretched hands as I laid on my bed thinking about what I’d done wrong. Toss and catch. Toss and catch. Toss and catch. The smell of her perfume is embedded in the fluffy fur of the bear. She must have sprayed it when I wasn't looking. Toss and catch. Toss and catch. Toss and catch. Maybe I should have made more time for her. Maybe I should have sent her flowers. Maybe I could salvage this if I came up with a damn good apology.

Maybe, maybe, maybe. Toss and catch. Toss and catch. Toss and catch. Maybe, maybe, maybe. The repetition, and general emotional exhaustion, lulled me into an unexpected sleep. The fragrant teddy bear lay nestled in the crook of my arm as I snoozed in a dreamless twilight with the light of my bedside lamp still illuminating the bedroom. Shifting slightly into a more comfortable position, the stuffed animal rolled away from my body and tumbled noiselessly over the edge of the bed and onto the carpet below. The slight change in pressure was just enough to pull me from my slumber. I rolled to the edge of the bed and reached down, down towards the floor to recover the bear and, hopefully, return to sleep in only a moments time.

That's exactly how it would have happened had I not laid eyes on a sight that made me feel more awake than any every cup of coffee I'd ever ingested, combined. There, beside my own outstretched palm, was another that did not belong to me. Nor could it have reasonably been mistaken for mine. This hand, which stretched out from beneath the bed skirt, was gnarled with burl-like knuckles and long gaunt fingers, adorned each with a cracked yellow fingernail. As I watched from atop the bed, the hand stretched slowly out, out, out until an entire spindly arm appeared. Flesh sagged about the bones within like Victorian drapery. It didn't occur to me that I should panic, so I didn't. I'd never been in a situation like this before-- I wasn't entirely convinced I was in a situation like this right now-- so the thought that I could scream or gasp or run away simply never entered my mind.

The calloused fingertips clutched the teddy bear around his soft middle and pulled it rather gently across the carpet until it disappeared completely into the chasm behind the bed skirt. The faint smell of perfume lingered in the air. The now empty space beside the bed was filled with two simple words, "Thaaank yooouuu." The voice, which was almost a whisper, echoed slightly from below. Even then, I did not panic. Then, more than ever, the soft sheets and doughy pillows called to me. I switched off the lamp, and my mind, and fell quickly into a deep and restful sleep.

*The buzz buzz buzz* of my cell phone awoke me the next morning. "Hello?" I yawned. The reply was far too loud and far too excited for whatever time it was. "Yoooo, wake up! I'm outside and I brought bagels." Brad was indeed outside and he was, in fact, carrying a brown bag full of bagels in his hands. He settled at my kitchen table and explained that he had heard about Lacy, through a series of he-said she-said type chains, and wanted to bring something he knew would cheer me up-- breakfast. Usually, he would have been correct. Except I hadn't thought of Lacy yet that morning and the mention of her name had the dual purpose of reminding me to be sad and disappearing any hunger I might have felt.

Not to mention that I had lost the teddy bear, my only tangible reminder of our relationship. Oh, shit. The teddy bear. I ran from my kitchen table into my bedroom and threw up the bed skirt, hoping to see the stuffed toy on the carpet beneath the bed. Nothing. Crawling on my hands and knees around my room, I checked every conceivable stuffed animal sized crevasse. Nothing. Brad watched from the doorway, half eaten bagel in hand. "Whatcha doing?"

"You would not believe me if I told you," I replied.

"Try me," he said. Realizing that I must already look insane, I conceded that I may as well sound it too. We returned to the kitchen table where I regaled him with a detailed account of my encounter with the creature. He listened intently, throwing in the occasional "mhm" or "oh, really?" for encouragement. When I had finished my tale, I eyed him expectantly.

"Dude," he said, "I mean this with, like, lots of love and stuff. I think you're just all tore up about Lacy and you had a nightmare. Or maybe it was one of those sleep paralysis demons or something. Ya know?"

We talked back and forth, back and forth, for ages. I swore it was real. He was adamant that I was experiencing some non-descript form of psychosis. Eventually, he convinced me that I had binned the bear in a fit of rage and rationalized its absence in a nightmare about a monster under my bed, all as the result of my intense emotions over the breakup. Say what you want about Brad, but he's a solid amateur psychologist. Anyway, the entire episode was immediately forgotten when Lacy texted me later that evening: *I miss you*.

Lacy and I spent the next few months rekindling our relationship. The fair was on again so we went and spent a bit of time making out at the height of the Ferris wheel. We went to the movies. To restaurants and bars. To parties. And, of course, we spent many a night at my apartment, away from the prying eyes of onlookers who may sneer at our open affection. Things between us were perfect. Absolutely perfect. The type of perfection that can only be achieved when you blissfully and intentionally ignore each and every glaring issue for the sake of enhancing an illusion.

She slammed the door of my apartment, setting the picture frames on the surrounding walls askew. "You're an asshole, Ben. Do NOT call me!" she screamed from behind the closed door before storming down the hall and away from our relationship, again. In that moment, I did the only thing I knew to do. I ran into my bedroom, threw myself onto my bed, and cried into my pillow like a princess locked in a tower. The sadness lasted an hour or so before it was replaced by red hot anger. Her face, smiling at me from the framed photo on my nightstand, made my stomach bubble. I grabbed the frame and threw it onto the floor, hoping it would shatter into unrecognizable pieces.

Hot tears streamed from the corner of my eyes into my sideburns as I stared at the ceiling, wishing a portal to space would open and suck me into the deep, black void where I'd never have to worry about love or romance again. Minutes ticked by one second at a time as I pondered the void, only pulled back to my miserable reality by a voice in the dark. "Thaaank yooouu," it groaned into the room where silence used to be. I threw myself across the bed and peered over the edge, just in time to see the corner of the picture frame disappear, pulled under by the very tips of too-long fingers with too-long fingernails.

This time I remembered that I was a being with free will and, as such, I chose to panic. The tears on my face were replaced by cold sweat. The heaving sobs of moments ago were replaced by shallow breaths that did almost nothing in the way of oxygen circulation. My fingers wished desperately to flip the switch on my lamp and expel the menacing shadows from the room but they were frozen in place, clasped tightly around my legs as I laid in the fetal position above the comforter for the following six hours or so.

The next morning, when Brad arrived with bagels, I decided not to tell him about the picture frame, lest I be involuntarily committed to a psych ward. I'd searched beneath the bed on my own before his arrival and discovered not a single remnant of the frame or the photo within so, really, what was there to say, anyway? We ate our bagels, loaded as they were with heaps of cream cheese, in relative silence, punctuated occasionally by one or the other of us suggesting that I was better off without her anyway. This was true, of course. I was better off without her. Though, I forgot that almost immediately as soon as she reappeared on my doorstep a few weeks later.

The steam from the shower stuck to the mirror, which annoyed Lacy who was trying to apply eyeliner in preparation for the wedding we were set to attend that evening.

"What?" she asked.

I pulled back the shower curtain to hear her better, "what?"

She rolled her partially lined eyes. "What did you say a second ago?"

I closed the curtain. "I didn't say anything."

She'd finished her makeup by now and was storming about the room like a whirlwind looking for this accessory and that. "Ugh!" she moaned, "Where are my sandals? Have you seen them? I swear I left them right here next to the bed." She knelt down and searched the entire perimeter of the bed, even checking the small space between the bedframe and nightstand. No sandals. I shrugged. "I haven't seen them but we don't have time to keep looking. We should have left 20 minutes ago. Just wear your heels." She begrudgingly complied and, within two minutes, we were off to drink too much and exhibit poor judgement in dance moves.

That evening, we stumbled through the front door, releasing one *tee-hee* and *ha-ha* after another into the dark apartment. We staggered towards the bed, shedding high heels and neckties along the way before collapsing into a puddle of giggles and fits. It was so nice to see her smiling. I didn't want her to stop for even a moment. I reached out to tickle her. Her laugh rang out like a windchime as she reached to push my hands away. "Come on, Ben," she gasped between cackles, "Stop! I can't breathe." I intended to stop after just another moment but, before I did so, she wiggled out of my grasp and popped over the side of the bed. She landed on the carpet with a dull thud. I rolled onto my back and clutched my stomach, which shook from the force of escaped laughter.

It took a moment for me to quiet down enough to realize that she wasn't laughing anymore. "Awe, Lacy. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--" The words caught in my throat as I leaned over the bed to help her up. The hand again. I recognized the bulging knuckles, this time clutched firmly around her ankle. She stared silently, as I did, tears welling in her wide eyes, as the face of the creature emerged from beneath the bed. Its saggy flesh hung about the face in sheets. Its pallid eyes, sunken deep within the skull, were set firmly on Lacy. It did not turn to look at me as it spoke. “Thaaank yoouuu."

She let out a partial scream before she was dragged, almost in one motion, beneath the bed and out of my life forever. Of course, I searched desperately for any trace of her in the void beneath the bed, though I knew by now that what was taken by the creature was taken completely. I can only hope that, wherever she is, she is hugging the stuffed teddy bear and thinking of me.
