I have recently moved to a small town far from my usual stomping grounds in Indianapolis, after some time and accidental mismanagement of money, I thought it best to get away from my debtors and clients. For clarity, those businesses that seem to be run by no one in particular, and appear in your towns very well could’ve been one of mine. I worked in asset management for years and usually got clients who only wanted to make their inherited businesses fade into the background and earn money.

Well, I was all too good at making them fade and that’s where I am now, sitting in a diner in some no-name town (there wouldn’t be much point naming it in my escape entry), and writing to each of you, honestly I need my thoughts out there, hopping from labor job to labor job doesn’t lead to much conversation, and I’ve gone kinda stir crazy holding everything in, and in short I have found far too much trouble that I was trying to escape in the first place.

As I was sitting here in my duct tape-patched booth, chain-smoking and tearing up over stale coffee, a young man approached me during the first draft of this, so sorry for any mistakes I promise it won’t happen again. He didn't seem a threat but I have been on edge and his disheveled black suit didn’t make me any less so.

He took a seat not bothering to ask me and began talking as if we’d been best of pals

“Samuel, long time no see,” he said eying the lit cigarette in my hand

“Sorry, do I know you?”

“No, but I’ve known you” 

I always carried a firearm with me since I got in the business but with both my hands over the table, I was trapped by convention, and the man just looked at me concerned 

“That wouldn’t do any good just cause a mess for the nice folk here Samuel”

“What would?”

“That cute MP Shield you always keep on you, it's no good here”

“How the hell”

He held a finger up “Before you say anything I am a friend, not here for any funny business just some friendly advice”

“People don’t go all this way just to give advice”

“I do” he waved the statement away “You’ve upset a lot of people Samuel you need to watch yourself”

“That's why I’m here” Running to some backwoods town is not what I would call a good plan, and could you please put that damn thing out,” he said gesturing at my cigarette with a grimace

“Sure” I stamped it in my tray and steepled my fingers at him 

“Thank you” he sighed and pushed back his dirty blonde hair “They’re going to get you tonight”

I lowered my eyes and gestured “I can see that”

“Not clearly enough”

“Why help?” 

“No point in your death and I see it as an affront”

“Don’t see why you’d care”

“I have an interest, and you don’t need to worry” his eyes locked with mine and the cold of it sent a shiver down my spine, and I sat back “Suppose either way I don’t have much choice”

“Salvation or death Samuel?” he said in a far too regal fashion

“Don’t tell me you’re a preacher?” 

“Nothing of the sort, now do you want to live?”

“Of course”

“Then go here and I’ll collect what I’m owed when I choose” 

He passed me a piece of paper with a name and address 

“Ken?”

“He’ll keep you safe till I collect”

The man straightened his tie and stood at the same time the waitress came by with a coffee pot, and looked at the man “Do you want any dear I can grab a mug”

“No ma'am just catching up for a moment, I thank you”

“Alrighty” She looked down at my mug but I held my hand over it and smiled at her

“Goodluck Sam”

Without another word, my confidant turned around and left with a jingle of the bells as the doors swung open. He never gave me a name, just the piece of paper I now have crumpled into my flannel pocket, it's right next to a new ash burn and coffee stain. 

So if he isn’t trying to isolate me to kill me in peace, I’ll make another entry, if not this has been your dubious asset manager Samuel and karma has caught me.
