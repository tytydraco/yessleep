Let's preface this by saying I am a STEM grad student at a major university. No names will be given because I definitely don't want my name getting attached to this, not just because of my academic career, but also because of the things I found out. I have never been predisposed to paranoia, but this whole situation has me on edge.

One of my hobbies is reading about military history and the wars the US fought in. My old man is a Marine and served before I was born, so I always saw it as something personal in a way. To say I am a rule breaker is putting it mildly, hence why I decided not to join up when I graduated high school, much to his dismay. I always preferred the company of psychedelics and booze to the 5AM runs and weightlifting he so adores. Even so we have a great relationship. 

I remembered recently a story he told me about one of the old heads he served with. Guy went to Vietnam as a young Lieutenant and got involved in some of that "secret squirrel shit" as pops used to call it. He ventured into the tunnels, killed men with knives, bayonets, flamethrowers, and everything else under the sun. Dad always said he was a bit of a sociopath, but I can understand why.

The Lieutenant, well, Lieutenant Colonel by the time he left the service, always said he never was scared of anything he saw except for one thing. He would never answer my dad when asked what it was until a few years before his death after a couple rounds of whiskey at the VFW.

He said that one night they hopped in a helicopter to run some night raids on a Vietcong position, and they handed him a pair of night vision goggles, something never seen before. Back then they used to be made of red phosphor, which made everything red instead of green when looked through. He said that they started seeing... Things. The old Colonel was a southern boy, so the only way he knew how to describe them was it looked like Mothman flying towards them. The men screamed in terror and started shooting at the things they saw, leading to a friendly fire incident that left one of the men dead. The military covered the incident up and sent the surviving men back stateside immediately, all they told them at the VA was that it was a "mass hallucination due to battle stress/shellshock." Dad said he asked the old man "is that it? That's what you were so scared of?" The old man slammed his glass down and took a hit of the Marlboro Red burning between his fingers and said "fuck no, boy. The scary part was that we all saw the same exact... Things." He then went quiet and changed the conversation to the sports game playing on the TV. Dad said he saw his hands shake a little the rest of the night.

I looked into it about a week ago and read a lot of similar stories on old forums. Being a scientist I decided to... research and experiment.

I delved into the computer research systems our school provided to read research on red phosphor and night vision goggles but didn't find much, so, I decided to ask one of the septuagenarian professors who refused to retire what he knew about it, since our college was deeply involved in the good old military industrial complex during the cold war.

I walked into the old wood floored office adorned with pictures of men long since dead and models of corvettes and mustangs discontinued decades ago. I found the old man sitting at his desk feeding a long tailed betta fish which adorned the otherwise lifeless room.

"Longtime no see!" He says with a smile adorning his weathered, bearded face. "What brings the prodigal son long since departed to my humble abode?" He said with a familiar smirk on his face. "Research, my friend, research." I say with confidence. "How is grad life treating you? You still working on that thesis about psychedelics and other hippy shit?" He says with a laugh. "Very funny" I snort along with him. His sense of humor was blunt as was common for men of his age. "In a way I guess I am" I reply with more seriousness in my tone. "I wanted to know if you know anything about first generation night vision goggles?" "Do I ever!" He replied with enthusiasm I had never seen from him. "My favorite professor was a pioneer of them, God rest his soul." He says with a sad smile. "What do you want to know?"

"About the supposed hallucinations they caused." I reply in a matter of fact way. He sits up from his chair and looks at me with curiosity "how do you know about that?" He asked me with a surprised tone. "My dad was USMC, said one of the old guys he served with told him about it. I also read a couple stories on old forums. I couldn't find any info about the hallucinations on the sites we use for research or the school intranet." I reply to him a little sheepishly due to his reaction. "Man, I haven't thought of that freaky shit in years." He says taking off his glasses and rubbing his eyes in a way I never saw from him before. "My professor was involved with some weird stuff back in the old days. You ever seen Men Who Stare at Goats or that UFO stuff? He studied all of that stuff. Most of that shit got classified... but some copies made it through the cracks" He said with a mischievous grin. He stands up slowly from his desk, his old age on full display, and walks over to a locked wooden cabinet in the corner of the room. He opens the door and rummages around for a minute before he says "bingo!" and pulls out an old manilla folder. "This one is called 'Red Phosphor'" he says matter of factly with a grin. 

He fiddles with his glasses for a bit before opening the folder "back in the old days, like the middles ages, scientists were called alchemists or magicians. Most of their books were taken by the churches and burned, but a few made their way out." He says readjusting in his chair. "You have surely heard of a few of them in your studies, but there are many, many more books out their that the various governments and universities got their hands on and hid from the public. My professor got his hands on a book that had info on red phosphor from the US government in the hopes that he could recreate some of the... reactions the alchemists had recorded all those years ago." He says with a hint of trepidation in his voice. "You know Alice in Wonderland, right?" He says with curiosity in his voice. "What do you think?" I say with a wide grin. "Of course you know about it, but have you ever read it? Lewis Carroll, the writer, was the one who owned the book before the US came into possession of it." He stated. "Really?" I sit up with a renewed curiosity. "What does a children's book have to do with anything?"

"The looking glass Alice had was made of red phosphor" he states with no hint of joking. "Red Phosphor is a key to opening other worlds... at least that is what Lewis and my professor thought. Back then, the 'occult scientists' as I like to call them disguised their work to not be killed" He states plainly. "Look, Son..." he says to me with a hint of sadness in his eyes. "I am an old man and I know death will take me sooner rather than later. I promised myself I would give the research my old friend entrusted to me to people that were experts who could further his ideas. And you, son, are the man that can finish this part of his work." He says handing me the folder with a smile. "Tell no one I gave this to you." He says sternly. I thank him, shook his hand, and leave.

I took a few thousand dollars I have saved and gathered the supplies I needed for my experiments. The college pays me for my studies and I live a frugal life and had a scholarship for my undergrad so I have plenty of money saved. My supplies consisted of rare, processed, red phosphor from the last 40 years. This stuff is hard to find by the way, a stately old wooden mirror I found at a garage sell, all of Lewis Carroll's books and research, and lots of drugs. Mushrooms, marijuana, DMT, ketamine, and many, many more.

I had an idea. Some of the subjects of my thesis are lucid dream states, astral projection, remote viewing, and ego death. I combined my research with the professor's and the children's books to develop an hypothesis. If I tint the mirror with red phosphor, reflect it through a window also covered in red phosphor, and astral project myself towards the mirror and then towards the window pane, I will have pushed myself into a mirror image (fulfilling the theme of Through the Looking Glass) and can then use the window as a portal or door to another plane of existence.

But, before that, I decided to use a very old, and very expensive, pair of red night vision goggles I got off of Ebay. I placed them on my head and took a look around and I saw... Nothing. Not a single thing. I saw a cat running through the dark woods outside of my apartment but that was about it. Then I thought how can I recreate the conditions the men in Vietnam experienced? It then came to me in a flash, elevation and intoxication. Drug use was rampant in Vietnam and the old Colonel always told stories of his time smoking jungle weed. I walk to the university and climb to the roof of the oldest building, and take a hit of my pen, feeling the relief wash over me. I sit there for a few minutes thinking about how stupid I am for wasting $2000 on this stupid shit. I sigh, and put on the goggles.

The world around me... Changes drastically. The empty streets are replaced with a scene that must have been out of the middle of a horror movie. Dismembered corpses and demons devouring them. Men and women with flesh peeling off their bodies crying out in pain. Animals missing eyes and limbs and flesh.

I rip the goggles off of my head. "What the fuck even was that!?" I say grabbing for my pen and taking another puff to calm down. It is hard to explain, but when I was there, it was like an overlay of sorts. Like I could still see everything in this world, but I could also see everything there too. And this... overlay, stopped as soon as I peeled the goggles off. 

Skipping over a few other experiences I had with the glasses including a few seeing the mothman-like creatures the Colonel had described, I started writing my research paper. The creatures were similar to ones I had seen on other drugs, but they seemed more tangible here. I found though that they would attack the poor souls in this other world. they seemed to be like birds. Pecking and clawing away at everything the could. They were the size of a large dog and had needle like teeth. which if this world is like ours means they drink blood and rip flesh to survive. I saw other creatures though like snakes with the heads of grasshoppers, and cats that had the faces of chimps. 
I saw a few other beings there too. Elves that moved with long, slender limbs longer than their bodies. Other things I could only describe as the Hatman entities that would rip apart the humans and other creatures here. There were also men and women, the most stunning I have ever seen. They would smile and beckon me to follow them, but I never would. I think that this place... Has everything though. Every scary creature you read about as a kid, ever demon, every cryptid, everything was there. Every fear and phobia. Stuff I didn't even recognize. I saw kittens and puppies even, since I guess people are scared of those too? Who knows.

Reading the papers and books I hypothesized that going through the phosphor "portal" would change what I experienced. This realm is an overlay through the glasses because this is an inbetween area. Beyond this place that serves as a buffer of negative ions and energy, the two positives of our current world and the mirror world can exist. Like the conscious and subconscious exist on either side of the ego, and can be switched with enough practice. This middle place has to be what we call Hell, with the negativity absorbing all evil in the world.

Through trial and error, I developed a mix of compounds that could cause astral projection without fail. It consisted of ayahuasca and various research chemicals I sourced from the internet. I had gone too far to go back now. I drank the ayahuasca, and an hour later put the IV bag filled with the chemical blend into my arm with a small jolt of pain. Within three minutes, I was out. I had taken a powerful anti nausea drug before I began the process and put a sedative in the blend that would keep me from moving my body. 10 hours of fluid would keep me locked in.  


Then, I wake up. In a comfortable bed with a woman by my side. I knew who she was immediately. A few years older and with a new ring on her finger, I found just who I was looking for and why I started this journey to start with; my dead fiancée. Just like Lewis Carroll said, this place is the opposite of my world. I never went to college, and she never got in that damn car to visit me. I look at her and tears start streaming down my face. I walk down the hallway of this house and find our child sleeping in his bed. She was going to tell me she was pregnant the day the crash happened. I go to the living room, and I just cry my eyes out.

I wish I had never done this experiment. You know why? Because I know what all of you fuckers have that I don't. My love, my Anise. You know what I didn't tell you? You can't close this portal all the way once it is open. You imagined a face for me, a name for me. You made immortal what doesn't exist in your world. All that bullshit about being scared of the government was a lie since I plan to die when I get back anyway. By you reading this, you opened a tunnel straight to my world that goes through that negative realm. Maybe I can't get through to you, but everything else can. Lucid dreaming happens to all of us once we sleep to some extent. The things you fear will be drawn to you, negative (them) to positive (you.) So, maybe you should keep one eye open. Either way, you deserve what you get for having what I don't. 

The only thing I will find in Hell is nothing, because the only thing that I ever truly feared was losing her. What can you say?
