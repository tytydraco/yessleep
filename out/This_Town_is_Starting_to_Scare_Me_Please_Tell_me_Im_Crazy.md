I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to post this on here. I have a tendency to overthink things, so there’s honestly a good chance that this story is only scary in my head. I don’t really have anyone else to talk to about it, though, so I figured, why not? Everyone seems really helpful on here, so I thought I would just give it a shot and just see what people say. 

I (23f) just moved to a new town. I’m not gonna tell you where, obviously, but it's a small, quiet, southern town that you would miss if you blinked while driving on the highway. The only thing that even alludes to its existence is a small sign bearing the town's name. Since moving here a couple of weeks ago, I’ve started to notice some odd things about the place, and it’s started to creep me out to the point where I get scared to take the trash out. It’s just been a bunch of random things so far, but I can’t stop thinking about them.

This town is small. Painfully small. There’s only a handful of buildings that make up the downtown area, and only half of those buildings have functional businesses inside of them. All of the buildings look like they’re being held together by a thread. You’d think this town was abandoned if it weren’t for the few cars sprinkled throughout. At the end of the main street where I live is the town hall, and it’s a massive building. It towers over the surrounding buildings and has a clock that shines intensely at night. I can see it from my living room window. 

I never see anyone in those buildings. Honestly, I barely see anyone on this street at all. The only people I see are my neighbors whenever we leave our apartments for work or to take out the trash at the same time or something. I don’t see people walking up or down the street. I see no shoppers, no tourists, no bored, small-town teens looking for entertainment, or even homeless people. I hear them, though. Every day, I hear people laughing, yelling, and talking out there. Sometimes, I try to rush outside and catch them, but I always miss them. 

So far, the only two people I’ve spoken to that actually *live* here are the property manager of my building and my landlord. I’ve only ever spoken to my landlord through email or text, so the only person I’ve spoken to in person is the property manager. She’s this little old lady who likes to talk a lot. The first day we met, she went on and on about her life here, her relatives from here (both living and dead), her recently deceased dog, her medical issues, etc. I wasn’t too bothered by this because I work with a lot of old people at my job. I know they love to talk, so I just let her ramble on while I explored the apartment, occasionally disrupting her stories with simple questions. We had just wrapped up examining the living room, as well as a riveting tale about a recent scare at the urologist, when something changed.

“So, yer a long way from home, ain’t ya?”

Her voice sent a slow chill up my spine, trailing up my neck and onto the back of my skull. My scalp tightened as the chill morphed into an icy grip on my hair. My head slowly turned to face her, and I could see that her body had changed. Before, this woman was shriveled and curled and air-headed. Now, her body seemed more alert. More awake. She was standing straight up, and for the first time, she was making true, unbroken eye contact with me. 

She was fixed on me so intensely that I could almost *feel* which one of my eyes she was looking at.The chill she gave me spread, causing my knees to lock. I couldn’t tear myself from her gaze. She was looking at me too hard, like she was trying to find something in me. As I struggled to force out a response, it felt like the question was worming its way around my head- like it was trying to consume the answer before I got to it. Every limb, every organ, every *pore* on this woman was somehow fixed on me, waiting for my response. I started to choke out that I was only moving here to get closer to my new job, and that I wasn’t planning on stayi-

“Aw, that’s too bad! Lord knows we could always use more people around.”

She was quick, almost devouring my words and spitting out its remains as an answer. Just as quickly as she had ended her response, she had thrown another question at me, this one just as invasive as the last. She would continue to interrogate me like this until I finished looking around the apartment. I couldn’t even focus on the place with her questions continuing to jab and prod at me. It was only until I managed to get us both out of the apartment and back onto the street that she stopped, returning to the air-headed old woman I had first been accustomed to. She cooed that she hoped to hear more from me soon and made her way back to her car, humming along to the music. I was only able to shake off the fear and relax my joints once I had shoved myself into my car. The droning music that was blasting outside finally convinced me to drive away. 

That’s the last thing about this place. The speakers. The main street is lined with lights, and each one has an ancient looking speaker attached to it. They’re all tuned in to this local Christian radio station that plays all day and all night. They don’t all play at once, and the speaker that is actually playing the music changes throughout the day. They all play loud, though. My apartment is in the back of the building, but sometimes, if I focus hard enough, I can hear the muffled voice of the station’s host. 

I’m aware that none of this is connected and that all of this is probably just some small town bullshit, but seeing *someone*\- even if it’s just a stranger on the internet- confirm or deny it helps a ton. I’m starting to lose sleep over all of this. It feels like they’re getting louder each day, but I can’t catch them. If I manage to drown *them* out, the radio blasts from the speaker closest to me. And when the music finally moves on, and I feel like I can finally close my eyes, I see her. The look on her face. If I think about it for too long, I start to feel something wriggling inside me again. I don’t know what she wants, and I don’t know if I can even give it to her. I’m worried she’ll come back looking for it again. I barely leave the apartment now. I’m so tired. I want this to stop. I just need someone to tell me I’m being crazy. 

If you read through all of this, I appreciate it.
