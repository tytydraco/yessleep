Across almost all major religions and their multitudes of sub-groups, one thing tends to be agreed on. If the devil exists within their beliefs, his solitary goal is to lead us all to hell. To eternal damnation.

It might not be easy to believe, but he wants to give us salvation.

A few years back, I was involved in a terrible accident. I'd always been a careful cyclist through packed city streets, desolate unpaved roads and everything in between, so I still can't quite understand how I didn't see the semi-truck that sent me flying across the street coming. Countless shards of glass and an overwhelming feeling of numbness were my final memories before I closed my eyes into a comforting yet completely foreign feeling of calm. That it was over, but I'd be alright. Now I was never one for religion, but awakening to an enormously large gate stretching further than my eyes could comprehend led to a simple realisation.

This was heaven. I didn't go out of my way to make it here, but I'd made it anyway.

A voice echoed from above. No, actually, from everywhere. As if it was the voice in my own head and from somewhere else entirely all at once. "*My creation. You have lived a good life, and you will enjoy the fruits of this forevermore. You have earned salvation.*" A smile slowly made its way across my face and a sense of contentedness filled my body as I stepped through the gates into where I would end up spending a countless period of time.

I'm not quite sure when I lost track of time, but a life without sleep or any form of trackable time will do that to you. I did and saw everything I wanted to see and do. That concert I'd always wished to have seen but was born a few decades too late? Done. That piece of history I wish I could have seen in the flesh but didn't have a time machine for? Done. The place was everything a human could ever hope for or desire, yet lacked a pretty important aspect of what makes us *us. Human*.

Have you ever thought about how terrible being constantly happy would be? The best days you've ever lived, your favourite moments, the stretches of your life when things just felt right? Those things only ever felt so good because at some point you'd lived through your worst days, your worst moments and the stretches of your life when things just felt wrong.

I could live a life of utter perfection, and yet the happiness I felt was never real because there was no point of comparison. Happy became the new normal. Yet I couldn't change it. I was completely aware of the futile nature of it and remained as happy as I'd ever been regardless. It was at that point I had this realisation that my true purpose there became apparent. As if God, or whatever was in charge here, had been waiting for the shoe to drop.

The voice spoke to me again, told me that it would all be clear soon. It was right. A self-described guide, a younger man with a weathered face and a body adorned in perfectly white garments led me to an area of the place I'd never seen before. A niggling question I'd been meaning to ask came to the forefront of my mind. I'd been there for quite some time, yet I'd met at most a dozen other people like myself.

Where *was* everybody?

The rows upon rows of nothing but humans stood upon the vast expanse of nothingness he led me to answer that question. These humans didn't look happy. Not the oblivious type I was before my recent realisation nor the helpless type I was following it. I don't know what they looked like, determined maybe. Ultra-focused. Lacking the emotions you would expect from people in such a place.

"*What is this place?*" I queried with a visible look of confusion on my face.

"*Power*." he curtly replied.

Throughout the next few "days", the true purpose of the place and my role within it were revealed. The hidden corner of paradise I'd purposefully never been shown up until that point was where most of the people were for good reason. Humans who were chosen to awaken to those gates after they died were given a set period of time to enjoy the stereotypical form of heaven before they were sent to the place I'd come to learn of as the Boundless Plain. Here, as my guide succinctly put it, they were given power. A level of which no human - or higher form of life for that matter - should have. It was explained to me that time didn't exist as a concept here and as such time on Earth did not run parallel. From here, time on Earth ran all at once. From the first tetrapods to crawl onto land to the final human to draw breath, it all happened at once. This place existed outside of time and space. Each human within the Boundless Plain is - and has since the death of the first batch of humans - assigned a human living on Earth at any point in time with a single common goal. To bring about the cataclysm. God is disgusted by his creation and has been since the figure we know as the Devil was sentenced to roam the Earth. His wish is to bring about human suffering and those in Heaven are not exempt from this. His wish is to start over. A clean slate. An uncorrupted species.

You might wonder why certain events in both our history and present happen the way they do. It's a common point of diversion between theists and non-theists. Why would God allow so much suffering? Why would innocent people be subjected to such constant depravity? You may not like the answer, but it's all orchestrated. Exactly the way He wants. The humans in the Boundless Plain work towards this goal by gently nudging their assigned human away from morality, from good. You might be surprised how little encouragement it takes for the average human to give into a little voice in their head leading them astray. You might be surprised that the sick thoughts we all have from time to time aren't actually your doing. That voice in your head telling you to jump when you're somewhere high up? Blame the Boundless Plain. That voice in your head trying to convince you to pocket the $100 you found on the sidewalk? Blame the Boundless Plain. The effect this has on the average human was never designed to be overwhelming, but on a larger scale in terms of numbers and in terms of those who are not average humans in the sense of the power structure, the combined effect has been and will be devastating. Now, this isn't to say immorality isn't a trait inherent to some humans nor is it to say all humans need the same level of encouragement towards evil but this is to say evil is not born, but created. Artificially. Not through environment nor through genetics but through immense power held in hands never designed to wield it.

The Cataclysm refers to an event that takes place in the near future for those of you reading this. The human I was assigned lives to witness this, as will many of you. As I mentioned earlier, the designed effect increases when you consider living humans with a higher level of power. Celebrities. Monarchs. Politicians. In 2032, politicians worldwide are pushed into a series of escalating confrontations. Words lead to shots, shots lead to bombs and bombs lead to annihilation. Worldwide nuclear catastrophe. Not a continent nor a corner of the Earth is left untouched. Within decades, the final human takes their last breath and our planet is returned to nature. His plan is complete.

And He starts over.

Within a few days of the horrific revelation, the Plain began to change. The shade of white painting the endless void around me shifted and sounds began to ring out from where they previously hadn't.

*Beep.*

*Beep.*

*Beep.*

The smell of sterilised nothingness washed over me.

My recovery, if you can call it that, was long and hard, and even months later the ability to walk hasn't returned to me. I remain in the intensive care unit. But I didn't care. The life I lived in the 7 minutes I had been clinically dead remained at the forefront of my mind. I wondered if the humans I'd come across in the Plain were given the chance to live a "normal" life in paradise as I had been given. My instinct told me they hadn't. The previously singular voice in my head had splintered into two.

One tried to convince me to give in. To stop fighting my body and simply die. To be with *Him*.

The other screamed at me, told me to fight. To stay. That maybe I could change things now that I knew the truth. That I could end up somewhere that wasn't there.

Many believe Hell to be the absence of God.

*Please*, choose the absence.
