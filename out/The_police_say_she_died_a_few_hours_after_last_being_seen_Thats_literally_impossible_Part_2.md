Hello everyone, recently two more women were found under the same conditions as Sue. 

Yesterday, police found Kelly. She was camping with her boyfriend Ben. After finishing a card game late at night, she told him that she needed to go to the bathroom. She left the tent to go down to the porta potty a short walk away and he went to bed. That was the last time he saw her. He went back to sleep, awaking in the morning to her being gone. Ben thought she had already woken up and was outside. However, when he went outside, she was nowhere to be found. 

He frantically called 911 and searched the camp site. By late afternoon, they found her body 5 miles (8 kilometer) away from the tent. Like me, he was part of the party which found her. 

Officially, the cause of death for both my friend and Kelly was hypothermia, each having died a few hours after last being seen. 

I reached out to Ben over Facebook to say that my friend also died yesterday in the same woods and hopefully give him some comfort. Part way through the conversation, he messaged me. A portion of our conversation:

Him: ”Can I tell you something odd? She was chopping up bacon when the knife slipped and she cut herself. I saw the cut, because I was with her when it happened. It was a nasty cut, so deep that I could see the bone. Yet when I found her, there was no bandage. There was no wound. There was only a scare where the cut had been."

Me: “oh my god. My friend had shaven her legs less than 12 hours after being found. When I found her, her leg hair had grown back completely. Like an inch long. I though maybe it was a case of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, but then I remembered she had gotten tested for it and the test came back negative. 

Him: “what the fuck”

Me: “I know right?”

\[…\]

Me: “The last thing my friend texted me was the word ‘snow.’”

Him: “When I was searching for Kelly, I found a word make my twigs on the ground: snow. 

The other woman is Ruby, who was found dead in the same forest today. A cause of death was just released: hypothermia. 

For a time line: 

December 9th, Sue dies and is found later that day

December 10th, Kelly goes missing and is found later that day

December 11th, Ruby disappears and is found later that day. 

Think that’s crazy? Wait till you hear this: I was going through the Facebook comments made after her disappearance dedicated to finding her, one of which was from a hair stylist posted about an hour before she was found. She claimed that a women who looked exactly like Ruby had come in around 4 pm. The stylist had cut her hair which had reached down to her mid back into shoulder length. 

But before police could speak with her, Ruby had been found.

Rubies hair was described as being down to her mid back. 

Whoever the woman was, she had paid in cash, and the security camera was too grainy to tell if it was her or not. 

Oh, it gets crazier. Around noon, the stylist had posted a photo of someone who had vandalized the window of her shop with spray paint.

The vandalism was of a single word: snow.

I just messaged Ben a few minutes ago, and he said that he hasn’t told anyone else about the word.

What the fuck is going on here? I’m not a conspiracy theorist but I don’t understand what is happening. 

Yet no one else seems to be worried except me and Ben. Not even our own family and friends think anything is suspicious. 

Sallys mom to the town newspaper: “The bar was right near the woods, and the bar owns a few acres and has bond fires during the night. Sally would sometimes go a dusk, but never when it was dark out. Sally unfortunately just got lost.”

Kellys father on Facebook: “Kelly had gone to the forest many time, but never during the night. It was pitch black and she lost her way back to camp.”

Ruby's brother to the local tv station: “Ruby often went for a jog in those woods in the afternoon. She stayed out too long at became lost.” 

Three women in three days had died in the same forest. Each had someone claiming that the woman or someone who looked like her had a distinct feature which had been changed less than 24 hours after being reported and found, yet the feature was back as it was prior to disappearing. All three people who had either last seen them or thought they had last seen them found the same cryptic message. Everyone had known their way to their destination, but had never walked at night. 

To make matters worse, I’m getting the sense that I’m being followed. Ben feels the same. When he looked out his window, he saw a black SUV drive past. An hour later, he again saw a black SUV, this time parted outside across the street. He stared at the car for a few moments through the curtains before going outside to see what was going on. But when he opened the door, the van drove away. 

I have had a similar experience. I also noticed a black SUV parked outside my apartment, but drove away when I opened the door. 

I live on the edge of the woods. It literally starts 10 meters from the back of the apartment. I don’t feel safe in my apartment anymore. I don’t feel safe anywhere near those woods, even if the deaths have only happened in the woods. What if whatever is in there spreads out? 

Right now, I am sitting in a cafe using their wifi. I already am set up for an undisclosed location. With Google it is easy to find out peoples addresses, and the killer probably knows where Sue lives know that they know who she was. 

Why aren’t people worried?

Who is following Ben and I, and why? 

But most of all, what really happened to those three women?
