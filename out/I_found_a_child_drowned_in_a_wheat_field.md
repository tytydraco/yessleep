The man smiled, reaching once more for the bottle in front of him. He raised it to his lips, taking a long swig and wiping the foam from the corners of his unkempt mustache before turning once more to me. After half an hour of conversation, it appeared as though something I’d said to the man had finally stirred up some interest.

“You mentioned a ‘theophany’. What’s that?” the gruff man asked. 

I reached down to his travel bag and wiped the still-fresh dust from its buckles before pulling out a bible. “Yes sir, a theophany. It’s not a word strictly associated with Jesus, but we mostly use it to describe times in the Old Testament when it’s believed the Lord appeared in a physical form, before he was born in Bethlehem. Are you familiar with the story of Jacob, how he wrestled with God?”

The man took another sip from his rapidly emptying bottle, nodding wordlessly as he did so.

“Well, that’s a Theophany. We know he struggled with a man until morning, when the man revealed himself to be the Lord. Or, an Angel of the Lord, anyhow. A lotta scholars believe that mentions  of ‘The’ Angel of the Lord are Jesus himself anyways. Whaddaya think?”

I studied his expression for any sign of interest. I had visited towns where hardly a soul could tell the difference between Moses and Noah, but had never yet met a man like the bulky, haggard figure beside me who already seemed not only immensely knowledgeable of scripture, but wholly uninterested. The man shifted in his chair, scratching his roughened chin before calling the bartender over for another beer. After several moments of silence, he spoke once again to me.

“The original language refers to the man as ‘Elohim’, which many translate to mean ‘Big G’ God. Elohim really just means ‘a god’, a heavenly being. I think it was an angel he wrestled with. Not that that ain’t impressive, mind you.” The man took another sip of beer. “What about that the burning bush?”

I raised an eyebrow. “What about it?”

“Well, just a thought, I guess. I met someone a few years back, real smart fella. He told me he believed that when Moses spoke to God through the burning bush, he was talking to Jesus. Same thing when God comforted Elijah on the mountain, that it was Jesus.”

“Well, in a way, yes. We hold Jesus and the Father to be two distinct persons, but both the same God.”

The man chuckled. “No, I mean like… like they were speaking to Christ himself, after he was born. When Jesus went up on the mountain for the transfiguration, Moses and Elijah appeared with him and they talked to him, right? He thought, maybe, since God is bigger than time, he could be both then and now all at once. His idea was that when they appear in the New Testament, it’s the same conversation that he’s having with each of them back in the Old Testament too.”

I furrowed my brow, leaning back into my chair. “That’s, um… well, that’s a unique thought. I don’t know how much water it holds scripturally, but I must say it’s creative, at least.”

The two of us sat in silence for a while, content not to trouble each other any longer with speculation or trivia. It was late into the evening then, and more weary patrons had begun to stumble into the small bar, tired from a long day’s labor. 

Not long after the last beams of orange sunlight slipped through the shuttered blinds, a small commotion began outside. I heard shouting and the screech of tires, and after a few seconds, the wooden front door burst open with a clatter. A man, disheveled and sweating, took a second to lean against the doorframe. His face was red and glistening, and he was deeply out of breath. After collecting himself, he looked across the room towards two elderly police officers who had been hunched playing cards at a small table. I recognized the elder of the two to be the Sheriff, a man named Emerson with whom I’d made acquaintance that afternoon. The red-faced man at the entrance called out to the Sheriff and his deputy, the distinct twang of panic caught between his haggard breaths.

“They found him, Sheriff. The McBride boy, they found him out in the field!”

The Sheriff had already begun to put on his coat, moving quickly towards the exit. I sat in my seat, watching the situation unfold for several moments before realizing that every other person in the small room was also rushing out the door. I turned my head to my burly drinking partner, expecting in him the same urgency, but found instead that the man moved slowly. Beneath his rough skin and unkempt beard, his expression was grim as he paid his tab and trudged out the door in pursuit of the curious mob.

I collected my things once more into my dusty travel bag and left the bar, stepping out into the dim moonlight. I looked out across the highway, where the amassing crowd was already tearing through the wheat fields in a frenzy, flashlights in hand as their red-faced messenger led them onwards.

Penuel Crossing was incredibly small back then. The township was entirely bisected by its defining interstate highway from which it clung to tightly. Across the highway to the west, where I now faced, were the majority of the local farms. When I had rode into town on the Greyhound Bus that morning, I thought that in the blistering sunlight, the fields of wheat and corn seemed infinite in their breadth, stretching out into nothingness. 

On the eastern side, the small collection of stores, bars, and municipal buildings arranged themselves as almost a perfect row along the side of the highway. Behind them lay several houses and a few small livestock farms, clustered closely to the rest of the infrastructure. Nested neatly in the middle of it all was a small chapel, once well-cared for. Those days were evidently long since passed, its white paint chipping and its windows cracked and dusted. It had been the decline of this church culminating with the sudden death of the former pastor, that had led to me being sent to Penuel Crossing that very day as the replacement pastor. 

I spotted the large man slowly making his way across the highway. I hastened my step to catch up, and between panting breaths asked him if he knew the McBride family very well.

“I didn’t, no. I’m ’bout as new around here as you are, just passing through.”

“Oh! That explains why you’re so well-learned on The Word, I reckon there ain’t a seminary ‘round here for five hundred miles. Pardon me, by the way, I never caught your name? My name is Peter.”

“Never went to preachin’ school, Peter. You can call me Nolan.”

The pair of us crossed the threshold of the wheat fields, the waist-high stalks of grain trampled under the feet of the crowd preceding us. In the ever-spreading carpet of amber ahead, all sound was muffled amidst the rhythmic rustling of the harvest in the wind. We continued in silence, following the faint lights quickly disappearing ahead further into the fields. Only when the distant wailing of a woman far ahead came to our ears did we quicken our step.

When we caught up to the rest, they were clustered frantically around chaotic scene. Ahead, just a few feet, was a large green tractor. It rested at an odd angle, slanted dramatically as though on uneven ground. I looked at its base to find that its back tires lay nearly half-submerged in the soil. Oddly, the ground on which it sat lay dry and undisturbed, as though the tires had simply sunken through the solid ground. Its operator, a panicked young man, sat leaning against its dusted metal frame, tears rolling down his tanned face as he spoke between sobbing breaths to the sheriff. 

I turned my attention away from the tractor to try to see what the crowd circled around. Several men stooped down, struggling to lift the crying woman to her feet. She kept shrugging their arms off, falling back to the ground where she herself seemed to be struggling to pull something out of the soil. As I stepped closer, gently pushing my way through the crowd, I saw the cause of distress; the lifeless body of the McBride child. 

At initial glance, it appeared as though only the upper half of the boy’s body was present. I wondered, with sickening fear, if perhaps the boy had been run over by the tractor. I observed as the woman, whom I would soon learn to be the boy’s mother, once again grabbed the child’s small arm, trying to lift him up. The realization came that the boy’s body, much like the sunken tires of the tractor, was half buried in the soil, with arms and head outstretched as though he had attempted to claw his way out of the dirt. 

When Mrs. McBride was finally pulled away from her child, Nolan began instructing some of the others to start digging out the boy’s body. The red-faced man who had burst into the bar stepped back, eyeing Nolan with curiosity and suspicion before turning to speak to the Sheriff. I watched in awe as the boy’s body was quickly removed, the soil around his legs collapsing back in on itself as though he had simply displaced the earth. Sheriff Emerson walked up beside me, letting out a heavy sigh as the pair watched. 

“I hope you’ll forgive the chaos ‘round here, reverend.”

My eyes didn’t leave the unfolding scene, watching as the boy’s mother swooped in to cradle her son’s body. “What did the farmhand say? How’d this happen?”

“Poor kid got stuck. Hopped out to take a look and tripped over the boy. Helluva thing to find. He’ll be alright in a few days, though.”

As Mrs. McBride clung to her child, she hugged his limp body tight, squeezing him. As she did, a sputter of water was pushed out of the boy’s lungs, spilling onto the ground. The crowd stepped back in shock as the mother sobbed ever louder. As the last of the water dripped out of the boy’s pale lips, my nose curled. In the air, just for a passing moment, a harsh, chemical scent wafted by. It passed nearly as soon as it arrived.

Nolan stepped back from the scene, dusting his rough hands off on his coat. I looked at him, and saw inklings of teardrops forming in the creased corners of his eyes. Nolan mouthed something to himself in disbelief, before turning to me and saying it aloud.

“He drowned.”

-

The boy’s funeral was quiet, even for such a little town. I sat silent in the back row, daring not to interrupt the already painfully awkward service. The child had been the youngest of six. His siblings and mother sat in the front row, their sniffling echoing through the near empty chapel while their Father gave a poorly rehearsed eulogy. 

I, now technically Penuel Crossing’s spiritual leader, had offered to perform the funeral myself. I had been gently declined by the McBride family, who felt the service should be performed by those who had known Benjamin in life, not only in death. Although understanding, I couldn’t help but feel the slight sting of rejection from the members of my new congregation. I hoped that these people would soon come to trust me, even amidst the tragedy I emerged into. 

Within twenty minutes the service was over and the small body was removed to be driven to the burial site, which I also declined to attend to respect the privacy of the mourners. Once the small crowd had tearfully shuffled out, I walked out of the chapel, and prayed silently that my next time attending my new place of work would not be another funeral.

I crossed the side road, walking over to the dilapidated motel next door to the bar, in which I’d stayed the last few nights and would likely keep staying in until a more permanent residence was made available. Standing outside the bar were Nolan, Sheriff Emerson, and the red-faced man from the bar. The three of them seemed to be deep in a heated discussion, one that I could tell was only intensifying as he made his approach. 

“I’m sure you had nothing to do with this Nolan, but you know the bind I’m in. We try to welcome newcomers like yourself here, but if Clark here saw you out in the fields the night the kid was found, I at least have to bring you in for some questions.”

Nolan crossed his arms firmly, leaning against the wall as I approached. “I understand that, Emerson, but we can do that right here. As I understand it, you and the deputy are the only officers in town anyways, so what good would it do to bring me into the station? I’ll answer any questions you have right here.”

The red-faced man, Clark, scoffed and turned to protest to the sheriff but was interrupted by me. 

“‘Scuse me for interrupting y’all, but am I understanding there’s some suspicion in the death? I can vouch for Nolan the afternoon the body was found, at least. We were in the bar speaking that evening, and before that he’d been sitting at the bar since ‘bout noon.”

Clark turned to me, his brow furrowed in frustration. “He might’ve been, but I saw him out in those fields the night before that, when the kid went missing. He was just standing out there, a little bit past where the body was found!”

I looked over to Nolan, who scoffed. “I weren’t nowhere near there, sheriff. I can’t prove it to you, but maybe you should start asking Clark why he was also out in the fields when the kid went missing, and why he didn’t bring it up until now?”

Clark slammed a shaking fist against the wall where Nolan leaned. “Because I, unlike you, live here and work these fields like everyone else. It’s my livelihood. You, on the other hand, have barely left the bar since you showed up, except to stand out there in the field the night he went missing!”

Sheriff Emerson pulled Clark back away Nolan. “You quit that, and calm yourself down! Mister Carver does bring up a good point, Clark; If you saw him out there that night, why didn’t you say anything?”

“It ain’t a crime to stand out there, I thought he was a new farmhand. It wasn’t until I found out later that he weren’t, and that that’s where the kid was. Had no reason to be suspicious until body was found, sheriff. I’m telling you, this man’s as guilty as sin!”

I sat back, daring not to interrupt once more as the three men continued to argue. Eventually, after some heavy persuasion and the threat of arrest, Nolan agreed to accompany the elderly sheriff back to the station provided Clark did not come with. This left a visibly angry Clark alone with me feeling extraordinarily awkward and out of place in the situation. 

The two of us sat in a tense quiet for several minutes, leaning against the wooden walls of the old bar and watching the amber fields sway in the wind across the highway. Finally, I spoke up.

“Clark, was it? I don’t think we’ve been officially introduced yet. Name’s Peter, I’m the new preacher.”

“I know who you are.” Clark chuckled between gritted teeth. “Ain’t no one been here dressed like you since Reverend John died back in May.”

“Ah. Well- I’m sorry to have come in the middle of such a troubling time. The death of a child, especially in the way it went, ain’t ever easy.”

Clark’s expression softened a bit. “‘S’allright, Peter. It ain’t nothing new ‘round here, if I’m  honest. Shit happens all the time. Livestock dies, folks die, kids die too. Just the way it goes, I guess.”

I raised an eyebrow, turning to face him. “This happens often?”

Clark stiffened, looking uncomfortable. “Well, it’s not always that bad, but yeah. Folks out here are pretty used to losing people, and not always getting the answers they’re wanting. Your buddy though, Nolan; he’s hiding something. Maybe not that he’s a killer, but something. If that something could get the McBride family some of the answers they’re hurting for, good.”

I sat back, thinking for a moment. “I wouldn’t call him my ‘buddy’, y’know. I met the man just a few days ago.”

Clark turned, stepping away from the wall and walking into the bar. “Well, then maybe you should be a bit more careful who you vouch for.”

-

The next few days were well-spent trying to restore the small chapel to some resemblance of a holy place. It was difficult to believe that the decay had crept in so rapidly in the short few months since Reverend John’s death. Likely, the paint had been peeling for years, the dust collecting in corners unswept for far too long. I made my best effort to clean every nook and cranny I could get to in the sanctuary before I would bother trying to find the lost key to the back office- it was the sanctuary, after all, where I’d hoped to reunite the congregation of Penuel Crossing in worship. I dusted the window sills, straightened the hymnals in the backs of the pews, and swapped broken lightbulbs for new ones. By Friday, the small room was finally in a state that I considered worthy of its purpose. 

By happenstance, a visitor came to the chapel that same evening. The woman, dressed in a pale blue dress and holding a toddler to her hip, walked through the door while I was collecting my personal effects to begin settling into the back office. I stood up to meet her, holding an outstretched hand to shake her own.

The woman looked apprehensively at my hand for a moment, as though debating whether to shake it or not. She shook her head as though clearing some unwanted thought before relinquishing a small smile and introducing herself. 

“You must be Peter, I’m sorry we haven’t had the chance to be introduced yet. I’m Ellen, and this is my son Micah.”

I smiled back. “It’s a pleasure to meet you both ma’am. I’m just getting things ready for the Sunday service. I wish I’d had the time to clean it up more before the funeral, but in the state it was in….” I trailed off, noticing a visual discomfort growing in Ellen’s face.

“I’m sorry, I’m sure you don’t want to hear about the mess or the funeral. What brings you in here today?”

Her creased cheeks softened once more, and she used her free hand to fish a set of keys out of her handbag. “I take it you haven’t opened the back office yet, but you’ll need these to get in, it’ll still be locked. I forgot Emerson had them.”

I hesitantly took the rusted key ring from her hand. “Well, uh, thank you miss. If you don’t mind me asking, why’d Emerson have them?”

Her face scrunched with confusion. “Because of the crime scene?”

“Crime scene? What crime scene?”

Her eyes went wide. “No one… no one told you?”

She reached out her arm, indicating she wanted the keys. I handed them back, and followed her as she led him into the short corridor behind the pulpit leading to the preacher’s office. She set Micah down on the warped wooden floor for a moment while she fidgeted with the key, struggling to fit it into the rusted keyhole. Finally, as the lock clicked open, she picked up her son once more. 

“I don’t… I don’t want to go back in there. I’m so sorry they didn’t tell you yet. I’m sure Emerson can help you clean up if anything… if there’s still some mess left. Goodbye, pastor.”

With another uncomfortable smile, Ellen left the small chapel, leaving me with the keys and the burning fusion of curiosity and terror for what I’d find on the other side. 

After a short prayer, I pulled open the creaking door, met by torn police tape hastily strewn across the threshold. As I ducked underneath, the strong smell of iron stung his nose. I looked around at the cluttered office, and was taken aback by the sight before me.

By all accounts, most of the room was as one would expect for a small town pastor. Dusted bookshelves lined the walls, completely filled with all manor of different biblical translations and theological texts. A desk stood in the center of the room, still cluttered with planners, papers, and pens. In the middle of the room, however, was evidently the crime scene that Ellen had spoken about. A crater had formed in the middle of the floorboards, a hole of warped and charred wood as though something had ruptured from beneath the floor. Shards of wood littered the whole of the office, many of which burnt and splintered, some even lodged into the ceiling above. Caked onto the front of the desk, floor, and ceiling alike near the center of the room, was a substantial splattering of dried blood.

I stepped around the hole, my puzzled mind racing for any explanation. The only one I could muster, the one that I feared the most, lodged itself firmly in my brain as I made my way around the back side of the desk; an attack, a small-scale bombing directed at the previous pastor. I allowed himself one minor sin and swore under my breath, cursing my superiors for intentionally keeping these details from me so as not to scare me away from the position.

As I looked over pastor John’s desk, I scanned the various documents. Many of them were obituaries, invitations to funerals from months prior. Clark had been right, it seemed death was a common happening in Penuel Crossing. I had been looking at the documents for several minutes before the picture on the desk caught my eye. The small framed photo, placed at the corner of the desk, seemed to be a photo of Pastor John, with his family. Clinging to his leg was a small toddler and at his other side was a loving wife, both of whom I recognized. I swore once more, frustrated at myself for not realizing earlier that Ellen and Micah were Pastor John’s wife and son.
