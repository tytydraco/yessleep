There's nothing particularly special about my life, I'm just an average man. If anything I feel less than average. I work, eat, come home, and then sleep. I have got no wife who greets me at the door and no children to pass on my name. I could even say I feel miserable some days. Well, there's not much I can do about it. When my time comes, I'll be much happy.

For some reason, I never grew out of my fear of the darkness, even as a middle aged man, I still shiver when stepping outside in the dark especially after returning home from work when it's late. It sucks cause I wish I had a companion, someone who would ease my nerves and you know.. worry about me if anything were to happen.

I was driving home from work one night, and while I usually play the radio, today I didn't. My boss had gotten on to me for a simple mistake and made me feel like shit over it. He was a prick, and while I know I have my pride as a man, I couldn't help but feel so emasculated. I didn't feel like listening to tunes, I didn't feel like listening to him, or anyone. I just wanted nothing to exist for a moment. And so while driving, it was silent, and the space around me, turned muted. And that thing .. I looked to my side and it spawned.. a fuzzy black figure that blends in with the darkness, invisible almost but still distinct enough to the human eye to recognize a shape despite seeing through its being. It felt like it had mimicked the shape of what was a poorly disfigured anorexic human being, if you can even call it that.

My eyes widened. I suddenly felt short of breath. I thought I must be hallucinating, I slowly glanced over to my passenger side again and there it was, still staring straight back at me with the same widened eye look I gave it.

"It's just a hallucination. It's just a hallucination." I kept repeating to myself to ease my nerves. Of course it was, I had always had an innate fear of the dark so my brain created something out of my anxiety. For what I could tell it's not like it did anything to me. So, when I got home, I got out the car as quickly as I could and ran to my room, forgetting about dinner. I laid on my bed, with the covers thrown completely over my head, closed my eyes tightly and started giving myself quick breaths, hoping that thing would go away. I kept singing songs in my head, counting sheep, attempting to think of boring things in order to force my brain to fall asleep but it couldn't, all it could think about was "it".

For what felt like an eternity, my alarm finally rang to wake me up, it must've been the morning now, surely it's gone as this thing can only exist in the dark. And sure enough, it was gone. I slept in that day and ended up missing work. When I woke up, it was 9pm, and that thing was staring right at me. It was hovering on top of me with the same wide eye look I just gave it. Chills ran through my entire body, my body was screaming to do something, but I was frozen in fear. Suddenly the silence I had wanted last night was eating me alive, I wished to hear anything resembling noise.. whether a creak or a tap, anything to make me flinch away from this creature.

And my wish came true. Suddenly, i heard distinct creaks on the floorboard, screeching thinly with light footsteps. It was in this moment that I really wished I had someone, anyone with me, cause I felt my final moments were near, and as I had thought previously that death would be a happy ending for me, I now feared it more than anything.

The door slowly creaked open, tears silently ran down my face as I was still frozen in fear, still looking at the shadowing monster hovering above me, too scared to divert my eyes and then --. ...----.-.-.-.-.-----.----.--.     ..-.-.-.-.-.--------.--.---.--

"And that kids is why you should never go outside in the dark alone or else a monster will eat you," said a woman with a gruff voice.

A little kid, terrified solid, started wailing, "Mommy please tell me this isn't a real story!"

The mom, feeling suddenly bad for her young ones, says "Of course it's not real, but you should still be careful. But yes darlings, people can not disappear out of thin air like that, and even if they did, someone would find them! So be cautious, but do not be afraid!"

She hugs her children. She loved all 3 of them dearly. Wait, 3 children...? Her mind had misled her for a moment, she only had two children, just the two she's only ever known. There is nothing or no one else that could've existed outside of those two, that is the whole truth.
