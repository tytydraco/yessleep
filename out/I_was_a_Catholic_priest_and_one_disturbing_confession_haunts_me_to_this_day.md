Before you say it, there’s no risk of excommunication for breaking the sacramental seal. I left the church of my own volition in 2013, so I will gladly reveal this unholy confession to you.

Besides, I answer first to God, and this sinner was no child of Him.

The greatest fright of my life began twelve years ago when an unassuming note was delivered to the rectory.

*Tonight. 7pm. Wait in your confessional. Do not come out. Do not look at me*.

In retrospect, something was very off about that, but this wasn’t the first time a guilty soul had concealed his or her identity before confessing. Usually, however, penitents would perhaps don a shawl or tinted glasses. This was new.

*He must be unbelievably riddled with shame*, I decided, though I did not judge.

After all, I still innocently believed I’d heard every crime before: adultery, abuse, and even murder; from a convict who had already served his time but sought to repent, so I granted him that. I have granted absolution to the greatest of sinners.

But not this man.

At seven o’clock, I sat and waited in my confessional; a shambly wooden booth with a rotting latticed divider, affording no pretence of discretion or separation between the priest and penitent during the sacrament of penance. Donations from my fellow Irishmen and Irishwomen had kept the lights on, but the church was falling into disrepair.

Nevertheless, red drapes shielded the booth doorways. As I listened to the mystery note-deliverer stride up the aisle, I hoped he would be appreciative for those curtains veiling his approach from my gaze.

*Wait in your confessional. Do not come out. Do not look at me*.

I was respecting his wishes.

Was not questioning them nearly as much as would have been apposite.

The man opened his curtain, and I kept my eyes down. I glimpsed only the outline of a figure in the light of the church before he drew shut the red fabric behind him. Darkness returned; not that the candles had provided much illumination anyway, and night had fallen beyond the stained glass windows.

“Good evening, Father,” said the man.

“Good evening, my child,” I replied.

“Are you looking away?”

“Yes, my child. What brings you here today?”

“Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession.”

If I’d been a cynical man back then, I would have paid greater attention to the derision and lack of sincerity in his voice.

“If you feel able, confess.”

The man exhaled deeply. “I have hurt those who have sinned, Father. And that is *my* sin.”

There followed a pause, so I pressed. “Are you comfortable to tell me more?”

“I am very comfortable, Father. Are you?”

Now there was more than derision in his voice; there was a bladed edge, which left my arms tingling, and brought about my first twinge of fear.

“Do not worry about me, my child,” I said. “I am here not to judge, but to absolve you. Please, if you feel able, continue.”

“Oh, that’s so grand of you, Father!” There was the sardonic tone again. “Well, you see, my sin is that I’m not like you, holy man. I don’t seek sinners to absolve them, and I don’t hurt ‘em as some sort of retributive justice. No, I’m a *taker*, Father. I eat shame. Heavens, does it taste good. Don’t you think so?”

He was clearly an unwell man, but not the first to have entered my booth.

“I think… I think you have done the right thing by coming here today. I would like to pray for you. O my God, help your child—”

“I’m not his child,” said the man coldly.

There it was again: that extraearthly blade slashing my arms. Only, this time it felt like more than a psychological phenomenon. I examined my skin frantically, but found no marks. Found no knife working through me.

None of this was right.

For the first time in my life, I did not feel God’s presence in that church.

“In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit…” I eventually continued, voice fragile as I wrestled with the wrongness of the man on the other side of my booth, “With God’s grace, I pray you find penance, absolution, and a life without sin. Amen.”

“But I don’t want absolution, Father. I’m confessing for the craic of it, don’t y’know? Most of all, I don’t want to stop hurting sinners. Sinners like *you*.”

That unseen knife tore into me again, and I looked down a second time.

That twinge of fear blossomed into terror, the likes of which I have never felt before. Terror so paralysing that I managed not even a whimper.

The blade was not imaginary.

A growing pool of blood stained the inner sleeves of my black cassock, and I rolled them up to reveal gashes running the length of my forearms; gashes *still being cut* by that spectral weaponry. I had long believed in miracles, but *this*? This was an abomination.

The man cried out with laughter. “O absolution! I feel it in me bones. Grand, so it is. Thanks be to God! Here, what about *you*, Father? Have *you* confessed?”

That question cut nearly as sharp at the blade, and I ignored it. Clawing at my bleeding arms, as fresh wounds were forged by that invisible blade, I fell to my knees and considered lifting my head to look up at the lattices. Considered looking at the—

“I wouldn’t be doing that if I were you, Father,” warned the man, blessed or cursed with psychic perception.

“What are you? The Devil?”

“No Devil here, Father. No God. Nothing and no-one to absolve you. I told you; that’s not what I do.”

“Then what do you do?”

“*I EAT SHAME!”* he growled. “Now confess, or I shall make things so much more terrible for you.”

Lifting my bloody hands to cover my eyes, I gave the man what he wanted.

“Bless me, o my God, for I have sinned…” I began. “I was eight years old. Riona was my first love, but she liked Finley, not me. I knew as much when he broke his arm and she drew a love heart on his plaster cast. I was envious, so I spread a rumour that Riona had kissed Finley behind the bicycle shed. Gossip was a dangerous thing in my small village. She and her family had to move away because folk started treating ‘em cruelly. They called her the worst things—”

“Little hure,” the man said. “An’ Finley was *the hure fucker*.”

*How do you know that?* This penitent wasn’t some former classmate of mine. I knew that from the wounds supernaturally inflicted on my arms.

I whispered, “Who are you?”

“Ask me that once more, Father, and I’ll pull back that red curtain to show you. But y’won’t like that. Trust me. It’s for your sake… Finish the story.”

I blubbered. “I always blamed Connor and Seán for what came next. They said Finley needed to be put in his place for ‘taking your girl’. Not that she’d ever been mine. Connor told Finley it was a shame his arm had healed because ‘injuries win the girls’. So my two friends took their penknives and started cutting into both his arms. Cutting, and cutting, and cutting whilst he begged for them to stop.”

“And what did you do, Father?”

I was becoming too light-headed to speak, or even cry. “I absolved myself of blame. I wasn’t holding the knife, after all. But I still… let them do what they did… and maybe even enjoyed it… because I hated Finley. *That’s* my greatest sin.”

At long last, the gashing of my flesh ceased. I would have leapt for joy, but I was too weak. Too close to losing consciousness. *Despite all that, I think I’m going to die anyway*, I lamented.

The man laughed. “Your sin, and guilt, drove you to become a holy man, didn’t it? Look at you, Father: a sinner cleansing sinners.”

“We… We are all sinners.”

“I absolve thee, sinner,” the man mocked. “I’ll be leaving now. Blessed be *you*, Father, for tonight’s meal. Your guilt. Your delectable disgrace. It was divine… Now, I pray you tend to your wounds quickly, should the Lord see fit.”

I heard his curtain draw back as I lay in a foetal position, eyeing the bottom of my own red curtain. A slither of light was visible at one side, cut off momentarily by a shade cast from the figure exiting the booth. I was tempted once more to peek.

“No,” the man advised. “Farewell.”

As he walked away, all seemed safe. I fumbled for the phone in my trouser pocket, below the cassock, to call an ambulance. But there was one final statement. One final terror.
