When It was my birthday, and I turned 5 ! My uncle Scott gave me a strange doll. He told me that this is a magical doll! One that only I could hear talking to me.

I thought that it was stupid. Because none of my other dolls could talk. But then after the party and when my mother tucked me into bed.

The doll finally spoke. The doll asked me “are you awake lily”? I asked ‘how do you know my name’? The doll said “I know all the little girls name’s lily”!

I ran out of my bed room! and told my mom ‘my doll talked to me mommy’! My mother walked into my bedroom still tired.

And I told my doll ‘say hi to mommy’! but the doll did not speak! My mother went back to bed not believing me.

Then my doll said “sorry lily but your mother can’t hear us”! I then ask ‘why can’t she’? My doll then said “because if she knew I could speak I will lose my magic”!

I then told the doll ‘I’m sorry’. My doll’s said “it’s fine lily you didn’t know”! And I then went to bed. as my doll’s glowing eyes watched me!

The next day my doll said “do you want to hear a secret”? I asked my doll ‘yes what is it’? My doll told me that she had a name!

I asked the doll ‘what’s your name’? my doll told me “my name is Abby”! I said ‘that is a great name’! Abby said “now you tell me a secret”

I asked Abby why? Abby said “Because when I tell you a secret you tell me a secret”! So I told her  ‘my mom once forgot me at a gas station once’

And that for some reason got Abby hooked! And over the following weeks me and Abby would tell secrets to each other. Like Abby told me she’s seen other little girls! I would tell her that I once stole a cookie from the cookie jar.

But none of my other secrets really were interesting to Abby. Which i couldn’t understand why at the time!

Then one night! after my mother tucked me into bed. Abby asked “are you awake lily”? I said ‘yes it’s hard to sleep with your glowing eyes’.

Abby said “lily for being the nicest girl I’ve ever met, I have a surprise for you”! I said excitedly ‘what is it’? Abby said “it’s what ever you want it to be, you just got to tell me”!

I told ‘Abby can it be a new bike’? abby said “yes it can be a new bike”! just go to your backyard”! And after Abby said that. I jumped out of bed! And walked downstairs to the kitchen.

I was about to open the door to my backyard. When i noticed that there isn’t a bike outside! I asked Abby‘Abby where’s my bike’?

Abby said “it’s in the dark you just can’t see it”! I grabbed abby and hold her up to the window. And I saw what appeared to be a monster!

One that looked fat, and hiding in my bushes ready to pounce! Abby In a far more angry voice than before told me “lily put me down right now”!

I put her down on the floor. And ran up to my room as  Abby said “Lily please come back there’s nothing to be afraid of”!

And when I made it to my bedroom! I locked the door and hid under my bedsheets! That night I didn’t sleep at all.

The next day my mother knocked on my door telling me “lily come down stairs now” I unlocked the door and went downstairs. And when my mom showed me the bicycle outside! and my doll on the kitchen floor.

My mother said “lily you should put away your toys, after you play with them”. I went outside grabbed my new bike. and noticed that it had a strange device under the bike seat! I put the bike in my garage. not wanting to play with one anymore!

And when I went back inside. I asked my mom if she could take care of Abby for now on! My mother said “sure I’ll take care of your doll”

And then 10 years later! I was looking throw some old boxs. When I found my doll Abby! I noticed that it was covered in dust and barely maintained.

The fabric was ripping, the paint was chipping. But yet the eyes were still glowing! I was confused as to what was keeping them glowing. So I carefully took off Abby’s clothes!

And noticed that there was a zipper on Abby’s back! I unzipped it and looked inside. And found a walkie-talkie and a camera Inside of Abby.

Then my uncle Scott’s voice came through the walkie sounding older and meaner said “I’ll get you next time Lily”! That’s why Abby was really watching me sleep!
