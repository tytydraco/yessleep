The world as I had known it was gone.

It was no longer rosy and warm, but cold and gray. The color in my life was forever dimmed when I answered the telephone that night. Not only was Patrick, my youngest brother, dead, but he had died in one of the worst ways I could fathom.

“Our condolences are with you and your family, Mrs. Donovan.”

“Thank you.”

“Since your brother was predeceased by your parents and he had no spouse or children, you are his next of kin as his eldest sibling.”

“What does that mean?”

“You have been appointed the administrator of his estate,” he answered. “As meager as it may be.”

I was guided through the process of executing my brother’s estate, which was as meager as the probate lawyer said it would be. After I settled his debts and distributed what little assets he had, I was left with nothing more than his room in the rectory of his parish, which was going to be renovated before its next occupant moved in, as well as a box of his personal effects. The Crucifix he hung on the wall above his bed. The Rosary he received from our grandmother after his First Holy Communion. The family Bible with which he was trusted by Mom after his ordination to the priesthood.

As I sat on his bed, I looked through Patrick’s belongings. There were books, medals, and prayer cards, all of which were neatly arranged in the box, along with his diplomas. Near the bottom of the box, I found a framed picture of our family—Mom and Dad surrounded by their nine children, including myself and Patrick—which brought a smile to my face for the first time in a long time. I held the picture close to my chest as I started to cry. *Why, Patrick?* I cried in the empty room. *Why would you do this to us?* *To yourself?* *To God?*

*Why would you not let us in?*

I laid the picture frame to my side as I looked back into the box. At the very bottom was a small, leather–bound journal.

Although I wanted to respect Patrick’s privacy, especially in death, I was overcome by my desire to know the state of his body, mind, and soul in his final days. I had many unanswered questions. *Could I have helped him?* *What did I miss?* *What if, what if, what if?*. . . .

Opening the journal, I saw **Father Patrick Murphy** written in the corner of the first page. It was dated four weeks before his death. Turning the page, I read his first entry.

*Some stories should not be told.*

*There are stories so awful, horrible, terrible, that they should never even be told. Let them remain in the dark. The light of God Himself cannot reach them. They come from the deepest depths of Hell.*

*Since I cannot tell anyone about* ***it***, *I thought I would write about* ***it*** *in a journal. I hope this will help me.*

Patrick underlined the word “it” twice in the third paragraph, which confused me. *What did he mean?* I turned the page and read the second entry.

*I do not know how long this dark night of my soul will be.* ***It*** *lingers with me, even as I wait for the break of dawn.*

*Yet I cannot tell anyone about* ***it***. *Not my pastor, not my confessor, not even my family. I have to carry this burden on my shoulders. No one else can know.*

*What was he writing about?* I was confused. *What was* ‘it?’ *And why did* ‘it’ *frighten him as much as* ‘it’ *did?* I continued onto the third entry.

***Bless me, Father***. *Three words perverted by the stench of evil.*

*Evil?* I was even more confused. *Bless me, Father*. Did ‘it’ have something to do with Confession? Perhaps a sin he heard in the confessional? That would explain why Patrick could not tell anyone about ‘it,’ because he was bound by the sacramental seal. He could not reveal anything he learned in the confessional, even to his pastor, under the penalty of excommunication. The sacrosanct Seal of the Confessional applied to journals as well, but Patrick was clearly desperate to unburden himself. As a result of this, I was wary of continuing to read his journal, but I turned the page anyway.

*My Jesus, let this chalice pass from me. . . .*

*Please. . . .*

The page was stained with his tears. *Patrick, sweet Patrick. . . .* I cried as I read the depths of my brother’s despair. He must have felt alone. Completely and utterly alone. Through most of the remainder of his journal, Patrick wrote short prayers, beseeching God to help him. Whatever ‘it’ was, ‘it’ drove my brother to lose his faith and take his own life.

As I approached the end of his journal, I reached what appeared to be Patrick’s final entry, which was written over several pages. It was dated the night he died. *Was this his suicide note?* If it was, I was not sure if I wanted to read it. It would renew all of the pain of his death. However, I realized I needed some semblance of closure, so I reluctantly turned onto the first page of his final entry.

*There is no help for me.*

*I see* ***it*** *everywhere. I hear* ***its*** *voice in my ears, uttering those foul words. I feel* ***its*** *claws wrapped around my neck.* ***It*** *is getting closer. I will not be able to escape* ***its*** *embrace.*

*This is my last Confession.*

The final entry of Patrick’s diary is transcribed below.

*Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.*

*It happened on a sultry Saturday afternoon. I was hearing Confessions before celebrating the Vigil Mass. The usual group of older women came to confess their venial sins. After fifteen minutes passed without another penitent, I made the decision to start getting ready for Mass, but before I could leave the booth, I heard the door close and a woman’s whisper.*

***Bless me, Father.***

*Before I was able to say anything, the woman declared,* “I’m not confessing any sins, Father.”

*I was confused.* Why would she come into the confessional if she had no sins to confess? *Sitting down, I asked her,* “May I ask you to elaborate?” *I shifted uncomfortably in the booth.* “Do you have an issue you would like to discuss?”

“No,” *she answered.* “Not exactly.”

“What do you want to discuss?”

*In hindsight, I recognize she avoided answering my question by asking one of her own.*

“How is Father O’Reilly?”

*Fr. Joseph O’Reilly, our pastor, suffered from a heart attack the previous night. I was assuming his duties in the parish until he made a complete recovery. Yet something bothered me.*

How could she possibly know about it?

*No one in the parish knew of his heart attack. I had yet to tell them.*

I read the first two pages of Patrick’s final entry with dread. I did not know where it came from, but an all–encompassing sense of dread began to gnaw at me in the pit of my stomach. *Something was* not *right, but I did not know what.* I continued reading.

*I answered her,* “He is doing well,” *but I followed with,* “May I ask how you know about his condition?”

“I was there.”

*What did she mean? Fr. O’Reilly lived alone in the rectory. I could not dwell on this, because she continued,* “What a miracle he is still with us.”

“Are you a friend of his?”

“Yes,” *she answered.* “An intimate friend.”

*Wiping the sweat from my brow in the stifling confessional, I asked,* “Would you not like to continue this conversation in my office?”

“No,” *she said.* “I like the darkness. . . . ‘Out of darkness is born the light.’ Are we not called to be ‘bearers of light,’ Father?”

*‘Bearers of light?’* My years in Catechism as a student and then as a teacher led me to believe I knew where this was heading. It frightened me, but I could not help myself but turn the page.

*I was distracted by the heat, so I answered,* “Yes.” *There was a brief lull before I said,* “I apologize, but I have to celebrate the Vigil Mass. We can continue this conversation afterward.”

“There is no one else here, Father,” *she said*, “The church is empty. Only you and I remain.”

*What happened to the group of older women? Did they leave? And if they did, why? Before I was able to ask her about the parishioners, she interrupted my train of thought,* “Father O’Reilly was right about you.”

“What do you mean?” *I asked.*

“I’ve heard how he extols your virtues,” *she answered.* “Your innocence. Your purity. Your simplicity. A saint among us sinners.”

*Although I am loath to admit it, I blushed at her compliments, but I was able to recollect myself, and I said,* “No, I am just a priest. It is God Who deserves our praise.”

“Of course,” *she whispered,* “Yet you are a good shepherd of souls. I believe Elizabeth Hansley and all of her girlfriends would agree with me. They come to you for spiritual direction all the time.”

I was not privy to Patrick’s schedule, but I knew he was spiritual director of his parish, providing pastoral advice to his parishioners who sought his help. At his thirty years of age, he was a young priest, but he was experienced enough to solve the everyday crises of his parish and its associated parochial school.

“Pardon me?”

“Please, don’t be coy, Father Murphy,” *she insisted,* “It must be difficult to resist temptation. I wonder how often you’ve wanted to hike up their plaid skirts and screw them right there on your desk.”

*I was shocked into silence by her vulgarity, and she continued with a hollow laugh,* “Yes, you were disgusted you would even think of that. You confessed as soon as possible, but did you forgive yourself for thinking of it in the first place?”

The color drained from my face as I read her words, which were as foul as Patrick described them. I can only imagine how he reacted in the moment. I continued reading.

*I stammered,* “How do you know all of this?” *I began to spiral as those impure thoughts came back to my mind. Was I truly called to my vocation by God? Or was I a base and shameful sinner, unworthy to serve Him? I did not know anymore.*

“‘How?’ It was me. I planted that seed of sin in your mind. I am disappointed I didn’t see its harvest.”

“What?”

“Father O’Reilly assured you that these intrusive thoughts were not sins, but you did not believe him. . . .”

*How could God ever forgive me for what I thought? For what I felt? For what I almost did?*

“. . . .you are very important to him. If only he did not try to protect you. His heart simply could not take it.”

“Who are you?”

“I told you,” *she answered,* “A friend. Before that blessed water was poured on your lily–white forehead, I was there. Your fallen nature made you mine. Now you are an adopted son of God, co–heir with the Christ, but I am still here. Waiting. Watching. Whispering. Every sin, every offense, every dirty little impure thought of yours. They come from me.”

*She giggled while my mind raced. How* could *God forgive me? How* could *God love me? Why* would *God ever want to save me? I started to cry, softly, as she giggled. With tears in my eyes, I rebuked her,* “Whoever you are, you have no place here. The Lord our God is ever loving and merciful. Go back to Hell, foul thing!”

I held my hand over my mouth in horror as I turned to the final page of Patrick’s journal. The bottom corner of the page was singed as if someone burnt it. Patrick’s writing had become a scrawl, every word written several times over as if he were etching them in stone.

*Her giggles came to a slow stop, and she said,* “Wherever I am, I will be with you. I will be everywhere. And once I have devoured every ounce of faith and hope and love from your soul, I will come for you.” *Unable to endure her threats any longer, I burst out of my side of the confessional, and I opened the door to the other side.*

Holding my breath, I read what were possibly my brother’s last words.

*There was nothing there.*

***It*** *had gone.*

*Now* ***it*** *has come back for me.*

*Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me, a sinner.*

The journal ended with his final prayer.

Tears welled up in my eyes, which I wiped away with my thumb. Having read Patrick’s harrowing and horrifying account of his personal experience with evil, I did not know what to do with his journal. I decided to transcribe the entry, so I would never forget, but none of our brothers and sisters needed to know. It would stay between Patrick and myself.

When I stood up with the journal in hand, a small, folded piece of paper fell out from between its pages. It was marked, ***For Rosemary***. Picking it up, I unfolded the note. Several individual letters were written in the same scrawl as his final entry.

*Ros***e***mary,* **d***o not be fool***i***sh. Never would I* **c***oncede defeat.* **I***t co***u***ld appear differently.* *Plea***s***e, R***o***semary, read between my li***n***es.*

***Edicius on.***

***No suicide.***

I felt my heart drop to my stomach as I realized what he was trying to tell me.

Patrick did not commit suicide.

That was what it wanted us to think.

It took him.

Walking outside, I threw the journal into the garbage can, along with a lit match.

As I watched the fire burn like the flames of Hell, only one thought came to mind.
