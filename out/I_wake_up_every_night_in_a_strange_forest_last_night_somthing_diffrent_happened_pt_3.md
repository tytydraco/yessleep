apologies for my absence the past few mornings. My nights spent in the forest had been rather uneventful. However, last night I saw something. Perhaps someone.

I'm unsure if it is poor luck or a lack of time, but I can not seem to remain in the second clearing for long before I find myself back in the waking world. I have exhausted my supply of sleep aid and then another I had  ordered to my house. I have spent the bulk of the last two days in a forced slumber in some attempt to make sense of my bizarre dreams and their supposed effects on my body. However, no matter how much I sleep, I always find myself waking at the most crucial moments. I will stand and run to the clearing, sit down, clear my head, and then listen. Each time I begin to hear the whispers I wake up, there are times when I wake up before I even have the chance to make it to the clearing.

 attempt after grueling attempt I considered giving up entirely on traveling this way, though the damage my body has sustained tells me I am too far gone to abandon my current route. So, I persisted against my better judgment.

 I have received quite a few calls in the past few days from coworkers and family members expressing their concerns with my health and well being, I have ignored most of them to instead focus on the research of my predicament, the few calls I have responded to have been brief and dismissive just to avoid the police force coming to my door and disturbing my sleep.

I digress. Last night, I began the cycle of sleep again, now was a heightened dose of sleep aid to push past the immunity I have built. In frustration of my failures, I chose instead to walk instead of run in my most recent slumber. 

I moved past the trees with patience and care, doing what I could to examine them with more scrutiny than I had in the past, the trees that I have marked as a pathway…seem to be healing, the bark is returning in thin and sparse patches oddly enough resembling the scabs that are forming on my body. Some of them are leaking a rather vile and sickly looking black sap. Later, when I woke, I took note of a few wounds on my torso that have become infected. I need to treat them.

This discovery makes me wonder if my body is mirroring the forest or vice versa. Either choice gives equal concern, but I have come to believe the Latter. I have still yet to discover how my arm was broken a few nights ago.

 on my stroll when getting closer to the small tree, I decided that I would stop and meditate before I had arrived. The whispers were more potent there, and I could clearly make them out, but if it was an issue of proximity, I should still be able to hear them if I was only a short distance away.
This hypothesis proved to be correct…in a way. I sat and closed my eyes and waited for the message. 

I heard the whispers form, and I began to hone in on their meaning but was distracted by the sound of footfall on leaves and brush. 
My eyes shot open, and I looked around the dark wood, and I saw it. There was a man, or something adjacent, standing just about thirty feet ahead of me. It was thin and tall, shrouded in shadow and darkness. I could not make out its features at all. It was almost formless, a silhouette, a still image painted on top of the infinite backdrop.
 
I regret to say I froze for a moment, whether out of cowardice or curiosity, I am unsure. When I gained the ability to speak, I called out to it

“Hello” as simple as it is, this is all I could muster in my confusion.

“Hello” I heard the whispers respond. I was staring at one single entity, but thousands responded in a chorus of poorly stacked noises, only barely audible through their chaotic nature.

I did not stand and spoke out to it again 
“What is this place?” I asked. It

It mirrored my behavior and sat down, cross-legged on the ground and spoke again in its voice of legion “A path”

“to where?” I enquired now fully invested more than fearing

“a house” it spoke as it brushed an elongated finger against the bark of A tree it was seated next to

I felt a tinge of burning pain as it did so, as if a flame was placed just next to my skin only far enough away to not apply a visible wound to me. I winced and attempted to move away from the pain, but it followed no matter what position my arm rested in. The pain remained until the thing removed its finger to speak again 

“This is what your kind call it” 

I pondered for a moment, gripped by a paralysis laden with confusion. Possibly fear. Staring at this abomination brought me a great deal of discomfort and unrest. It simply stared back and me awaiting the bravery of a retort, which I thought myself incapable of. Eventually, however, I mustered the ability to speak once again

“Why am I in this place?” I asked, seeking to gain some information about my situation from the Being that seemed more than willing to guide me to some degree. 

“To Cultivate a piece of the garden” it said, standing and moving toward me in a formless mass of shadow and smoke. The thing floated more so Than it waked. It left after images behind itself as it moved gracefully forward in a strange dance. it had made its way to me entirely. The thing towered over me, not only in a physical way, but mentally, and spiritually As Well. This thing had ascended to a greater height than any mortal man I have met. I simply could not understand the magnitude in which the Shadow existed 

“you will give yourself to the wood like many have before” it said, brushing a hand. That felt like thousands across my face, leaving a streak of black along my cheek

“I will do no such thing” I retorted out of Instinct or pride

“You already Have” It spoke “and you will surely continue” it said moving to a tree and Lifting a hand to it “willingly or otherwise” it said Grabbing at the trunk of the tree and squeezing with impossible force. The trunk of the titan Cracked And crumbled under The weight of the things grip. I begged for it to stop. I swore to it that I would comply. And then I woke up gasping for air.

I woke up roughly an hour or so ago. I've been diagnosed with my ribs being likely broken. Some of my wounds are healing, though there's fester with a Slurry of pus and blackened ichor. My arm is still in a horrible way. It has only been a few days and nights, and it shows no sign of bettering anytime soon.

I refuse to assist this shadow in my dreams, I refuse to cultivate the garden. It speaks of it, and I will be damned if I am turned to an injured husk by the realm of sleep. I have now made it my purpose To unravel the inner machinations of my mind and discover this House that the shadow spoke of, I have invested far too much in my research to simply abandon it all and witness my own undoing brought on by a specter in my subconscious. 

I've still yet to understand how I am hurting myself in my sleep. I've thought perhaps I am not and all of this is more than a dream but I feel that is a ridiculous statement, I do not believe in the supernatural or the metaphysical and I refuse to play into the cartoonist rhetoric that my own mind is spewing in the hours I am sleeping.

I am now considering going back to my place of work and pilfering a supply of morphine to assist with my pain. It will also assist in my sleep. I have the knowledge to place myself into an induced coma. If I do not wake at all, then I will have all the time I need to make the necessary discoveries. I can take advantage of the concerned people in my life. Eventually, if I do not respond, they will come, and they will wake me, If they do not, I may pass on. However, it will be welcomed so long as I reach the answers to my many questions before I am taken by mortality.

I will update here when I feel it is necessary. Until then, I need to tend To My Injuries. I need to get some rest.
