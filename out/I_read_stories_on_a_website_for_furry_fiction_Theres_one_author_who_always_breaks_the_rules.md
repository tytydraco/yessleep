I'd like to preface this by saying there‚Äôs nothing sexual about my love for furry fiction. In fact this particular site I enjoy is exclusively for the non-sexual variety. No Dinorotica here! I'm not judging those who seek the other kind; we are what we are. It's just not for me personally.

When I was a kid I loved cartoons that featured anthropomorphic creatures. They were the only ones I watched. Lots of Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera, and my absolute favorite was Pink Panther!

As I got older I started to read books that focused on such creatures too. There was a series I loved set in a world of rodents. The main character was a mouse warrior protecting their land from the main villain; an evil, warlock rat. I never grew out of that love for anything involving humanoid animals. Though it's not exclusive these days, I do still enjoy sitting down a few nights a week to catch up on my favorite authors.

The quality of some of the stories is incredible. Some authors have created massive universes with complex characters, submitting content that could fill several novels. I'm no writer myself but for me, it's professional level entertainment. Even the stories that don't *quite* have those polished edges, I never forget that someone has worked hard on it and published it *for free*!

The site has a crude interface, like it never graduated from the 90s. I think it adds to the charm. When you sign up you create a unique handle (mine is the same as my Reddit handle, **rinky-dink-panther** in honor of my childhood favorite). Once verified you are free to read and comment on any of the stories, or submit your own. You can subscribe to the authors you love, so you never miss a story. There is also a direct chat option.

This particular site's theme is exclusively for stories set within worlds where humans don't exist. Other than that, authors are free to submit stories within pretty much any genre. There's everything from horror and fantasy, to suburban-set family drama.

There are a few rules of course:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* Stories must focus on furries/animals of some kind.
* No human characters allowed, including furry cosplay.
* Triggering content must be appropriately tagged.
* No erotica.
* Stories focusing on graphic violence, sexual violence, abuse etc. do not belong there.
* Be respectful at all times

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There's one author though whose stories are *never* in line with the site's rules:

**Jack\_Rabbit\_Slime**

I first noticed them a few months after I joined. Like similar sites, you can sort through content by using filters within certain time frames. Most likes, most views, most comments etc. That day, the story with the most likes was by that author, so I had a read.

They'd broken one of the rules within the first paragraph; the MC was a 'large, hairy man'. Even without that description, it was clear that the character was a human male. I had to stop reading after several paragraphs. Without going into detail, it described the MC performing sexual acts on his pet dog.

In need of eye bleach I scrolled straight down to the comments. How the hell was this the most liked story of the day?

&#x200B;

**Furgurl2001**: Amazing work as always!

**doug\_schmug**: Best writer on this site! Keep up the good work, man.

**HelenOfCroydon**: üòçüòçüòç

&#x200B;

Those are just examples in what was a sea of praise for **Jack\_Rabbit\_Slime's** gross story. But then I noticed one comment that stood out from the rest.

&#x200B;

**bastianbeast**: FFS, read the rules! You have been reported.

&#x200B;

Thank God the site hadn't gone completely mad! I took a leaf out of **bastianbeast's** book and reported the story to the site admins. Then I settled on something from an author I knew would make those mental images disappear; something a little more *Sylvanian Families.*

About a week later, another story by **Jack\_Rabbit\_Slime** appeared in the most liked of the day. Morbid curiosity made me click, and I started reading through squinted eyes.

It began with a cat giving birth to a litter of kittens, which was described as a traumatic event for the mother. The mental and physical aspects of giving birth were described in great detail, including the injuries received as a result.

Once the last kitten was born, the mother began to lick them clean. But she realized only one of the litter had survived. As a result of her suffering, the mother carried the only surviving kitten to a stream, where she proceeded to hold it under water.

I stopped reading there, although when I scrolled the page there were still several paragraphs left to go. It was clear that the disturbing story didn't fit within the site's rules. But once again, there was an abundance of love for the author in the comment section. Apart from one.

&#x200B;

**bastianbeast**: Reported. Like that will do any good. Come on admins!

&#x200B;

I clicked on **Jack\_Rabbit\_Slime's** handle to view their profile. They had many stories posted over the years, all of which appeared to be liked more than the average story. They had more than a thousand subscribers, which is a lot for this relatively small site. I randomly clicked on three of the past stories and scrolled straight to the comments. I wasn't surprised to see bastianbeast had commented on each one, the sole commenter opposing the stories amongst the *I love yous* and *bravos*.

After reporting **Jack\_Rabbit\_Slime's** latest atrocity, I decided to start a chat with bastianbeast.

&#x200B;

***Hey bastianbeast!***

***What's up with Jack\_Rabbit\_Slime? It seems like we're the only ones who care about the nasty shit they're subjecting the site to. Why aren't the admins doing anything? I'm reporting the stories too!***

***Hope you don't mind me contacting you, just wanted to let you know you're not alone.***

***rinky-dink-panther***

&#x200B;

At least a week went by and I hadn't received a response, despite them leaving comments of protest on the two Jack\_Rabbit\_Slime stories posted within that time. I was reading an instalment of one of my favorite series when a chat notification popped up.

&#x200B;

***Hi rinky-dink-panther!***

***Apologies for not getting back to you sooner. I've been reluctant to open chat requests, having received a lot of abuse here. You are well and truly a breath of fresh air!***

***I have no idea why their stories continue to be allowed but my attempts to shut them down have been fruitless. I've reported every story, and sent several direct messages to the admins. Each time I eventually get a reply it's along the lines of 'after investigating, we've decided they're not breaking any rules, blah blah blah.' Are they for real??***

***Honestly, I don't know why I bother. But I'm really happy to hear you are on my side. Perhaps together we can make a difference*** üôÇ

He was actually Seb from Omaha, Nebraska. My real name is Nate and I reside just outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma. We became friends and chatted regularly via Skype, realizing we had more in common than just a mutual appreciation for a particular type of fiction. Not being a million miles away from each other, we even discussed meeting in person at some point in the near future.

We continued to report **Jack\_Rabbit\_Slime's** stories, and I began publicly commenting on them too in hope it would encourage other readers to do the same. One evening I logged in to the site and had a chat notification. My heart jumped when I saw who it was from:

**Jack\_Rabbit\_Slime wants to chat. Accept / Decline**

I must have stared at the screen for several minutes, fingers tapping on my desk before eventually opening the message.

&#x200B;

***Hey there rinky-dink-panther. Or should I say Nathan?***

***I'm glad to see you're a fan of my work‚Ä¶ LOL! Your attempts to cancel me are failing, it's just super annoying really. Why can't you just appreciate my art?***

***If you don't quit your shit things are going to get nasty for you and Sebastian. So just stop it now, okay?***

***Regards,***

***J.R.S***

&#x200B;

The first thing I did was call Seb via Skype, but he didn't answer. My heart was beating hard as I paced the room for a while, and I felt a little relief when I heard the Skype ringtone.

"What's up, doc?" he said as his face appeared on the screen.

"Less of the rabbit references, dude," I said. "I'm freaking out here! Guess who messaged me?"

"Shit," he said. "On the site?"

I nodded. "He knows my name too."

"Hold on a sec, man," he said, tapping on the keyboard. "I've got a new request too. Yep, it's from Jack."

He read it out loud. It was similar to mine.

"Try not to worry too much, Nate. I've been receiving messages like this from his fans for a while now. I'm actually surprised it's taken him this long to message me directly. They're just empty threats."

"But he knows my name, Seb! That's fucked up!"

"I get it, dude," he said. "Guess I'm just used to this kind of harassment now. For those that know how, finding out your real name wouldn't be difficult. Honestly Nate, don't dwell on it. He's a cunt, we both know that."

Once our conversation was over I reported the message. Despite what Seb had said, it took me a while to fall asleep that night. Later the next day, I'd received a response from the admins:

**Thank you for your report. We investigated and have found that this doesn't violate any of our policies‚Ä¶**

"What the fuck!" I yelled out loud. Whether it was serious or not, a threat like that most definitely broke their policies! I text Seb to let him know the bullshit decision. He responded a few minutes later.

***Fuck them. Fuck Jack. Let's go for it***.

We went through **Jack\_Rabbit\_Slime's** entire back catalogue of stories and bombarded the comment sections in protest. It didn't take long before I started to receive my own hate mail from his fans. Each one made me feel awful, but it had become a personal mission to cancel him. So we continued.

Jack had posted at least twice a week for several years. Almost a week went by with no new story. By the end of the next week there was still no story, and the harassment from his fans began to dwindle too. It was a small win but it felt like we‚Äôd achieved something.

Last night I was chatting to Seb over Skype when my doorbell rang, so I said I‚Äôd call him right back. I looked through the peephole and couldn‚Äôt see anyone, just the dimly lit hallway of my apartment building. I opened the door and looked both ways down the hall. There was no one around. As I turned back my foot tapped something.

It was a bright pink gift box, about 6x6‚Äù. It was sealed with white ribbon and topped with an elaborate bow. I crouched down to pick it up, wondering if it was left by mistake. But there was a tag tucked under the ribbon handwritten with '*Nathan x*'. I smiled to myself as I shut the door and carried it through my apartment. I had no idea what the occasion was but it was quite exciting!

I placed the box on my dining table and sat down, untying the ribbon and removing the lid. There was a printed card sitting on top of white tissue paper. It was postcard sized, white with an ornate pink border. The words were written in black in beautiful handwriting:

**He‚Äôs the one and only, truly original, panther pink from head to‚Ä¶**

"Toe!" I said out loud, chuckling to myself. I flipped the card but it was blank. I thought it might have been from my mom, who had entertained my Pink Panther obsession throughout childhood. She was also one of the very few people in my life who still called me Nathan. But she's not the mystery surprise type, and she wouldn‚Äôt have left it and ran.

I put the card down and removed the layers of tissue paper, a big grin on my face. It was short lived.

"Jesus!" I yelled, pushing the box away from me and sliding the chair back from the table. My hands covered my mouth as I processed what I thought I'd seen. I sat for at least five minutes just staring at the side of that box, my heart racing. When I eventually talked myself into looking closer I wasn't mistaken.

It was a severed paw from a large animal. And the fur was pink.

I heard a notification sound come from my laptop. I stepped away from the table to my desk. It was a chat response from **Jack\_Rabbit\_Slime**.

&#x200B;

***Jack: A very happy un-birthday to you, Nate. I hope you liked the gift?***

***Me: How do you know where I live you sick fuck??***

***Jack: There's not a lot I don't know. I know what you ate for breakfast, too.***

***Me: Bullshit!***

***Jack: No, it was fried eggs over-easy. And bacon. You burned the bacon though, silly.***

***Me: So what, you're spying on me through my phone? Laptop?***

***Jack: Lol, no! But don't you worry about that. Hey, did you see my new post? It's just for you. Enjoy x***

&#x200B;

I checked the post feed on the website and sure enough, there was a new story from Jack posted within the last hour. The title alone made me shiver.

&#x200B;

**The Pink Paw, posted by Jack\_Rabbit\_Slime**

**Have you ever seen a panther that is pink?** ***Think!*** **A panther that is positively pink?**

**When you were a little boy, all you ever dreamed about was seeing a real pink panther. The day your mommy told you 'pink panthers are only in cartoons' was a sad day for lil Nate, wasn't it?**

***Surprise!***

**As you can see from your gift, mommy lied. Pink panthers** ***are*** **real. That's a genuine, positively pink panther paw. You're welcome!**

**I've got something for Sebastian too‚Ä¶ though I think I'm going to hand it to him in person.**

***Ring-ring!***

&#x200B;

Already on edge, I jumped out of my skin as the ringtone kicked in.

**Jack wants to connect with you on Skype**

The profile picture was a cute cartoon rabbit, with rosy whiskered cheeks and sparkling eyes. I stared at the screen in disbelief, my heart racing.

Another line appeared on the post.

***Answer it!***

I braced myself and accepted the request. The camera was in what looked like an apartment building foyer, with rows of post boxes on one wall. It got closer to the boxes and focused on one in particular.

**Sebastian \[REDACTED\], Apt. 303**

"No!" I screamed at my laptop screen. A large, furry gray paw came into view and gave a thumbs up, before turning to a staircase.

I ended the call and dialled Seb, my hands shaking.

"Come on, come on!" I said impatiently, tapping my desk. He answered after a few rings.

"Yo, who was your visitor?"

"Seb, that freak is in your building!" I yelled, leaning close to the cam.

"The what now?" he asked, confused.

"Jack rabbit slime! He's coming to your apartment!"

"Whoa, Nate. This isn't cool."

"I swear on my life! Apartment 303, right?"

He looked worried. "How the fuck do you know that?"

"I saw it on video, Seb. He called me!"

He looked around his vicinity. "Fuck dude. You're not kidding, are you?"

"No! Get the fuck out, or hide or something!"

With a loud bang, a door behind Seb slammed open. The light from the hallway gave a clear silhouette of who was responsible. It was a vaguely humanoid shape with long rabbit ears.

"Jesus Chri‚Ä¶" Seb screamed before the connection cut out.

"Seb!" I cried out, attempting to call him back. It rang and rang with no answer. "Seb!" I slammed my hands on the desk in frustration. I picked up my phone, deciding I had to call the police. I had no clue where exactly he lived but I had to try.

"911, what's your emergency?"

"My friend is in danger! He's in Omaha, but I don't know where. Apartment 303, that's all I know!"

"Calm down, sir. What makes you think your friend is in danger?"

"We were on a video call and this freak in a rabbit costume who's been threatening us burst into his apartment."

There was a pause and a sigh.

"Sir, where is your friend's apartment?"

"It's somewhere in Omaha, apartment 303! That's all I know!"

"Sir, this is Tulsa. We're going to need more details if we're to get you through to‚Ä¶"

I stopped hearing them as Jack's post updated again.

**Hang up. Now! Or I'll cut out his fucking tongue.**

I pulled my hair as I trembled. Then I heard the person on the other end of the phone again.

"Sir? Sir, are you there?"

"I‚Ä¶ I'm sorry to bother you, bye!"

I hung up and put my phone on the desk, watching as the post updated in real time.

**You'd better get your ass to Omaha, Nathan. Come to this address: \[REDACTED\]. I'll give you 24 hours, Sebastian depends on it. Oh, and I have another surprise here for you, too! I'm about to make your childhood dream come true‚Ä¶**

That was the last I heard from Jack. I can't believe this is happening, all because of some fucking internet stories! I've done the research. It looks like a 7ish hour drive from here to the address I was given.

I can't procrastinate any longer. I'm terrified, but I've gotta help Seb. I'll update when I can. *If* I can.
