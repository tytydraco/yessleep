It started as a minor inconvenience. At first, I thought it was a prank—some colleague trying to mess with me. My office calendar, the one hanging right above my desk, was showing the wrong dates. On Monday, it showed Friday’s date. On Wednesday, it was showing Sunday’s. I chuckled, thinking it was just a harmless joke.

I reset it, of course. But the next morning, it was wrong again. This time, it was off by a month. I frowned, adjusting it back. A nagging feeling of unease began to settle in my gut, but I shrugged it off. Surely, someone was having a laugh at my expense.

A few days later, it got weirder. The calendar began showing dates that didn’t exist. March 32nd. November 31st. I even saw a February 30th. My irritation grew. I asked around, trying to catch the culprit, but everyone seemed genuinely baffled.

Then came the messages. On the morning of August 45th, I found a note scribbled on the calendar: "Remember to lock the door." I stood there, staring at it, trying to make sense of it. That evening, as I was about to leave, I noticed my office door was ajar. I distinctly remembered closing it before heading to a meeting. I shook my head, locking it this time, and went home.

The next morning, the date read September 3rd, 2045. There was another message: "Check the window." I turned, and to my horror, the window was wide open. Papers were scattered everywhere. I knew I hadn’t touched that window in weeks. A cold sweat broke out across my forehead as I quickly shut and locked it.

I decided to take the calendar down. Enough was enough. But as I reached for it, my phone buzzed. It was a text from an unknown number: "Don't remove it. You need to know." My heart raced. I glanced around the office, feeling watched.

That night, I stayed late, determined to catch whoever was messing with me. I set up a hidden camera and waited. Midnight came and went. Nothing. Exhausted, I fell asleep at my desk.

I woke up to the sound of my phone buzzing. It was another text: "Look at yesterday." Groggy and disoriented, I checked the calendar. It showed yesterday’s date, along with a new note: "Car keys under desk." I reached under the desk and, sure enough, found my missing car keys. They’d been gone for days, and I had assumed I’d lost them somewhere at home.

Panic set in. How did the calendar know? Who was behind this? The texts continued, each one eerier than the last. "Turn off the coffee machine." "Don't answer the phone at 3:00 PM." Every instruction seemed mundane but unsettlingly accurate.

One morning, the calendar showed a future date: October 10th, 2025. The note read: "Stay home." Fear gripped me. Was this a warning? I decided to heed it. I called in sick that day, refusing to leave the safety of my home.

At 3:00 PM, I received a frantic call from a colleague. There had been a gas leak in the office. Several people were hospitalized. My blood ran cold. The calendar had saved my life.

I couldn’t take it anymore. The calendar was no longer just a nuisance; it was a harbinger of strange, inexplicable events. I tore it down and threw it in the dumpster outside.

The next day, it was back on the wall, showing the correct date but with one final message: "You can’t get rid of me."

I moved out of that office, transferred to another location. But even now, I can’t escape the feeling that somewhere, in some forgotten drawer or dusty corner, the calendar is still there, silently counting down to the next date I’m meant to see.

If you ever find a calendar that doesn’t match reality, one that seems to know more than it should, take it seriously. It might be trying to tell you something. And whatever you do, don’t ignore its warnings.
