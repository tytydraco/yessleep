I stumbled out, willing my legs to keep going. I was barefoot, wearing a hospital gown. I had no money, no phone, no idea where I was. I was surrounded by large brick buildings in varying stages of dilapidation. I walked through a maze of alleys, empty lots, until I reached a real road. I never knew I could be so thrilled at the site of a beaten-up little VW bug rolling down a pothole ridden blacktop. I lunged onto the street, flailing my arms, begging the car to stop. The driver bared down on the horn, swerved around me and sped away. I trudged onward, finally making it to a tiny gas station. I walked in, the young man behind the counter barely reacted. He raised one eyebrow, “Rough day?”

A wild, manic laughter burst out of me, unbidden. He shifted uncomfortably and asked if I needed anything.

“Phone. Please.” I said breathlessly, regaining composure. He handed me his cell phone and I dialed 911.

Two police cruisers and an ambulance arrived on the scene about twenty minutes later. A rush of relief flooded me, but as the EMTs emerged from the ambulance, I went cold with dread. What if they aren’t really EMTs? What if they take me back? I broke down, collapsing onto my knees in the middle of the greasy little store. The police asked me a thousand questions. I had very few answers. I was checked out by the EMTs, one offering to give me something to calm my nerves.
“NO!” I yelped, retreating a few steps back from the man. He raised his hands in a gesture of silent apology. I refused to ride in the ambulance or be taken to the hospital for further examination, although they strongly encouraged I do so. I rode in one of the police cars in order to give a full statement back at their precinct. After driving for a few minutes, I asked for the date. The cop paused for a moment, looked at the laptop mounted between the two front seats and said, “May 3rd.” I had gone to the urgent care February 6, 2019.

“What year?”

“2024,” he said, bemused.

I spent hours giving my statement to increasingly skeptical officers. They told me I was reported missing by my cousin mid-March 2019. My apartment was abandoned. My car was also abandoned. I had driven it to the urgent care the night they took me, but it was found in the parking lot of my apartment building.

“What happened to my stuff?” I asked, as if it mattered. The officer looked at me, guilt splashed across his face.

“Your apartment was cleared out. Items were either donated or tossed out. The apartment was cleaned and rented back out. The car was impounded, eventually sold at an auction,” he told me. Later I found out that after a year with no leads, nothing, my family assumed I was dead. They gave me a funeral. I have a tombstone – a small, rather shitty little slab of granite that simply has my name, date of birth and “death.” I won’t say that wasn’t a kick to my ego. I have a grave, an empty coffin. My hollowed bit of earth has been the only thing holding my place in this world while I was hidden away.

There was no evidence of the Urgent Care existing, at least not when I went in that night. There had been a small medical practice at that address, but it had closed its doors back in 2017. They had moved to a larger space closer to the downtown area.

I gave a description of where I was held, what I could remember of the surrounding area, and it could not have been that far from where I was picked up since I was able to walk there. It took a few days for the officers to narrow down the options. Finally, they told me the most likely place was this cluster of abandoned warehouses. I urged them to send teams and storm the place. Get S.W.A.T. Get the National Guard. They did nothing.

“Unfortunately, Ms. LaFleur, the whole place is nothing but brick and dust. Couple uniforms were sent over to check it out, but it’s been completely demolished,” I sat there, dumbstruck for a few moments. “No. You’re wrong. I was just there. Not three days ago. They can’t just blow up a bunch of buildings. Someone would have heard it! Or seen it!” Apparently no one had.

One officer told me that the whole area had once been used by the military for storage and supplies for the base a few miles west of here, but they had long since stopped using it.

I had nothing left to give as proof. They pitied me. They knew I had been through trauma. There were clear signs of psychological damage. I must have spoken to a dozen different shrinks. I eventually let them do a full medical workup, provided they let me stay in sight of at least one door and one window, both looking to the outside and no drugs of any kind. I had bruises in varying states of healing all over my body. I had a couple cracked ribs, and they told me the injuries were consistent with fighting. I had no memory of even being out of the bed, but they said it was not possible to have been bedridden for that long and not have some signs of atrophy or even weakening. My muscles and skin were toned; my reflexes were above average. Nothing in my story could be corroborated, not even by my own body.

Eventually they released me to my relatives, told me they would be in touch with any new information, and to take care. As my cousin led me to her car, speaking to me as though I were an unstable bomb made of the most delicate glass, I looked across the street. She was there, just visible in the shadows. I shrieked and pointed. “It’s the other me! There! Go! She’s there!” They were all too startled by and concerned about me to see the not-me slink back into the darkness and disappear. 

I have been trying to convince everyone, including myself, that I am NOT crazy. I know what happened. I was there. It…was…real…

One day, about six months after my escape, the phone rang. “Ms. Lafleur?”

“This is she. Who is this?”

“This is Officer Keshner. Would you be able to come down to the station? We have a few follow up questions regarding your case.”

“Of course! Did something happen? Did you find something new?” I asked, intense excitement and dread rising like a tide inside me. 

“Yes. I can't discuss the details at the moment…but you said you were an only child, correct?” 
“Uh, yeah. And my parents passed away years ago. It's just me.” They have her, I thought. That had to be it. They think she's some bizarro twin. 
“Ok. Can you come today? Now?” He asked. 
“Yes. I will head there now.”

I had been living in an apartment on my own for almost a month. My cousin, Michelle, had insisted I stay with her after everything. I didn't object. She was always like the little sister I never had. Her parents, my mother's brother and his wife, had moved to Florida when she was heading to college. She has two older brothers, Ryan and Lee. The whole family came together when I popped back into the world. It was nice, but then they all had to return to their lives, drifting off back to familiar routines. Michelle had a small, one bedroom place, and after a few months on the couch (I refused to let her give up her bedroom for me), I knew I needed to get my own place. I settled for a unit in the same complex as Michelle and we still spent most every evening together, watching television or just talking. So, she was sitting on my couch when I got the call. 
“Who was that, Liz?” she asked, seeing the fear etched into my face. 

“The police. I have to go to the station. For questions” I told her in a robotic tone. I felt numb. 
“Let me get my shoes on. I'm coming with you.” I told her it wasn't necessary, but she wouldn't hear it. We climbed into her little blue Kia and zipped off down the road. We parked in the little lot in front of the police station. I took a moment to take deep breaths, in through the nose, out through the mouth. It didn't calm my nerves. We met Officer Keshner at the front desk. He was an abnormally tall man, thick like a bodybuilder with a shaved head and a square jaw. He told Michelle to wait in the row of chairs near the door. She was about to protest, and I waved her off. “I'll be fine. I'll tell you everything when I get out,” I said as reassuringly as I could manage. 

The officer led me back into a small room, similar to the one I had given my initial statement. He gestured to a chair on the opposite side of the table that occupied most of the room’s space. Then he sat down in the other chair. He had a blue, official looking folder in his hand and sat it on the surface between us. 

“Ms. Lafleur… I'm going to show you some photographs. They are not going to be pleasant. If you need to take a break or…anything, let me know. You're not in trouble here. But we've never encountered a situation like this. The captain has been on the phone damn near all day trying to figure out if this needs to be handled by the FBI, military, or some other alphabet agency.” he told me, keeping his voice level. He opened the folder and removed a stack of pictures. He laid them in a row in front of me giving a gentle thwack of the print paper as each hit the tabletop. 

There were five pictures. The first was of a man, bloody, caked in dirt. The doctor. The second… my eyes locked onto the horrible image and my heart sprinted away, urging the rest of my body to follow. It was me. Dead. This wasn't a strange, poor copy like the one that saved me. This was me. My ears were ringing, and I didn't realize I had jumped up from the chair and backed into the wall behind me. Keshner was sliding a small black trash can next to me, and, upon seeing it, I retched. I threw up hard, as if my body was attempting to expel something lethal.

I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand, my entire body trembling as I forced myself to look back at the photograph. It wasn’t just that the dead woman looked like me—it was me. The same sharp angle of my jaw, the same faint scar on my eyebrow from a childhood fall, the same freckle just below my left eye. Her hair was a little shorter than mine, her skin pallid, but otherwise, she could have been my reflection frozen in time. A thick, jagged wound split across her throat, dried blood darkening the fabric of her hospital gown. My stomach lurched again, but there was nothing left to bring up. I pressed my back against the wall, desperate to put more space between myself and the impossible truth staring up at me from the table.
 
“This was found three days ago,” Keshner said, his voice low but steady. “An anonymous call led officers to an abandoned lot near the old shipping yards. She was already dead when they got there—her body wasn’t fresh, but it hadn’t started decomposing the way it should have. Toxicology came back inconclusive. No prints in the area. No security cameras. And no ID except for this.” He reached into the folder and slid a plastic evidence bag across the table. Inside was a hospital bracelet, still smudged with dried blood. I didn’t need to read it—I already knew what it would say. Lafleur, Elizabeth. Admitted: February 6, 2019. My vision wavered, my pulse hammering in my ears. This was supposed to be my hospital band. The one I had woken up with. The one that should have still been on my wrist. But I was alive. Wasn’t I?

My mind erupted into a cacophony of unanswerable questions. What did those people do?! Are these clones of me? How? Were they just made to look like me? And the one thought circling like a vulture above all the others: Am I really…me?

I remember my life. All the things you’re supposed to remember: my childhood, growing up in a nice little neighborhood, friends, relatives, birthdays, holidays, boyfriends. I remember my parents dying in a car wreck when I was 19. I still felt the heartache of that day, faded but still there. Officer Keshner was patient, silent, while I stared down at this gory image of myself, processing. I looked up at him, his eyes meeting mine. There was a hard exterior to him, but I sensed a kindness, too. He wanted answers almost as much as I did. He held my gaze for another moment then dropped his eyes to the third picture.

It was grotesque. The image was a shallow hole (grave?) filled with body parts. Some were deformed or mutated. There was a severed arm with two hands, a leg without a knee, and the heads… They were cruel imitations of me with varying degrees of imperfection. I grabbed the trashcan from the floor, feeling sick once more, but there was nothing left in my stomach. The fourth picture was another angle of the body parts. The fifth picture was different. It was smaller than the first four, it was in color (the others had been black and white) and looked as if it was taken with a regular digital camera. It had a timestamp on the bottom right: JAN 9 2021 08:16 AM. I snatched it off the table and held it close to my eyes, taking in every detail. It was me again, whole, healthy, alive, and in the world. It was a candid shot of me, sitting on a bench somewhere, possibly a park. I was wearing the jacket I bought from that thrift store and the shoes I paid way too much for in this fancy shop downtown. I hated them because they pinched my toes and rubbed my heel, but I wore them because they were too expensive to leave in the closet. But this still wasn’t me – not the me currently sitting in the police station. I was trapped in an underground nightmare for the entirety of 2021. My mouth hung open in shock. I flipped the image around to Keshner. “How?”

“Suffice it to say, we don’t know. These four pictures – “he swept his hand over the other photographs, “were taken by our crime scene techs. This one,” he pointed at the image in my hand, “was sent to us.”

“Sent? By whom? When?” I demanded.
“It was left in an envelope on the front desk. It had your name and case number written on it. There were no fingerprints on the exterior or interior of the envelope. None on the photo and none on the note that came with it.” Keshner explained.

“There are cameras EVERYWHERE in here. You didn’t see who left it?” I was almost yelling at him, frustrated beyond belief.

“No. We have combed through our security footage. We get a lot of foot traffic in and out of here. We have followed up with everyone that could be identified on the tapes going back a week before it was found. We’ve got nothing. No leads.” He admitted, sounding defeated.
“Wait, you said there was a note? What note? What did it say?” I asked, unsure I wanted to know.

“The note was typed. It had directions to that body,” he pointed to the second picture, “and to the…disposal site of the…body parts. That was it. We checked it out, and this is what we have. Someone wanted us to find all of this, but we can’t understand who or why at this point.”
