I was going on my way home from work in my blue ford pickup truck. When my route was blocked off because of a traffic jam! So, I had to take a detour and as I was driving down an empty Tennessee road. I encountered a tunnel! It did not appear on my GPS. But I went through it!

As I was driving through. the car, the radio which was once playing country music went static. But I didn't care at the time! But then I noticed that the tunnel seemed to never stop. In fact, I felt as if it was getting longer!

Then after what felt like an hour. I noticed a red ford pickup truck! But it had nobody inside. I was confused by this! And as I tried to explain this to myself! The radio turned on and a woman's voice began saying “we're going the wrong way”! Over and over again.

I tried to turn off the radio, but it would not stop! Then I noticed that the pickup truck was gone. I thought it might have gone past me. But then I saw it in the mirror on the roof of the tunnel! I now believed I was going crazy!

But then the woman's voice on the radio started counting “10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1”! Then all the lights in the tunnel turned off and I felt as if I was driving into the abyss. I turned on my car's headlights and could see 10 red ford pickup trucks that had no driver!

Then the woman's voice appeared on the radio once again! It said “we’re going the wrong way”! Over and over again. I was now starting to get the feeling that I shouldn't be here! And then the lights turned on again!

And all of the red ford pickup trucks were now on fire and had skeletons inside them! And then the woman's voice on the radio started laughing and saying, “we all go the wrong way”! And then I saw a giant green harvester come around a corner!

It had its blades on and was driving right towards me! I put the gear in reverse and started driving down the tunnel in reverse! Suddenly the lights went red and the voice on the radio started saying “you’re going the wrong way”! Over and over again

As the harvester was coming towards me. I noticed that nobody was driving it as well! And then the voice on the radio was screaming in an ear-piercing voice “no, no, no" over and over again! And then the woman's voice said soberly “I almost got you.”

And now I was suddenly out of the tunnel and the radio started playing country music again but now it was backwards! And as I turned off the radio, I saw that the tunnel disappeared! And then I noticed that the sky was orange, and the sun was black. But at least I was out of that tunnel.
