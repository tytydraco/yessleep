I know the police are looking for me. I know nothing I say or anything I’ve documented here will convince them I’m not crazy. But everything I’ve written and continue to write is true. 

As soon as I put the jacket on I felt a shift. But it isn’t what you would imagine. It isn’t pain, not initially. It feels almost intoxicating. Pleasant. Like you’re falling into the nicest, deepest sleep of your life. 

But it’s right after that pleasant feeling fades where you feel something worse than torture.

It tightened around my torso like cling wrap. I could barely breathe.

I tried to rip it off but it wrapped itself tighter around me. I felt my ribs crack. I shouted and a scream barely escaped my lips.

I grabbed my razor from the bathroom sink and sliced into the jacket—

That’s when I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, *the Old Man was standing right behind me.* His body was riddled with gooey open sores, his teeth jagged and stained yellow. He put his lips right against my ear as he spoke, with every word smoke puffed out from his mouth, like he was exhaling fire.

“Don’t you want to see Hannah, James? You can’t see her if you take me off.”

“You’re lying!” I screamed back, I didn’t want to believe him.

“Give me a chance to show you. It’s worth it, isn’t it?” He continued “or would you rather live with the agonizing hell of knowing you could have had her back.”

My heart felt like it dropped from my chest, “what did you say?” I stared back at him in the mirror and he winked at me. 

I loosened my grip on the razor.

The Old Man smiled. “open your hand” he said.

I did as he told me. Then he reached up and ripped both his eyes out of the sockets in his head. 

He plopped his bloody eyeballs in my palm and told me to “put them in.”

I raised them up to my face, brought them to my eyes and—

Was suddenly back at Hidden Gems. I had been instantaneously transported. The store was dark. It was the middle of the night. A faint street light extended through the front windows just enough for me to see. 

Then slowly but surely the overhead lights began to flicker on. One by one lighting up the store. 

Suddenly the store’s bell rang out and Hannah walked through the front doors. 

It was like time stopped. It had been two years since I saw her like this, “alive”. I couldn’t believe it. What was she even doing here I thought? Everything else slipped away, nothing before now seemed to matter. 

She moved throughout the aisles, perusing different items. 

I followed behind her. I didn’t say anything, not at first. I was in shock, wondering if this was real.

She kept fingering through clothes when she stopped on something, a windbreaker, she pulled it off the rack and held it up to herself. 

I recognized this windbreaker. It’s the one she had been wearing when she was killed. This is where she bought it. Hidden Gems had something to do with Hannah’s death. I thought maybe now if I stopped her before she put it on, I could save her. 

“Hannah” I yelled, she turned and headed toward the front of the store with the windbreaker in hand. I said her name again, she didn’t hear me.

I moved after her but couldn’t catch her. It was like I was on a walkway that was moving backwards as I ran forward. 

She met Agatha at the front counter and asked “how much?”

Agatha simply said “Nothing. This one was made for you. It’s yours.”

I shouted at the top of my lungs “No!”

I ran up and tried to intervene. I pleaded, I screamed, I slammed my hand on the counter but they continued talking as though I didn’t exist. 

Agatha turned her head and looked right at me without missing a beat or Hannah seeming to notice and said, “she can’t hear you, James. She can’t see you. Just watch.” 

Hannah walked out of the store with the windbreaker, I followed her out and onto the street.

But it wasn’t the front of Hidden Gems. I stood on a different street altogether, a quiet residential block that felt familiar in a distant, unsettling way. I was turned around, but I was starting to grasp what the Old Man was showing me. 



Then I caught a glimpse of Hannah at the end of the block, she was jogging. 

I ran after her as fast as my legs would let me. She began slowing down, she was limping and making noises like she was in pain. She tried to pull the windbreaker off, it was stuck to her like the jacket had been stuck to me and Emma. 

I yelled out for her, knowing in the back of my mind that there was nothing I could do. 

As I got closer she got part of the windbreaker up over her head. She screamed out as she was pulling it off. She stumbled off the sidewalk and into the street just as a van sped around the corner and hit her. 

She flew backward and hit the ground with a thud. I ran into the street, screaming her name, screaming for help,  but it came out thin and useless, like yelling through layers of wet cloth.

“Hannah!” I dropped to my knees beside her. She was still alive. Barely. Her breath fluttered in her chest. Blood began to pool beneath her head.

The van stayed put, its harsh white headlights on and engine running. Then in an instant it sped off as quickly as it could.

Hannah tried to lift an arm, but her body jerked with pain. I reached out on instinct, desperate to help, to do *something* but I knew the ending already, there was nothing I could do. I reached out for her hand and mine passed through hers like I was nothing but smoke.

And then the very next moment, she took her last breath. Seeing her death, experiencing it was completely different. Knowing this was the past didn’t help. 

But now I knew that Hidden Gems was responsible for her death. The van hit her, but only because of the windbreaker. And right then, all I wanted to do was make them pay.

Then it hit me…

There was no reason for me to see this. The Old Man just needed to get me to put on the jacket. 

“James”, I heard Hannah’s voice call out behind me.

I turned and there she was. Alive and well. She looked amazing, the healthiest and happiest I had ever seen her.

“Wake up” she told me. I stared at her a moment longer, then she insisted,  “Wake up now!”

I snapped awake, face-down on the bathroom floor, my cheek pressed against the cold tile. The jacket had cinched itself around me, clamping my arms to my sides like a straight-jacket.

The Old Man was lying on top of me.

His body flattened and spread across mine. His face was pressed against the side of my own, our cheeks mashed together, his breath leaking hot and putrid against my skin.

Then something worse happened.

He started pushing into me. His face began fusing with mine, like his skin was melting wax pouring over my face. His temple began sinking into my own. 

The pain was excruciating. I screamed and he echoed my shouts. I could feel his yells vibrating through my teeth, like it was coming from my own mouth. 

I tried to push myself up, I rolled over, I struggled to fight free but the jacket tightened even more. It had a vice grip on me.

The Old Man’s lips found my ear and he whispered, “make room, Jamie boy. I’m coming in… and I’m going to wear you forever.”

I thought of Hannah. I couldn’t let Hidden Gems get away with her death. A rage like I had never felt took over. 

I pushed myself up again. The Old Man laughed as I did, mocking me. I kept moving through the resistance of the jacket, fighting it. I pushed through the pain. It tightened more, my ribs popped but I kept pushing. I reached up and got a hold of the sink, I gripped it, wrapping my fingers around its lip. I used my other arm to leverage my weight against the floor and pulled myself up.

I grabbed the razor from the sink and began slashing at the jacket, desperate to loosen its grip.

The Old Man growled as I kept cutting into it. “There’s nothing you can do. She already belongs to the store” he said.

I sliced even more. I sliced so deeply that blood began flowing from my forearm.  But I could feel the jacket soften, it’s clutch beginning to give way. 

I looked at the Old Man in the mirror, our temples still fused together. He had a panicked look in his eyes. I sliced the jacket across my torso one more time and it completely gave way.

The Old Man disappeared, but my temple where he had fused to me was bloody and raw. I slid the jacket off, it looked like it had been chewed up by a lawnmower.  I was cut badly across my arms and torso, bleeding significantly in several places.

I got my first aid kit and stitched myself up the best I could. I stopped the bleeding for the most part but I’m hurt. My ribs are broken in a few places and I need more help than I’m able to give myself.

But I have to get to Hidden Gems. I can’t let them get away with what they did to Hannah or kill anyone else.

This may be the last time I write. 

I’m going to burn the store to the ground and make sure it never hurts a living soul again. They have to be stopped.

Please make sure this is seen, in case I fail, everyone needs to know: Stay away from Hidden Gems.
