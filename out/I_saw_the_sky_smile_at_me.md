The sky smiled at me. I can’t say it was a dream. Dreams dissolve with dawn, but day after day, I still remember. That night, the clouds parted as though drawn back by invisible hands, and behind them was a grin stretched across the heavens, filled with teeth. It opened wide, comets drooling from its lips. From that abyss came a voice. A girl’s voice. Quiet, sorrowful, calling to me as if she had always known me. She called my name.

Since then, nothing has held me. Not the walls of my apartment, not the routines of waking life. I return here each night, climbing the iron stairs to this rooftop, to stare upward until my neck stiffens and my eyes blur. The world below decays, peeling paint, dripping pipes, stale air, but I don’t care. I eat when my body makes me. I sleep only when exhaustion takes over me.

I try to write it down, to capture her voice before it slips from me, but I’m not an author, and I can’t write words like I can think thoughts. She spoke as if she carried every sorrow I have ever known. As if she were not a stranger at all, but the answer to a question I never knew I had been asking. The sound of her lingers, like a thread pulled taut inside my skull.

I have walked this rooftop until my shoes wore thin. Gripped the railing until my palms split. Whispered to the sky until my throat bled dry. Some nights I laugh, some nights I weep, and some nights I do both until dawn stains the buildings with light. I never hear her, but always, I am listening.

Was it a vision? A hallucination? I don’t know. I am certain of this: if the mouth opens again, if her voice calls to me, I will follow without hesitation. Let the teeth close around me, let the darkness swallow me whole. When she called, I was no longer alone. I would surrender everything just to feel that belonging again.

Tonight I wait yet again. The rooftop is cold beneath me, gravel and broken glass pressing into my legs as I sit by the edge. The air is damp, heavy with the smell of rain yet to fall. The city hums faintly below, a distant sea of machines and muted voices. A lone streetlight flickers on the corner, its glow weak and dying, painting the brick walls around me in sickly yellow. The railing is rusted, streaked with years of weather and neglect, but I clutch it as though it anchors me to this place. My fingers are trembling. My chest feels hollow, stretched thin like paper that might tear at any moment. The night wind whispers against my skin, but it does not cool me; I am consumed by a hunger I cannot name.

I tilt my head back and stare until my eyes water, searching the black ceiling above for the smile that once opened there. Every flicker of lightning, every shifting cloud, sets my heart racing as though I might hear her again. My whole being waits, aching, desperate, for a voice that may never return. Still, I cannot leave. 

The night gives me nothing. Hours pass in silence, measured only by the red blink of a radio tower in the distance and the ache growing in my spine. My eyes sting from the strain of searching, but I cannot look away, not until the first pale smear of light seeps across the horizon. Dawn comes reluctantly. The sky does not open. The sky does not smile. She does not call.

At last, the city exhales. Cars groan in the streets below, doors slam, footsteps echo across cracked pavement. Their world resumes as if nothing had happened. I know what I heard, I know what I saw. I linger at the railing until the sun is fully risen, washing the teeth of the skyline in dull fire. A deep, muted pain spreads through my chest. Hope curdles into shame, weariness, the quiet dread that perhaps tonight will be no different, nor the night after, nor the night after that.

I descend. The fire escape groans under my weight, cold and damp with dew. I count the steps like a prayer, each one heavier than the last, until my feet meet the rotted landing of my floor. The hallway smells of rust and mildew, the wallpaper curled back like old scabs. My apartment waits behind a warped door, still and suffocating.

Inside, the air is stale, thick with the odor of dust, damp fabric, and long-unwashed clothes. Light struggles through the blinds, pale stripes across the floor littered with notebooks and loose pages. My writing clings to every surface. Rambling lines, frantic sketches of mouths and teeth. I step carefully between them, as though they are relics, sacred fragments of what I am trying to hold on to.

I sink into the mattress, lying crooked on the floor. The sheets are tangled, damp with old sweat. I close my eyes, though I know sleep will not come easily. The silence of the room presses on me, louder than the city outside. I wait for her voice to follow me into dreams. I pray that it does.



The silence does not break. It is heavy, a black liquid pouring into the room until it fills my ears, my lungs, my skull. I haven’t moved. The same stripes of sunlight lay across the floor, painting the scattered notebooks and loose pages in a faded, grotesque light. The stale air tastes of dust and decay, a flavor I’ve come to know better than anything else.

​My mind is a maelstrom of disappointment and rage. The memory of what happened is a brand on my soul, a reminder of a hope that was nothing but a hallucination. I fell for it. I fell for it with a desperation that now sickens me. My voice, when I finally use it, is quiet, almost tender.

​“You see this?” I say to the empty air, the space I imagine she inhabits. “This is where I live.”

​I get up and walk to the small television in the corner, its screen black and dusty. “This is my TV. It’s busted, but it works.” I grab a flash drive from a tangled pile of wires and plug it in. “It’s got all my favorite movies on here. I downloaded them, so we don’t need an internet connection. See?” I turn it on. The screen flickers to life, a familiar title card appearing.

​My mind is screaming. It was a lie. A lie told to a man already on the edge. I want to smash the TV, tear the notebooks, scream until my throat bleeds. I don’t. I point to the notebooks scattered on the floor.

​“Those are for you,” I say, my voice a soft murmur. “I’ve been writing it all down. So you’ll know everything about me.” My voice catches. “I’m sorry they didn’t turn out better. It’s hard to draw from memory.”

​A new energy courses through me, cold and final. I’ve wasted weeks, months, rambling in my filthy apartment. I can’t keep doing this. I have abandoned everything. I lost my job, my few friends, and my sanity. No one is here to help me. Everything I have ever cared for is gone. I don’t know what day it is today, or how long this has been going on. Long enough for the apartment to mold over, long enough for me to become completely isolated from the outside world, physically and emotionally. The air in this dusty apartment is choking me. I have to go back outside.

​I climb the fire escape, the iron groaning under my weight. The sun is a pale, cold orb, washing out the city's colors. The roof is exactly as I left it: gritty, stained with grime. I don’t clutch the railing. I walk past it, to the very edge, to the low parapet wall. I stare down at the street below, the cars, the people like tiny, oblivious ants, the world moving on. It's so far down.

​I talk to the darkness. "You know, this is it,” I say, my voice still gentle. "This is the end of the wait.”

​My mind whispers. Just lean forward. Let go. This time, there will be no false hope, no smiling sky, no voice that whispers lies. Just an end to the waiting. A final silence.

​I step onto the low stone wall. The wind rushes against my face, pulling at my hair, but I feel nothing. My hands are steady. My heart is a stone. ​I close my eyes. I can almost feel the air rushing past my body, the moment just before impact. The end is so close. I just have to fall. One step, and it could all be over for good.

Are there things to live for? Sure. I have my own house, food to eat, and television to watch. I can make new friends. What I can not do, however, is forget. Forget about that night, forget about staring into the mouth of something bigger than myself. Bigger than anything I have ever known. Something cosmic. It drives every waking moment of my life, and terrorizes me while I sleep. I need to get this over with. I can’t grow. I can’t change. Nobody is going to save me.

​I hear a whisper. Not in the sky, but from my own head. Faint, but clear. A girl’s voice. A single, impossible word, the sound of my name. It says, “Ren.”

The sound unravels me. I stagger back from the ledge, nearly tripping over the gravel. My lungs are heaving as though I’ve been underwater for hours and only now broken the surface. Her voice is thin as silk, quivering at the edges, but it is real. Real in the way nothing else has been for months.

“It’s you,” I whisper, though the word claws my throat. “You’re real.”

“Yes.”

That single word anchors me harder than the railing ever could. My knees give, and I drop against the cracked stone, pressing my forehead to it. I laugh, broken, humorless.

Silence follows, and I think I’ve scared her off, or worse, that I’ve imagined it again. Then she says, low and steady, “You must keep going.”

That's all I wanted to hear. The idea of somebody wanting me to continue was enough for me to break through my clouded thoughts. “Just don’t leave me alone again. Please.”

Her voice comes softer this time. “I won’t.”

…

The next morning, I wake in a pile of crumpled notebooks and stale air. For a brief, perfect instant, I think the rooftop was a dream.

“Ren.”

Her voice cuts through the silence, low and toneless, but it seizes me like a hand around the ribs. I sit upright, hair sticking to my forehead, eyes burning.

“You’re still here.”

“Yes.” A pause. Then, as plainly as if she’s commenting on the weather: “Your room smells like rot.”

I glance around at the battlefield of instant noodle cups, mummified shirts in the corner, and a streak of something unidentifiable on the wall. “That’s what you woke me up for?”

“It is unhealthy,” she replies. “Clean it.”

I blink. “What?”

“Clean your room.”

For a moment, I just stare upward at the cracked ceiling as if her voice is carved into it. “This is what I was waiting for? Chores?”

“Yes.”

“Right,” I mutter, dragging myself to my feet. My joints ache like they’ve aged decades overnight. “Fine.”

So I begin.

I start with the cups. They collapse when I touch them, brittle styrofoam shells flaking apart, leaving greasy rings on the floor. I bag them, one by one. The air grows clearer. A patch of floor reveals itself beneath the detritus, pale linoleum I’d half-forgotten existed.

Every so often, I glance toward the window, where sunlight sneaks in between the blinds. I half expect her to disappear. But each time I falter, her voice is calm, cool, and insistent.

“Keep going.”

“You missed one.”

“Now, fold the clothes.”

She doesn’t laugh. She doesn’t sigh. She just guides me. In the strangest way, that’s worse than silence.

By evening, I’m standing amid piles of laundry, sweat streaking my face, my throat itching from muttering commentary to myself. I lift my arms toward the ceiling, triumphant. “All done!”

A pause. Then, almost imperceptibly, “Better.”

For the first time in months, I smile. That night, I sat on the mattress with an open notebook, staring at the half-cleaned room. I feel something I haven’t in a long time. A pulse. A flicker. The beginning of a life that means something. It all started because a voice in the sky told me to clean my room.

The next morning, her voice wakes me again.

“Ren.”

It’s strange how fast I’ve grown used to it. I roll over on the mattress, groaning into the sheets. “You’re becoming an alarm clock.”

“You need money,” she says.

I look up at the ceiling. “Money?”

“Yes.”

I rub my face. My palm comes away gritty. “The apartment is abandoned. I don’t really have any bills to pay.”

“You need food. Not just noodles. Real food.”

“Fine dining?”

“Might seem that way to you. Do food deliveries.”

I stare at the notebooks scattered across the floor. A long, brittle moment passes. “You’re telling me to get a job.”

“Yes.”

“Do you even know what a job is?”

“Yes.”

“Uh-huh.” I drag myself upright, hair sticking to my forehead. “And you picked the most humiliating one possible.”

“Well, you have to eat,” she says.

Today, she doesn’t sound so cold. Even if just slightly, it seems she is concerned about me.

That afternoon, I borrowed an old bike from a neighbor who’s too drunk to remember owning it. The tires hiss against the wet sidewalk, the chain shrieks with every turn. I opened a delivery app on my phone and set out.

The city air tastes like exhaust and rain. My legs burn before I’ve even gone a block. Every car horn feels like a personal attack. By the third delivery, I’m dripping sweat, trying to balance a bag of curry on one handlebar while trying not to die in traffic. A car brushes too close. I scream a curse so shrill that a flock of pigeons erupts overhead.

That night, back on the roof, I told her everything.

“I did it,” I announce, collapsing against the railing, chest still aching. “I made seventy dollars today.”

There’s silence, and for a terrifying moment, I think she won’t respond. Finally:

“Did you eat?”

I groan, dragging a hand down my face. “Yeah, I stopped and got a burger on the way home. So really, I only made fifty dollars. ”

“That’s okay. As long as you made something.”

“Yeah, I did. Not much, but it’s better than nothing.”

Another pause. Then, softer: “I'm proud of you.”

The words hit harder than a punch. My throat closes. My eyes sting. I tip my head back and let the night spin above me. “Thank you,” I whisper. 

Weeks went on like this. The time I spent with her was both healing and heartbreaking. I felt like she knew me, watching everything I did. I know nothing about her. She doesn’t remember. Any time I ask her questions, her name, where she's from, how she even got eaten in the first place, she doesn’t remember. Despite this, slowly, her personality has started to peek through all the gloom.

“Ren.”

I groan and roll over, pressing my face into the mattress like I was trying to fuse with the sheets. “Yes?”

“You should go to the gym.”

I sit up. “Go to the gym?” I echo. “Why?”

“I think you would feel better, and probably make food deliveries a lot easier in the long run.”

I glare at the ceiling, or rather the space where I imagine her observing me. “Yeah, that's true. I just don’t want to.”

“You have to.”

“I have to?” I whisper, dreading the whole idea.

“Get your stuff and go,” she says. Flat. Precise.

I drag myself upright, brushing crumbs off my shoulder. “Of course. The gym.”

“Get going”

I rub my face. “Fine”

By noon, I’m standing outside a gym that reeks of hand sanitizer, sweat, and chlorine. I pay the membership fee, spending almost a whole day's worth of deliveries. I complain, she doesn’t comment.

The locker room is loud with echoing grunts, shrieks, and old men showering. I pick a locker and drop my bag inside.

“Where do I start?” I mutter to myself, voice bouncing off the tall ceilings.

“First, stretch, then lift something.”

I glance around. Everyone here looks capable, alive in a way that feels like a personal indictment. I don’t know what I'm doing here. I pick up a dumbbell, testing its weight with the finesse of someone who has never touched anything heavier than a grocery bag of instant noodles. It tilts awkwardly in my grip.

“This is going well,” I whisper. The dumbbell wobbles.

“Do not speak to it. Focus.”

I set it down. Focus. I tried a bench press. The bar seems to weigh as much as a car. One, two, three reps. My arms tremble violently. I look up. She’s silent. She is judging.

“This is embarrassing,” she finally says.

I lie on the bench and stare at the ceiling tiles. “Do you lift many weights up there?”

Minutes pass. Sweat gathers in places I didn’t know existed. My lungs feel like they’re filled with wet sand. I continue because she will not stop making fun of me if I quit.

“You got this,” she says.

I look at the bar. It is a threat. “Right.”

Half an hour later, my muscles are screaming in a language I understand as anger and betrayal. I stagger to the treadmill, pretending I know what I’m doing. I set it at a speed that feels reasonable and instantly regret it. My legs pound like they’ve been replaced by lead pipes.

“You run weird,” she comments.

I glare at the ceiling. “It’s harder when someone is watching.”

“I’ve already looked away.”

The rest of the session is a blur of flailing limbs, misjudged weights, and an argument with a jump rope that insists on tangling around my ankles. By the time I collapse onto a bench near the exit, soaked through, I whisper, “Well. That wasn’t so bad.”

“I had a good time. I think that is enough.”

I press my palms to my face, feeling the grease and sweat cling. “Enough for what?”

“To reward yourself,” she says.

I lift my head. “Reward?”

“Something fun. You have earned it.”

I stare at the ceiling, at the stark white lights buzzing overhead. “What’s this reward?”

“How about a movie?” she says.

“Movie?”

“Yeah. There’s always something to watch.”

“I haven’t been to the movies in a while. People look at you funny when you go alone.”

“You’re not.”

Later, we sat in the theater, the room swallowing us whole. The darkness is almost tangible, pooling around my shoulders and settling in the pit of my stomach. The faint scent of buttered popcorn hits my senses with an alarming sharpness, reminding me that life’s best pleasures are usually very simple.

I glance at her, the presence above, the impossible voice that seems to float somewhere just beyond my perception. She is quiet, observing with the same certainty she always carries, and I realize I’ve stopped bracing for her judgment.

The movie begins. Shadows move across the screen, faces contorted, laughter and terror blurred together. I try to focus, but the exhaustion from the gym weighs in my chest, presses against my ribs like a slow, deliberate hand.

“You are silent,” she says.

“People don’t talk in movies, especially to themselves,” I reply. “Also, I’m full of popcorn.”

She does not respond, but I feel her attention like a weight beside me. Not threatening. Warm, comfortable.

The film ends. We sit in the thick, slow exhale of air-conditioned darkness. The credits roll, white letters sliding across the black screen. My legs ache, my arms tremble. Beneath it all, I feel a pulse of warmth, a fragile thread that has nothing to do with the theater and everything to do with her presence.

“Did you like the movie?” I ask.

“I had fun,” she replies.

I tilt my head back, staring at the pitch black ceiling I know is above the theater, but somehow feels infinite. “That sounds like you didn’t.”

The lights come on. The theater exits around us. I rise, stiff and groaning, and for the first time, I imagine her voice beside me, not as an echo in the sky, but as a tether keeping me from falling.

The next morning, my muscles complain before my eyes even open. Every joint feels like it’s been sanded down to bare bone. I lift my head from the mattress, grimace at the pale lines of sunlight cutting across the room, and immediately hear it:

“Good morning”

“Good morning,” I groan, dragging myself upright, hair sticking to my face in greasy strands. My arms ache so badly that holding them up to rub my eyes is a minor feat of endurance.	

“You should cook something,” she says.

I freeze. “I don't really know how to do that.”

“I'll help you. Let's make Alfredo”

“Alfredo?”

“Yes.”

I let my head fall back against the wall. “I don't have any ingredients for that”

“Then we will go to the store,” she says.

I groan and rub at my face. “Alright, let's do it.”

Later, we leave the apartment, the city yawning before us, gray and wet with the remnants of last night’s rain. I push the bike through streets that smell of diesel, wet asphalt, and garbage, and she guides me in her quiet, insistent way. She names the ingredients: heavy cream, parmesan, butter, garlic, a particular brand of pasta I wouldn’t have found in a hundred lifetimes.

I carry the basket like a man lugging a body bag. Every passing pedestrian is an accusation. Somewhere beneath it all, I feel the pulse of absurdity, shopping with a voice in the sky.

Back at the apartment, I set up in the kitchen.

“Do you stir clockwise or counterclockwise?” I ask, joking.

“Just stir it.”

I laugh dryly, the sound hollow but real. “Helpful as always.”

Minutes pass in a rhythm of chopping, boiling, stirring. I curse under my breath when cream splashes, when the pasta threatens to boil over, when I misjudge the heat and the sauce clings to the bottom of the pan.

Finally, the pasta is done. The sauce is creamy, glistening under the harsh kitchen light. I taste it, expecting ruin. It is perfect. The garlic bites just enough, the parmesan melts into a frightening richness.

I carry a plate to the living room and sit down on the couch. “Eat.”

I sit below her, fork trembling in my hand. The first bite was the best thing I had tasted in a long time. I swallow. Then another bite. Then another, slower this time, as though prolonging the act could extend the happiness the meal gives me.

“I like it,” I say finally, the words almost awkward in the quiet apartment. “I like it a lot.”

Her reply is softer than usual. “Good.”

I smile, pasta sauce all over my lips. “Let’s watch a movie. We earned it.”

I grab the old flash drive, turn the TV on, and sit back. The screen turns on, flashing light fills the room. The smell of cream and butter lingers. Outside, the city hums. For the first time in months, I feel the quiet weight of normalcy, a small tether holding me to the world.

“Ren,”

“Yes?” I say, fork in hand, eyes on the flickering screen.

“How are you holding up?”

I take a moment to think. “Better. I appreciate you being here for me.”

She does not answer. I sense her presence closer, almost approving. I take another bite of Alfredo and sink into the darkness of the living room.

For now, this is enough. I sit on the edge of the couch, a half-eaten plate of Alfredo at my side. The rich, creamy smell swirls around the room. The air is thick with dust, lit by the fading afternoon sunlight streaking through the cracked blinds. The apartment feels smaller than ever, even though it is the cleanest it’s ever been.

“Ren,” she says, her voice low, insistent, hovering somewhere above the peeling plaster of the ceiling.

“Yes?” My voice is hoarse, swallowed by the stale air.

“You need to stay inside tonight.”

I lift my head. “Inside? Why?”

“He’s looking for you,” she says simply. “the god above. It will wake. It will stir. It will seek to swallow you.”

I blink at the ceiling, at the cracked plaster, at the faint shadow of sunlight on the floor. My stomach twists. “Swallow me?”

“Yes.”

I choke on the noodles. “I always come out to talk to you at night.”

Her voice, flat and certain, fills the apartment. “Not tonight. You need to stay inside until I know for sure He is gone.”

I stand abruptly, knocking the plate to the floor. Alfredo spills, noodles sliding across the worn linoleum like pale worms writhing in slow motion. The smell of butter mixes with dust. “What about you? Maybe I can see you if he does swallow me.” My voice breaks. “Or maybe you can come down here.”

“Maybe,” she says. “But it's too big of a risk.”

My hands shake. The city beyond the blinds murmurs faintly: distant traffic, the hum of neon signs, the occasional wailing siren. “Too big of a risk?” I whisper. “You’ve spent so much time with me here, helping me get on my feet. I’m not too worried about the risks.”

“I’d rather you be safe than have this all be for nothing” she says. “Besides, I’ve been trapped here for a while, I’ve gotten used to it.”

My eyes fix on a splatter of cream glistening on the floor. My chest heaves. “I can’t,” I whisper, voice cracking. “I can’t stay in here knowing that there's a chance you could be saved.”

The room is heavy. Dust clings to my hair and skin. The wallpaper peels in curling, brittle strips. The light from the fading sun slashes across the floorboards like knives. I feel the weight of months of isolation, of hope built from broken scraps, slip away.

“I want you to be safe” she says quietly, her voice threading through the stale air.

“No,” I reply, bitter. “I'm not going to stay in and hide.”

I close my eyes. The oppressive silence of the apartment presses against me, mingling with the distant hum of the city outside. The smell of butter and garlic, the grime, the cracked floor, it all feels like a trap, a world built to remind me of my own fragility. Beneath the fear, beneath the despair, a spark ignites. Not hope. Not comfort. Something sharper, desperate, unrelenting.

I rise, trembling at the shadows gathering in corners, at the faint smear of sunlight on the ceiling. Her silence fills the room like a pressure pressing down on my skull. “Ren,” she says finally, almost pleading. “You need to stay inside.”

I grip the edge of the couch, knuckles white, eyes darting to the city beyond the blinds, gray, cold, indifferent. Neon signs flicker in puddles on the street. Trash drifts past the curb, carried on wind that smells of rust. “I can’t,” I say, voice hollow but resolute. “I can’t wait anymore. I’m going to you.”

I feel the weight of my decision pressing down, heavy and inevitable. The mouth waits. Somewhere above, she waits too. I step toward the door. The latch clicks. The swollen door drags against the frame as I pull it open, releasing a stale gust of hallway air. The apartment exhales behind me.

The stairwell feels colder than the street outside, as though the building itself resents my departure. Each step groans, wooden ribs shifting under my weight. Wallpaper curls in strips from the plaster, peeling like sunburned skin. The handrail is sticky, coated with grime from decades of unwashed hands.

Halfway down, I pause. My heart is hammering already, my body urging me to turn back, to sink into the chair by the cold Alfredo and wait like a coward.

Then I hear it, the faintest sound in the distance, too low to be the wind, too deep to be the hum of pipes. A vibration in my bones, like something vast rolling over in its sleep.

The mouth is stirring.

I keep walking.

The city greets me with silence at first. A false silence, full of weight and watching. The air is heavy, damp, metallic, like standing too close to a storm drain. Streetlamps flicker, their halos dimmed to weak rings. Neon signs flare and gutter in the distance, their letters scrambled into nonsense. The pavement beneath my bare feet is slick, warm in places, as though pulsing faintly with something alive beneath. Trash drifts in the gutter, plastic bags, cigarette cartons, the bloated carcass of something unidentifiable. Above, the clouds writhe.

They do not move like clouds should. They don’t drift or scatter. They churn inward, folding over themselves, dragging light down into their spiral. They are the skin of something larger, pressed thin against the atmosphere. Veins bulge faintly in their darkness. At times I think I see the twitch of a lip behind them, as if the entire sky is a mask stretched too tight over a waiting grin.

My chest feels hollow. The air is hard to breathe.

“Ren.”

Her voice threads itself into the neon buzz of the storefront beside me, into the rattling of a loose sign above the abandoned bus stop. It is everywhere, and it is pleading.

“Go back.”

I shake my head. My throat feels tight. “I can’t.”

The air trembles, though whether from her sigh or the shift of the sky I can’t tell.

I take another step forward.

The further I walk, the worse the city becomes.

Storefronts gape with shattered windows, their displays left to decay, mannequins collapsed like corpses, fruit black with mold, shoes curling and stiff with mildew. A bus sits crumpled at the corner, its frame bent as though squeezed by an unseen hand. Inside, the seats glisten wetly with something dark.

The air thickens with each block. The hum in my bones grows louder. My skin prickles. The lamps overhead sputter and die one by one, leaving me in stretches of blind dark broken only by flickers of neon. I keep moving, though my legs ache, every step feels like walking into the open throat of something waiting to devour me. All the while, I feel her, closer, nearer, her voice brushing against my ear though her body is nowhere in sight.

“You do not understand what it will do to you.”

“I don’t care,” I whisper, the words torn raw from my lungs. “If it swallows me, fine. At least I’ll be closer to you.”

Her silence stabs sharper than any answer.

Then the sky splits.

At first, only a seam, a thin fissure running from one horizon to the other. It glows faintly, a flesh membrane stretched to breaking. Then it tears, lips peeling back, gums ridged and slick with spit.	

The mouth yawns open.

I cannot move.

It is not sky anymore, not clouds or stars. It is flesh, it is darkness, it is teeth, mile-high towers of ivory, each ridged and wet, catching the glint of lightning that flares within. Spittle falls in long cords, hissing into vapor before it strikes the ground. The air rushes inward, dragging the world with it.

The sound is worse than the sight. It is the groan of continents shifting, the gurgle of oceans emptied, the whisper of ten thousand voices at once threading themselves into my skull. My knees buckle. My palms slap wet pavement as my vision swims. My stomach heaves.

Somewhere within the cacophony, her voice rises, thin, trembling, almost breaking.

“Ren. Stop. Please.”

I rise to my feet. I lift my head into the storm, into the pull that claws at my hair, my clothes, my skin. “I won’t stop.” My throat tears around the words. “I’d rather be torn apart with you than stay behind without you.”

The mouth widens. Its breath surges, and my body begins to lift. My feet skid against the pavement, then leave it altogether. The city tilts below me.

I reach upward. The first pull is subtle. My hair lifts, my shirt clings to my ribs, and I feel the lurch in my stomach like a sudden elevator drop. I claw at the pavement, fingers scraping against wet stone, but the street is already sliding away beneath me.

The air howls inward. Trash barrels tumble past, lids rattling like drums. Newspapers spiral up, pages flapping like the wings of frantic birds before they vanish into the black seam above. A stop sign wrenches loose from its bolts, metal squealing as it lifts past me, spinning end over end into the sky.

I rise.

Below, the city convulses. Whole blocks buckle, torn loose at their roots. Windows shatter outward, spilling glass like showers of stars. Buildings tilt into each other, their skeletons groaning as bricks rain down. The streets split, asphalt peeled upward like the rind of an overripe fruit.

All of it, every stone, every wire, every body, surges upward, drawn into the grin above. My ears ring with pressure. My eyes stream. My lungs heave as though the air itself has turned against me. I thrash against it, though there’s nothing to hold, nothing to fight.

Her voice.

“Ren.”

The syllable is fragile, trembling, but it steadies me. I twist upward, blinking against the torrent of wind and dust. There she is. Suspended in the darkness, just beyond the jagged line of teeth.

Her body floats, a figure carved from pale light, her hair drifting in slow motion as though underwater. Her arms are limp at her sides. Her eyes are wide, unblinking, fixed on me. She is close enough to see but impossibly far, as though the Mouth itself stretches the space between us. The sight of her guts me. A sob claws out of my throat, ripped away by the wind before it can reach her. I scream, though my voice is shredded.

Her lips part, barely moving, but the sound blooms inside my skull: Stop.

The word is soft, but it cuts deeper than the tearing of the world around me. The pull strengthens. My spine wrenches, my body whipped like a rag. Blood floods my mouth from somewhere deep in my chest. My fingernails split against nothing as I claw at the air.

The city breaks beneath me. I see the bus that once sat at the corner wrenched skyward, its seats spilling loose like teeth from a jaw. A fire hydrant spins past me, its broken pipe spraying a ribbon of water that arcs upward until it dissolves. A building shears away from its foundation, concrete groaning, and the people inside, some alive, some limp, are pulled screaming from its windows, their bodies snapping and flailing as they vanish above.

The smell is unbearable. Burnt wires, ruptured sewage, gasoline split open and atomized. The air tastes like metal and garbage, heavy with the perfume of things that should never mix. My stomach lurches violently. Bile scorches my throat.

Still, I rise. Something tears inside me. Not flesh. Not bone. Deeper. It begins as a hot thread pulling taut behind my sternum. Then another. Then dozens. My breath catches; my chest spasms. I feel myself unraveling, not in skin, not in blood, but in essence. My soul is being dragged out.

Each strand of it burns as it’s pulled free, white-hot threads tugged loose from marrow and nerve. My body convulses, choking on the absence. My vision fractures, flickering in and out of clarity. My heartbeat stumbles, erratic, useless. I scream, though no sound escapes. Only the tearing does. My arms thrash, reaching for her silhouette as she hovers in the air beyond the teeth. Her eyes widen, her lips shaping words I cannot hear over the roar of the Mouth.

You will break.

The phrase bursts in my mind, not spoken but carved directly into it.

The mouth groans wider.

The sound is unbearable, mountains splitting, oceans boiled dry, the shriek of worlds torn from orbit. My skin ripples against it, every hair bristling. The city shrinks below. Buildings are no longer towers but toys, spiraling upward in chunks to vanish into the black. The streets are gone, swallowed. Only a patchwork of flames remains, trembling like a dying hearth.

She moves. Her arms rise, slow and weightless, drifting toward me. Her face, pale and strained, softens. My ribs ache as another strand of myself tears loose, the pain so sharp I nearly black out. I force my eyes open, force myself to see her. She is close now, so close I can make out the faint cracks in her lips, the thin shadows beneath her eyes, the tremble of her fingers as she reaches. I reach back, my arm shaking violently, every tendon screaming. My chest convulses with another soul-thread ripped free, but I push through it. My hand stretches.

Impossibly, we touch. Her skin is cold. Colder than stone, colder than death, but it is real beneath my fingers. I seize her wrist. She flinches at the contact, startled by the force of it, then clutches me back, her grip trembling but desperate. The relief is shattering. My throat breaks on a sob, tears streaming upward from my eyes into the wind. “I found you,” I rasp, though my voice is nothing but air. Her face crumples. Her grip tightens.

It is not done. 

The pull grows violent, a storm beyond storms. My body whips sideways, spine twisting, bones creaking with the strain. I cry out, clinging to her arm, terrified I’ll lose her again.

My body is no longer mine. It jerks downward, limp, dragged like a corpse into the maw. My head snaps back; my jaw unhinges. My skin pales as color drains from it. I watch, horrified, as the shell of myself, my husk, falls away, dangling lifeless as it’s swallowed.

I am no longer in it. I am the pain, the unraveling, the scream stretched thin into nothing. I am the threads torn loose, spilling into her grip, into her arms. Still, she holds me.

Her other arm winds around me, fragile but unyielding. She pulls me against her chest, clutching me as if her frail body could shield me from the god above. Her hair lashes across my face, tasting of ash and rain. I bury my face into her shoulder, sobbing with no breath, burning with no body. 

Around us, the mouth closes. The world shrinks to teeth. They rise on all sides, walls of bone and enamel stretching higher than skyscrapers, ridged with veins of spit and shadow. The jaws close inch by inch, grinding together with a noise so vast it pierces marrow. Sparks fall between the teeth like shooting stars, sizzling against the black.

The void swells between them, blacker than any night I’ve known. It swallows distance, sound, the memory of streets and buildings. Even my own body feels like a rumor in this place, something half-believed.

Her arms are the only thing holding me in shape. Even they tremble. Even she flickers, as though this darkness is trying to erase her too. Her hair floats upward, strands unraveling into smoke at the edges. When I look at her face too long, the outlines waver, collapsing into ash before snapping back again. The pull grows worse. It isn’t just physical anymore. It tugs at what I am.

At first it feels like a bruise pressed too hard. Then like a seam splitting. Then like my ribs opening from the inside, pried apart with invisible hands. Something warm, luminous, and unspeakably fragile peels out of me, thin threads of light, snapping free one after the other. I convulse against her. My jaw locks. Her grip hardens. For a second, I feel her nails break my skin. Not cruelly. Desperately.

The next tear rips free. It is not bone. Not muscle. It is the tether that kept me together all these years, the hidden line no surgeon can see. When it unravels, heat floods out of me in a river. My body goes slack, sagging against her like an emptied husk. The world tilts. My vision warps. Neon ghosts flicker in the void. Streets I once walked, nights I once wasted, faces long buried. They bleed into one another like paint on wet canvas, melting, erased.

In the center of it all, her eyes remain. Despite me being in her arms, she still radiates loneliness. The same loneliness that carved holes in me, that left me staring at ceilings until dawn, that drove me into her voice the first time I heard it. She is hollow in the same way. Hollow enough to need someone, even if it destroys them both. I press my forehead to hers. My lips crack, blood running into my mouth. The words splinter in the dark. “You’re not alone anymore.”

The void trembles. Each strand that tears loose from me bleeds into her. I feel it, a seepage, a transfer, sparks burrowing into her chest where our bodies meet. Her shoulders jerk with each one. Her lips part in sharp gasps. She shakes her head weakly, her arms tighten. She won’t release me.

The last thread breaks. It is not pain. It is absence. A silence so vast I nearly dissolve into it. My chest caves inward, hollow. My eyes roll back. My body sags uselessly in her embrace. I am not gone. I am with her.

I hear the small, shaking whisper:

You found me.

The mouth fully closes, sealing us inside bone and black. As far as I am concerned, the city is already gone. The world with it. There is nothing left but this embrace, this terrible union inside the jaws of an unknown being. For the first time, the dark feels almost warm.

We break from each other's arms. Sitting with our backs against the teeth, we stare inward. Deep down the throat, something stirs. We look at each other, unable to speak. We hear a deep, booming voice shatter through the dark. One voice, spoken by two. Man and woman speak together. It says,

“It is time for the digestion of the soul.”
