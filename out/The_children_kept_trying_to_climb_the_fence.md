In 2005 I was a student teacher at an elementary school close to my university. I didn’t want to leave my apartment or the college town I had grown to love, and despite my parents begging me to come home for the final semester; I had found a placement twenty minutes from my apartment.

It was a new school. Well, new construction. The school was called Oakbriar Elementary. For safety reasons I won’t mention the state. The name has changed so even if you decide to Google this place you probably won’t find it.

It was a beautiful new school. It was all new brick, tans and oranges that contrasted nicely with the large, wooded forest it bordered. The playground was new and had never been played in. The students hadn’t run through the halls, not yet.

I thought it was fitting. A brand-new school for a brand-new would-be teacher. I was nervous that first day when I walked into Mrs. Greers 4^(th) grade classroom. I still remember how all those kids looked at me like it was Christmas. Someone so new, and still young. Though to a 4^(th) grader I think everyone looks old.

They were all so sweet. All eager to learn and tell me about their summers. Any nerves I had at the beginning of the day were gone by the end of it. It had been replaced with a certainty that I had chosen the right profession.

Things didn’t start to get weird until the second week of classes. The weather was still very hot and I was in charge of watching the kids at recess. I actually loved it, being outside in the sunshine was just as much of a treat for me as it was the kids.

“Ms. Porter! Ms. Porter! Derrick is trying to climb over the fence!” a little ran up to me frantic, her eyes wide and pointing to the chain link fence that circled the playground.

I looked up and there was Derrick, a boy from my class desperately trying to climb over the chain-link fence. He was halfway up but had frozen when he heard his name being called.

He looked back at me with the wide eyes of a caught deer before frantically scrambling back down again.

I walked over calmly and confronted him, even as he looked down sheepishly.

“Derrick. We all went over school safety rules, and we all know that you can’t climb the fence. It can be dangerous, and we’re all supposed to stay on the playground.”

“I’m sorry Ms. Porter. I heard singing from the woods and someone was calling my name. I thought it might be a teacher,” he said pointing at the woods behind the playground.

The lie was so blatant, but I still found myself turning to the woods and listening for a few seconds. Nothing besides some bird song and the sounds of students playing on the playground.

“There’s nothing there Derrick. Even if someone was calling your name you couldn’t go into the woods or climb the fence. It’s dangerous. And no teacher would call for you like that, they know it’s dangerous too,” I said with as much sternness as I was able to muster. Which was not a lot for a twenty-two-year-old, but I managed.

“I’m sorry Ms. Porter,” Derrick said once again before running off into the playground. We still had fifteen more minutes of playtime before Math lessons and music.

I didn’t think anything more of it. And I didn’t mention it to Mrs. Greer either, I needed to handle these kids on my own. Attempting to climb the fence seemed like a minor offense anyway.

But the next day at recess more children tried to climb over the fence. Five children this time, three boys and two girls; only two of them I knew because they were in my classes. No one had to come running to tell me that someone was climbing over the fence, because this time I had been on the lookout in case Derrick tried again.

Derrick wasn’t even among the children this time. I ran up just in time as Savannah, a little pig tailed girl from my class, reached the top and swung a leg over. I grabbed her and pulled her back. Her stockings caught on the chain-link and she let out an indignant scream.

“Ms. Porter you tore my stocking!” she shrieked.

“Savannah! You could have gotten hurt! All of you could have,” I shouted, sounding angrier than I meant too.

I was not mad. I was scared. Seeing a child get hurt is every teacher’s worst nightmare. And in the back of my mind I was worried I’d get in trouble for grabbing a student like I did. Surely, I’d have some angry parents wanting to talk to me.

“I wanted to follow the music! There’s a circus in the forest and we wanted to go see it,” Savannah screamed, her face red and streaked with snot and tears and righteous anger.

“There is no circus in the forest! There’s only trees and squirrels and birds,” I felt my voice raise more than I meant too, I needed to stay calm and this was not calm.

I couldn’t let his one slide, so we had to march back into the classroom, and I had to present Savannah to her teacher like she had been in the middle of a prison break.

Her punishment was no recess for a week, and her parents were called. The girl cried and pouted about how unfair we were. But neither of us were buying the whole, there was a circus in the woods, lie.

But the next day more kids tried to climb the fence. And even more the next day. When Friday ended, I breathed a sigh of relief. I had started to dread recess. For the past few days I’d been standing guard against the would be incursions of the students. Even though I was only a few feet from them they still tried to climb the fence.

That Friday evening the school sent out a campus wide e-mail to staff and parents. It was a kind but firm e-mail detailing the dangers of what could happen if a student managed to climb over the chain-link fence. The woods could be dangerous, you could get hurt climbing etc. etc. and they ended the e-mail letting us all know that any students who did manage to get over the barrier would be promptly suspended for a week.

On Monday we had no students dart to the fence like last week. Over the weekend our janitorial staff had been up “no crossing” signs and those large orange cones that did nothing at all to stop children from climbing if they set their mind to it. It was mostly for show.

The students eyed the makeshift barriers with mixtures of disdain and anger. Each child had a different story as to why they wanted to cross the fence. Some, like Savannah, said they heard a circus. Others said they heard the voices of their parents calling them. Others still said they heard music or animals and wanted to investigate.

We had gone into the woods to look for ourselves, not too far in but enough to know there were no people there. No hidden circus or microphones or animals to be found.

It happened on a Wednesday. The last few days the children had seemingly given up on their plans of escape. Though I was still uneasy. I had heard and seen them whispering, in the classroom and at lunchtime. But every time I came close, they looked away quickly, guiltily, as if they were hiding something.

The sun was bright and the weather pleasant that day, not too warm, a perfect day. I was on recess duty again. Joining me was Mr. Cleeves, the fifth-grade teacher who was old enough to be my father. And Mr. Reyes, a man in his thirties who was part of the custodial staff. He sat near the fence watching the children, and the fence, with a look of pure boredom so intense I felt bad for him.

Even I was letting my guard down. It had been days since anyone had tried anything. Perhaps the threat of suspension was enough to keep them away. Or maybe the bright orange cones were working.

And then the children rushed the fence. In all there were twenty of them, boys and girls, all running for the fence and through the makeshift barriers, climbing the fence.

I ran forward and grabbed two children, one by the back of the shirt and another by a belt.  A boy and a girl, Christopher and Renee, both from my class. They screamed and kicked in my grasp as they tried to free themselves. I screamed, though if it was out of fear or desperation, I wasn’t sure.

Mr. Reyes looked bored for half a second more than he jumped up and charged at the children, roaring like a bull. He had his broom with him, and he held it out in front of him like he was going to hit the children. I found out later that wasn’t the case, he was just trying to scare them. And it worked, a dozen children ran screaming in the opposite direction of the large gown man chasing them down.

Mr. Cleeves looked stunned for a minute before he too ran forward and pulled two children off the fence before they could make it over the top. But four children did make it to the top. Three boys and a girl. Their names were Robert, Emily, Aaron, and Jeffrey. They were up and over the fence and into the woods before we could react.

Once the kids were out of sight in the woods it was like the other kids lost their spirit. They stopped struggling and looked around, as if they were stunned.

We ushered the children inside and alerted the rest of the faculty what had happened. We all went into the woods after the children. Mr. Reyes led us in with his broom in hand, ready to wrangle up the missing children. But we didn’t find them. Parents were called as were the police. The principle had a tight-lipped look about him, as if he knew both his job and the kids safety was on the line.

It quickly turned into a true search. Volunteers were called up along with parents and teachers. We scoured the woods calling out the names of the missing children. None were found. The next day, helicopters and search and rescue dogs were called in, still nothing.

They gave up the search a week later. Hope was already gone. That didn’t stop a few persistent volunteers from keeping it up for another week. From the woods we could hear them calling the names, and it sent chills up my spine.

The principle resigned. There was so much backlash he couldn’t stay in that position. I was worried I’d be asked to leave too, but the parents were more interested in suing the school district than the job of one student teacher.

After that the kids could only play inside the auditorium. None of them tried to run away, it was like the fight had gone out of them. Now they just seemed scared, and I didn’t blame them.

 I was done with my student teaching position that December and I graduated. The school eventually put up a huge fence around the playground, one far too tall for any child to climb. Eventually the school itself was renamed, and the story of the missing children who ran into the woods fell into urban legend, or so I’m told.

I moved away. For the first few years of my teaching career, I moved back home to be near my parents, before eventually moving several times before settling down in the pacific northwest with my husband.

Being a teacher is something that I truly enjoy, and I’ve never regretted becoming one. It took years for the trauma I experienced during my student teaching days to subside. But today all that old trauma resurfaced when one of my students came running up to me during recess.

“Mrs. Bellamy! Mrs. Bellamy! I can hear a circus in the woods outside the playground!”
