I suddenly felt myself sweating. What the fuck? I needed to leave, now. 

As I exited the office, I heard a door creak open. I faced the bedroom door in shock; it was open.

"This is way too creepy I need to leave right now, this is way too fucking creepy," I muttered to myself as I stood in front of the door. I felt transfixed in place. I wanted to go back downstairs but for some reason, my feet would not allow it. It was as if the bedroom itself was compelling me to enter.

I closed my eyes and pushed past the door, hands trembling. 

I opened my eyes to see an ordinary and empty room. I glanced under the bed and looked in the closet, and the bathroom. I felt relief wash over me. No dead bodies! 

I glanced around the room once more to see if maybe there was another note or letter left for me. I frowned, there was nothing. 

"Wait," I snapped back around, there was a small book on the bedside dresser. Maybe that was it!

I approached the dresser and stared at the book. The cover was an aged, unnatural yellow and was adorned with small, burgundy roses. That's when it hit me, this wasn't a book, it was a diary.

I gulped nervously as I picked it up. “You're fine, this is fine. No one is dead and you are fine.” I reassured myself.

As I opened the diary, I noticed Dr. Moskowtiz's name on the inside. I felt a sense of relief, maybe this would give me answers about his whereabouts.

I opened the first page. I squinted at the page. There was nothing... but dates? That was odd. 

I kept turning page after page. Dates were written, or nothing. I suddenly felt very stupid and silly, I had just wasted all this time and-. My trail of thought was interrupted when I read the words on the next page. 

"Dear resident, 

If you are reading this, congratulations! It is too late to save yourself. Don’t panic, I'm not going to hurt you. Indeed, I commend your bravery and resourcefulness. You disobeyed my house rules, found the note, got into my room, and even decided to violate my privacy and read my diary. Actions, however, have consequences. Had you not completed this last step, had you entered my room and then simply left, I would have excused every other violation and left you alone. But, seeing as you didn't do that, now you must pay the price."

The letter ended. I paged through the rest of the diary, was there anything else? There was nothing. 

I left his room, ran downstairs, and locked myself in my room. I held myself in a fetal position and rocked back and forth. I should have run out of the house, I should have called the police, I should have called my parents. But for some reason, I couldn't. All I could do was hold myself, cry, and rock slowly. After a few minutes, I heard a door unlock. 

My heart pounded so loudly that I thought I was going to die. I stopped breathing. 

"Hello," a man called out. "I know you're here."

That's when I heard his footsteps come closer. I immediately hid under the covers of my bed and breathed heavily. "I don't want to die, I don't want to die!" I said in between sobs. 

I quieted as his footsteps became louder and then stopped. I held my breath. Suddenly, I heard the doorknob for my room unlock and turn.

I covered my eyes and continued crying. "Please, don't hurt me. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!"

A long minute passed in silence. I relaxed for a moment and then felt the covers being torn off of me. I blinked as tears and snot continued flowing and I looked up at the man before me.

He smiled at me and held out his hand, "Hello, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Moskowitz."

I did not reciprocate and continued staring.

"I apologize if my letter frightened you. You see, that's part of the process. The letter weeds weak people out. But you stayed.”

"Weak?" I croaked out, incredulous.

He smiled ear to ear and patted my shoulder gently. "Yes dear, you are not weak. Not at all."

"W-what do you want?" I stared at him in terror, "With me?" 

He returned the stare and I almost forgot how to breathe as his dark brown eyes bore into me. "You will see, in due time. But for now, let's not have this atmosphere between us. Have dinner with me."

I was petrified. I wanted to keep crying and ask questions, but what if that made me weak? What would happen?

I buried my face in my hands and exhaled. "Okay."

"Take this," he handed me a tissue and chuckled.

"Oh... thanks."

I didn't like the way he was so nonchalant. I had every reason to be scared. He expected me to react this way, but his friendliness was making me feel insane. 

"Clean yourself up, dear. Dinner will be ready in about a half hour. Dress appropriately."

I felt myself blush. Were those orders? They didn't sound like polite requests.

I scrambled to find a nice dress shirt and dress pants. Whatever outfit felt most presentable, whatever outfit felt fitting to plead for my life in.

That's when it hit me. Did he want me to wear something... enticing? I flushed further at the thought. I didn't have any clothes a man would find sexy. But he could see what I looked like, knew my pronouns were they/them, and still did all of this, so, I supposed it didn’t matter.

I wondered briefly if he had some sort of fetish for LGBT people and then put the thought out of my head. Maybe it wasn't like that at all. Maybe he wanted to experiment on me or something. Maybe this was just the beginning of a sick game. I screamed silently to myself, what would that entail? I didn't know but felt a bile rise in my throat. What was his game?

"Dinner's ready!" Dr. Moskowitz called from the other room. I pulled myself out of my thoughts and quickly finished getting ready.
