Marie passed away twenty years ago on the first floor of my house, and I wish I'd been there to see her die. No, I didn't hate my sickly mother-in-law, but the night of her death was the first in months that I'd managed to convince my wife, Belle, out on a date. Since her mother had moved in with us, and since we had subsequently devoted ourselves to her care, Belle had grown withdrawn, forlorn. She worked herself to the bone, and I wanted to make sure that she wasn't sacrificing her own health as she attended to her mother's. 

The date itself, a dinner at Belle's favorite restaurant, was perfect. We were gone for only two hours in total, and still the brief respite seemed to do Belle good. She seemed like her old self—full of life once more. Looking back on it all now, I realize that night was the last time I saw her truly happy. 

The house was unnaturally quiet when we returned. Belle's whole body tensed the moment she stepped inside. Somehow, I think she knew. When we checked on Marie and saw that she had passed, my immediate response was not sorrow but nervousness. Marie and Belle were extremely close, and I knew Belle would never forgive herself for not being at her mother's side when she succumbed to her myriad of health problems. Ultimately, her death was attributed to a medullary stroke. It should have been a weight off of our shoulders; a sigh of relief after holding our breath for so many months. Instead, a different kind of tension settled over our household: one made of equal parts grief and guilt.

Her funeral was an intimate one. Marie had emigrated from France when Belle was only a toddler, and despite having lived in the States for nearly two decades when I met her, she confessed to me that she still felt like an outsider. My mother-in-law spoke little of her life back in France, but I knew that her husband drowned in a sailing accident, and that her son, Belle's older brother, was estranged. She was an enigmatic woman, but she was also clever and kind, generous with both her time and her money. I got along with her better than I did my own mother, and I knew I would miss her greatly. 

Exactly one week after Marie's funeral, as I left the house in the morning for work, I discovered that our front door was already unlocked. I was fastidious about making sure our house was secured before I went to sleep, and I was certain that I'd locked the front door the night prior. Concerned that someone might have broken in, I looked around the first floor, then went upstairs to wake Belle. She assured me that she had not gotten up in the middle of the night, and she certainly hadn't gone outside. There was no evidence of forced entry, nor were any of our valuables stolen. All signs pointed to me simply forgetting to lock the door, and though I was incredulous, I let it go and promised to be more careful next time. 

The next day, I once again found the door unlocked. This time, I knew something was amiss; I had double-checked the locks on the previous night and knew that someone must've unlocked the door after I'd gone to sleep. I confronted Belle about this, but once again, she denied having opened the door. 

I decided to stay up late to figure out what was going on. Belle turned in at ten o'clock or so. I bid her goodnight, then set myself up in the office, playing video games to pass the time. I kept the volume low, intermittently going downstairs to check the door and peer out the front windows. We lived in a somewhat isolated community in California and all of the houses in my neighborhood were built around a lake. It made commuting to work a pain, but I considered myself very lucky to be so immersed in nature. When I looked out the window, the lake seemed to look back at me, its gently undulating surface glinting in the soft white light of the moon. 

Ten turned to eleven, to midnight, to one in the morning, and by two o'clock I was falling asleep in my chair before a sound startled me back to alertness. It was the familiar creak of our bedroom door swinging open. I looked down the dark hallway and watched as my wife slowly emerged from our room. 

"Belle?" I called out. She did not respond, verbally at least, though she did turn her body so that she was facing the office at the end of the hall. With a slow, shambling gait, she began to walk toward me. After a few steps, I could see that her eyes were open. I called out to her again, and still, she did not answer. For a strange moment, I felt as though she were taller than she should have been. 

Just before she stepped into the office, she turned to her right and made her way down the stairwell instead, which admittedly gave me a surge of relief. I stood from my chair and followed behind her, watching as she walked to the back door, unlocked it, and then did the same to the front door. Once she was done, she simply stood in front of the door, staring at the handle as if she expected it to swing open at any second. By that point, I had surmised that she was sleepwalking. I went to stand beside her, gently shaking her shoulder until she pulled her gaze from the doorknob to my face. 

"John?" She said my name groggily. "How did I get here?" 

I explained to her that she'd been sleepwalking, which was remarkably out of character for my wife. Belle slept like a rock, always had, and I'd never heard any stories about her sleepwalking in her youth. She was similarly confused and voiced aloud the question I was thinking: how many nights had she been doing this without either of us realizing? It was a strange situation, but I took some comfort in the fact that we'd solved the mystery of the open front door. 

In the morning, I suggested that Belle visit a sleep specialist to see what could be done about her sudden bout of parasomnia. I wasn't concerned per se—Belle didn't show any interest in venturing outdoors during these episodes, and even if she did, it wasn't as though we lived in a bustling city where she could easily wander onto a busy road. Still though, I knew we would both sleep better at night (no pun intended) knowing that she'd consulted a doctor. Also, though I didn't say this to Belle, I was a little unsettled by the idea of her unlocking our doors in the middle of the night. As ridiculous as it sounds, the way she'd been looking at the door really made it seem like she was expecting someone. Belle agreed that she should see a professional, and so the two of us began researching parasomnia treatments and sleep clinics in the area. 

It was around this time that I received an unexpected voicemail. One evening, while sorting through messages left on our home phone, I found a voicemail that had been left by a man claiming to be Belle's older brother, Marc. In it, he explained that he'd learned of Marie's death through our town's obituaries, and he expressed both his condolences and his desire to reconnect with his estranged sister. 

"*I don't know if you even remember me*," He said in his message, addressing Belle. "*Or if Marie ever talked about me, but I regret not reaching out sooner. It's a little late now, I know, but if you're open to it, give me a call back. It'd be nice to finally meet you.*" 

It sounded legitimate, despite the fact that I didn't know how Marc would've gotten our home phone number. I showed the message to Belle and she resolved to give him a call back, though she didn't seem particularly excited to do so. She had a lot on her mind, and I suspect that part of her resented her elder brother for disappearing from her life all those years ago. 

Days passed as Belle and I attempted, largely unsuccessfully, to settle into our old routines. Though Marie was gone, her spirit seemed to loom larger than ever before. I saw her everywhere: in her tea set in the kitchen, in her rosary on the fireplace mantle, in my wife's dejected gaze. I found myself having more and more trouble sleeping, determined to stay awake to supervise Belle in case she suddenly decided to venture beyond the threshold of our home. 

The building tension in our quiet home reached a breaking point one night, three weeks after Marie's funeral. I awoke in the middle of the night, as I'd grown accustomed to doing. It was raining outside, and the noise it made against my roof gave the impression of something scuttling around in my walls. Before I even opened my eyes, I felt the cold sheets beside me and knew that Belle was gone. I got out of bed with a sigh, making my way downstairs to the front door. Belle wasn't standing in the entryway as I'd expected, and my heart dropped a bit when I saw that this time, the front door was cracked open. Thinking Belle's sleepwalking had finally prompted her to leave the house, I threw open the door and stepped outside, looking out into the foggy night. 

From the edge of the lake, barely visible through the mist, something emerged from the water. A dog perhaps, or some other four-legged creature. It didn't trot as much as it did glide, surging up the shore with incredible speed. After thirty or so meters, the animal's posture shifted. It seemed to unfurl, transitioning from running on four legs to two. 

I watched for a few more seconds, dumbfounded. What I thought was an animal looked more and more human with every step it took towards my house. The thing's skin was as pale as the moon. Long white hair sprouted from its head, hanging in wet, stringy clumps that clung to its torso. Even from where I stood, I could tell it was huge—easily nine feet tall once fully upright. And yet it moved with a terrible, unnatural grace. It wafted like a powerful gust of wind through the night, sprinting straight towards me.

I slammed the front door shut and turned the lock with shaking hands. *It was a trick of the light*, I told myself. *It was only a person, distorted by the fog.* But even so, a person running full-tilt towards my house in the dead of night wasn't much better. And where in the world was Belle? Had she gone outside? Should I go out to look for her? 

I listened, holding my breath, as the person(?) drew near enough that I could hear the grass crunching under their feet. Then, there came the sound of thumping against wood as they ascended the steps of my porch. I expected them to try the handle, but instead, they veered off to the side, following the wrap around porch like they knew exactly where they were going. 

*Oh my God*, I remember thinking. *Did Belle open the back door?*

I tore through the house, nearly losing my footing on the hardwood as I rounded the corner into the kitchen. The back door was wide open, swaying slightly in the breeze. And there, standing just outside the threshold, was Belle. Her back was to me. She stood motionless on the porch, staring out into the darkness beyond the yard. Her hair hung limp and soaked, her nightshirt clinging to her frame like she'd been standing in the rain for hours. I grabbed her by the shoulders and pulled her inside. The moment I touched her, she jolted like someone waking from a deep sleep.

She blinked rapidly, looking around as if seeing the kitchen for the first time. "What—what’s happening?" she asked, her voice small and shaky. She said she’d been having a terrible nightmare, though she couldn’t quite remember the details. Only that it had felt real—*too* real. Her hands trembled as she touched her own face, like trying to confirm she was truly awake. She looked terrified.

"Did you see anyone?" I asked her, but it was a useless question. She'd been asleep and dreaming. If there had been an insane person running around outside of our house, she wouldn't have seen them. Together, we searched the house on the off-chance that someone had slipped in through the back door. When we had assured ourselves, to the best of our ability, that there was no one else in the house with us, Belle's posture shifted. The tension in her shoulders gave way to regret. Remorse, even.

She looked down at the floor, brought her hands up to her face, and shook her head. "I'm sorry," she whispered. Then, over and over again: "I'm so sorry."

I went to her and wrapped my arms around her. She felt so cold, likely from the wind she had been facing while she stood in wait. Shaken and sorrowful, we waited for morning together. We didn't yet know it, but from that point onwards, things would only get worse.
