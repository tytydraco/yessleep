It was only a dream, right?

I mean there was absolutely no way that he could actually be stood in my bedroom, I had seen his lifeless body go under the wheels of that car just a fortnight ago. His bones mangled and blood dripping from his wide open twisted jaw. His crumpled head had landed on the gravelly tarmac in such a way that his eyes gazed into mine. I couldn’t blame the distraught driver of that Range Rover, he never even saw him coming as he flew out into the road in front of him like a chaotic flash. 

The shrill of the car horn and his terrified cry seemed to harmonise and echo throughout the busy street. The crowd of horrified onlookers gathered around him, as the surround filled with blue flashing lights and deafening sirens. It was though, unfortunately too late. He lost his life that day, on that road. I of course was so very upset. I didn’t know how he could be so careless as to trip off that curb, and into the oncoming path of that two tonne lump of gleaming plastic and polished metal. I had tried so desperately to grab hold of his clothing to stop his stumble, well, that’s what I told the police anyway.

So, just how, was this man stood at the foot of my bed. He was just staring, his hand held in front of him pointing at me, just as I was drifting slowly into my nightly slumber. His cold gaze and damning judgement was plastered all over his decrepit face. After all it wasn’t my fault that he had tormented me every day for those five years at school. We had met all these years later to clear the air, we were about to go and grab a drink at the local bar. He almost had me fooled, the way he apologised and said how he had now matured and was settling down with his long time girlfriend. I didn’t even want his pathetic excuse for an apology, the audacity of him, to play victim. 

I thought this would be the last of it, that his cruelty would now stop with his last breath. Yet  there he was his frail bloodless frame remained motionless as I lay, stuck in a paralysed state in one’s pit. He then began to slowly make his way to my bedside, he placed his boney hand by my churning stomach and leaned his brittle body over mine as his lifeless face neared my ear. 

“I know what you did”

Came the whispered words from his desolate lips, just before he quickly disintegrated into a smoke filled dusty cloud above me. My limbs were then relieved from their invisible binds, my dried throat croaked as I shot up eyes darting frantically around my room. They were met by nothing but bleak darkness. The terrifying encounter marked my mind like a fresh seeping wound. 

But, surely, 

It was only a dream, right?
