Saturday mornings always had a particular flavor, a mix of calm and routine. As usual, I woke up a little later, savoring the luxury of sleeping in. Outside, the weather was freezing, a fine drizzle falling against the windows, making the city even quieter than usual.

I got ready quickly, throwing on a thick coat and my favorite scarf before heading out. I needed to stop by the office to pick up some documents. A chore, but necessary. The streets were deserted, which was strange, even for a Saturday morning. Not a sound, not a single car. I reassured myself, thinking that the freezing weather must have kept everyone indoors. But as I walked, I couldn’t shake off an uneasy feeling, you know, like the one you get when you feel someone’s eyes on you but can’t figure out where it’s coming from.

I quickened my pace, refusing to look back. It was ridiculous, of course. I was alone. When I arrived at the office, everything went as usual. A few colleagues were there, chatting around the coffee machine. Nothing out of the ordinary. The day passed quickly, filled with the usual tasks.

On my way out, I stopped at the bakery to grab some bread. Once inside, as I reached for my wallet to prepare the change, I clumsily dropped my bag. Bending down to pick it up, I felt someone brush past me quickly. A silhouette I hadn’t noticed before, leaving the bakery. The scent of their perfume was eerily familiar, identical to mine. They were also wearing clothes similar to mine: a gray top, a long black coat, and boots just like mine. But I didn’t pay much attention to it, too busy gathering my things. After buying the bread, I headed home.

But that feeling of being watched came back, stronger this time. As I walked down the street leading to my house, my eyes were drawn to a window in the building across the street. Someone was there, standing behind the glass. A still figure that seemed to be staring at me, eerily dressed in a way that was very similar to how I was dressed. I stopped, uneasy, and as soon as our eyes met, the figure stepped back, disappearing into the shadows of the room. A cold shiver ran down my spine.

In the days that followed, things got worse. I started seeing that figure more and more often. Always from a distance, always at the same distance, always motionless. But every time I tried to approach, it disappeared. Then I began to notice troubling details. That person… they looked like me. Not just a little. It was me. But their gaze… that was what chilled me the most. Empty eyes and a smile… that smile was too wide, too rigid, as if it had been carved into their face.

One evening, as I was heading home, I saw them standing at the far end of the street. They didn’t move, didn’t make a sound. They just stared at me. I ran to my house, slammed the door behind me, and locked all the bolts. Out of breath, I spent the evening watching through the window. They weren’t there anymore. But I knew they would come back.

Then came that night. I was lying on the couch, casually watching an episode of Game of Thrones with a tub of Cookie Dough ice cream in hand (the best, no debate), when the power went out. The house was plunged into total darkness. I stayed still for a moment, listening to the silence, until I gathered the courage to head down to the garage and reset the circuit breaker. Once there, the garage door was slightly ajar. I knew I had closed it.

Across the street, under the flickering light of a streetlamp, I saw them. Motionless. But this time, something was different. They were… taller. Terribly tall. Their arms and legs seemed unnaturally elongated, their thin and emaciated body casting a grotesque shadow on the ground. I froze, unable to look away.

When I finally reset the breaker, the lights came back on, illuminating the street. They were closer now. Only a few meters away. I could see every detail: their face was identical to mine, but their eye sockets were empty, oozing a dark red liquid that looked like blood. Their smile had stretched far beyond the limits of what was humanly possible, revealing too many teeth, sharp and unnatural.

They didn’t move, but their gaze seemed to pierce through me. I dropped the flashlight and ran, without looking back, all the way to my apartment. There, I hid under my bed, trembling, my heart pounding wildly.

I don’t know how long I stayed there, but I heard them. Slow, dragging footsteps echoing through my house. Then a breath, long and cold, just on the other side of the door.
