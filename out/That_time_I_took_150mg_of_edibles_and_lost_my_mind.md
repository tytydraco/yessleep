I was 18 and football and wrestling were over so I decided to try weed for the first time. I had no prior experience with any weed before. I bought these "delta 8" gummy peach rings. The package said do not take more than 4 within 8 hours. I thought I was being responsible in taking 3. They were 50 mg a piece. For my first weed experience I took 150mg of THC. 

My experience changed my life. I am in a constant state of questioning my own existence and the absurdity of all things in existence. 

I took them around 8PM, and went to take a shower to relax hoping to coast into a peaceful high. After about 30 minutes of sitting in the shower nothing had come on so I decided to go to bed with my girlfriend. I laid there for a while and remembered that the new Boba Fett show had just dropped a new episode. I decided I'd watch that. My girlfriend had fallen asleep within the first few minutes of the episode, so I was watching it alone in bed. 

About halfway through i started to feel a little hazy. But nothing I didn't expect, I was exited that it had started. So I just laid back and let it wash over me. 

I don't remember how much time had passed but eventually I convinced myself that I died. I was horrified but this realization wasn't anywhere near as mind altering as what was to come.

I began seeing these fluttering hazy colors surround either side of my field of view. The colors sort of looked like the 2 Use Your Illusion album covers from Guns and Roses. 

I eventually came to the conclusion that these colors represented my understanding of "Heaven and Hell" and as I thought more on my morality and the life I had lived, either side would seem to overcome the other. I remember hearing distorted voices from each side. 

This went back and forth for a while, and I began to hyperventilate. I began questioning my understanding on either side. They were only represented by the color that they were and the distorted voices coming from each of them. I lost sight of which side was "heaven" and which side was "hell". I knew that I needed to choose either one to envelop me but I didn't know which side was which. It was clear though that there was a distinction between the two.

I don't remember which side I ended up on. But  what I do remember is that shortly after I was absorbed into the side I chose, everything was ripped away from me. 

This is where it began. 

My entire understanding of my own existence was taken from me. I heard distorted chanting surrounding me, it felt like every single atom around me was chanting. The chanting was distorted and droning, it wasn't English but somehow I knew exactly what they were communicating to me. 

It was that absolutely nothing exists. 

They were deconstructing my understanding on everything. I do mean everything. For example, I remember early on as my understanding of time left me the chanting said that "we create concepts like time" as if to distract ourselves from the absurdity of existence.

When I say I lost my understanding it's important to know that I don't mean that I was incapable of grasping the concepts of things like time and physical space. It was more so that they were taking those concepts and pointing out the fact that they are completely illusionary and nonexistent, and were crafted to create this false reality that I understand and live in. 

I became aware of the fact that absolutely nothing existed, and I began to feel that fact in a physical way. It's hard to put any of this into words but it's most difficult to describe they way I felt physically. 

I felt like I was infinitely compact. I felt my own nonexistence. I felt like I was a singular atom being pressed inward by surrounding atoms. I also somehow felt this friction stretching me in every possible direction.

I just remember feeling like I was an atom inside a dense piece of matter like a rock.

I looked to any comforting experience from my life to escape. But it just lead to more deconstruction of my mind. 

Eventually I came to the conclusion that I have always been in this place, and that I was just blissfully unaware of it. Therefore my entire life, friends, family, experiences, and memories were all imaginary distractions from this reality. 

This went on for what felt like actual eternity, and eventually after throwing up I suddenly felt my own heartbeat, and something about that brought me back to my reality.

I just remember thinking "my hearts beating, so I can't be dead." And I fell asleep. I didn't wake up until 2PM the next day in a pool of my own vomit. My girlfriend had taken some edibles too and woke up after me not recalling any vivid experiences. 

We went and got Pizza Hut, and went about our lives. I had a really hard time coping with the experience for a while. I had panic attacks several times over the next few months. 

6 months after the experience I graduated high school and married my girlfriend.

I'm 20 now and it's been a little over 2 years since the experience, and I'd like to say I've recovered. My wife and I have 2 sons and I've got a nice EMT job coming up.

 Once in a great while I'll get an uneasy feeling,  but I look at my sons and it all feels a little better.

I do have my own ideas on what I experienced, but if I dwell on them too much I get nervous so I try and avoid it. 

I feel like I'm finally in a place where I can at least attempt to explain my thoughts on it so please DM me if you'd like to talk about it at all. My name is David by the way.
