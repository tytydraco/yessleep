I’ve been a sailor for twenty one years. On cargo ships. 

I’ve hauled cargo, fought pirates, survived storms and even fished dead men out of the water. The ocean doesn’t scare me. But silence does. Especially the kind that knows you’re listening.

The container came aboard in Colombo. Black, matte finish. Marked fragile. No refrigeration, no special handling. Loaded by a crane like any other cargo. The manifest said “Extraterrestrial Geological Sample – Meteorite, provenance: Sri Lanka, Anuradhapura dig site.” Just another slab of rock for some lab in Europe.

But it wasn’t like the others.

Even before we left port, I felt it. A sort of strange, eerie feeling. You ever walk past a place and your skin prickles as if something’s watching from a window? That sort. That container had no windows, but I swear it watched.

Also, I couldn’t help but notice something peculiar. None of the birds that sometimes circled the ship ever flew above that container. Or perched on it. They avoided it like a brick of poison.

MV Monarch finally set sail for Europe, heading west into the Arabian Sea. Day shifts were fine. It was the nights that bothered me. Alone on deck, making rounds with nothing but a flashlight and a half dead walkie talkie.

By the third night, I dreaded walking up to the container. I’ll tell you why. You see, there were no sounds near it. That’s what got to me. The wind hushed when I passed that area. The usual clang of metal and sea was swallowed by something deeper, like a held breath. Even my boots would stop making any sound. Just a deathly void.

I didn’t tell anyone. You don’t last long on the sea by sounding unhinged.

Then it happened. 

The next night I tripped and dropped my torch a little away from the container. Was I pushed from behind? Could be. I don’t know. I bent down to pick the torch up. That’s when I felt it.

Something like a tremor… not underfoot, but in the air around it. A stifling sense of pressure. As though the space around that box had thickened to a glue like thing. 

When I stood back up, I noticed that the door of the container - stoutly bolted and padlocked until now - had ripped open. 

I didn’t run. Should have. But I froze. 

I felt a gentle nudge. And my boots - new, regulation issue - suddenly felt loose. I looked down. My feet weren’t inside them.

No fall. No stumble. Just… separation. Like a layer of myself had floated up and forward.

That’s the last clear thing I remember.

There were dreams after that. I think they were dreams. A vast stretch of red sand. A burnt out sky. Things standing still but flickering, like shadows with no bodies. One of them pointed at me. Then through me. But it was all so painless.

There was a low hum. A tone just below hearing. It seemed to come from everywhere - container walls, the ocean, even from my sinews and bones. Like a primeval groan. 

And then… release. A brilliant flash to end it all.

They say I’m missing. Let them. 

They say they found my boots next to the container, which was found twisted open, with the meteorite gone.

I was the only one who saw it all. And I’ve gone nowhere. I’m just a little lighter. A little more hollow. Like space created a cosmic void within me.

I still float beside the ship at night, just above the waterline. Watching. Listening. Waiting.

It’s a mystery of course. Maybe they’ll know someday. Maybe they won’t. 

The rock must have been precious.

They should have seen what came for it to take it back.
