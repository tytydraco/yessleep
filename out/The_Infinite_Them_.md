The human mind really can adapt to anything, I mused, resting my bolt-action hunting rifle against the coat rack. My back pain was flaring up, so I needed both hands free to gently lower my crumbling spine onto the folding chair that I had positioned to face our front door. Once settled, I pulled the weapon onto my lap and continued to let my thoughts wander. 

I couldn't believe this would be the fifty-seventh intruder. Not only that, but I marveled at how desensitized I had become to the whole process. Then, I glanced down at my watch.

5:30PM.

As I whispered the word *"showtime"* to myself, a yawn accidentally leaked from my open mouth as well. This evening ritual has become alarmingly routine. So redundant that it was almost boring. Tedious, even. I yielded to some rising impatience, allowing my right index finger to dance softly up and down the trigger instead of sitting still. Wearily, I put my feet up on a nearby half-packed moving box. Might as well relax while I wait.

Leaning back, I found myself surveying the surrounding mess. After weeks of packing, our home had become a labyrinth of sturdy brown boxes - a clear indicator that we had accumulated too many things and stored it within too little space. All things considered, though, the move was coming along.

Snapping out of the distraction, my gaze refocused on the tiny bullseye I had drawn on the door in red marker a few weeks prior. While she was home, I hid the mark from Holly behind a magnetic to-do list. Probably an unnecessary precaution - it’s an innocuous splotch of crimson about the size of my rifle’s barrel. Just a smudge from my wife’s perspective. That said, I don’t want her trying to clean it off. I would have to stop her. Then she would ask why it’s important to keep a ruddy mark on the door amidst the move and selling the house. That is a question she doesn’t want the answer to, I reflected, tilting my rifle up so its snout overlapped the red dot, making the smudge disappear from view.

That target has saved me a lot of back pain, and I don’t really want to go without it. In the past, I’ve missed that first shot. Inevitably, that results in a fight or a chase - exhausting no matter how you slice it. Now, when they twist the lock and open the door, the bullseye guides me to that perfect space right between their eyes. 

Sparks of pain started to crackle where the butt of the rifle met my chest. I sighed loudly for no one’s benefit and swung the firearm a little to the left so I could check my watch again, feeling impatience evolve into concern. 

5:41PM.

A little late, but not unheard of. I shifted my shoulders to release the mounting tension from holding the firearm up and ready to fire. Externally, I remained calm, but deviation from the routine had spilled some adrenaline into my veins. I felt my eyes dilate and my focus sharpen - my body bracing itself for new circumstances, a change in the routine. Upon hearing a loud mechanical click and a subsequent scream from the other side of the house, my predatory instincts withered to baseline.

They had been doing this more and more recently, I lamented, trudging down the hallway. The majority still entered through the front door, at least according to the latest counts.

A bear trap covered the back entrance when they came through that way, though. 

Turning left at the end of the hall, I lumbered down the two rickety wooden steps that connect my home to my garage floor. As I flip on the lights, I see him - for the fifty-seventh goddamned time. The steel maw was biting down hard on his left leg, and it clearly had interrupted some forward motion, judging by the newly broken nose. The poor bastard went face-first into the concrete on his way down.

As usual, he’s confused and pleading for his life. He’s telling me what he can give me if I show him mercy. And if I can’t show him mercy, he asks me to spare Holly. The begging stops when he sees me standing over him. Sees who I am, I mean. Like always, the revelation short-circuits him, his behavior shifting from frenetic negotiation to raw existential panic mixed with blind rage. The type of frenzied anger that your brainstem fires off because none of the higher functioning parts of your nervous system have enough of a hold on what is transpiring to enlist a less primordial emotion. 

Same old dog and pony show. Wordlessly, I empty a round into his forehead. After savoring the renewed silence for a moment, I sent my boot crashing down into the foot that’s still caught in the bear trap. It snaps and separates at the ankle, releasing small fireworks of black dust launching festively into the air.

No blood, thankfully. Cleanup would be a nightmare if they had blood. The bodies aside, cleanup is minimal. Only bone shards and obsidian sand, both of which are easily vacuumed. 

Having them come through the garage is undoubtably convenient from a storage perspective. Less distance to move the bodies. I drag the corpse to a metal storage closet that used to hold things like my snowblower. My key clicks into the heavy-duty lock, and I pull the door open, revealing the bodies of intruders fifty-five and fifty-six.

Or what remains of them, at least.  

After only a day of being dead, fifty-six is already a skeleton. He sits lonesomely against the back of the storage closet, making him look like an underutilized “Anatomy 101”-style learning mannequin. Fifty-five, in contrast, has been completely reduced to a pile of thin rubble coating the bottom of the cabinet.

Whatever they are, and whatever they’re made of, their decomposition is extraordinarily rapid. Another microscopic silver lining, I suppose. No organic tissue? No stench of rot or swarm of death flies. The clothes and jewelry disintegrate into the unknown material, too. My wife’s cheap vacuum is getting a lot of mileage consolidating the black detritus for further disposal.

I cram fifty-seven into the closet, trying my best to lift from my core and not aggravate the herniated discs in my lower back any more than required.

All of the corpses are very manageable, except the one. But I do my best to ignore that exception. The implications make me doubt myself.

Holly never gets home before 7PM on weekdays - plenty of time to clean up the mess. We live alone at the end of an earthy country road in the Midwest. Our nearest neighbors are half a mile away. Even if they hear it, a single rifle shot is hardly cause for alarm around here. Weekends are trickier. In the beginning, I’d send her on errands or walks between 5PM and 7PM, but that was raising suspicion. Now, I catch the automatons down the road with a bowie knife through the neck on the weekends. The rifle is better for my joints, though, so that’s what I use during the week. 

With intruder fifty-seven disposed of, I return to the front of the house to pour myself a sedative. I fill a clean mug from the dishwasher half-way full with black, syrupy brandy and I sit down at the kitchen table, unable to make it anywhere else due to the simmering pain in my back.

As the cheap liquor begins to swim through my head, I can’t silence the impulse to ruminate.

Perhaps “automatons” isn’t entirely accurate. They can react to information with forethought and intelligence. They just always arrive at the same time, the same place, and for the same reason, every single day. That part, at the very least, is biologically automated. 

They’re predictable. Its why the “red dot” hack works - it wouldn’t work if they weren’t all an identical height. Same reason they’re predictably concerned about Holly’s safety, too. 

The intruders think they’re me returning from work. 

Fifty-seven days ago, I was walking home from work at a nearby water treatment plant. I think I was about half a mile from home when I stepped on what felt like a shard of glass beneath my feet. I didn’t see what I had crushed, if there was anything physically there at all. Instead, my head was tilted up, watching light filter through tree branches when it happened.

Instantaneously, I felt like I had just come off a wooden rollercoaster - all nausea, disorientation, and vertigo. Next was the splitting. I was in my body, but I could feel myself growing out of it, too. The stretching sensation was agony - pure and simple. Imagine the tearing pain of ripping off a hangnail. Imagine it again, but now it’s covering your entire body and doesn’t seem like it’s ever going to stop, no matter how hard you pull and wrench at the rogue skin. 

When the pain finally subsided, I had only a moment to catch my breath before the copy was on top of me. Paradoxically shouting at me to explain myself with its hands tight around my neck. I didn’t have an explanation, but I gladly reciprocated the violence. Knocking my forehead into his, I dazed him, allowing me to spin my hips and reverse our positions. 

All I knew was he needed to die, so I buried my thumbs into his eyes and pushed until he stopped moving. Through briny tears, I pulled his body by the legs off the dirt road and into the woods, hands wet and shaking from the shock and the savagery. 

When I returned home, I didn’t attempt to explain anything to Holly - I mean, what is there to tell that won’t land me in an asylum or jail? I thought I had some kind of episode or fugue state that resulted in me killing another man in cold blood, because I had mistaken him for some sort of doppelgänger. 

Naturally, I took the next day off from work.

I awoke from a nap that afternoon to an unknown man whistling from somewhere in my home. Drenched with fear, I crept from room to room, following the cheery noise. When I snuck into the kitchen, there I was - tie loosened and hands sudsy, just getting to work on some dirty dishes from the previous night. Thankfully, Holly wasn’t home yet when I absentmindedly drove a kitchen knife through his back.

Quit my job the following day and blamed my worsening back pain. The best kind of lies, the most effective ones anyway, are designed from truths. 

I’ve never proved this, but my guess is the copies materialize from where that split happened at the same time it happened every day. When they appear, they don’t seem to know that they’re a copy. Because of that, they just pick up where I left off - walking home after a day of work.

Excluding the aforementioned exception. 

When I noticed that my wedding ring had a plastic texture, immobile and fused to my skin, I didn’t want to believe it. But it kept gnawing at me. I couldn’t keep ignoring the possibility. One day, I ventured into the woods around where the split happened. When I found that the original’s corpse seething with maggots, fungus, and sulfur, I realized what I was. 

I love Holly just like he did, and I’m all she’s got now. She doesn’t need to go through this pain if I can prevent it. We’re moving to Vermont for retirement, where she’ll be protected from this predicament and from the infinite them. 

I’m not sure what will happen when the copies arrive at an empty house, but they aren’t my problem. All that matters to me is maintaining the illusion - Holly can never know the truth.

We set our moving date for the end of the week. A few more days left, a few more intruders to deal with.

I chug the rest of the brandy, tipping the mug upside down and tapping the bottom to insure I’ve imbibed every single molecule of it. Dropping the cup on the kitchen table, I drunkenly bury my face in my hands and wait for Holly to get home from work, not even bothering to turn on the lights even though the sun has finally set.

Before I can even close my eyes, however, I hear something that causes panic to sizzle in my chest like violent electricity.

It's the sound of an approaching conversation from outside. Holly, talking to what sounds like me - to a copy of me. Although, I suppose we’re both copies.

There’s never been two before, I thought, but their patterns have been shifting. More of them entering from the back door, but still some entering through the front. Now, it would appear that there are two copies born every day - one that comes through the back, and one that comes through the front at a later time.

Retrospectively, the combination of the two feels like a natural next step - a foreshadowed evolution I could have predicted if I was smart enough. I should have been more prepared, but I got complacent.

With the doorknob turning, I clumsily slipped my wobbling frame behind a stack of brown boxes in the kitchen, rifle in hand.

I’ll get the jump on him, take the copy out before Holly can even understand what's happening.

The male voice enters the kitchen first, but he hasn’t flipped on the light switch yet. Something about the voice is slightly off, though. It could be Holly’s brother, rather than a copy. She didn’t tell me he was coming over tonight, but he lives fairly close by. I try to confirm his identity by focusing on his voice as it nears, but I can’t seem to concentrate through the booze and the fear. It feels impossible to determine the truth of anything with the brandy sloshing around in my skull. And I just don’t have much time to decide on a course of action.

As the kitchen light clicks on, I emerge from my hiding place, the room a blinding swirl of color and noise.

Without hesitation or additional contemplation, I make my decision. I become automatic.

The rifle fires in the direction of the male voice, and the body [falls.](https://linktr.ee/unalloyedsainttrina)
