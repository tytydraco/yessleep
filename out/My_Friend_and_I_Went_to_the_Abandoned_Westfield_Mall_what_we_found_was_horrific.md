I’m shaking as I type this. I don’t know if this is a warning or a confession, but either way… I have to tell someone.

Back on March 19, 2007, me and my buddy Chris broke into Westfield Mall — you know, the one abandoned for almost 30 years now. It was this massive shopping complex that shut down after some freak accident no one talks about. It just rotted there, half-sunken into the earth like some ancient ruin.

We weren’t exactly brave. Just stupid teenagers looking for some fun.

Chris had heard that there was old cash registers still inside, and maybe even some lost merchandise. You know, vintage stuff. We figured we’d sneak in with flashlights, grab some cool shit, and get out.

The front doors were chained and there were police tape and a sign that read “DO NOT ENTER THE PREMISES”, but someone had already broken a window on the side. The second we slipped in, the air changed. Thick. Wet. It stank like mold and rust and weirdly rotten flesh or something older underneath.

We clicked on our flashlights and started exploring. Storefronts were frozen in time — mannequins still dressed in old ‘80s fashion, posters for long-dead bands. It was creepy, but not dangerous. At least, that’s what we thought.

About an hour in, we found the old food court. Half the ceiling had collapsed, and a tree was actually growing through the concrete. Chris was poking around when he found this weird staircase going down into the maintenance tunnels.

I didn’t want to go. Every part of my body screamed no. But Chris called me a little bitch and started walking down the tunnel. I couldn’t leave him alone, so I followed.

The tunnels were worse. Cramped, flooded in parts. And animals that were severed and organs removed or bit off. The flashlight beams seemed swallowed by the dark. That’s when we saw him.

At first, I thought it was a mannequin someone dragged down there. A man, pale as chalk, his skin almost glowing against the black. Curly hair matted to his forehead. But from the waist down… there was nothing. It looked like someone had hacked his body clean off. Just ragged flesh and bone.

His arms, though… they were the worst part. They were long, grotesquely thin, bending wrong like a spider’s legs. The fingers were sharp, tapering into cruel points like a praying mantis’s claws.

Chris gagged and stumbled back, making some noise — and that’s when the lights on our flashlights flickered.

And he moved.

He didn’t drag himself or walk himself like a normal person. It was more like… he crawled across the floor, silent and fast, arms clicking and stabbing into the concrete to propel him forward. Only when the light flickered did he move — and when the beams came back fully, he froze, twisted in some new horrifying pose.

I didn’t know what to do. Chris ran. I turned to follow, but the lights flickered again — and I heard a wet, crunching sound behind me.

I didn’t look. I couldn’t.

I ran blind, crashing into walls, sloshing through water, screaming. Somehow, I found the staircase again and scrambled up into the mall. The windows at the far end were letting in the faint blue glow of dawn. I didn’t stop running until I was outside.

Chris never made it out.

They found his body two days later, or what was left of it. It was like he had been hollowed out. No one believed my story. They said it was rats or drugs or trauma messing with my head.

But I know what I saw.

The thing in the mall… it’s not human. It’s not even alive. It’s something older. Something born from darkness, made of darkness. And it only moves when the lights die.

Westfield Mall is still there. Still abandoned.

But every so often, I hear about missing kids or homeless people who wander too close. And when the night falls heavy and the dark feels just a little too thick…

I swear I can hear the sharp click of those spider arms, waiting.

And After four years from that incident I went out again to the abandoned mall however the man was gone. I nearly threw up on what I saw.. Chris’s body was heavily mutilated and there were writing on the walls that said something about the “flesh-child” and I continued.

After Two Hours of nothing but finding 42 dead bodies and animals that were bitten I was about to leave when all of a sudden I hear some crying, quiet at first but it got louder and louder

I then went to check it out and what I saw horrified me.

There was a blood and flesh-like roots and a big sludge on the walls and there was a torso of some sort of child and it was crying again and again until it saw me where it then screeched and I swore I could’ve heard people who were damned to come here started screaming and begging for freedom and mercy.

I ran out of there and the police came in but they came back and found nothing
