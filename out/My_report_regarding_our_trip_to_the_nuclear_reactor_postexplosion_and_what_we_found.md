Oh boy, I don't even know where to start with this. The higher-ups told me I needed to write up a report. I just got back, my PTO is soon, and my shift ended 3 hours ago.   
  
My name is Adam and this is my report about my team exploring \[Redacted\]. Ramirez and Amelia were assigned to my squad  
  
As you know \[Redacted\] experienced their nuclear reactor blow up about 10-12 years ago. Never made news because the company that made it was already facing lawsuits for their faulty products. Had news gotten out, the company would've gone under due to all the damages and debt they would be stacked with. Can't have the big cats up there get arrested for making a town vanish and lives end. Anyway, my team was sent over to \[Redacted\] on \[Na/Na/Na\]. Our job was simple, take photos of the town and various rooms of the nuclear reactor facility. We were given some more advanced hazmat suits, a Geiger counter, a flashlight, a service weapon, and cameras. Photos were required, but videos even if they were short clips were also appreciated. 

We touched down via helicopter and would be picked up in 6 hours. I was glad I had taken a piss earlier because there was no way I would be opening my zipper in an area with enough radiation to make my junk turn into a glow stick. I must say, there was something sort of comforting about having a simple pistol on me. Not like we would have needed it, or I didn't think we would. We made our way into the town and started snapping shots of a few buildings. Get a nice wide shot of blown-apart buildings here and close-up shots of things like leftover bodies there. 

I will admit, I felt the need to sneeze a few times or rub a part of my body, but I didn't. I wasn't risking exposing my body to anything. The suit was sort of annoying as our masks were fitted with some thick air filters. We had access to two air tanks on our back should the filters go out. The Geiger counter going off in my ear every few minutes was pissing me off. To make things worse, I had to wipe ash off the eyes of the mask every so often. Should've negotiated sending a lead-covered drone in or something. We were dumped off there at midnight. Being there from midnight to six in the morning was totally not the worst time frame ever.

The town pictures were going fine, burnt and rusted cars, scorched clothing, and much more of the normal things you would expect. I sent Amelia to cover the insides of ruined homes. I then sent Ramirez to snap up cars and stores. I myself went ahead to the outside of the nuclear reactor itself. I have no idea what some of these fences were made of, but chunks were still standing with radioactive warning signs lying around. We were never given the full details of the explosion, but somehow the gold old American construction held up leaving most of the facility intact. The actual reactor was a blown-apart concrete mess.

I kept my distance from the metal sheets and anything else of that nature. I always imagined nuclear reactors being near a town for some reason. Nobody said it was actually next to a large ass facility taking 20 damn minutes to cross on foot. Why was I on foot you ask? Because the vehicle they gave us barely had gas in it and would probably burn out after a few miles. I took a lot of shots capturing the looks of the ruins. Ramirez and Amelia would soon follow after me with enough time. We walked into the facility itself and started recording. I was really getting annoyed aiming my camera and snapping every inch I walked so I decided a chopped-up video tour of the place would do just fine. Hit record, move the camera, and let it do the work.

There were a lot of stairs, metal walkways, and an empty environment. We took about two hours to document the place, we only got so far at a time as I wanted to read posters and get my hands on books that weren't incinerated, I even battled against the idea of stealing a fully sealed work shirt. I convinced myself that a washer and dryer could get an entire decade's worth of radiation out of it. I decided against it in the end. Now let me tell you, it didn't hit me that we didn't see any corpses until we realized something was off too late. I think it was four hours in when we started hearing screeching and running around the place. I thought it might have been wild animals, you never know. I was merely coping.

To investigate we did the stupidest thing, we split up and covered more ground. I was too panicked to stay rational. After 15 minutes of searching and radio calls, we found out what was running around. Well, I meant that it found us. I was in the middle of using my flashlight to scan the area hallway when I heard a scream on my radio. Ramirez was in trouble and close by. I sprinted as fast as I could through those confusing halls. That's when I saw it, a man in an older hazmat suit glowing with radiation. His suit was clawed open all over the place. He had grey skin, purple and black veins, a greenish glow to him, and the dark sunken eyes of someone who barely sleeps. I think his eyes were white as well, like a blind person. I didn't like those rotting bloody teeth either. 

I, being the absolute idiot I am, tried talking to him. I only noticed the patch on his suit that signified him as part of an older squad that had come to explore the area while the radiation had been more severe years back. This explains why they never came back. All of them turned into mutated radioactive freaks. I was frozen in fear not able to take out my gun. Ramirez was fighting off two of them attacking him, most likely craving his skin and organs. The last thing I expected when we got here was irradiated zombies. I would snap out of it soon enough to put a bullet in the two of them.   
Ramirez would say something that would only make sense after I had already done it. I quote: "You absolute dumbass, guns make noise. That noise will echo through every hall drawing the rest of them toward us."

In my defense, I didn't exactly have a melee weapon or combat training. We had an hour and a half until evac, and many of those freaks were waking up. This included the previous residents of this area. Seems that they had been mutating and roaming around for years. I believe this whole nuclear facility was one big nest. Me and Ramirez made our way to a breakroom and had the plan of barring the door. Looks like Amelia had a similar idea as she was about to seal the door off when we got there. Ten minutes of holding the door closed as we dragged heavy appliances and furniture to block the door off later and we were safe. One hour and twenty minutes until evac, a hoard of at least 25 of these...things, and a four-story dive out the window as(maybe) our only possible escape. 

We spent quite some time discussing and even fighting against ideas. One of them was taking the couch, getting on it, and dropping out the window with it hoping the cushions would break our fall. Yeah, not how physics works. We debated the dumpster that was near the window, but I had a fear that one of our limbs could hit the edge of the metal dumpster causing a bad break. Plus, the trash is nearly a decade old and has settled tightly. It might have had the density of a brick for all we knew. Don't ask how, but we found a way to make a phone case that allows the phone not to fry at certain radiation levels. That includes our cameras. I tried sending off a report to HQ about our situation.   
I think we spent 30 minutes awaiting a response. Our genius scientists in the safety and comfort of their office chairs and cubicles a far distance away gave us the best(horrible) advice ever. "Stay put where you are, and make a break for it before the copter touches down."

So, we did just that. I did the calculations and realized it would take five minutes to break from the facility. About ten to run from the facility to our car. And then another five minutes of dodging and weaving debris to get to evac. That was a total of twenty minutes, give or take with the five-minute grace period the helicopter pilot would wait for us. Our time would come and we would remove the things we used to block the door. I took the cameras and put them in my bag as the other two would be slowed down lugging them, we would still need to stay armed in case those radioactive freaks came back.

The instant we opened the break door we snuck our way around moving as fast but silent as possible. A few minutes later we got to the door. I had to push the rusted metal doors open so that we get out. Those suckers were jammed up, different doors than the ones we came in through. One good kick and that sent a loud echo everywhere, we had those freaks sprinting at us from everywhere. Before we could even step all the way out, Ramirez got snatched and taken away. I tried turning back to help him but too many of them started chasing us. Amelia had already grabbed me anyway. We made our way to the car, or it was more like a doorless and roofless Jeep. Isn't that just convenient? I'm not sure if it was the radiation hitting the battery, or the horrible gas but I spent 30 seconds starting the engine over and over before we got the Jeep to start.

I would pull out as fast as I could. I ended up rear-ending five of those bastards. That radiation must've given them superhuman aspects, I shit you not, those freaks were catching up to us at a constant 45MPH. Amelia and I made our way to the evac area just in time. We were late as I circled many buildings throwing the mutated freaks off our trail. The pilot was a minute away from taking off before he saw us. I readjusted the bag holding our cameras on my side and hopped into the helicopter. Amelia stayed on the ground with her pistol out. We were running out of time as more of those freaks were on the way and getting closer.

We didn't see that the side of her suit had been torn off, just bare skin with a large gash in her rib and side from not only a claw mark. But also a loose metal pipe sticking out of the wall she ran into when we had made our leave from the facility mere minutes ago. That bare skin exposure, blood loss, and radiation hitting her made her choose to stay back and hold them off. I tossed her my pistol and would be the only remaining member of us three to make it out that day. I got one more picture before we left as we took off. Amelia wounded and using both guns to put down as many of those freaks as she could to give us a headstart on leaving.

I'm stopping my report here, you have enough data. I was able to keep our cameras, just dig out the SD cards and go through our recordings and photos. Fill in the blanks yourself.

I'm off to print out a photo of Amelia to post on the office wall to memorialize the hero she was. This is Adam signing off.

P.S., I just found a small cut I got back in that radiation zone. I'm getting it checked out later today.
