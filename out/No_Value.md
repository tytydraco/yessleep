My phone just buzzed in my pocket.

The fog guides me. It wants this shared.

I’m bleeding. The fog is consuming. I don’t have long.

This is what happened.

This morning, I woke up and had the desire to be adventurous. Unfortunately, I am broke 95% of the time due to poor money management skills so some of the more exciting things were off the table for me. But there is this app that can be downloaded onto most phones that shows trails in your area and all the info about them. So, I looked through the list for a bit to find something that seemed interesting but not so difficult that I would regret hiking it in tennis shoes and basketball shorts. 

I found what seemed like the perfect trail, one called Misty Hill Creek. It was supposed to be this 3-mile hike on mostly flat ground with an area that was famous for its foggy landscape even when there was no fog supposed to be in the area. There was a small creek that ran alongside you most of the time you were hiking, perfect for dipping your feet in if you get too cold or filling your hat with if you wanted to take an impromptu creek bath. It was also only 10 minutes down the road; it surprised me I had not heard of this place before but I don't really get out much. 

So I threw on my basketball shorts and a sleeveless t-shirt and hopped into my car, ready to enjoy the perfect weather, the weed pen full of wax I was taking along with me, and the flask full of whiskey that I had paid far too much for. 

It took me about 15 minutes to get there. Nothing really notable to report from the drive except I definitely saw the fog coming in as I got closer. I remember thinking how crazy it was that there could be so much fog so close to where I live but none of it bleed off into where my neighborhood is. 

But even with the fog, the sun was warming me and I was getting all the good vibes I wanted to from this day. I was ready to go out and find a nice rock to sit on for a while, smoke some weed, drink, and contemplate where my life is going. As I parked my car I noticed that I could still see through the fog pretty clearly, at least a solid 50 feet or so. I did come here to see nature, so that was nice. 

I got out of the car and gathered the couple things I wanted to bring with me. Walking up to the trailhead I looked in appreciation of what mother nature was presenting before me. Not 40 feet to my right there was a small creek that was babbling along due to the rocks that poked out every few feet, giving me a sound I had only recently heard through noise makers. The trees looked full but damp, like the morning dew had never removed itself from their presence but had hung around to observe the day. It was exactly what I was hoping for. I unscrewed the top of my flask, took a nice deep drink, and took my first steps into the foggy unknown as I put it back in my pocket.  

My journey awaited. 

It got bad early; I kept hearing noises. I know what you are thinking, that of course there are noises, I am hiking after all. These were not twigs snapping and leaves being trampled. First, I heard laughter, it started out soft and barely audible. But then the laughter got stronger, and more maniacal too. This wasn't your grandma laughing at a fun joke you told her. No, this sounded far more sinister.   

I ignored it at first, wondering to myself if I had somehow got a laced weed vape and was just on a weird trip. But it got louder, as it did I began to jog instead of walk. The path was wide enough and clear enough even in the fog where I was not too stressed about keeping track of the path. Branches and twigs began to swing at my face as I had less opportunity to dodge them diminished. The laughter continued to get louder though, and my pace increased with it. But the time the laughter reached its peak volume and pitch, laughing like some villain who had successfully taken over the world by a weapon created by the world's only superhero. 

I covered my face with my forearms as I did my best to stay on the path and follow the logical way without running into anything or losing my way. But it was so loud, I couldn't bear it. After a minute or two of running my shoes caught a root that was sticking out and I went full force tumbling into the bushes that I was about to attempt to dodge. As the thorns cut into my body and I struggled to get free, I cried out in anger and pain, trying to drown out the sound of the laughter that was attempting to bury itself into my brain. But that's when I realized, it had stopped. 

There was no more laughter, there was no more anything when it came to sound. Once I had released myself from the bramble I had lodged myself in I was able to confirm, silence. Not even the creek was talking and chattering to me like it was at the beginning of the path. It was just this uneasy quiet that, while not as unnerving at the laughter, did make me want to get the heck out of this area as quickly as possible. I looked around and tried to gain my bearings, looking around for the trail or even a footprint or two to show which direction I had come from. 

Nothing. 

The fog had become thicker in the last few minutes, the woods had become tighter and more encapsulating, almost suffocating. I already had the sense of direction of a dead racoon, so between the fog and me genuinely not knowing in what direction I was running for the better part of 3 minutes, there was no hope. 

"Ok, well you wanted an adventure. A hike would've been a poor one anyways, now it is a real adventure!" I told myself, trying to calm myself down and not give into the panic instincts that was seeming to try and wiggle its way into my thoughts. I could handle this and anything else that was about to come my way. 

I brushed myself off as I spun around in a slow circle, this time giving my care to observe what I was seeing. As I tried to catch my bearings, I realized that there was nothing familiar here. Just like after I had taken a look originally after the "chase" if that's what you could call it, I saw nothing helpful. In fact, the more I looked the more I saw things that made me uneasy. As I already had said, the spacing of the trees was very different here and far tighter. I couldn't take more than 3 steps now without me having to move myself around the producers of oxygen we all love and adore. There was no trail anymore, just discolored brown and green grass with patches of leaves scattered miscellaneously throughout. I couldn't see far ahead though so maybe there was a trail up ahead, but where? What direction? How far? Where did it go? What wa- stop it, you are spiraling, that is not going to do you any good. Get it together. 

I still had my things I had brought luckily, but they were not going to do me much good in this situation. What good is a weed pen and some whiskey going to do? Maybe if I was clever I could use the heating element in the pen to start a fire, but would one even light out here with all the moisture? I highly doubt I would find any dry firewood, but that's ok because even with this going on I figured my odds of spending the night here would be incredibly slim. I just needed to stop letting indecision rule me and pick a direction, any direction. That was harder to do than you might think my friends. 

When you are surrounded by fog so thick you can't see 20 feet ahead of you, and you need to pick a direction that might be the difference between life, death, or at minimum a ton of crappy things, its hard. You wonder maybe you do recognize those rocks a few feet in front of you, try to remember any survival knowledge that might point you in the direction of civilization. I saw some moss on a rock nearby, isn't moss a navigational thing? Does it point away from civilization or towards it? Fuck it, I can't remember. My phone worked but it had 0 service, and I had never been smart enough to download smart things like a compass or a survival manual on there. It did have a full battery pretty much though so that was nice, but not much good it did me in this moment. 

I finally started walking, I can't really tell you how I picked the direction, but I know eventually my feet started moving again. That was all I could really do right? Put one foot in front of the other and hope I either came to civilization, the trail, or the creek. The silence was still deafening as I walked through the thick fog, giving me the same feeling I had when I was scuba diving out in the Bahamas.  

This felt similar, the fog made me feel like a stranger to this terrain. Like I was a captain of a submarine that had been away for years, only to return to shore and find this open world far less inviting than it used to be. To realize I longed for the cold steel of my underwater chariot where I had grown to know every nook and cranny. But here I was, stuck in this wide-open air that seemed too much to handle but also not enough simultaneously. I walked along the leaf scattered grass for what seemed like an eternity, until I finally saw something. 

It started out like most things do when you are walking through thick fog. I kept walking towards the shadow yet I continued to see nothing but darkness. It did seem to go in and out of focus once or twice, but its fog, what do you expect? 

The other weird part? 

Think about this, I can see 20 feet ahead of me right now. I had been walking for a solid two minutes in the direction of the "object" but I seemed to get not a step closer at any point. I started watching the ground in front of me as I walked, trying to pay attention to it. I know it seems silly, but I wanted to make sure I was walking forward. Fog does weird things to your head when you've been it for a while. The ground seemed to be moving ahead like normal, my footprints were being left behind in the fog damped grass. I looked up again, and the shadow in the distance looked the same. 

Wait, did it? 

I stopped moving and squinted into the fog, hoping my mostly closed eyes could make out something clearer than what my fully opened eyes could? I don't know, I never understood squinting, but I still did it like everyone else. Either way, I noticed there was movement within the shadow.  And there was no doubt that it was finally getting closer to me.  

Shit, this is what I wanted yea? But I thought I was coming to find this shadow, whereas now it felt like the shadow was coming to find me. What do I do? Do I stand my ground? If I start running, I might as well go back to square one, but is meeting what is very adamantly coming towards me worse than square one? I turned my head to both sides as I think about attempting to escape and when I look back, I see it. I see what had been coming towards me, it now stood in front of me. 

The man was wearing a white suit, and when I say white, I mean white from the tip of his collar to his cufflinks to his laces on his white dress shoes. It played tricks on my eyes in the fog as he seemed to blend in and out of the white blanket of water I had come to know as my new home. His eyes though, his eyes were not white. His eyes were pure, bright, red. He stood around my height so that would make him around 6 feet and some change, if only a couple pennies. He had short brown hair, his nose and ears were where they were supposed to be, and his mouth was a near perfect straight line that reminded me of when a character in Bob's Burgers is mildly displeased. 

"Hello?" I said cautiously. Not really knowing what to do, I had never met a person with red eyes in the middle of the fog before so I wasn't exactly up to date on what the protocol was here. Honestly, I'm just hoping that I don't get my face eaten at this point. 

Suddenly, the facial expression of the red eyed man brightens as he begins to talk, relatively cheerfully as well. 

"Hey there! Nice to meet you! What's your name?" 

No way in hell was I giving this random guy with red eyes my real name, so I went with one of the names I have used when I need to create burner emails for radio contests and crap like that. 

"Richard. Nice to meet you as well, what's your name? How did you get here? Can you help me get back to the trail? What the heck is this place?" Questions flow out of my mouth before I can even begin to contemplate controlling myself and not completing a 9 out of 10 word vomit. Luckily the red eyed stranger interrupted me after the last question while I was loading up my next. 

"Look slow down there man, I know you have a lot of questions. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to answer any questions except for one. And awkwardly enough, it isn't one that you just asked." He replied with a slight grin on his face, the grin looking very sinister with his blazing suns he had instead of eyes. 

"What do you mean you are not allowed to?" Asking what seemed like the obvious next question. 

He gave me a dry chuckle. “Still not asking the right questions my man.” 

 I thought I had thrown out the vital questions. What would be more pressing than asking whether I can get back to the trail or what this place is? After a minute or two of contemplation I simply shrugged my shoulders at him and said, "I don't know, I feel like I asked some pretty important ones." 

"Oh I am not denying they are important, but are they the MOST important right now? Is that the most pressing thing on your mind? How about your survival Richard? Has it ever crossed your mind whether you will make it out of this?" Do you really think, that with your weak mind filled with alcoholism and drug addiction can survive a place like this?" His face getting more constricted, more angry, and his voice was getting louder slowly but surely, punctuating every verbal jab with extra enunciation. 

"Do you really think that the guy who left his parents to rot in a nursing home because he couldn't handle the stress of weekly doctor visits for dialysis can make it out of what genuinely might be a bad situation Riiiichard? How about the guy that made 60 thousand dollars on crypto on some random little side bet of an investment that cost you 20 bucks and then BLEW IT!" He screamed these last two words, starting to advance on me during this last sentence. I backed up as the red eyed stranger stormed up to me, loading up his next bit of verbal abuse as I turned and started running. I heard him pick up the pace behind me as well as I heard the next verbal tirade commence, but instead of it being another instance of reminding me of some of my worst regrets screamed at the top of his lungs, it was just a simple sentence said so softly I wasn't even sure I heard it at first. 

"You've been dead for years, you've just been too much of a coward to admit it." 

I took a couple more steps after the sentence was said and then stopped. It was a sentence that had been playing around in my head these last few weeks. I mean let's face it, I work a dead end job, I have no family that I haven't screwed over, I haven't made an upward movement in years when it comes to my life, hell maybe even more than a decade. I’ve felt dead these last couple years. Felt like I was just some person playing their part as the supporting cast for all the people around me. Not actually having my own things to do or accomplish but needing to be there so that other people would have the extra in the background when they needed it. So that they would have one more person clapping in the background when they had their latest accomplishment. I hadn't articulated it to anyone, but I also hadn't told anyone about the weekly dialysis appointments being one of the biggest reasons I got so adamant on putting my parents in the home they were currently in. 

I heard footsteps slowly approach from behind me; they were slow but rhythmic in a predictable way. I looked up to see the red eyed man standing above me, his face back to that emotionless line punctuated by the eyes that seemed to burn even brighter now. 

"Do you know why you are here?" He said softly. 

With regretful tears in my eyes that I was trying to hold back, I stared back at the ground and shook my head from side to side. 

Again that soft tone that was still so clear. "Richard, we brought you here to die." 

A sob wracked my lungs as I tried to keep my composure. The man continued. 

"You have lived a worthless life Richard, we both know this. Your friends tolerate you, your family can't even do that much. You have ruined every relationship you have ever attempted within a few months due to your own lack of ability to commit. You hold down jobs like professional wrestlers hold each other down, for roughly 3 seconds. You never went to school or have done literally anything to better yourself. So why do you deserve to live? What good do you bring into this earth that is worth the resources you take from everyone else? Don't answer that, I know the truth. Just like I know your real name. I know everything about you, I know things about you that you haven't even figured out yet. Like what you could've become if you had given one single bit of a shit about your own life. But nope, here you are. A stain on this planet come to be washed away by the fog.  

I had long given up on holding back the tears that were forming and the sobs I was trying to refrain from sounding. I knew I deserved to die. The worst part is I could not even disagree with anything he was saying, I had no defense. He was speaking things I had thought myself many times. My brain had never been kind to me, and lately I felt like it was also becoming harder to fool when it came to finding ways to give myself peace. Weed had stopped working long ago but I smoked it out of habit, the alcohol would eventually kill me but at least it numbed the voices occasionally. I had overcome a heroin addiction many years ago, and even that had been calling out to me again after 10+ years of sobriety.  

I just needed something to quiet the voices. 

The man continued as I contemplated how I hoped my death would be quick, and what was waiting for me in the great beyond. 

"Now I have a couple options here, I could just snatch your soul, leave you here as a withering husk. You wouldn't really realize anything was happening until I brought your soul to the place where I plan on making it entertain me. In which case, well, somethings are better kept surprises." He said with a wink, and then continued. 

"But the one I personally hope you take, is that we will play a little game. This game might end in your survival, but it might end up with a fate that combines the first two. If you lose this game, your mortal being will be tortured for as long as the people in control of you desire, and then your soul will be handed over to people that are less friendly than the priors. This fate has no ending, it only has your next beginning. Don't bother asking more questions, this is as much information as you will get on the options. Most of the time I don't give people this choice, but I am feeling fun today." He finished with a grin that might have won me over if it wasn't for me finally noticing that where his teeth should be there was just darkness. Just a black, empty pit that called to me. 

It spoke to me even. 

Told me life would be easier if I just surrendered. I could survive some torture if it meant finally ending all this right? Who knows what awaits me in the normal afterlife, but it can't be anything good. This way I might be promised a release, an ending, a finality to it all. It beckoned for my soul to release itself from this mortal being and come join the others that had made the wise decision of just giving in. 

Instead, in one fluid motion I jumped to my feet and started sprinting as fast as my legs could carry me in the opposite direction. I ran harder and faster than I ever have in my life, dodging tree with precision I didn't know I was capable off, hopping over bushes. I was literally running for my life and my body responded as such. But in those first few moments I heard the faintest of whispers coming from behind me, but again still clear as ever. 

"Your choice has been made, the game will begin shortly. Good luck."  

What the heck could he mean about a game? A game for my soul?  I just wanted to go on a hike! I didn't come here to fight with demons in the possibility of eternal damnation with a bit of seasoning on top. I don't even know why I ran if I am being honest, it seemed like the best idea at the time, and I went for it. That smile man, that smile got to me. I 've never felt something like that. The evil within that called out to me while also being soothing, something deep within me kicked into gear and sent me flying out of that situation. But now what? 

 I held my forearms out as a shield from the trees trying to give me yet another beating, but with that came poor visibility so I just stumbled along doing more harm than good at some point. Eventually I ran out of breath and no longer heard anything behind me. I brought myself to a walking pace instead of a full run, trying to catch my breath in the damp air that seemed to be attempting to suffocate me as much as it offered me life. 

As I continued to press forward, hoping against every gut feeling I was having that maybe I would find some signs of civilization, of wildlife, of life in literally any capacity. Life doesn't always mean help, but even harm would most likely be a better alternative to what was standing behind me. That's when I found it, not signs of life, but a memoriam to death itself. 

Remember how I was wondering if a campfire was even possible in this situation? Well apparently, it is because I found a raging fire a few feet to my right. Illuminated by the fire was bones, hundreds of them. It was like a group of cats had come here to stash their ill-gotten gifts for their masters that had forsaken them. Every few inches lay a bone, and no two bones appeared to be the same. Sure there were similar types, but none of them the same. You had bones that were cleanly cut, looking like they were severed with ease by whatever horrifying instrument was deployed. Then there were broken ones, some broken once, some in many places. Have you ever picked up a twig on a hike and broken it every inch of so down the twig untl you have turned a serene piece of the scenery into a curled mess of broken fixation? 

Many looked like that. Some had pieces carved out of them, leaving hollow holes like gaping wounds where the bone should have persisted, even through death. Every step I took I was forced step on the remains of some form of life that had most likely met its end in this unholy place. Throughout all these bones there was pint after pint of blood. Some looked more fresh than other bits, with one disturbing puddle even being new enough to still be running down the small rise in land it had found itself on. The blood of this unfortunate being even still trying to escape this place past the time of its eradication. And finally, hanging over the fire, words were suspended in a black tar substance of some kind. The letters looked like fresh spray paint that had been left by an artist that never intended for it to remain. The droplets that attempted to escape retracted and extended actively as I watched these two haunted words hang in the air, attached to nothing: 

Round One. 

As soon as I had registered the words suspended in animation in front of me the flame shot up violently and engulfed the words, lighting the mucus tar-like substance of on fire. As the words burned bright, I felt the purest form of terror I had ever experienced travel from head to toe. My hair stood up in the way lightning strike survivors describe the warning their own physical self gives them before they find out they are the tallest thing in the area. 

I want to go home, I want to be curled up in a blanket I haven't washed in weeks laying on a pillow I cognitive dissonance myself into believing isn't covered in my alcoholic drool that I'm sure I produce every night. I wanted to go back to my paycheck-to-paycheck retail job that barely made ends meet. That red eye man has no clue what he is talking about anyways. I wasn't as bad as he was trying to make me out to be. I never directly harmed people, right? I've never been to jail, never committed any crazy violent acts aside from your typical fist fights that most people have been in. Yea I kind of sucked sometimes, but so do most people right? 

I didn't deserve this; there are so many people that deserve to be in this situation before me. I can't die right now, I just can't right? I have never been afraid of the act of dying, but the concept of what comes after terrifies me. Is there really a pit of eternal fire waiting for me? Will I get reincarnated as a bug? Will I become a ghost that gets to haunt people that irritated me? 

As these thoughts raced through my head the fire started to diminish, but not back to its regular form. Instead, it continued to die out until there was one single burning coal at the bottom of it all. Still burning bright, but solitude despite it being surrounded. The coal was fighting hard, occasionally popping a true flame back into existence until the fog seemed to suffocate it and compress it until its desperate fight against the fog was lost. But the coal remained, the coal burned bright, the coal persisted. I finally looked back up and recoiled at the sight I had in front of me. 

Between 10-20 men in white suits with red eyes surrounded me. I quickly looked in all directions, confirming there was no opening in the grouping of men that stood shoulder to shoulder. They also all had the same facial expression on their faces. One of complete lack of emotion, complete straight faced. Why did that bother me so much? Was it the lack of emotion? Was it that I had only seen this facial expression in animated TV shows? As I was thinking about everything happening, one man stepped forward from the circle. 

"You have chosen this route, and now you must prove yourself worthy. The challenge has been accepted, the battlefield has been activated. You alone choose whether your soul is saved from a form of damnation beyond comprehension." 

This was all said in a matter-of-fact tone with his facial expression not changing except to enunciate the statement of battle he had prepared for me. But that changed during his next sentence, as he smiled at something that seemed cruel in its ability to mock me. 

"You really think you stand a chance kid? We know what kind of life you lived, this is not the place for someone like you. You should've taken the easy out when it was given to you. Hell are you even smart enough to have realized when you ran away that you would be choosing to play the game? Or did you just run like the terrified little peon I know you to be?" 

My face must have given something away because he smiled even wider and continued. 

"Holy shit that is what happened isn't it? You didn't even realize! You had no clue! Oh man, that's priceless, wow. I hadn't even thought about that until seeing that stupid look on your face. But yea wow it all makes sense now. Here I was thinking ok, maybe this kid does have some balls. But NOPE, you just didn't have enough self-control to make a well thought out decision. Idiot." 

The worst part is he was right, I hadn't really considered what option I would be choosing when I decided to run. I had just ran. Yet again this red eyed man seemed to be able to say exactly what was needed to throw me off, make me uneasy, or worse completely demolish my ability to process what was happening around me. How did he know so much about me? How was this possible? I thought back to the laughter when I thought I was having a bad acid trip. That could still be possible, right? It would be one way for these entities to know what to say and mess me up right? My subconscious would be pulling things that it knows would effect me and attempting to process what is happening instead of numbing my brain like I normally do. 

During this internal struggle I noticed two of the red eyed men had slowly backed away into the fog, never taking their eyes off me. The rest of the motley crew of suited men held their positions and did not move. There was now a gap, not a big one mind you, but it did exist. Maybe I could use it to escape? The one that was speaking earlier addressed me again. 

"Enough of this prelude, if you are going to go unceremoniously, I would rather just get it over with. Let's all be real here, you aren't going to put up a fight. Round one is very simple however. You may exit this circle now. Once you do, you have one singular minute to hide. Once that minute is up, we will hunt you. If you survive for two minutes, you move on to round two. 

I stared at him blankly for a few seconds before finally uttering the two words that were obviously the most terrifying "H-hunt me?" 

He rolled his eyes, clearly annoyed with me. 

"Yes, hunt. H-U-N-T hunt. What part of that is confusing to you? You will run, we will try to end your life. It is a very simple concept. Maybe your stupid little pea brain is still confused, but until told otherwise everything you do will be deadly to some extent." 

After this sentence ends every man in the circle pulls out a knife of some variety. Some were butcher knives, some were box cutters, some knives had hooks on the end, and all of them looked sharp even through fog. 

With a slight grin on his face, he twirled the butterfly knife in his right hand and softly said "Begin." 

I ran, I ran hard, and I ran with abandon. I didn't bother shielding my face this time. I needed to see what was ahead and above. For a few seconds it was just pure panic but then I think my desire for survival kicked in. Survival comes natural to us all, but not many of us are tested on it when it comes to a setting like this. Your average person on this earth will never stare death in the face, instead death will come from within. It will wither them away and eat at them until what they once knew as themselves is a far-gone memory as they lay begging for one more day, one more hour, one more breath. But what I was doing was staring death in the face. Death had announced its presence in my life and issued me a decree of battle that I had no choice but to accept. Two choices remained in my life for the foreseeable future. One of panicked life, or of deplorable death. Death wasn't the easier option here from what I had heard. The game had started whether I liked it or not, which meant if I lost, I was facing both former options combined into one horrifying cacophony of terror. 

This was all running through my mind as I gazed upward into the trees. I needed to run like hell and then climb something with leaves on it and other trees nearby. Climbing a tree would secure me the high ground, nearby trees might make it possible for me to transfer trees if the high ground isn't enough, and leaves on the trees might make it so I am hidden from below. Not only did it seem like my best option, but it also truly seemed like my only option. I figured at this point I had another solid 30 seconds, which is not a lot, but could be enough if I had run far enough. I checked over my shoulder to confirm that I couldn't see the silhouette of anyone and then started climbing a tree that seemed to meet my qualifications. 

It started out worse than I expected, with multiple branches breaking as I tried to climb them. By the time I started hearing movement through the foliage, I was not confident in my position. However, this was the best chance I was going to get. I positioned myself where there was a complete covering of leaves below me, as well as most angles to the ground. Far too many hours of first-person shooter games had taught me to not just pay attention to direct lines, but to the alternate angles of attack. I didn't have any weapons on me, I could throw the things I had brought with me as I did still have those in my possession. Why didn't I pick up some rocks? I could have used those as ways to reach the people coming up. Hell, it was only 2 minutes, right? Realistically at least 15 seconds had passed since I first heard movement. I probably needed to survive a solid 90 seconds, and I would move on to whatever comes next. 

The movement, why can't I hear it anymore? 

*Knock knock* 

*Knock knock* 

It took me a few seconds to register what was happening, but the men below me were knocking on the tree with the butt of whatever object they had in their hands. Why were they doing that? It reminded me of when you knock on something to see if it is hollow or has something inside of it. 

They were getting closer. 

*Knock knock* 

I heard the knocks start to converge on me, them using the exact same method on every tree they came across. Two knocks, quick succession, then move on. I couldn't see how close they were because part of the plan was for them not to be able to see me. 

*Knock knock* 

What do I even do here? Will my tree sound different because I am in it? Surely not, right? That's not a thing. A tree won't sound different depending on how many squirrels are in it or how many bird nests there are. But also, when was the last time I went knocking on trees? 

*Knock knock* 

They had to be close to my tree, any second now the knock would come, I would feel the vibrations travel up my temporary sanctuary, and hope to hell that would be the end of it. At least a minute had to have passed by now since they started. I could do this, it's just sixty seconds. 

It happened. 

*Knock knock* 

Everything stopped as I felt the tree sway ever so slightly as the force of whatever object the potential assailant was using to hit against the tree. And to my utter dismay and absolute horror, so did everything else. All the other residual knocking I had heard from other people checking the trees stopped as soon as my tree was touched. 

The leaves and branches around me exploded to life as objects pierced the leafy shelter I had found myself. I couldn't figure out what was happening until I felt a searing pain in my side. I screamed out in pain before I could stop myself as I looked down and realized there was a knife embedded in the left side of my stomach. That's what was happening, they were throwing their knives into my tree with the hope to find me, and they had been successful. 

Amidst my pain I realized my tree was shaking and swaying far more than it had been before. 

Fuck, they are climbing my tree. They know exactly where I am and they have more than enough time to come up here and push blades into whatever vital organs they wish until my worthless life is ended with the deserving amount of pain. I tried to climb up more but the pain in my side was too much. It wasn't a large knife that had found my location, but it was enough to where I couldn't remove it without a plan to stop the bleeding. I had to just leave it in as I tried to navigate a way to climb to a nearby tree. 

There was a branch that looked relatively solid that ended within a few feet of me. It was the only hope I saw now, I couldn't bear to move up, moving down was a death sentence, so let's move laterally. Being quiet mattered little to me in this moment so as I reached out to branch, I wasn't holding back the scream of anguish that came out of me as the pocketknife stuck in my stomach moved around with my climbing form. Occasionally I would hear another object crash through the leaves and branches around me, but I think they had my moment going in the opposite direction. I had crossed over around the center of the tree to get to the branch I had found and I don't think they had expected that. I still heard the climbing though, as soon as they reached where I was they would have a clear view of me and be able to do whatever they wanted to be able to reach me. I yelped in pain again as the knife stuck into my flesh brushed against a branch as I transferred to yet another tree, trying to create some true separation from my original position and the one I needed to stay in. 

Someone grabbed my arm and immediately I felt yet another instance of brutal and sharp pain, I screamed in agony as my hand lit aflame with pain. I looked to my right and saw a man in a white suit with a large grin on his face as he reached into his pocket to pull out another knife. My hand is stuck, holy shit my hand is attached to this tree because the knife went completely through my palm. 

"This was too easy, I almost wish you had put up more of a fight. Oh well, I'm going to get a few seconds of fun time in before it is all said and done." He laughs a bit as he says this and pulls out a knife that sliced through leaves cleanly as he pulled it out and positioned it. A long deep cut that seared the back of my hand with its blade that delivered its users judgement with no hesitation or resistance as I screamed in agony.

Without thinking about it I reached over and pulled out the knife that had attached my hand to the tree. Blood ran down my arm as the cut and the puncture intertwined their respective prizes within each other. I tried to back away, but the pain was blinding and I missed the branch I was going for, starting my rapid decent back to mother earth and the waiting arms and blades of the company of attackers that had decided to grace me with their presence. 

As the branches broke around me and the knife stuck inside of me got a bit of extra action there wasn't much time for thought. My instincts got me as far as being able to twist my body so when I hit the ground the side that had the knife in it was facing away from the ground. I also had time to be grateful I had only made it 10-15 feet in the air before my limp and injured form smacked the ground. As I groaned in agony I looked around and was surprised to see no suits, no red eyes, and no knives coming to end my existence. I rolled to look around briefly, nothing. 

As I stood up slowly, again confirming I am alone. I concluded that this knife inside of me had to go. There was no way I was going to survive this with an extra appendage sticking out of me. I rationalized that if I used my shirt as a tourniquet and tied it uncomfortably tight around my waist, I could stop the bleeding and be fine. I know you are not supposed to pull out things stuck in you, but this was not your typical situation. I took my shirt off and in the moment I was blinded by the shirt, I felt it. 

There was a sharp point touching my neck. Sharp enough where I felt blood immediately travel down my neck. I heard laughter as I finished pulling my shirt off and stared directly into the eyes of the man who had his knife pressed against my throat. 

 *How the fuck hasn't it been two minutes yet?* 

He laughed and spat out the venomous words "How the ever-loving fuck are you going to make yourself blind while you are literally being hunted? You've got to be the dumbest, most pathetic, most waste of life human I have eve-" 

A horn sounded, not like an air horn exactly, more like a tornado warning. Its long echoing tones reverberated around the forest and off the trees like a sad siren of old looking for its final victim.

The knife retracted, it no longer was cutting into my throat. I look behind me and all the white suited men are standing there behind me. Just the one remains in front of me, the one that held the knife to my throat. He smiles at me. 

"Looks like you got lucky in round one, we will see how round two goes for you." He said with a grin. 

"Why are you doing this to me? I just came here to hike!" I cried out, pain lancing up and down my hand and arm, knife still sticking out of me. 

No answer besides one simple sentence.

"Round two starts in five minutes."

And that's when my phone buzzed.
