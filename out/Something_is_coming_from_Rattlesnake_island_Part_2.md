Rick’s mother had raced to his room after hearing thrashing around and loud banging. When she finally got the door unlocked she said the room looked like it was chewed up and spit out by some giant. The desk and wardrobe were gutted, trash and clothes lay everywhere. The drawers from the desk and wardrobe were scattered on the green carpet floor and his closet had been torn through almost completely. Only a couple flannel shirts, a suit jacket and the remains of two sweaters hung in his small closet. My aunt said she was convinced a group of people came in, ransacked his room and took him. She said the damage was shocking. Rick was a pretty strong guy too, so it would be hard to overpower him alone. She said she was worried he got in with the wrong kind of people and that he might have been on drugs, or owed money, and a large number of other theories. 

Another week and a half after that, a fishing charter found his body in the middle of the lake. The autopsy report said his lungs were full of water, and declared death by drowning. There were no bruises or signs of a struggle on him, no cuts or drugs or anything that suggested kidnapping. It was as if he turned his room upside down just to walk into the lake forever. I couldn’t believe it. When I had seen him barely four weeks earlier he seemed just fine, a little grumpy sure, but I thought that he was ok. Rick’s mother told us that she would be holding a service for him. So, three days after she called us, we found ourselves passing through Alton again, on our way to my aunt’s house .

When we arrived we settled in and she told us about the situation. Apparently, his attitude got worse and worse after we left. She said, 

“I would hear the back door opening at some horrible hours in the night. And some steps down the path in the back, I think it was Rick sneaking out, but I don’t know what it would be for. I would not have cared if he was sneaking out but I don’t like the fact that he was hiding something from me.” She trailed off, thinking hard about what her son couldn’t share with her.

“What was it?” I gasped, intently listening to every detail and realized I blurted out loud when everyone was quiet.

“Uh… I don’t know, I had thought he was sneaking out to meet a girl, or do drugs or something like that, you know, teenager stuff. But, well… one night, if this wasn’t some dream, I remember sitting up in bed and looking out of my window, towards the lake. The moon was full and it was bright enough that at the bottom of the light, I could see a shadow of a boy. My boy, just standing at the water's edge. He was looking out into the lake and I- I can only imagine w-w-what he might have been doing…" She was then overcome with a fit of tears and unable to continue.

Her story almost gave me some hope. *Was he looking at the island? Was he thinking of returning it? Did he ever try to bring it back?*  I asked myself, although I could only assume the same as his mother, that he got involved with some bad company or worse, those guys from the island came to take back what was theirs.

The day after we arrived we went to a funeral home, which was a little pale brick building, just big enough for the small service. Rick laid inside a large mahogany casket, but his face bothered me. Usually the bodies look peaceful and blank, but his face was one of euphoria. It wasn’t very obvious, but I felt as though his lips were slightly upturned in an eerie smile. I pulled myself away as Rick's mother began to read his eulogy. Rick’s mother, father-in-law, and my mother all spoke and said beautiful things, of which I am sure he would have been very happy to hear, but I couldn’t get his uncanny face out of my mind. I told myself it was just a trick my brain was playing on me to cope. We drove back to my aunt’s place to rest up before we had to go back south the next morning, but the strange feeling stuck to me. Before we went to bed my aunt suggested that I take a look at some of Rick’s clothes, the ones still intact at least, in case I wanted some to remember him by. I said I would take a look and walked into his now empty, still room. It felt so strange being in the same room we would play Playstation 2 in and fight over who got to play as Zangief. Rick would always win, simply reminding me that it was his Playstation so he gets to choose first. Any refusal on my part to be player two would be countered by him holding the controller high over his head and out of my reach. I would give anything to play with him right now, even if it meant getting stuck with Guile.

In his closet he had about a dozen flannels, and as I was searching for any that I might like, I grabbed the side of one and when I pulled it I felt a hard, palm sized object in the pocket. My heart skipped a beat then made up for it twice over. With my ears pounding I pulled the red and black flannel shirt back towards me and flipped open the pocket. I looked inside and there was a small turquoise pearl. The same one we found on the island. I licked my lips to try and hydrate my now bone dry mouth. I slowly pushed the jacket back towards the back of the closet. My hands were trembling at the sight of it but I stopped, holding it there in the silence of the room a thought overtook me like a tsunami: this thing had to do with his death. I don’t know how it could be connected but I don’t believe that it was coincidence that he took it and then died so shortly after.  

*He had it this whole time? Was he considering taking it back or did they try to take it back from him by force? If that’s true he might have been right, oh my god what do I do? Should I tell the police it may be a murder and not a suicide? Do I even mention it to the police? To my aunt? To anyone? What would it do now?* I felt like my head was about to pop with all the different thoughts cramming up my brain. I needed some air. I creeped across the short hard carpet and out the back door. I stumbled down onto the beach and sat about 3 feet from the water. As the waves were crashing and the cool summer air relaxed me, my shaking stopped and I realized I was still holding the stone. In the moonlight it glistened and I thought about what to do with it. If those robed cultist guys killed Rick for the stone I would never forgive them, much less return their stuff to them. But If it was a suicide, then maybe his mother would like some closure, even if it meant she hates us for going on that island.

I sat on the soft beach, my dirty crocs filled with sand. I looked out onto rattlesnake and glared at it as hard as I could, trying my best to put it together. Going to that island led to his death, but how? Maybe they grouped up and decided to come take it back by force? Amidst the rhythmic laps of the waves there was a faint abnormal noise that grabbed my attention. I whipped my head up to see what it was. I saw nothing but the rolling water and I had a feeling I was getting too tired to be out there that late. I almost stood when I heard another splash and when I looked up this time my heart dropped almost enough to kill me.

In the waves about 20 feet out, two bright eyes looked back at me. At first I thought the cultists were here for me now, but they wore no robes. I leapt up and scrutinized the marbly black water as intensely as I could. There was a girl in the water.

Her long dark hair floated on the surface around her head like an oil spill, deeper than the black water, smooth, waving, and glistening. Her pitch black, glistening eyes were the only features visible above the water. I thought she might have been unconscious, since her eyes had a strange filmy look, but when I took a step forward she sank lower and narrowed her brow. My confusion turned to a thin cold dread that manifested in chilling beads of sweat dripping all over me.

I pivoted to run, taking two swift steps and then I blinked for less than a moment. I opened my eyes and was back where I had started, facing the lake and the woman in the water. I turned again to run, wondering if I had simply imagined it in my fear but I saw my two footsteps away from the beach, and a couple more that led to where I was standing. I couldn't even take another full step before I blinked again, and after what seemed like less than a moment I found myself standing in the water. It went up to my ankles and I dropped to the ground shaking hard. I wasn’t moving by myself. Before I could think of what to do or even get up, I felt overwhelmingly tired, like in a dream when you can't seem to work your body right or even look in the right direction. I dreamed of standing and walking home, into the water that would warm me, and comfort me.  I tripped and fell face first instead, getting to my knees and shaking off the sleepiness, I pushed myself halfway onto my feet when my eyes thrust themselves upwards under my eyelids.

I found myself as far as shoulder deep. The relatively small waves were now persuading my body up and down with each tide. I reached up to keep myself afloat when the pearl in my pocket knocked against my hand. It felt unnaturally heavy, and I grabbed it to hurl it into the lake, just to get its weight off of me. When I gripped it my fatigue passed for an instant. The girl dropped beneath the surface and I tried to push myself out of the water as fast as I could. I was kicking my feet faster and faster, and I saw the smooth reflective skin of her back break the surface as it approached. A gray, scaled appendage fluttered above the surface and its fleshy, lunate back end splashed into the water. Amid my frantic kicking and thrashing to get away, I felt a warm painful shock to the back of my head. I had slammed into the large rocks around the edges of the beach. Thankfully, I stayed conscious and I pulled myself onto my feet. It jetted through the water and raised its red, lipless mouth that was stretched open in desperation. It was crammed with serrated teeth and scarred flesh, and I was prepared to be torn to ribbons. 

In a final act with nothing else coming to mind, I gripped the oversized bead with every ounce of power I had, raised it up behind my right shoulder as the thing’s eyes stabbed into me. I pelted the pearl as hard as I possibly could straight at its face. In my weakened and wet state, my form wasn’t perfect, but the missile found its target. The pearl smacked against her face and it wailed in a blood chilling shriek that sounded like a mix between fear and fury. Then it wrenched itself into the depths, barely leaving a ripple. I had expected it to tear into me, to pay me back for the slight I had made against it and the damage I had done, but after that screech I was alone on the beach, I couldn’t even find its piercing eyes in the water. I crawled back onto the soft sand and began to make my way off the beach. I wanted to process what happened, but I couldn’t risk that thing coming back and persuading me towards the water again. So, while still shaking, I slowly crept back up towards the house.

I snuck back in as quietly as I had snuck out and took my place in the guest room thinking I didn't disturb a soul. I fought the thing again and again in some dreams, but in others I am chasing it while it drags Rick down under the water. In the morning my aunt proved me otherwise. She pulled me aside and asked, 

“Why did you sneak out last night, especially after what I told you?”

I said to her, “I thought I might find out what Rick had been doing down there.” When I told her this her eyes became slightly glossed as they had so many times recently. Then the pain in her eyes changed, she looked at me and asked again

“What did you do down there, boy?” She had never used this tone with me. It would usually have scared me into spilling my guts, but I thought about those people on the island. If they had a hand in this then it could be dangerous sharing that information with her, I don’t know what a cult might do to keep their secrets, or worse, I might know already. Instead of saying everything, I gave a half truth, 

“I was looking for clues that may tell us what happened to Rick.” It actually wasn't far off from the truth, but I still felt like a little kid playing detective. She nodded and said, 

“I appreciate the help, but we need to be careful until we hear more from the inves- investig…” she was again interrupted by a fit of weak tears and I wrapped my arms around her to comfort her.  She told me I was a good nephew and told me to be safe on my drive home, gave me a final hug and waved us goodbye.

On the drive home I was so caught up in wondering what that thing could have been that I missed two exits on the way. I racked my brain but within the seven and a half hours of driving I couldn’t think of a single more logical explanation for what happened other than that it was a dream. If I ignore the still wet shorts in my bag, the soreness at the back of my head, and the fact that the very real pearl is nowhere to be found, it’s easy to write that night off as one really bad dream. As much as I would have liked to, I had a feeling in the pit of my stomach that that thing had something to do with Rick’s death. 

I’ve kept up with the case online since then and I check local news for any word on Rick. I also text and call my aunt quite often and ask questions about the investigation and how things are going. She told me that the police haven't exactly ruled foul play out, but are struggling to find evidence. They said that they couldn’t find any fingerprints in Rick’s room other than his and his mom’s. Because of this, the most likely conclusion they’ll come to will be suicide. If I didn’t know what I do now, it would be easier to believe them, to believe that Rick had taken his own life, but what I saw that night convinced me otherwise.

After that night I just wish I could never think of it again. I wish I could say that that little rock was all it took to take that thing down, but I’d just be an idiot. I still have no clue what to do, but that is why I need answers, I need to know what that thing was, why my cousin disappeared, who those people were on that island. Since I’ve gotten back I have been scouring the internet but I can't find anything. No articles, no photos, no similar cults, not even a single conspiracy theory. I can’t even find what Rattlesnake Island was being used for by the government. I'm at my wit’s end. The only things I do know is what I hear from Lake Rines and the area around it. I researched the history of the lake and the towns that border it, but nothing helped. The one piece of information that I have a bad feeling about came from a local newspaper in that area. It’s how I know something in that lake is still a threat: *The Granite State Tribune* reported that the drownings in Lake Rines have doubled this year.
