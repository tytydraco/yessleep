(tw:shooting,bullying, death)

  
first day of elementary school is something that is very blurry to me. i was young and cannot remember a lot besides a boy in my class who was very distant from other kids. he didn't talk much yet got good grades for his level which is what i heard. i wasn't focused on him because i was young and he seemed normal from a 6 year old's prespective. life was good at that age for me i met my friend caroline back then and we have never gone back. caroline was my rock we would trick or treat together, spend christmas with each other, sit together in class and lunch, and had sleepovers regularly. i cannot complain about elementary school.

middle school. middle school was weird it was a time when everyone's brain were finally starting to develop to the point of being able to remember things and comprehend situations. again like in elementary that boy was there, still quiet and distant from others. the boy had more attention drawn to him from others who thought he was weird because he never talked. nobody would say it to him though they would laugh and point sometimes or "accidentally" trip him or push him. i noticed it but didn't want to put myself in the mix of silent bullying. i was more focused on finally reaching women-hood with my best friend caroline. me and caroline finally started fitting into bras and upgraded our closets together. we would sit on our new phones and call every night and even celebrated our 13th birthday together because our birthdays were a day apart. 

as we reached the summer before high-school there were pages being made bullying kids from my school. people who weren't "normal" would be posted with mean captions. there were multiple videos about the boy who didn't talk much. they were ruthlessly calling him names and making fun of the fact he didn't associate with the rest of us. i closed my phone and didn't think about that page nor did i report it when we finally reached the high-school building.

high-school. i was ready for high-school to be my prime with football games, parties , social events it was everything i was waiting for. the bullying only increased in highschool but i would turn a blind eye to it because i didn't want it to be me next or have people be against me. in my senior year only months before i started collage at a school id worked so hard for something had happened to change my life and many others. it was any other day at school i was on the first floor just entering my english class to start the day. me and caroline drove to school together in her new honda her mom got her. as i waited for the announcements to play i heard a sound of glass breaking and then silence.

the class went silent and we waited for another noise to occur. suddenly we hear an announcement play over the loud speaker which made my heart drop. we were going into a lockdown, which wasn't a drill. i remembered having drills for this moment but adrenaline kicked in and i blanked out not knowing what to do besides panic. as i was looking in the room for a spot to hide multiple round were going off in the halls echoing from the 3rd floor all the way down to the first. the teacher barricaded the door as me and one other student climbed into the steel closet near the corner of the class while the rest scrambled to find a spot. as i sat in that closet texting my parents what was going on and telling them i loved them we hear our doorknob jingling. i held my breath while the other student with me did the same. i hear a shot go off and the door burst open, i pushed my hands over my mouth to stop and air or gasps from coming out. screaming, shots, wet noises, and crying was all i heard from outside the closet. a 10 second event felt like an hour. once the gunman left the room i texted caroline telling her i loved her and asking if shes okay. it took the police 30 minutes to come to the school and find the shooter. as the police entered the room i was in, they yelled if anyone was in here and i yelled for help. i don't want to think about what that classroom looked like but walking out and my feet being covered in red is something i want to keep buried forever. as soon and i left the school i saw my parents outside crying holding each other and ran to them.

  
days after the incident  the news was on and i sat with my parents to watch it. reporters announced the gunman had taken his own life after police found him with a note in his pocket being found after. the killer was the guy i had grown up with, the quiet one. the note was lengthy but it was focused on the main points of what led him to do this and the bullying he had faced with nobody doing anything to stop it.

 the guilt has been eating me since i had heard that note. i had to speak on the news about bullying and my side of the story. i had to talk about how i lost my other half in this shooting. i had to talk about how i cant sleep at night due to the reoccuring dream that i could have died. i have to learn how to live life without my bestfriend because i couldn't have said or did something to help this bullying stop. now i am in collage in my 4th year and still think about this. i am scared to even think about this happening again.
