Last Friday, my mom walked into my room. She wanted to talk about my friendship with Abby.
She asked me if I knew what had happened to her. I said no.
Then she changed the question: she asked if I knew why it happened.
I froze, because my mom isn’t like that. She’s usually straightforward.

But she’s been weird lately.
My mom’s never been someone who cares much about looks. She’s not sloppy, she just doesn’t spend hours obsessing in front of the mirror. But last week? She’s been fixing herself up like something big was about to happen. Something important.
One day, I passed by the bathroom and saw her dyeing her blonde hair dark brown. I stared at her, her eyes looking as dark as the dye in her hands.

— “Mom?”
— “Yes, dear?” she said.
— “Why are you dyeing your hair? Is there something special at mass today?” I asked.
— “No, just… changing things up. Sometimes it’s good to refresh, you know?” she answered.

I let it go and went back to my room with the apple I grabbed from the kitchen. I thought everything was normal. Until last night.
I really thought things would be fine, that Abby would just come back. That maybe her parents had sent her away for a while so people would forget the gossip about her being with a guy. But that she’d return soon.

It was 11:26 when I checked the clock. Sunday.
I was thinking about Abby.
We used to skip mass together. On a normal Sunday, she’d be here, and we’d be laughing about something dumb, nothing worth remembering.

I got up and sat at my dresser. Stared at some pictures of us, then opened the drawer and grabbed one of the cigarettes she left hidden at my place.
Abby was always terrified of her parents — especially her mom. Cold, strict, never cruel exactly, but heartless. She wouldn’t think twice about making her daughter pray until her knees bled. And I know that because I was the one cleaning the blood when Abby hid at my house, where no one could see.

My mom was a housewife, but she was never home. Always out drinking tea with neighbors or babysitting their kids.
My dad spent his life at the church, preaching somewhere, anywhere.

So I sat on the window ledge, autumn breeze on my face, smoke burning down my throat.
I heard something outside. At first I thought it was just people coming back from mass. But the sounds got louder. Not one person, not a family — a crowd.

And then I saw it: a procession of people, walking with candles.
Familiar faces, but they scared the hell out of me.
And everything fell apart when I saw who was leading them: Abby, next to a man with dark hair.
She was wearing a long veil, walking beside him in a white dress.

That’s when I realized: it was a wedding.

I couldn’t process it. Couldn’t understand why this was happening. My cheeks were wet, burning hot. I collapsed to the floor, numb, like I wasn’t in my own body anymore. And yet I could feel everything.
My hair stuck to the sweat on my neck.
My breathing.
The hot air coming out of my nose.
I felt my body heavy against the old carpet, but my thoughts… broken shards.

I don’t know how long I stayed there. Long enough to feel like the floor and my body had merged into one.
When I got up, I tried to understand how, or at least why, any of this was happening.

So I decided I’d go to her house in the morning.

When the sun came up, my mom stormed into my room.
“What are you doing here? You’re supposed to be at school! I told you to go to class,” she snapped, throwing a shirt in my face.

I got up, even though I hadn’t slept a second. And then it hit me — the angry face staring back at me was the same one I had seen in that creepy procession last night.

I didn’t say anything. I just put the shirt on, grabbed an apple, and headed to Abby’s. I knew she wouldn’t be at school. And I knew her parents wouldn’t be home either.

The whole way there I kept wondering if maybe I was just hallucinating. Maybe my brain was playing tricks on me because of Abby’s disappearance. Maybe it was just fear poisoning my thoughts.

But when I knocked on her door, the neighborhood was dead silent. Dry bushes, cold air. I knocked again. Nothing.
So I went to the window. Looked empty. I’d only been to her house a few times — we never liked being there. But I knew the second window on the right was her room.

So I climbed in. The house was freezing. The moldy smell was disgusting, clinging to my throat. The house was clean, but the air was heavy, hard to breathe. I pushed forward anyway. Her room was empty. Then I walked down the hallway. And that’s when I saw her.

Abby, standing at the end, holding a bowl of grapes.
For a second, I felt this insane joy, like all my paranoia had been fake. But then my eyes fell to her stomach.

Something was there. A mark. A shape I couldn’t quite make out. But whatever it was, it was revolting. My body gave out, and I slid against the wall.

When she realized I was real, her eyes widened, the grapes hit the floor, and she rushed to me. She held me up, even though I tried desperately to avoid her touch — it made my skin crawl.

We sat there in silence. The longer I stayed, the heavier the air got. I was terrified it would get so heavy I’d suffocate right there beside her. Maybe that would’ve counted as self-asphyxiation. But I stayed anyway.

Finally, she spoke:
“I’m someone’s wife now.”

I threw up. Right there. She just stared at me. Her eyes weren’t hers anymore. I knew it wasn’t her choice.

Then she kept going:
“It sounds weird, but he’s a good man. He can teach me my worth. And yesterday was just a celebration, like I said.”

I staggered to my feet, nauseous, dizzy.
“I saw you! Who were those people? Who was that man?” I demanded, swallowing down another wave of vomit.

“What? What people?” she asked, confused. But then her confusion shifted into some excuse.
“You mean the outdoor mass yesterday?”

“You never go to fucking mass! And I’m not talking about some church service — I’m talking about that cult you were walking with!” I yelled.

“I don’t know about any cult,” she said calmly. “But if you mean the outdoor mass, that was just… a celebration. My engagement.”

Before she could finish, I had already jumped out the window. I biked as fast as I could, my brain racing. Why had they done this? Was it all in her head?

I pushed harder. When I stopped on an empty road, I finally looked down. My arm was shredded open, blood blazing against the white of my dress. So bright it could’ve been seen for miles. The glass shards in my skin sparkled like glitter.

That’s when I realized: I’d smashed through a window with my own arm trying to escape.
When I made it home, I dug my hand into the wound. The sticky wet feeling was disgusting, but I pulled the shards out myself anyway.

Something inside me knew I couldn’t tell my parents what happened. I felt something about them. I knew something was wrong. Abby would never do this. She wasn’t the only teenage girl sneaking around with a guy. The most I thought would happen was her being sent away for a while, not locked up and vanished at seventeen.
That’s insane. Even for my town.

That night, when I finally fell asleep, something happened. I woke up lying on something soft. I stood and realized I was in a field of daisies. In the distance, a church. Familiar.
I walked toward it. The closer I got, the more the familiarity rotted into disgust. The smell of smoke filled my lungs. When I stepped inside the old church, nausea hit me hard.

At the altar, I turned and saw thousands of people. The church warped into the local one. My dad was there, staring me down. Everyone was singing, chanting. And Abby was beside me, in a wet dress, hugging herself, shaking violently. Nobody said a word — just prayed, louder and louder.

The sound got unbearable. She collapsed at my side, pitiful, innocent, like a deer burning alive. I tried to comfort her, but it only made things worse.

Then I was thrown back. My parents walking toward me. A massive black veil slammed me against the ground. My head cracked.

I woke up, sweating, paralyzed. My head pounded. But when I looked — nothing. Just my room.

And then I saw her. Abby. Standing at my window, like it was any other night. But it was almost 4 a.m.
When I opened it, she came in. Walked straight past me, silent. Stood there staring. Then dropped to the floor, convulsing. Her eyes were black. Blood pouring from her nose.

I froze. Couldn’t move. Sweat dripped down my freezing body. When I finally managed to reach her, I touched her shoulder. That’s when I felt it. A mark. Raised against her skin, like the one on her stomach. A cross. Burned into her.

When I traced it, a shock ripped through me. My head throbbed, splitting pain, and then… nothing. Black.

When I woke up, it felt like a nightmare. But I knew it wasn’t. The stench of rot still filled my room, burning what little life and hope I had left. Bloodstains still on the carpet — small, but real.

I’m writing this now at the library computer.
I don’t know what’s happening.
But it’s getting worse.
And I’m scared.

PS:Thank you for your concern and advice. This has made me think that there is still sanity in the world outside of this shithole of a city.
