Bugs.

Love em, hate em. Better get used to them. Because soon we‚Äôll be eating bugs for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Deep fried, baked, barbecued, covered in chocolate or fresh off the grill. And not just those plump, juicy bugs either. Nope. I‚Äôm talking cockroaches, maggots, slugs, worms and snails, although I suppose some of you already eat snails, plus bugs that don't even exist yet.

How do I know this? Simple. I‚Äôve been shown the future. But I‚Äôm just a teenager, right? What do I know?I‚Äôll tell you what I know, and you‚Äôd be wise to take heed. A great change is upon us. Except, there‚Äôs nothing great about it. Horrific is more like it. Damnation, perhaps. In fact, our fate is so gruesome, I feel obligated to warn others, just as I‚Äôve been warned. Take it or leave it, it‚Äôs up to you.

The warnings arrived shortly after Dad left. I was seven. Lucky me. Over the years, Mom rarely spoke of Dad, and the few times I saw him, he seemed worried, like the weight of the world was resting upon his shoulders. Looking back, I can see why. Turns out, he knew things. Terrible things.

BEWARE THE BUGS <&>

This was typed neatly on a note, and left in my lunch bag, jammed between two bologna sandwiches. As you can imagine, I freaked out.

‚ÄúBugs?‚Äù my mind went berserk. ‚ÄúWhat bugs? I don‚Äôt see any bugs!‚Äù

I scavenged through my lunch, searching for bugs, destroying the food in the process. Needless to say, I didn‚Äôt eat that day. Instead, I went home hangry (hungry and angry), demanding answers from my unsuspecting mother, who threatened to call the school. Clearly, she had nothing to do with the note. We don‚Äôt even own a printer.

The next time it happened I was playing in the sandbox with Lyla, who lived in the unit next to us. Lyla ran home for some snacks. I followed her, giving her specific instructions on what cookies I preferred. She pushed me away, saying I was being annoying. Ouch. When I returned to the sandbox, something was scribbled in the sand:

BEWARE THE BUGS <&>

My blood ran cold, my fists clenched into tiny balls of fury. Someone was lurking in the sandbox. But who? I looked everywhere, sure it was Buster, the local bully. But Buster was nowhere to be found. Neither was anyone else.

BEWARE THE BUGS <&>

What did it mean? While searching the sandbox for crawling critters, Lyla returned, and handed me a Freezie. Then she jumped inside the sandbox, ruining the message. I almost confided in her. It was on the tip of my tongue. But I never did. Even at age eight, I knew this topic was taboo.

By the time I reached middle school, the frequency of the warnings increased. Something I wasn‚Äôt prepared for. Deep down, I figured they‚Äôd stop once I reached my teens, thinking they were a figment of my overzealous imagination. If only this were true.One morning, for instance, I awoke to find a crisp, folded piece of paper placed neatly on my dresser. My heart fell to the floor. Someone had been lurking in my bedroom in the wee hours of the night. Someone or something. Cautiously, I crept along the creaky floor, toward the note. Then, I gasped.

BEWARE THE BUGS <&>

Unlike the previous warnings, this one provided a photograph: Filthy bugs, greenish-black, with alien antennas and little legs for crawling. I‚Äôd never seen such sickly creatures, with their beady eyes and silver wings. They were so gross, I scurried to the washroom and vomited.From then on, my life was riddled with anxiety. I even told my mother, who laughed and called me names. When I persisted, she threatened to take me to the doctor, whom I feared more than the bugs. Scared but undeterred, I stuffed the paper into a binder, and shoved it deep inside my closet.Not long later, it happened again.I‚Äôd come home from school, fatally exhausted and needing a nap, when I discovered the note hidden underneath my pillow:

BEWARE THE BUGS <&>

Again, a picture was provided. These bugs seemed otherworldly, with their speckled eyes, sharp-looking shells, and skeletal wings; they had long antennas that twisted tightly at the tips, like springs on a Pogo stick. Whatever they were, I didn‚Äôt trust them. What troubled me most were their claws, which could tear your eyeballs from their sockets.Questions crowded my inquisitive mind. Like, who put them there? And why? I was terrified. I longed for my mother to call the police. But she was too busy doing whatever it is adults do. So, I put the paper into the binder. Then I tried to nap, which didn‚Äôt go well. When sleep finally came, I was bombarded with nightmares; bugs as big as baseballs crawling across my soft skin, scampering inside my nostrils, worming into my brain. I woke up screaming.

Sometime around Christmas, I got a surprise visit from my father, who came bearing gifts. I was thrilled. Underneath a stack of video games was a smattering of books. Being thirteen, I tossed the books aside, and went straight for the video games. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I discovered the significance of those books. Dad, who looked older than his years, treated us to tacos, and stayed the night. When I woke up, he was gone.

That was the last time I saw my father.High school was hell on earth. The other kids didn‚Äôt like me. They still don‚Äôt. To be fair, my high school career got off to a rough start. During week one, I was surprised by another warning: A bag full of bugs. Most were dead, but some of them were still alive, making crunching noises, which gave me the creeps. So much so, I puked all over my books. Oh, how the kids teased me. That‚Äôs when I finally reached out and told Lyla. Big mistake. For her, this was the final straw. Our friendship was over. I won‚Äôt go into detail, but by then she was hanging out with the Cool Crowd, leaving me alone to fend for myself.

The warnings persisted; sometimes as random texts, or secretly-placed notes where only I‚Äôd discover them. Once, I stepped out of the shower, and BEWARE THE BUGS <&> was scribbled on the steamy glass mirror. I shrieked. For starters, Mom wasn‚Äôt home. I was alone. Not only that, the bathroom door was locked.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called out, stupidly, not expecting an answer. Still, I tip-toed across the apartment, sure I‚Äôd find the culprit. I didn‚Äôt, of course, and soon gave up trying.Although I was growing increasingly anxious, never once did I question my own sanity. You see, these warnings were real. Real as rain. Instead, I found solstice in video games. Anything to take my mind off those buggish warnings. This worked for a while. Kinda. Then something happened that changed everything. That day was December 31, 2022.

My mother threw a New Year‚Äôs Eve party, inviting all of her friends. I stayed up with them, emceeing the party, until I got bored. Watching adults getting drunk and belligerent is not my idea of a good time. Thus, I retreated to the confines of my bedroom, where another warning was lurking.

On my bed was the black book my father had given me some years earlier. It was open. The page showed a swarm of bugs, each varying in size and shape. Apparently, it was an encyclopaedia of sorts, dedicated solely to bugs. As I flipped through the glossy pages, grossed out by the plethora of bugs, something came over me: A knowing. This book wasn‚Äôt from our time. It was from the future. I checked the publishing date. Just as I suspected: 2056.

My head hit the ceiling. My mind went numb. I must‚Äôve blacked out, because I awoke sometime later, just in time for the countdown. Mother and her friends were pretty lit by then, and forced me out of bed. Afterwards, when I returned to my bedroom, two more books awaited me. One was paper thin; the other, a paperback.My hands trembled as I flipped through the skinny book, my eyes jumping from their sockets. This wasn‚Äôt a book. It was a menu. A menu for eating bugs. In it, I read:

Grasshopper Salad: $33.99. Chocolate-covered Bed Bugs: 36.99. Cockroach Cargo: $67.99. Beer Battered Blood Suckers: $69.99, A DEAL!!!I gagged. This couldn‚Äôt be true. But there it was. I felt hot and cold at the same time. My palms were sweaty, my mouth desert-dry. At the back of the menu was a brief description of the so-called restaurant. I tried reading it, but I had to put it down. My mind couldn‚Äôt handle it. Nor could my stomach. Besides, the other book was taunting me, with its orange cover, declaring two-o‚Äôclock. The book was The Time Traveler's Almanac.

Time travel? What does time traveling have to do with anything?

I riffled through the book at once. To my surprise, my father‚Äôs signature was on the inside, along with a note:

Best of luck, Zack!

Hope these books don‚Äôt BUG you üòâ

Love eternal,Dad

I nearly fainted. Everything suddenly made sense: My father was a time traveler. No wonder he was so mysterious. And old. He was trying to warn me. I wished he‚Äôd just pull me aside and told me. But then again, how does one confess such monstrosities?

I sent my father a series of emails, asking for more information. My emails remained unanswered, until recently, when he replied with a pair of articles, published July 9, 2042:

BUGS ARE DELICIOUS AND NUTRITIOUS; followed by: ARE BUGS THE NEW GOURMET?

The article scared me stupid. I‚Äôm still scared. Upon much consideration, I‚Äôve decided not to disclose too much information. You see, I‚Äôm stuck between wanting to warn the public‚Ä¶more like shake them to the core‚Ä¶and not wanting to alter history. It‚Äôs a paradox. One I could do without, thank-you-very-much.I will say this: I fear for our world. Why? Because we‚Äôre on the brink of starvation. In the not-so-distant future, healthy food will be as sparse as gold nuggets. Something bad is on the horizon. Farmlands across the world will perish. Drought, famine, you name it. It‚Äôs coming. Soon we‚Äôll be forced to eat‚Ä¶you guessed it‚Ä¶BUGS.

That‚Äôs not the worse part. There‚Äôs more.Just yesterday, my father sent another stark warning: A news article from 2083. Apparently, a bug-based diet has unexpected consequences: Human beings are mutating. Our average IQ has plummeted. We‚Äôve become slobbering idiots. Plus, we‚Äôre growing tentacles and other abnormalities.

Sorry, I wish this weren‚Äôt true. But it is. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving you this warning. If only I was older, with more resources, maybe I could put a stop to this. But I‚Äôve just turned seventeen. I‚Äôve still got another year of high school. So, with a heavy heart, I‚Äôll leave you with one final warning, same one I‚Äôve been given time and time again:
