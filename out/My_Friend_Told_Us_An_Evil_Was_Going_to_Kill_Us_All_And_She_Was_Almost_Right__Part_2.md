It was a long, dark, steep, and slippery drive up the foothills of the mountains to Maye’s house. She had no address. She lived on a logging road that snaked up into endless forest in a little cabin.

Smoke billowed out the top of the house. There were no lights on. We worried the old man had beaten us there and possibly already burned down the place with Maye inside. 

We sat in the car, nervously debating what to do until the door of Maye’s cabin slowly opened and we saw a short woman standing there with a wild plume of hair, a candle in her hand providing the only light. She motioned for us to come in. 

The inside of Maye’s cabin was short, murky, and cluttered - kind of just like her. *I was not relieved that apparently the only person who could save us looked like she couldn’t properly groom or bathe herself -* I thought as she locked the front door behind us and took the three of us in. 

“Would you feel more comfortable if a psychic looked like a businessman?” Maye asked me specifically, making hard eye contact. 

“What?” I barely got out the response. 

“I know what you were thinking, but what do you want me to look like, professional, or something?” Maye explained, salty. 

Maye was right. I guess I wanted my psychic or medium or whatever she was to look like one. It would be actually weirder and less comforting if she looked like she had her shit together.

“I started exorcising people when I was your age. Do you want me to look like Heather Locklear?” Maye went on, still looking at me. 

“Who?” All three of the younger people in the room shot back. 

“You don’t have time to mess around like this,” Maye explained as she had us sit down in her living room. 

We watched Maye down a few pills and then struggled to maintain consciousness. She woke herself up with a terrible-smelling hand-rolled cigarette and took a deep breath. 

“The old man isn’t who really wants to kill all of you,” Maye explained, breathing out that foul smoke. “It’s simply an evil that overtook him. It had his wife too. Well, until you burned her to death. That evil won’t simply forget that.”

*Okay, great, so what we’re we supposed to do?* My thoughts continued. 

“You have to lure him here. If you get him into my basement. I can exorcize, but that’s the only place I’ll be stronger than it,” Maye answered my internal thoughts. 

“He’s already on his way here,” Rochelle announced. “I can feel it.”

Maye reached over and put her hand on Rochelle’s shoulder. 

“You have some of it,” Maye said quietly. 

Maye looked to the rest of the group. 

“Who wants to volunteer to be the bait to get it into the basement?” Maye asked with a slight smile. 

Mike volunteered. Bo was usually the bravest of us. He was next in line with her no longer with us. 

Maye and Rochelle started to shiver right after Mike agreed. The old man was coming up the driveway. He was right by our car. 

“He’s cutting the fuel line,” Maye whispered just before she turned the lights of the cabin off. 

“He’s breaking the windows,” Rochelle added on. 

We heard glass break just outside right when Rochelle finished her statement. 

Maye motioned for Mike to go. We watched him slip out the door and into the cold darkness outside. 

We waited quietly and patiently. The entrance to the basement was outside. All we had to go off of was if we would hear the cellar door to the basement open, which is where Mike was instructed to take the old man by Maye. Then we could go down and Maye would try to exorcise the demon out of the old man. We would do our best to help. 

We immediately heard a struggle. I started to naturally drift toward the door. 

I could feel Maye telling me not to do that. Mike was either going to get that man down into the basement or he wasn’t. No need to drag more souls into it. 

We heard a scream from outside. It was far too deep to be from Mike. Which was a good sign, but also reminded me of how ridiculous it was that we just sent out a lone 13-year-old to fight an old man. 

A window broke and we saw Mike and the old man smash through the glass next to the front door. Mike was small and young, but he was strong and a fighter, he had the old man by his neck.

Mike gave us all a look in the dark that told us that he had control of the situation, and then he yanked the old man away and out of the sight. 

It was time to go down to the basement. I was excited to actually avenge Bo.I went down the stairs with energy. It picked up when I heard Mike’s voice calling out for us to get down there and help him. He had the old man subdued. 

I moved down the stairs with confidence until I realized Maye and Rochelle weren’t following me. I whipped around to see them at the top of the stairs behind me. 

Maye and Rochelle looked scared. I followed their eyes back down into the basement where I saw a fire in the corner of the room, illuminating the space. 

Standing in front of the fire was the old man, holding onto a horrified Mike, a knife to Mike’s neck. *The evil had won back the upper hand.* 

I felt Maye calling me to step back. I started walking backwards up the stairs until I felt Maye drift past me. 

“Stay back,” Maye whispered to me just after passing by. 

I listened. So did Rochelle. We watched Maye slow descend down into the dark and dirty basement space below. 

I saw the old man’s eyes start to darken and his brow furrowed. He looked worried all of the sudden. 

In the blink of an eye - Maye was across the room and right on the old man. The shock caused the old man to let go of Mike and drop the knife. 

I watched as Maye shoved her face towards the old man’s face. He tried to fight her off, but wasn’t able - they were face-to-face, just inches apart in just a few seconds. 

Mike took the opening and moved quickly to where Rochelle and I stood on the stairs. 

The three of us watched Maye pin the old man to the ground. 

But suddenly, Maybe started to seem thrown off and the old man’s voice dribbled out of his mouth pathetically. 

“What is happening?” 

Maye suddenly stopped. The room went silent except for the sound of the old man starting to cry. 

Maye’s eyes were anything but comforting when she looked up at me. *Something was wrong, clearly.* 

I again followed her eyes, this time behind me, and saw that Mike was gone.

\-

The old man was confused, scared, and tired. Maye made it clear to Rochelle and I - the evil had left the old man, but it had gone into Mike. 

Maye assured Rochelle and I that nothing good would come of the evil moving into Mike. He’d kill someone. Kill himself. Get himself killed. It wasn’t going to end well. 

*The question was where he would go?* 

Rochelle assured us he would come right back to her. He had finally confessed his love to her the night before. She had rebuked him, just wanting to be friends. He was crushed and not taking no for an answer. 

He’d circle back for her. She knew that. We would just have to wait. That night. 

Maye took Rochelle and I with the old man into the living room in the house. She turned every light in the cabin on and out on the porch, hoping to draw Mike into us like a moth to a flame. 

Maye then went into the kitchen with the old man, warming him up with hot tea and explaining to him what had happened to his life. Rochelle and I sat by the fire by ourselves, I think really taking the time to absorb the hideous death of Bo for the first time. 

It was just when the thought of that old man in the kitchen killing Bo with a blowtorch truly came into my head. I believed Maye’s explanation that he was overtaken with the evil, but I still blamed him, and I wondered if he was playing dumb. 

I was ready to get up and confront the old man when I realized we had let something slip. We forgot about the window Mike and the old man had broken and it appeared Mike had slipped through said broken window, getting the jump on us. 

Rochelle realized it too, she moved next to me and stared down Mike as he stood there just inside the broken window looking fierce and tensed in a way he never had before. He was always the soft guy. 

I got the sense there was nothing we could do if Mike decided to make a run at us, especially after I saw that knife the old man was using against him in his grasp. 

Mike made his initial move at us with the knife.

“Mike, I!” I yelled at him. 

Rochelle stepped in front of me, cutting me off. 

“Mike…”

Her voice froze Mike in his frantic tracks, so quickly he almost fell over and onto us. 

“Mike…I love you,” Rochelle went on. 

Rochelle’s words softened Mike a little. His gaze wasn’t quite as steely as he stood before us. 

“You’re my best friend, Mike. You know I love you. You know I’d do anything for you,” Rochelle said as she started to cry. 

Mike continued to soften, but he didn’t let go of that knife and his muscles stayed tense. 

“Mike, please,” Rochelle went on, starting to weep, with desperation choking her voice. 

I felt Rochelle’s bravery start to beam off of her, even before she stepped forward and put her arms out in Mike’s direction. *Oh my God, she was going in for a hug.* 

Rochelle successfully landed the hug. She got her hands around Mike. I watched as she whispered things into his ear. 

I watched as he dropped the knife. 

I watched as he returned Rochelle’s hug. 

The room suddenly felt a lot lighter. 

\-

Maye cleared Mike. Rochelle had cleared the evil out of him. She truly believed the evil was dead. 

The hard part was the defeat of Mike’s evil was a short-lived celebration. We now had to deal with the reality of Bo’s death. 

Maye agreed with us. We didn’t trust the old man’s ignorance. We immediately made an anonymous tip to the police about him in Bo’s case. 

Things happened quickly. Bo was buried. The old man was arrested. Mike, Rochelle, and I were sent to therapy. 

The therapy helped. But what really helped us heal was the three of us spending every waking second together that we could and pulling each other through it. 

Things were going fairly well until Rochelle summoned Mike and I to her house late at night. 

She was terrified. She had seen someone creeping out her window and noticed it was Bo’s sister’s boyfriend. 

No one had seen him since the night of Bo’s murder and we all had forgotten about what sounded like the struggle between him and the old man that night. 

*Had the evil spread from the old man to Bo’s sister’s boyfriend that night? Had he actually been the one to kill Bo?*

*Why did we wonder that specifically?* 

Because he was carrying a propane torch the night Rochelle saw him out her window, the kind they believed Bo was killed by.
