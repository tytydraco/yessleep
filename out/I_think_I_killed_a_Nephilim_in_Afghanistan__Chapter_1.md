I was a SAW gunner in an infantry unit stationed at a forward operating base (FOB) in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan, from 2002 to 2003. It was an 18-month deployment, and we were already 7 months in when all this started to happen.

My assistant gunner/ammo bitch, Dan, came over to my cot at around midnight. He shook me awake gently and said in a hushed tone, “Hey… bruh, get up, it's our shift.” I groaned, shot him a middle finger, and started lacing up my boots and putting my blouse on. The sides of my plate carrier velcroed tight against my ribs, and my Kevlar slung on top of my head. I picked up my 249, and we shuffled outside.

It’s strange, this place was undoubtedly a shithole, but the sky out at night was brighter than any place I’ve been since. Even the darkness of the night seemed richer; the constellations looked like a thousand holes poked into a velvet sheet. I kept my eyes up as I stumbled toward the watch tower to the right of our entry control point.

It was a shabby little building about the size of those concrete pillars that hold up bridges. Its shitty concrete walls were reinforced with pieces of rebar that randomly jutted out just enough that I had to point my chin down as I entered so I wouldn’t get hit in the face again. I made my way up the sand-caked ladder and took my seat at the observation deck. Another typical night in hell.

To the left of the FOB was a small rocky outcropping (about 5 clicks away), to the right was a little village (about 7 clicks away) with about 20 families and heavy Taliban resistance, and to our front was a mountain range (about 1 click away). Our FOB was strategically located at the base of the mountain so that the likely avenues of approach from the Taliban would either be from the village or along the road that separated them from us.

I checked my sectors of fire, did a quick radio check, and then settled into my position looking down my sight. Dan sat there next to me with his arms folded up against his chest. It was quiet, which was always a good sign. Every 5 minutes or so I would dart my eyes to the left and check the rocky outcrop, then fix my eyes toward the village, then up toward the mountain, and down toward the road.

Left.

Right.

Up.

Down.

Wait…

Left.

Right.

Up.

Down.

Wait…

Left.

Right.

Up… Wait a minute.

"Hey Dan, are you seeing that?"

He leaned forward and squinted his eyes. "It looks like a ball of light..."

I saw a pulse of orange and yellow from near the top of the mountain. I grabbed my radio, “Lionheart 6, this is Lionheart 2, we have a light on top of Mt. K, azimuth 234 degrees at 1100 meters. Over.”

There was a long pause. Finally, I heard a raspy voice on the other side of the radio, “Lionheart 2, this is Lionheart 6. Can you get a positive ID on the light source? Over.”

“Roger that, stand by. Over.” I flipped down the night vision goggles on my helmet and tried to peer into the darkness. It was too far. All I could see was a small ball of light steadily bouncing across the darkness. Too irregular to be a flashlight. Too strange in movement to be a vehicle. It looked like a torch.

"What the fuck kind of Taliban is using a torch in the middle of the night, less than 1200 meters from a US Army base?" I kept my eyes fixed on the mountain, "This dude’s gotta be out of his fucking mind. Welp, no more Man-love Mondays for youuuuu."

“Lionheart 6, this is Lionheart 2. It appears to be a torch or flame of some sort moving laterally across the mountain top. -Break- Individual is not cresting the mountain top, so I can’t get a positive ID, but… wait… The light just disappeared. Over.”

What was this? It had to be a huge flame for me to see it so clearly from this distance. Maybe it was one of the villagers? No, that didn’t make any sense. It had to be an enemy combatant. Maybe the Taliban were trying to set up for an attack. But... why did it go out? They couldn’t have seen me from this distance even if they had NODs too.

The radio kicked back on, “Lionheart 2, this is Lionheart 6. Good copy, keep your eyes fixed on the location, and draw a sector sketch of where they appear to have gone. Turn it in at the end of your shift. We’ll send a patrol out tomorrow night. Over.”

“Roger. Over and Out.”

Dan and I sat there staring for a while. What was that? If it were a Taliban group, where did they come from? The intel guys told us that the mountain was so steep and treacherous that it required mountaineering gear to scale. Even if they had the equipment, they didn't have the training to do night ops and go up a 1000-foot cliff. "That's pretty fuckin' crazy, man", Dan ripped his beanie off and rubbed his head.

"I bet you it was one of those villagers, man - I knew there had to be a mole in the village. They probably housed them and then sneaked them up on the mountain. There's probably tunnels or some Vietcong shit they made." I gritted my teeth as I went on complaining. I was pissed off. We'd been here for 7 months already, and gotten shot at nearly every day without actually having stopped any insurgents. It seemed like for every one we killed, 6 more would pop up. If there were any up there... we were gonna get 'em.

But still... I felt weird. This place was a warzone, but no one uses torches here. Were they doing some ritual sacrifices in the mountains, carrying torches and killing goats? There had to be an explanation. There was no way any human being would be up on that mountain at night without being afraid of us coming to get them.

It turns out I was right. It wasn't a human being. And it wasn't afraid of us.
