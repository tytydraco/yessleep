Guess who has a personal laptop now and doesn't have to subject themselves to strange looks at the library?

Now I'll be able to post here more frequently and maybe properly answer your comments.

If you missed my last post [I strongly suggest you read it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c878q3/hell_survival_manual_dont_fuck_with_fallen_angels/)

A lot has happened this past week. I almost lost a finger trying to open a frozen pack of meat with an old knife, got enough money for a crappy computer, and even a proper, *slightly used* bed! But before I delve into my horrible memories covered in sulfur, there are a few things I need to clarify.

It was brought to my attention that even though I talk a lot about myself, I kind of forgot to say anything about me, so yeah, I guess a little introduction is long overdue.

You all can call me Nate, short for Nathaniel.

When I died, I was 35 years old. After that, I remained 35 for a few centuries.

The concept of age kind of loses its importance when you die, one of the few positives, I'd say.

Without beating around the bush, I'm not a good person. If I were, all these posts wouldn't exist, after all.

Before I died, I would have never admitted to this. I was blinded by greed and pride. I probably would have said some bullshit like, "I'm not evil, just realistic. In today's world, to stay on top, you must keep others down."

I ask not to be glorified in any part of this. I remember several occasions that would make you realize what a shitty person I am, even though I'm currently trying to change.

Anyway, we'll have plenty more time to talk about me after we get the important things out of the way. Today's post is important, so pay attention, and remember:

When the moon dissapear in Lust, Beware the one who sings in the dark.

The Circle of Lust is considered by many as the vestibule to the abyss. Almost all newcomers, with very few exceptions, fall into it when crossing the thin veil of reality upon death.

It is essentially a mixed zone that combines small samplings of everything the 9 circles offer, an area mainly populated by low-caste demons, small fallen angels, and newcomers, most of whom are desperate for an exit and have no idea what to expect there.

Therefore, Lust is used as a hunting ground by various things, from demons to even humans.

Perhaps if I had known how low humans had to sink to survive in that place, I would have been more cautious and wouldn't have suffered so much.

It had been some time since I was taken from the clutches of my captor; some flashes came to my mind: the recurring torture sessions, that person appearing without any indication, the descent down the spire wall, where I was tied to their body like a backpack.

The path I was being led through was tortuous, ahead of me lay plains of obsidian covered by a thin layer of ashes. In the distance, a chain of twisted mountains stretched toward the sky.

For a moment, I allowed myself to falter. I thought I was being rescued and taken to some kind of refuge. I imagined myself filling my belly with succulent meats, sleeping on a soft bed, and quenching my thirst with pure, crystalline water.

Friends aren't tied up.

When I noticed the tightly twisted wire in my hands and feet, I tried to protest, to throw myself off their back, to cut myself free. But I was terribly weak. The person carrying me noticed that I was awake.

I still remember perfectly my first interaction with that sneaky son of a bitch:

"Look who woke up! You're very unlucky, you know? Angel's plaything in the first few days, huh! And they say ***I*** don't stand a chance in this place."

I couldn't see his face behind all the cloths, but I had the feeling he was smiling.

"Who are you, where are you taking me?"

"My, my, such rude fresh meat, not even a hi or hello, shit I would accept a how was your day!"

"It's not like you're being very polite now."

"Hey, I'm a veteran so I get a pass."

"Do you want to tell me where the fuck you're taking me already? I'm not playing games with you man!"

"Neither am I, young fella. You, my friend, are Jack's property now! You were on his turf, you know, so now he gets to do whatever he fucking wants with you!"

"Turf? I was being eaten alive by some horse-monster creepy hybrid all the way up that giant thing! How does that constitute as his turf? Please, I just want to go home and see my wife."

That dirty rat let out a laugh, interrupted by a horrible dry cough.

"Home? This is your home now, buddy. Haven't you realized yet, poor thing? That's why you became an angelic snack. There's not a single good screw in that empty head of yours! But don't worry, even useless ones like you have a place in Jack's empire. Just wait until I deliver you. He'll be so proud! Maybe he'll even give me my own wife, a little plaything just for me!"

No matter how much I struggled, I couldn't free myself. Fatigue and hunger took their toll. All I could think about was this Jack character. I had no plans of being taken so easily, but until I recovered, there wasn't much I could do.

For hours, we walked beneath the turbulent clouds of Gehenna. Occasionally, a cacophony of deep, uninterrupted cries would emerge in the distance. During these moments, my new captor would lay still on the ground and cover himself with dust.

Something was following us.

My limited experience with infernal beings told me that we couldn't stay still. My heart raced every second we stayed there, exposed, motionless on the ground, but I dared not express my discontent. I feared that whatever that thing was, it could hear me and find us.

At that moment, I was in a sea of emotions, part of me relieved to have left the spire, another part terribly scared of not knowing what fate awaited me at the end of our journey.

It felt like I was out of the frying pan and into the fire.

As we resumed our path I noticed that, for the first time, the sky was clearing.

We were far enough from the cursed city to escape its influence. Looking back, I could see the perfect, unnatural circle of clouds covering Gehenna and the surrounding areas. I could see insect-like beasts flying towards the city, drawn to it like moths to a flame, making it their lair, their hunting grounds, and forever home.

But for some reason, I felt that going that far off the metropolis was equally dangerous. Maybe it was the stillness in the air, maybe the messed-up situation I've found myself in, but all of my senses were on high alert and didn't seem to want to calm down anytime soon.

The clear sky gave me my first ever vision of the moon, or if you wanna follow the locals, the eye of behemoth.

A gigantic globe of flesh up in the sky, stare at it too much and you figure out why they call it an eye. It seems to watch your every move once you're out of the city bounds, like some kind of twisted guard.

My captor didn't seem to mind its presence, but I couldn't take my eyes off it, the way it pulsated every once in a while. 

It felt ***alive*** and ***conscious***. 

After some time walking, we got to some kind of camp made in haste, a few big loose rocks put together in a tent formation, an unlit bonfire, and what seemed to be beds made out of black leaves and ragged clothes. 

Didn't look comfortable at all.

That rat threw me on the ground by the bonfire and sat inside the "tent."

"Now, my dear fella, we will wait for the other collectors, which might take a while. So behave, and no loud noises, got it? Or else your one-way ticket to the Silver City will have to be revoked, 'cause you'll be dead. I'll cut your throat and eat you right here."

"Eat me? What kind of sick bastard are you?"

"The kind that stays alive no matter what. And if you keep on babbling like that, I won't be the only problem you'll have to face."

As if following a cue, the loud and deep cries of some creature echoed in the distance. 

I made sure to lower my voice after that.

"What the fuck was that?"

"Shut up if you don't want to find out!"

I wanted to ask about Jack, the Silver City, the collectors, but my fear spoke louder than my curiosity, so I just gave up and waited, not knowing what was hunting us in the dark.

The Eye was growing ever so slightly by the minute, its vision a constant reminder that safety was but an illusion, bound to break anytime soon.

As if confirming my fears, the eye once again began to change, this time growing darker and darker, as if its flesh was spoiling before my very eyes.

"Oh crap, not now!"

That moment, I knew we were in some deep shit.

The sinner looked at me, considered something on his head an gave up.

"Well, you're in luck, pal. I can't afford to let you die after all the trouble I went through just to get you here."

He said, getting up in a hurry and pushing me inside the tent.

"What is happening? Why is the moon... gone?"

Looking up, I couldn't see the eye anymore. I felt like it was still there somewhere, just so embraced by darkness it was impossible to find it.

Bit by bit, a strange shadow descended from the sky and into the land. Everything was engulfed in a cold void. 

  
I couldn't see. I tried to speak but was unable to hear my own voice. I couldn't even feel anything other than that cruel presence.

I don't think I will ever forget it. 

It was like I could *feel* its sadness. Something was circling the camp, taking gentle steps towards the middle. I was quivering, it was so cold that it hurt to breathe. I could barely think. 

And then, I heard it sing.  
  
The circle of Lust houses one of the most dangerous of the seven deadly sins, one of the biggest hunters of man and corrupters of heart.

The succubus.

Not *a* succubus. I'm talking about the original one, the primordial being that gave birth to the whole species.

The one that still haunts the human plane and was the inspiration for dozens of tales across the globe. 

The mermaid, the Huldra, the Liderc—all but facades of the same unholy being.

the same one that choose us as prey.

When it sang, I felt like I was using cocaine for the first time again ; the high was immediate and powerful.

It came in waves, lifting me up into the sky only to let me fall into despair.

I needed her.

I was nothing without her.

I tried to fight, to free myself and run towards endless joy and pleasure, but something kept me from doing it.

It started to sing louder and louder, getting angrier and sounding less angelic with each passing second. 

Suddenly, that dreamlike, almost orgasmic in nature state I was in changed into a complete nightmare.

It was no longer asking, It demanded my surrender.

My senses came back to me, only to bring me more pain. 

The first thing I saw was fire, covering my body and burning me alive. My skin was melting before my very eyes, my mind froze trying to understand the creature standing outside the tent.

The torso of a woman, hips and legs like those of a spider. Where its arms would be, two bat-like wings extended several feet in length. Its head reminded me of a perfect genderless mannequin, except it had no eyes, no ears, or nose, only one big circular mouth covering its entire face.

"Don't look at it! It will break your mind!"  
  
But it was already too late.

It was getting tired of waiting; I could feel its wrath. It no longer wished to toy with us; now it was going in for the kill. 

My mind was buzzing, I felt a killer migraine getting worse and worse. I felt the urge to vomit, blood  coming out of my nose.

We were about to die. 

But then, I heard a weird chant followed by a deafening shot.

The succubus screamed in pain, breaking the spell and rushing toward the newcomers.

"You guys took your sweet fucking time, didn't ya?"

With my blurred vision, I could barely see the group standing on top of the hill. I was able to distinguish black robes and torches; some were carrying rifles adorned with weird flowers.  
  
"Shut up and get your ass over here, Mice! We need to go, now!"

Once again, I was being carried away from danger, the buzzing of shots still roaring in my ears.

I could see other naked sinners, probably newcomers like me, chained up on top of an old modded pickup truck, with spikes and plates of metal all around it.

The last thing I remember before blacking out was the cry of pure rage from the succubus and a wave of pain passing through my body.

I really need to start getting ready for my shift now, so I guess I'll stop here for today.  
  
In any society, communities exist to create hope, a better future, and security for all. People get together to do the things they aren't able to do themselves. 

But in hell, as well as any other place, the corruption at the heart of humanity eventually breaks down every society, turning it into a play where only a selected few control the strings, and make sure everything works towards fulfilling their sadistic dreams.

Somehow, in the Silver City, things can get even worse. I was about to learn that.
