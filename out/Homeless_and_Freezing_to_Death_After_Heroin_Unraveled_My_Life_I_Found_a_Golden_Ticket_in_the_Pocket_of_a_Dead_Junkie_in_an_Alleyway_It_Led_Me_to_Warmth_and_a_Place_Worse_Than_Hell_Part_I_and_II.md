Heroin

The Mistress of Ruin.

She takes your emulsified form and melts you down like butter in a warm pan, and you welcome it.

Of course, in all my infinite wisdom, I thought it would be different for me. I had just passed the Illinois State Bar, and decided it would be harmless to snort some H at the party I threw afterward to celebrate.

Two years, three overdoses, and an eviction later, I was living on the winter streets of Chicago. A track mark-laden junkie, blasting off to Neptune any chance I got. My family tried to reach out and find me any way they could to get me into rehab, but the Mistress of Ruin had sunken her claws deep in me and I saw only her.

That was, until one afternoon, I found a golden ticket, stuffed into the pocket of a dead junkie in an alleyway.

I’m now free from one mistress, yet haunted by another.

One more even more sinister.

One even more deadly.

Because to know her is to know we haven’t the slightest clue what goes on in the corners of the world. It’s there, in the dark side of the mind, where she grows like a wild weed.

And she’s not alone. It won’t be long now before everything changes forever.

My name is Angelo Moretti, and this is my story of sobriety. From H, and from everything I thought I knew about the world.

This is how I found the city of Undehael.

I

I hadn’t been on the streets for more than a couple of days, and yet I was too high to plan for the negative twenty-degree windshield that had begun to blow in from the Northwest, and the shelters had filled their vacancies long before my eyelashes had begun to freeze. I received a tip about an alley that had a little tucked-away corner that was out of the wind. When I got there, some other homeless smackheads had already nestled in (probably from the same tip – our street dealer) and had lit some trash fires inside a few metal barrels. That way, they could warm their hands enough to guide needles into veins without too much of a fuss.

Other than my makeshift recliner (a wadded-up comforter from my bed in the apartment I had just been thrown out of and a trash bag full of recycled paper), I was blasted off, as usual.

The dealer had given us some good shit. These people were professional dope fiends and by looking at them you would’ve thought the shit had melted all of the bones in their bodies from within as they all lay there in the grime. I was no different.

I noticed a man a few feet away from me whose back wedged into the corner where the brick walls met. He held his palm out at me in want of what I had in mine, and I gave a lazy toss of the hypodermic toward him. It bounced on its plunger before toppling short of his feet. I heard the metal of the needle scrape filthy asphalt. He picked it up and rolled his sleeve above the elbow without wiping it clean.

We never exchanged a single word, but his eyes had struck me. Dirt smeared his hard-lined face and a dark, scraggly beard covered much of his gauntness, but those eyes; they held a sharp intelligence in them I hadn’t seen on this low side of the world that was now my own.

The dark eyes looked haunted. I'd guessed at the time that was why he was where he was, to fix that glint of despair; to dull some vague knowing of himself or his life he didn’t want to possess. It didn’t much matter.

Still, something in them reminded me of myself.

The H had hit me hard and pulled the light switch out on me, and when I awoke, the man was dead in his corner. His eyes had fixed their gaze to permanence on me, but the haunt in them had gone. They now looked… placid; peaceful. They looked like calm waters after a tempest had thrashed in them for far too long.

As I regarded the dead man, the sudden, awful odor of ammonia filled the air. My nose and eyes burned like hell. I strained to focus and look around, but I was still too fucked up to have my wits or do much of anything except lie there and look for the acrid odor’s source.

Within the fading light of the alleyway, the silhouette of a tall, thin man in a blue suit grew larger as he walked closer to our little den. His shoes clicked echoes with each step that hung in the air. Some of the others had also begun to rouse from their highs, and groggy heads turned to regard the man.

Once their eyes fixed themselves upon him, they rolled to the backs of their heads and their mouths froze open in silent screams. Their hands gnarled and curled at harsh angles before crumbling over rigid like a bunch of dead wasps.

I tried to collect myself; tried to prop myself up on all fours to stand and run, but I was still too scagged to go anywhere.

The man approached the dead junkie next to me and looked down at his lifeless body. That caustic smell – it was sickening. His suit looked clean and pressed, but outdated like it had maybe been in fashion during the late eighties or early nineties. The deepening shadows of twilight masked much of his face, but the fire’s flickering embers offered me teases of what seemed to be a tight, hard skin of a manilla color.

He sighed, knelt to the corpse, and placed a tender hand on his chest. “I’m sorry. I wish you wouldn’t have held onto it for so long, but I’m sorry this is how it ended.”

Another quite different voice spoke that sounded like it also came from the man, although I couldn’t see his mouth moving as the new words filled the alley. Unlike the soft, slight voice that had come from the man’s mouth, this one was much harsher and much less refined. “Jee-Zus.” The voice said. “I mean I get it, but he had to have known the guy would fold like this. Why did he even have us give the ticket to him?”

The man stood to his feet, gave a sullen downward glance, and shook his head.

“I don’t know.”

“Poor guy. Well, what do we do now?”

The man shook his head again, and then turned on his heels to look around for some vague discovery to which he was supposed to find but had been given no direction.

He scanned the paralyzed, silent screamers until he eventually trained his eyes on me. I was still lying there, dazed and doped up to all hell, but the only one conscious.

The disembodied voice croaked: “Holy shit. This one is still awake.”

The man approached me in the dark and knelt. Shadows filled the hollows of his gaunt face. His nose looked prosthetic and was a little off-color in contrast with his manilla skin. Although he didn’t look old, dead maybe but not much more than in his mid-forties, his sheer gauntness carved clear outlines of two sets of dentures around the folds of his lips.

He was horrible -- a nightmare in a bad dream.

I blurted an idiot moan of fear and tried to roll away from him.

“Get the fuck away from me!” I muttered as I kicked my feet out, shuffling my body against the trash-laden wall. The man remained knelt there with one knee on the ground and an arm propped on the other knee with his hand dangling casually.

He looked deep into my eyes as the dead junkie had before he had sent himself into the endless night. This man's eyes, however, did not match the horror that was the rest of his face. I saw a tenderness in them; a deep sadness; a pity-filled knowing I couldn’t quite understand at the time. He reached a comforting hand out to place it on my ankle. I kicked it away and made a vain attempt to scurry further away.

“There’s something in that man’s pocket over there, and I’ve reason to believe it’s for you,” he said. He pointed to the dead junkie. “His name was Michael and he was a lot more than what he became. I don’t know what’s planned for you, but I suspect you’ll look in that pocket of his one way or another, whether you want to or not.” He looked sorry as he spoke the words.

The man’s face darkened and the softness in his eyes turned stern and dire: “For now, I suspect he just wants you to see. Don’t lose heart. And don’t lose the coin. It will be your light in the dark. If you make it, I’ll be seeing you again.”

Terror and confusion had overwhelmed me beyond the point of action. I just lay there, with my back wedged against the wall. The man returned to his feet and the disembodied voice spoke again, “Alright, Billy. Let’s get out of here. I think we’re done.” With the man much closer, I thought I could see the knot of his tie speaking the words I couldn’t place before.

“Alright, Moor. Let’s go home.”

He turned around and walked back down the dark alleyway in the same direction from which he had come.

As he left, the patters of his shoes rang deep into my mind…

I sprung awake again. The nodders had left their rolled eyes and silent screams behind, seemingly unaware. They were back to doing all the degenerate things that got them there in the first place.

I scrambled to my feet, pressed my back against the wall, and looked over at the dead junkie who had calmed his haunted eyes with the needle moments before.

No, not moments before, I thought.

The skin had begun to turn hue to match the sharp coldness of the air, and those dark eyes had lightened and begun to cloud over.

I must’ve been out for at least several hours. He’d lain there and hardened his joints and the circus around us had continued.

My face lit wild and I darted the area for the strange nightmare man with the manilla skin.

Billy, I think it was.

But that had surely been a dream.

I’d remembered this Billy had mentioned something to me about something I had needed in his pocket.

A fix? Cute joke. A funny one too, because the punchline would be me – inevitably browsing the pockets of a dead man for theoretical smack – but I don’t think that was what he meant.

“Don’t lose heart. And don’t lose the coin,” he’d said to me. But before that, that other voice; something about hanging on to a ticket of some kind.

Trying to use the few neurons I had left in my poisoned mind for deciphering a drug-fueled dream seemed ridiculous to me, but those clouded dark eyes, once tempests, still fixed their gaze upon me.

I decided I had to get the fuck out of that alley. I would run to find some police so the officials could come to collect the poor bastard and take him to his final home, but first I needed to cover those eyes.

I grabbed a dirty tee shirt from the ground and laid it over his face.

My curiosity had gotten the better of me. I’d known it was absurd, but just maybe there was something in there, maybe even a free score…

I spidered some fingers into his coat’s breast pocket. There was some kind of card after all. I could feel frilled edges on some large, firm card paper.

I pulled it out and sure enough – a five-by-eight ticket, golden and glistening with the strands of light from the barrel fire’s flames.

I looked at the dead man again, and although he was now veiled with some horrid thing a prostitute had likely tossed aside, I could still feel his gaze from beneath the cloth.

Cold lead dropped in my stomach.

I looked more closely at the stamped writing on its front:

\*\*

ADMIT ONE

Subterranean Undehael - Waterworks

Tainted: The Norahdrin Chronicles

Angelo, that fire isn’t going to help you with the impending whiteout. It’s warm down there.

Go on in.

And hang on to the coin.

\*\*

Underneath the writing was a round insignia that stuck out from the paper a few millimeters. In its center was what looked to be at once an upturned, splayed man and a tree.

I dropped the card and stammered backward. No words were in my mind. It was too filled with animal panic.

I looked up and saw flurries traveling parallel to the ground with a gale of cold wind that not even the alleyway could break. The other junkies made languid attempts to shield themselves from the blast, and when it came for a second time and didn’t stop, they huddled together.

I looked back at the ground where I had dropped the ticket and then saw that it was in my hand again. I re-read the words that were directly to me: “Angelo, that fire isn’t going to help you with the impending whiteout,”

Next to the veiled dead man had appeared a copper hatch, tinged green with oxidation and large enough to fit through. I tottered closer. Steamed air billowed from its lid seam. As I drew nearer I could feel its humid warmth.

The frail moan of a man behind me cut through the wind, and I spun on my heels to see if the others noticed the steaming hatch.

“Do you see this here?” I yelled at them as I pointed to it. Winced eyes that looked as though they were in no mood for crazy ramblings paid me only a moment's attention before the handful of degenerates returned to their huddling.

I was almost certain I’d lost my mind; that H must’ve been a bad batch. Still, confusion and terror gripped me and I ran from the alley. Once I made it to the street, the wind nearly blew me off my feet.

I couldn’t see more than twenty feet in front of me. The few buildings I could get to had been sealed down and locked tight, and if anyone was watching me from within one of them, they gave no indication they would let me inside.

I had nowhere to go. I was done for if I stayed out in the open; probably done for in the alleyway if the blizzard lasted too long. I thought of the warmth that had radiated from the hatch and made my way back.

And when I returned -- it was waiting, billowing and beckoning and calling me forth.

My face was numb. My hands were numb. My feet were numb. I walked to it and stood above the lid. Thank God, warmth, but it wasn’t enough.

I turned to them once more – they were still hurdled with cold-blasted pain.

I was going to die out there with them if I didn’t go in. I’m ashamed to say that my main worry wasn’t actually the cold, or the cadaver man Billy and all of the impossible things that came along with him as he entered that alley. It wasn’t the strange hatch that had appeared out of nowhere. It wasn’t the ticket in my hand that refused to leave and seemed to know me and the weather forecast…

It was that I didn’t have any more H and didn’t know how long I’d be down there, hiding away from

I held the ticket out, not knowing what to do with it. The hatch sprung open with a slow yawn and when I looked back at my hand, the ticket burnt away to ash and all that was left was a coin bearing that same insignia. I put it in my jacket pocket.

Visible from the opening was the top rung rusted metal ladder, and sweet Jesus – that warmth again, stronger now and filled with life. A battle raged in my mind for a moment, and when I realized I had no choice, I turned one last time to yell for the others to join me. They offered me no more than a moment’s glance before going back to their terror and misery and doom.

They had dismissed me for mad. At the time I had thought they were likely right, but I didn’t much care. The heat I felt on my skin felt real enough, and even if this was my end, it was better than dying in misery.

I crawled into the hatch… and descended.

II

Dank air filled my lungs as I moved down the ladder.

A faint, yellow glow, somewhere below and out of sight, offered my eyes enough light to make out the vague shape of a stone walkway about fifteen feet down. Beside it, I saw golden twinkles from the light reflecting off running water.

I had made it about halfway down when the ladder turned to ash in my hands and beneath my feet, and I fell the rest of the way to damp, cobbled stone.

The hatch slammed shut above me, suddenly and furiously, snatching the grey winter night sky away as if to tell me the world I had been a part of was gone now; done. At least for me.

Lamps fixed upon stone walls, their incandescent bulbs offering dim light that revealed both mine and the other side of what seemed to be some sort of canal. Ahead of me about eighty or so feet – a causeway stretched over the water with domed shafts on either side.

That ticket… it said something about Under-- something, and Waterworks.

Behind me was a dead end, just an algae-caked grating that dark rushes of water flowed through, headed in the direction of the causeway. I paced back and forth beneath the ladder, trying and failing to come to grips with everything.

I thought about the other words on the card. Something about some kind of chronicles with some weird spelling. I thought about what the strange man had mentioned.

“For now, I suspect he just wants you to see…”

None of it made any sense. I had to be dying up there in the cold or from the smack, or both.

I fell to my knees and pitied myself.

And this is how it ends. What a waste.

I had resigned to my fate; to what I had finally done to myself after these two long years of dancing with my Mistress of Ruin.

A part of me was relieved.

After a while, I began walking the stone path along the water toward the causeway, when I heard the distant voices of what sounded like men.

The muffling of the distant echoes made it too hard to decipher their words, I could make out that there were at least two of them. They seemed to be prattling. They were coming from the leftward shaft ahead of me. The soft glow of lantern light began emanating from its opening. As the voices loudened, their words unclouded.

“ – Aye, the last time I was back in these ways I was chasing that damned Davies girl. Fuckin’ bitch slipped right out of me webs, she did,” A throaty voice said with an accent that wasn’t quite British.

A tighter, scratchier voice replied, less muddied but still thick with that strange accent. “Been that long? I wonder where the Assembly put her to serve Ol’ Mari for being so naughty?” The voice spasmed an ugly titter that rebounded from the walls more harshly than the rest of their words.

“I know where they put her.”

“Oh, you do, do you? Have an audience with the Assembly, eh?”

“I do. Well, not I — Argus knows one of the chamberlains in the Tunnel. To this day, she’s still in the Daughter’s Chair serving as steward until Lady Guinevere comes home to our Mother Marigold.”

The deeper voice sounded almost harmonious as he uttered the name of their mother.

The higher voice gave an incredulous squawk, “You say so?”

“Aye… poor girl.”

An eruption of laughter swelled in the passages as their light drew near the threshold of the shaft.

I pressed my back against the wet stone wall in a dim place that was in between two of the fixed lamps. I wasn’t quite shrouded in shadow, but with nowhere to hide it was the best concealment I was going to get.

They passed the threshold and came into view on the causeway. They weren’t men at all.

One stood large and broad and completely devoid of any hair. With clawed, webbed fingers, he held a strange and ornate lantern made of copper. His grey skin took his lantern light and wore it proudly with the sheen of an amphibian. Little ear holes burrowed in on the sides of his head. Thin lips and a mouth much too wide to belong to any man’s hung below two, minor nostril slits.

And above those -- beady, lidless black eyes with rings of flecked gold at their centers. They glimmered from the lantern’s light like ambers.

The other seemed to share the same general features but was smaller and slighter in frame. Atop his head, he wore a sheened fedora, its large brim masking much of his face.

Both dawned olive-colored trench coats that looked like they were made of vinyl or something waterproof.

Their long, rudder-like tails flittered from in between their coat seams and occasionally swept the floor.

The bigger one held the lantern out in front of them and they peered into the dead-end corridor inquisitively. “So, Twas you rubble, or another of the runners?” The smaller hollered to the dead-end corridor, sealing the words with a mirthy hiss.

Shadows had masked me for the moment, but I knew I didn’t have long. I thought about jumping across the canal, but fifteen feet? And without even a running start?

I could plunge into the water, I’d thought, but those creatures - those impossible things that could only exist in a child’s nightmare – seemed to be built for it.

With nerves wire tight, I decided my best chance was to stay put. Maybe I could use the skills I'd learned in law school to talk my way out of the situation.

It was all I had.

The two creatures moved a mere few steps forward before the bigger one spotted me. They approached and stopped about ten feet away. A sharp smile rose on the big one’s face, revealing a mass of needle-thin teeth in pink gums.

“It looks like it’s a runner… ye might get to show off yer handiwork yet, Danforth.”

Danforth quacked an excited little laugh. The big one went on, speaking directly to me now, “Go on, come on into the light so yer pal Burcher can have a good look at ye.”

Knowing I was exposed and - at least for the moment - helpless, I did as he asked, ghost white and hands shaking. My nerves felt like they had enough charge in them to jump a car battery.

Upon my revealing myself, they looked at each other with mildly confused glances. Burcher spoke again, “A big one… and ye’ve got that stinking fuzz on yer face. I don’t remember seeing the likes of ye brought in. How old are ye?” Genuine curiousness coated his question.

“I –don’t know what’s happening.”

I held my palms outward, displaying an unconscious attempt to diffuse what didn’t seem like it was going to be a friendly encounter.

“HOW OLD ARE YE!” Burcher snapped at me with a guttural growl underneath that told me there was as least as much monster beneath the surface as there was man, and that monster was prone to anger.

“I’m twenty-seven.” None of those smooth words I had planned were going to come to me, I was certain of that now.

“Twenty-seven? A full growner?” Danforth asked, disbelieving.

Burcher took a step forward and held the lantern out for a better look. He smelled like murky water and musk that reminded me of catfish.

“Ye lying to us, boy?”

“He isn’t lying. He’s even got a grey or two in that fuzz of his. Not much of a boy at all, is he?” The golden, flecked rings in their eyes glimmered as the lantern light reflected in them, like circles of fire in black, oily pools. With a brief clicking noise, translucent membranes flicked closed and open again in each of Burcher’s blazing beads to wet them.

“Look I just wanted out of the cold. The ladder, it jus—”

“What ye mean, ladder?” Burcher chopped the words right from my mouth with his question. Those dubious and mildly amused expressions on their faces snapped away in an instant.

“Where did ye hail from, boy that was?” He asked with a low, oiliness that almost sounded serene; that almost hid the sardonic tone beneath it.

A pause, and then Danforth joined in with the same sweet, sickly bemusement of his partner.

“Yes, boy nevermore… tell us where you came from.” The words from his mouth had tails on them, lingering in the air with nothing else but the gurgle of the canal’s running water to keep them company.

Without turning around, I pointed a trembling, dirty finger backward at the hatch I had crawled down from. “I came from up there…”

Their gold rings shifted up to where my finger led them for a moment and then returned to me, humorless.

I turned to look at where the hatch had been and there was nothing. Just damp, algae-covered stone and shadow.

“I was going to freeze to death… This man, he gave me this ticket that led me here through, that, I swear to Christ in heaven, was just there a moment ago! I — I can just go. It’s clear I’m trespassing here and I’ll just leave…” I was pleading now.

They stared at me in silence.

“Please… I won’t tell anyone about this place. I’m really terribly sorry.”

“Oh, we know you won’t tell anyone,” Danforth said.

Something about his words reminded me that I was talking to creatures that couldn’t exist in the real world.

I lowered my arms and cast a downward glance, “I’m dead, aren’t I?”

They only answered with bellows of hoarse laughter as if they had been caught off guard.

“A man, ye say?” Burcher asked with remnants of laughter still airing through his teeth.

I nodded.

“And what does this man look like?”

“He looks like a walking corpse, in a blue suit and a sandy-blonde, ivy league parted hair,” I replied. It was the most honest description I could possibly give.

They straightened again and exchanged glances, looking as though they were deciding whether to be concerned.

The smile that had taken a brief leave from Burcher’s thin lips curled back into place. “He didn’t do ye any favors by sending ye down here. And no, yer not dead. Although ye look like ye should have done yer old world a favor. Some bag of shit, are ye. I can smell the stink of poison in those pores.”

“There is no death in Undehael, boy nevermore. Not for your kind.” The gold-flecked rings darted back and forth in calculation beneath Danforth’s hat brim. “We ought to take him to the Assembly, so they can figure out what to do with his claims on how he got here.” His hat wobbled for a moment as if something alive stirred underneath it. With a swift, catching grab he fastened it back down again.

Burcher nodded in agreement. “Ye still wanting to brush up with some time with the knife? I don’t see a reason he can’t be in his skinnies when we take him in.”

Danforth nodded and lifted a sharp smile as his eyes trained on mine.

“Please, I didn’t ask for any of this. I just want to go home!” I began taking slow steps backward. Sick glee lit their faces and their smooth, grey tails twitched like excited worms. They stepped forward with each of my own backward paces.

“Danforth has brought something for ye, in case we did find a runner down in these parts. Show him, Danny.”

Danforth reached into his jacket and pulled out what only could be described as plastic skin that looked form-fitted for a child. He held it out on display for me, outstretched at the arms. Its shining, bald head warbled for a moment before folding forward. He flicked his wrists and it tottered over the other way. Other than its sheen, the skin could pass for that of a real child’s, save for there were no ears, and the nose, although its shape was in place, had its nostrils sealed over. The sockets where the eyes were supposed to be were instead lidded with translucent, little hollow bulbs. The only true opening on the head was at its mouth. Although no real, living child was inside, a very real sorrow lived on its face. It was the face of despair. It was the face of the hopeless.

“See, Dan here is a bit of an artist when it comes to putting skinnies on. He doesn’t even need a popper. Ye a bit bigger than we expected, but I’ve saw him once fit a girl near seventeen or so hands high. And a plump one too, she was. I’m sure we can get ye to squeeze in. Ye know? It’s funny, we brought one in close to ye age just today and he’s due for a--”

I wailed, tripped over my own feet, and fell back to the wet stone. I scrambled back down the walkway away from them, back toward the dead end. It was nothing but the flailing of terror.

The water was the only place I could go. I knew I was as good as caught if I went in there. The two – things, were silent now. The rings of stilled fire in their eyes glinted at me, cold now and with predatory calculation. They were going to move in for the grab.

I knew I had to act now.

Think Angelo. Think Goddamnit –

The coin I had put in my pocket with the insignia of the double image of the splayed man and the tree, that both Billy and that card had told me to hold on to, suddenly felt heavy in my pocket.

“It will be your light in the dark…”

I clasped it through my shirt. It sang to me in a way I can’t quite explain, almost like the sweet ring of a tuning fork.

An idea.

The lantern the one that calls himself Burcher is holding. It looks like it’s an oil lamp of some kind.

Breaking it and burning them with it was a stupid thought. It was also probably going to get me nowhere, but it was the only thought I had.

And the coin had reassured me.

Burcher, who was now just within reach of my ankles, slipped suddenly on the wet slush that had formed from the disintegrated ladder and the water that had been beneath it. He toppled, and I lashed out like mad and grabbed the lantern, yanking it from his hand with two, hard jerks. I swung it down on him in a long, plummeting arc with all the force I could conjure.

The lantern exploded on his shoulder. Swaths of gluggish oil blanketed him, and an eager and hungry flame chased it, unfurling and growing ravenously until the creature was in a blaze. Inhuman roars of anguish rung the walls of the shafts as he writhed. Danforth reached out to pull him toward the edge of the water but must have gotten some of the oil on his arm. As he grabbed for the burning Burcher, the hungry flame reached out and crawled up his sleeve, and set the brim of his hat alight.

He howled a tighter, but equally monstrous roar and flung the hat off. Suckling and attached to the top of his head was something in between a lamprey and a tadpole. Its tail coiled around his crown. He’d dropped the skinny he had been holding on display for me to shield the thing as he dove into the water.

I ran past them as fast as my legs would take me, cutting tight and hard down the shaft they came from. I didn’t know if it was the right move, but it didn’t matter. I was running and they were burning – at least for now.

A second, larger splash echoed behind me. I kept running. shaft after shaft, turn after random turn – I ran, hoping I didn’t come to a dead end.

Thankfully, I never did. The place seemed to be some sort of grid of winding canals and connecting corridors, but the water always seemed to flow in the same general direction.

Having felt I had lost them for a moment, I slowed down to think and catch my breath.

It all just felt too real. My lungs burned; my legs burned; I felt my soiled skin from three days without a wash. As fucked-up crazy as everything was, I was beginning to have a hard time buying my theory that this was the swan song of a junkie’s brain or a really fucked up bad dream.

I wasn’t craving a fix at all, which puzzled me, but everything else in the sensory department seemed to be working just fine; seemed to have shown up for work.

Although endless questions still swam around in my head, I still needed to find a way out. Making sense of it all would have to come later.

I eventually made out the faint light of an opening at the end of a canal I had been following for some time, careful to zig-zag into an adjacent corridor and then snake my way back across again in the hopes it would keep those fucking monstrosities off my trail.

The static hiss of cascading water grew louder as I kept moving.

A spillway

As I drew nearer to its opening, I noticed there were no more adjoined corridors or shafts I could use to could hide if I heard the two things that were hunting me.

If I were at the precipice and those things happened to spot me and close in, I would have no choice but to go down into wherever it led. Either that or receive an appointment for a fitting with that “skinny.”

And I had hurt them, hurt them badly by the sound of it. If they were that nasty before…

The way they were talking earlier implied there were more of them. Many more. I knew I was fucked anyway if I wandered the grid for too long in this ungodly canal system

I decided I was going to go for it, and if there was any sort of path down, I was going to jump. If it looked like it was going to be an abrupt end to my squandered life, well, I’d never much liked myself, to begin with. It’s been a hard and lonely journey and I have nobody to blame for it but myself. Besides, ending things on my own terms was going to be better than whatever they had planned for me.

Unless there really is no death in Undehael, as Danforth had said.
