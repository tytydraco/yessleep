Sprinkles of rain pelted me as I raced down the river road. I wheezed, trying to keep up with Claire. Every breath tasted like dust kicked up by her red Schwinn, even after she vanished around the curve up ahead. My chest tightened. I thought of my mom constantly nagging me to always carry my inhaler, even though it’d been years since my last asthma attack.  Around the bend, Claire swerved from one side of River Road to the other, not pedaling. Her bike's sprocket sang mechanically, “I’m waiting for you.” 

“Hurry up,” she shouted.

 I left behind my own cloud of dust as I sped up. Gravel crunched under my tires. Leaning over the handlebars, I balanced on the balls of my feet as I pedaled. I closed the gap between us enough to read the green and white button on her backpack as she tightened the straps. “Dam your own damn river,” it said. Small and ineffectual as it was, it was about as much as either of us could do to stop the hydroelectric dam from coming to our county. Claire glanced over her shoulder, her thin lips curling into a satisfied smirk before she raced ahead. 

 

Every school has at least one kid like Claire. Her clothes were all hand-me-downs, worn from the time she was big enough they wouldn’t slip off until they were either too tattered with holes to wear or she couldn’t fit them anymore. If I’d known the word “malnourished" when I met Claire, I might have understood why this rarely happened. Every day at lunch, she ate the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches the school made for kids who forgot to pack a meal. She also wore glasses, the cheapest kind the eye doctor sells, the thin black wire frames making the lenses look even thicker than they are. I think the saddest thing was the fact her parents didn’t bother making sure she was clean when she went to school. If you passed Claire in the hallway, or sat beside her in class like I did, you could smell the miasma she carried around with her.

I never paid much attention to Claire until the winter of fourth grade. In Henderson County, our winters are usually mild. A coat or thick jacket usually made recess bearable, but that year, a polar vortex caused temperatures to plummet. It was so cold, the thermometer outside our classroom window pointed to the empty space under negative 15. So cold, the teachers kept us inside during recess. Instead of playing tag or climbing on the jungle gym, our teacher pulled out board games that looked and smelled like they’d been mothballed since the Carter administration. This didn’t matter to me, the asthmatic kid who struggled with running, but for about two months, the rest of the class complained. Some of them cobbled together decks of mismatched Uno cards. Others tried putting together incomplete jigsaw puzzles. The last group activity was playing with a dusty set of Lincoln Logs. If you wanted to do something by yourself, the only options were reading or drawing quietly. 

There were never enough Lincoln Logs to go around, and despite our teacher’s best efforts, the classroom was too noisy to read, so I spent that winter drawing. I looked forward to recess, not just for the break in schoolwork, but also because Claire would leave the desk we shared, and I’d have fifteen or twenty minutes of much improved air quality. I never made ugly comments about how she smelled, but I had to admit, it was unpleasant. 

If I paid more attention to Claire after she left, I might have realized these breaks were to be short-lived. After the first week of indoor recess, the other kids didn’t want to play card games with her or lend her any of the limited supply of Lincoln Logs. 

One day, instead of finding a group to reluctantly let her sit with them, she wandered around the classroom, stopping here or there, waiting for an invitation to join in. None of them ever asked. They just ignored her until she left. This went on until she made a full circuit of the room. Defeated, she came back to our desk and sat in her chair.

I saw her staring at me from the corner of my eye, but tried ignoring her like everyone else. It felt like minutes passed as we sat there in awkward silence. I was shading in the shadows under a car when her timid voice interrupted me. 

“I like your drawing.”

“Thanks, Claire,” I said, not looking up.

“Is it a Mustang?”

Her voice trembled, and she let out a muffled sniff. I turned to face her. My frustration, realizing I wasn’t getting a break from sitting next to Claire, died when I noticed the tears behind her thick glasses.

In that moment, I remembered my mom telling me about the time she volunteered to help with the elementary school’s lice check. The staff knew a few of the kids had them, but for the sake of appearances, everyone was sent to the nurse’s office. She said the worst part wasn’t combing through hair infested with parasites; it was overhearing the kids waiting in the hallway make fun of anyone who left the room with a bottle of special shampoo. 

“I hope you’d never do anything like that,” she said. Looking at Claire, I realized she might have been one of those kids. I felt ashamed for ignoring her and decided to be friendly.

 

“It’s a Camaro. An IROC-Z.”

She sniffled as she wiped away tears with an oversized sweater sleeve. “I think my uncle used to have one of those.”

“That’s cool,” I said, forcing a smile. 

She stood there with a sad smile, not saying anything. 

“Do you want to draw with me?”

I’ll never forget how her eyes lit up, or how excited she was to find a blank page in her notebook. The rest of that winter, Claire spent recess with me. She was good at drawing, even if she mostly just made pictures of houses, usually two-storey ones, complete with turrets, spires, and wraparound porches. After a few days of talking to her, I found out she was a lot like the other kids I knew. Her parents might have had trouble holding down jobs and keeping the water on, but they always had cable. She liked the same popular TV shows as the rest of us.

What surprised me most was how much we had in common. We both read the Goosebumps books, watched reruns of Unsolved Mysteries, and even shared an interest in history. It was the first time I’d been able to mention this and not worry about someone calling me a geek. Before long, I found myself looking forward to recess with Claire. After indoor recess ended that spring, we still spent that time talking and drawing on the playground.

 

The scattered sprinkles turned into a misty drizzle as I tailed Claire down the tree-lined road. Our tires hummed over the old truss bridge’s grated floor. The river trickled below, clear enough you could see its muddy bottom, speckled with various discarded junk: a bicycle, a busted TV, even an old battery charger, to name a few. On the other side, we shot past a sulfur yellow sign from the 50s, riddled with bullet holes, but still legible. 

“No Swimming. Danger of Whirlpools.”

Old timers at the hardware store talked about people who didn’t realize these whirlpools weren’t like the ones in a bathtub. There was often nothing on the surface to indicate the submerged vortex, ready to drown anyone caught in it until they’d already been pulled under.

We pedaled another quarter mile or so, and Claire skidded to a stop next to the crooked oak tree, her brakes stirring up fresh dust. I coasted to a stop next to her, panting and wondering if I needed my inhaler, but Claire was already off her bike.

“Ahem,” she said, extending her backpack to me in one hand. I barely had one strap over my shoulder before she scrambled down the tree’s exposed roots to the riverbed. I hopped after her on one foot, pulling on my dad’s waders. I was surprised how fast she picked her way down the riverbank. All summer, she insisted I go first and help her down. I felt a strange aversion to this almost as strong as my fear of grabbing a snake lurking within the tangled mass of tree roots. I never felt a snake slither through my fingers, but I did feel knots in my stomach every time Claire lowered herself into my waiting arms, and in the split second she lingered in front of me when I set her down, and when she took my hand on the climb up to the road. I got that feeling just thinking about her sometimes, even if she wasn’t around. 

Low rumbles echoed through the river valley.  I chased Claire across the massive granite slab, worn flat from centuries of flowing water. The unassuming rock spends half of the year underwater, but when the river is low, it’s a local favorite for picnics and fishing. If you’re not careful, you might trip over one of the numerous square holes hollowed out at careful intervals between the river and its Eastern bank. Once used to support pilings for a grist mill, they provide the only archaeological evidence of Henderson County’s earliest settlement. Claire splashed across the shallow river, strangled by drought to little more than an ankle-deep trickle. Mud covered her ankles and bare feet when she reached the sunken boat we spent most of that summer excavating. We found it while researching our final project in 8th-grade history.

Mr. Stanford’s history final was a presentation about local history. The material wasn’t covered in the state’s official curriculum. It was more of a test of our abilities to apply the research techniques to the real world. The final was worth enough points to drop your report card a full letter grade, just to keep everyone engaged. This didn’t worry Claire or me. Since fifth grade, we had a running competition to see who could get the highest grade in history. We studied obsessively for every test, took copious notes, and even did the extra credit assignments. Before the final, we were tied at 108 percent. And since we worked together on all our group projects, the ongoing stalemate seemed likely to last indefinitely. Our partnership became the butt of several jokes. Even Mr. Stanford seemed to be in on it as he peered over his clipboard the last week of class.

 “I want you and Claire to give us a presentation about the mill that used to be near the river during the pioneer days.” His thick moustache twitched as he spoke. “There aren’t very many sources about this one, but find out as much as you can about what went on there.”

 Claire turned in her desk to face me. Gone were the days of assigned seats from grade school, but we still sat with each other in all the classes we shared. Her grey eyes brimmed with excitement. It was the same look she got after we both finished reading the same book, she was kicking my ass in Battlefront II or when we talked about our favorite music. 

I couldn’t help noticing the clique of popular girls in the back row and their half-muffled laughter. After being friends with Claire for so long, I sometimes forgot about the stigma she carried around with her. She still wore thick glasses, but took somewhat regular showers now. I’d been letting her sneak them at my house around the time she started coming home with me after school. Her clothes improved somewhat; basketball shorts or sweatpants replaced the pants that didn’t fit. The biggest difference was probably her height. She now stood almost as tall as me, but was still lanky from not getting enough to eat. Normally, I wouldn’t have cared what those girls thought, but it was hard to ignore their teasing eyes when I realized they weren’t just making fun of Claire; they were making fun of me too.

The state history books in our school library had precious little to say about our town, let alone the forgotten mill. The most we could find was a single paragraph in a moth-eaten book from the 1930s. It mentioned the grist mill in passing before going on in vague terms about the rapid and poorly understood decline of a nearby settlement. We were more intrigued by this later entry, but agreed it was something we would have to follow up on after the assignment.

“It’ll be a good summer project for us,” Claire said with a smile.

One paragraph in a book that didn’t even have an ISBN wasn’t enough to write a report, so we ended up riding our bikes to the county museum after school, hoping to find more information. The retired man working inside seemed eager to help. He had a habit of drifting the conversation, but after numerous course corrections, we were able to tease out more details about the mill. According to him and an even older local history book he showed us, the grist mill also milled lumber during the off-season. 

“They had stonemasons working in there too,” the man beamed. “They used to make whetstones, headstones, even building foundations from rocks quarried from the hills out there. A lot of them things ended up on flatboats launched from the ferry near Henderson’s tavern, bound for New Orleans.”

We thanked the man for his time and left. Even before visiting the museum, we planned on going to the site of the mill. Thanks to the old man’s long-winded history lesson, we were running short on time before it got dark. Even that last week of school, it hadn’t rained in almost a month, and the slabbed rock sat well above the water level.

Like most people in town, we’d been there before with our families on picnics, but this time we brought along a tape measure, digital camera, and a folding shovel. Working methodically, we measured the space between each of the holes. Plotting them in our notebook revealed the mill was massive. Our excitement grew with each hole added to our map. By the time we finished marking piling holes, the sun had almost sunk below the horizon, and the mill had become considerably more interesting. Claire even tried her hand at sketching what it might have looked like based on our research and a description from one of the books. Fireflies were coming out, and the streetlights would be on soon, but we decided to walk along the edge of the massive stone before leaving.

“Can you believe the size of that thing? It had to be the biggest building in the county.”

“Yeah,” Claire said, tilting her head to one side in thought. “There isn’t even anything this big in town now. Just think what it must have been like in pioneer days to see a factory in the middle of the forest, with nothing else around.”

“Wasn’t that tavern supposed to be around here too? The one with the ferry crossing?”

“Yeah, I think so. The guy at the museum said that the town from the school library book was nearby, too.”

“Carthage?”

“Yeah, something like that.” Claire scribbled the vanished town’s name in the margin of our map. 

We walked slowly. Claire was stalling, and I was too. She never wanted to go home and I didn’t blame her. One of the few times I met her at her doublewide, maybe because her parents hadn’t paid their phone bill, I saw her not-so-great home life firsthand.

“I’ll be right out,” she said. The crack in the doorway was just wide enough to poke her head through, but I still caught a glimpse of the mountain of trash behind her. It didn’t take her long to get ready, but I felt awkward waiting on the cluttered porch. One of those times, while waiting outside, I met her dad. Overweight, unshaven, and smelling like beer, he was working in a lean-to carport behind their home. A cigarette bobbed from the corner of his lip as he leaned under the hood of a truck that was more rust than paint. I said hello, and he trained his watery, bloodshot eyes on me. 

“So… You’re the one,” he said, nodding. 

“I’m Claire’s friend,” I said, introducing myself. “We sit together in some of our classes.”

He nodded, his face tightening into a grimace. “You’re the one she’s always goin’ to see. The one that’s got her talkin’ ‘bout history all the time.”

This was the first time I’d seen anyone drunk, and I didn’t like it. I wasn’t sure what to say.  I just stood there. My silence didn’t stop him from going on, slurring words as he went. 

“Got her talking about honors classes, readin’ books, goin’ to college, thinking she’s better than me and her Ma’.”

I was relieved when I heard the trailer’s screen door slap shut. I took a few steps back. “It was, nice, uhh... meeting you, sir,” I said before turning and joining Claire. 

“Did my dad say something to you?” She whispered before we took off on our bikes. 

“No, not really.”

Her dad’s hoarse voice shouted after us, something about Claire not staying out too late, as he shook a wrench in the air. I hated thinking of Claire in that place and wished she didn’t have to live with her parents.

 

“What do you think you would have been back in pioneer days?” I asked, grinning at the thought of Claire wearing an old-fashioned homespun dress. 

She considered for a moment. “Probably a school teacher.”

“Really?”

She shrugged. “That or a seamstress. It’s not like there were lots of options for women back then.”

I nodded. “Yeah, I guess not.”

“What about you?”

“Maybe a mill worker or carpenter?”

“Hmm.” Claire mused. “I was thinking you’d make a good blacksmith.”

I laughed. “What makes you say that?”

“You’re just really strong. Swinging a hammer all day, making things like in shop class? It seems like a good fit.” She looked away awkwardly as she said this. 

We walked a few moments in silence. I wasn’t sure how to respond to her compliment. Whether I wanted to admit it or not, something was changing between us. My other friends jokingly called Claire my girlfriend. My face turned red every time it happened. Most of that summer, I’d been struggling to find the right words to tell her how I felt. We had been friends for so long, I didn’t want to ruin anything. I’m ashamed to admit it, but the ugly comments people made about Claire made me hesitate. Some shallow part of me worried people would think less of me if I dated “the poor girl”.  

The silence ended when Claire pointed toward the river and shouted, “What is that?”

I followed her gesturing hand to a small mound of rocks and sand in the middle of the stream. 

“That’s just a sandbar.”

She shook her head. “No, on top of the sandbar. Under those rocks!”

Before I could say anything, Claire pulled off her shoes, stepped off the granite rock, and waded through the knee-deep water. 

“Are you crazy?” I shouted as I followed after her, almost losing my balance in the strong current. She ignored my words and toppled the rocks piled against what looked like the trunk of a tree. It wasn’t until I got closer that I realized it wasn’t a sunken tree; it was the hull of an overturned keelboat. I helped her pull away one stone after another, exposing the weathered, grey transom. We pulled away enough rocks to reveal the word “CONATUS” carved into the wood. We each tore a sheet of paper from the notebook and made rubbings of it, similar to the ones people make of headstones. We had everything we needed to finish our final project, but now we had an opportunity to do something we’d both dreamed of: uncover a missing piece of history. 

 

I’m not sure how long we were digging when the first lightning strike lit up the sky. Thunder shook the air around us, and the afterglow lit up our dim surroundings. I glanced up in awe and terror at the thunderhead overhead. I tried to put a finger on the muffled crackling sound that followed, but gave up quickly.  Claire tried hiding the fear behind her thick glasses as we locked eyes. She didn’t say anything. She turned and resumed digging. I shook my head, amazed at her stubbornness. 

“Claire?”

She didn’t answer, instead, she kept shoveling.

Glancing at the river, I realized our situation was worse than I thought. I’d ignored the scattered sprinkles earlier that morning. I hadn’t paid much attention to the light drizzle that replaced it. But gazing upstream, I saw the wall of advancing rain covering the river with ripples. Muddy water washed down the riverbanks. An odd crunching sound mingled with approaching rumbles of thunder.  A concrete culvert vomited grey water mixed with trash and roadkill into the river. Within seconds, the curtain of rain reached our sandbar, and heavy droplets beat down on us.  Most alarming was the fact that the channel between us and the safety of the granite slab had nearly doubled in width, and the strengthening torrent was eroding our small islet. Despite all this, Claire shoveled away.

I sighed reluctantly and folded my entrenching tool.

“Claire, we need to leave,” I said, stepping closer to her. She never once turned from what she was doing.

“We can’t stop now. Just five more minutes! I know we can-”

“In another five minutes, this will all be underwater.”  Drops of rain caught in the wind slapped my hand as I reached her shovel. The muffled crunch sounded somewhere nearby. I had no idea what it was and wrote it off as a distant lightning strike. 

She shook her head. “Not now. Can’t you see? We’re never going to have another chance-”

A streak of lightning struck the gnarled oak tree across the river we leaned our bikes against. The crackle of thunder mingled with the sound of splintering wood as the lightning strike cleaved a large branch from the tree.

“You see that! If we stay here, we’re gonna get hit by lightning or washed away!” I gestured to the widening stream, realizing for the first time it would be challenging to wade across.

Claire stood firm, but her eyes wavered. 

“Give me your shovel. I’ll put it in the pack.” 

I reached for it, but she jerked her arm behind her back. I stepped closer, grabbing at the olive green spade, almost coming chest to chest with her.

The whole time she kept muttering, “No… please… we’re never… going to have another chance like this.”

“Give me the damn thing!” I shouted at her. The words barely left my lips before I regretted them. Looking into those big, grey eyes, I felt the same remorse as if I’d just smacked her. 

Claire’s lip trembled, and something that wasn’t rain streamed down her cheeks. I struggled to say something, anything.

“We’ll come back in a couple months, or next year the river will be low.”

“We both know that’s not going to happen.” She shirked from my gaze.

I dropped my arm and tried a different approach. “Look, if we can’t dig it up, there’s gotta be another way. Maybe we can mount a camera underwater or ”  
  
“I’m not talking about the stupid boat!” Claire screamed, throwing her shovel into the dirt. I stepped back. She had never raised her voice at me. I think that’s why it stunned me more than her slender fists pounding weakly into my chest.

“I’m talking about us!” 

I looked at her, speechless. Present dangers forgotten as she buried her face in my chest and cried, “Are you really that dumb?”

My mind raced to find something coherent to say as I grabbed her small, round shoulders. “What are you talking about, Claire?”

She looked up at me, tears flooding her timid grey eyes. “Do you really think it’s going to be like this next year in high school? Us hanging out together?”

I must have hesitated, because she broke into tears.

“Why wouldn’t it be?”

She turned away from me.

“Claire, what the hell is going on?”

“You’ve been avoiding me all summer!” She glared at me through fresh tears. “How many times this month has it been *your* idea to come out here? Better yet, how many times this summer?”

I opened my mouth to deny this claim, but only silence came out. I couldn’t think of the last time I called and asked Claire to come over or see if she wanted to excavate the “Conatus.” Lately, she had just shown up at my house and knocked at the door. On a handful of occasions when I was sleeping in after a late shift at my part-time job, she had to let herself in with our spare key and wake me up. 

I tried not to look away, but failed.

“I know I’ve been busy lately, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to see you. You’re my friend.” My stomach tied itself in knots as I said this. Claire looked at me, the hurt still in her eyes.

“Do you think it’s going to get any better school starts next week? You’re starting honors history and English, and I’ll be stuck in the regular classes with everyone else. When are we going to see each other? In the hall between classes? At lunch? At…” She choked on her words and broke down into fresh, uncontrolled sobs.

I closed the space between us to try comforting her. As soon as I was within arm’s reach, she threw her arms around me. I hugged her back and held her a moment despite the worsening rain.

“I need to tell you something,” she sniffled.

“What is it?” I felt her peering into the depths of my soul as she fixed her beautiful eyes on me.

“It’s important,” she paused for a moment. “You’re my best friend, you know that, right?”

 My inner voice begged me to just tell her how I felt. Instead, I just nodded. “I know.”

She closed her eyes tight and took a deep breath. She trembled as she looked into my eyes before steadying herself and wrapping her warm lips around mine. The urge to disentangle myself from my awkward first kiss vanished almost as quickly as it came. Suddenly, nothing else mattered. Not storms, not school, not sunken boats or forgotten towns, least of all what anyone thought about us. I kissed her back. A lot was left unsaid as she pulled back and looked into my eyes, but I knew she shared the same feelings I had for her. I was going to tell her it would be alright. We could go back to my house and figure everything out. She was going to be my girlfriend, and we were going to make it work. Those big, grey eyes beamed at me with happiness I hadn’t seen since that day in fourth grade when I asked her to draw with me.

 

The muffled crunch was louder this time. I didn’t think much of it until Claire went stiff in my hands, and her eyes widened, fixated on something behind me. I looked over my shoulder at the broad, tall sycamore tree and immediately understood. Runoff from the cornfield washed clumps of dirt away from its roots, and the trunk crunched louder each time it bent under a fresh gust. 

“We gotta get out of here! That thing will crush us!”            

Claire grabbed her shovel and stuffed it in the soaked backpack. I glanced upstream at the churning brown water and hesitated to pick my first step. The tree overhead swayed, its limbs flogged at the water violently as the trunk leaned, prodding us along. Ankle-deep rivulets of muddy water ran across the sandbar. The longer we waited, the more dangerous picking a path through the water would be. 

My first step off the sandbar, water crept past my knee, threatening to top my waders. Clair followed. She stumbled over the uneven river bottom and almost fell into the cold, opaque water until I grabbed her. She trembled as I threw her arm over my shoulder and pulled her close to me. We had to lean against the current. Each careful step was a struggle as I searched blindly with the toe of my boot for a safe foothold. From the corner of my eye, I could see the tree thrashing violently in the storm. A deafening boom accompanied another lightning strike. I was too afraid to see how close it had been. Claire’s fingernails cut through my wet T-shirt into my skin. I tried to ignore a banded water snake slithering through our legs as we neared the slabbed rock. It took almost all my strength to keep us from being swept away as I probed around for the next step. I tried to ignore thoughts about the tree, lurking just behind us, exposed roots and ruined branches reaching out like claws, ready to drag us under the water. 

Claire muttered my name a few times. I ignored her. The next foothold on solid rock had to be close. From there, we could take a leap of faith, even swim a few feet if we landed short, and free ourselves from that damn river. Whatever she saw couldn’t wait any longer and she screamed my name. Her cries were drowned out by a cacophony of snapping roots and cracking limbs as the tree came crashing down toward us. I was almost too stunned to move as I watched the massive tree fall. I don’t remember how, but Claire and I ended up toppling over into the stream.

 We weren’t ready when the current pulled us under the murky water. I caught a glimpse of the patchwork of white and grey bark come down where we were just standing. Claire slipped from my grasp, and darkness enveloped me. For the briefest moment, another lightning strike illuminated my brown and black surroundings, just in time for me to see the backpack I had shrugged from my shoulders sink from my sight, carrying away all the proof of our excavations. 

The riverbed was deeper than where we crossed that morning, its muddy silt held the remains of waterlogged trees, branches, and roots snapped off at jagged angles, each like a crooked headstone in a murky graveyard. Thoughts of joining them raced through my mind when I felt cold water seeping through the buckled tops of my waders, weighing me down and dragging me deeper. 

My lungs burned. I told myself it was because I hadn’t taken a full breath before diving away from the tree, not a mounting asthma attack. Clawing at the buckles, one came undone easily enough. I pushed the rubber anchor down my pant leg. Cold water soaked my jeans as the waterproof boot vanished in the stream. I kicked as hard as I could toward the surface and choked on windswept waves, still struggling to undo the other boot. Even over the howling wind, I heard Claire screaming my name. I tried turning toward her voice to find her, but could barely keep above the surface with the wader clamped onto my leg. I needed both hands to get it off. Claire was never a strong swimmer. She needed me. Mustering what bravery I could, I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. 

Cold water passed over my face as I sank once more toward the bottom. The steel buckle cut my hands as I tried inching the rubber strap through it. Something slimy, yet stiff, brushed my shoulder. “Probably a fish or another waterlogged tree,” I thought.  My hands panicked over the cheap buckle, and I cursed myself for overtightening it. Something in the darkness nudged against my leg. Bubbles escaped my mouth as I cried out in muffled terror. I clawed at the buckle. A couple of my fingernails bent the wrong way in my desperate attempt to free myself. Just as the buckle began to loosen, my foot was caught in what felt like the forked branches of a sunken tree. I thrashed against its tightening grip, each movement slowed by the water. The current pulled my ankle deeper into the narrowing crevasse. Even in the darkness, white fog clouded my vision as I resisted the burning urge to take a breath. I fought to stay calm. I denied the possibility that the tightening in my lungs was the onset of a full-fledged asthma attack. As consciousness began slipping away from me, an odd calmness washed over me. With slow, deliberate movements I realized might be my last, I stretched the top of the boot open as wide as I could. Cold water rushed inside, and its grip on my leg slackened.  Using the snag on the river bottom as a boot jack, I pulled my socked foot free. My lungs were on fire. I struggled to keep my lips sealed while swimming upward. 

River water flavored my first breath with hints of dirt and decayed fish, but I inhaled greedily, coughing after each gasp. I wiped the wet hair from my face and looked around. Claire shouted my name, but her voice sounded far away. I spun in wild circles searching for her. 

“Claire!” I shouted at the top of my lungs, but the storm drowned out my cries. A frantic scan of my surroundings showed no trace of her. There was also no sign of the granite slab. We were approaching the washboard section of the river. I knew there was no way we passed the steel bridge leading to town, or the “falls”. They were all of three feet high, but our town was named after them.

Lightning lit up the river valley, illuminating drops of rain the size of nickels, trees along the riverbanks bowing to the wind like sheaves of wheat, the neglected truss bridge’s chalky red paint coming into view, and a bobbing head of soaked black hair. 

She shouted my name and I hurried after her, swimming with the current. Waves lapped up by the wind blocked my view. Each time they dropped or I crested one, I reoriented myself and beat the water with deliberate, hard kicks. Nearing the spot where she was struggling to keep afloat, I saw that her glasses were missing. 

“Claire! Stay where you are! I’m coming!”

“Where are you?” Her voice came to me in a whimper. “I can’t see you and I’m scared.”

I opened my mouth to say something, but the waves left me gagging on filthy water. I crested one swell after another. My lungs struggled for air. I felt so cold in the water, but none of it mattered. I kept paddling toward the last place I saw Claire. I was overjoyed when I found her treading water in a small circle, arms outstretched, searching for me. 

My relief catching up to her vanished when I realized she wasn’t swimming in circles of her own free will. She was trapped in the widening maw of a water vortex. I felt nauseous seeing the warnings of the sulfur yellow unfolding before me. Ignoring every instinct of self-preservation, I swam toward the thin, trying all the while to remember if the Boy Scouts ever taught me how to escape a whirlpool. This knowledge was forgotten if I ever learned it in the first place.

The current pulled me and everything else floating on the surface downstream, except the whirlpool and the things trapped in it. They stayed more or less in one place. Paddling headfirst toward the watery spiral, I knew I only had one chance to grab Claire before it was too late, and I was carried away by a current too strong to fight. 

I was nearly abreast of the whirlpool when I screamed for Claire to take my hand. I saw the terror in her eyes as she sank deeper into the murky brown vortex. 

“Grab my hand!”

I thrust a hand over the edge, into the deepening chasm of air. 

Claire wrapped her cold, slender fingers around my hand.

I gripped her hand and tried with all my might to haul her over the edge of the whirlpool, but I was caught in the current. My soaked clothes dragged against the churning water, tugging me downstream while Claire and the vortex anchored me to that spot. 

I kicked and paddled to no avail. The whirlpool sucked Claire deeper into it’s depths dragging me with her. I took a breath before I was pulled once more beneath the opaque waves. 

I thrashed against the water, kicked wildly, did anything I could think of. It was all useless, but I couldn’t give up. I was going to get us both out of this, even if it meant filling my lungs with water. There had to be a way out of this. I just had to think. There had to be something I could do.

That’s when I felt Claire loosen her grip. An instant before her fingers slipped through mine, I realized what she was doing. I screamed for her to stop but it was useless. The current ripped me from the spot. The muted rumble of thunder sounded overhead as a lightning strike illuminated the murky water. A sepia silhouette was the last I saw of Claire before she was swallowed by the river.

 

 I didn’t know they made coffins out of cardboard. Waiting in line to pay my respects, I wondered how long the coroner spent trying to get the serene expression on her face, one she never wore in life. A surprising number of our classmates were there under the guise of paying their respects, but I suspected some were just there to gawk. I felt eyes on me as they stole glances. Some whispered. 

When it was my turn at the coffin, I looked down at Claire’s pale body propped up on those lacey white pillows. My vision blurred with tears I couldn’t let myself shed. Claire’s mom glared at me. I’d never met her before, but her hateful eyes never left me as I said goodbye to my best friend. Walking away, my head drooped, I heard Claire’s dad whispering something about me loudly. I was glad I was too far to hear much of what he was saying. Even with the wide berth I gave him, I smelled the beer on his breath. 

I didn’t watch them bury her. I just couldn’t. As soon as my parents parked our car at home, I ran to my bike and rode off. Claire would have loved riding her bike on a day like that, even if it was overcast. I felt staring eyes on me once again as I pedaled through town. Whether anyone was actually paying attention to me as I wound through the familiar streets, I can’t say.  I just knew I didn’t want to be around anyone. I raced along, thinking for a bittersweet moment I might turn my head and see Claire on her bike, about to overtake me, but I knew it wouldn’t happen. My town flickered by in a blur as I lost control of the hot tears pouring from my eyes. I wasn’t having an asthma attack, but I couldn’t breathe as I sped down the river road.
