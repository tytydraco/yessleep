This all started a few weeks ago with a phone call from one of my close friends, Adeline. Now, I wouldn’t say me and Adeline are *close* close friends, but I’m there whenever she needs me and she’s there whenever I need her. 

Adeline always had a sort of, strangeness around her. Even in high school she seemed to have some sort of weird aura. Not the kind you would back away from or the one that gives you goose bumps or the shivers, it was just, weird. I’m not sure how else to put it if I’m being honest.

But that phone call, and everything that happened after it. It all just sort of, clicked into place you know? Like all the puzzle pieces suddenly made sense and you could finally finish it. Or like a problem-solving question on a test, you keep rereading the lines over and over and then you finally get it. It was like that after that phone call. Adeline just started to, make sense. 

Here’s how it happened;

------------


It was just a usual Wednesday. I got off of collage, and was doing some last-minute homework. I think it was around, 2pm? Maybe 3. Whatever, it was late afternoon and I got a call notification.

*”Adeline?”* I thought, *I wonder what she could want.”* So, I pick up.

“Hey Adi, what’s up- “

“Listen here Soph, I don’t have much time but do you remember my address?”

“Your address? Like your dorm address or? - “

“No! My house address! As in, the place I lived *before* collage. God Sophie why would you ask- you know what forget it this is too important.”

“What’s too important? Why’d you call me at this time by the way, I thought you had classes left still?”

“Just forget the classes! They aren’t important right now. Just, do you remember my house address?”

“Yeah, I mean, how could I forget? We had such fun sleepovers there.”

“Okay good you remember.” Now do you remember where my old room still is?”

“Bottom floor, in front of the stairs. Is this like a trivia game you’re trying to play with me? *How much do you remember of Adi’s childhood home? Winner gets one million dollars!” 

“This isn’t a laughing matter, Sophie! Okay look, outside my front door there’s a canister of gasoline, and some matches. Don’t worry the door’s unlocked- “

“Why is there gasoline and matched in front of your house Adi? Where would you even get that stuff?”

“That isn’t important right now! Look just, listen to me okay. The front door is unlocked. I want you to take the gasoline and matches, go to my room and *burn* it.”

“What? - “

“Don’t ask questions Sophie! Just do what I’m asking. Take the gasoline and matches to my room, and *burn*, it. Burn it all. Make sure nothing and I mean *nothing* is left.”

“But Adi, that’s your *childhood* room. I can’t just burn it! What about all the memories- “

“I DON’T CARE ABOUT THE MEMORIES! Look- just burn it okay? Burn it all I’ll explain later.”

“I’d rather you explain to me *now* before I go fucking burn up your room Adi.”

“Okay fine. I’ve, I’ve fucked up Soph. There’s, *something* in my room and the only way to get rid of it is to burn all of my belongings. If you’re worried about burning the rest of the house down don’t. The rest of my house will be fine as long as you shut the door after you lit the match. Look that’s all I can tell you for now so just, *please* Soph do this for me.”

“Wait, Adi what’s- “

“*Burn, it all, and leave nothing left. *” 

... 


So, being to good friend I am, I left my homework, got in my car and drove to Adeline’s house. The whole way there I was just repeating in my head that this was all probably just a prank. Adi loved a good prank so this was probably just another one of her jokes. But then why did she sound so serious over the phone? I wished I was right.

As I pulled up in Adi’s driveway, I could see the front door. And there it was, the gasoline and matches. But with what looked to be a small note attached.

I walked up to the front door, and picked up the small yellow post-it.

**Burn it all**. 

For fuck’s sake Adi, I kind of got that over the phone. 

With nothing else to do, I picked up the gasoline and matches and walked through the open front door. I was expecting for Adi or some of her family to pop out line *”Ha-ha! Pranked you!”* but no, the house was silent actually. A bit too silent, if I’m being honest. At this point I’m getting a bit scared. What is in Adi’s room? *If* there’s anything in her room. I ventured further into the house.

I stood outside Adeline’s door. The outside still painted the bright pink I remember. Some of it was peeling off at the edges. The butterfly and heart stickers still stuck to the corners and middle of the door. And the doorknob was still that obnoxious gold colour. Just as I remembered. 

I opened the door, gasoline in hand. Everything looked the same. Princess toys stacked in the corner, even brighter pink walls with that same obnoxious gold colour highlighting them. What seemed like hundreds of dolls and teddies on the bed. In a strange way, it felt like I was in my second home again. All the nostalgia hit me at once. I couldn’t burn this. This was *home*, mine and Adi’s home. Our childhood lived and breathed in this very room. 

I was about to leave, completely abandoning the idea of burning this place when I heard it. A quiet sobbing coming from beside the bed. I walked over, being as quiet as I could. And I saw *it*, the thing Adeline was talking about. 

It was hunched over itself. It’s over-sized head in its even bigger hands. Each one only had two fingers and were incredibly long. Deer-like legs folded upwards in an unnatural position, with what looked to be some sort of misshapen humans’ feet attached. I could see each of its bones, count every individual curved spine plate. It seemed to go on for forever. And then it’s chest. It wasn’t hollow like I expected, but instead held a purple mass. The mass had a mouth with too many teeth and wide-open eyes that were staring directly at me.

The thing then let out a huge shriek that shook the house and bolted up right. It had to bend its neck awkwardly to fit under the low ceiling and I could see its second face. The face of pure horror.

I quickly opened the gasoline and tipped it onto the floor while rushing out the room. It tried to follow me but it couldn’t get far, slipping in the gasoline. I lit a match, a few matches, all the matches in the box and threw them all into the room and shut the door. I could hear it screaming all the way back to my dorm room. 

I sometimes still can, I’ll randomly wake up to it shrieking in my ear. It’s pained face is stuck in my mind. I think it will be forever.

I haven’t heard from Adeline after that. I’ve tried messaging, calling, going to her dorm. Even asking her roommate but she hasn’t seen Adi either. It’s like she just, disappeared. That was until yesterday.

Police finally found Adi’s body. Burnt to a crisp in her childhood bedroom. Her face forever locked in a painful expression. They say I did it. That I killed her.

But I didn’t, I *swear* I didn’t. It wasn’t me. She, she must have put herself there. Yeah. Yeah, she killed herself, *I* didn’t do anything to her. I was only doing what I was asked. *I didn’t do anything!* You can’t just *blame* me! Sure, I was there last. And- and sure the CCTV shown I dragged Adi’s unconscious body into her room and, and pulled the gasoline and matches out of my car then left. That doesn’t mean *I* did it! 

I swear I didn’t! I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING!
