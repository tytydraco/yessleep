She would not stop screaming as if she saw a supernatural creature, it makes me not want to be with her anymore. I wonder why she is often with my brother, she does not love me anymore. Nevertheless, everyone appears to be all right with me in view to the fact that they do not care about me. She is the only one that screams at the top of her lungs eternally whenever she sees me. 

I wonder what is wrong with her, or is it me that has something wrong? She would always shout “Leave me alone, I am so sorry”. Confusion takes over me. What does she mean by that? I always leave whenever she says that. She really did changed a lot after that time we had eaten dinner together. 

I remember eating red meat with her for the last time, we were happy and I don’t get why she changed after that. Well, I kind of sort of do not remember that much since I blacked out after eating our dinner, I was probably tired from work. I had woken up in the basement with full of blood after being unconscious for a short time. What the f*ck happened? She was probably pulling out a prank on me, it is not funny, it’s only ketchup, I did not feel anything. 


I went back to the kitchen only to see her with my brother kissing. I just stood there until she sees me and when she saw me, she started to scream like a siren. My brother comforted and hugged her immediately as she cried out loud. I get it, she is cheating on me but she doesn't have to break my eardrums just like that. My brother didn’t seem to notice me. I stared at her, I am hurt. She took glance at me once again, and there, she started screaming louder than the previous one but this time she was shouting “Leave me alone, I am so sorry” multiple times. My brother gave her a confused look but he still comforted her. I left the house, hurt, but I did not cried, she doesn't deserve any of my tears. I still don’t get the blood-like in the basement with me and her screaming like a child that I found out that she was cheating on me. 

I was greeted with silence outside. I saw my neighbour who just came home from work, I approached him but he didn’t even said a single word or even look at me. I was f*cking standing in front of him, how can he not see me. I just left and slept in the bench. The next day, there is a lot of people passing by me but neither of them noticed me. I went back to my ex-girlfriend’s house to talk about what happened, and when she saw me, she started screaming again. What did I do wrong, she's going crazy. I went near to her and I saw her eyes’ reflection. I saw a figure of me headlessly full of blood and stabbed in the heart.
