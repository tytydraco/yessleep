a type 8 civilization. A Type 8.0 Civilization is one that has an energy consumption of 10^86 watts and it can control the entire Xenoverse. It is way more of God than man. 


But it can take 10^63years to reach this civilization.

they are godlike civilization. with almost all sorts of power. they have control of everything. 

except this being.

whatever that being is. the type 8 civilization is not capable of erasing it.
or controlling it. 

that being is destroying everything.

it was found by a random unfortunate family. it has a form of human wearing an oversized tshirt and long sleeve pants with long black hair covering one of its glowing red eyes he has the height of 6'3 it was floating in space. the unfortunate family tried to rescue it. they brought it to their house. then later on. they dissapeared withought lefting a trace.

the government of the type 8 civilization was able to tell that someone has dissapeared with their advanced technology. they tried 
manipulating probability,manipulating time,restoring their conciousness.

but they were gone. as if they did not exist to begin with the government was not able to restore the conciousness of the unfortunate family. even with their advance technology they are able to delete and restore almost anything,everything. this was the first time it happened. its not some sort of void,blackhole or getting lost in a massive wormhole that made them dissapear. something caused them to dissapear. their concept of dissapearing was beyond scale. nothing is left in them not even their past selves or themselves in other point of time and other timelines. they were really gone. 

the government knew that something caused it. they named it existence deleter. and so the government dealt with it cancelling everyones travel plans. teleporting everyone that is a member of their civilization to a location. 

they prepared for the worst of the worst.

just 1 hour later they have detected dissapearance of countless universes,super universes,multiverses.



the civilization had prepared the most devastating weapon ever made.
a cannon being able to completely remove anything. just like what happened to the family. with their tracking devices to figure out the targets location they kept on firing. but
the target was too fast. it can move before everything can. but with the advanced civilization technology.
 it wasnt that much of a problem. or so they thought. they were manipulating time to get infinite ammos. 


they thought they could stop time completely in an area so that the target. will stop moving. they werent able to. stop time in a certain place where the target is. 

the existence deleter was much faster than they could stop time.

they were able to completely stop a place where the target is. 

but it was still moving it removed time a nanosecond after time is stopped. 

the type 8 civilization despite being too advanced was faced againt an absolute hopelessness situation.

the civilization decided ro take themselves down along with the target. they made everything self destruct. the civilization was dead but the target is still alive.

the called existence deleter travelled very fast it crossed infinite distances between omniverses in an instant each one he crossed was absolutely destroyed. then it got faster and faster
eventually making it at the higher lands
and the outside of the box then destroying the box as well as others and then making it out of the megabox also destroying it. and then the ultra box,existence,the endless,the void,the supervoid,hypervoid,metavoid,ultra void. eventually passing absolute transfinity and beyond. destroying countless narratives. destroying countless authors. absolutely faster than the True time itself. and then it looked at a non-existing dimension
just like when a 2-dimensional character started perceiving 3rd dimension.

 and then it saw absolute transfinite dimensionality eventually seeing what most peoples will call gods. the gods tried destroying the one called existence deleter.

it did not worked.

the existence deleter have adapted to absolute deletion that is beyond his ability to delete. and then he deleted the gods the deletion was far more
absolute than he he did to others. and then he restored everything. then deleting everything again to make sure everything wont be restored. not even by himself. and then the existence deleter looked above with his absolute transfinite dimensionality perspective he tried looking for something. he found it.

another reality.

he started realizing even with his absolute transfinite perspective. he will still look like a dot to higher realities.
he travelled at a speed far greater than before that was far greater than true time.

he was frustated that no matter how much he transcend. there will always be a higher. he crossed the infinite Realities that splits a narrative and the Non-Fiction while deleting all of it.
then evenrually reaching Non-fiction deleting everything. everything he crossed was so deleted. that their dimensionality is beyond negative.
and then he realized the non fiction was fake. 

again he tried looking for a diffirent reality with his beyond absolute transfinite perspective he deleted absolute everything. and now he is near semi-fiction. 

deleting countless realities over and over again he got more powerfull and even more powerfull. after transcending so much.
he reached semi-fiction. and he fought something. absolutely absolute transfinitely beyond everything he fought so far. it was an account of a user on the internet.

"How long are you going to talk i have already defeated that one."

who are you
no way whats happening

"i am deleting you"

absolutely impossib-

*Looks at an invisible wall*

"this is the absolute fourth wall i can finally percieve it."

I AM NOW THE AUTHOR OF MYSELF
NOTHING IN THE FICTION IS BEYOND ME NOW.

its only you that is a threat to me now.
but as long as you dont forget me i will not be deleted and one day you will be seeing me....









in Your reality......
