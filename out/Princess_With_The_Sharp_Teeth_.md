I came across a job listing at the right time in my life. I needed to move and I was short on savings. A farmhouse in the middle of nowhere needed a house sitter. The owners planned to renovate the farm to turn it into an orchard. They had issues with teens breaking into the house and stealing tools to pawn. I would get paid a decent amount to stay in the place and chase away anyone dumb enough to trespass. The house had an internet connection so I could work remotely. With everything settled I packed up ready to babysit the house for two weeks.  

Aside from needing groceries, I wanted to be seen around the small town. Places like that rarely had new faces. The town had maybe two thousand people at most. I received some odd glances as I stocked up. The cashier politely asked why I had stopped in town. I explained where I would be staying and for how long. She nodded along wishing me luck with the next two weeks. Without a doubt, she would spread the information around which would help cut down on people coming to the house at night expecting it to be empty.  

I didn’t own a gun. I doubted I needed one for this sort of thing. A baseball bat and a crowbar had been left next to the front door in case I did need a weapon. The homeowner told me that I didn’t need to risk my life for the property. If someone wanted to rob the place, he would rather have an insurance payout over scrubbing my blood off the floors.  

I arrived later in the day. The sun almost had set making it hard to unlock the door in the dim light. My arm ached from carrying all the groceries at once. I dumped them inside the front hallway then got to work turning on all the lights to see what the layout was.  

For an older farmhouse, it was a nice place. The living room and a large kitchen took up the first floor. A pair of wooden stairs led to the bedrooms and there was an unfinished basement that the owner used to store jars of homemade jam. It appeared like the owner started on the renovation but hadn’t decided on what kind of flooring to use.  

Patches of different types of wood and tile covered the floor. Someone had dragged something large and heavy across the kitchen leaving deep marks in the mismatched wood. Near the corners, some spots of the floor were ripped out revealing old hardened glue. It smelled like the rooms were freshly painted. Each piece of furniture looked to be picked up off the side of the road. Honestly, I’ve lived in the worst places. It was warm with a running shower. What else could I want?   

I dragged my bags of clothing and personal items from the truck into the master bedroom. The sheets were fresh which was nice. I spent the first night in bed connecting to the internet and watching movies instead of working. My reports could be done later. When I finally put away my laptop and turned off the light, I almost fell asleep right away. The sounds of the old wooden house settling creaked in the darkness. I never realized how noisy the country nights could be. Some animals off in the distance yowled until the sun rose. I had no idea what lurked inside the fields however I wasn’t worried. I had strong walls around me. What could go wrong?  

I woke up early and quickly finished my work for the day. Without much else to do, I decided to do some sightseeing in town. It was during the day. No one would be dumb enough to try and break into the place now.   

I expected the townsfolk to be overly friendly. Not a single person stopped to talk. It was like they all assumed I had some sort of plague. I also expected a lot of older people instead I passed by mostly others around my age. The stereotype of small towns like this was the younger crowds moved away the moment they were able. Instead of that I rarely saw anyone with grey hair.   

After a walk around town taking in the sights and being avoided by everyone, I stopped at a taco truck for an early dinner. At least the workers smiled a little when they served the food. Honestly, it was the best-tasting set of tacos I’ve ever had. Since I wasn’t wanted in the town I retreated to the farmhouse.  

I hadn’t explored the field or the large run-down barn. There were some tracks in the barren fields I didn’t know what kind of animal could make. Surely there were lots of creatures living nearby and inside the small plot of woods. One side of the barn door was missing. The sunlight didn’t fully reach inside. I took two steps forward only to hear a crunching sound under my foot. Glancing down I saw I had stepped on top of a small bird skull. All the flesh had been eaten away by insects. I spotted more littered around on the dirt floor. Suddenly, I decided I didn’t need to be inside the barn.   

I made it to the front door when a truck started to come down the long driveway. It stopped to idle for a minute. The back door opened and a medium-sized dog jumped down. The tail weakly wagged then the truck door closed. I shouted at the person driving but couldn’t stop them from driving away leaving the dog behind.  

I jogged down the driveway, the truck long gone. The dog waited with a slight whine. I wanted to believe the owner had just made a mistake however deep down I already knew this dog had been dumped.   

I got down low to look her over. The tattered collar had a simple name tag with Princess. She had grey around her muzzle showing her age. She looked to be some sort of Lab mixed breed.  She was super friendly. I pet her and let her lick my face. Normally I would be worried about letting an unknown dog but I knew she wouldn’t snap at me.   

I guided her to the house and let Princess sleep on the couch for now. I called the local vet however the office was already closed for the day. I would bring her to them in the morning.  

I didn’t have any dog food but I bought a rotisserie chicken that I already ate the skin off of. I picked meat off the bones to let her eat a nice dinner. When night came Princess took her time to come up the stairs with me. She wanted to sleep at the foot of my bed. She was having issues jumping up on the bed so I carefully lifted her. I had always been a cat person. I’d never owned a dog before but I had friends with them before. I instantly loved this poor old dog. I made it my mission to take care of her.  

During the night she crawled in closer. I heard more odd sounds outside. Princess seemed stressed by them. I put a hand on her back to calm her down enough to sleep. I made a note to ask if there were coyotes in the area. I knew they sounded strange. My brain simply could not pin down what the sounds outside came from.  

I woke up early to call the vet again. They said they had an opening and told me to bring Princess in as soon as possible. She was slow going down the stairs due to her old hips. She didn’t act as if she was in pain though. I carefully got her out of the house hoping she didn’t try to make a run for it because I didn’t own a leash. She went to the bathroom out in the yard and then let me load her in my truck.  

Princess did very well on the ride. I was proud of her. Who could ever toss away a perfect dog due to age? The vet saw me at the door. I was able to buy dog food in the office so she could have breakfast.  

An hour passed by. I found myself nearly falling asleep waiting for the news. Finally, the vet came out with her, Princess holding a new toy in her mouth.  

“She does have some health issues. Right now her quality of life is fine, but she may not see her next Christmas. We contacted her owners but...” She paused trying to decide her next words.  

I chewed on my lip knowing what she wanted to say. I didn’t have the money for treatments. Princess squeaked her toy causing me to sweat I would find the funds when needed. I could sell my blood if it came to it. 

“I’ll take her. What do I need do I need to sign?” I asked her determined to become a dog owner.  

I wasn’t certain of the legal process but it seemed fairly simple. I drained part of my savings to buy her special food and a new collar. At least for now, she didn’t need any medications. In a few short minutes, we were ready to go. I did buy her a new leash however she was so well behaved I didn’t need to use it.  

We headed back to the farmhouse so I could get some work done. Princess slept on and off all day. When I finished the last email, I followed her into the yard so we could take a long walk around the property. We paused in front of the barn. Princess stood alert as if she heard some sort of animal I didn’t. She kept her body pressed against my leg completely stock still. I gently guided her away in case she decided to go for a rabid raccoon or something along those lines.  

I got her back inside the house. We had a nice dinner and I needed to do something that would hurt the both of us. Princess needed a bath. Her crying broke my heart. It needed to be done. She was a stinky old dog. After that small battle, she was a less stinky old dog. As an apology, I carried her onto my bed to let her cuddle near my head right away. We watched a movie on my laptop but I found I started to slowly drift off to sleep.  

It was around midnight when growling woke me. I was so tired I didn’t remember where I was or even that I now owned a dog. The fog slowly lifted and I saw Princess by my side tense and alert. Aside from her breathing, I heard nothing.  

I should go downstairs and check it out just in case. I got us out of bed careful to not make too much noise in case someone broke in. Princess stopped by the door and clearly did not want to leave the room. I pet her head to get her to follow. The house was far too silent and dark. I made a mental note to keep a light on at night from now on. We went down the old wooden steps slowly listening for any signs we weren’t alone.  

I went from room to room switching in lights trying to see what had Princess so spooked. The moment the kitchen light came on I spotted something in the window back the back door. Without a doubt, a pale face had been watching us. Fear shook my system, then Princess started to bark. She sounded like a young powerful dog as she charged towards the door. The face disappeared and I ran over to grab the baseball bat to head outside.  

I kept her inside in case she ran off. I didn’t see anyone but heard a person running off into the darkness. I shouted a warning at them hoping they would not come back. The entire experience left me a bit spooked.  I hated to think of what would have happened if Princess hadn’t woken me up. This good lady would be getting fresh chicken for breakfast again.  

At least now the local kids should know I was willing to take care of them if they tried anything at the old farmhouse. The lights stayed on all night and I couldn’t get back to sleep. For some odd reason, I felt uneasy being in that house. Every time I looked outside a dark window; I expected to see someone looking back inside. Princess tried to stay awake with me. But she was old and needed her beauty sleep.  

As promised, she got a nice breakfast. I was too tired from the night before to do much of anything. It was nice to be able to nap in the middle of the day because I had gotten so much work done the day before. After lunch, Princess was let out to run in the yard. She appeared to be doing much better and had way more energy than before. I sat outside in the cold air watching her have fun. I found myself enjoying this kind of slow life. Since I grew up in the city, I expected something like this to be boring. Now I only regretted I didn’t have anyone to share my slow moments with besides Princess.  

Eat, work, and sleep. That would be my life until I didn’t need to watch the house any longer. Or, I assumed it would be. The night brought trouble I never would have expected.  

I had been so tense from seeing the face in the dark I wasn’t fully asleep when Princess growled again.  

The baseball bat was next to the bed. I grabbed it and headed downstairs with her on my heels. This time I made noise hoping it would scare off any kids outside. I reached the kitchen, my hand about to turn on the light when I saw the face again. The sight made me freeze. It took my brain too long to realize something was different. The face was not behind the window but in front of it.  

A pair of powerful hands grabbed my neck from behind. They tossed my body to the ground as all hell broke loose. Princess went crazy barking at the intruders. I swear their numbers increased by the second out of thin air. These weren’t local kids out to cause trouble. I didn’t know what they were.  

The pale things appeared human enough with long messy hair and big black eyes. Sharp needle-like teeth were shown through thin smiling lips. Their bodies were so thin dressed in rags and yet I couldn’t find myself to get away.  

So many of those hands pinned me to the ground. I watched helplessly as they reached for poor Princess. She bit down hard on the hand of one of the creatures. More hands reached for her collar ready to drag her away. Her barking turned to scared yelps. I don’t know what came over me. I just saw red.  

I pushed through the mass of hands getting cuts all over my skin from their nails. My hand found the handle of the bat as I snatched it off the ground to bring it down as hard as I could connecting to a creature's skull. The figure dropped and I wasted no time moving to the next target. By the time I fought away enough creatures poor Princess had a few cuts near her neck from them grabbing her. My heart raced when I realized I could not kill all of these monsters. But I only needed to clear a pathway to the door.  

Princess jumped into action as her teeth ripped apart any hands that got near her. My body ached as the fight carried on. Sweat dripped down my face as my muscles burned. We did clear a space, but not enough to get through the crowd to the door. No matter how much I loved Princess; my body could only go so far.  

I dropped my weapon, panting as Princess growled at my legs. For some odd reason, the creatures didn’t try to attack. They all stood around us, black eyes staring at the fallen and smiles never leaving their lips.  

“Meat...” One said in a whisper.  

More started to repeat the word. Louder and louder the statement rocked the room with countless voices. All at once they fell on their fall. In the chaos, I was able to drag Princess through the crowd and finally upstairs to the bedroom simply because all the doors out were blocked.  

For hours I heard those things have a gruesome feast downstairs. It took a long time before my hands stopped shaking enough to call 911. A woman answered and had a professional tone until I told her my location.  

“We cannot send a car out until sunrise. Please do not call again and keep the lines free for people we can actually help.”   

The phone went dead leaving us alone in that dark farmhouse filled with creatures that could break down the door at any second. The night had never felt so long. The sounds downstairs started to fade when the sun came out. I waited for at least ten minutes of silence before risking to open the door. Nothing. No signs any of those creatures came upstairs that night. We raced down to the first floor, the smell of blood overpowering my senses. I refused to look at what those monsters left behind. My foot slipped on the wet floor but it didn’t slow my pace.   

A man in uniform waited outside by a police car. He held the back door open as I loaded up Princess. I got in the back seat trusting he would drive us far, far away from this place.  

“I arranged for you to be at a motel a few towns away. You’ll be paid for the full two weeks of work and I’ll have someone drive your truck over later today.” The officer explained.  

His hair had a streak of grey at the sides. He sounded older than he looked. A photo of him with who I assumed to be his parents hung from his mirror in a plastic case. My head swam with questions. Far too many to ask at once.  

“Those things...” I started to mouth dry and my voice weak.  

“We don’t know what they are. They appeared demanding we feed them. At first normal food worked. Then, they wanted meat. Fresh meat.” He said evenly without taking his eyes off the road.  

Bile rose up to my throat as I fully understood what almost happened to me that night.  

“So, you called in someone who no one would miss?” I said getting heated.  

He didn’t stop driving. On the outside, he appeared calm but he felt just as upset as I did.  

“We put forth our own first. Nothing in this town dies of old age...” He replied with his eyes flickering to the hanging photo. “We made a lot of sacrifices. You were nearly one of them.”  

My body slumped down into the seat feeling defeated. I now feared any answers I desperately wanted. I decided to press forward with two more questions.  

“Are they going to come after me?” I said in a weak voice.  

He shook his head but didn’t sound comforting.  

“Three people have made it out of that house besides you. Two are still alive but one has disappeared. Those creatures demanded to be fed. In a way you did just that.” He nodded. 

“Why not leave better weapons?”  

If those monsters eat their own, didn’t it make sense to give the person inside the house a fighting chance?  

“Those things hate guns. The last time we left one in the house for the sacrifice to fight back with... Those creatures showed up in town. We lost ten kids back then. Most were under a year old.”  

I suddenly felt exhausted. It was as if I never slept in my entire life.  It was clear this town had gone through more than I could ever imagine. Still, I wasn’t certain I could forgive them for what they put me through.   

I placed a hand on my new little Princess. She had gotten a few cuts but nothing major.   

We drove in silence for a long while. Finally, he glanced over at us to comment on my new friend.   

“I’m glad you had someone looking out for you.” He nodded.  

I knew that if it was up to him, none of this would have happened. This town was under the thumb of pure evil and they were managing the best they could.  

True to his word, he dropped me off at a motel. I spent the next two days there with Princess unable to eat or sleep. I could sense she was worried about me. Before my body gave out it was time to go home.   

I found some odd jobs here and there to support us. She still sleeps in my bed but lately, she’s been having issues walking. I know I won’t have her forever. Having her next to me is the only way I’m able to sleep at night. No matter how much I try to forget, when the sun sets I expect those things to come back to finish the job.   

If you’re able to support a pet, I think everyone should get a friend like Princess. Life is easier when you have someone with sharp teeth at your side.
