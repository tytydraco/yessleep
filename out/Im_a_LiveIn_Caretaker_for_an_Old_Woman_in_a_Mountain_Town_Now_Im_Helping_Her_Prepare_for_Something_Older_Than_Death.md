I was still furious with Mara. She was making breakfast in the kitchen again, and at that point I didn’t even care whether I was supposed to help her or not. If looks could kill, she would’ve dropped dead on the spot.


“Don’t look at me like that, David,” she growled, just as angry as I was. “It’s your fault I kept you here. What you let loose—that thing—is pure abomination.”


“That’s why I wanted to leave,” I snapped back.


“No one walks away from a mistake that big, David.” She didn’t even look at me. “You don’t run from responsibility.”


I muttered under my breath. The idea of leaving… it didn’t even cross my mind anymore. It was like the option had been erased from my brain entirely.

Mara ate in silence. I just drank coffee; after last night, I couldn’t force down a single bite. She looked pissed, but she didn’t show it—she just simmered quietly, like she always did.


“So how do we get that thing back?” I finally asked, guilt creeping into my voice.


“We don’t,” she muttered. “It was davo. It’s long gone by now.”


I had no idea what that kid—or whatever he was—actually had been. And how long he’d even been in that basement. I didn’t want to think about it.

The tense silence broke when the doorbell started blaring.


“I don’t know who that is,” Mara said with a shrug. “Go open it, son.”


I headed for the door. Another ring—then knocking. I swung it open.

A huge man in a black suit stood there. Sunglasses, stone-cold expression, built like a refrigerator.


“Is Mara here?” he asked, already trying to peer past me into the house.


“Uh… why? Who are you?”

“Move,” a deeper, older voice said from behind him.


The big guy stepped aside—and that’s when I saw them. The entire yard was filled with men in black suits. Three massive black cars were parked out front.

An older man stepped forward.


“Good morning,” he said, with a calm, polite smile. “My name is Dr. Gelon.”


Dr. Gelon carried himself like a man who’d spent his whole life being obeyed. His silver hair was neatly combed, his jaw dusted with a careful bit of stubble — the kind older gentlemen keep to look distinguished, not sloppy. When Mara offered him tea, he politely declined, saying he didn’t want her to trouble herself.
Then he sat down on the couch like he owned the place.
The giant guy stayed planted by the door.

I could see it on Mara’s face — she hated that these people were here. Hated them in a way I couldn’t yet understand. But something kept her from throwing them out. And from the way Gelon watched her, relaxed and almost amused, I knew he’d known her for a long time.


“We’re here, Mara,” he said, settling himself comfortably. “You’ve fulfilled your obligation. You remember our agreement?”


“I remember…” Mara muttered through clenched teeth. “What do you want now?”


Gelon smiled. It was a pleasant smile, but there was something coiled and smug behind it. He knew he had the upper hand.


“Mara,” he said calmly. “I’ve come for the control. We need it now.”


Mara licked her lips nervously. I stayed in the kitchen doorway, feeling like a kid listening to adults discuss things far above my pay grade.

She stalled, but Gelon was patient in a way that felt threatening — like he could sit there for days without moving until she complied.


“David,” Mara finally said, defeated. “Bring me my pipe from that drawer. And from the kitchen — a mason jar.”


I blinked. I didn’t even know she smoked, let alone… whatever this was.
But I did as she asked: handed her an old wooden pipe from the living room cabinet, and a large empty mason jar.

Mara set the jar in front of her and rolled the pipe in her hands, buying herself a few more precious seconds.


“Mara,” Gelon said softly — almost gently. “Give me what I came for. Or should I let your sister know exactly where you are?”


Mara’s eyes flashed with fury — a kind I’d never seen in her before. But she didn’t argue.

She struck a match, lit the pipe, and took deep, heavy pulls. Thick clouds of smoke poured from her mouth. Gelon watched with mild annoyance, like a man bored at a magic show.

Mara inhaled again — huge, long, and slow — then held the smoke in her lungs.
In one smooth movement, she grabbed the mason jar, pressed it to her lips, and exhaled everything into it.

The jar filled instantly with swirling gray smoke — and it didn’t behave like smoke.
It didn’t fade, didn’t thin.
It twisted. Darkened. Thickened. Like something alive.

Mara screwed the lid on tight.


“Here,” she snapped, shoving the jar toward Gelon. “Take it and go wherever the hell you want.”


Gelon smiled again — polite, victorious — and accepted the jar.
He handed it to one of the big suited men, who immediately stepped outside with it.


“Thank you for your service, Mara,” Gelon said with a little bow. “We will contact you again if we require your assistance.”


Mara responded by lifting her middle finger straight at his face.

Gelon burst out laughing — genuinely amused — and strolled out of Mara’s house like a man who’d just closed a profitable deal.


Mara disappeared into her room and locked the door behind her. She didn’t say a single word to me.

Not knowing what else to do, I washed the dishes, straightened up the house.
She stayed inside the entire day; when I asked if she wanted dinner, she just yelled at me to leave her alone.

So I didn’t push it.
I went grocery shopping, cleaned up the yard, cooked something simple.
The whole day felt strangely empty — like Mara wasn’t even in the house.

The next morning, I stumbled toward the kitchen half-asleep.

And then I saw her.

Mara was sitting in the living room, fully dressed, sitting upright in her wheelchair like she was about to leave for an appointment.
I froze where I stood.


“Mara? What are you doing?” I asked, still rubbing the sleep out of my eyes.


“David…” she cut in immediately. “Something has started in this world, and I must take my part in it. You help me, yes?”


That woke me up instantly.

Her face was darker than I’d ever seen it. Heavy. Determined.
Whatever had been happening before — with the boy, the basement, the box — this felt even deeper, even worse.


“What happened, Mara?” I asked anxiously.


“Come,” she said, gesturing for me to follow. She rolled toward the locked room. “Help me bring something out.”


She opened the door. And it felt like stepping into another world.

Shelves everywhere, stacked with crates, jars, dusty objects I couldn’t even name. A witch’s pantry — that’s the only way I can describe it.


“Here.” She pointed at a large wooden chest. “Take this, David.”


The chest was heavy — ridiculously heavy — and I barely managed to wrestle it out to the car. Mara followed, carrying a small bag of her own.


“Are we going far, Mara?” I asked as I lifted the chest into the trunk.


“Yes, David. Very far…”
She looked back at the house. “Lock the door. Take the keys. We not come back for long time.”


The drive felt endless. We left everything behind: towns, neighborhoods, gas stations — as if Mara could erase the world with a single thought.
The heavy wooden chest sat on the back seat, and every now and then Mara glanced back at it, like she was afraid it might disappear.

She barely spoke.
Just stared ahead, her wrists tense, the tendons standing out like she was bracing for something I couldn’t even begin to understand.

We eventually reached the outskirts of a large city, pulling up to a neat two-story house on a wide, carefully maintained lot — the kind of place people dream about owning.

Mara practically hurried out of the car, heading straight toward the front door.


“Hurry, David. Guard is waiting for us,” she said as she saw me still lifting the chest from the trunk.


I didn’t ask who Guard was. I knew she wouldn’t answer.

The short man really had been waiting. He opened the door the moment Mara rang the bell.
The look on his face… it was pure resignation, like someone carrying a lifetime of guilt.


“Mara,” he greeted quietly, dipping his head.


“I brought back what belongs to you,” Mara said, taking a small vial from her bag.


Guard touched the glass, and something shifted in his eyes — a strange reverence, almost religious, like he understood exactly what he was holding.

No one spoke. We stepped inside the living room.
The house was spotless, perfectly maintained — but it didn’t feel lived in. More like a shrine.

Guard snapped open the cap of the vial. A vein trembled across his hand as he lifted it. Then he drank the thick, dark liquid in one swallow.

The transformation wasn’t violent.
It wasn’t loud.
It was quiet — and so much worse for that.

Soft cracking came from beneath his ribs.
His chest stretched. His spine adjusted with slow, brittle pops as if invisible fingers were reshaping him.

He didn’t scream. He didn’t plead. He only trembled, like a man deep in prayer.

His body rose inch by inch, growing taller, thinner, until he resembled a stretched-out skeleton more than a man. Shadows flickered between his ribs. His eyes went black… then faintly glowed.

When it was over, Guard looked at Mara with something like pleading — waiting for her acknowledgment.


“Welcome back, my friend,” Mara said softly.


The towering, bone-thin man straightened and offered her a gentle smile.

Mara didn’t let us pause. She motioned for me to follow and rolled toward a locked door in the living room. I expected a storage space, like in her own house — but it was just a simple guest room.


“Clear it out,” she said as Guard opened the door. “I need to prepare.”


“Mara? What is all this?” I asked immediately.


“David…” Her voice wavered. “Please. Just do what I ask. When there’s time, we’ll talk.”


She disappeared into a different room.

Guard moved with military precision.
Despite how thin he’d become, some unnatural strength filled him — he carried dressers, shelves, even the bed frame alone. At times I felt like he didn’t need my help at all.

The sun went down. Silence filled the house like fog.
We carried all the furniture into the backyard. Guard didn’t speak a single word.
When we finished, he went to the garage and returned with paint — blinding white paint.
No label. No brand. Nothing human.


“It must be perfect,” Guard said. “No dust. No stain. The light must be pure.”


I nodded. There was no point asking anything.
We painted for hours. The same walls again and again, layering white upon white.
Guard’s movements were slow, deliberate — like a priest performing a ritual. By midnight, the room glowed with a sterile, unnatural brightness.
Mara had gone to bed early.
Her eyes were tired, but her mouth set in that hard, determined line that meant this was only the beginning.

I collapsed on the couch. I couldn’t make myself go upstairs.

Guard didn’t sleep.

He sat outside the white room all night, long legs folded beneath him, back straight, palms resting on his knees. He didn’t blink. He barely breathed.

The wooden chest sat in his arms, held like something sacred, or cursed — or both.

When I woke the next morning, he was still in the exact same position.
Still watching the white door.

Mara was already awake too, stronger and colder than the night before.


“Guard, give me the chest,” she said as she rolled toward him.


Guard lifted it slowly — reverently — and handed it over. It felt like the most difficult motion he’d made all night.
Mara opened the lid carefully. I stood where I could see.
Inside were five wooden figures, each placed in its own velvet-lined compartment:
A man. A bull. A rooster. A bird. A dog.

I didn’t say a word — but something clenched tight in my chest.
These weren’t toys. They weren’t decorations. They were… something more.

It also explained why the chest felt far too heavy for five wooden carvings.


“David. Come,” Mara said.


I followed her into the blinding white room.


“Put in the bulb. Up there,” she said, pointing to the ceiling fixture.


I found the lightbulb sitting in the corner.
Funny — I didn’t remember seeing it before. We had scrubbed the room clean.

But when I screwed it in, everything made sense.

The light snapped on with a hiss — too bright, too sharp, wrong in a way I felt in my bones.
When I turned toward Mara, shadows crawled across the smooth white walls.


“Go outside, David,” she ordered. “Wait for me. I’ll come when I can.”


“Okay, Mara,” I muttered, sounding like a scolded kid.


She shut the door behind me and locked it from the inside.

I stood there with Guard.


“It begins now,” he said, inhaling deeply. “We must call them onto the walls. Without the signs, the door opens too early. And if it opens…” He paused, shaking his head. “That won’t be our concern anymore.”


“Whose signs? What is Mara doing in there?” I asked, completely lost.


Guard looked at me with a blend of sorrow and faith.


“The Five. Those who followed her.”


Morning sunlight streamed through the windows. But it still felt like midnight.

Guard pressed a paintbrush into my hand. Then carried over the remaining white paint.


“We begin. Before something on the other side starts to move,” he said, voice low and firm.


That’s when I heard it.
A faint, rasping scratch from behind the white door. Something was in there with Mara.
Guard began painting the shapes — the same as the wooden figures — onto the walls, steady and unblinking.

I stared at the paint-sticky brush in my hand.

And one thought wouldn’t leave me:

I could leave.
Right now.
While she’s locked in there.

I could take the car and drive farther than the road even goes.


————————————————————————————


I haven’t found anything about these things anywhere. But after everything that’s happened, I’m sure we haven’t heard the last of them.
If I learn anything else, I’ll let you know.
Until then, here are the events so far.
