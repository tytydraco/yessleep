I *love* Halloween. It’s by far my favorite holiday, easily blows Christmas out of the water in my opinion. I love everything about it, from the orange and black decorations to the goofy costumes to the Jack O’Lantern carving. And of course, I love the candy (who doesn’t?). 

This year I had been planning to go to my best friend Liz’s Halloween party, as I do annually, but life works in cruel ways and instead I would be spending my time at home babysitting my sister’s children. Cecilia had called me at six this morning telling me that her husband’s father had had a stroke. They needed to be out of state immediately, and they didn’t want to bring the kids along because they believed them too young to be exposed to all of that. 

I obviously wasn’t going to be a selfish asshole and say no, so I somberly agreed that I’d look after them until tomorrow.

They dropped them off less than an hour later. I I had a brief conversation with a grim-faced Cecilia, who informed me that Michael’s father was currently in critical care, and there was a chance that he may not make it. 

I wished them luck and they departed, leaving me with Alice, age five, and Sam, age four, who were under the impression that mommy and daddy had to go see grandpa because grandpa had a cold. 

After using my culinary genius to scrape together two egg and cheese bagel sandwiches out of my sparsely stocked fridge, I set the TV to Netflix Kids Mode and let my niece and nephew choose whatever they wanted to watch. I’m really bad with kids, and my house isn’t exactly kid-friendly either, as I have numerous paintings of peculiar alchemical, gothic, and occult art that could easily freak out adults, let alone children, decorating the walls.

 It was particularly awkward sitting there with them watching TV because right above the TV I have a giant Japanese *Ero Guro Nansensu* painting depicting a naked woman with a bag covering her face lying over the head of a tiger with a grinning clown, skeleton, and  man with piercing, wide eyes in front.

 Yes, I am a little weird.

Thankfully, neither of the two siblings questioned it and quietly watched some animated movie about humanoid animals racing cars (I didn’t actually catch the title). I asked them if they wanted to go Trick or Treating tonight and they both shook their heads no. I guessed they were still a little too young for that. 

My brain heaved a mental sigh of relief. I had been worried that I would have to go around the neighborhood Trick or Treating with them, and keeping an eye on two tiny kids in a sea of others was, to me, a stress level equivalent to performing open heart surgery. 

The first ring of the doorbell came at exactly six forty-seven, I opened the door to a boy dressed as Batman. 

He gave the famed beggars sing-song line, “Trick Or Treat!” and I gave him a KitKat and a bag of M&Ms. 

After the Disney movie had ended, I had taken Sam and Alice with me to Walmart and bought a bunch of candy, as well as their choice of an extra large chocolate bar, chip bag, and pop. Alice had eaten her entire Cadbury bar during the drive back, getting brown stains all over her face, which Sam thought was utterly hilarious. 

“Poo! You got poo on your face Alice!” He kept shouting every time he got his hysterical laughter under control enough to speak. Alice had also started giggling madly, which made me start losing it too. 

The doorbell began ringing constantly once the gray sky shifted to an inky blue around seven. With my speaker blasting Halloween classics, Alice, Sam and I worked as a team, giving out candy to all of the mummies, princesses, jedi, and other personas, the greatest trio since The Three Musketeers. 

Sam and Alice had gone to the kitchen to get a drink while I dumped some Cheetos and chocolate bars into Darth Vader’s pillowcase. He and The Terminator gleefully said their thanks and hurried down the driveway, hungry for more free goodies.

They raced past a tall figure garbed in the classic bedsheet ghost outfit. I actually thought that this was their dad waiting for them, but he started up the driveway while they fully ignored him. 

He stepped up a few feet from me and I realized that he must have been a teenager not willing to give up free candy just yet, or maybe just a really big kid. 

“Trick or Treat!” He said in a giddy, high-pitched, and slightly muffled voice. 

I realized that he was indeed the latter, a really tall kid, probably hit his growth spurt early, and I grabbed some candy out of the pumpkin shaped plastic bowl it rested in. 

He held out a completely empty pillowcase. I found it a bit odd that he had just started Trick or Treating, the night had been going strong for over an hour, but disregarded it and threw in some sweets. He must have been wearing some kind of skin suit, because he held out the pillowcase with clothed black hands, and the same fabric was present behind the holes cut out in the sheet for eyes. 

“Really original costume.” I joked, not unkindly. 

He giggled but didn’t say anything, then turned and walked away up Barnes Street. I guess he didn’t get the sarcasm. 

The Trick or Treaters began thinning out as the long hand ticked closer to nine. Alice, Sam and I gave some of the last remaining scraps of our candy, Almond Joys (gross) to what I expected to be the final visitors of the year. 

Alice yawned. 

“Uh… guess it’s almost time for you guys to get to bed.” I said. 

“Do we have to? I’m not sleepy.” Sam said, but his drooping eyelids betrayed his words. 

Chuckling, I told them to go upstairs and get ready for bed. 

I turned the Halloween hits off and plugged in the speaker, feeling a little drowsy myself. Who knew how tiring handing out candy was? I was cleaning up some juice the kids had spilled in the kitchen when there was a knock at the door. 

*That’ll be the last one.* I thought as I made my way over. I was greeted by the tall bedsheet ghost from earlier. 

“You again. You do a circle around the neighborhood or something?” 

“Trick or Treat!” He said in the same excited, childish voice. Except.. it wasn’t a child’s voice. No, what it sounded like was a man putting on a very convincing child’s voice, but I could still make out its faint low pitch and huskiness. 

*Okay, I guess it’s a teenager going for one last hurrah.* 

I tossed the last of the Almond Joys into his pillowcase, which was HUGE. I mean, this thing looked like it weighed at least twenty pounds, it was totally stuffed to the brim, outlines of dozens of tiny edges and corners of candy pressing against the inside of the fabric. 

He continued to stand there silently, his empty black eyes staring at me lifelessly. 

“That’s it. Sorry, we’re all out.” 

He giggled, a weird, unnatural sound, high-pitched but manly, artificial. He remained statuelike on my doorstep. 

I was about to say something but before I could, he spun around and hurried away, moving uncannily similar to the way a small child of five or six would move, not someone of at least sixteen. 

I rarely ever get creeped out, I have Zdzisław Beksiński paintings next to my nightstand for God’s sake, and this was nothing different. I suspected that he was a teenager trying to be creepy or that he may have had a mental disability. I dismissed it and went back to cleaning. 

“Maggie!” Sam’s voice called from the second floor. He sounded upset. 

“Yeah?” I shouted back, heading up the stairs. “Is something wrong?” 

No answer.

 “Sam? Where are you?” I called. feeling a drop of frigid anxiety leak into my bloodstream.

Then I saw him scurrying over to me, eyes wide and afraid. I got to my knees and held his shoulders, genuinely worried.

 “Sam? What’s the matter? Where’s Alice?” 

He wouldn’t make eye contact for a few moments, but when he finally did he whispered: 

“The ladies in the bathroom are scary.” 

“The la- oh!” I let out a relieved chuckle, my blood turning warm again. 

“The Ladies in the Bathroom” was the *Women Laughing* painting by Francisco Goya hung over the toilet. It definitely *was* one of the scariest ones in the house. 

I went into the bathroom, took the framed artwork down, tucked it behind the shower curtain, and told Sam that it was safe to come inside now, which he did very slowly and hesitantly. 

I didn’t have a guest room or extra bed, so Sam and Alice would sleep together in my bed and I would sleep on the pullout couch in my office across the hall. I took down the paintings in the bedroom and put them in the closet just in case, then tucked the two siblings into bed. 

“Did you guys brush your teeth?” I asked. 

“Yes.” They said in unison.

“Are you sure? Let me see your teeth. Say *eee*,” I said, flashing my pearly whites like a jaguar. They giggled and repeated, proving their cleanliness. 

I laughed. 

“Okay, goodnight. Just call me if you need anything. I’m right across the hall.” 

“Okay.” Alice said. 

“Goodnight.” Sam said. 

I smiled, hesitated for a moment, then kissed them both on the forehead and left. Without realizing it, I had become extremely comfortable and fond of those two, and didn’t feel awkward around them at all anymore. 

I descended back down to the ground level and started flicking through Netflix, searching for a horror movie that I hadn’t seen yet, which were few and far between. I decided to go for *Halloween III: Season of the Witch,* dimmed the lights, and was about to fire up a bag of microwave popcorn when the doorbell rang. 

I jumped (I might not get scared easily but no one is immune to an unexpected jumpscare) and moved towards the door. What kind of semen-demon kid was Trick Or Treating at ten at night?

I was about to twist the doorknob open when I decided that maybe I should glance through the peephole first. 

It was the bedsheet ghost again. 

Now I was pissed off. It was late, the candy jar was empty, I was exhausted, and I just wanted to relax and watch a movie. 

“Look, kid,” I said, loud enough for him to hear me through the door but not enough that Sam and Alice could hear me upstairs. 

“I told you I don’t have any candy left, go home.” I waited for him to turn and leave, but he stood still, like he was cosplaying one of the British Royal Guards instead of a ghost. 

Then I could hear something. It was very faint and I had to lean closer to make it out over the sound of the movie playing in the living room. For a moment I wasn’t sure what I was hearing. Then the realization hit me.

It sounded like he was trying extremely hard not to laugh, like he had just been told the greatest joke of all time but lived in an era where laughter was prohibited by law. It came out in little whimpers and stifles and straining my eyes against the peephole I could see that his body was shaking with the effort. 

“Trick or Treat!” He warbled in that same forced, childish voice. 

He let out a chortle and then quickly sucked it back in, nearly sobbing with muffled laughter.

“This isn’t funny, prick.” I said, angry but careful not to raise my voice any higher. “Fuck off.” 

This caused an intense bout of stifled snickers and snorts. 

“Trick or Treat! Trick or Treat, give me something sweet to eat!” He called, half laughing and with all the excitement of a kid on Christmas morning. 

“Fuck off before I come out there and beat your dumbass.” I repeated. “I’m calling the cops if you don’t leave in the next five seconds. Five, four-”

He giggled feverishly and took off, his shoes making loud crunching noises as he ran right through my flower garden, bedsheet flapping behind him. This pissed me off even further. I had been growing coneflowers and he had just trampled through weeks of hard work. I would have yelled something vulgar after his fleeing ass but restrained myself only because of Alice and Sam upstairs. 

Wanting to take the edge off, I cracked open a bottle of whiskey as I sat down to watch *Halloween III*, rewinding back to the beginning, before I was interrupted by the comedian of the year, the Sheet Specter. 

I don’t know exactly when, but I had fallen asleep sometime during the movie and awoken a few hours later, still in the middle of the night. Netflix had switched to some other movie, whatever was next in the suggested list I guess, so I shut it off. I groggily dragged myself up the stairs and into my office, too drowsy and tired to bother brushing my teeth. I glanced out the window at the dark, vacant lot and Cobalt Lane behind it. I flicked the light on.

What was that outside?

I flicked the light back off, my bright reflection in the window disappearing, and stared out into the darkness. 

He was standing right at the edge of the empty grass lot separating my house from Cobalt Lane, his homemade costume dimly illuminated by the streetlight. 

I gasped and dropped my phone. It thudded against the wooden floor. I scooped it back up and started punching in the magic numbers. 

*“911, what is your emergency?”* A woman’s voice spoke over a light electronic rasp. 

 “Hi, there’s this creep outside my house. I’m not sure if he’s a perv or what but I’ve got two young kids with me and I want him gone.” 

*“What exactly is he doing, ma’am?”* The operator asked. 

“He…” 

The figure stared back at me with the empty circles, his pretend eyes. The hazy light washing over the white sheet made him look eerily like a real ghost, like some ethereal phantom from the realm of dreams. 

“Well, he’s… just standing there. But, but I mean this is just harassment at this point, he’s already been here three times tonight.” 

*“Okay, what’s the name and address?”* 

“Maggie Jeong, Four-fifty Porter Avenue. Wait, he’s doing something.”

Because they were under the sheet, I hadn’t been able to tell that the ghost had his arms behind his back. He had now brought them forwards, and was holding his pillowcase from before, which had inflated to even larger proportions. It now looked like a porcupine had been growing inside of it from all the points of candy sticking out. I was amazed that the case hadn’t ripped and spilled its guts all over the place.  

He flipped the bag over and started shaking it. Clumps of wrappers, some empty and some still with their contents untouched, began pouring onto the grass. The cloth suddenly lost most of its weight as a large, clunky object thudded to the ground. 

It took me two seconds to register what I was looking at, then two seconds longer to scream. 

*“Ma’am? What’s going on?!”* 

“It-he- he just dumped a fucking head out of the bag!” I cried. Despite the distance, I could easily make out the bright red message which looked to be finger painted onto the forehead: **BOO**

*“Okay, ma’am, ma’am? I need you to stay on the line with me. The police are on their way. Are all your doors and windows locked?”* 

“Y-yes.” I managed, panic constricting around my throat like a cobra. 

*“Good. Okay, you said there’s two kids with you, where are they?”* 

Speak of the devil, at that exact moment Sam and Alice burst into the room, looking frightened. 

“Maggie? What’s wrong? What’s happening?” Alice cried.

“They’re with me, on the second floor.” I answered the operator. 

“Everything will be okay,” I told the two siblings while I listened to the voice on the phone. “Just don’t look out the window.” 

Of course, that immediately provoked them to try and catch a glance out, but I put my body between them, attempting to prevent any lifelong trauma. 

*“Is he still standing in the same spot?”* The operator asked. 

“Yes, he’s standing there with the-, the thing at his feet. Wait, he’s raising his arms-” 

I was about to scream at my niece and nephew to duck for cover, thinking that he had a gun, but instead he raced across the grass while bellowing a chilling, uncanny scream, still in that faux-child tone, sheet flapping behind him like a cape. 

I gasped harshly and Sam and Alice began crying.

*“Ma’am, what’s happening?”* 

“Stay here!” I ordered the kids as I sprinted downstairs, unconsciously dropping the phone somewhere on the way. 

Time lagged to a crawl for a split-second as I glided across the kitchen, grabbing  a knife while simultaneously, the White Devil outside charged within inches of the house. We momentarily locked stares through the window, eyes-to-holes contact, before the earth’s rotation snapped back to it’s routine pace and I swerved to a halt. 

He slammed on the window with his fists, creating a snowflake-esque crack across its surface as he let out another wail. 

“TRICK OR TREAT! TRICK OR TREAT! GIVE ME SOMETHING SWEET TO EAT!” He began screaming at the top of his lungs over and over again, his voice becoming more and more slurred and distorted with each word.

 “TRICK OR TREAT! TRICK OR TREAT!”

He pounded on the window again.

“GET THE FUCK OUT!” I roared like a wild animal, a whirlwind of emotions flying through my brain, my hand slightly shaking as I brandished the knife around in the air. 

He moaned like a wounded elephant and pummeled the glass once more. This time it shattered to pieces and he howled with a mixture of laughter and sobs. 

“HAPPY HALLOWEEN!”

My conscious mind jumped off a cliff and into freezing water, completely numb and void of any thinking capability. 

He swung his leg upwards, but before he could hop over the ruined window, a voice, a voice that sounded very far away and very muffled, as if my ears were under the same polar water as my brain, bellowed: 

*“Police! Put your hands in the air!”*

The cloaked demon appeared to move in slow motion as he turned his head, gazing into the distance as he seemed to try and determine what exactly he was looking at. Then he made his decision. He threw his arms towards the sky, howling in that ghoulish voice and barreled to the left, out of sight. 

I counted five thunderclaps cracking the night sky open.  

After what felt like long enough for my feet to become rooted to the carpet, a cop appeared in the empty window frame, causing me to jump, shriek, and nearly fling the knife at him. 

He spoke in a reassuring, calming tone. 

“It’s over, Miss.” 

I did not breathe a sigh of relief until I saw Sam and Alice stampeding down the stairs, crying. They swarmed around me, hugging and clutching onto my body. I patted their heads and brushed their hair, trying to sooth them, but barely keeping it together myself. 

I did not want them any farther than an inch away from me, but eventually the cop who had spoken to me, Officer Belmar, convinced me to let him speak to them for just a minute because “there was something that I needed to see.” 

The other three cops were crowded around the wall of the house, just staring downwards, dumbfounded. I could see the white sheet, now covered in red splotches like it was an abstract art piece, but I could not see his face. 

“What is it?” I asked. My voice came out as a hoarse rasp, almost like a death rattle. 

“It’s… well, see for yourself.” A tall, bearded cop said. 

I stepped forward and he moved aside. 

I’m not sure how I can describe my reaction, mostly because I don’t remember it. My brain seemed to have shut down at that moment, once again divebombing headfirst into arctic waves, my consciousness taking vacation time. 

The reddened bedsheet had been removed, revealing a mouth with two rows of gnarled, cracked teeth covered in melted brown chocolate. The lips were furled back and dry, dead and peeling like sunburnt skin. 

The rest of his face was empty. There was no nose, eyes, or even ears, just blank, unmarked grayish-white skin, like a Word Document without any writing on it. 

Neither the cops nor I spoke about it, or maybe we did, I don’t remember. But I’m pretty sure that we didn’t. It felt taboo to speak of… whatever *it* was. They sealed it inside a glossy body bag and loaded it into one of their cruisers. I don’t know where they took it. Hopefully they burnt it.

The severed head, which I either didn’t bother going over to look at, or just completely blocked from memory, was identified by one of the cops as belonging to a local homeless junkie named Dale Skinner.  

Sam, Alice, and I spent the rest of the night at the police station. They clung to me the entire time until Cecilia and Michael arrived at around ten. They had been called about a home invasion, one where the intruder had been shot and killed by police. Michael’s father had been nursed to stable condition, and he would make a full recovery. They invited, actually, more like ordered me to stay with them for the next couple of days and I agreed without argument, I did not want to leave Sam and Alice’s side. 

There was no mention of the incident on any of the news channels the next day, myself and the four cops present at the time seemed to have had a mutual, silent pact to never utter a word about that night. It was best not to mess with things beyond our understanding. 

I have since moved from that house, which was a hell of a process due to all of my art needing to be transported as delicately as newborn babies, but I’m now living in a studio apartment downtown. Sam and Alice visit me frequently and the three of us have become quite inseparable. 

I have been able to block out the memories of that Halloween for the most part, but every so often a mouth without a face appears in my dreams, biting, hungry, and wailing a scream of inhumanity. 

Halloween is coming up again soon. I think I might just stay home this year and watch a movie. Something lighthearted. Sweet.
