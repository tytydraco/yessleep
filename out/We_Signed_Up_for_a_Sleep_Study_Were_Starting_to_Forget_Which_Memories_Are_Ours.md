It started with an ad. A simple black-and-white flyer tacked onto a corkboard at the local café: “Sleep Study Volunteers Needed. $2,000 for One Week. Meals Included.” My roommate Alex and I didn’t hesitate. We were broke, our rent was overdue, and the thought of being paid to sleep seemed like a godsend.

The facility was nothing special—just a bland, nondescript building on the outskirts of town. Inside, the hallways were sterile, lit with buzzing fluorescent lights that flickered just enough to be annoying. A man in a white lab coat greeted us, introducing himself as Dr. Hargrove. He had the kind of unsettlingly perfect smile that made you wonder what he was hiding.

The study was straightforward. They would monitor our brain activity while we slept and expose us to “light cognitive stimuli” through soundtracks and subliminal imagery. It sounded benign enough, and they made us sign a mountain of paperwork before leading us to our rooms. Each of us had our own small, windowless chamber with a bed, a desk, and a nightstand. Mounted on the ceiling was a small black camera, its red light glowing faintly.

The first few nights were uneventful. They hooked us up to machines that read our brain waves, played us soothing sounds, and let us sleep. I felt fine, aside from the slightly odd dreams—a jumble of random scenes, some familiar and others not. But by the third night, things got… strange.

I was in my high school cafeteria, sitting with my old friends. We were laughing, throwing french fries, just like we used to. But something was off. A boy I didn’t recognize was at our table. He smiled at me like he’d known me for years, and I smiled back, even though I didn’t know why.

When I woke up, the memory lingered. It felt vivid, real, like something that had actually happened. But I couldn’t place the boy. Who was he? Why did I feel so certain he belonged in that moment?

When I mentioned it to Alex over breakfast, he froze mid-bite. “I had something like that too,” he said. “I dreamed I was at my grandparents’ house, but there was this… woman there. She kept calling me by a nickname no one’s ever used for me, but it felt… right.”

We laughed it off, chalking it up to weird dreams, but I noticed Alex seemed uneasy the rest of the day.

By the fifth night, things were unraveling. The dreams were no longer just dreams—they felt like memories being dropped into my mind, but they didn’t belong to me.

I woke up with a sharp jolt, sweating and gasping. In my dream, I’d been on a beach, holding hands with a little girl as we built a sandcastle. She called me “Mommy,” and I remember feeling this overwhelming wave of love for her. But I don’t have kids. I’ve never been to that beach. And yet, the memory clung to me as though it was mine.

Alex wasn’t faring any better. He told me he’d woken up in tears after dreaming of an elderly man he claimed was his “Uncle Roy,” even though Alex doesn’t have an uncle by that name. “I don’t understand,” he said, his voice trembling. “I can picture his face, his laugh, the way he used to tell me stories by the fireplace. But he doesn’t exist, does he?”

I didn’t know how to respond. It felt like the edges of our minds were fraying, unraveling thread by thread.

The sixth night was the worst. They increased the stimuli, or at least that’s what the technicians said. My dreams weren’t dreams anymore. They were fragments—some familiar, others alien. I saw my mother teaching me how to ride a bike, but then her face morphed into that of a stranger, and the memory shifted. Suddenly, I was running through a forest, chasing after a boy who called me his sister. The next moment, I was standing at an altar, staring into the eyes of a man I’ve never met, saying, “I do.”

When I woke up, I couldn’t tell what was real. My childhood memories felt foreign, like I was viewing them through someone else’s eyes. And the new memories—those strange, vivid scenes—they felt… lived in. As if they were mine.

I stumbled out of my room and found Alex sitting in the hallway, his head in his hands. “I can’t do this anymore,” he whispered. “I can’t even remember my mom’s face. But I remember some woman named Karen teaching me how to fish. Who the hell is Karen?”

We decided to confront Dr. Hargrove. He dismissed our concerns with a calm, patronizing smile. “You’re experiencing side effects of memory consolidation,” he said. “It’s perfectly normal. The brain is a complex organ, and we’re pushing its boundaries. Please, return to your rooms.”

But we couldn’t. Not after what we’d seen.

That night, I refused to sleep. I sat on the edge of my bed, staring at the red light on the camera, daring it to blink. Around 3 a.m., I heard footsteps outside my door. It was Alex. He looked pale, his eyes wide and bloodshot.

“They’re in my head,” he whispered. “They’re not just messing with memories—they’re implanting them.”

I wanted to tell him he was being paranoid, but deep down, I knew he was right.

We made a plan to leave, but the doors were locked, and the technicians stood guard. Desperation drove us to hide in the bathroom until morning, when the staff would do their shift change. But as we sat there in the dark, Alex said something that made my blood run cold.

“I don’t remember how we got here.”

I opened my mouth to respond, but then I froze. I couldn’t remember either. The flyer, the café, signing up for the study—it all felt… hazy, like trying to recall a dream after waking up.

It’s been a week since the study ended. They let us go, but we’re not the same. I catch glimpses of strangers in my mind, moments that don’t belong to me. Sometimes I hear a child’s laughter, faint and distant, like an echo in my brain.

Alex moved out yesterday. He left a note, scrawled in shaky handwriting: “I’m not me anymore.”

The worst part? I’m starting to forget him too. His face, his voice—they’re slipping away, replaced by memories of someone else. A woman named Karen, who used to call me her sister.

I don’t know who I am anymore. Or if I ever really knew.
