I don’t really know how to explain this without sounding crazy. Honestly I’m really hesitant to even post this, partially because I’m worried no one will understand, but also because I’m worried this is all real and I’m putting myself in danger. I’ll try my best to write this out coherently and keep it as easy to understand as possible. I’m going to be leaving out some details just for my own safety. I apologize if some of the information doesn’t make sense or seems inconsistent, I have bouts of bad memory. I don’t know how to start or explain any of this.


I can’t put an exact date down, or really even a general time of when I noticed these things. I know logically it can’t have always been this way, but I struggle to remember a time where it was different. It feels like I’ve been stuck in this nightmare for so long, I find myself forgetting who I was before. 

If my memory serves me right, which I can’t trust anymore, it started getting bad midway through high school. Everyday, things just seemed, for lack of better words, wrong. I’d wake up in the morning and have this terrible eerie feeling. Like something really bad was gonna happen. I’ve always been intuitive and felt deeply connected to energy, so I always had strong feelings. But this was different. It wasn’t like I was worried about a test, or about drama in friend groups, or anything like that. It was like I knew something was shifting in the cosmos and it was terrible. I used to throw up nearly every morning.

Of course, I and my mom had just blamed it on anxiety, which I was diagnosed with when I was a kid. But it felt like it was only getting worse. I started noticing that the people around me were off. They stopped feeling like the kids I went to middle school with and more like strangers. Not like their personalities changed, but that I felt like they were literally different people, strangers. And it didn’t feel like a stranger you’d see in a grocery store or mall. It felt like when its dark out and your alone and see someone walking towards you. 

I got this terrible gut feeling about “friends” I had for years and I just know something was going on. They looked at me differently and it always seemed like they knew something I didn’t. I could see the looks they shared with each other and I knew it was about me. At first it was just my “friends”, but it slowly starting infecting other people.

It was terrifying. Everywhere I went, knew everyone was looking at me, even if they tried to hide it. It’s like they all had some conspiracy against me. I know I sound crazy and if I were anyone else, I wouldn’t believe me. But I know it’s true. 

My first instinct was to get away from all of them. I still dont know what they are, if they’re human. But I was scared. I distanced myself the best I could, but they wouldn’t leave me alone. I didn’t want to belive there was something wrong, I wanted it to be a misunderstanding. But time and time again I could see through their lies and covers. 

I stopped going to school. I had begged my mom, who was the only person I could still rely on, to transfer to me online. It was perfect for a while. I could wake up whenever I wanted, start school whenever, and never have to leave the house. No more bad feelings, no more people trying to get me. 

But slowly over time, I felt it coming closer. Bit by bit, the feeling of doom returned. Sometimes, the house was too quiet. Inhuman kind of quiet, like something was making it that way. To put me at ease. I kept it in the back of my mind, but like before, I tried to ignore it and convince myself I was imagining things. 

The dark corners of my house started to scare me more. I couldn’t be anywhere without my back to the wall. All day, I’d stay in my room unless absolutely necessary. I felt this evil in the house, surrounding it. The only time I’d spend more than 5 minutes outside my room was when my family got home. And even then, I began to notice a change in them too.

There was a specific incident that made me realize it had all become too much. Like usual, I was in my room doing schoolwork. I think it was about 10 or 11 am. I heard glass shattering in the kitchen. This obviously freaked me out, but I had to remember it was probably just one of my cats. I feel so dumb for ignoring all the signs.

I grabbed my pocket knife for protection, just in case, and went to go check it out. It was probably dumb to think whatever these thing are can be hurt. When I got to the kitchen, there was nothing, no broken glass. I looked everywhere but I couldn’t find it. Now I know it was leading me there on purpose. 

Just as I was about to leave the kitchen, I hear a voice yell loud as hell in my ear. “Hey!”

It freaked me out so much I nearly fell over. I kept looking around to see where it came from, but there was nothing. I tried to run back to my room, where I know I would’ve had the best chance at being safe. But these shadow like things kept moving around me, coming at me. They didn’t have a particular shape them, just dark masses or shadow, big enough to be a grown man. I stared right at them and tried to convince myself it wasn’t there, but I couldn’t. It was the middle of the day and the house was so light, I knew these weren’t just my eyes playing tricks on me. This thing, whatever it was, had gotten into the house. 

I had no where to go, I was blocked in. There was absolutely nothing I could do. So I just sat down with my back against the cabinets and waited for them to finally get what they wanted. But they just kept taunting me. They didn’t say anything in any language I’ve ever heard, but they were so loud. I don’t want to go into too much detail. I don’t want to find out the consequences.

That was the most exhausting day of my life. I sat there for hours until my mom came home. I tried to tell her what I had seen, finally let her know what’s been happening, but then I felt it. That eerie feeling, that something was wrong. She told me it was alright, and that I was just imagining it from lack of sleep. I thought for a second that she was making no sense, but it all clicked into place. I was looking at my “mom” and felt nothing. Just as I did before with the people outside, I felt like I was looking at a stranger.

I was able to convince her I believed what she was saying and I went back to my room. It’s been days since then and I’ve barely left. I’m just so lost and I have no clue what to do. I have no one to get help from and I can trust anyone. I can’t even sleep at night because of how terrifying this is. I know whatever those shadow things are, are trying to get to me. My “mom” keeps trying to convince me to come out for dinner and stuff, but I know it’s just a trap, like before. 

It’s getting harder and harder to stay inside. I’m so tired and my body just sort of aches. I feel like I’ve uncovered stuff I was never supposed to see. This is pretty much my last attempt at finding someone who can help me. I’ve tried to do research and I’ve found a lot of possibilities, but I don’t know how to make things better. I just want to go back to how things were before.

If anyone has any idea what these things are, or what’s going on, I need to know. All of this is just wrong. I’m scared all the time.
