Liquor ran smooth down my parched throat, ice cubes slid cold against my hot lips, and the AC droned behind me, spitting irregular gusts that ruffled my thinning hair softly. The bar was quiet that time of night and only the real alcoholics were left, fools like me, I suppose, bathing in the booze and the dim glow of the arc sodium lights. But the barkeep kept pouring, and I kept paying, and the alcohol still felt good, whether it was my first drink or my tenth.

It’d been a long day at the end of a long week at the end of a long, long string of long months. My bi-monthly trips down the pub for a beer with the pals had turned into bi-weekly trips without the pals, I suppose my mood had been irritable, and they weren’t the most tolerable folk around when they were sober. A drink or

(ten)

two was the best course of action, a release of tension in a single swig. Some people are just predisposed to the bottle, you know? My Daddy was a drunkard and my grandaddy before him, and I imagine had I a son, he’d turn out much like me – a pathetic mess slumped over a scuffed bar in a hovel more often than not. I tell you all of this to say: I’m not always in the right state of mind, I have been for some weeks now, since *it* happened, but I certainly wasn’t when I saw *it*. Suppose I’m trying to say, I know what I saw and it sobered me up pretty damn quick.

So, it all began in the bar, like I said. I’d had my usual dozen or so and needed to relieve myself. Swallowing the rest of whatever it was I was having and crunching the ice-cubes, I staggered to the loo. Like most of my usual haunts, the place wasn’t pretty. I imagine it hadn’t seen a cleaning crew since it was built, if it ever had. Fumbling into the stall, I caught a glimpse of the mirror, shattered and lopsided on the smeared ‘white’ tiles. Something about it just caught my eye, I suppose, something was just off, and I know what it was now, though I did not then. I urinated, left, came back to wash my hands (filled with a sudden sense of righteous hygiene) and found myself before the twisted grin of glittering teeth, each reflecting a man, one most certainly not myself.

His eyes shone under the sickly fluorescent lighting. His hair, swept into a fashionable comb-over, was thick and lustrous, far from seeing the first fleck of grey. His skin was smooth, flushed healthily. A smile widened across his face, and pearly whites twinkled in the dull light. I blinked. He was gone, and in his place was I, face reddened and blotchy, eyes deep and hollow, hair grey and thin.

The water was cool on my face, sputtering from the rusted tap. I sipped it from my cupped hands, letting it flow and pool in the clogged basin. My eyes had deceived me, just another figment of the drink (one of many). At the time, I’d brushed it off, washed away the last of my flustered shock, and left, letting the door bang on my way out. With my wallet empty, my stomach churning, and my liver most certainly crying out for mercy, I decided to call it a night. Stumbling back to the bar in a drunken stupor, I raised a hand in greeting, calling over the barkeep to thank him. The little telly in the corner blared a weather report,

(Make sure to keep an umbrella handy tonight, folks! We’re expecting a high chance of torrential rain and possible floods in the south!)

one I heard and ignored. A lanky man slumped against the bar, rubbing a cloth on several wet glasses and mopping up spilled suds of beer. He threw a smile and a greeting my way.

‘You off then, old fella?’

‘I think I’d better be, maybe I’ve had one too many… as per usual!’ A sick, self-depreciative chuckle rattled from my chapped lips.

Setting down the cloth, he sighed and chuckled back, but he did not say anything. After a brief pause, he nodded to the door, and I went.

He called after me, a generic remark of his: ‘Don’t be driving! Not in your state, mister!’

I slid my finger through the ring of my car key and started towards my little black Clio.

The weather report was right, I realised that about halfway home, when I began to swerve (more than I already was). My headlights cut through the dark, a nimbus of rain caught in their effulgent grin. The bends are a little tight where I live, and each one left the little car scrabbling for traction, wet tires on wet tarmac. The rumble of the engine and the churning of the rain and the steady thrum of my heartbeat pounded in my ears. The rain just kept coming, pouring from pregnant, gunmetal clouds. Some news reporter rambled about the weather and some corrupt politician, and a new war out west, when I went into the field. I’d looked up into the rear-view to check my hair, of all things, and there he was again, the man in the mirror, with his thick, dark hair and wide, plastic smile. He’d made me jump, and that was all it took.

When I woke, there was some pop rubbish screeching on and on, blaring from the radio – I remember that much. The rain had slowed to a gentle pitter-patter on the shattered windscreen, little more than piss falling from the cloud-mottled sky. It was light out, early morning. A thin layer of ground mist remained on the dewy grass, and the sky was a faint pewter. It was the man who startled me, grinning his shit-eating grin in the rear-view mirror. Blood matted his hair to his skull in a gory helmet. He grinned on. He had a shiner on his left eye, purple and bloated. He grinned on. His lip was cut, weeping a steady trickle of blood down his white shirt. He grinned on. But I wasn’t grinning. It was here I noticed how much he looked like me, some decades ago. Whilst I’d never been quite that… handsome, he had my eyes and my face, my nose before it was broken, and my hair before it thinned. Then I blinked, he was gone, and soon after, the screaming began.

I left the hospital a few days later, it was far from as bad as it looked. A few bruises, one on the eye where I’d hit the wheel, and a series of them on my chest. A few minor cuts on the face and a major one on my forehead, but a few stitches sorted that. The alcohol was mostly gone by the time they found me, enough so to keep me in the hospital and not in prison. In some ways, this account is a confession – let’s hope there isn’t anyone monitoring me. The whole ordeal was cleared off as an accident, one caused by poor driving conditions and a tired, tired man. I’d thought it was the end of everything, a drunken hallucination of a man who looked like me? Plausible enough. So, I went right on back to the bar the following week, a drink had sounded oh so nice after what had been a terrible few days. Then I started seeing him in the amber lagoons poured into my glass, in the glasses themselves sometimes. First time it happened I damn near threw my drink across the room. *It*, grinning up at me, warped and twisted in the rippling liquid. He’s always fucking smiling you know?

Now, I was understandably a little spooked. Who wouldn’t be? My reflection was another version of me! That had been my running theory, that it was all some parallel universe bullshit – that or it was all some adeptly executed practical joke. Ever since the crash, since I’d seen him in the bathroom and the rear-view mirror, he’d been EVERYWHERE. If there was a reflective surface, he was grinning at me. Mirrors, windows, glass, water, polished metal, booze, you bet your ass he was there. It was tolerable, for a time, and I couldn’t exactly raise it to anyone – there ain’t no booze in a mental institute. So, I got on with it. I couldn’t check my hair or make sure there wasn’t a fleck of apple skin in my teeth, but so what? The bastard wasn’t keeping me from my drinking, and as long as he wasn’t, there was no problem whatsoever.

So, a week or two went by, and I was drunk more often than not (the man in the mirror forgotten under a blanket of warm, golden heat! Liquor’s embrace!). Looking back on it, he was getting… closer to the mirror. It was as if each time I saw him, he got a little closer, a little bolder, like when you test a hot bath with your foot (not that I’ve had a nice hot bath for years, oh yes, that would be nice!). The knocking started the day before *it* happened. Soft, tender raps against the glass of the mirror. It was absurd, technically impossible, but what about any of this is possible? I’d stormed into the bathroom of my dinky little apartment, and there he was, tapping his callused knuckles on the clear surface – like one of those vampires in a cheesy flic, pleading for entry. Muttering under my breath, I cursed him, over and over, as I was want to do.

‘Why don’t you just leave me alone? You bastard? You wicked thing? I’ll wipe that smile off your face…’

I felt nice and safe when he was behind the mirror. Can’t say I felt all that good when the mirror shattered in the early morning.

The tumult in the bathroom woke me, and the firm hands on my neck sobered me. He thrust his fists in a tight iron-grip around my throat, squeezing and constricting. I gargled like a clogged drain, face reddening and spittle flying from my agape mouth. A cruel smile widened across his face, showing his pink, fleshy gums. Again and again, he thrust me into the plush of the bed, hands grasping harder and harder. Pounding upon his shoulders, searing pain exploded in my temple, like barbed wire coiled tighter and tighter until the spool was left taut. White froth flew from my chapped lips as he pounded and pounded, he said not a word but his intent was etched on his perfect, plastic face: The fucker wanted to replace me, he wanted to be me, to be a better version of me. Maybe he thought he could saunter back to my ex-wife? A changed man? His grin said it all. Perhaps it would be for the best, that’s what I thought as his knuckles popped, white and exerted. I’d left Charlotte on nasty terms, a bad ordeal, one I put her through and one I’m not proud of – sobered me for a while, before I thought one couldn’t hurt.

(One couldn’t hurt, nor two, or three, or a dozen, or two dozen, or…)

Pangs of guilt. Pangs of regret. Pangs of need. These feelings permeated what I believed to be my final moments. Charlotte was ever so sweet, my high-school sweetheart. We’d gone to prom together, and oh, how lovely she’d looked in that red dress of hers. Then came the college parties and the drinks. Then came university, and the engagement just a year or two after that. Then came marriage. Talk of a house. Talk of kids. Talk of a life together forever and ever, till death do us part. Then came the drink again, to drown my middle-age woes. The bottle didn’t tell the truth. Didn’t need me here or there for this or that. The bottle didn’t nag or moan. The bottle was there; it just was.

But the bottle didn’t love.

That’s what I thought as the man thrust me down, choking and wrenching and smiling. The dim light of the room, peeking through the curtains, a hazy early-morning light, permeated by the sound of the dawn chorus and a man being choked to death. Ugly shadows danced on his handsome complexion, shrouding him in darkness.

(DRINK YOUR MEDICINE!)

(DRINK IT ALL UP!)

(YOU LIKE TO DRINK, DON’T YOU)

His silent face leered at me, disappearing behind the darkness, blotting out my eyesight. A death gargle escaped my lips, slow, croaking, dying.

Then he loosened his grip, his smile growing even wider, splitting his lips. His hand was cold on my hot cheeks, pinching them between his thumb and fingers. A low mutter followed, and I think he said:

“I am you, you are me, you are I and I am we, we are one split in two, to kill me you’ve got to kill you. I suggest you stay in this hovel, or go throw yourself before some bus or from some derelict triple-story building. Whatever it is you intend to do with the rest of your miserable life, stay out of my way. I have been afforded a life you wasted – *I* will not waste it.”

With that, he left, slamming the door on his way out.

It’s been three weeks since he got out, and I haven’t seen him since. I find myself, in all my glory, when I look in the mirror these days. Stayed away from the bar in that time, I’m a clean man, for a while at least. *It* got a chance at *my* life, whatever the fuck *it* is. I’ll get to Charlotte if it hasn’t already. I’ll sort this whole great big mess out, I’ll reform, you know? This whole series of events, the crash, the man in the mirror, the thing in my apartment, it’s given me a new lease on life, a new perspective, it’s dredged up old memories drowned in cheap liquor. When I get to that fucker, wherever he is, I’ll kill him – I’m having to replace my doppelganger! I know he’s gotten to some people already; he’s got my socials and shit – I know that much. Old friends and former enemies are cropping up, acting as if we’re made up and all good, a great big plaster laid on decades of problems – all my fault, to be fair. My boss is acting all funny, asking if I’m doing extra or something, so I know he’s gotten to my job already. All I hope is that I get to Charlotte before he does, to apologise and explain, if she believes me that is.

I’ve gone to a lot of forums in the last few weeks, on Reddit and otherwise. They say this is the place to go. What should I do? what can I do? Has anyone else had doppelgangers in their reflections? This needs to end, he’s already planting seeds, which in time will bear black fruit. Once I’m all sorted, I’ll go for Charlotte and then for *it*! Anyways, you know I’m a mess but wish me some luck would you?
