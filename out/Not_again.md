Hi,   
  So....I've found this subreddit recently, about people that share they life storys and I have read a couple story here myself, which is very very scary.....   
So I thought I would share mine,  
 First thing all, I'm so sorry if you find this not scary enough....i just thought to share it.....things that happens in life..... So it might not as scary as you think.....   
It start in one morning I'm walking to my work place,  
And for you who ask, I'm living in Asian country, Third World country some might say, and yes I born here,  
You see....... in my country, there is a lot of ghost story and when I'm say alots, I mean a LOTS of ghost story, a crying girl in a bridge, a kid ghost that love stealing money, a disable ghost, and some storys that just absurd,   
Beside that the place at right now is a second work place I've work at, and I've been working here for two month,  
I've been moving here for two month,   
When I got this work I'm moving to my room that I rent close to the office,  
My room was in 2 stories building that have open hallway so you can see the street infront, to the left is the second building, and to right is the third, in front is a fence and a gate where the street at,   
In the left and right of the hallway is a stairs, I'm only use right stairs,  
I'm still not to familiar with the streets, the houses and the locals, however I'm enjoying this place, made a couple friends in the building and in the work,   
However thought, this building kinda creepy........ I mean... Idk......   
It has a gloomy vibe to it, well good thing is there's never been a supernatural things happen to me nor anyone living here,   
Other than that everything sail pretty smooth,  
Until that morning that is,  
I still remember it, that morning I woke up, take a bath, grab my clothes (I'm wearing it), wear my shoe, say hi to a couple of neighbors I meet in the hallway, ignore a person in the stairs, out of the gate  walking out I am, usual stuff,   
I live in an ordinary neighborhood, ten minutes from here is a new mall, I work there,   
I pass a couple of houses, a kids walking to school, a person In the stairs, pretty peacefull place I thought, until..... I saw a pink house,   
YES, a pink house,  
A small house with a pink painted wall,  however.......it's wall was deteriorating, the pink color was bleak, grass and trees was growing wildly inside its iron fence,   
A creepy ass pink house,   
Atleast....that's what everyone told me,   
people in the apartment, coworkers, locals I've talk too, everyone say this house was haunted, that something very horrible happen inside that house,  
Alright I think, I didn't care, I did not ask,  
Nobody told me what happens there thought, they seems didn't knew either,   
just another ghost story,  
Yet it always caught my eyes, it's a creepy house, just like my apartment,  
And I have been walking pass that house for two month now, everytimes I walk pass it, I always turn my eyes toward it, to take a glimpse, just a little curiosty,  
It's small iron fence was rusty, the window was tinted black, so dark I couldnt see through it, the yard was small, maybe three meters (for my fellow hamburgers it's about 10ft), it's yard was full of tall grass here and there was a thrash, even there is a big bags of thrash in there,   
Did people throw their thrashes into a haunted house?,   
Brave, I thought,    
In the the left there is a big tree, grow so big it shadow covers the house like a big gloomy cloud, it's so cold below it, kinda nice, not really, that's why this house looks shady and creepy,   
Im fumbling with my thought until I saw something in the tree,   
Something stick out from behind the tree,  
A strand of hairs.......  
A strand of black hairs stick out from behind the tree......   
I stopped, my eyes widen, I guess I'm surprised by it,   
Than the hair move, slowly moves out of tree, a face peeking from it, just a little, just enough I could see its a head of some one, an eyes look to me behind it's hair, my legs feeling weak.....   
A girl?....  
 no...  
a little girl....  
Did some kids playing in haunted house, pretend to be a ghost in this beautiful morning?,  
That right.....i take a deep breath....  
This is a beautifull morning in a middle of neighborhood......  
there is no way a ghost would appears out of nowhere like one of a sock I found this morning,  
Then the little girl pulled her head to hide again, I start to relax just then I realize how stiff my body is,   
This kid must be have a good YouTube channel or she has no friend, well I don't To be one either, weird kid,   
   
Then........ I saw the little girl peeking at me again from behind the tree......  
My eyes open so wide now....  
I gasped a little.....  
She was above me, peeking.....   
She is above me......   
My eyes meets her.......   
I ran.......   
 .......  
.......  
I ran so fast, like a wind, fast......so fast Usain Bolt would adopted me,  
How that kid climb a tree so fast?......  
She did not climb,   
I ran through house after house like a mouse in a labirinth, then out of a neighborhood, a big street,  
Across are a mall, my work place....finally I thought,  
I stopped my feet, walk across the street in safety manner, the guard say something but I just nod my head, go inside, up to the elevator, open the door, insert my card, open the door, I arrive at my office,  
I just came in like a gentlemen I am and sit on my chair  
Everyone looking at me,  
Yeah..... I look like I just saw a ghost,  
 I did......  
i look like I'm taking a bath in sweats, I kinda did.......   
My feet feels jelly and my face pale, the adrenaline just wear off, this is not as bad as my first office,   
Then......Someone grip my shoulder from behind,  
You thought I'm gonna surprised, jump out my seat, no..... I m tired, my tank kinda running low,  
Rotate my chair I look behind me there is not one, four, five?, of my coworker stand around me,   
They ask me what happens to me, why im such a pale sweating jelly,   
Well.....i tell them.....  
I tell them what i saw in there, in that pink house,  
......they laught at me.....  
Well...... What should i expect.....they are joking around tell theirs story about the pink house......the story that theyve heard not seen,   
The story they share doesn't makes me feels better in anyway,   
They all talk lightly, joking, they picking on me, weirdly enough no one seems to accuse me of lying?......  
After their little picnic, they back to their table doing whatever, the boss gonna arrive soon now.....but one person stay,   
Let's call him Bob,   
Bob was a middle age man, nice guy, ordinary guy, nothing special really, but his chlothes was always neat, he said his wife doing it for him,  
Oh and he lives in that neighborhood where the pink house at,   
He stay at my table, sit down at nearby chair....   
I look him in the eyes and asking him,   
"What?.."  
He look me in the eyes, so I look his shiny head, why so shiny I thought to myself,   
He take a deep breath, and ask me,   
Bob: "Are you alright? "  
Me: "not really"   
Bob: "you can call sick right now, I'll tell boss and I will get you home"  
Me: "no.....that.....alright..."  
Pretty tempting I though, I'm not in mood to work, but.......eh I could work, I've been trying to impress the upper management for this 2 months,  
Me: "no, thats not necessary, I'm a bit shocked otherwise I'm good"  
Bob: ...really then?, you could tell if you need anything I could help"  
 Bob said lighly,  
Bob stand up off his seat before I asked him.....  
Me: "you believe my story? "  
Bob laugh, his head are shiny,   
Bob: "I've seen it myself"  
Me: "oh"  
Bob: "it's pretty common, it's a way of saying hi, to a new neighbor"  
Says Bob while walking to his table,   
Free ice creams should be common and not what ever that is,   
The fear has quite wear down, I'm feeling grumpy now, why I'm so unlucky to meet such thing,   
The rest of the day was usual, other than I eat more at lunch than the usual,  
The ghost encounter has been placed in the back of my mind, and I quickly get my self back, what an adaptable individual, I thought praising myself,   
Until afternoon......  
5:00 pm   
I need go to my apartment.......  
I remember what happens this morning, and chose other route to get home, I use a maps in my phone, and get back home safely,  
From now on I will go that route to go to work, it's slightly more far than pink house  route but it can't be more worth it,  
I open the gate,   
There is saw the landlord, the son of the landlord that is, let's call him....john  
John sits in wooden chair and coffee at a table, enjoying the sunset  
"just get back from work I see"  
John said smiling at me,  
Me: "yeah"  
I said tiredly,   
I didn't knew John much, he just managed this apartment in his father behalf, the real landlord and wife was lives in other city than here,   
He cleans, take payments, guarding, maintaining, etc etc, he was just hanging around here and there, not with me thought,  
I'm not too close to John, doesn't mean I have bad relationship with him,  
.....he try to sell drugs to me once thought........  
John: "want some coffee? "  
Me: "no, not really"  
John: "you look tired"  
Me: "yup" I said abruptly before going for the stairs, I am tired  
John eyes lock into me, he was giggling like something funny,  
I did not have shiny head,   
So I just ignore it......drugs bad I thought.....  
Going up the stairs ignores the person in the stairs, I get to my room, my room are in the corner most left,  
it's sometimes tiring to walk across from the right stairs but whatever ......  
Home sweet home!!!   
I smile as I'm opening the door to my room,  
Inside was rather simple, I didnt call it poor, it's a simple room,  
A bed, table, TV, small wardrobe, important thing,  
I immediately turn on the TV, lay on my bed and take a deep breath.......   
This day is kinda rough, but it's under control,  
Unlike my first office really...... .i did not miss that office,

Opening YouTube video to entertain myself on a videos of how machine gun work and how gosee is a superweapon

before I realize I haven't fell asleep.... 

.........

........

 ......

&#x200B;

I'm slowly woken up to strange noise.....

And my room was dark?..........what?
