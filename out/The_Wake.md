Timmy hugged Kayla from behind, wrapping his arms around her waist. "Come on, everyone's probably waiting for us inside," he said as he released her and began walking towards the entrance of the funeral home.

Timmy was in his twenties, with brown hair, blue eyes, and a slim, average height build. Kayla was the same age as him, but much shorter with long brown hair and hazel eyes. They had met in their sophomore year of high school and had been dating ever since. Timmy proposed to her, and they got married a year after graduation. Their life had been perfect so far, thanks to Kayla's determination to wait to have children.

Three days ago their friend Pamela had been in a car accident. She'd been driving home from work after a late night of having to stay over to do paperwork. At an intersection a drunk driver had ran the red light and hit her directly in the driver side door at sixty-five miles per hour. Pamela was rushed to the hospital, but died shortly afterwards.

It was a chilly evening in November. Kayla caught up to Timmy and looped her arm around his. They walked up the stairs together, and he held the door open for her. Upon entering, they noticed their friends Kenny and Silas standing in the reception area. Silas was tall with an average build, black hair, and brown eyes. Kenny was of average height and a bit heavier with brown hair and green eyes.

"Hey, guys." Timmy said. Both Silas and Kenny raised their heads and smiled. "Hey. You two doing alright?" Silas asked. Kayla grabbed Timmy's hand and squeezed tightly. "Yeah..." she replied. "I just can't believe she's gone. I can only imagine how upset Ron is." Silas walked up beside Kenny and put his hand on his shoulder. "I haven't seen him yet. Kenny called him earlier to see if he needed a ride." Silas said, as Kenny suddenly had a grim look on his face. "He said he was alright," Kenny spoke up, "but didn't sound like he was taking it very well. He said he would be here, though."

Timmy looked around at the rest of the people in the room. He didn't recognize anyone. His eyes stopped at the corner near the entrance to the bathrooms. A small child was standing there staring at him, a little girl. She looked to be about five or six years old, and was wearing an old ragged dress that was torn in areas.

Suddenly the main door opened, and a tall man walked inside. He had blonde hair and blue eyes, and looked like he never missed a day at the gym. "Hey, Ron. How you holding up?" Kayla asked the man. Ron walked up beside them and put his hands in his pockets. "I'm alright." He said. Kayla reached out and hugged him. "Come on, let's go say our goodbyes."

Everyone knew that Ron had the biggest crush on Pamela. He was normally rough around the edges and played mister tough guy, but as soon as Pam entered the room he'd turn as soft as a pillow.

Pamela appeared peaceful in her casket. The dimly lit room matched the scene perfectly, and the coffin spray was a beautiful mix of red, yellow, and orange.

Kenny approached Ron, who looked on the verge of tears, and placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. Ron just stood there with his hands in his pockets, staring at Pamela's lifeless body. Silas leaned in closely to whisper in Timmy's ear. "Have you noticed that most of her family has left already? It's only been about thirty minutes." Timmy shifted his weight and nodded in agreement. "You're right, that is pretty strange."

Timmy's gaze darted around the room until it landed on a little boy standing in the corner, just past the door. The boy was dressed in a torn dark shirt and pants so filthy that it was difficult to determine their color, let alone if they were blue jeans. "Hey," Timmy said, pointing towards the corner. "Do you see that kid over there?" Silas turned to look, but he didn't see anything. The boy was gone. "Where? I don't see anything."

Timmy had looked away to try and get Kayla's attention. When he turned his gaze back to the corner, he noticed the boy was missing. "He...where did he go? He was just there a second ago." He looked around the room, but there was no sign of the boy anywhere. Silas frowned. "Are you okay, man?" he asked. Timmy let out a sigh. "I guess. I'm gonna go downstairs and get a water." He walked over to Kayla. "Hey, I'm gonna go get something to drink. Do you want anything?" he asked. "I'm fine for now, thanks, babe." She gave him a quick kiss.

Timmy walked down the ramp to the downstairs lounge area and was surprised to find that the room was empty. He walked over to the vending machine and inserted a dollar bill to purchase a can of coke. As he bent down to pick up the can, he noticed a movement in his peripheral vision. Turning his head, he saw a little girl by the door that led to the back entrance. She was different from the girl he had seen earlier, a year or so younger, and was holding her arms tightly around her body.

Timmy greeted the girl, but she didn't respond and just stared at him. He then noticed a strange black mark on her arm as he asked if she was okay and if she knew where her parents were. The girl turned and limped away from him through the doorway, and Timmy followed her. As he passed through the doorway and turned right, a door down the hall slammed shut, revealing the label "Morgue" above it. Feeling confused and uneasy, Timmy approached the door and slowly opened it. It creaked as he stepped inside and descended the stairs.

Silas turned to face Kayla. "Something doesn't seem right. Where is everyone?" Kayla shrugged. "I dunno. I was thinking the same thing. Maybe they are all in the reception area?" "Yeah, maybe." Silas nodded. He turned and started walking towards the door, but stopped. In front of the door were four children, three boys and one girl. Each of them had their heads facing the ground. "Umm... Kayla, are you seeing this?" Silas stammered. Kayla approached him with slow steps. "Hey," she said, "are you kids..." As Kayla stood next to Silas, they saw the children suddenly raise their hands and start pointing at them. The children's movements seemed mechanical, almost like puppets. Ron turned his head to see what was happening. "Whats with all the kids?" He said, wiping his eyes.

The group was startled as the children began to approach them in a strange, jerky way, still pointing their fingers towards them. "Oh hell no," Silas exclaimed, turning and rushing towards the other door in the room which was fortunately closer. Ron and Kayla quickly followed him, urging Kenny to hurry up. However, Kenny tripped over a chair and fell to the ground, grunting as he tried to crawl towards the doorway. Kayla turned around and saw that the children were now in the middle of the room. Their mouths were open impossibly wide, stretching down so far that the skin between their lips was splitting. Their eyes were solid black and they had black veins running through their faces. She saw one of the children grab Kenny's foot as he was crawling towards the doorway. "Kenny!" She shouted.

Kenny rolled over onto his back and found himself staring into the most terrifying eyes he had ever seen. The child's eyes were completely black and empty, and Kenny felt paralyzed with fear. He desperately tried to move and kick at the child, but he couldn't even budge. He stared into the endless voids that were the child's eyes, and suddenly, a mixture of dread and comfort overwhelmed him. It was the most terrible and yet comforting feeling he had ever experienced. He felt his consciousness slipping away, as if his soul was being sucked into the child's eyes.

The children were surrounding Kenny. They were all reaching their arms out for him, inches from his face. Kayla watched as Ron and Silas ran back into the room, yelling at Kenny and the children. Just as they reached Kenny, however, three of the children snapped their heads towards them, extending their hands. Silas and Ron were both blasted out of the room by an unseen force and tumbled into the reception area. Kayla let out a loud scream as she jumped out of the way, barely missing Ron who was flying towards her. She quickly rushed to the door, but it slammed shut right before her. "I can't open it!" she yelled while shaking the door handle frantically. Ron and Silas groaned as they struggled to get up from the floor. Ron then rushed to Kayla's side and began forcefully pushing against the door with his shoulder. "I'll try the other door!" Silas yelled as he ran to the other side of the room. But to his surprise, that door was also locked. "What the hell?" he exclaimed in frustration.

Ron stopped trying to break the door and put his ear against it. He could hear what he assumed to be Kenny making gurgling sounds for a few seconds, and then everything went silent. After a few moments of silence, Ron straightened up and stepped away from the door. "What the hell just happened?" he asked. Silas started walking towards Kayla and Ron. As soon as he approached the door, there was a clicking sound and the door cracked open. Kayla moved closer to Silas as Ron picked up a vase from a nearby table. "Ron, please be careful," she warned him as he peeked through the door.

"What the..." Ron started, before opening the door fully. "Where did they go?" Silas approached the doorway and looked inside. "Kenny? Kenny, are you in there?" He walked into the room to where Kenny had been just moments ago. There was now a large black stain on the red carpet where Kenny had been. "Where did he go?" Silas asked, moving closer to examine the stain. Kayla and Ron entered the room and stood next to Silas. "What is that?" Kayla asked. Ron knelt down and examined the stain. "This doesn't make any sense..." he said. Silas walked back to the doorway. "Let's find Timmy and get out of here," he said, stepping out of the room.

Kayla and Ron exited the doorway and walked down the hall to the reception desk. "Hello?" Kayla called out. "Is anyone here?" Ron tried the door handle to the reception office, but the knob wouldn't turn. "It's locked," he scoffed. Kayla took out her phone and dialed Timmy's number. Meanwhile, Silas walked to the top of the ramp and looked down. "I don't see or hear him." He said. Kayla suddenly shot her head forwards. "Timmy, where are you? Something happened to Kenny!" Ron, who was nearby, walked over to her and leaned against the reception counter. Kayla looked at her phone screen, then held it back to her ear. "Timmy? Timmy? Hello?" Ron raised an eyebrow. "Well, where is he?" Kayla, confused, looked down at her phone as she replied. "He followed a kid into the morgue because she looked hurt. But then the call got disconnected. I tried calling him back, but my phone suddenly has no service." Silas and Ron both took out their phones from their pockets and checked them. "I don't have service either," Ron said. "Neither do I," Silas confirmed.

Suddenly, a popping sound caught Kayla's attention, and she turned around to see the main entrance doors. There stood a group of puppet-like children, all with their heads facing down towards the floor. Kayla let out a loud scream, and she bumped into Silas, who started backing away towards the ramp leading to the downstairs area. "I think we should find Timmy and get out of here," Silas said softly. The three of them started moving quickly down the ramp, then hurried to the downstairs lounge area and shut the door behind them.

"I think the door to the morgue is down the hallway." Silas said, looking into the hall. "Yeah, there it is." He stepped into the hallway and started walking towards the door, Kayla and Ron following close behind.

"Why do I have a bad feeling about this?" Ron spoke up. Silas looked at the door to the morgue and opened it, peeking inside. "Yeah, me too. Come on." They walked through the doorway and down the stairs. The stench of formaldehyde filling their noses made Kayla gag a little. "Oh my god... that smells terrible," she said. As they reached the bottom of the stairs, there was a door that was slightly ajar in front of them. The sound of metal clinking and the noise of something that resembles cutting open an envelope caught their attention. Silas was the first to reach the door, and he slowly opened it.

As they entered the room, they saw that it was the preparation area for the mortician. A man was standing beside a gurney, dressed in black pants, a black vest, and a white shirt. His hair, as well as his skin, was ghostly white. When he turned to face them, they couldn't help but notice how old and withered he looked. His face was wrinkled and shriveled, and his eyes had no iris, but were sunken deep into the sockets. He looked more like a corpse than a human being.

Despite his eerie appearance, the man smiled at them, revealing a mouth full of crooked teeth. As he stepped aside, the group noticed what he had been doing. Kayla put her hands to her mouth and shrieked. On the gurney was Timmy. His arms and legs were restrained, and his mouth had been gagged. He had a large tube stuck in the side of his neck, which was trickling blood as he looked at the group with wide, begging eyes.

"Timmy!" Kayla shouted. The old man walked to a machine and flipped a switch. The whole room erupted in an ear splitting noise as the embalming machine roared to life. Timmy struggled and gurgled as the blood was pumped from his body and replaced with embalming solution. He flailed for a bit, then remained still, dead in a matter of seconds. His blood poured down the gurney and through the drain in the floor.

Kayla screamed again, then turned to the side and vomited on the floor. Silas started running for Timmy as Ron began angrily walking towards the old man, but before anything else could happen, the lights in the room went out. The embalming machine whirred to a halt, leaving behind an eerie silence.

Suddenly the lights came on again, and the only sound was the echoing drips of fluids and blood. "Omg, Timmy!" Kayla cried as she walked quickly to the gurney. "He's dead!" Both Silas and Ron walked up beside her. "What a sick bastard!" Ron exclaimed, shaking with rage. Kayla tried to control her crying, but she couldn't. She had just witnessed the love of her life suffer a horrible death in front of her. "How could he..." she choked. "Timmy's gone..." Silas placed his hands on Kayla's shoulders and spoke with urgency. "Kayla, we cannot stay here. We need to contact the police and find a way to escape." He took out his phone, but there was still no signal. Silas looked around the room and noticed a phone on the desk in the corner. He walked over to it, picked it up, and tried to make a call. But the line was dead, and there was no response from the other end.

"Dammit!" Silas shouted, and angrily knocked everything from the desk, causing objects to clatter to the floor. As he surveyed the mess, his eyes settled on a piece of paper that stood out from the rest. He knelt down and picked it up, scanning it. It appeared to be a copy of an old newspaper clipping from 1903. "Look at this..." He said. "It says here that this funeral home was built in the late 1800's. The owner of the funeral home was a man named Walter Higgins, who was accused of kidnapping adults and children and keeping them in the basement. He was investigated, but ultimately found innocent in court due to law enforcement not being able to find any evidence against him. Apparently the townsfolk didn't like that outcome, so they hunted him down in his home and killed him."

Ron marched over to Silas with a stern expression on his face. "This is not the time to be reading bullshit, dumbass," he said, his voice laced with anger. Meanwhile, Kayla wiped away her tears and gazed at Silas with a perplexed look on her face. "What does that have to do with anything?" she asked. Silas pointed at a small picture on the paper. "Look at this picture, it's the same guy we just saw," he said. Ron narrowed his eyes and studied the picture closely. "That doesn't make any sense," he said. Kayla wiped her eyes and nose on her shirt. "You said that the article is from 1903, right? The man would have to be a hundred and thirty years old at least. And you said that the townsfolk killed him." Silas shook his head. "I know, and in this picture he already looks like he's at least seventy. It doesn't make any sense, but come on. Does anything we've seen tonight make sense?" He placed the paper on the desk and turned towards Ron, who was rubbing the back of his neck.

"Honestly, I don't care," Ron said as he walked towards the door that led to the stairs and tried to open it, but it wouldn't budge. He started banging his shoulder against the door loudly. Kayla stood up and confronted him. "Please stop! It won't do any good, and you're making a lot of noise," she said sternly.

Ron scoffed and turned around, heading towards the double metal doors with windows on the other side of the room. Silas scanned the room and approached a shelf stocked with various chemicals and supplies. He opened the cabinet and retrieved a long white sheet, then proceeded to drape it over the motionless body of Timmy. Silas noticed Kayla whimpering and immediately went to comfort her with a hug. After releasing her, he turned to Ron, who was peering through the double doors' windows. Ron noted that it was a hallway that seemed to lead to the morgue, but quite dark. Silas began searching through the drawers, hoping to find a key or anything that could open the doors.

Kayla, still shaken, sat down in a chair at the corner, her face buried in her hands. While Silas continued his search, Ron pushed on the double doors, which opened without any difficulty. "I'll go check out what's inside," Ron said. "Let me know if you find anything." Silas nodded, still rummaging through the drawers. He found a flashlight and put it in his pocket, reminding Ron to be careful.

Ron entered the long hallway, a nervous feeling in his gut. The lights flickered as he made his way towards the double doors that led to the morgue. He stopped and peeked through the windows, noticing that the morgue was dimly lit with a flickering light that looked like it could go out at any moment.

He pushed the doors open and stepped into the morgue, the doors shutting behind him. The only sound was the hum of the cooling system. As he scanned the room, he approached one of the cold cabinets and opened it. Suddenly, a small arm emerged from the cabinet and gripped his arm, trying to pull him inside. "Get off me!" He grunted, grabbing the arm and trying to pull its grip loose. He hammer fisted the arm and hand to no avail, and it only seemed to make the arm stronger. He realized that he was losing the struggle and it filled him with dread. He used his other hand to grab the side of the cold cabinet but two additional arms emerged from the darkness and covered his face. He tried to scream, but it was muffled as he was pulled into the freezer. The door shut behind him, engulfing him in darkness.

Meanwhile in the other room, Silas was in the supply cabinet, tossing medical supplies and chemical bottles aside. After moving a few bottles, he found a small red switch. "Hey, I think I found something," he called out to Kayla. She walked over to him and they flipped the switch together.

Suddenly, the wall on their left started sliding, revealing a hidden door. "Well, that's interesting," Silas said as he tested the knob and opened the door. Inside, a long dark tunnel stretched out before them. There were no lights in the tunnel, and they couldn't see the end of it. "Let's go get Ron," Silas suggested, but something caught his attention. He glanced towards the door that led to the stairs, where he saw the old man with a crooked grin on his face. Standing around him were at least ten children, all of them pointing their fingers at Silas and Kayla.

As the children slowly walked towards them in their jerky movements, Kayla let out a loud shriek. Silas quickly grabbed her and pulled her into the tunnel, shutting the door and locking it behind them. "I doubt that will keep them out." Kayla whispered, her voice trembling with fear. Silas looked at her solemnly. "You're probably right." Kayla's eyes widened with concern. "What about Ron?" Silas shrugged helplessly as a sudden hammering at the door made them both jump.

Silas yanked the flashlight from his pocket and flipped it on, shining it down the tunnel. "Come on!" He told Kayla, grabbing her arm and starting to run. Both of them ran down the tunnel, trying not to trip over loose rocks and gravel. The light from the flashlight revealed an end to the tunnel ahead, and they hurried until they reached the end of it. The hammering on the door had stopped. Silas shone his flashlight around. To the left, the tunnel continued until what he assumed was another turn. To the right, a metal door stood. Kayla approached the door and opened it. Inside was a small room. As they entered the room, Kayla and Silas were greeted with a ghastly sight. The floor was covered in bloodstains and bones, some of which had chains wrapped around them. A large spider was crawling across the floor. Kayla turned to Silas and whispered, "I think this might be where he kept the children." Silas nodded in agreement, as Kayla shut the door and they started walking down the tunnel again.

The pair made their way through the dark tunnel, and soon reached a turn that only led to the right. A wooden door was visible in the distance, about a hundred feet away. As they walked towards it, Kayla walked straight into a giant cobweb, causing her to let out a loud screech. She frantically started slapping her hair and face, trying to remove the sticky web. "Get it off!" Kayla yelled as Silas quickly rushed over to help, slapping the spider out of her hair, which hit the floor with a thud and ran into the shadows. "Oh my God, I want out of here!" she said, her voice full of panic. Silas walked over to the door and opened it. The door led to a flight of stairs that went upwards. At the top of the stairs, there was a cellar door. Silas approached the doorway, but was interrupted by a shrill scream. He quickly turned around to see an old man with his hand over Kayla's mouth.

Before Silas could react, the old man pulled out a scalpel and dug it into Kaylas neck as she squealed. The man's grin turned into a frown as he drug the scalpel from one end of Kaylas neck to the other. Kayla gurgled and flailed as blood sprayed everywhere. She reached out an arm towards Silas, a desperate plea for help, then fell limp in the man's arms.

Silas threw the flashlight at the man, which missed wildly as Kayla's body slumped to the floor. Silas went to turn and run through the doorway, but an unseen force was suddenly holding him still. He looked to the left of the man, and there was a little girl standing over Kayla's body, holding her hand out towards him. Silas was overcome by a dizzying sensation as he looked into the child's dark, void-like eyes. Suddenly, he heard a gasp and snapped out of his trance. Kayla, who had been lying unconscious, was now on her side holding a large rock. She threw the rock at the little girl, and the stone struck the child in the side of the head. Silas realized he was no longer under the girl's spell and ran out of the room, slamming the door behind him as he heard a splattering sound. He sprinted up the stairs and burst through the cellar door to escape.

Silas found himself in the midst of a dense forest. His heart was racing as he slammed the door shut behind him, the full moon illuminating the surroundings with an eerie glow, and he didn't recognize where he was. He turned around to start walking, but a sudden wave of dizziness hit him, causing him to lose his balance and tumble onto the ground. As he struggled to catch his breath, he noticed a small black mark on his left forearm, which reminded him of the sinister black veins on the faces of the children. Shaken but determined, he picked himself up and headed in the direction of what he hoped would be the safety of town.

Silas finally reached the city and went straight to the police station. He provided his statement, and the police searched the funeral home. However, after a long morning of searching, they couldn't find anything at all. Eventually, the police offered him a ride back home, as they didn't believe his story. They questioned him about being on drugs or drinking the night before, assuming he had passed out from drinking his depression away.

Silas stumbled into the house and collapsed onto his bed, his head throbbing with a fierce ache. The black mark on his forearm had grown, pulsing with an ominous beat. Exhaustion enveloped him, and he couldn't resist the temptation of slumber any longer. He closed his eyes and surrendered to the darkness.

The smell of mildew and stale air jolted Silas awake. He rubbed his bleary eyes and sat up, his heart racing with a mix of fear and anticipation as he realized where he was, immediately recognizing the room with bones and chains. He looked down at his leg and noticed that there was a chain around it, attached to the wall. However, something seemed off. Why was his leg so small? He held out his hands and realized they were much smaller than they should have been, almost as small as they were when he was about six years old. Silas turned to see a little girl in the opposite corner of the room, also with a chain attached to her leg. But why did she look so familiar? The brown hair and hazel eyes...

Suddenly the door opened and Silas had to shield his eyes from the light. As his vision adjusted, he recognized the person who had walked into the room. The old man's smile stretched from ear to ear, and Silas felt his world go black.
