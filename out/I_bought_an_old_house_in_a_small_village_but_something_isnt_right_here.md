**Day 1**

I finally moved in today.  
The house stands on the edge of the village — a little isolated, but not completely alone. It was badly damaged in a fire years ago, and I got it cheap. For weeks, I’ve been renovating: painting walls, laying floors, sealing the roof. Now it smells of fresh paint, though in some corners you can still sense the old smoke — like the house remembers the fire.

The neighbors were surprisingly friendly. An older lady showed me the way to the bakery. A man helped carry my toolbox. Kids watched curiously from behind a fence. None of them seemed strange — quite the opposite. It feels peaceful here.  
Maybe this is exactly what I needed.

In the evening, I made a pizza, put my feet up, and just enjoyed the silence. No cars, no sirens, no city noise. Just the creaking of old beams and the wind whispering through the roof.  
I think I’m going to like it here.

**Day 2**

Today I explored the village. A small marketplace, a bakery, a tiny bar, a hairdresser. Everything looks old-fashioned but alive.  
People greet each other, nod, make small talk. It’s almost idyllic — too idyllic.

When I got back, I decided to check out the attic.  
That’s when I noticed a small hatch I hadn’t seen before. It was hidden behind a beam, as if someone had built around it on purpose. I grabbed the ladder and climbed up. The room was small and dusty, filled with boxes and cobwebs. Among the clutter, I found a wooden chest containing several VHS tapes.

The labels read: *“Village Fair 1990,” “Harvest Festival 1991,” “Christmas 1993.”*  
Nothing unusual.

I brought them downstairs and placed them next to my TV.  
Part of me was curious — another part felt… uneasy.  
I mean, who leaves something like this behind?

**Day 3**

I couldn’t resist. Tonight, I watched the first tape — *“Village Fair 1990.”*  
The image was grainy, the sound rough, but still clear enough. People laughed, danced, ate cake. Kids ran around the park. Everything looked harmless, normal. I kept wondering why someone would save this.

Then — a knock at the door.  
I jumped so hard I almost knocked the recorder over.

Outside stood an older woman — gray hair, glasses, sharp eyes. She smiled politely.  
“Everything alright?” she asked.  
I nodded, still tense. “Yeah, all good. You just startled me.”  
She smiled kindly. “Oh! I’m so sorry if I scared you. I just wanted to introduce myself — I’m Mrs. Miller, I live right across the street.”

Then she smiled again and left.

**Day 4**

I work from home — marketing, nothing exciting. The day went smoothly.  
In the evening, I picked up the tapes again. This time: *“Harvest Festival 1991.”*

Same village, same faces, same camera angle. But something felt off.  
No one smiled. They looked normal… but empty.  
They stood there, motionless for minutes at a time, as if the whole thing was staged.

I turned the tape off and tried to get some work done.  
It was late — around 2:30 AM — when I finally stood up to turn out the lights.

That’s when I noticed movement outside.

I pulled the curtain aside just a little.  
In the yards of my neighbors stood people. All of them. Men, women, children.  
They weren’t looking at me — they were looking up at the sky.

No sound. No movement. Just stillness.

I froze, heart pounding. After a few minutes, I went back to bed.  
I told myself I must be dreaming. It had to be a dream.

**Day 5**

This morning, I feel like an idiot.  
I must’ve dreamt it, right? Who stands outside at three in the morning staring at the sky?

I worked all morning, answering emails, keeping busy.  
Outside, everything looked normal. The neighbors waved, the kids played.  
I told myself I’d just imagined it.

Still… something lingers.  
That feeling of being watched.  
Every time I look out the window, I see the same faces — and I swear they hold my gaze a second too long.

**Day 6**

I couldn’t keep quiet anymore.  
This afternoon, I went to see Mrs. Miller.

She let me in without asking why. Her house smelled of herbal tea and old wood.  
I told her what I’d seen — the people outside, the sky, the silence.

She listened carefully, then sighed.  
“You shouldn’t have bought that house,” she said softly.

I asked what she meant.

Then she told me the story.

Years ago, when she was a child, it all began.  
The villagers believed that by watching the sky together, they could connect with a higher power.  
They called it *“The Night of the Gaze.”*  
No one was allowed to sleep. No one could look away.  
Once a month, everyone stood outside — all at the same time.

But one man refused.  
The man who lived in my house before me.  
He mocked them, called them crazy.

A few days later, the house burned down.  
They never found his body.

Mrs. Miller looked at me, her voice trembling.  
“I don’t believe in it either,” she said.

I asked her why she was still alive if she didn’t take part.

“I still go outside,” she whispered, “but not completely. I stay in the shadows, until they all start looking up. Then I disappear before anyone notices I’m gone.”  
She paused. “You mustn’t stand out. Not here.”

Her hand rested briefly on my shoulder.  
“If they think you’re him… run. But quietly.”

I didn’t know what to say.  
I just left.

**Day 7**

Since that talk, things feel different.  
People are colder now. Some don’t smile back.  
One man even crossed the street when he saw me.

Mrs. Miller told me not to mention anything to anyone.  
But I can feel their eyes on me.  
Sometimes, I catch them staring from their windows — not angry, not curious… just *measuring*.  
Like hunters deciding if I’m worth the effort.

I pretend not to notice.  
But they know that I know.

**Day 8**

Today, I went to the town hall to look up records about my property.  
The woman at the front desk was friendly — until she heard the address.  
Then she went quiet and said, “There are no complete files for that lot.”

I asked what happened to the previous owner.  
She avoided my eyes.

I searched online later.  
Nothing concrete — except a few old forum posts.  
They all said the same thing: arson.

No body. No trace. No proof he ever left the village.

When I looked out the window, Mrs. Miller was across the street.  
She was watching me with a worried expression — almost fear.  
Then she closed her curtains.

I think she knows what’s coming.

**Day 9**

It’s 2:58 AM.  
I’m sitting at my desk, writing this with shaking hands.  
There are footsteps outside. Many. Slow. Even.  
I know what that means.

I stand and go to the window.  
They’re all there. Every single one of them.  
All the villagers, crowded into my yard, their faces blank.

This time, they’re not looking at the sky.  
They’re looking straight at me.

Across the street, Mrs. Miller stands by her window.  
She looks terrified. She’s shaking her head, mouthing something I can’t hear.  
Then her lights go out.

Someone knocks at my door.  
Softly at first. Then harder.

Now I hear the handle move.

I have to go.  
I can’t be the next one they “forget.”

But they’re already at the door.  
I hear the wood creak.  
I hear their voices — whispering, calm, almost *ritualistic.*

I have to run. Through the back yard — it’s my only way out.  
I just hope they don’t catch me....
