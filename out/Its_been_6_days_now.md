In order for anyone to understand why I am beyond disturbed I have to start back at the beginning.  Back when 2012 I was 12 years old and I have met my first best friend! Angel, her and I went on and became very close. During our young years I would spend a lot of time over at her house and there was her mother, step father, and Jordan her baby sister.  We all have became very close in such a sort period of time, nothing could get between us! Both of our families grew up in small towns. Mine was slightly bigger and had a few more things to do. But the town they grew up in only has two stop lights and a handful of businesses.

As time went on and we grew up into adults we haven’t really seen each other in a long time. Honestly it is quite over due. However Angel and I still talk to this day. Throughout the years life has certainly done some things to us. But we never let it get in between us. 

Jordan and Angel have both grown into beautiful young ladies. Angel went on to get married had a few children and battled a lot with drugs and alcohol as life went on, Jordan however graduated from high school got a job at a local gas station in the small town the she grew up in, graduated in, had had her entire life in. Jordans in the process of owning her very own home. Definitely something to be proud of. 

Okay now we will jump to present time. It’s the morning of December 4th 2023, I get my cup of coffee hop on Facebook and there it is, the beginning of an endless nightmare! I cannot believe that I am ready that there is a missing person in the town next to my hometown where I did alot of my very own firsts, graduated, first job. Close to home, way to close! Jordan has gone missing! I am in shock as I immediately get on messenger and get a hold of Angel and she confirms. One of my biggest fears has been unlocked! 

Now I live far away now and cannot get to the town. Everyday I go to Jordan’s facebook just hoping I would read “Jordan’s home!”. Days go by and then before we know it, it’s Christmas. Christmas just isn’t the same anymore and will never be the same again. Friday while I was at work just puttering along, also I felt extremely sick too this day, I went to grab some cold air and check my phone any typical thing. And there it was my reason for feeling like I’m going to get sick. Missing girl found dead! I have not slept no more than maybe 6 hours in the past 6 days! I cannot close my eyes because every time I do I see Jordan like I was the one who found her and it send chills down my spine I feel sick still today probably from lack of sleep, I just want to sleep but I am too afraid too. My nerves cannot handle it I am so shaken to the core.
