I live in Texas i often go out if that’s to a friends, a club or simply walks i’m never home, i have sever insomnia, just about every night more often then not i have plans the rest of the time i just wonder around walking till I get tired.

I live in a rural area so there isn’t much going on, its often quite with little light other then street lights, a few nights ago id just left my friends house and decided to walk around, nothing out of the ordinary, except this night I could feel something.

I had that overwhelming feeling i was being watched, I thought id just been overthinking maybe i was tired but this felt different, I decided to walk home and the feeling soon faded. 

Last night after eventually shaking the feeling of dread, I decided to yet once again go for a night walk after hours of no sleep, id been walking for about 30 minutes at this point and i felt that same feeling except this time id gotten chills like someone was breathing on my neck, i was reluctant to look but i did, there was nothing.

I started to walk faster, i soon after saw someone on the other side of the street which is rare here, they were walking in my direction, i couldn’t make out what they looked like but something about them seemed off physically, they were very tall and slender but hunched over like they were hurt.

All of the street lights around us cut out, i could hear rustling in the tree line on the other side of street, i ran as fast as i think i ever have using nothing more then the lights in the distance as my guide, i could feel it behind me, following me, my friend Rachels house was close so i ran there and began to ring her doorbell.

She let me in asking me what had happed, i had tears in my eyes from the cold air burning them from running, i told her what had happened and she blew it off as nothing more then me being scared and paranoid which wasn’t normal considering shes a big believer in these things, I could understand her thinking i was crazy but I couldn’t shake what happened, some time passed and we stared a movie, at this point it was apparent something was off.

She wasn’t speaking to me just about at all and was sitting away from me which is far from normal with us, i told her i was going to the restroom, shortly after i get in there i receive a text from Rachel, she had asked me if i was at her house, her ring camera showed a notification and she checked the footage seeing me, i responded confused considering she was the one who let me in, she told me she wasn’t home, she was with her boyfriend, i began to panic.

I told her there was someone here who looked like her and explained what happened, she told me she would be right over and told me to stay there till she was home, i figure she thought i was being crazy but she seemed serious.

I eventually got another text when she was here telling me to stay in the bathroom, and not too long after there was muffled talking which turned to yelling, banging and eventually silence.

I’ve been in here for hours now, with my self locked in the bathroom, it has been knocking at the door calling my name, the knocking has stopped but i can see the shadow from under the door, it hasn’t moved and neither have i.

At this point I’m sitting here just waiting for something to happen, i cant call anyone and risk putting others in danger and some may just think I’m crazy, my stomach burns from hunger and I’m far from prepared for whats next, I’m stuck waiting to die or fight my way out.
