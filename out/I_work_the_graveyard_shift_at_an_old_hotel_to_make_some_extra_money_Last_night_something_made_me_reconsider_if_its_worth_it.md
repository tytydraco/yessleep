Let me preface this by saying that I am by no means a believer in the occult or the mystics. I’d like to believe that I am of a sound mind and to an extent see myself as more rational and logical than of a particular creative stature. 

I work at an old, historic hotel in a large Danish city. It’s by no means ancient. It was built in the 19th century and is only historic because of its old age and because it was used by the Nazis as headquarters during the 1940s occupation. It is a nice hotel though and I do enjoy working here. It is beautiful in a very luxurious 1950s way and goes a long way to give off that vibe.

I only work every second weekend, and the graveyard shift allows me to focus on my studies while getting paid to do so. The job is pretty straightforward: Man the reception for 10-12 hours, welcome guests, perform light administrative tasks, open and close doors for late-night arrivals, and once every night I tour the grounds. As I said – straightforward. 

Of course.. Every now and again you get the annoying drunkard spewing their intoxicated ramblings, the aftermath of futile attempts from couples trying to salvage their marriages, strange requests, and odd guests. 

Nothing extremely unusual or terrifying. I don’t think I have ever felt scared or creeped out. I once got super stressed when there was a local power outage and emergency protocols kicked in, but as a Danish saying goes – you gotta take the sour with the sweet. I am certain there’s a fitting English expression, but that’s not my strong suit. 

Last night, however, something made me reconsider. I am left grappling with the unnerving possibility that my once-sound mind may be faltering or that the world of the occult may be more real than I ever dared to believe. And I’m not sure which is worse.

I feel like I must make something clear before I proceed. I don’t like leading people on. I am writing this to get advice, clear my mind and make sense of my experience. There won’t be a huge crescendo at the end of this. Nothing like that happened, it is more the accumulated collection of WTF-moments and the unsettling feeling that something far more sinister is looming – either perceived or very real. 

Last night began like any other. With just one more guest to check in before the clock struck midnight, I looked forward to a quiet evening of studying. Thanks to a national holiday, our bar and restaurant were closed. It felt as though the entire hotel was fast asleep even though occupancy was at 91%. This was great because it meant more time for my studies and with exams looming, it was almost perfect. 

By midnight people had emerged and the younger crowd went to the city, and I was almost done with all the administrative work, which meant 8 hours of studies ahead. Finally settled with my laptop, I opened Visual Studio and began typing when the phone rang... Typical. 

I launched into my standard greeting, but before I could finish, the voice on the other end interrupted me. 

It was a rough and hoarse voice that met me. It was as though the sound of stones cracking had found a voice of its own, but whatever was said was unintelligible to me. I said something along the lines of connection issues, but again before I could finish, I was cut off. But not by that – voice. 

Instead, the most enchanting, velvety female voice came back to me in perfect Danish. But not modern Danish. It was old. Speaking in an antiquated Danish dialect, reminiscent of 1920s radio broadcasts, asking if I could come and help with the heat, as it was unbearably, freezing cold in the room. Mesmerized, I answered that I’d be right on my way. I felt drawn to the voice, and honestly, I wanted to see whatever beauty inhabited that voice. Surely, she had to be like an angel. Angelic is perhaps the most fitting word to describe that voice. It made me forget all about the devilish counterpart, which had initially met me. 

Now, I would’ve rushed to the room. I actually did but was caught on the stairs. The doorbell rang, and I had to open. I let the guy in and went back to my desk. I usually wait until whoever I let in disappears into the elevator.

He took forever.. This drunken idiot couldn’t have walked slower even if he tried. It was only during this agonizing wait that I realized the room number the beautiful voice had given me—413—didn't exist. 

There were only twelve rooms on the fourth floor. I can’t explain why, but a wave of embarrassment and disappointment washed over me as if I had let down someone truly important. I was determined to find her and make it right. 

Since room 313 was vacant, I deduced that she must be in room 213. Sure enough, the name "Cecilia" appeared on my screen. Great. Amazing. Off I went. Off to help Cecilia. Angel-Cecilia. All jolly and with an extra blanket and an electrical heater in my hand. 

I turned the corner and saw 213. I knocked on the door.

As the door turned something hit me like a wall. I don’t have the words to describe it. The stench. It was like nothing I’ve ever felt like before. It had a certain strength to it. Like when you enter a sauna. Instead of heat, it was a wall of smell. Raw meat. My stomach instantly turned. And Cecilia or whatever that woman was, was far from angelic. 

She wasn’t necessarily ugly, but just ordinary. Or resembling a picture come to life. Or something else. Like an AI had created her and she just kinda spawned into the world. Very uncanny valley. She didn’t say anything. Just motioned me to come inside. Every fiber of my being resisted, but I had to. 

I walked through that thick wall, and she closed the door behind me. I suddenly became very alert. My mind instantly turned on fight or flight mode. The room was fine for me. At least heat-wise. Maybe even a bit too hot. And I said so. Very fast. I didn’t look at her. I just went back towards the door again. I put the blanket and electrical heater on the floor and muttered some excuse and fled. 

I practically sprinted down to the reception, through the lobby and straight outside into the fresh air. I don’t know for how long I stood there, but I didn’t return inside until another guest arrived. 

I sat down by the computer again. And decided to research. I put in 213 and found Cecilia. I looked at the booking and saw a note from my colleague: “Guest checked out 19:47 – work thing”. My entire body froze. 

Whoever occupied that room was not the Cecilia who had made the reservation.

Under normal circumstances, I would have headed straight to the room or called security, but this time, I hesitated. I didn't want to be scolded by security for not handling the situation myself, nor did I want to face whatever was in that room alone. Admittedly, it was selfish, but at that moment, all I could think was: "This is a job for housekeeping, not me."

For the next hour, I remained rooted to my seat at the desk, unable to muster the courage to do anything else. I was genuinely terrified. And I know you might think it seems stupid or irresponsible, but there was something in that room, something with “Cecilia” that just wasn’t right. 

On the flip side, I was now wide awake and alert.

To understand this next WTF-moment, I need to give you a clear understanding of the hotel's lobby layout. Upon entering the hotel, you're greeted by the reception area. To the left, you'll find the bar, accompanied by a cozy lounge that seamlessly extends into the restaurant and dining hall. On the right side, another lounge area stretches towards the lavatories and eventually leads to the rest of the hotel. To access the rest of the hotel, you can either walk up the stairs or continue past the restrooms toward the ballrooms, conference rooms, and fitness center. The only indoor entrance to the basement is situated discreetly beneath the stairs. 

Anyone entering the lobby from the restaurant, descending the stairs, or coming through the main entrance will be seen from the reception. There is no way around it. 

So now you can understand my utter astonishment when the basement camera’s motion alert was triggered. I was wide awake, sitting in the reception, no one had walked by or passed me. I turned on the surveillance software to get a complete view of the basement through the camera network. Nothing there. A glitch? Probably.. 

It was almost time for me to tour the grounds, so why not just start in the basement? Usually, I take that last, but I wasn’t exactly excited to go up those stairs again. 

So down I went. 

The basement is designed with these tunnel-like pathways. We have some offices down there and the tunnels were once intended to facilitate housekeeping. Luckily, you can walk the basement in one large circle, but it gets intersected by all these paths that crisscross. Thankfully, the basement routine only takes me through the circle.

As I walked the circle, I was hauntingly aware of my surroundings. Like the uneasiness you feel when walking alone in an unfamiliar city at night, sensing unseen eyes on you and feeling out of place. Naturally, I was aware that the heightened sense was probably due in part to the whole Cecilia incident and the unexplained camera alert. 

But still.. There was something else as well. It was as if there was a distant humming. Most likely because of the machinery in the basement, but it all felt so out of place.

Gradually, I noticed that I was becoming lightheaded. It made sense to me as I hadn't had anything to drink since before the Cecilia encounter. Deciding that a refreshing glass of water would be a welcome change from the numerous cups of coffee I typically consume during a shift, I aimed to detour into one of the basement restrooms.

As I turned the corner to take the next crossway, I was confronted by the source of the earlier movement. 

There, in the dim light, a set of animalistic eyes floated. They were locked on me. Completely still. I could slowly make out a shape behind the eyes. It was akin to a cat’s posture when hunting, waiting to pounce, but the outline was rough, with no fur. 

As I stood there, staring, it seemed almost like it was smiling back at me. I can’t explain it. It was a sort of DreamWorks-like grin. Unnatural in all ways but trying not to be. Like an imitation. It stood there with its cat eyes and cat posture, just four times as big, with its rough shape and C-shaped mouth. Observing me. Like I was a pet. 

I broke my staring off, and once again – I just noped the F out of there. I have never considered myself a coward or particularly afraid of anything, but honestly, I think everyone would’ve done the same. Luckily it didn’t move behind me. Nothing followed me. Not even a single sound. In truth, it was as if I had been enveloped in a thick blanket of deafening silence. Like there were no more sounds left. Until I shut the door behind me. Hard. 

I think under normal circumstances, I’d allow myself time to adjust. To secure the door behind me. To come together again. I think anyone would. But it was not allowed. As if on cue, the third WTF-moment of the night came. 

I glanced out of the lobby windows and saw the first rays of sunlight beginning to peek in between the beams linking the glass. It felt disorienting, like a severe case of jetlag – my mind struggled to comprehend what was happening, and as if my body wasn’t attuned correctly. The sun emerging meant I had been in that basement for hours. Either circling or staring.. 

I actually don’t know what happened from that moment until housekeeping came into work. I think I must’ve been walking in circles in the lobby. I didn’t think straight for that hour in between, completely lost in thought. The terrifying events of the night had left me feeling as though the very fabric of my reality had unraveled, and my distress must have been palpable.

The housekeeper, sensing my unease, didn't argue when I asked her to accompany me to room 213 to "check-up" on a guest. My disheveled state must have been enough to convince her that something was off.

The last WTF-moment came when we opened the door to room 213. 

There was nothing. Absolutely nothing. The room was spotless – no sign of "Cecilia," no menacing creature, no repulsive odor of raw meat. Even the blanket and heater had vanished.

Grasping at straws, I made up some dumb excuse of not getting enough sleep the night before and dozing off on the job, only for my subconscious to conjure this horrifying guest scenario. The housekeeper gave me a look that was equal parts disbelief and pity, but she ultimately decided to let the matter rest and headed downstairs.

Feeling completely drained after a thorough scolding from my coworker for failing to do my job properly, I headed home. Sleep seemed like the only refuge from the nightmarish events I had experienced. I tried to sleep, and I believe I did. But throughout my attempt at sleep, I was tormented by visions of Cecilia. Her looming, unnatural presence in a series of dreams. 

Was this merely a recurring nightmare, had my lie to my coworker actually been the truth? There is some solace in that thought. I feel like my own line between reality and my subconscious has become blurred. 

I am now back at work and writing this. I’m hoping some sense of control will return by doing so. For now, I am just sitting in the reception, happily surrounded by people in the bar, lobby, and restaurant. But I’m dreading the entire scenery once the clock strikes midnight and the bar closes. 

Please help me understand.
