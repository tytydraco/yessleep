Candle Lit Perv

The night sky, only lit by the fading moon and one small candle lit lantern. Under this night sky is a lone path in a forest and one walking this path ... is Lucy. A child only looking to be five years old holding a candle lit lantern to show the path. Her hair is as brown as the rotting leaves on the forest floor and a nightgown as gold as the burning candle wick inside her lantern. As the time goes by she feels like someone is near by ... watching her.

A small logging shed with a single light and a single glass pane and one single man inside … the one looking through this pane is only known as The Logger.
He is as hairy as the bears and built like one as well. His hair is a deep red resembling the blood soaked wood of his shed's floors. As he leaves his shed to catch his prey, Lucy feels the chill wind run down her neck.

As she keeps walking The Logger keeps following, getting closer and closer with his ax hidden behind him. One false step of The Logger snaps the smallest of twigs. Lucy turns around and says …

Lucy (softly) - Hello

The Logger (trying to stay calm ) - Hello there. Are you lost?

Lucy - Nope.

The Logger - Umm ... say, are you cold? I have a nice cabin we can share ... it's big enough for the both of us.

Lucy - I'm not cold. My lantern keeps me warm.

The Logger - Are you sure? My bed is nice and warm... you can join me.

Lucy - I …

As Lucy moved her lantern to continue talking, she saw the red glimmer of his blood stained ax behind his back. She looked into his eyes in fear and holding the lantern for dear life took off and ran. 

The Logger towered over her in height and it barely took him a minute to get closer to her again. One wrong step. One wrong step. One wrong ...

… She tripped …

She tried to get back up but The Logger threw his ax and the butt end hit her back and knocked her down again, right back to the forest floor. She tried to scream, scream as loud as her little lungs could but his hulking hand was already covering her mouth, his arm around her waist holding her and carrying her back to his shed. She tried thrashing herself free but to no avail, he was more than five times bigger then .

After what feels like an eternity of walking, he throws her into the shed and onto the slightly damp floor. He hung his ax back on the wall and looked at his newest victim. Lucy looked back and saw exactly what he was planning, the twistedness in his eyes, the cruelty in his smile, the anticipation in his hands. The plan was clear what he wanted to do with her.

Lucy still holding on to the lantern looked at him and showing no more fear ... she looked up at the dark light bulb hanging in between the two of them for some reason. Still out of breath because of the chase The Logger starts to say ...

Lucy ( silent )

The Logger (breathing heavily) - We ... are going to have so ... much ... fun ...

As soon as The Logger finishes his words Lucy snaps her fingers and the light bulb radiates such intense light it resembles the scorching sun near blinding him, he tries to open his eyes but the abundance of glass shards in his eyes stops him in his tracks and brings him to his knees ... and leaving Lucy completely unscathed, not even a scratch. 

All The Logger feels is the pain in his eyes. All The Logger hears though is Lucy ... laughing. After calming herself down she says in a eerie tone ...

Lucy - People like you … deserve to burn. 

Even though he is in excruciating pain The Logger tries his hardest to open his eyes. All he sees is flames, just flames, only flames. After a few hours when the flames start to calm down Lucy walks up to The Logger's charred corpse and eats the medium rare flesh that is left on his bones. Lucy is not a child … or a maiden in distress … she is something much more ancient and much more powerful than that.

When Lucy starts to feel full … she wipes the blood off of herself grabs her trusty lantern … and walks to the next target on her list ...

The moral of the story is not to be scared of strangers … it’s to not be a fucking rapist.

The end.
