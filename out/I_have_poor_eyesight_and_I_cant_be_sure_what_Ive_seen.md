A couple of weeks ago, it became hard for me to fall asleep. It wasnt gradual, simply one day, my brain decided that I have to be tortured every night before finally losing my conciousness


To put it simply, I am having nightmares before I even fall asleep. The moment I close my eyes, my brain sounds an alarm. I get anxious, sweaty, my heart starts to rase, and I get all sorts of creepy visions flooding my brain, flashing before my eyes. Like a night after my first ever horror movie, but instead it happens every day, every night.


The other thing that didnt help is that I have poor eyesight.
For a long time I had too much pride to admit it, or was telling myself that it wasn't that serious, that my life is not that sight dependant and that I dont have time to deal with this right now, but it was serious enought that most of the things on the other side of the room in the dark looked like blobs of varying size and shade, which was perfect for for my dellusions.


Every night I just have to wait, grinding my teeth together until my brain is too exausted to even think and shuts down, which in turn causes me to wake up half dead due to sleep deprivation, so lately I was thinking about going to a psychiatrist about that but due to long waiting lists my appointment is going to be no less than three months away, which means that until then, every day will have to end with me clawing my way into the sweet embrace of mother sleep, like a neglected toddler.
Nowadays I go to sleep late so to not to prolong my suffering.


Yesterday I fell onto my bed somewhere at 1 PM, and reluctantly shut my eyes. First goes my heart, it inflates with helium and tries to go up my throat, taking some of my breath with it. My skin started to tingle a bit, as if something was poking it with tiny needles, the sweat started breaking through.


Then I started seeing things. It didin't have a shape, it was almost just a concept brought to life in my imagination, but for some reason, it scared me. My thought, akin to a broken engine, ran away, sprinting from one extreme from the other, I see my room, the part of it that is to the right side of my bed. It is dimly lit, but has a big crack in the centre, splitting it into two.


The more this though ran, the more this hole took shape, until it became apparent that It wasnt that there's nothing there, it's that something stood between my bed and the other side of my room.
It was getting closer, looming over me, it bent with an intense creak coming from its spine, until what I think is its face was as close as possible to mine.
So close, as if it was trying to feel my panicked and uneven breath, so close, that I could feel the warmth radiating from its skin.


For several moments I saw what I though was a human face, but it was so fleeing that I couldnt help but doubt if I actually saw something, at this point I was hallucination on low levels. Satisfied, I closed my eyes again. This back-and-fourth, a tag of war between me and my brain was going on for god knows how many hours until I fell asleep, and was free from this nightmare.


This morning I called in sick. Wasnt even a lie, I woke up sore, felt like the moment I woke up  a flashbang went off nearby, I was weak, dissoriented, and tired. After thirty minutes of my hunger fighting with my urge to never leave the bed, that just mere hours ago felt like it was made of jagged stones, hunger won, and I went down to my kitchen, wobbling around like a leaf in the wind. 


I made myself some porridge, tea with lemon, turned my fan on and sat scrolling my phone, waiting for my meal to cool down a bit. The sun started assaulting my eyes with its rays as it crawled the horison and at the same time the fan was blowing my hair into my face and mouth so I stood up to turn down the power a bit. I wraped my hand over the fan controls and froze, reading the brand name on the fan case. 


No matter how many times I read it the word would not stick to my brain, as it was preoccupied thinking of something different.
There was that funny feeling again, but instead of coming to me in the dead of night, it crashed down my stares from my room, and came running into my kitchen right into into my cupboards, smashing dishes.


It is a cheap, white fan, with a frustratingly short cord. Putting the fan casing together was a pain that spanned an entire hour, and after that I was thankful to the lord above that I had to do it only once.


Because I bought only one cheap, white fan, which I brought down from my room two days ago.


Shaking, but trying to keep myself together, I, like by the force of gravity was pulled to my bedroom door:
first into the corridor, then up the stairs on all fours.


I opened the door, putting all my weight unto the doorknob, saw it, the back of my computer seat, not obstructed by any cheap white fans.


I sat in the kitchen for a while, trying to rationalise it all. The food went cold so I had to reheat it, cold tea was nice, but sour, since the lemon sat there for more than usual.
Either the fan moves by itself at night, somone else moves it, or...


The thought got stuck in my throat, not letting any more of the porridge through, so I put it in the fridge for later.

I couldnt sit in one place, I paced the first floor endlessly, leaving wet sweaty footprints, I assume.
My nightmares left me constantly on the edge of my fight or flight response. 
Evening came, no matter how much I wanted it to wait,and after it, the sun finally thrown me to the wolves of my mind.


I planned to not sleep this day, but my sickness was getting worse and all I could think of was falling under my warm blanket, but the thought of someone, something, still being there never left me either.


So I left the lights on, maybe childish, but I thought that it would protect me, or at least give me more clarity. For the first time in maybe a week, I was so exausted, I hoped that I would fall asleep the moment my head touches the pillow, the moment the weight of my eyelids pins them down.
And it did, I felt it, my mind slowly dissolving, tired, the fire of counscious thought being extinguished. I felt light, free and careless.


But then I felt a jolt, somewhere in my heart, like it was dangling on a chain and it suddenly broke, casting it into my stomach, falling and causing waves of discomfort across my skin.
I opened my eyes, mouth agape ready to scream. And I saw nothing.
I feared that I finally went blind, but no, I saw moon light bouncing off my ceiling lamp. The lights were switched off. I was left in darkness, and worst of all, that feeling, that rotten feeling never left me after opening my eyes.


I slowly turned my head, my pillow gave way and let my head slowly roll to the side, making muffled noises.
I stopped when my peripheral vision reached the wall on the other side of my room. 


There, scraping the wall with its side, stood a white blob with uneven edges that I mistook for my fan last night. The more I looked at it, the more blury it went, my eyes were sore and i assume red but I could not blink, I didnt want to miss the moment it would charge at me, or move, or breathe. 
My eyes couldnt take it as long as I wanted


So I blinked

It didnt move.

Again.

As still as before.


I carefully rolled to the other side, facing the wall to my left. I thought of calling 911, but what would it do, if it found out that I knew it was there? That it's disguise is found out? I took the phone anyway.


Thats where I am now. Scared shitless and feeling like throwing up from fear and my sickness. I feel like I am stuck in a cave, with noone around to call for help, having all the time in the world to ponder what led me here, and what I should've done. Waiting for inevitable to happen. Theres still plenty of hope though, It didnt hurt me before, even when I was alseep, so why would it now? 

Whatever happens I am leaving this house tomorrow, I'll leave an update if I can.
