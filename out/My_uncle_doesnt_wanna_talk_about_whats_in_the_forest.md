My name is Gonzalo and I'm from a small village in the Brazil , i have one brother and 2 cousins 

My cousins lived in an isolated farm with his mom and dad which was very far away from where we lived , but I loved to go to his place , like who would want to spent time sitting near a tree in a field along with you siblings and cousins just after a stressful exams . I always used to look forward to going there since I had no one here to play with me except my friends who also lived very far away from where I lived


This was supposed to be yet another trip to my cousins house , another long playing session with them , playing hide and seek in the farm , telling ghost stories to each other at night , playing board games and then fighting if anyone of us lost ... Only if I knew what was awaiting for me there 


So I reached my cousins house and they were really happy to see me , lets call them maria and Martinez , I had been a whole year since I had last visited them and nothing had changed there , large fields covered in grass , lots of animals living there in peace , blissful winds brushing my hairs , this is an escape from stress and reality

My aunt has as always cooked some delicious food for us , muching on them while talking to my cousins felt like heaven 

It was decided that I would sleep with my cousins , I had no problem with that decision, that's what I was here for , the room was big but if was pretty small for 4 kids , and it was quite dark too with having only one window the looked out into the forest , I was not complaining though , more ways of scaring my cousins I thought

My parents left the next day since they had some important meetings to attend which was very important for their buisness but they didn't wanted to ruin our fun so let us stay with our cousins , they trusted my uncle and I had spent a lot of time with them prior to this so they felt pretty comfortable with us staying there 

Now this was the 3rd day ,I was playing hide and seek and I decided to hide inside the forest , this was my first time being inside the forest , it was dark and very deep , but overall I didn't see anything that can kill me so I decided to hide there 

Sometime later I heard a faint cry from a bit deeper into the forest , like a cry you will hear when an animal gets stabbed or injured , and they I started hearing growling , not of a dog though , it was something else , it was like some kind of demon screaming in victory 

I made the wise decision and ran out of the forest , i didn't care if they found or me not , getting found by my cousins was better than whatever creature was lurking in the forests

I came out and I saw my uncle along with my cousins , they looked worried , my uncle asked me what was in doing in there , i said i was just hiding , he said “ never go inside that forest ever again " in a kind of worried voice , like there was something bad lurking in the forests 

Later that day I asked my uncle about what was there in the forests and I also told him about the sounds I was hearing , he just told me that it was probably a dog or something , I didnf knew a dog can make a make go pale , then i asked him why did he ask me to no go inside the forest ever again,  he told me “ you wouldn't wanna know what's there , I have faced them when I was a child , and I was traumatized , so I'm trying my best to save you from them " . I wanted to ask him who was “ them " when our aunt called us for lunch

And then it happened , i was sleeping peacefully when I woke up due to thirst , so i decided to go to the kitchen and and take a glass of water , when I went to the kitchen I saw my uncle and one of his friends talking and beside them I saw a gun , not a normal shotgun or a rifle , it was an assault rifle , I saw some machetes and katanas too but the ar was the main thing , they looked at me , I saw dear in there eyes , they had a worried look but they still smiled at me , I drank the water and then went to my room 

When I went there I saw my cousins , look at the window , looking into the forest more specifically, it took me a minute to realise what they were looking at but when I saw that , my  soul left my body , I saw a demon like creature . It has antlers coming out of its head , its face looked more like a skull rather than skin , it's arms where longer than our whole body . It was marching out of the forest towards our house , then it disappeared for our view

We were confused and scared at the same time , we just sat there sitting in silence , thinking were we all hallucinating or was this real , I could have had a hallucination but all of us at the same time seemed kinda unlikely 


Our dead silence was broken by rustling downstairs , followed by couple of gunshots , then I saw my uncle's friend coming inside our room and breathe a sigh of relief when he saw that we were safe he told us “ don't leave this room no matter what and don't open the door " 

We said okay and he went downstairs again , my brother asked me “ john , did you see that he was bleeding from his hand " i didn't notice any bleeding but everyone else did ,

The gunshots started again , along with growling , the same growling I heard when I was hiding inside the forest , and then it stopped completely . The growling , the gunshots ,things falling , everything had stopped for a moment. It felt like the world had just stopped . I wanted to take a peek outside but I didn't because I remember what my uncle's friend had told me so I stayed inside our room , we waited for a long time . Once again , nothing . No one came inside our room to check on us 

After what felt like years the sun finally game our but we still didn't leave for a long time , we decided to leave the room and check on us when we were confirmed that there was nothing downstairs , I would never forget what we saw downstairs

Sleeping between a bunch of bullets and weapons were the lifeless bodies of my uncle , aunt and his friend . They have been deeply disfigured , we wouldn't even have been able to understand who was who if it wasn't for the colour of the shirts they were wearing , 

I couldn't believe it , how did they die , what was coming out of the forest , who were they firing at . I guess it didn't matter anymore 

I quickly called my parents while my cousins sat there in silence , unable to comprehend the reality, their parents got killed by an unknown creature


What happened after that was a vague memory , bunch of tears and gasps , that's all I could remember from that period


That incident happened almost 20 years ago , my cousins had been living with us since that, I don't know what happened that day downstairs , what was there in the forests that scared my uncle so much
