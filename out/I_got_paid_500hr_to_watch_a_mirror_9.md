After I biked a few blocks, I got to the small brick building. I made sure to lock my bike on the small stand in the parking lot, before ringing the security doorbell camera. In less than a minute, a shrill beep sounded, then the clicking of the automated lock opening. I pushed open the door, getting my first look at the place. It was surprisingly sterile, with white tiles covering both the walls, ceiling and floors. There weren't any decorations or cubicles like most offices, just bright industrial lights that beamed down like spotlights.

I took a deep inhale, it was a rubbery new car smell. Like walking into a shoe store. The lights flickered occasionally, buzzing with electricity. 

I spotted a receptionist desk, a lady dressed in plain jeans and a blouse sat up abruptly. Her eyes were bloodshot, and she moved like a startled animal. 

"Hello, you must be.." She paused for a moment, looking at my printed form.
"Josiah. Here for the job listing."

I nodded, about to speak until she cut me off by grabbing my arm, blabbing about pointless things, like the weather or the news. 

She stopped talking once we reached another room, going out of her way to stare at the floor. 

"Josiah, you will be watching the mirror. You will not sleep or disturb it, and do not try to influence it."

My mind reeled from these odd instructions, a pit beginning to form in my stomach. Do not influence the reflection? 

She seemed to sense my sudden nervousness, and smiled. Her teeth were white and blocky.

"I worked as the supervisor for many years. Its odd, but you'll get used to it." 

This raised a question in my mind, which I worked up the courage to ask.

"Is there someone watching it now?" I pointed to the room, even though the mirror was blocked off with a velvet looking curtain.

"No. Its been.. quiet lately. But around this time of year, it becomes active. We need workers now more than ever to watch him."

I noticed the change, as she referred to the mirror now as 'him'. She went on to explain things, that the mirror became active every winter, around the same time anually, that they always hired multiple people, but they usually didnt stick around for more than the time period. It was active for only a month at a time, she said. I still don't know what she means about active- the implication of it doing anything besides reflecting made my stomach churn.

"You will work from 3am until the next person comes to relieve you of the shift." She didnt say when the next person would- just that id have time to continue with my daily life.

I felt like shit for asking this next question.

"So, its $500 an hour?"

"Yes. We desperately need people like you, to watch him. We will pay anything.."

There it was again. Him.

She started again. "Please, head on in and take a seat. I will give you further instructions over the intercom." She gestured towards a small audio box in the corner of the room, across from the covered mirror. Still- she didnt look at it, like her pupils danced around the space it took up.

I sat on the stiff plastic chair, across from the mirror. It was an uncomfortable chair, like something you'd sit on at a school assembly. 

The intercom cracked, startling me.

"Remove the cloth from the mirror. Do not touch its surface." The audio was breaking up, before adjusting and becoming clear.
 
I leaned forward, careful to lift the curtain over the mirror without touching the glass, setting it on the back of the chair. I had revealed an antique looking mirror, its golden frame etched with fancy designs and symbols. Some were just random swirls, others seemed more.. purposeful.

She spoke again. "Good. Introduce yourself to the mirror, and remember well what you say. Do not hesitate to share."

I, being a stupid kid, didn't see anything off about this. The only thing I was concerned about was the fat paycheck this would give me.

"Hello.. I'm Josiah. I am 18- male." I wasnt sure what she wanted me to say. Weaknesses, fears, my fucking favorite color? 

The mirror didn't shift, didnt reply like something out of a fairytale. I dont know what I was expecting. All I saw was my exhausted face, eyebags heavy enough to weigh me down.

"You will began to doubt yourself. That is normal. You're own reflection will become a stranger, if you dont concentrate. Goodluck, Josiah."

What the hell? A stranger, to my own reflection? The intercom cut off with another crackle, before I was left with silence. I still wasn't as freaked out as I should've been, just leaning back over the chair, staring at the mirror on the wall. 

There weren't any clocks in the room, my phone had been taken at the front desk- so that was a bust. I didn't know if it had been minutes, or hours. The room was isolated, no sunlight or moonlight could pour in from any crevice or crack.
