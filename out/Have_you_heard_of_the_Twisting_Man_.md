Hey everyone! So big disclaimer - I am not OP. I am a longtime lurker. I saw this post before the first update and I thought it was REALLY fun, so I copy and pasted it into a doc I keep with my favorite stories from here, like I always do just in case they get lost. Well, turns out after the last update the author deleted it, so I guess my weird ritual paid off! I think they deleted it as a part of the \~spookiness\~ of the story (you'll see why), but it really seemed like a shame for it to just be gone forever, so I contacted OP and asked permission to post it. 

They were really cagey about the whole thing and why they decided to get rid of it, like they only gave really weird one word answers... they didn't sound interested in letting me repost it at first, but we talked a little more and it turns out we live pretty much in the same area! Nothing like shared stories of home to get someone to open up, haha.

They ultimately said I could share the story as long as I didn't attach their username/name to it... I wish I could give proper credit but as per their wishes I won't do so. I hope that doesn't break rule 2, if it does pls contact me mods and I can clear things up maybe?? Anyways, here is the post! Also disclaimer - this is the raw stuff. I did fix a few spelling mistakes, but aside from that, I changed nothing. Hope you guys enjoy the story as much as I did!

(Man sorry for the long post, got longer than I intended, but I felt the context was needed.)

Ugh, I feel so stupid posting here, but I'm kind of losing my mind and I don't know where else to turn. I've never really believed in spooky shit like this, and unfortunately neither do the cops, so I'm hoping someone can help me. Obvious burner account because all I need is for my fiance to find this and think she's set up to marry a whackjob, haha. Well, fuck, maybe she is, at this rate. Anyways.

Have you guys ever heard the stupid nursery rhyme about this thing called the Twisting Man? It sounds so goddamn cliche but I remember it was kind of like a whole thing when I was a kid. It was like the whole slenderman fad but on a much smaller scale? But it was weird. Like, it wasn't popular, no one would talk about it really. But if you mentioned 'the Twisting Man", you could tell other kids *knew* about it. They just got this sorta distant look in in their eyes for a second, would go super quiet, and then afterwards act like nothing happened and insist they knew nothing about it.

Like, when I was in, fuck idk like maybe 3rd grade??? I remember hearing this girl singing the song. She was sorta this lonely kid, she would always be digging in the dirt. In the recess area, at the very back limit of where we were allowed to play, there was this hill. At the base of it there was this big chunk of smooth granite sticking partially out of the ground. Or maybe it was just a regular rock?? It was like two feet wide, one foot thick, embedded in the dirt. I swear this is relevant stick with me here lol.

Anyways, a bunch of kids got obsessed with digging it out for a while, me included. We had this wild notion we were gonna dig it up and sell it and be millionaires or something. You know, the sort of stupid shit kids come up with lol.

But anyways, after it became obvious that it would take months of digging to get the thing out, most of us gave up. But not that one girl. I swear she was digging at it for years, it's a wonder she didn't get it out. My mom drove us by school once during the summer, and I swear I saw her there, crouched over the rock, still going at it with a little plastic trowel and one of those shaped buckets kids use to make sandcastles on the beach.

Well, I was kind of a loner too, and to be honest I sort of had a crush on her. I guess I found the digging sort of intriguing and I was curious idk. So I thought I should try and make a friend at least. But when I got close, she was singing the rhyme, just very quietly beneath her breath. I barely remember how it went but uh, it was something like

**The Twisting Man lives in the back of my head,**

**He lives in the places I don't understand,**

**In memories lost and in memories dead,**

**He's biding his time in my dreamland,**

(uh and then this part was like an octave up)

**To stop him, we'll need the most clever of plans,**

**Let's lock him inside with the sand man,**

**A thousand names to hide his face,**

**And keep us from his last embrace.**

Real comforting and fun. How do kids come up with this shit lol

Anyways. It scared the shit out of me so I gave up on the idea of befriending her. Literally turned tail, ran, and went to go eat lunch alone in the cafeteria lol. Well, what do you know, it turns out I dodged a bullet. Fast forward a few years and she's still a loner, talks to nobody. One day, out of the blue, she gets expelled, and no one knows why. Everyone is fuckin flabbergasted because like yeah, she was weird and a loner, but she never did anything wrong???? She was a sweet kid from what I remember, goody two shoes type.

Anyways, my gym teacher Mr. Dorsey also went on leave around the same time. He was sort of a goofball, but a good guy and my favorite teacher. When he left at the same time as Rachel, we sort of feared the worst, but eventually he came back a few months later with his chest all bandaged up. 

When I asked him what happened, he got this haunted look in his eyes... I think he knew he shouldn't have been telling a kid all this, but he wasn't married and I don't think he had much family. I think he had no one else to tell, and he needed someone to know what he went through. Poor guy. He pulled me aside and told me I could never repeat what he would tell me. Well, I'm sorry Mr. Dorsey - I'm grasping at straws here, I have to.

Here's what he told me:

Apparently, in like 4th grade, they passed this rule where you couldn't bring toys from home to recess. Like you could only use stuff from the school, cause I guess one kid stole another kid's toys, they got in a fight, yadda yadda its not important. So this kid - fuck what was her name, I think it was Rachel? Yeah, something like that - anyways like I said, she was digging with that little shovel and pail she brought from home. I guess eventually a teacher confiscated it. Well, that didn't stop her.

Apparently, the teacher than was on recess duty was fed up with Rachel's digging and went to go tell her to stop. Mr Dorsey got fuckin quiet at this point, which is how I knew he wasn't fucking with me - the guy is like 6'3, the loudest person I have ever known, the kinda dude who is always smiling and never brought down by anything. He *shrunk* when he got to this part.

They caught her digging at the ground with her *nails.* Or, fuck, what was left of them, apparently she scraped most of them off, got blood all over the rock, all over herself... The teacher that found her said that even when she started yelling at Rachel to stop, she didn't move an inch. She said her eyes were closed, but she just kept digging feverently. The teacher couldn't even move her, she said it was like trying to push a wall. 

So she got Mr. Dorsey, and he stepped in and had to pull her away, and she just started screaming. But the way he described it - the scream had no tone. It was just this like, long, monotonous drone. He said she grabbed him around his body and almost tried to like, bear hug him to death. Her voice eventually broke from the screaming and she got really close up to his ear and started *wheezing at him*. Mr.Dorsey said that she managed to break a few of his ribs with her death hug before he got her to the school nurses' office, and four people had to work together to pull her off of him.

Then, as if it didn't even happen, she just... immediately calmed down.

When they asked her wtf she was doing, all she would say was that she had to "keep herself from waking up" and had to "smother him in the crib". She just kept saying that, again and again, keeping her eyes closed the entire time.

Mr. Dorsey didn't know what happened after that. Once the rumors started spreading, I guess her family must have chosen to move her to another school? Or maybe she went to some sort of ward to recover. I don't know. I just thought it was creepy and sad... and then I moved on with my life. Never heard heads or tails of her. Until uh, last night.
