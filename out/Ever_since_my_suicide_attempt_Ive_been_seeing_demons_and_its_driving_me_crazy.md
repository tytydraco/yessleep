It all started when my mom asked me to go down to the store and buy some coffee.

Now I understand that for most of you, this seems like a fairly easy task, well not for me. Mom just calls me lazy, but she just doesn't get it. Every time I get past the front porch. I feel like I'm about to drown.  It's as if the world is going to swallow me whole and I'm going to disappear. miraculously on that day, I got past the front porch, but I needed something to focus on.  Looking at my feet I count the steps to the metro station.  Should I buy coffee or try to kill myself? 

This was the big question in my head on that day. Without even thinking about it my legs just guided me to the metro station. It was odd needless to say, the thought of going to the store, speaking with the cashier and buying a bag of coffee beans felt so dreadful I would rather kill myself. No more social interactions, no more going out and that's it.   


These thoughts guided me to the station. I aligned myself next to other people waiting for the train. I was looking at the pitch-black hole at the end of the tunnel and it was looking back at me. as if I could feel something coming from there. the light at the end of the tunnel felt so soothing, all I needed to do was just jump in front and that's it. So I tried, but just as I was supposed to leap in front of the train, I felt someone yanking me back and I fell. I feel bad. I felt how the back of my head hit the ground and made a strange sound. afterwards agonizing pain.   


I felt like I could die from pain. People started to gather around me. That felt even worse.   
"she's bleeding.."  
"was she trying to kill herself?"  
"go on get an ambulance."

All I could do was mumble to people to stop. As I adjusted my gaze, what I saw horrified me.  A middle-aged woman was standing in front of me, however, her face was distorted, it was thin as a paper. As if she was drawn in two dimensions. That's when I felt a terrible smell coming from my right. It was a young man but his whole face was rotting. But they stood there as if nothing. just looking at me with a bothered face. All I could feel was terror filling me up. 

"Please get away from me I don't need an ambulance!"    


I screamed out and yanked myself back, to get a better view. It wasn't only them, it was everyone. It was as if I really died and woke up in hell. There was a woman who had two heads, one was beautiful young, another was old, wrinkled, as if it belonged to a person in their 80s. An old man next to her had his head upside down.  I think I also saw a pig dressed in a suit. This was all so very hard to stomach. All of them were staring at me.   


"What's wrong with you?"

"Are you okay?"

"Do you need help?"

All I could do was shake my head, look at my feet and run out of there as fast as I could. I was trying not to look away from my torn shoes. All I needed to do was focus on my steps. one step at a time. Whatever happened I could not look up. I for sure ended up in hell, this was just all too much. Finally, I got out and the headache got worse. I honestly wish I killed myself it all would have been so much easier.    


"Now I need to buy coffee."

Damn, thinking about it all made things even worse. I managed to get to the market, opening the door I was revising the text in my head.   


"Hello, can I please have a package of fresh coffee beans?" 

Or no need for a hello? This was all too complicated, my head hurt so much. I looked up to the cashier and froze in a place. I saw a personal figure in a uniform, but instead of her face, a pitch-black hole was looking at me. I felt like the hole could swallow me inside, it was as if someone was looking at me from the other side.  


"Did you lose all your manners? what do you want kid?"  


I heard the voice coming from the black hole, I could feel my heartbeat faster and sweat started to form on my forehead.   


"I'm sorry, can I have some coffee?"

"What kind of coffee?"

that's when I froze in place, what kind did I want? All I could do was think about the black hole in front of me, what if it swallows me?  I felt the hole getting bigger and bigger.   


"Are you def?"

Its voice was sharp.   


"Beans."

I dropped the coins, grabbed the package and ran out of the shop. The black hole was still in front of my eyes, ready to swallow me at any moment, I just ran for home as fast as I could. All I wanted was just to get home as fast as I could. I opened the door and rushed inside; Mom was there looking at me from the kitchen. It was so strange; it was as if half part of her body and face was a woman's, and another one was a man's. I couldn't help but stare at her with sheer horror and shock.   


"Oh my goodness, you managed to fuck up this simple task as well? what the fuck is wrong with you? Are you not normal? It isn't enough that your worthless father isn't around here, I have to be the man and the woman of the house!  you look like a corpse! look at yourself!"

I just dropped the coffee beans and ran for my room, after closing the door I managed to regulate my breathing. I had no idea what was going on but her words, feeling like a man and a woman lingered in my mind. What if I could see how people felt? what if that hit just made me see people's feelings? After all, working as a cashier the whole day could make a person feel like falling into a black hole right? And the flat woman could've been thinking of herself that way, same for the rotten man, then how about me?

I took a deep breath and looked at myself in the mirror next to me. This is when I froze. A corpse was looking at me from the other side. A cold gaze as if looking in the distance. So tell me what's going on? Did I die that day and was I sent to hell? Or am I just seeing people's souls now? What's going on?
