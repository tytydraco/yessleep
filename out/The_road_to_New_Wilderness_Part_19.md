[\[Part 18\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17avoka/the_road_to_new_wilderness_part_18/)

Several blocks further in, I squeezed into an overhang made from the collapsed front of a building and pulled the special plastic army canteen the pirates had given me from my belt. With a gas mask on, and the air poisoned by whatever chemical dump had been hit by the bombs, the only way I could drink was through a special tube that ran from the canteen adaptor to my mask, and my throat burned with a dryness that cried out for respite.  
Scanning my surroundings, I tilted the canteen back, and chugged through the straw inside my gas mask.  
*How big is this town? I could be here all day. Do they seriously expect me to find one tiny box on the first try?*  
I blew air back through the tube to keep the canteen from caving in and tried not to think about what I’d do once it got dark. The fog around me hung so thick, that at times I couldn’t see more than ten yards, and at other times, a breeze would shift it enough to see around a hundred at best. Fires churned from various pyres, former dwellings full of pine, drywall, insulation, and plastic going up in thick black smoke. The few sections of my skin that were exposed itched with the light ash that rained from the sky, and the water in my mouth tasted strong of plastic and chlorine. Everything gritted and crunched under my shoes, and more creatures screamed in the distance, the high shrieks of Puppets curling in my ears like worms.  
“They’re moving away.” I cocked my head to one side like I’d seen Chris do, mouth slightly agape to hear better, and whispered to myself in a bid to stay calm. “Which means they either lost my scent, or—”  
*Screech-thud. Screech-thud. Screech-thud.*  
Pebbles and bits of crumpled asphalt rattled on the ground beside me, and the vibrations rippled through my legs to flare inside my mind with alarm.  
With trembling fingers, I jammed the canteen back into my belt, and fumbled with the cloth flap to secure it in place.  
*Screech-thud.*  
My chest tightened, and I dove onto my belly to crawl beneath a fallen roof beam, squeezing like a bug deeper into the ruin.  
*Screech-thud.*  
Steel groaned right above me, metal slamming over and over into the melted tarmac with rapid beats, as thunderous feet skittered closer.  
I shoved my head and arms through a gap in the rubble, wriggling into total darkness, desperate to get out of the open. Like a mole, I burrowed into the debris, crawled against tight walls that rubbed my shoulders, and prayed for an opening somewhere. All it would take was one cave in, one drop-off into an old basement, one creature coming up the tunnel toward me, and I’d never make it out.  
*Wham.*  
The entire rubble pile shifted, as a massive steel I-beam impaled the dirt not ten feet in front of me, piercing the dark with soft gray light from the outside.  
Frozen in place, I could only watch as the leg withdrew, and held my breath.  
*Bwwwooonnnggg.*  
On the heels of the electro-synth foghorn blast, a gargantuan shadow passed over the hole, with eight long legs made of flash-rusted steel that stood as tall as a three-story building. Braided metal cables snaked up each one, leading to a long, spinal column like tangle of jumbled metal and greasy black sinews. A big round signal dish at the front swung back and forth like a head, with a ring of bright white lights around it that flickered with every strange sound the beast made. Beneath it, a single loudspeaker hung by both bolts, and an array of pulsating black tissue, as if whoever or whatever had made this thing couldn’t decide between it being a machine, or a living being. Thicker cables swayed just under the ‘head’ in the way I’d seen spider mandibles do, only there were dozens of them, each long enough to reach the ground if they extended to their full length. In a quick glance, one could easily have mistaken it for a walking radio tower.  
*If it makes one wrong step, I’ll be human jelly.*  
My lungs ached, but something caught my gaze beneath the mutant, something big and square grasped in its mass of cable-mandibles.  
A truck.  
The Humvee swung along, dented, charred, and broken in the grasp of the Echo Spider, all its tires flat, the bulletproof glass smeared from the heat of the missiles. I couldn’t see inside it for the soot on the glass, but I figured there couldn’t be a living soul left. After all, how long would someone last, trapped inside that thing with no food or water, the outside air poisoned, unable to escape after the bombs fell? Yet, the enormous insectoid being still carried it along, like a bird with a bundle of twigs in its beak, and that jarred something loose in my mind.  
*It's collecting metal.*  
Watching it go, my fear slipped away a little, and a timid curiosity took hold. The spider hadn’t seen me, or I’d be dead already. If it truly was collecting scrap, like the ones in the northern junkyard that had given our mechanics so much trouble, then maybe, just maybe, it had accidentally scooped up a small black box? My gut begged me to stay hidden in the claustrophobic burrow under the rubble, but in my mind, I knew there was only one way to find out for sure.  
As soon as the Echo Spider passed on to the next block, I clawed my way up through the hole its leg had made in the debris, and into the gray light of Collingswood.   
I could still see the huge creature from a distance, but it moved fast enough that I couldn’t wait, or the fog would swallow it up. Once I jerked myself free from the last desperate grasps of the broken wood and shattered cinderblock, I skidded down the heap to the street, and jogged after the beast.  
Had anyone told me a week ago that I would be chasing some giant mechanical spider through a ruined city, I would have laughed in their face. Now I fell into my jog, eyes switching back and forth between my quarry and the ruins around me, my snug home in Louisville the furthest thing from my mind. No doubt there were few creatures here big enough to challenge the Echo Spiders, so they didn’t care who or what they walked over, but I couldn’t be so careless. One wrong step, whether too close, or too far behind, and I could risk losing the mutant, or worse, running face-first into one of its steel legs. However, if I rounded the bend and found myself in the midst of more Puppets, or God-forbid, Birch Crawlers, I’d be dead in a heartbeat.  
Onward we went, the unsuspecting iron-bug and I, its feet screech-thumping, mine crunching over loose stones and charred wood. At block six, my lungs began to ache, and I remembered how little I’d had to eat since leaving the *Harper’s Vengeance*. Despite my water break earlier, dryness crept back into my throat, and a painful stitch cramped in my side. I had a harder and harder time keeping my footfalls soft on the wrinkled pavement, and almost turned my ankle in exhaustion three times.  
*Bwwwooonnnggg.*  
Bright white light slashed through the fog just in front of me, and I stumbled over my feet, skidding to a stop just inside a nearby doorway that hadn’t collapsed.  
My heart raced, and I poked my head out the moment the light slid by.  
*Oh, Hannah, what have you gotten yourself into?*  
As near as I could guess, the ruin across the street had once been a school, built from red brick, at least two stories tall. The bombs had smashed it’s upper floors like a Lego set under a bulldozer, with only the four corners of the building left standing, along with two rectangular concrete shafts in the center, likely for either stairs or an elevator system. Crumbled brick had been shoved to the outside of the building in a ring of orange-colored rocks, and the various holes, alcoves, and destroyed sections of the second story had been filled with all kinds of scrap metal. Bent sheet steel roofing, rusted iron streetlamps, and entire cars were jumbled together in a huge mound, everything held together by gooey strands of a strange black substance that looked eerily familiar.  
*Just like the Brain Shredder.*  
I swallowed to keep my stomach from rising in revulsion. Meat. The spiders were holding their nest in place with the same material that glued them together, long ebony tendrils of living, mutated flesh. In spite of the walls of goo, I could see them inside, four huge metal insects scuttling back and forth with clicks and chatters that sent shivers down my spine, and some of the swollen sections of black seemed to move on their own, like nightmarish pimples ready to burst with rot.  
Flattening myself back inside the doorway, I bit my lip to keep down a whimper, and shook my head at myself.   
I couldn’t do this.  
I couldn’t go in there.  
After all, who was I kidding? I wasn’t some badass ranger; I was the skinny girl who got knocked out during gym class by a rouge football throw, and everyone had laughed. I was the quiet one who sat in the third row and watched Kelsey Dunmark get asked out by Robert McPhearson because I never worked up the courage to speak to Robert at all. I was the nameless kid who held the camera for Matt and Carla because thousands of subscribers would have found me too boring to watch instead. Almost everything that I’d survived so far had been by sheer dumb luck, not through skill or bravery. I couldn’t find the stupid box, not with all those spiders in there; it was impossible.  
Tears brimmed at my eyes as I slid to the ground, pulled my knees to my chest, and sniffled under my gas mask.  
*There’s nothing wrong with being scared.*  
Jamie’s voice called through my tangled thoughts in an encouraging whisper, her faith in me unwavering as it had been from the start.  
*Never assume they can’t be beaten.*  
Chris’s warm smile floated over my mind’s eye, and deep inside, a little flame ignited in my chest, a longing to see him again, a burning need, a pull like gravity.  
I blinked at my tears and took a deep breath.  
My legs stretched, the calves pushed me back onto my feet, and calm smoothed over my frazzled nerves.  
“Red lights and low voices.” With one finger, I switched off the safety on my Type-9. “That’s the name of the game.”  
Pushing the fear out of my head, I darted around the corner, and sprinted over the street to the school as fast as my legs could go.   
Black walls of living muscle reared in front of me, poisonous fog swirled around my feet, the mechanical chittering of the Echo Spiders filled my ears. My shoes skidded and crunched over the broken asphalt, and my heart roared. Any moment, the spiders would notice, and I’d hear the screech of their sirens as they bore down on me, the terrible white light from their heads blinding my eyes. They would rip me apart, suck out my guts, and string me up like a deer.  
Somehow, I reached the other side, and slowed to a halt beside one grimy, fire-blackened brick corner.  
*I made it. I actually made it. I didn’t think that would work.*  
Stunned, but still fueled by adrenaline, I swept my eyes over the mass of tendons that lined the gaps in the walls and caught sight of a spot dark from shadow instead of mutated flesh.  
At one time, it must have been some kind of corner office window, but the bombs had of course blown it out and scorched the interior. However, the black growth stretched thinner here, and with the dim red glow of my headlamp, I could make out a room with a door on the other side. Tendrils and things that looked like roots snaked across the burnt carpet. Other than that, it appeared . . . well . . . as ‘clean’ as anything could get around here.  
Gripping the edge of the window, I hoisted myself inside, careful to check each corner of the cramped space. A desk had been half-buried by falling debris to my right, and there were a few picture frames on the floor to my left, their glass shattered, the photographs burned away. The ceiling light hung halfway out of the powdery foam tiles around it, and more strange black tissue could be seen inside the ceiling cavity. My red headlight bathed the room in a bloody aura, and I shuddered at the sensation of both shoes smearing over greasy muscle strands on the floor, like stepping on sticky chunks of bicycle inner tubes.  
*Don’t think about it, don’t think about it, don’t think about it.*  
I cocked my head to one side, and tried to slow my breathing so I could listen better.  
Echo Spiders screech-thumped somewhere on the other side of the closed door with occasional chittering calls to one another, and a low slushing, squelching noise hummed in the background, reminding me of intestinal rumbles. Despite the gray light of the foggy exterior, everything inside seemed to be some shade of black or red in my headlight beam.  
Crossing to the door, I turned the knob with a dry, rusted *creak*, and poked my head into the expanse beyond.  
“Oh, great.” I muttered under my gas mask.  
The door opened into a semi-intact hallway on the first floor, blocked by a cave-in of cinder block and metal to my right, but the rest of it still open to my left. Dusty green metal lockers lined the white-painted walls on both sides, the low-slung ceiling covered in the same pepper-and-salt color ceiling tile as the office, with more extinguished fluorescent lights that would never work again. Vibrations from every step the massive spiders took nearby reverberated through the floor, and I realized the mound rested above me now, these old hallways more akin to tunnels in an ant hill than corridors where hordes of students had trudged to their next class. Still, much of it reminded me of my not-so-distant high school days, and it would have been nostalgic if not for a dense coat of slime that lay all over the tile floor, in a shade halfway between engine-grease brown and viscera purple. Spatters of it adorned the lockers and walls as well, with drag marks to show where something huge had slid over the muck in serpentine ease down the abandoned corridor.   
*I’ve got to find a way to their scrap piles. Maybe the slime trails lead to the nest? After all, following bloody mutant fluid never got anyone killed, right?*  
Ignoring my own glum thoughts, I tried to avoid the majority of the goo on the floor, but it was no use. Soon my boots were covered in the stuff, and I had to keep one hand on the wall of lockers to my right in order not to fall. Small bones were scattered in various places over the floor, and I did my best not to look at them, as many resembled fingers, toes, and a few splayed hands. These crunched under my shoes, adding a sickening counter-effect to the squish-squish of the grease, and tickles of nausea threatened to resurge in my gut.  
I reached an intersection, and in the dark corridor to my right, something gurgled.  
Turning my head, I bit my tongue beneath the mask, and stifled a scream.  
Suspended in sticky folds of ebony ligaments, outstretched figures hung from the walls, lining both sides of the dilapidated hall like trophies in a hunter’s cabin. Some were completely covered in a horrific cocoon of veiny gray membrane, while others were merely secured by their four limbs in a spread-eagle position. None of them moved, but from the way they twitched, chest’s rising and falling in spasmodic jerks of involuntary respiration, left me with no doubt.  
*They’re still alive.*  
Most of them were Puppets, with mottled skin, white eyes wide open in frozen shock, knobby wooden teeth gaped in a muted scream of agony. But there were a few bodies that had pale, pinkish skin, wore more normal clothing, and even had some equipment on them. Gray-uniformed ELSAR soldiers, T-shirt wearing civilians, a few younger figures dressed as pirates, and toward the end of the hall, one or two captives adorned in ragged black polo shirts, all hung with silent despair for the entities that were wrapped around their torsos.  
They looked like slugs, woven from black sinews, and clutching to the ribs of each body with little nubby spines on their fat bellies. Each slug had its head buried into the flesh of its host, and it wriggled with greedy gulps, the entire length of the creature spasming as mouthfuls of blood slid down its gullet. Some were the size of a knapsack, and these were the ones wrapped like snakes around the more exposed people, while the others were so big, they had begun to form a cocoon of grayish-black flesh around themselves, their victims hollowed out like a dry corn husk. In the dim glow of my headlamp, the worms gleamed from the mucous that covered them, a single long spike on the tips of each one’s tail like a scorpion, and a chorus of gurgles spilled from their maws as they drained the life from each poor body.  
Mortified, I went to take a step back, and my shoe pressed down on an especially fat tendon buried in the slimy floor.  
*Squelch.*  
All the gurgles stopped, and somewhere overhead, the screech-thudding of the spiders paused, as if they too could sense the presence of an unwanted guest.  
I held my breath under the mask, too terrified to move.  
*That’s not good.*  
From deep within the mass of tortured corpses, a gray pod split, gushing fluid onto the floor, and an avalanche of black muscle tumbled out. It writhed for a few moments, and one end of the mass rose, big as a car engine, the entire length of the creature enough to stretch half of the corridor.  
Eight concave holes in the now smooth body twitched, as if to move legs it didn’t have yet, and the cavern of various pits in the ‘head’ sucked air like a vacuum cleaner. It swayed back and forth, tasting the air, and my mind reeled.  
This was why they needed the metal.  
The spiders were laying eggs . . . and their babies couldn’t walk, see, or call to each other without fresh scrap.  
*Sloosh.*  
In a spasmic, knee-jerk style reaction, the enormous Echo Pupae slid down the hall toward me, slithering in between the mass of hanging bodies and fellow larva, intent on making its first live kill.
