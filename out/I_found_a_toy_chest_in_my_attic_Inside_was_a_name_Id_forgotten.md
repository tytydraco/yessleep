My parents moved out of my childhood home a few months ago. In a generous gesture, they let me buy it from them.

It’s an old place. Outdated fixtures, old plumbing, wiring in parts of the ceiling - but it was familiar. I felt comfortable.

They didn’t leave me much. A couple of old wingback chairs, some pots and pans in the kitchen. That’s why, when I found the wooden toy chest in the attic, I didn’t think much of it.

Then I saw the shoebox.

It was at the bottom of the chest, with my name scribbled across the top in childish handwriting.

**BENNY.**

The name hit something in the back of my brain. Familiar, but not quite present.

I opened the box and spread the contents out across the attic floor.

First, there was an index card.

**The Rules**

1. Don’t tell Mom and Dad
2. He doesn’t like the closet
3. Always come back after hide and seek

Strange.

It felt like I should have known what it meant. Like something I only half-remembered.

There were also crayon drawings. Stick figures of me and another boy - one with a round head and a big smile. But I don’t remember having any friends named Benny. Not in school. Not ever.

I didn’t think much more of it at the time, and I put everything back.

But then the house started to change.

At first, it was just sounds. Not occasional creaks and groans either. I heard the patter of footsteps in the hallway. Wheels rolling across the attic floor. Once, I swear I heard a wind-up chime, like some old toy.

I told myself it was nothing.

But sometimes I’d get up and check around the house, just to be sure. But I never found anything.

Then came the shadows. Shadows that didn’t belong to me or anyone else. Things I’d catch in my peripheral vision - just a flicker, like someone was creeping around. Someone *watching.*

It got worse over the next few weeks.

Eventually, for my own sanity, I started talking to whatever the hell it was. At first, I tried to keep it light. Even funny.

“Yeah. Real cute. I know you’re messing with me.”

I knew it was probably just my imagination. But deep down, something felt…off.

Then it got worse.

I’d be making dinner, and I’d hear it - a giggle. A kid’s giggle. Close enough that I could sense it nearby.

That’s when I snapped.

“Okay, you little motherfucker. I’ve had enough.”

I probably needed help. But I wasn’t crazy. I wasn’t seeing things. I *knew* something was wrong.

I needed something I knew. Something normal to me. So I called my mom.

**“Mom. How’s the new place?”**

“Great! Your dad and I are happy. Couldn’t ask for nicer neighbors. How’s the old house?”

**“It’s… something.”**

“What do you mean, sweetie? Is it not what you thought?”

**“I don’t know, Ma. Strange things are happening.”**

“Oh. Well, once in a while you'd hear the occasional rumble here and there…”

**“Mom… who in the hell was Benny?”**

There was a pause. Then a nervous laugh.

**“Benny? Sweetie. Don’t you remember your own imaginary friend?”**

My stomach sunk. Of course. It all made perfect sense now.

Benny was the friend I never really had, but I made real. And the worst part?

I forgot him.

**“Yeah. I remember now, Mom. Just a passing thought. Love you. Gotta go.”**

I ended the call and sank into my armchair, heart racing.

**Benny.** How did I forget?

Then I heard it—a terrible *crash* upstairs. I ran up the steps and threw open the attic door. It was *freezing*. Middle of July, but I could see my breath.

I walked inside, looking around.

That’s when I saw it: the Scrabble box had fallen to the floor. But the noise I heard... it was loud…too loud. There was no way it could’ve been just that.

Then I looked down. The tiles were arranged on the floor, neatly.

**YOU PROMISED**

My throat closed. I wasn’t alone.

**“Benny?”**

A jack-in-the-box started winding.

**Whirr… click… whirr… click…**

Where the hell was it? I never owned one. I *hated* those things as a kid. Then I heard it. A whisper. Barely audible.

**“Olly olly oxen free…”**

I couldn’t move. My legs were jello. Then it hit me.

Hide and seek. That was our game all those years ago.

I had never come back. I had broken the third rule.

*"3. Always come back after hide and seek"*

**“Benny. If that’s you, I’m sorry, buddy. It’s been a long time. I know.”**

The floor gave out beneath me and I hit the ground hard. My vision was blurred. It took me a second to realize where I was.

The closet.

He put me in the closet.

That’s where I am now. Writing this. Waiting. My leg’s broken. I can’t move. I’ve been here for hours.

I didn’t follow the rules. I never came back.

And now?

Now Benny’s not letting me out.
