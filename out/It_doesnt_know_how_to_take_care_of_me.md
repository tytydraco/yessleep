My name is Joshua. I’m 43 years old. I used to live in rural Oregon, but approximately three months ago, I went missing.
I need the world to know what happened to me. I’m not sure how coherent or polished this will be, since I don’t have much time. I’ll just edit as I go.
To all of my loved ones who may be reading this, I suggest you stop here. I don’t want you to worry about me. But mostly, I don’t want these to be your final memories of me.
	
That day three months ago was perfectly dull and ordinary. I got home from work at about 6:00 pm, after a long commute to my house in the middle of nowhere. I took my shoes off, grabbed a beer from the fridge, and settled in on the couch to watch TV. 

Then came a rumbling. It was the second loudest noise I’ve ever heard in my entire life. My first thought was, EARTHQUAKE!  I could say it was like thunder. But, while thunder is loud, resonant, and sublime–as in the terrifying, overwhelming, godly sublime–it’s something you listen to at a comfortable distance. You can cozy up in your bed on a stormy night, knowing the storm raging outside can’t hurt you. But it was nothing like that. Nothing can describe the sound of the roof being ripped off your home. This was not the doing of a spirit, nor a faith, nor an incorporeal omnipresent being. It was a raw, physical thing, with stench and weight and wrinkles and such terrible enormity. But it might as well be a god, and it was here for me. 

The thing was larger than my house, perhaps twice over. Its body was a mass of knobbly joints. On the end of each appendage was a block of something like keratin or stone. I couldn’t count how many of these appendages it had. It was made of them, all arranged like a venus fly trap. Picture a hair clip, one of those claw-shaped ones, made of horse legs. That’s the best way I can try to describe it.
	
Then it pounced. It wrapped those many appendages around me, each as girthy as a redwood and with crushing power to match. My bare skin tingled wherever it touched. It had to have been corrosive, at least mildly, because those spots would develop into painful red rashes. The air in its grasp was suffocatingly acrid. The thing stunk horribly. The smell wasn’t putrid or rotten, but caustic. Bleach, ammonia, acetone—it smelled like poison, like something that would give me cancer. It stung my eyes and airways.

I was ripped from my home, lifted high, high up into the air, wind whipping all around me. The g-forces brutalized my body. Pressure expanded violently in my skull. I passed out.

I opened my eyes to complete darkness. Closed them, opened them again. It made no difference either way. My entire body hurt, but especially my head, which felt like it would explode at any second. Besides the throbbing in my ears, there was no sound. I ran my hand along the floor. It felt rough, porous, like pumice stone. I sat up slowly. The world was spinning. I realized I was hyperventilating. That’s probably why I felt so dizzy, I thought, so I tried a technique called “square breathing.” Inhale, hold for five seconds, exhale, repeat. Instinct told me to breathe faster; I wasn’t breathing enough.

What the fuck just happened to me?

I thought about that thing. How it smelled, how utterly helpless I was in its grasp. I thought it must have been a horrible dream. Then, out of any reaction my brain could produce in that moment, it pulled up ridicule. I think I’ve heard that line a thousand times in every movie, show, or book I’ve ever seen. “I must be dreaming,” the protagonist says, and the audience either rolls their eyes or doesn’t register the sentiment at all because of how cliche it is. But, in truth, that is what occurred to me at that moment. What happened to me could not have been real, because it was too insane. My brain didn’t evolve to process things like that.

I laid there for a while, waiting for something to happen. When nothing did, I stood up and wandered around. Groping around blindly in the dark, I felt a wall. I ran my fingers along its surface. It’s made of a substance unlike anything I’ve ever touched. My hands glide smoothly across its slippery surface, like it’s coated in oil, but it leaves no residue on my hands. Even the glossy smooth materials I’m familiar with have traction when you run your palms across them. Glass, plastic, porcelain. But not this stuff. When I knock on it, it rings hollow like wood, but it has no texture whatsoever.

I kept walking along the perimeter, feeling for a door, a window, anything. Nothing interrupted the unnatural perfection of these smooth walls. I didn’t come upon any corners, either, but I did get a subtle sense of curvature. My room is cylindrical. I couldn’t tell how big it was, though, nor did I know when I began making loops. So I took a tentative step away from the anchoring comfort of a solid surface, drifting toward the circle’s center.
A jolt of pain shot up my foot. I swore and lifted my leg. Gingerly, I ran my thumb along my sole, and touched the embedded object. It was a nail.
I had no idea what to make of that, but I knew I had to stay still. I didn’t know what was waiting for me out there.

I curled up on the floor. I ruminated there for a long time, repeating the catastrophe in my mind over and over. I tormented myself with the typical questions, the ones anyone would be asking in this situation. My logic paced in feverish circles.
Then I was blind. It bathed the room in burning, sterile white. This, too, was silent, unaccompanied by the “natural” sound of a light switch, or… anything. Without transition, it was summoned. I panicked, of course, thinking that thing had returned. It hadn’t; things were as still as ever. It took a second for my eyes to adjust, and instinctively, I looked up. The walls reached high above me and faded into darkness. I didn’t see the entity.

But I heard it.

The great monster made the air quiver like the deepest notes of a double bass cello. Or a whale song. I’ve heard before that the sheer sonic power of a whale song can kill you. I don’t know if that’s true, but it’s certainly true for this thing. The way I feel it resonate through my chest, rattling my bones—I truly believe it could rupture my organs if it got any louder. It’s gotten close a few times, I think. When it hummed, I felt such a sharp pain in my eardrums I thought they’d exploded, and a debilitating shock of anguish in my abdomen. I couldn’t even stand up straight after that. So I groveled, trembling on the floor. Another stretch of dread and waiting, I got up again and looked around. 

I live in a circle, maybe thirty feet in diameter. The walls and floor look how they feel. I began with only a few objects, standing starkly in blank space. A polyester blanket, a fake Christmas tree, a pile of two-by-fours, a pile of nails, a hammer. A pipe sticks out of the floor. It’s made out of the same material as the walls. I approached the pipe and cupped my hands underneath it. Freezing cold water flowed into my palms. The overflow dribbled onto the porous floor and drained away. With everything that had happened, I hadn’t realized how thirsty I was. I took a sip. It tasted like salt and dirty metal.
For the first few days, it only gave me salt water. That was when dehydration almost killed me, when the mucus in my throat felt like glue, when my piss came out as a brown syrup, when I could hardly form a coherent thought, let alone move. But, right before I could die of dehydration, it switched to fresh water. I felt better after the water switch, but I was still starving.

Frantic fluttering cut the silence, a hen clumsily flapping her wings. It descended from the abyss that looms above me, and landed on the floor. Again, I didn’t know what to make of that. 
Nothing happened for a long time, maybe a few days. My belly writhed and twisted, churning foamy bile, digesting itself. Was that what the chicken was for? Nothing else came down, so this was all I was going to get.
I hit it with a hammer until it died. I was so nauseous, but so hungry, so overwhelmed by the simultaneous instincts to eject and consume. I ate the chicken, raw and warm, and it made me shit blood.

After the first chicken made me sick, they sent another. This time, they also provided a gas station lighter. I didn’t kill this one. There was no way to cook it, anyway; no sharp tools to make kindling from the two-by-fours. When I tried to light it, it stubbornly charred a black spot in the wood, but didn’t ignite. There was no way I would try my chances again with raw bloody meat. So, I kept her alive and named her Pat. She wasn’t bad company. Her feathers were soft, and her adorable cooing sounds breathed life into the oppressive stillness.
If my food remains uneaten for too long, they remove it. It wasn’t long before they took her from me. I wasn’t shocked or dismayed when it happened, but her absence left an aching silence in my cell for the coming weeks.

Eventually it started to feed me other things. Raw potatoes, raw corn, hay, cereal.

This room has no ventilation, not even circulation of the same stale breaths festering stagnant in my cell.
The air here is also thin. I don’t think the atmosphere has enough oxygen. It reminds me of how it felt to breathe after I had Covid. I can heave as much as I want, and I’ll still feel exhausted. The dizziness, the delirium, it never ends. I don’t even know if my story is making sense so far. My head is swimming. I sometimes think I don’t even know what’s real anymore.
There’s no humidity here. I wake up every morning with chapped lips and a dry mouth. My eyes are sticky. My lungs shrivel with every gulp of air. The sandpaper ground has scraped off my soles.

There is another detail that bears mentioning. It does wound my dignity to talk about this, and I’m sure it’s not pleasant to hear, but if I omitted this, I would be glossing over a significant aspect of the sensory hell I find myself in.
My room has no toilet. Not even a bucket. The room started to fill with feces, both mine and the chicken’s. I, at least, have the sense to confine my waste to one area of the room, where I have to squat and do my business like a dog.

The thin air, the warmth, the stench, it all compounds into exponential torture. I have to fight for every shit-stinking breath.

The lights never turn off, either. I have no sense of time, no circadian rhythm, not a second where I’m not exposed. White room torture.
Would you believe me if I said the worst part is the boredom? Not just boredom, but isolation. The human brain needs interaction as much as it needs food and water. I’m really trying to flex my literary muscles here, because I need someone to know what it’s like, to experience even a fraction of a fraction of my misery. But I cannot describe to you the evil, gnawing thing that boredom is. My brain is atrophied because it was eaten up by the boredom. You can read this story in a few minutes. There is nothing that I can write in a single paragraph, or any number of paragraphs, to make you feel the way I feel every hour of every day, sitting in this little room.

One day, something new happened. It brought with it a surge of mortal terror so powerful I thought I’d keel over and die right there, but at least it wasn’t boring. The thing grabbed me while I was asleep. All over again, those enormous bony trunks closed in around me, stopping right before crushing my bones—it somehow knows when to stop squeezing. I gulped up its astringent reek. It pulled me into darkness, and again my stomach dropped, but it was gentler than the first time. It unfurled its many limbs, allowing me to stand. The pale light of my cell revealed its features.
It has grayish skin like an elephant. Wrinkles spread across the surface like cracks in asphalt. It's coated in a thin layer of tacky grease, like vaseline. Beyond it is a void. Miles below is certain death. I peeled my foot off the surface and took a wobbling step. The “ground” shifted beneath me and I tumbled forward. I caught myself, palms slapping its rough sticky hide. I still remember the bodily panic of falling. Like I was about to vomit my heart out. It prodded me, so I crawled forward. Imagine trying to climb up a tree while it’s moving, shifting around to accommodate your steps. Imagine scaling a living mountain.

I stared into the abyss. I had to know where I was, what world I’d been dragged into. My cell glowed in the distance, a perfect round dot the size of my thumbnail. It reminded me of the moon.
I looked back at the monster. My eyes ran along hundreds of feet of skin, dozens of limbs. I followed the length of its body until it disappeared like miles of highway. My eyes adjusted to the dim and began to form shapes out of darkness. There were more of these things out there, all branching from colossal pillars, all converging on a great planetary mass. The realization crawled up my spine and needled my brain.
I was standing on a hand.

This eldritch alien titan unceremoniously put me back in my room. Life resumed as if nothing ever happened.

It gives me more random items sometimes. A treadmill (that I can’t use, because it doesn’t have power,) a couple books written in languages I can’t read, dirty clothes that don’t fit me. Children' s clothes, XXL jeans, a cocktail dress, shoes with no matching pair. One day, for some inexplicable reason, it lowered a car into my cell: a silver honda civic. I couldn’t drive it, since there were no keys. One of the windows was broken, however, so I was able to crawl inside and manually unlock the doors. I’ve been using it as a shelter. I draped some fabric over the windows. I was finally allowed respite from the relentless glow. I sheltered in the cozy blanket of darkness for the first time in months. The car was a godsend. It was the best gift they’d ever given me.

I tried to kill myself with the hammer. All that did was give me a pounding headache, and probably a concussion. It was stupid, I know, but there were no other tools at my disposal. I might have actually succeeded if I put more force into it, but the human self-preservation instinct is stronger than my will. Maybe some part of me was holding out hope that I would be rescued. But I know that’s impossible. I’ll only be able to leave if my captor chooses to release me. Maybe it’ll grow bored of me one day. If that day comes, I pray they show me mercy.

I may not even live that long. My health declines more and more the longer I stay here. I’m not getting proper nourishment, sunlight, or oxygen. I don’t have my meds, either.

It gave me a smartphone. Somehow, by some miracle, it has an internet connection. I have no clue how that’s possible. Maybe it can manipulate electromagnetic fields or something, who the hell knows? But what it doesn’t have is a charger. I already called emergency services.
They can’t track my location. They said they would send people to look for me, but I’m not entirely sure I’m on Earth anymore. I don’t even know if I’m in the same dimension.
This phone is the only way to reach for the outside world. It is my anchor, my lifeline, my angel. It is slowly dying in my hands.

To my loved ones: I told you not to read this far, but if you did, I can’t blame you. I would do the same.
I already said all of this in my calls to you, but I want to immortalize it here, too.
Amelia and Eric, it was a joy to raise you two.
Eric, you’ve grown into such a talented artist. I know I said this a million times, but please never stop chasing your dreams. If you believe in yourself, you can make it anywhere you want. That cartoon show you dreamed of making? With your skills, I know you can make it happen. 
Amelia, congratulations on getting into law school. From the moment you could talk, I could tell you were going to be a fiercely brilliant person, and I was right. Strong, confident, intelligent—I’m amazed at the woman you grew up to be. I know you can kill it in a courtroom. Study hard, and you’ll be the best attorney in the state.
I can’t overstate how proud I am of both of you.

Scott, Katherine, and Mikey, you’re the best friends I could have ever hoped for. You had my back through thick and thin, so I just wanted to say, one last time, how much I love you guys.

My phone is on 2% now. I don’t have much time to wrap this up. Thank you for reading.
