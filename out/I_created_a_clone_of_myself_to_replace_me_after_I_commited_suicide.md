A few years ago, when I was feeling suicidal, I created a clone of myself to take my place after I commited suicide because I knew my family would feel guilty and blame themselves and I didn’t want them to go through that. 

The clone was exactly like me. He looked like me, acted like me and sounded like me. The only problem was, I was unable to make him age, get sick or die like a normal human but since this clone was me, I figured he’d surely think of a way to make himself look older as the years went by. 

Before finally offing myself, I installed a camera in my clone, booked myself into a hotel and watched how he was around my family for a week. 

For the first few days everything was going just as I wanted it to. It was like I was watching my everyday life through a screen. Nobody could tell the person they were interacting with was a clone.

On the fifth day I think it was though, the clone started acting differently. He was cheeky, insulting, just mean. On the sixth day, he started getting aggressive. He pushed my younger brother around and would break stuff. 

At this point I knew I had to intervene. I quickly drove home as fast as I possibly could. When I arrived, I saw my family huddled in the corner, crying and my clone standing over them holding a knife in one hand and the head of our dog in another hand. 

I ran at him, tackled him to the floor and ordered my family to run. They looked at me, confused. I told them I’d explain everything later but they needed to get out of there as quickly as they could so my dad picked up my little brother, took my mom’s hand and ran out to the car and drove off. 

I knew there was no way of beating him so I took the knife and ran away too. I drove to the lab I created him in and brainstormed solutions on how I could defeat my immortal clone. After about an hour of pacing around the lab trying to think of something I finally thought of something. I didn’t like the idea but it was the only thing I could think of. 

For the next few hours I built a device capable of stopping him and then drove to the nearest gun store and bought a pistol. When I reached my house again my clone was nowhere to be seen. I searched all over the neighborhood for him. It was only when I heard on the local radio “madman on a killing spree in the local Supermarket. Unable to be killed by police”  I knew where to find him. 

When I reached the supermarket there were cops everywhere. I put up my hood so they wouldn’t recognise me if they saw me and sneaked in one of the back entrances. My clone was in the center of the supermarket, holding a knife and covered in blood. There were dead bodies all over the floor and about 20 cops shooting at him. I saw a few try to run at him at once but he was too quick for them and slit their throats in the space of about 5 seconds. 

The only way this was going to work is if I sneaked up behind him and put the device on the back of his neck. I used pillars in the supermarket as cover and the sound of the gunshots to cover the sound of my footsteps approaching him. When I finally got behind him, I turned on the device, put the pistol in his pocket and stuck the device on the back of his neck. This caused the both of us to pass out for a second. When I woke up, I was now in his body and he was in mine. I took the pistol and shot him in the head, killing my clone in my real body instantly. 

The cost of killing myself was immortality.
