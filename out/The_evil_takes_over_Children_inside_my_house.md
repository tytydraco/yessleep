I woke up to the sound of scratching at my bedroom window. It was a strange noise that I had never heard before. At first, I thought it was just the wind blowing some branches against the glass, but as the scratching continued, I knew it was something else.


I slowly got out of bed and made my way to the window. When I looked outside, I saw nothing but darkness. The scratching had stopped, but I still felt uneasy. I tried to shake it off and went back to bed, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.


The next night, the scratching came back. This time it was louder, more persistent. I got up to look outside again, but still saw nothing. I was starting to feel like I was going crazy. I tried to tell myself it was just my imagination, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was out there.


Over the next few days, the scratching continued. I started to notice other strange things happening around my house. Items would go missing, only to reappear in strange places. I heard footsteps in the hallway when I knew I was the only one home. Sometimes, I would catch a glimpse of a figure out of the corner of my eye, but when I turned to look, it was gone.


One night, I woke up to the sound of laughter. It was a child's laughter, but it was coming from inside my house. I got up to investigate, but as I walked down the hallway, the laughter faded away. When I got to the living room, I saw a little girl sitting on my couch. She had long, dark hair and was wearing a white dress. She was staring straight ahead, not acknowledging me at all.


"Hello?" I said, trying to get her attention. She didn't respond. I took a step closer and that's when I noticed her eyes. They were completely black, no pupils or whites, just blackness.


I screamed and ran back to my bedroom, locking the door behind me. I could hear the laughter again, but it was growing louder and more manic. I knew I had to get out of the house, so I climbed out of my window and ran to my car. As I pulled out of the driveway, I looked back at my house and saw something that made my blood run cold.


There was a figure standing in my bedroom window. It was tall and thin, with long, twisted limbs. Its eyes were also completely black, and it was smiling at me with a mouth full of sharp teeth.


I drove as fast as I could, not stopping until I reached a hotel miles away from my house. I didn't sleep that night, but I did some research. What I found terrified me even more than the creature I had seen.


There have been reports of demons known as the Black-Eyed Children. They are said to be young children or teenagers with completely black eyes who try to gain entry to people's homes, asking to use their phone or bathroom. Those who let them in often end up dead or missing.


The more I read, the more I realized that what I saw was not just a random occurrence. The Black-Eyed Children were after me.


A few days later, I received a knock on my hotel door. It was a little girl, with long dark hair and a white dress. She looked innocent enough, but when I looked into her eyes, I saw the same blackness that had terrified me before.


"Can I come in?" she asked in a sweet, innocent voice.


I knew what she was and I refused to let her in. But then I heard another voice, this time from outside my window.


"Let us in," it whispered. "We just want to play."


I looked out the window and saw more of them, the Black-Eyed Children, standing in the darkness. They were all staring at me with their empty, black eyes.


I was frozen with fear, not knowing what to do. They continued to whisper, begging me to let them in, promising that they just wanted to play. But I knew better, I knew what they were capable of.


I closed my eyes and tried to block out their voices, but it was no use. They continued to whisper, their voices growing louder and more insistent.


Suddenly, I felt a sharp pain in my chest. It was like someone had plunged a knife into my heart. I opened my eyes and saw the little girl with the black eyes standing in front of me. She had a wicked smile on her face, as if she was enjoying my pain.


I tried to scream, but no sound came out. The pain was unbearable, and I could feel myself slipping away. As I started to lose consciousness, I saw the Black-Eyed Children enter my hotel room, their eyes fixed on me.


The next thing I knew, I was waking up in a hospital bed. The doctors told me that I had suffered a massive heart attack, and that it was a miracle that I had survived.


But something was different about me. Sometimes I felt like I was no longer in control of my own body. I would have these moments where I would feel a surge of anger or aggression, and I would lash out at those around me. It was like a creeping darkness was slowly taking hold of me, consuming me from within.


At first, it was just a faint feeling, a distant ache that seemed to grow stronger with each passing moment. But soon, it became unbearable, like someone was tearing me apart from the inside.


I screamed out in pain, my body writhing on the bed as I felt something foreign take over. My limbs contorted and twisted, bones cracking and shifting in ways that should have been impossible.


And then, it happened. My eyes, once a deep shade of brown, began to change. The whites turned black, and the pupils expanded until they filled my entire eye sockets. I felt a surge of energy coursing through me, a power that was not my own.


As I looked down at my hands, I saw that they were no longer mine. They were pale, almost translucent, with long, spindly fingers that ended in razor-sharp claws. My entire body was changing, becoming something otherworldly and grotesque.


And then, just as suddenly as it began, it was over. I lay there on the bed, my body still twitching and convulsing, but the transformation was complete. I was now one of them, a Black-Eyed Child.


I tried to scream, to fight against the evil that now consumed me, but it was no use. My mind was no longer my own, and my body was a puppet for their dark desires.


I stumbled out of the hospital room, my eyes fixed on the unsuspecting people around me. I could feel their fear, their unease, and it only made me stronger.


And so, I now roam the earth as one of the Black-Eyed Children, searching for new vessels to inhabit, new victims to torment. I am no longer myself, but a monster born from their darkness.


Beware, dear reader, for the Black-Eyed Children are real, and they are always watching. And if they choose you as their next victim, there is no escape from their grasp.
