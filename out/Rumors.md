I'm Ryan. Ryan Turner. I work as a manager at a burger joint. Which one isn't important. They're all the same, anyway. The time is currently 9:41pm, Tuesday. I am 32 years old, and have lived down the street from here my whole life. "Here" is the southwest corner of Boll St. and Anton St., in the basement of the library. 

With me is Isaac Gar, 13 years of age. A pale, skinny kid with a scar on his lip. Born 2011.3.15, down south in Los Angeles. If he makes it out, if someone reads this, find his aunt. Get him back to LA. Away from here. 

One thing you should know about me is that I'm... strange. Not in presence, mind you. But I have an ability. To manipulate people's minds. Make them think certain ways or do certain things. Classic Hollywood mind control. With a thought and a flick of my hand, I can make someone tell me the truth as they know it. Make them believe every word I say and follow my every command to a T. And they'd never even know it wasn't them. 

I'll tell you something now. When someone says they'd pick mind control over any other superpower, they're either misguided or morally grey. Because mind control isn't a good thing to have. Making someone do something they wouldn't really want to do, that's wrong. But that's not important right now. 

What is important is that we might not make it out of this library. And it's my fault. I made this kid take me to his parents. But I never asked if they were okay. And he never got the chance to tell me. Not until we were here. Trapped. 

If you live around the Bay Area, you probably heard the rumors. Rumors about some backwoods town an hour southeast. Rumors of people going missing. 

Maybe you heard the more outlandish rumors. Rumors of monsters lurking in the darkness. Rumors of prowlers in the silence of night. Rumors of something taking people into the library. 

I heard the rumors, obviously. But they're just rumors. Monsters aren't real. And a serial killer or mugger isn't exactly a threat to me. I'm safe. So I started investigating the rumors. Trying to find the kernel of truth in them. 

And I found this kid. Isaac. Not by searching the news or anything. Just in the street. He told me he needed help, and I asked where. *Asked* him to take me there. So he did. 

He brought me to the library. The doors were unlocked. They always are. The library got tired of replacing the windows on either side of the doorway, so they gave up. No one does anything, just breaks the windows. The library used to hang some more political posters there, and our small town people disagreed. Even in California, not everyone believes in public schooling or anti-discrimination policy. 

Isaac took me inside. He didn't hesitate. He couldn't. I took away that choice when I told him to take me there. So in we went. 

The lights don't work. We tried. When I called out into the dark, I got no response. We walked further in, Isaac shaking but not slowing. I think he was crying, but I wasn't paying attention right then. 

Because I could hear something else. Whispering. Like a high school clique gossiping behind my back. Spreading rumors. 

I shouted out into the library. Commanded the voice to make itself known. The whispering didn't stop, but something moved in the dark above us. Now that I knew where it was, I could command it more easily, but my next attempt yielded no result. Whatever this thing was, I had no control over it. 

Then it knocked down a shelf of books, so I grabbed Isaac and ran. I've been in this library plenty of times, researching monsters and old unsolved murders, and I managed to take us straight to this basement. 

That's when I asked where Isaac's parents were. Not in the half hour walk to get there, not in the eerie stillness of the library, but now, pinned underground by a monster. He replied simply, voice wavering and hesitant. I wasn't going to make him talk. But he did. 

"They're gone. *They* took them."

...

My name is Ryan Turner. It's currently 10:56pm, Tuesday. Still in the basement. We started hearing the whispers again about half an hour ago. Rumors spoken through the door. A few minutes ago, Isaac started whispering, too. Rumors about the monsters, about the library. Rumors about his parents. I don't think he could see me for a bit. I made him stop and explain. 

He couldn't answer. Not that he was too emotional or anything, because that wouldn't stop my control. But he didn't know. He didn't remember. Anything. Not accurately. Just the rumors. That something took his parents to the library. That a monster lives on the corner of Boll and Anton. 

Then he went back to whispering. And I realized something. I'm not the only thing in this town that can mess with your head. 

...

My name is Ryan Turner. The time is 5:12am, Wednesday. I am in a basement on the southeast corner of Boll and Anton. Under the library. With me is Isaac Gar. A skinny kid with a scar. He's not well. I'm not sure I am, either. 

The things keep trying the door. Turning the handle. And whispering their rumors. I'm making Isaac sit in the corner with a box in his hands. He'd go open the door if I wasn't here to stop him. His whispering hasn't stopped. 

One hour to sunrise. If we can just make it to sunrise, we'll be free. I know it. Just one hour to sunrise. 

...

The time is now 6:21am, Wednesday. I am Ryan Turner, 32 years old. I work at a burger joint. I don't remember which one. Or my address. My middle name. I hope these things will come back to me once I get some sleep. Once I get away from these whispers. These rumors. 

Rumors that I'm insane. Rumors that I'm dead. Rumors that I never existed at all. Hearing the things say it isn't easy, but hearing the kid say it is rough. I had to convince him I wasn't undead a bit ago. 

Holding on to myself is harder by the minute. But the sun is rising. At least, it should be. The whispers are getting softer, weaker. But more desperate. Angry. Isaac is getting agitated, but he can't get up from his corner while I'm here. 

I've never been religious. But I got pretty familiar with a lot of religions while I researched monsters. I've spent a lot of my time down here praying to every diety I could think of. Praying that I survive. That I can go home. That the rumors aren't true. That I'm not dead. 

...

My name is Ryan Turner. I am 32. I am in a room in the police station on First and Main. Isaac is on the other side of the wall to my right. Someone, a detective or something, is behind the mirrored glass. Watching me write. They think I'm insane. I know because they said so. Because I asked. One rumor that's true. 

They say I'm not dead. And I must exist to be not dead. So that's two rumors false. Probably. 

The time is 8:04am, Wednesday. I am alive. I am leaving this town as soon as they let me out of this station. I will not stay another night. I can't. Can't risk another rumor coming true.
