I didn’t leave the office.

I told myself I should. I told myself I’d already crossed a line I couldn’t uncross. But my legs wouldn’t cooperate.

The computer screen had gone black. My reflection sat in it, washed out and wrong. Like something that looked like me but wasn’t.

I kept seeing the same words from the files in my head, over and over..

Presence.  
Attention.

Continuous human presence required.

Not rent. Not maintenance. Not security.

Presence.

I reached for the mouse again.

The screen woke up with a thin blue glow. The cursor hovered over folder labeled CONTINUITY.

I clicked it.

The list came up again.

Every unit in the building. Neat column. Status colors like traffic lights. Green, yellow, red.

I had already seen the color coding. STABLE. DEGRADED. VACANT.

What I hadn’t noticed before was the way the list was laid out.

Each unit had a small arrow beside it. A dropdown.

History.

I clicked Unit 2A without thinking.

A panel opened on the right.

It was formatted like a performance chart.

CONTRIBUTION START  
BASELINE LOAD  
ATTENTION VARIANCE  
DURATION  
FINAL STATUS

The earliest entry went back decades.

And it had a name.

Not a code. Not an ID. A full name, typed as cleanly as the unit number.

Below it, another name.

Below that, another.

Three people. Same unit. Different years.

The final column didn’t say “Moved Out.”

It said:

EXHAUSTED.

I stared at it until my eyes started to sting.

The word didn’t belong in a building file. Exhausted is what you write in a report after an accident.

Not next to an apartment.

I clicked Unit 3C.

Seven names.

Final statuses: WITHDRAWN. EXHAUSTED. EXHAUSTED.

I clicked Unit 4D.

Two names. One of them had a duration listed in weeks, not months.

Final status: TERMINATED.

My stomach tightened hard at that one.

I clicked another.

Then another.

The pattern didn’t change.

Contribution. Decline. End.

Nothing about moving. Nothing about leaving.

Just a system tracking how long a person could hold steady.

I sat back in the chair and tried to breathe slowly through my nose.

This couldn’t be what it looked like.

It had to be some awful internal shorthand. Some weird software designed by a property management company that thought it was clever.

But the words were too specific. Too consistent.

And the more I clicked, the more it started feeling like a machine doing exactly what it was built to do.

I scrolled back up to the top of the Continuity page.

I found my apartment:

2B

And clicked the arrow.

For a second nothing happened.

Then the screen lagged, like it had to load more than it was used to showing at once.

A new page opened.

UNIT 2B  
STATUS: OCCUPIED  
CONTINUITY HOLD: STABLE

And beneath that… a structure I hadn’t seen on any other unit.

It wasn’t one list.

It was several.

The first section was what I expected:

CURRENT CONTRIBUTOR

ACTIVE — ADEQUATE  
Contribution increasing  
Attention variance rising  
Memory stability declining

Contributor. Like I was doing a job without clocking in.

There was another section under it, labeled:

ANCHOR HISTORY

The page expanded automatically as if the system expected someone to open it.

Name. Start. Duration. Final Status.

The first name on the list was familiar. I stared at it. Then it hit me.

The man who used to take the stairs.

I remember the way he moved: steady, careful, like he didn’t trust the elevator. Tall. Greying hair. Always a quiet nod when we passed on the landing.

I hadn’t seen him in months.

I had told myself he moved.

There were more names below his.

One of them made me sit forward so fast the chair scraped the floor.

The woman whose door used to slam late at night.

The way her footsteps hit the hall when she was angry. The way she cried once on the stairs with her head in her hands, whispering into her phone.

Then she stopped.

Just… stopped.

The dates beside her name were blocks of time.

Contribution Start. Decline Onset. Final Status.

And her final status was:

WITHDRAWN.

As if you could remove someone from a system once their value was spent.

I scrolled further down.

More names.

A lot more.

The list continued past the edge of the screen.

Different decades. Different formatting.

Some were typed in crisp modern font.

Some looked like they’d been imported from older systems. Weird spacing. Different date style.

And then, further down, the entries changed again.

The names were still there, but the structure of the file shifted, like I’d scrolled into an earlier “version” of the same record.

Then I saw a summary, like a version control..

VERSION 19  
MIGRATION COMPLETE

VERSION 33  
ANCHOR PROTOCOL UPDATED

VERSION 47  
CONTINUITY MODEL REVISION

They had upgraded the way they tracked this, over and over, what must have been a very long time.

I scrolled until my finger cramped.

Names. Names. Names.

Some lasted years.

Some lasted months.

Final Status.

EXHAUSTED.  
WITHDRAWN.  
REASSIGNED.  
TERMINATED.

There was another column I hadn’t paid attention to because my eyes kept snagging on the names.

ASSIGNED UNIT

I assumed it would say 2B for everyone, because I was in Unit 2B’s file.

But when I actually looked…

It didn’t.

For the man who used to take the stairs:

ASSIGNED UNIT: 2B

For the woman with the slammed door:

ASSIGNED UNIT: 2B

And then further down—

ASSIGNED UNIT: 4C  
ASSIGNED UNIT: 7A  
ASSIGNED UNIT: 5D

Different units.

All listed under the Anchor History.

I scrolled up and down again, faster.

But it was consistent.

These people weren’t “previous tenants of my apartment.”

They lived elsewhere in the building.

But were assigned to 2B anyway.

Like a resource being moved where it was needed.

I read the header again:

ANCHOR HISTORY

And that word I’d been trying not to say out loud finally formed properly in my head.

Anchor.

Unit 2B wasn’t just another apartment in the list.

It wasn’t even the most stable one.

It was the unit the system cared about in a different way.

My hands started to shake so badly I had to put my palms flat on the desk.

I tried to breathe.

I tried to slow down.

I told myself: you are spiraling. You are reading too much into admin language. You are sleep-deprived and terrified and turning spreadsheets into monsters.

But the next section on the page killed that argument.

It was labeled:

FEEDER CONTRIBUTION (BUILDING-WIDE)

A list populated underneath it.

Unit numbers.

Percentages.

Time blocks.

And beside them: names.

Not everyone. Not on every unit.

Just certain people. Certain time spans.

Feeder units. Holding units. People who contributed in small pieces and then dropped off the list.

I clicked on one.

A file opened.

It was shorter than the Anchor logs.

But the notes were the same kind of language I’d already seen.

Routine irregular.  
Attention drop.  
Occupant instability.

Then a line that made my throat tighten.

Reassignment initiated — anchor support required.

Anchor support.

I backed out of the file and clicked another.

Same structure.

Different person.

Different unit.

Same endpoint.

Reassigned.

It wasn’t one apartment doing this.

It was the whole building arranged like a system.

Unit 2B at the center.

Everything else feeding into it when it needed reinforcement.

And suddenly I thought back to the tenant sheet in the lobby.

My unit listed as occupied.

But no name next to it.

Because it wasn’t a home in the way a home is supposed to be.

And as long as something filled it and performed the right routines, the building didn’t care who you were.

I stared at my own “Current Contributor” entry again.

ACTIVE — ADEQUATE

And beneath it, a line I hadn’t noticed earlier because my eyes had been drowning in names.

Projected exhaustion window: 14–21 months

I read it twice.

Then a third time, slower, like if I took my time it might change.

It didn’t.

The system had already decided I had a shelf life.

Another tab blinked at the bottom of the screen.

REPLACEMENT PIPELINE

My mouth went numb.

I clicked it.

A new list opened.

SOURCE UNIT  
NAME  
COMPATIBILITY  
STATUS

The first entry was already filled in.

SOURCE UNIT: 4C  
COMPATIBILITY: HIGH  
STATUS: READY

There was a name next to it.

A real name.

Not mine.

Someone currently living in the building.

Someone going about their day, checking their mail, nodding in hallways, taking stairs or elevators without ever knowing they’d been tagged like this.

Ready.

Like a part waiting in inventory.

I felt something break loose in my chest, a small, ugly sound that might have been a laugh if it hadn’t come out so thin.

They weren’t planning to evict me.

They weren’t planning to punish me.

They weren’t even planning around me at all.

They were planning around Unit 2B.

Around the anchor.

Around the thing that needed continuous human presence to stay stable.

And I wasn’t the important part of it.

I looked at the Anchor History again. The names I recognized. The names I didn’t.

I thought about how easily people disappear in a building like this.

How quickly you stop noticing a face you used to see every week.

How simple it is to tell yourself: they moved.

I sat there in that dim office, the monitor humming quietly, and it finally landed in full.

These people didn’t leave.

It didn’t even mark them as missing.

It updated their status, rebalanced the load, and started the next cycle.

ACTIVE — ADEQUATE

Adequate.

Like a battery that still holds a charge.

Like a machine component that hasn’t failed yet.

I don’t know how long I sat there before I realized my mouth was open.

Before I realized I was whispering, without meaning to.

“I’m not special.”

No one answered.

The office stayed quiet.

The building stayed quiet.

And somewhere under all of it, under the concrete and the levels that weren’t on any public plan, something kept pressing upward. Patient, constant, while the system above it made sure it never had to come through.

Because it didn’t need me to survive.

They just need someone to take my place.

And they already know who comes after me.
