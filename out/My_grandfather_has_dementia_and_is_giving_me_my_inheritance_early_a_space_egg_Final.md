I found myself back in the study.  The bulb had finally died, and the room was lit only by the kitchen light that seeped in behind me from the open doorway.  My phone had an operator on the line asking for more details as it hung loosely in my hand.  All energy was gone, and my head felt like it was splitting.  I couldn’t answer any more questions.  The faint static voice mentioned an ambulance was on its way before I hung up.  Alone, I stood over the cradle of my inheritance.  He seemed so at peace, his body still absorbing the heat of the rock he cherished.  Numbly, I squatted down in front of the chair to get a better look at his vacant face.  Satisfaction.  But something else lingered on it, too.  Remorse.  

I felt the note crinkle in my pocket.  The title of his letter resurged in my mind.  *Inheritance*.  It held my gaze like a beacon in that dark room.  I basked in it for a moment, pulsing with its touch.  My headache dimmed with each minute in front of it.  I needed its warmth.  My father’s words of warning blurred away as I reached down to the stone.  Before I could stop myself, my finger touched it.  I never felt more ok.  That warmth fills you, it blankets you inside and out.  The smoothness of the meteorite swelled within me an almost sensual pleasure.  It felt like sliding my hands on the bare skin of a lover for the first time.  Not just a lover, a soul mate.  The visage of remorse that was inscribed on my grandfather’s cold face jolted me back to my senses.  I pulled away in shock.  

Catching my breath, I decided to go to the kitchen and remain there until the ambulance came.  As I left, I turned to consume the sight of it one more time.  I froze.  The silhouette of my grandfather’s corpse accentuated the rock perfectly in the sliver of light creeping from the open doorway.  It looked… slightly larger than even before.  I broke into a cold sweat as the words of the note, my grandfather’s final testament, reemerged in my mind:

*It has grown hungrier.*

Shaking off my paranoia, I slammed the door behind me and went into the light of the hollow house, waiting for the EMTs to arrive and maybe calm my nerves.  The touch haunted me, the sensation replayed through my mind and body in a cycle I couldn’t control.  I sat cradling myself on the kitchen floor, a single thought dominating me.  *I wonder how blissful it felt to hold it like Grandpa did*.  I was no longer worrying about where my grandma was or how my Dad would react to the death of his father.  Now, all I could think about was how jealous I was of my grandfather.  I saw the ambulance pull up, lights blaring, through the window.  

I led them to the study, informed them of all I knew, and they said they would keep in touch with me.  I hurried out of the house, glad they hadn't been suspicious of the tote bag I had carried out with me.  The familiar weight of it alone filled me with a euphoria I could barely contain as I got into my car.  

I drove off, bag in the passenger seat.  Guilt, shame, and confusion rallied against me, as long as my hand was off the bag at least.  The long drive home produced a cycling war in my head that I could not avoid.  Grief was the only emotion that dominated throughout it.  My migraine returned with a blinding force with each passing minute.  The drug that grew next to me was the only coping mechanism I could utilize on that long car ride.  Towards the end of the journey, my hand was firmly planted on it.  

The following days were a blur of mournful calls and depressing legal conversations about wills, property, etc.  My Dad didn’t take it well.  Despite our conversation a couple of days prior, I could tell he still thought Grandpa had a few more years left.  I did too.  A funeral came and went, my grandma seemed oddly stoic, but I saw a pit in her eyes.  Perhaps she expected this.  Maybe she knew something that I didn’t.  I never got to have that last talk with Grandpa in the end, but I did receive my inheritance.  It got me through those horrid first couple of weeks.  Then the next month.  Now over a year has passed.  I don’t have it in a safe; I’ve grown too reliant on it to keep it locked up.  Every time I set it down, alarms blared in my thoughts as my crippling migraine worsened with each use of it.   Each time it would come harder and faster than before, all the while I would stare at the egg's increased size.  They go away eventually, once my willpower is weakened and I find myself cradling it again.  The grief that remained present, even when holding the egg, has been replaced by a growing fear.  Even when consumed by its radiance, it sits in the back of my mind.  My father’s words are growing more meaningful with every session with the rock:

 *I steered clear of that ‘egg’ ever since.  You should, too.*

I never could get rid of it.  A part of me did consider it a family heirloom gifted to me before he passed.  It was a part of him in a sense.  And I couldn’t throw him away.  My headaches have escalated beyond recovery.  The moment I put it down now, my head splits in half.  I haven’t been able to see my family for several months now, or I think a year?  Time has been slipping by me.  My Dad tried visiting a couple of weeks ago, I think.  I had to cut the reunion short due to my aching head.  I told him I was feeling sick or something along those lines as an excuse.  I don’t know if I was paranoid, but the look he gave me was… telling.  There's no way he knows I have it.  Can’t know.  

I had to start working from home with a new job that pays less, but I don’t care.  It’s got me, I’m too far gone now.  I wonder if this was how bad it was for Grandpa?  Or maybe it wasn’t as hungry as before?  It keeps growing.  More rapidly each day.  I think I know why now.  It grew up WITH my Grandpa, it consumed what little it could in passing.  I am a full-grown adult; there is much more to have and immediately.  

The fear has grown with each moment I hold that egg; its immense size covers my whole lap now.  The bliss I feel isn’t enough to stifle the voice screaming in the back of my head.  I don’t know if I will be enough for it to hatch, but I pray to God I’m not.  This egg dies with me, and I know I will die with that same twisted look of bliss and remorse on my face.  I don’t believe it's the second coming; all I know is that it is my end.  I now know what it consumes as well, now.

I noticed some signs of it, but I thought little of it as it was between sessions of cradling my egg.  Even when it's yourself, I guess the instinct is to not realize, or not take heed to what few signs you do notice.  I finally forced myself to get examined, driving to the doctor with that egg next to me, sticking out of the tote bag it once fit snuggly in, now almost tearing its seams.  

My head throbbed the whole appointment, my thoughts tied to the image of the rock in my car and the relief that would be coming soon.  Until they were rudely pulled away to the reality I had pathetically been blind to until now.  

The doctor confirmed a couple of days later, over the phone I had signs of early-onset dementia.  That it could end up being aggressive for someone who was still otherwise relatively young.  I haven’t told my family, and I don’t plan to until the time is right.  I wrote all this down while I still am able, and I hope that if you guys find it, you can forgive me.  I have maybe another year of being coherent.  I know the doctor said I had longer, but he doesn’t know.  This egg I have on my lap, throbbing, gestating off the nutrients of my Grandfather’s mind, and now mine, will be dying with me.  Whatever is growing inside can’t be allowed out.  I love you, Mom, Dad, Chris, Blake, and Phil.  I loved you, Grandpa; nothing about this changes that.  And I hope you were right.  

I hope to see you at the end of time.
