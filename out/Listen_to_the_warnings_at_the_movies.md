I had a weird experience at the movies yesterday and wanted to share it on the internet as a bit of a PSA. Essentially, you really should read the warnings that come on before the movie.

I go to my local theater pretty often. It’s close to my house and I like the popcorn. Naturally when I was bored with nothing to do yesterday I walked over there.

There was only one movie showing that I hadn’t already seen. I hadn’t heard of it before, but I wasn’t in the mood to rewatch a movie. I bought a ticket, got my popcorn, and sat down in the theater.

I really wish I remembered what the movie was called, but I’m horrible with names. I kind of recall what it was about, some cheesy rom-com about young adults falling in love in college biology class. I was wondering if the theater was doing some kind of nostalgia event because the thing felt like it came out 25 years ago. If they were it wasn’t well-attended, only a handful of people were in the theater with me.

The above-mentioned warning came on after the standard “be quiet and don’t record the movie” clip. It was just a black screen with white text that went something like this:

NOTICE: LEAVING THE THEATER WHILE THE FILM IS PLAYING IS AGAINST THEATER POLICY. VIOLATORS WILL BE ESCORTED OUT OF THE BUILDING.

A voice read the text out as well, and I guess the addition of the warning had been rushed because she tripped over her words when she read “leaving”.

I didn’t think much of it at the time, I figured some teens had been goofing off in the theater hallway or something. Around an hour into the film, I really had to pee. I remembered the warning but thought if I wasn’t being disruptive I wouldn’t get in trouble. I mean, they wouldn’t ban going to the bathroom would they?

So I left, taking note of which theater I was in (theater 3). I went to the bathroom, and walked back.

The theater wasn’t there. Like I said, I go to the movies a lot so I know the building layout well. Where theater 3 was supposed to be was instead “theater C”. I had never seen a theater C in this building before, only theaters 1-4. I wondered if maybe they’d changed it without my noticing, and tried the door to “theater C” but it was locked.

I walked around for a bit looking for theater 3 and quickly noticed more things that were out of place. For starters, there was no trash. Nothing in the trash cans, no popcorn spilled on the floor. The place was pristine. It was cold too, real cold. Outside it was like 90° F, and I knew the theater AC hadn’t been this intense when I came in.

The most damning thing though, was the lack of an exit. No ticket or popcorn stand either, just a couple hallways with doors to various impossible theaters. I was starting to panic, and tried all the doors. None of them opened.

“How are they going to escort me out if there’s no exit,” I thought hysterically, and chuckled a little. It came out louder than I expected and echoed through the hall.

Immediately, I heard footsteps behind me. I tried to turn around, but before I could a frigid hand wrapped its fingers around my shoulder and pulled me back. I jerked away and spun to see what was there.

I was a man, I think. Definitely a person. I didn’t see any specific features, his outstretched hand distracted me. His fingers were blackened and swollen, horribly frostbitten. He lurched forward, grasping for my shoulder again, and I jumped back, turned, and ran like my life depended on it.

Half-stumbling through the hall, I could hear footsteps behind me. The temperature kept dropping, freezing air bit my lungs when I gasped for air. I wasn’t sure how long I could keep running for.

Right as I was about to collapse, an arm burst from the wall beside me. It beckoned toward me and without thinking I took it, it yanked me into the wall. We crashed through like it was paper, and behind was a door marked exit. I pushed it open, and stepped aside so my rescuer could follos. After a couple seconds passed without anyone exiting I glanced through the door to see what was happening.

There was nobody there. The credits were rolling in front of the empty seats of theater 3. I was standing outside, having gone through an emergency exit.

My legs ached but I didn’t know what to so I just walked back home.

I don’t know what exactly happened. I don’t know if it was the theater or something else that did it. I don’t know if it was legal. I was warned, I guess.

In any case I’m not going back to the theater. I’d advise all of you to read the warnings when, or if, you go to the movies.
