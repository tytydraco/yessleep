Here's the link to part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mh6dy2/i\_thought\_angels\_were\_in\_my\_walls\_part\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mh6dy2/i_thought_angels_were_in_my_walls_part_1/)



There was a moment as I walked through the front door that I didn’t hear the scratching in the walls, that I thought my forgiveness had cured my haunting, but within a few moments it returned as they registered my arrival. I made my way around the flat and checked the bowls I had left out. *Full, full, full.* All of them were untouched. Clearly these angels didn’t have a taste for cereal. Deciding that there wasn’t much I could do about them, I went about my day. 

I began to pile up my textbooks onto the coffee table, gently pushing aside the bibles I had laid out the night before. Slipping on headphones, I started the assigned reading that I had missed for the last 3 lectures. Every paragraph seemed to drag on and on. I found myself glancing around the room, desperate to focus on anything even remotely more interesting. 

Within half an hour, I had given up, instead choosing to watch a long video on a film I had never watched. *Daniel would have studied. Daniel would have been on top of this*. I tried to shoo those thoughts, but the guilt of failure still sat heavy on my chest. That weight left me trapped watching video after video until my evening slipped away. 

When I finally got up to go make dinner, the stack of textbooks had only served as an eyesore. 

I decided on a simple dinner. I went through the motions blindly, following a pattern I had done many nights before. Heat up the pan, defrost some buns, slice the cheese and the tomato and the- My finger was bleeding onto the cutting board. 

“Ah! Goddammit!” Hissing as my finger began to throb, I shook out the bleeding hand and scurried to the bathroom. The cut wasn’t deep, just enough to bleed all over my sleeve. I rummaged around one-handedly trying to find the old box of plasters. After three different drawers and cupboards I managed to pull out the beaten box. By the time it was secured my finger was only distantly aching. I left the mess of open drawers in the bathroom and quickly hurried back to the kitchen to check the stove. 

Luckily, the patties were still sizzling happily. I went back to my, surprisingly clean,  cutting board and continued preparing dinner. 

“Goddammit.” *No. Please not again*. The voice came from the lounge. I went back to chopping the lettuce. 

“God-” From the hallway this time. I moved my fingers further from the trembling knife in my other hand. 

“Forgive me, for taking the Lord’s name in vain. Amen.” I whispered it to myself, too afraid to try and say it to the angels watching. I could hear murmurs further in the flat, but I couldn’t distinguish what they were saying. I didn’t move my eyes from the lettuce in my hand, studying every drop of water settled on the leaves. I didn’t move until I stopped hearing that murmuring. I went back to preparing dinner in silence. 

After dinner, lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling listening to the angels scurry through. *I wonder why they stay in the walls.* The noise kept me wired and awake for a long time. I slowly drifted off thinking about what they did while I slept. 

Rebbekah was already waiting for me as I walked in to my lecture the next morning. I slunk into the seat next to her, shedding my jacket to try and avoid dripping it over my damp clothes. 

“Hey drowned rat, you’re late! You usually get here before me.” She shifted slightly to avoid any contact with the dripping rain, softened with an easy smile. I tried to return it, but it came out more as a grimace. I looked away. 

I zoned out most of the class. Rebbekah would occasionally glance over at me throughout her stories, giving me a look that I hadn’t seen since I first began to attend class with her. A sturdy look, eyes soft and flittering over me. Trying to avoid her prying eyes, I focused further on the lecturer. However her words just flowed directly through my head like water, impossible to grasp. 

“Are you okay?” I hadn’t realised that Rebbekah had been silent for the last however long. Her voice almost startled me. 

“Yeah. Yeah why?” 

“You’re quiet. Which, I mean you’re always quiet, but like you haven’t even been listening which- I don’t know, you just seem off.” I stared for a hollow moment at the crease between her eyebrows. Her eyes drilled into my head the longer the silence went on. 

“Just- Haven’t been sleeping well. The uh- the rats in my apartment again.”

“The exterminator didn’t work? I thought your landlord fixed that ages ago? You should really do something about that. It’ll only get worse.”

“I’ve been trying.” I thought about the bowls of cereal; about my fervent prayers. 

“You need to say something to your landlord. That place has been infested since you moved in which I think means he is not up to code or something-”

“It’s fine. He tried to get rid of them.” I had told him the last exterminator worked. I didn’t want him in my apartment. 

“Well can I at least come over and have a look for you? I got a friend’s brother who works in some sort of pest control so, I mean, he could come help maybe.” The thought of Rebbekah in my apartment, with the angels watching her, sent shivers across my arms. I breathed slowly through my teeth. 

“ No, no, I don’t want to bother him. It’s fine.” Rebbekah didn’t look convinced, her foot tapping agitated against her seat. 

“Marnie, you can’t live in a rat overrun apartment. You’re gonna get, like, a flesh eating disease or something.” She twisted her bracelet between her fingers over and over. “It would make me feel better if I could at least see how bad it’s gotten.” Her voice turned soft. It was the same tone she used when she first met me. That sickly sweet pitying tone that lit my insides in shame and rage. 

“I don’t need your help, Rebbekah. Just cause you couldn’t save Daniel doesn’t mean you can hover over me.” The air between us froze. The lecturers droning voice sat in the space like static. Rebbekah turned away for a moment, lips pursed firmly, eyes downcast, glassy. My insides turned to lead gravel and churned. I tried to say something, anything, to patch up the rift that I had just torn through us, but I just gaped softly in an attempt to form an apology. 

“I didn’t realise I was-” She paused, her lip wobbling as she searched for the word. “Overstepping. Sorry for worrying about you. No, wait.” She pressed her nails against her lips, mocking chewing them like a kicked habit. “That was mean. I know I've been a bit protective or whatever. I didn’t realise it was affecting you. I just worry, with you being alone, after your brother.” She continued to fake her nail biting as her eyes flicked between me and the lecturer. 

“No, I'm sorry. That was- You were trying to help. Sorry” Guilt burned through my blood, pooling in my chest. *How could I yell at her? She was trying to help. She’s my only friend. God, it really is in my nature.* “Do you want to come over this week? We could study or something.” Rebbekah held my eyes a little longer before glancing away again. 

“Okay. Thank you. That sounds nice; We haven’t hung out in a while.” Rebbekah spent the rest of the class uncharacteristically quiet as she soaked in the charged air. I spent the rest of it picturing Rebbekah as a dark spot on my living room carpet. 

As soon as I rushed through my door, I quickly began hopping about in a fruitless attempt to avoid dripping rain all over the floor. My shoes thudded against the wall by the door where I flung them. Stumbling through to the living room, I dropped to my knees next to the couch. 

“Forgive me. Please forgive me. I-” My mind was racing too fast for me to pull my thoughts into a sentence. “I didn’t mean to yell at her. She was- She was only trying to help.” My eyes darted around at the walls, listening for any creak or groan that might sound like forgiveness. “I didn’t mean to say that. I never mean it.” I don’t know if they could hear me as my voice grew quieter and quieter. “I don’t know why I think these things, or why I say them.” It came out as a whisper, barely audible even to myself. I stayed there. I listened for any noise in response. 

My knees began to ache from where I sat but I stayed. Kept my hands clasped in my lap and waited. And waited. And waited. But nothing happened. For the first time in a long time my apartment was silent and still. I stayed there, trembling arms clasped together, and knees throbbing against the bald carpet, and when the feeling of being watched never came, I stumbled up to my feet. 

Hesitantly I walked away. My stomach turned from the uncertainty. I walked past the kitchen and straight to bed. Curled up in my nest of tangled blankets, I continued to pray in my head. 

The silence lulled me through into sleep. 

Blinking through the haze of sleep, I was surprised to find my face pressed against rough carpet. An odd ache was present in my ankle. An ache, like a cold hand curled around it. My foot brushed up against a cool solid surface. In fact my whole body was chilled without my blankets. 

Being tugged across the floor was what shot me into consciousness. 

In an instant, I registered my hair dragging through the washing on my floor; The sensation of being held upside down, blood pooling towards my head. My drowsy body struggled to flail, arms moving thickly through the air. Whatever was dragging me had its hands curled around my entire leg, reaching up my back slowly, stroking and reaching for the rest of my body. I darted my eyes around the room, but I couldn’t see a thing in the darkness. My hands reached to pull off whatever was holding me. 

“Agh! Ah! Wha-” I was gasping, short, sharp sounds leaving me involuntarily as I struggled. Whatever it was, I couldn’t reach it. 

I was tugged harshly, pain beginning to radiate up my leg, and I was fully upside down. Scrabbling at the wall didn’t help. Whatever it was, it was strong. Quickly trying to escape I dropped my body, my back hitting the wall hard. By touch I scrambled to find anything. Brushing up against something solid, I grabbed it and flung it hard into the wall. My metal drink bottle thudded loudly. Whatever had my leg seemed to, in a humanlike moment, flinch. 

It released. It felt like hundreds of bugs skittering over my skin. My head hit the floor hard, my neck cricking badly as I crumpled into the carpet. I stumbled, my body fighting against me as I forced it up, and managed to slam on the lightswitch. 

Every corner and nook was like an eye watching me. I tried all I could to stare back at each one. All of them were empty. Locating where I had been dragged, found by the dent in my drywall, I tracked up to where I was going. The hole in my ceiling, from the leak last year. Where I always felt angels staring at me. My lip wobbled, poised between emotion, before stretching out into a toothy grin. Tears pooled in my eyes.. Dropping to my still aching knees I stared up at that little hole and cried like I had never cried before. I was going to Heaven. 

I woke up atop my duvet. My head pounded and my eyes ached, as if I had spent the night blackout drunk instead of sobbing on my bedroom floor. The apartment was dead silent. *They’re gone. I passed.* Giddy joy raced up through my chest, pulling at my cheeks and eyes. I almost felt like crying again. My duvet pooled around my hips as I pulled myself up to start this clean new day. 

The sun was streaming in through the curtains as I dressed, bravely donning a yellow crewneck that had sat for a long time in the back of my wardrobe. It felt good to walk through my apartment without hiding. I stepped out into the sunny lounge and for the first time since I left my childhood home, I felt hopeful. The dark spot was still there on my couch, but I decided to just pull down the blanket over it. *I’ll have to clean that at some point.* The bright day still continued to shine through the windows. I ended up moving to my couch to decide how to spend the day. Before I could think too much about it, my phone began to ring in my hand. 

“Hello?”

“Hey sweetie!” My mum’s cherry voice crackled through the phone, sounding almost distant, as if she was standing away from the receiver. 

“Hi, Mum. How are you?”

“Good good. Very busy as usual! How about you? Working hard?”

“Yeah, been studying a lot.” I lied. 

“You work so hard! Just like your brother. Be sure to take a break every now and then.”

“Don’t worry, I take care of myself.” With my free hand I picked at a loose thread in my jeans. 

“Oh, you have class today don’t you, so I better leave you then. Just give me a ring if you have time, okay? I like to know how you’re doing.” 

“Okay. I’ll talk to you soon. Love you.”

“Love you too. Bye now.”

My phone beeped as I hung up. I felt a little guilty lying to her about my classes, but I was determined to not let it ruin my day. Deciding then, I went to put on my coat and walk out in the sun. 

Stepping out, it felt warmer than it had in weeks. The sun kissed over the only bare skin on my face. Although despite its warmth I could still feel the chilled wind nip at my nose and ears. I picked the same path as last time, hoping to rewrite the memories of that desperate escape to the church. 

It was a beautiful day. Rays of light cast dappled shadows over the concrete and I now saw the autumn colours scattered through yards like a mosaic. Ever since last night it was like I had stepped into a new world. Like I had stepped into Heaven now that I knew I wasn’t damned. 

The church rose into view the same as it had days prior. There were still a few lone fogged up cars sitting in the carpark, and still skeletal trees stretched up around it. I stopped for a moment to just look, but this time, I walked on past. Instead I walked on to a local corner store. It was quiet, the only other customers I saw as I approached was a father shepherding his kids out with fistfuls of packaged candy. I scooted past the excited kids and into the store. 

Down the back of the store, I wandered to the fridges of chilled drinks, taking my time to browse the rows of colourful aluminium cans and plastic bottles. *I think I deserve a little something. After all that shit*. Eventually, I picked out a soda with cute packaging and slowly made my way to the counter, glancing through the rows of sweets along the way. After paying, I found a spot to sit on a metal ledge against the wall and took a moment to sip my drink in the sun. 

Eventually, I made my way back home. As I crossed onto my street, I checked my phone and found a text from Rebbekah. 

*May come over today to study. Be home. Also what snacks you want*

*1 hr ago*

*Oops.* My pace sped up as I went to meet Rebbekah. However, as my apartment came into view, I thankfully couldn’t see her car outside. I dug through my coat pockets for my house key as I juggled my bottle of soda and focused on not tripping. Pulling out my keys, standing on my front door step, I unlocked the door and went to step in but noticed something had stuck to my shoe. I looked down to scrape whatever it was off but it wasn’t on my shoe. It was on my doorstep. A large pool of something dark red and half dried. My stomach lurched and I nearly found myself throwing up on my shoes. *God please. Not again. I thought I was good.* My vision began to blur. Before I could pass out I flung open the door. 

Racing through the hall, leaving a grisly trail of sparse, disgusting spots, I grabbed the first thing I could find. I pulled the mink blanket from the couch, stumbled through the hall, and flung it over the pool. Dropping to my knees, I scrubbed at the mark. Most of it had already dried. My fingers cramped around it, gripping the fabric until my knuckles were white. I could feel the glassiness of my eyes, drying and tearing in the cold wind. The blood wasn’t coming off. 

At some point I could no longer feel my fingers, and my knees were beginning to regain feeling; a scraping, aching pain. I left the blanket on the doorstep covering the puddle. Closing the door felt like pulling shut a coffin. 

I locked down my house. If the angels wanted to deal with me then no one else needed to be involved anymore. My phone went into the bottom drawer of my dresser, underneath the folded shirts. I didn’t want to know if it was Rebbekah that had been on my doorstep. The curtains were drawn and would stay drawn for as long as this would take. After my doors were locked, I didn’t know what to do with myself. I sat alone on my couch, next to the remains of Brandon, with a half drunk bottle of soda on the coffee table. I waited. Waited for anything to happen. Maybe I should be scared at the prospect of going to Hell, but at the time I wasn’t. I didn’t feel much of anything. I just stared and stared at the bottle sitting on the table and waited. 

As I sat there in silence, eventually something moved. A little shadow in the corner of my eye. Looking up, it had already skittered away. I would have dismissed it had I not heard the scratching of something on the floor as it went. My hands began to gently tremble where I had them folded in my lap. Another one flittered through my vision deep in the dim light of the kitchen. It was too far and too quick to identify. The skin of my lip broke under my teeth. 

“It’s okay. You can take me now. I know what I did wrong.” My voice was cracking under the weight of the words. There was almost a relief in them though. 

The angels, as always, said nothing. Another one peeked from around the doorway to the hall for a moment. 

They made me wait. I stayed still, still as I could. I didn't move from where I was sat, and I waited. And waited. More and more they would flitter through my house; I could hear them scratching over the floors, but they never came near me. The light was beginning to dim through the curtains when I became restless. Every moment I waited, the guilt and fear built up in my chest. My lip was bloody and the holes in my jeans picked through. *Is this part of the punishment?* My body ached from how taught I held my muscles, and the anxiety that was trembling through me. 

I thought about my Mum. I wish I could have said goodbye. I wish I could be there to comfort her through the loss of her last living child. At the thought of her I could feel my eyes becoming wet, at the thought of her soft hands, her smile lines and crows feet, and her lively voice crackling through the phone. 

*I should have called her more*. 

An angel skittered through the kitchen door, stopping for a moment, almost long enough for me to look at it, but it fled again before I could clear the blur of tears. I rose from the couch,  knees cracking loudly in the silent house. 

“Why aren’t you taking me?” It came out hushed. I cleared my throat and rose my voice to be heard. “I admitted that I’m damned. The judgement is over, why aren’t you taking me to Hell?” Angel’s clattered around the house, now whispering amongst each other. I could hear fragments of what I had said repeated back. Mindlessly I moved towards the kitchen. The angels I could see scattered away as I approached.

“Do I need to confess? What do I need to do?” 

They whispered back; *What do- I need- What do-* The guilt and fear was churning in my chest, slowly turning on itself again and again. It hurt. The angels peeked around corners like they were listening.

“Please just tell me. You don’t need to punish anyone else, just me.” Again all I heard was hushed voices amongst the tapping of small feet and peeking heads. That feeling in my chest began to burn. It burned through my chest, into my arms and behind my eyes. 

“What do I do?!” I snapped. The angels skittered at the loud noise, shuffling back into their dark corners. 

“Just tell me what to do!” My chest ached. If they came back, I wouldn’t know; I could barely make out those judgmental figures through the blur of tears. The frustration began to burn hotter.

“Ple-e-ea-se!” I could barely draw a breath to form the words, blocked in my chest and throat. All they did was watch. They didn’t care. At this point, after those bloodstains, I didn’t either. The thought of the people who had been punished in my place stuck like a tack in my chest.

The bar stool had cracked through the drywall before I knew I picked it up. Splinters sprayed across the linoleum. My fingers ached as they clenched what was left. All eyes were on me. It clattered on the floor as I threw it down. I had definitely got their attention. The angels seemed to be peeking from behind every corner, doorway, and open cupboard. 

“It was my envy, right?! Because I hated Daniel?! I know, okay! I hate myself for it!” My face was wet and I could barely breathe between the guilt and rage clogged in my chest and the pathetic snuffling of my crying. “Please, I know, and you can punish me for it! I know I’m a bad person, I’ve known for a long time, but I’m confessing it! I confess that I was relieved when he died so I wouldn’t have to live in his shadow! I confess that I wished he would die for years! I confess that I hated him! It’s my fault! Let me be punished!” My throat felt shredded, as if the words themselves were tearing out of me as much as it felt like they were. 

The angels whispered endlessly. They made no move to drag me to Hell. They just watched and watched and watched as they judged my sins. I trembled under the hot anger flushing my face. I grabbed whatever was in reach and smashed it. Something shattered across the wall. 

“Do something!” My voice was raw. Everything felt raw. A university branded mug shattered into a burst of ceramic shards. There was no satisfaction in its destruction. Just a growing feeling of exposure. 

“Fucking university. I only went to make Mum proud since her pride and joy couldn’t achieve anything ever again.” The shards crackled under scurrying feet. “ I bet she wishes I died instead.” I said the words, but under the rage, I didn’t believe them. But my rage didn’t care. My other barstool was shoved to the floor where it lay pathetically. 

“Just punish me already!” Something inside me bubbled over and my hand buried itself inside my drywall, dark creatures scuttling out like insects. The pain radiated up my arm, jumping through me. Hissing, I pulled my fist away, blood and crumbling drywall dropping to the floor. The small cut on my knuckle was enough to shock me out of the haze I had been in, and in a moment all my anger melted back. As if I had just woken up, I was suddenly aware of the mess of shards and glass that littered the floor. My face was wet and my throat hurt. Throbbing pain shot through my hand. Looking back to the jagged hole in my kitchen wall, there were no insects pouring out as I had imagined. 

Though no one was there to see it, I felt ashamed of the state. 

I curled up, crouched over the mess, and I sobbed. It was like I was floating, every sin I had carried was pulled out of me, and I could feel the weightlessness of that burden. It was nice. But it was also like a part of me had left, and left behind a hole. But for now I just hoped maybe I had been relieved of my judgement. 

I cried hard into my hands. Everything I had been holding back for the past few days, my endless grief over Daniel, my guilt, all of it bubbled up in that moment, and I could not stop crying. It spilled out and out and out; over my face and spilling into my hands. I crouched there, sobbing so hard it began to echo throughout the house. 

From down the hall, I heard each of my own sobs, off-beat and hushed. My crying began to trickle into hitches of breath as I registered it wasn’t me I was hearing. They were in the hall. They were still here. I wasn’t even angry at this point, I just felt so tired. The glass crunched under my heels as I stood, impaling into my dirty sneakers I still hadn’t removed from my walk. The doorway to the living room felt impossible. Everything fell silent. There was a moment, where my breath was held and the air was as tense as I was; then a horrific reflection of my own face appeared from that doorway. 

I registered it was meant to be my face, but everything about it was wrong. Its eyes seemed to be melting from its head. The body jerked around the corner like an amateur’s marionette, struggling to move through its impossible proportions. Despite the sniffling half sobs coming from somewhere inside it, it conveyed no expression and its mouth stayed glued shut. I was frozen as I tried to register what this horrific doppelgänger was. Shambling across the glass, it didn’t even seem to register any sort of pain as it slowly moved closer and closer. 

Finally, my senses caught up to me. I scrambled backwards, skittering over glass until my back hit the edge of the counter. It continued to amble closer, seemingly knowing it would get to me in its own time. I was pinned in the kitchen. I had to move. As it’s gnarled hands reached out towards me I dropped to the floor, clambering across the ground and stumbling out to the lounge, nicks cutting into my hands and knees. Glancing back, it turned, slowly, its uneven eyes struggling to follow me as they rolled around in its head. Scrambling for anything, my head whipped around looking for something, some way to save myself. As soon as it left my sight, it pounced. 

My head cracked against the floor as we thudded into the carpet, rolling around and scrabbling against each other like animals. My nails caught and bent against the strange folds of the creature, where its soft peach rind skin had tried to form clothes. I struggled to shove it off, hands slick with sweat. It wasn’t coordinated, more slapping and wriggling as it struggled to puppet its body, but it was strong, and dense. Grunting, I managed to catch my hips enough to throw it off, and fumble back away from it on my hands until I hit the coffee table.

It seemed to fight against itself for a moment. Its limbs, appearing devoid of muscle, floundered under it as it attempted to push itself from the floor. Its useless eyes stared out at me from the warped version of my face, a blank unreadable expression and it’s empty maw of a mouth gaping open and closed. 

Everything in me was trembling. Sweat and tears dripped into my eyes. The doppelgänger limply rose, its neck twisted and its head drooping over its chest. 

*Huff huff.* It was mimicking my panicked breaths. 

“Do some- Do something.” My own voice, in a desperate rasp, choked out from it, muffled from within its body. I couldn’t help but sob in horror. I clawed at the floor as I crawled back towards the kitchen, out of the corner I had been backed into. It caught my ankle. Kicking and gasping, I fought against its bruising grip. It did not let go. It tugged at my leg, attempting to drag me to it, but unable to devise using it’s other hand. 

“An okay- an ok-y host. Host. Okay host.” It blabbered on and on. The grip on my ankle was so strong, it felt as if I could feel my bones creaking. The sobs from my chest were uncontrollable now. It was so strong. 

*I don’t even know what this is. I can’t do this. I can’t, I can’t, I don’t want to. God, please just let it stop.* It was hopeless. 

The creature yanked me back, clambering up my body on its unsteady limbs. I let go of the handfuls of carpet I had been gripping and clutched at my face, smearing tears across my cheeks and into my hair. A jolt of searing pain raced up my leg as small mouths dug into my flesh. Through the blur of tears I could see my own face buried into my leg with blood smeared across the many pairs of strange protruding mandibles, like bugs tearing into an overripe fruit. 

It was painful. The most pain I had ever felt. Now that it had got me, it reveled, tearing out bloody chunks of my leg muscle. I lay pinned, writhing and hiccuping beneath it, the same way I had when I broke my ankle falling from a tree when I was 12. More than anything, more than I wanted the pain to stop, I wished Daniel was there like he was when we were 12. As my vision spotted, I tried to picture him crouched next to me, hoarsely calling for mum and patting my muddy hair. I tried to feel his bony hand clutching my fingers through the overwhelming waves of pain. The tearing sound was drowning out his cries for help. 

Daniel had always been better than me. Where I had been spiteful in my envy, he had always cared for me. He hadn’t let go of my hand the whole way to the hospital. I may be an evil person, but Daniel never was. He would have told me to keep going. He wouldn’t have wanted me to give up and follow him. He would have forgiven me. 

I could almost feel his gentle fingers clutching my hand as I reached back, grasping with shaking hands the bowl of cereal that was still on the living room floor. It shattered as it collided with the creature’s head, splintering apart in my hand. 

It’s head seemed to dissolve, bug sized *things* skittering in all directions over my mangled leg. I used my numb arms to scramble back, smearing blood over the carpet, and tried to pull my leg from under it. Agonising pain shot through me like fire from a simple movement, but I kept trying, eventually pulling it free as I slid through the pools of blood. The thing was now half formed, struggling to keep whatever was making it up from skittering away as well. It was somehow more grotesque than when I had first seen it, now just a jaw sitting atop the neck, and its skin shifting and crawling. 

My back hit the wall, but I kept shuffling back, trying in vain to phase through and away from that creature, but all I could do was pull my legs in tight, having to manually pull what remained of the bloodied one towards me with my hands. The feeling of my own muscle flexing uselessly under my fingers still aches through my hands from time to time. 

Those bug-like things dispersed faster and faster, and what was once my doppelganger seemed to almost dissolve with it, jerking and twitching. Some of them skittered towards me, trying to get at my open wound, but as I yelped, they would run off; a lot less brave on their own. 

As my nightmare collapsed into nothing, along with it went my strength. My writhing shuffle slowed into shaking. Afraid to close my eyes, I continued to watch lifelessly as the last creatures skittered back away into the walls, and for a long time after I stayed there with my eyes open. After seeing something like that, after spending the last few weeks in a paranoid daze only to be proved right in a way, it’s hard to know what to do next. *Alright. Just break it down.* 

I don’t remember much of the after. Now that I’m back in that flat I can piece it together. I don’t remember it, but there's a blood trail from where I had huddled up against the wall all the way through to my dresser of my room. The bottom drawer is still open and my clothes are pulled out all over the floor. I must have called for help because I remember flashes of a hospital bed and a paramedic leaning down through the ghostly, bright lights asking my name. I know I didn’t tell them anything because Rebbekah told me she had to describe me to the nurses at reception. She had shown up to my flat to study, only to see the ambulance leaving and several cops milling around dumbfounded at my door. I still wonder who that stain was. Every night I apologise to them but I wish I had a name to pray for at least. 

Rebbekah dropped me off here today. I know she still desperately wants to know what happened that night, but I don’t know if I could explain it to anyone. I guess that’s why I’m writing this down. I just need it to be out there, but it must stay in this house. I just came to get my things. From here, I’m going back to my Mum for a bit. I don’t know from there, but at least I’ll drop by Daniel. Now though, I need to call my mum
