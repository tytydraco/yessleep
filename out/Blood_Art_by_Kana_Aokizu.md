Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the color… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.
