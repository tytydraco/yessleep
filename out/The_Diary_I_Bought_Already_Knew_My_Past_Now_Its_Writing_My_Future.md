I found the diary in a box at a yard sale.

The woman running the stall had a smile that looked stapled on, stiff at the edges, as if she hadn’t truly smiled in years. When I picked up the diary, she froze and stared at me. Then she whispered, almost breathless:

“Two dollars.”

It was worn, bound in leather, with a brass clasp that no longer locked. The pages smelled faintly of mold and smoke. And they weren’t empty. They were full.

The handwriting was messy but steady, all scratched out in black ink. At first, I flipped through it casually. But then my stomach tightened.

Because it wasn’t just anyone’s diary. It was mine.

It had EVERYTHING. My scraped knees as a kid. My weird crushes in grade school. The time I stole a dollar from my mother’s purse and stuffed it into my sock.  Every thought I had kept private, every shame I never told a soul, written down.

At first, I laughed nervously, convincing myself it had to be coincidence, some bizarre prank. But when I got home, something froze me to the core. The last page wasn’t about my past.

It was about now.

**August 28, 10:47 p.m.** \- He sits at the kitchen table, staring at these words, pretending he isn’t afraid. He swallows hard. Checks the front door, though he already locked it. Twice. He doesn’t know if he’ll hear the scratching in exactly three minutes.

The book slipped from my damp hands. I don’t know why I did it, curiosity, maybe, but I stayed there, watching the clock. Listening.

At exactly 10:50, I heard it. A slow, deliberate scrape at the front door. I didn’t sleep that night.

The next morning, I told myself I imagined it. But when I opened the diary again, my blood turned to ice.

**August 29, 8:02 a.m.** \- He tells himself it isn’t real. Tells himself he only imagined the sound. But if he listens carefully, he can still hear it, a faint scratching at the edge of his memory. He eats a piece of toast. He doesn’t notice the shadow in the hallway.

I snapped my head toward the hallway. Empty. But the feeling lingered, something had been there, watching me.

That night, I tried an experiment. I left the diary closed on my nightstand. When I woke up, it was open. A fresh entry filled the page. It described my dream. Word for word. The one where my dead father sat on the edge of my bed and whispered in a voice like broken glass: “You can’t shut it.”

\*\*\*

The entries didn’t stop.

They no longer waited for me to open the book. The diary wrote itself. Sometimes the ink was still wet when I touched it. And then… it went further.

Not just recording. Not just reflecting. Predicting.

**August 31, 6:44 p.m.** \- He thinks he’ll order takeout tonight. He won’t. Instead, he’ll cut his finger while chopping vegetables. The blood will drip into the sink in slow, deliberate beats, and he will stare at it for a very long time, hypnotized.

I laughed, grabbed a knife, and started slicing onions. Just to prove it wrong. The blade slipped. I watched a drop of blood swell at the tip of my finger—thick and red—before falling into the sink.

On September 1, I couldn’t take it anymore. I decided to burn the damned thing.

I carried it to the backyard, threw it into a metal trash can, and struck a match. But the second the flame touched the page, the words began to multiply. Ink bled across the paper like veins, racing faster and faster, filling line after line until the whole book trembled in my hands.

The fire went out. Cold. And there was a new entry.

**September 1, 9:03 p.m.** \- He tries to burn it. He can’t. It writes faster when he’s afraid. It feeds on him. He doesn’t understand he will never destroy it. The more he resists, the stronger it becomes.

I hurled it across the yard. It landed open on the grass, and the pages began to turn by themselves, as if invisible hands were rifling through them. The sound was like a hundred whispers all at once.

I ran inside and locked the door. I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this.

The diary doesn’t just predict anymore. It shows me things. Things that haven’t happened yet...but will.

Last night, it wrote:

**September 2, 12:14 a.m.** \- He won’t hear the window slide open. He won’t see the pale hand pulling back the curtain. He won’t know she’s already in the room until it’s too late.

I didn’t sleep. I sat in the corner of my room clutching a knife, staring at the window. Nothing happened.

But this morning, when I opened the diary again, the entry had changed.

**September 2, 7:40 a.m.** \- He sat in the corner all night with a knife. Thought it was enough. He didn’t notice the footprints in the carpet leading to his bed.

I looked. God help me, I looked. And they were there. Wet, pale footprints. Stopping inches from where I had been sitting. 

It’s writing now. Even as I hold it. The words are appearing while I write this to you. I can barely keep up. It’s describing me, writing, word for word, letter for letter as if it’s inside my head before my fingers even move.

I don’t know if posting this will help. Maybe if someone else reads it, it will break the cycle. Maybe then I’ll finally be free.

But the diary says otherwise.

It says:

**September 2, 9:58 p.m.** \- He thinks posting this will save him. He thinks someone out there will help. But all he’s done is spread it. Every person who reads his words has already opened their own diary. They just haven’t found it [yet.](https://www.reddit.com/u/salty_Astronaut77/s/H0bIOt4bRN)
