I’m a postgraduate student studying archaeology at a prestigious university in the UK (not going to disclose my identity or the name of my school, so don’t ask). Over a week ago, I was part of a group tasked with examining a dig site in Northern England: a low-lying forested area that used to be a village. Not much is visible now besides the faint indentations of old ditches and trenches, as well as the occasional outline of a stone foundation that had sunken into the earth. We weren’t expecting to find anything out of the ordinary — probably some broken tools or ceramic shards.

It was the second day of our expedition when one of my classmates found a spot of interest on top of a hill near the village. He uncovered bone and the section was quickly cordoned off. After hours of gently digging, we unearthed skeletal remains, approximately 70 centimetres deep, splayed out between dirt and roots in an unnatural, almost twisted way — likely indicative of a violent death. It was clearly not a proper burial; no coffin was present, much less a grave shroud. The remains were fairly well preserved, though, so our osteologist was able to form some estimates from eyeballing the bones: they belonged to a male, likely middle-aged, and showed multiple signs of blunt force trauma on the skull, ribs, pelvis, and spine (presumably the cause of death).

Discovering human remains is always a big deal, but what was even more compelling was what we found after that: a small, stainless steel lockbox, lying a couple meters away from the skeleton. Obviously this raised a few eyebrows. Despite being dented and corroded, this thing looked far more modern than the rest of the artefacts found in the area, which tended to be Anglo-Saxon in origin.

As the sun waned, we photographed the box in situ before packaging it and labelling it. For now, there was nothing we could do about the body besides make a couple calls to notify our archaeology department and the local authorities, as was routine. In the morning, we would begin bagging and moving the bones. As for the lockbox, we were able to bring it back to our lodgings, which also served as a makeshift lab. My professor seemed visibly anxious; he quickly x-rayed the artefact and then cracked it open (it was a rather simple lock and key mechanism). Usually we would wait for more ideal lab conditions before opening anything, but everyone here was far too curious to adhere to strict standards.

Inside the lockbox we found a series of notes: five sheets of paper stacked neatly on top of each other. The paper looked quite modern; nowhere close to being medieval. So we began to think maybe the bones weren’t as old as we initially thought… None of it made sense. The notes were mainly handwritten (in modern English no less), aside from the header: thick black type reading **“North American Temporal Law Committee.”**

At that point we had no choice but to sit down and read the documents page by page; me, my professor, and six other postgrads. It started off exciting, like we were uncovering a mystery, but soon the atmosphere became more dour. The contents of these documents were rather upsetting to a few of us. One girl excused herself and apparently drove home all alone (more than 300 kilometres). By the time we finished reading, my professor had gotten blind drunk and began accusing one of us of playing a prank. It seemed like he was more terrified than angry. He practically screamed at us for hours, before passing out on the couch.

No one wanted to go back to the dig site the next morning, and we all caught separate rides back home. That night, as I was riding the train, I got an email confirming the age of the remains. We’d submitted a collagen sample the day before for rapid testing, and the analysis showed that the bones were ancient — at least 900 years old. That message has since disappeared from my inbox.

When I arrived back at the university, I began writing up my report of the trip, only to find that our department had no record of the lockbox and the grave: meaning that nobody had entered that information into the system yet. Or… it had been erased. Naturally, I tried to dig deeper, only to get hopelessly waylaid by bureaucracy. The faculty I questioned said they had no idea what I was talking about; they all recommended I talk to someone else — someone “higher up.” At the very most, I was sometimes told to leave my phone number so they could get back to me later (of course, they never did).

The next day, I received an email from my professor, notifying us that student write-ups of the trip would no longer need to be submitted. That trip was supposed to be our final assessment of the year, and just like that it had been completely abandoned.

I wanted to speak with the other postgrads from that trip, but I was only able to get in touch with one of them. We met briefly in a courtyard between classes. He told me that the whole thing had been proven to be a hoax, and that’s why the artefact and bones had been confiscated. It was difficult to take his words at face value; it barely sounded like he believed himself. I tried to ask my professor about all of this, but he hasn’t been in his office for days, nor will he respond to any of my phone calls or emails.

I didn’t feel comfortable in my uni room. I could hear every footstep in the hall; I jumped every time I saw someone walking on the sidewalk outside the window. I only stayed there for a couple hours before ditching the residence halls altogether. I took my laptop and a travel bag, got on a train, and rode until midnight. I hope I’m just being paranoid, but I’ve had this eerie feeling the past few days, like I’m being watched or followed. My hands start sweating every time a stranger walks behind me for more than a block.

I’ve been on my own for the past three nights. For the moment, I’m at a cheap hotel with my laptop and some corner shop food. As I type, I keep glancing out the window, again and again. A big white SUV has been parked down there for hours now; I swear I’ve seen it before, probably back on campus. Maybe I’m crazy.

At the digsite, I was able to make one copy of the documents while my professor was passed out on the couch… I’m going to transcribe the writing and insert it below. I want other people to see what I’ve seen, and posting it online is the quickest and most anonymous way I can think to do so. Maybe someone else can make sense of it.

**North American Temporal Law Committee**

**Field Operations Report**  
**Category:** Class B temporal disturbance  
**Operator ID:** SMDT-B-083 (Tremel, K. T.)

**Home Date:** 20-12-2237 CE  
**Travel Date:** 17-10-1123 CE  
**Location:** 54.3099, -0.8482

**17 October:**

* Operator Tremel (SMDT-B-083) was deployed to the earliest day in which the anomaly had been observed.
* Anomaly discovered to be the unauthorized temporal displacement of a small, seemingly damaged radioactive isotope source, likely used in medical or industrial capacity before being appropriated.
* Offenders are suspected to be terrorist-affiliated; while in the process of creating a radiological dispersal device, a leak likely forced them to dispose of the evidence.
* At this point, the source cannot be observed at close range. It was deposited at the edge of a small, isolated farming village in England; approximately 50 kilometers north of York.
* Population of area inhabitants is estimated to be between 60 and 70 persons.
* As expected with XLB machine use, digital technology failed to materialize upon transportation. Operator manifest includes analog/mechanical tech (all accounted for), including: pen and paper, magnetic compass, mounted field scope, engineering and medical tools, shelf-stable rations (good for 30 days), lantern (with 3 liters of oil), hazmat suit, and single occupant tent.
* Upon arrival, a secure observation post was established on a grassy slope, 100 meters upwind of the settlement. Position is close enough to be within visual range, but removed enough to ensure safety and non-interference, as per NATLC protocol. Communication rendered impractical anyway, as the subjects speak an archaic language.

**19 October:**

* For the last two days, villagers (subjects) have shown curiosity toward the (heavily damaged and partially disassembled) device. As expected, they lack understanding of its hazardous nature: continuously prodding at it and conducting what appear to be crude experiments.
* Tools, such as sickles and knives, have been used to further dismantle the device.

**20 October:**

* Many subjects have begun retrieving scraps from the device’s casing and even harvesting radioactive powder directly from the core; going so far as to apply it to the body, burn it, and consume it.
* Subjects appear fascinated by the powder’s photoluminescence and showcase it openly. Most village inhabitants have come into close contact, likely believing the radioisotope source to be supernatural or valuable.
* Some households have begun mixing small amounts of powder into their wine or stew; possibly as a special ingredient or health supplement.
* Isolated cases of severe nausea and vomiting observed with field scope (herbal remedies have been distributed in reaction). Instances of uncoordinated muscle movement also observed.

**22 October:**

* Behavior of the subjects has shifted drastically. Some have begun exhibiting religious fervor in the form of processions and communal rituals, which often involve the nuclear device and/or radioactive materials.
* Physical symptoms of Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) have become more common: including swelling/reddening of the skin, blisters, ulcers, etc.
* Death toll of three (2 men, 1 woman). All three bodies were transported on carts and buried in separate graves on the perimeter of the settlement.

**23 October:**

* Massive hair loss observed among subjects; tangled clumps lie in the dirt and blow in the wind. Many subjects’ fingernails have either turned black or fallen off completely.
* Some have attempted to leave the village, but were prevented from doing so by authority figures (religious leaders, Elders possibly).
* Despite adverse effects, reverence of the radioisotope source largely continues (in some regards resembling cultlike behavior).
* Makeshift shrines have been assembled using scraps and pieces of the nuclear device. At nighttime, the soft glow of radioactive materials is faintly visible from the outpost.

**24 October:**

* Death toll has risen quickly. Mass graves have begun to be used for burials. Subjects appear confused by the events, some beginning to panic.
* Bodies weakening: weight loss, malformation, bruising. Radiation burn marks and swelling observed on hands. Village barber has conducted crude amputation procedures on the fingers and limbs of several subjects.
* Foul odors carried on the wind (decomposition, human waste).

**25 October:**

* Expiration of subjects has continued at a rapid rate. Psychological and physical deterioration clearly evident. Cognitive impairment has been observed in the form of confusion and delirium. Subjects struggle to remember familiar routines (such as farming, housework, preparing food) and exhibit severe disorientation. Many walk in circles or stand aimlessly, mumbling. Seizures are common.
* Subjects are assumed to be experiencing internal hemorrhaging (blood expelled from the gums, nose, and in rare cases, the ears).
* Subjects have been compulsively scratching at radiation burns, resulting in further injury. Seemingly an attempt to 'cleanse' themselves of unseen contamination.
* Sounds observed: chanting, praying, crying, coughing, intermittent groans and screams.

**26 October:**

* Severe confusion and derangement observed. This behavior is collectively suggestive of “radiopsychosis,” i.e. somatopsychic illness caused by ARS. 
* Subjects are experiencing what seem to be hallucinations or delusions, likely caused by radiotoxic encephalopathy. They react to non-existent stimuli and behave in paranoid ways. Instances of aggression; subjects are easily provoked and quick to violence.
* No corpses have been buried since 25 October. Eight bodies (dead or possibly comatose) line the pathways of the village, fallen in the mud and left unattended. 
* Wolves and foxes have begun appearing on the village perimeter, looking to feed; subjects dispelled them with torches.
* Death toll estimate: 18-24.
* Village barber has begun dissecting expired bodies to observe their internal condition. Rudimentary surgeries performed on living subjects (bloodletting, trepanation) have resulted in infection and death.

**27 October:**

* Some subjects show signs of gross religious passion and possible scapegoating: resulting in public displays of lynching, burning at the stake. Subjects are paranoid; likely believe curses or divine retribution have befallen them. Some engage in fervent prayer or veneration of relics. Self-flagellation observed.
* Documented: one male subject repeatedly banging their head against a tree.
* Physical state of subjects: loss of teeth, bloody vomit, severe radiation burns, localized necrosis; large sections of the skin are red, blistered, and peeling away, revealing underlying tissue. 
* Many subjects are too weak to move or even stand; others display intense restlessness and agitation. Those who are still mobile have become bold, roaming outside the village. On two occasions they have come alarmingly close to the observation post. It is possible that they have noticed a foreign presence, though unlikely. 

**28 October:**

* With the use of a hazmat suit, Operator ventured down to the village at night and covertly intercepted two cadavers that had fallen close to the forest. Autopsies were conducted in a makeshift tent, 50 meters north of the observation post.
* Cadaver 1: male, approximately 35. Missing three fingers; swelling in the upper body; hair loss; skin loss; substantial kidney and lung damage; internal bleeding. Cause of death determined to be respiratory complications.
* Cadaver 2: female, approximately 60. Hair loss; blotchy, blistering skin; internal bleeding (eyes, limbs, digestive tract). Cause of death determined to be septicemia.
* Most subjects in the village have likely been exposed to 5-10 sieverts of ionizing radiation (varying per person).

**29 October:**

* Although direct examination of the nuclear artifact was rendered unfeasible, debris was identified as mid-23rd-century technology (aligning with the suspected timeline of origin).
* Scorch marks on the debris indicate that the temporal displacement was facilitated by a TRS-05 machine, produced and obtained illegally.
* Documented: male subject engages in acts of cannibalism when he thinks nobody is looking.
* Death toll: 35-40. Wolves, foxes, and crows have been able to enter the village more often, feeding on corpses and incapacitated persons when possible. 

**30 October:**

* Day 14: study of the disturbance is close to its conclusion. Final recommendation is that the village be sterilized.
* In other words: in order to ensure timeline stability: contain radiation exposure and then cleanse the area afterward.
* Calculations estimate that the village will experience a complete demographic expiration in 7-10 days (21-24 days after initial exposure).
* Home Date return scheduled to occur within 5-6 days. XLB machine currently being prepped for departure.

**31 October:**

* Mentally deranged subjects located operations outpost at 0300 hours, proceeded to set fires and smash equipment with axes and other tools. XLB machine was partially damaged. Operator managed to flee the situation and remain undetected.
* XLB machine requires maintenance in order to function properly. Initial examination indicates that this is potentially feasible, but very difficult due to lack of energy sources and advanced tools (as well as the presence of increasingly dangerous and unstable subjects).
* Home Date return may need to be delayed. Field operations outpost will be relocated further out while still maintaining visuals on the village.
* At this point, radioactive isotope source has been completely taken apart with pieces distributed across the village area. 
* Multiple structures have been burnt (partially or completely); some fires seem unintentional, but many subjects show signs of ceremonial pyromania (motivations unknown).
* Weak subjects have been taken to the church building (overcrowded, dirty).
* Area silent, birds no longer chirping. Village pigs have escaped pens and begun feeding on remains (starving and likely irradiated); village dogs have also resorted to this behavior (necrotic skin, patchy fur, very aggressive).

**1 November:**

* New operations outpost — improvised but concealed.
* Maintenance efforts to the XLB machine are unsuccessful so far. During the previous day’s attack, engineering tools suffered damages, increasing the difficulty of potential repairs.
* Containment shell — cracked, exposing inner mechanics (problematic but fixable).
* Spatiotemporal chamber — core is balanced and secure.
* FT-calibration interface — index error, slight echo/bleed.
* Anchor node — indicating drift (only 99.93% stable).
* Casimir drive — overextending field; dangerously close to collapse if left untreated (urgent).
* Manifest of remaining supplies: pen and paper, compass, field scope (damaged but usable), engineering and medical tools (heavily damaged), shelf-stable rations (good for 8-10 more days), lantern (approximately 0.8 liters of oil remaining).
* Hazmat suit and tent are burnt and unusable. Operations (and rest) will have to be conducted in the open. Lantern use will be heavily limited to counter risk of further detection.
* Expiration of the village population continues at the expected rate. Death toll: 45-50.

**2 November:**

* Supply situation: critical.
* XLB machine condition: nonfunctional.
* Operator contingency plans are being reviewed.
* Aggressive subjects — fewer numbers, still active.
* Church interior — pile of bodies.
* Dead — more than 55 counted.

**3 November:**

* Further maintenance ineffectual. Operator safety crucial (defense contingency plan engaged).
* Storm approaching. Notes will be secured in lockbox.
