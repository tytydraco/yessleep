When I was a kid I remember watching this video with my cousin Michael on Saturday November 5th 2016. The following nights I was terrified of a lockdown occurring at my school. 3 days later the election was held. The day was November 8th 2016 on a Tuesday. It was around 2:15 to 2:30 when we were dismissed from class. I was scheduled to meet with a friend after school. I was extremely excited and I was walking out of the hallway of the "Mountain View elementary school." The speakers ringed to life as I heard the announcements say that the school is going on lockdown. 

Kids start worrying and running around and before I know it my teacher Mrs. Ramirez starts yelling at all of us to get into her class now. I ran into that classroom having just learned about the concept of lockdowns from this video right here 3 days before it happened. We stayed cooped up in that classroom for the next 4-5 hours. All of us pressed up against a wall. Somewhere in the middle after tears from numerous kids had been flowing including myself I managed to calm down. The intercom went off once more revealing that one kid had not been accounted for in a classroom. This kid was my little brother. I immediately started fucking losing it while I sat there not knowing what the fuck was going on outside. Knowing that my brother had been locked out of a class and had no way of getting back to one. Not too much happened on my end of the story though. Ever since the incident I've done more and more research. 

My mom has only vaguely mentioned it to avoid scaring me but this is her story: She was home alone waiting. At some point she found that there was commotion on the street. There was a man. A man with a gun. He was standing in our driveway. Up against one of our cars. My mother called the police as she proceeded to hide in the closet. She called and the police had gotten multiple calls from other people. 

The actual story goes like this: A man named Carlos Mendez got angry. His wife and kids left him on the Monday right before the incident occurred because they were "scared of him." He got hopped up on cocaine. He was ex-military and before going on a rampage of shooting he wore a black military uniform and then got hopped up on cocaine. He was a gun fanatic and so he brought out a rifle, a pistol, and a knife before going out into the public. This man lived across from my street. He started walking up and down the street first shooting a 59 year old woman in a van which crashed and then proceeded to shoot a 67 year old woman walking down the street. The area where we live is directly adjacent to a park known as memorial park which has a rec center in which dozens of people were voting. They all had to be placed on lockdown in the rec center. 

This man then proceeded to shoot at a 77 year old man and neighbor of mine named Francis William Verney who died in the ambulance on the way to get help. There were records of one of the women who was shot continuing to run and banging on door after door for help. The two women were helicopter lifted to a nearby trauma center. Both survived initially. The 67 year old Elida Dominguez died from complications of the gunshot based on my assumption to the head later in 2018. Police surrounded the man and shot him to death. Tear gas was used. I will always remember getting out of my classroom and immediately hearing the roars of the helicopters above.

 The sky dark but just these loud thundering moving lights floating in the sky shining these giant lights down on the grass field. My fellow classmates all walked out with me down the hallways. Dozens of swat members and cops had completely flooded the school. We walked past lines of officers with huge guns as the lights from the helicopters continued to shine. We walked out to which point I found my father. My brother was completely fine. We got into my fathers car and tried to drive to our house but it was blocked off for the night. We all went to target. My father bought me a pack of Pok√©mon cards which was a rare occurrence. We then drove over to Fullerton where we stayed with my grandparents for the night. All I wanted to do was go to sleep as the rest of my family watched the election. I drove back home the next morning. 

We never talked about it again. Once I got home I knew there was going to be no mention of it. A couple years of my brain being so scared of shooters being around every corner stuck with me. Everything worked out for me and my family but the feeling I get when I walk down my street knowing that something like that happened. Knowing a shooter was up against my car in my driveway is such an unreal feeling. This shooting became slightly famous as Donald Trump who ended up winning the election came to the small town of Azusa and awarded medals of honor to the many brave police officers who managed to stop the man who started this whole thing. There were 4 more lockdowns at my school but nothing ever felt worse than that initial lockdown. The lockdown in which I told myself would never happen. The one that happened 3 days after I watched this video
