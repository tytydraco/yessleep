 My name is Dr. Sandra Stewart, an aerospace engineer with a career at NASA that spans decades. I've played a key role in some of the most critical discoveries in space exploration. As a veteran with high-ranking credentials, I've been involved in more missions than I can count, but nothing compares to what I'm about to reveal. Now that I've retired, I believe it’s finally safe to share this story.

In 2010, Dr. Michael DeVanta and I were selected for a top-secret, government-funded mission to the moon. The mission was launched after one of NASA’s satellites detected strange sound waves originating from the dark side of the moon. What we encountered there was beyond anything we could have imagined.

The journey itself was one of the most harrowing experiences of my life. The stress was nearly unbearable, with every possible disaster scenario running through my mind—the pod could explode, we could run out of fuel, or worse. But Michael, who had helped design the very pod we were in, always reassured me. He was confident that everything would be fine. In fact, he jokingly promised that if we did blow up, I could hold him responsible in the afterlife.

But the real terror began when we landed on the moon. Being alone with just one other person on what felt like an entirely different planet was unnerving, to say the least. As we stepped onto the surface, Michael took the lead, guiding us toward the coordinates Houston had provided. When we finally arrived, what we found was nothing but a vast, empty field with nothing but the barren, gray landscape stretching endlessly before us. The Earth hung low in the sky, a distant, fragile-looking orb. My heart pounded in my chest, echoing in my helmet as we approached the coordinates. 

"Are you sure this is the right place?" I asked, my voice trembling slightly despite my best efforts to remain calm.

Michael double-checked the readings on his device and nodded. "This is it. The signals came from here."

We stood there for a few moments, listening to the eerie silence that filled the void. The stillness was unsettling, and the idea that something on the dark side of the moon had been broadcasting sound waves was more than enough to set my nerves on edge.

"Let's set up the equipment," Michael suggested, breaking the silence. 

We worked in tandem, setting up various sensors and devices to try to detect any anomalies. As we completed the setup, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, though logic told me that was impossible. The moon was supposed to be a dead, lifeless rock. 

Hours passed, and still, there was nothing. No sound, no movement, nothing but the dull hum of our equipment and our own breathing. Just as I was beginning to think we’d come all this way for nothing, one of the monitors beeped.

"Did you hear that?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Michael leaned in closer to the monitor. "I did. It's faint, but it’s there."

We both listened intently as the signal repeated itself, a rhythmic series of sounds that didn’t match anything we were familiar with. It was unlike anything we’d ever encountered, a pattern that was almost… deliberate.

"Could it be interference?" I suggested, trying to rationalize the inexplicable.

Michael shook his head. "No, this is something else."

As we listened, the sounds grew louder, more distinct, and I realized with a shiver that they almost resembled a language—though not one that any human had ever spoken.

"We need to report this," I said, reaching for the communication device.

But as I did, the ground beneath us trembled. It was subtle at first, just a slight vibration, but then it grew stronger, more violent, until the entire lunar surface seemed to be shaking. I lost my balance and fell to the ground, my helmet hitting the dust-covered surface with a thud.

"Michael!" I called out, panic rising in my chest. 

He was already on his feet, pulling me up with one hand while the other clutched his scanner.
We started running back toward the pod, but the ground continued to shake, and it was as if the moon itself was coming to life beneath us. Suddenly, a ravine opened up ahead, cutting off our path.

Michael skidded to a stop, looking around desperately for another way out. As the shaking intensified, I saw something emerge from the fissure—a dark, shadowy figure that seemed to be made of the very darkness of the moon itself. It rose up, towering over us, its form shifting and flickering as if it couldn’t fully solidify in the harsh lunar environment.

"What the hell is that?" I breathed, frozen in place by the sheer terror of the sight.

Michael didn’t answer. He just grabbed my arm and yanked me in the opposite direction, away from the pod and away from the thing that had just crawled out of the moon. We ran blindly across the surface, the tremors making it difficult to keep our footing.

Finally, the shaking stopped as suddenly as it had begun. We collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath, and when I looked back, the ravine had closed up, and the figure was gone.

"What… just happened?" I asked, still trying to process what we had seen.

"I don’t know," Michael replied, his voice shaken. "But we need to get out of here. Now."

We hurried back to the pod, our minds racing with questions and fears. Whatever we had just encountered, it was clear that the dark side of the moon held secrets that no one on Earth could have ever imagined. As we lifted off and began our journey home, I couldn’t help but wonder if we had just stumbled upon something that was never meant to be found.

And now, after all these years, I’m left with the haunting realization that some mysteries are better left undiscovered.
