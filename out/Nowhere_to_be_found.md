**To: Whoever’s looking for her now,**

You should stop. You won’t find her.

You’re probably wondering how it came to this, how someone like Emma could just *vanish* without a trace. You think she was taken, don’t you? Some masked figure, some unknown attacker breaking into her apartment in the middle of the night? You’d like to think that, wouldn’t you? Something that fits your understanding of the world.

You’ll never understand this. You’ll never find me.

Emma didn’t disappear like you think. I didn’t need to force my way into her life. She invited me in, without even knowing it. She was so *alone*—so tired, every single day. I was already part of her world before you even started worrying. I was with her before anyone thought to check in. The loneliness? That was my introduction. The growing sense of dread she felt in those final days? That was me.

She didn’t see me at first. None of them do. It started like it always does: a feeling, something in the air. You know what I’m talking about, don’t you? The kind of feeling where the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, and you’re not sure why. Emma was sensitive to it. She would pause sometimes, mid-sentence, and glance around, trying to figure out why she felt watched. 

She *was* being watched. 

By me.

You probably found the little things first—the notes she left herself, reminders scribbled in her handwriting on scraps of paper. “Lock the door.” “Check the windows.” She thought it was her mind playing tricks on her, but I was already there, in her apartment, before she even realized it.

Do you want to know what she was thinking the first time she *really* felt me? It was late. She was alone in that cold apartment, sitting in her living room with the TV on for company, the light flickering against the walls. She thought she saw something move out of the corner of her eye. A shadow. But it wasn’t. It was me, stepping closer.

She froze, staring at the empty space across the room, her heart pounding. I could feel it from where I stood, watching her in that moment of realization. She didn’t scream. She didn’t even move. She just *sat there,* Emma’s wide eyes fixed on the space where I had been. I liked that about her—the way she didn’t fight it, not at first. That’s when I knew I’d chosen well.

You won’t find her body. I didn’t take her in the way you’d think. No, Emma belonged to me long before the end came. I was in every breath she took, every beat of her heart. I was there in the moments she stood at her window, staring out into the night, wondering why she felt like she was being watched. You won’t understand that, will you? You’ll look at the facts and the evidence, and you’ll try to piece it together. But you can’t.

Emma was mine from the start.

I made myself at home in her apartment—your team probably found the signs. The dishes she didn’t remember leaving out, the lights turned on in rooms she hadn’t entered. You think she was losing her mind, don’t you? The woman was just “confused,” right? But no, she was never crazy. She was just beginning to *see* me.

It wasn’t long before she realized she couldn’t escape me. She tried to leave once. I watched her as she packed a bag, her hands shaking. She thought she could outrun me, thought she could move out of that apartment and be safe. She couldn’t. I followed her everywhere. I’m in the air she breathes, in the dark corners of every room, in every reflection she tries to ignore.

She couldn’t run, and she couldn’t hide.

The night she finally gave in, she was standing in her bedroom. She thought she was alone. She thought she’d locked the door, closed the window. But I was already inside, watching. I always preferred that moment—the one where they realize it’s over, that no amount of running or hiding would save them. Emma stood there for the longest time, just staring at the bed, as if maybe I’d disappear if she didn’t look at me.

I didn’t disappear. I stepped closer. 

And then she saw me, truly saw me for the first time. The fear in her eyes, that final understanding—it was beautiful. She knew I’d won. She knew she was mine, and in that moment, she didn’t fight. There’s something satisfying about watching them stop fighting. You won’t find a struggle, not here. You won’t find signs of forced entry or evidence of violence.

Emma accepted what she had always known deep down: she wasn’t meant to live without me.

You won’t understand any of this. You’ll comb through her phone records, dig through her emails, her texts, looking for some explanation. You’ll search through her belongings, trying to find some logical reason for why she vanished. But you’ll find nothing. 

Because she didn’t leave anything behind.

She’s with me now. And she’ll always be with me.

Stop looking for her.

She doesn’t belong to you anymore.
