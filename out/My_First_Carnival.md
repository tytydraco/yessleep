After my 8th birthday I began to see flyers pop up in all different areas. The mall, my school, the grocery store my mom took me to after school every other Friday to get groceries. Just the same flyer reading “come on down” in big letters. I never really cared to pay much attention to it. I was too focused on looking for a toy or a candy that I would beg my mom to buy for me, but one day I got bored in class and asked to use the bathroom. I walked down the hallway I’ve walked 100 times before, but instead of heading into the bathroom I stopped right outside letting my eyes wonder to the dull maroon and yellow sign hanging on the wall just outside the bathroom to the left. 

It was covering multiple of old flyers for book fairs or companions for various things. I had never paid attention to any other of these posters. I’ve used this bathroom countless times, but it felt like I was drawn to this poster. I got closer studying the page. “COME ON DOWN!” I read the big letters like I had before. It felt like it was screaming at you. My eyes wondered bellow the big letters. Much smaller letters read the following “Pentsville Carnival”. We had never had anything like this before, or not that Ive know of.  October 10th was marked not to far under the text. I felt a surge of excitement rush over me. I’ve never been to a carnival. I’ve always wanted to go to one, was it like what I’ve seen in the tv? The curiosity was killing me. I quickly ripped the poster from the wall tearing a bit of the other posters too, and stuffed it in my back pocket. 


After the bell had rung I rushed down the hall excited to tell my mom about the carnival. I headed outside to see my mom chatting with another parent. “Mom!” I yelled from the front of my school. I ran to our car as fast as I could, my new shoes helped of course. “Hey sweetie” my mom greeted me the way she always had. I didn’t respond there was only one thing on my mind. I quickly reached in my back pocket pulling out the crumpled paper. “Can we go” I nearly shouted. She looked at the paper carefully reading over every letter like she was looking for an error. “I don’t know Scott….its on a week day”. “please please please” I begged. She looked at me with those eyes she would give me at the grocery store when she finally caved into letting me have a piece of candy. “Well alright”. I jumped in excitement smiling from ear to ear. “Listen” she crouched down to my level “best behavior, you understand”. She was serious and I knew she was serious. I just nodded in agreement still grinning. 


The date of the carnival rolled around. I couldn’t sit still all day. The excitement was taking over my body like an itch but a good itch. I watched as the clock struck 3 o’clock. I quickly packed my backpack after hearing the bell. I piled at the door with the rest of my classmates. My teacher had yelled something at us but my mind was too crowded to hear what she had said. I booked it to my mom’s car. She wasn’t talking to the other parents like she had done in the past. I guess she was excited too. I threw open the rear door before tossing myself inside the small car. “You ready?” She leaned back at me. “Yes!” I shouted. “Let’s get going” a Beatles song filled the car. 

We pulled up to the grass parking lot . There was more people than I was expecting. I even saw some kids from school. We stopped at the ticket both my mom handed the young gentleman some money. My mom escorted my into the carnival. I was expecting lights to be everywhere and lots of color, but I was a bit disappointed. It was all kind of dull? I chalked it up to be because it was still light out. “We should see this!” My mom leaned down showing me a small flyer for one of the shows they were having. “Yeah!” I still had some hope and wonder. 

We headed to the small tent next to the gross smelling food. My mom pulled her head up as if she was smelling the best smell in the world. I didn’t think much of it. My mom tugged on my hand pulling me to the small bench seat close the front beside some other family. The lights cut off not to long after we sat down. A big light filled the stage. 

Something came out from behind the curtain that what I can only describe as a rabid dog creature. It had a distinctive limp that mad my hair stand up. Its drool soaked the floor as it growled almost as if I were the one it was targeting. I was so confused this was nothing like I saw on the tv. Follow the dog a tall figure reaching almost 10 feet tall approached. It had no features, no clothes. Just darkness. It had one key element about it that I can remember. The glowing red eyes, eyes that would follow you, eyes that were hypnotizing. 

I turned to look up at my mother. She was crying, but it wasn’t happy, I’m not even sure if it was sad. She just stared forward letting her eyes get puffy and her face get drenched. I shook her a little but it was no use. I started to feel alone. I pulled my knees to my chest. A loud song started playing, it sounded like those horses you would ride at the mall but it was all distorted it got louder and louder. I covered my ears trying to block out the noise, but as soon as it started it had stopped. I looked back to my mom her ears had blood dripping from them. I had never been so worried in my life. I shook her hard, but my attention was quickly pulled back to the stage. 

The shadowy man had a flaming ring that he held out about 7 feet from the ground. The fire was touching his hand but he didn’t mind. I watched as the rabid dog sprinted towards the ring running through it. I almost enjoyed that part. It was impressive I couldn’t deny, but my enjoyment slipped away as the dog was engulfed in flames. I watched as the skin started to seep off the dog like ice cream off an ice cream cone. The dog howled in agony. I could soon see all the muscles and tendons of the dog boil under the heat. I felt tears stream down my face. I wanted to scream I wanted to help but I couldn’t. I. Was. Planted. 


The tall man stared at me I could feel the joy in those soulless eyes I could tell he enjoyed it. My stomach turned I thought I was going to be sick, but nothing came up. The dog dragged himself behind the curtain along with the shadow.

I was confused and stunned that the dog was still alive, but that question disappeared fast after a woman strolled out from behind the curtain. She was normal. Finally something normal. 

A bed of nails slowly started to rise out from the floor of the stage. I’ve seen this act be done before on movies. I still don’t know how they do it, or if it’s even possible in real life. She walked up to the rows of nails. I was more nervous than ever. my stomach tightened painfully. 

I went to check if my mom was still there, even though she wasn’t responding or moving. I needed to know that I wasn’t alone. I look over to an empty seat. A once packed tent had now been cleared out. I WAS alone. The lady on stage placed her foot above the bed before making a full step. The nails tore through her foot immediately. Blood poured out. She snapped her head at me smiling. Her eyes looked like they could come out of socket at anytime. She took another step. Once again the nails tour through tissue, muscle, bone, and everything else in a foot. There was chunks of flesh clinging to the nails, blood was drenching the stage. I wanted to look away. I wanted it to be over, but it was as if someone had peeled my eyes opened and held my head in place. I squeezed my legs. Tears rolled down my cheeks. The lady continued to walk. Every new step she rotated her foot to puncture a new place. By the time she had made it to the end of the bed her feet were unrecognizable, if you could even still call them feet. 

My heart was pounding out of my chest I was having a hard time breathing. I clenched my shirt. There was silence for a while. I hoped that had been it. I’ve seen enough. 

A horn sound came from the right of me. I didn’t wanna look, but what choice did I have. I slowly turned my head. Nothing. I sighed in relief. the relief passed as I heard the light flick on to the main stage. I closed my eyes but could somehow still see everything. It was no use. I suddenly got a strong smell of sulfur like I had smelled outside the tent but this time it was stronger. I aimed my attention back to the stage where a clown sat on a small bike, but the front wheel was missing. It was nothing but the rim. As I scanned up the body of the clown I noticed his clothes were soaked in blood and dirt. I made my way up to his head which was being held on by what looked to be a slinky, or a spring like a jack in the box. His esophagus stood proudly in the middle. his skin was torn around it. ligaments and tendons stretched like nothing has been stretched before. His eyes were hanging out of their place swinging about as he rode around the stage. He stopped abruptly. Like he could tell I wasn’t enjoying the show. His head sprung forward snapping what little insides he had left. Stopping only inches from my face. He opened his mouth revealing rows of needles in replace of his teeth. “Did you enjoy?”. “What?” These were the first words I could get out. “I said…” as I blinked I saw my mom standing in front of me “did you enjoy the show?” She said smiling at me. I collapsed in her arms. She hugged me back I never wanted to leave her loving arms ever again. I could feel her worried eyes on me, but I didn’t care. I wanted to be anywhere but here.
