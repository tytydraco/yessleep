Recently I came across a collection of papers from an old banker's box in my home, buried beneath a stack of several other storage bins from a prior move. I have no memory of them nor any of their contents. The box itself is quite nondescript except for one of the two narrow sides which have just two words handwritten in flowing black ink: The Manor. Bored and looking for something to kill some time while stuck inside cleaning one week I opened it and leafed through some of the the loose pages at random. Below is my transcription of what was written on the first I read. \[I will utilize brackets to indicate portions where portions appear to have been lost or are missing, some of the pages are in poor condition. This segment appeared to be in good condition however.\]

The laboratory crackled with a palpable aura of foreboding, as the storm thundered outside. The cabinets and their glass panes bowed and flexed creating a sound which resonated throughout the halls & annexes of the building. As the lights pulsed & ebbed a low dull groan emerged from one of the cells beneath. The lone occupant of the lab reluctantly set down his grizzly instrument on the tray alongside the dissection table, where various pieces of offal & indistinguishable remnants of flesh, bone, and viscera were strewn about. The noise of forceful stomping of the man's boots upon the cold lifeless tile of room exploded cacophonously above the ambient sounds of the storm outside. The groan emanating from below slowly guttered out & was replaced by a new sound, a piteous whimper which bounced across the harsh angles & walls of the maze like chambers & corridors where the source of the noise resided. With a renewed sense of urgency the doctor ran to a lab bench messily festooned with books, rolls of paper, utensils, pools of ink, and obscure measuring devices. Depressing a small square on a neighboring specimen cupboard, the desk retracted into a previously hidden recess in the wall. It revealed a concealed trapdoor beneath which was pulled upwards by two lengths of heavy steel chain. The steps now exposed by the opening of this sepulchral entrance were steep, slick with condensation, and loomed perilously into the depths below. Taking a small rectangle of strange black glass from his coat, the man pressed it to a plate on the walls of the staircase. Gradually a series of sickly yellow lights buzzed into existence like some strange brood of firefly seething and roiling over one another. The loathsome lights which hurt to look at cast their glow onto the descending passageway & the places beyond.

The man forgoing holding onto the worn bannister rushed headlong into this hellish slope all the while the whimpering of the beast behind the noise grew louder. The man passed cell after cell without a second glance, he knew the source lay further beyond these other hapless creatures. A menagerie of strange & indistinguishable resided within these other smaller rooms. Horrific monstrosities of nightmarish proportions hunched silently against the corners of their confines. They were amalgamations of terrestrial, aquatic, and entirely otherworldly animals. Some had normal characteristics otherwise unchanged from what appeared to be their original source material, but also had properties of beasts entirely unrelated to them. One was a sickly crocodilian specimen that had enormous wings like that of a raptor & a tail not unlike that of a shark. Another an elephant without its distinctive trunk, but in its place the flailing tentacles & beak of an abyssal squid, with its entire body the same mottled white as a squid natural color. On and on the scientist went along these maddening chambers until at last he reached a door unlike all the others. This door was not a cell of iron bars or reinforced glass like the others but a single wooden door not unlike that of a quaint cottage home. The lights of the passageway's cavernous ceiling cast shadows that danced rhythmically along the wall. If someone else had been there with me watching his journey along these corridors, they could attest to the unusual shapes which clung to his shadow and moved independently of his frantic steps.

At last, having reached the door the whimpering moans of its occupant had morphed into anguished screams of terror, that sent a shockwave of force through the entirety of these labyrinthian sprawl. The man hurriedly undid a series of deadbolts, padlocks, and chains, and flung the door open. Within was a small circular room not much wider than twenty steps in any direction from its center. It was empty save for a single piece of furniture, a ceiling high mirror on the opposite half of the circle. Casting his gaze about wildly the man walked towards it and stopped suddenly when beholding its reflection. Unsurprisingly, it's surface cast back an image of the man himself, but the reflection was not true, it could not be. For in the reflection his mouth was stretched agape to a degree beyond the capabilities of facial muscles and anatomy. His feet shuffled backwards but he could not break away from the abject terror that had gripped him. The reflection of the man had raised one arm, and reached out with a sinewy finger that pointed to some place behind the man. Spinning around, the man had but a moment to see the door swing back into place, before he was plunged into complete darkness. Again a low dull groan emanated from the sprawling passages below the manor.
